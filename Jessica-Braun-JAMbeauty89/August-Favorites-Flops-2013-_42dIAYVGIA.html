favorites and flops because there are a
few things that I wasn't too impressed
with this month and I've been trying out
a lot of new things if you've watched me
my recent videos a friend of mine sent
me a lot of things and and some others I
mean I've just got a lot of things to
try out and I haven't even gotten around
to all of them which is fun because
there's so much to try but I have tried
out some things and some things I've
loved some things I have maybe not so
sure how I feel about them yet so here
we go so one of my things that I have
absolutely loved this month is my
mary-lou manizer it is from the balm and
it is a brightener type of thing like a
highlighter and I've been using this
more often as eye shadow than I have as
highlighter because look at that
pigmentation oh man so if you're using
it as a highlight you have to be very
very careful with it but as an eyeshadow
it is absolutely stunning especially for
on the lid oh and I love it so I've been
using that a lot lately it's just
gorgeous it reminds me of Cielo kitten
it's not quite as shimmery but it's
pretty darn close so I really really
like this and you can use it for two
things it's awesome
okay another favorite of mine that I I
don't know what I would do without this
it's the Neutrogena on-the-spot acne
treatment and this stuff you just it's
just a white cream and you put a little
bit on the active ingredient is benzoyl
peroxide so if you know your skin
doesn't do well with that I would stay
away but I use this at night if I've got
like a breakout or something going on
with my skin I'll put this on even for
the ones that are like under the skin
that really hurt and they haven't even
like surfaced yet you know what I mean
this is great for that like I've got one
right now that like hurt and I put this
on last night and it's like gone
it is crazy it's awesome so this stuff I
love I really don't know what I would do
without it so if you you know if you
need something like that like an
overnight treatment I really recommend
okay so another thing that I've been
loving our and you know what these don't
get enough love the covergirl eyeshadows
these are wonderful
and I know in the past I've used some
eyeshadows from covergirl like a long
long time ago like when I was in high
school and I wasn't very impressed but
they I don't know if they I'm assuming
they've improved because these are
beautiful so some of these are two
singles that I'm in love with the
covergirl champagne this is actually
reminds me of the mary lou manizer as
well look at that isn't that amazing and
then this other single it's Tapestry
taupe and this is just a gorgeous color
just in general it's just beautiful you
can wear it in the crease you can wear
it on your lid I mean to do whatever you
want with it but it's really really
pretty I think it's a really nice subtle
crease color that's how I use it
and then this covergirl trio and
shimmering sands is just beautiful a lot
of people love it they're all all three
colors are just gorgeous all trans to
watch them just in gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous
you see those it's backwards you know
what I mean though they will do no just
get smart so anyway I love this this is
probably more bang for your buck than
buying a bunch of singles however a lot
of times you can get coupons and then
use them on the singles so they're like
almost free so that's pretty awesome I
really should have gotten like a baby
wipe to wipe all these off on one day
I'll think ahead I don't know when that
day will be so one thing that I've not
been loving and I should have known is
this Physicians Formula bronzer it's
their healthy wear bronzer it's in like
the orange and pink packaging and the
only reason that I don't love it is
because it comes off I was hoping they'd
have different shades and this isn't the
shade of light and I don't even know if
there's gonna come across its kind of
orange and that's the problem for me
you know I want to win there's lighter
but this is orange it's the opposite of
what I want so I was just not impressed
with that I don't know if you can even
see it really but I don't like it I
don't know the other shades like medium
and dark and stuff might be better but
if you're a fair skinned girl don't just
it's not even worth it unless you do
want an orange bronzer maybe you do I
don't know but I wasn't impressed I
ended up getting it for like three
dollars and fifty cents at big lot so it
wasn't that big of a deal but still
regular price those are like eleven or
twelve dollars so I would have been very
upset okay my Rimmel match perfection
concealer is awesome and I felt more and
more in love with it every time I use it
I used it today and I just love it it's
the application is a brush little
applicator and it's just nice and
inexpensive and I wish more came in it
because I feel like I'm gonna fly I have
already been flying through this and I
haven't been using it every day so if I
wanted to use it every day I would be
done with this quickly so but again it's
inexpensive so it's not that big of a
deal and I have it in the shade 125 fair
a lip gloss I'm wearing it today really
simple but I just love it's the Revlon
Super Lustrous
lipstick or no lip gloss in pango peach
this is beautiful just peach colored
obviously who likes watching this on top
of things I'm sorry you guys I have it
on my lips though so really mmm it's
right there
it's just pretty it's just fun and I
think it's like so apricotty it's just
like juicy a juicy color so I really
like it and this is in the new packaging
although I'm assuming they had this
color in the old packaging too so I
don't think but I don't know you guys
can let me know if you know Oh a new one
this is the wet n wild by Fergie eyelid
primer this stuff is awesome like it
doesn't mess around
I've been using it for about a week now
and it is amazing and it's you know
three to four dollars and I know there's
coupons floating around right now for
what and oil products it's amazing and
there's a lot that comes in it and a
little bit goes a long way and it is a
nude color so it kind of cancels out any
discoloration you have and it holds onto
that shadow for real and there's so much
product in here like I probably won't
have to replace this for a long long
time I love it
like this is my new favorite eyelid
primer period so I'm really excited
about that and I like also the
applicator is the Kaymer you squeeze a
little bit out I like that better than
the
and I don't know why I just do I don't
know I feel like I have more control
okay so another new favorite of mine are
these Jordana there oh my gosh Jordana
twelve-hour made to last liquid eyeliner
pencils and I have four different shades
here I have the black which is very very
black I am gonna swatch these for you
and then I also have aqua stone which is
this like teal color blue then I have
Jay jewel which is this beautiful deep
green color and then purple fix which is
a deep purple so just watch all these
for you these are so amazing I mean
they're just amazing they are absolutely
comparable to the Urban Decay 24/7
pencils is that what they're called and
the Knicks hold on though of course it's
the one I need next and the whoops oh no
where did it go in the Nick set what are
those called the oh that's gonna drive
me nuts
I don't know but here's the black one
here's purple fix aqua stone and Jade
jewel these are so beautiful and they
say I've only been using using the black
one so far but I got the colored ones
cuz I was like I can't not get them and
I feel like they were like three dollars
they might have been three dollars and
fifty cents thirty-three dollars at
Walgreens I'm not sure how much it's
Jordanna I think to her Nana's sold at
Ulta is that correct and if so I don't
know how much they charge there but
they're around three dollars and they
have more coach - I know they had a
brown one and then that's all I've seen
I'm sure they have more these are
amazing amazing amazing if you're
looking for eyeliner pencils these are
them they are amazing they stay on all
day they just glide on so smooth it's
literally like butter and these colors
especially that aqua stone color look
how gorgeous that is oh so highly
recommend those okay
another product i was i've been
unimpressed with because i don't hate it
I'm actually wearing it today and if you
can see here's what I love about this it
holds the curl this is the physician's
formula organic wear mascara and
the pros it holds your curl all day I
swear like better than any master I've
used and I really appreciate that
however it's it's as if it never dries
if that makes any sense and all the
mascaras I use I don't use waterproof so
even regular mascaras they're usually at
least like dry but when I touch this
whether it's right now or whether it's
12 hours after I put it on it's as if
it's wet and a little bit gets on my
finger and like I sprayed a setting
spray on my face today and I got like
black all down here I was like wall
because my bottom lashes this stuff is
just if you cry or if you're okay when I
laugh really hard
I like tear up and sometimes cry and I
laughed really hard all the time so it's
a problem with this so I have to be like
careful when I use this so I don't know
that I'll repurchases this was sent to
me by my friend amber like I said I like
it but if you're if you have any
tendencies to get like wet eyes you know
what I mean it's gonna be bad news bears
for you so that's one thing to think
about but it does hold the curl so if
you're looking for one for that reason
then you might really really like this
so that's why I'm say about that okay
few more my Rimmel stay matte powder and
transparent is amazing just absolutely
amazing I'm wearing it today it really
does work better than any than anything
I mean really I can't find another one
that works as good as this just period
it is perfect and if you haven't tried
it yet it's like five dollars go try it
it's it's the best it mattifies but not
so much that you look like a cake face
it's amazing it's like it's the perfect
balancing act I don't know how it does
it I really I want to know what's in it
I mean I don't really care what say you
know I mean okay another product a newly
discovered one is this Palladio blush
it's their baked blush the shade is
blushing and
it is a beautiful color look at that it
reminds me of that blush is this remind
me of oh the hot mama blush from the
balm so if you're looking for like a
cheap alternative
this is it I mean it is beautiful I
think these are around five dollars I'm
gonna be doing a longer pull audio kind
of like the whole line review soon
button this will definitely be on it but
this is one I've been loving enough that
I just had to mention it I just had to
because I want to get more colors it's
just beautiful and they stay all day
it's beautiful um another product that I
have not been liking now let me rephrase
I like it and I've been using I just got
it but there was something they marketed
it as a brightening yeah it's called the
brightening eye perfectors the
Neutrogena healthy skin looks like this
really cute packaging actually however
it doesn't really bright and the color
is in fair which is what I would want
especially for something that's gonna be
brightening except for it's like a way
like darker color that you would
envision you see that okay it looks
really bright on here in real life yeah
it looks really bright on the camera so
it's not coming across in real life it's
more like a yellow orange tinted thing
which I like yellow-based concealer SH
but for a highlighter I don't want a
yellow-based concealer and especially if
this is the lightest shade which I think
it is I was just surprised by that now
as a concealer it's nice but I can't
really use it as a brightener I guess is
what I'm saying so don't let the name
fool ya it's more of a concealer than it
is a brightener so just keep that in
mind but it's a nice concealer it blends
well it doesn't get cakey or anything
like that throughout the day so I like
it as a concealer but not as a
brightening concealer if that makes any
sense so that's that and then also the
NYX cream blush this isn't the shade
boho-chic
oh man this stuff is amazing it's
different than any cream blush I've ever
used and it almost looks like it's like
a really moist one like it almost feels
like lip balm it litter that's what it
feels like it feels like lip balm like I
feel like I could wear this do you see
how wet that is but when you stipple it
with the stippling brush is simple it on
it is like this beautiful dewy like I
wish I had used this for my tutorial I
did for a dewy finished face I wish I'd
used this instead because
is just like ooh like sultry I love it
oh my gosh so these I know around like
$5 give or take I'm saying everything's
$5 I think it really is around $5 at
Ulta and there's a kind of a swatch of
it but it doesn't look like that when
you put it on because you're stippling
it on so it kind of looks more
airbrushed it's gorgeous and this shade
boho chic is beautiful too so now this
is the only one I have I want to go get
more as if I need any more hey speaking
of my latest video before this was my
updated makeup collection and storage if
you haven't seen it I'm very proud of it
