some unboxings for you I'm unboxing two
different versions of the choco kirb box
I've linked coffee break with Dani
because she was the one that introduced
a lot of us to this box at least for me
she had done a video and I was like what
and then I got in contact with a company
and so this video is done in
collaboration with them but I'm so
excited because oh my gosh I love
chocolate so much but I'm also gonna
unbox the fabfitfun box for fall which
is amazing as well so let's start with
choco carp I have two different boxes to
show you guys this is their original box
and then this is their Nano box so of
course the Nano is a little bit less so
it's a lot cheaper so I'll have info and
links for both of these down below let's
start with the Nano one I just want to
eat chocolate let us be real here so
when you open it it's just cute so comes
like in the little pouch here to be
honest with you I'm really hungry and I
didn't eat before filming today so I'm
just like legitimately hungry so I'm is
fill up on chocolate so this came oh my
gosh
with three different products so this
first one is called Willy's cacao milk
of the Gods Venezuelan Rio cutter ebay
creamy milk chocolate with nutty and
coffee notes I feel like this is like
Willy Wonka like do I have the golden
ticket oh my gosh so it's like three
chocolate bars mmm it's really good it's
not like Hershey's chocolate where you
know what to expect this one has like a
little nutty twist to it and it's really
really good but there's not like nuts in
it you know like chunks of nuts all
right that was incredible I'm like
trying to only eat a little bit of each
so I can get through this and still be
hungry for dinner because we're supposed
to go to dinner soon
alright so this is the coconut dream bar
my Yanna chocolate is the brand crispy
coconut cookie salted caramel and creamy
coconut and 66% dark chocolate my
husband is gonna want to try all of
these too so I need to make sure I leave
one for him look at this it's like a
giant
the bar type oh my gosh has anyone
else's mouth watering
alright so we're driving in Tyler you
have to try this ice cream no yelloww
saving it for later isn't that good I
know cuz it's got like the crunch and
the coconut in it and it's like legit
dark chocolate yeah you know what though
we should freeze the rest of this
wouldn't be good for ozone look like a
giant glass of milk oh my gosh so the
next one is dolphin the art of blending
Chocola made in Belgium and it's dulce
de leche and Rees souffle so it's like
in a package almost like you like open
it up and then you slip the like
chocolate bar out of here it's crunchy
yes it's like a you know like the
crackle bars how there's like the crisp
rice type thing mmm
oh my gosh it's all so good and it's so
different than what you get at the store
which is why I like it that was awesome
so that was the Nano box
let's open like their original size it's
bigger still craving chocolate so that's
a good that's the good news
yeah it's talking about genuine
chocolate tears work incredibly hard to
perfect their amazing products it's just
talking about you know how there really
is a big difference between chocolate
you just buy at the store and chocolate
that is made by like I mean it's kind of
artistic and it does have a different
taste and I totally agree bigger there's
more I'm so excited so this box has five
things in it I'm gonna have a bunch of
half-eaten chocolate bars so this is
Fran's chocolates crunch bar with
roasted nibs that word is so funny to me
64% cacao it has nibs of cacao I was
gonna say that is like punch you in the
face chocolatey but like really good but
like deep and rich that would be because
they have the actual cacao pieces in it
that makes sense it's really really good
my husband will
like this even more than I do because he
loves the hit for him the darker the
better
next thing see already even the
packaging is cute next thing is this
dick Taylor craft chocolate and it's in
maple coconut says 72% Belize Oh me and
I actually ripped it off shredded
coconut caramelized with maple syrup and
sea salt paired with our 72% Belize is
what it says
guys it's golden ticket again even more
golden ticket II need you to validate me
what does this make you think of when I
do this have you done it yeah but I was
trying to look all don't what in the
absolute I know I know but it's so
golden ticket II write like I need
domination on that okay so now that I
know that it is a golden ticket look at
this so the actual chocolate is like
beautiful in like edge to look at the
back I'm so excited I don't want to ruin
it okay hmm again so dark what's so so
good alright next thing is this vibra
chocolate Thai satay bar chocolate visit
to Thailand with a bit of tropical heat
oh my gosh I get nervous with these like
spicy ish Pro I mean it can't be that
spicy right wow it's like a big bar
alright let's see just how spicy this
thing is
it's like hitting me slot I've never had
chocolate like this it's spicy like it
feels like I just need a buffalo wing
it's so good though like it has this
taste it tastes more milk chocolatey so
if you don't like dark you'd really like
this but it it has I've never had
anything like this it really does have
that kick to it but not so much that it
burns your taste buds and you feel like
you can't eat anything else until you
get like milk or bread like it's just
the perfect amount again my husband will
love that all right let's keep a-movin
this next thing is this show cola martyr
modere new york and it's NYC street nuts
bar our exuberant take on a New York
City tradition milk chocolate
caramelized almonds cashews and peanuts
with sea salt it looks really really
good this might be my favorite one I
don't know it really might be because I
love I just love all chocolate but the
nuts in are so I mean they're like those
Street roasted nuts you get that have
like the sugar and stuff on them they're
just so good so mixing them together is
like perfect and it's crunchy get it
last thing in this box is this J cocoa
and a mom a sea salt and milk chocolate
I am very excited about this oh this is
so cute it's three different bars I mean
I think they're the same thing but
they're just let's see yeah they're the
same bar they're just different like
pictures and stuff like retro well like
vintage photos gluten-free Seattle
Chocolate Company okay oh my gosh you
can't even see the edamame oh my gosh
I'm so excited
mmm that was really good because it had
that salty crunch like edamame does when
it's roasted like that but milk
chocolate - it was a really good combo I
really liked that so those were both of
the choco core boxes like I said I'll
have all the info for those below if
you're interested thank you chocolate
kerb for working with me on this video
let's go ahead and open the fabfitfun I
have a promo code for fabfitfun down
below if you are interested in it I'm
just excited because it's fall and this
really like I peeked in here and I lost
my mind because it is like the most fall
box I've ever received in my whole life
so let's dig in so it always comes with
a magazine just about things going on
and like what's just about what's in the
box and how to wear it and all kinds of
things like that oh my gosh are you
serious the box looks so pretty and I
just dumped it all over the floor well
now I'm going to show you the weird
dumped version I'm excited about what's
on top let's just start with that so
this is by ModCloth and it is this
blanket scarf it's a ball it's really
really soft and it's just like you can
bend it easily I've had some scarves
like this that we're really really big
they were blanket scarves but they
weren't easy to like maneuver and they
weren't really soft but this one is so
I'm so excited that and I think these
colors are so pretty and unique next
thing in here are these socks it's the
brand is toe socks xox made exclusively
for fabfitfun and you'll see they're
just gray and of course your toes are
like free in them and then they have
like that kind of traction on the bottom
so I'm excited about those and it looks
like they kind of hug your mid foot area
I don't know the technical term for next
thing in here are these colored pencils
says pencils of promise it's a for
purpose organization founded in 2008 to
access increasing access to quality
education for kids in the developing
world pencils of promise at work well
you know I'm big on that because of
course I'm in ng
and I think obviously that that would be
important for everyone to have access to
so it's just got these colored pencils
that's so cute and I will use them
because I do have a couple coloring
books they're all Disney ones they're
not even like grown-up coloring books
now like I've moved on to just kid
Disney coloring books because that's
what I like next thing in here is from
pure cosmetics not pure P you are but
pure like that regular word nude
collection I shadow I mean this looks
legit feels just like The Naked 2
packaging it looks just like the naked -
hmm shall we compare so same size this
is interesting
exactly look at this
so those are the exact same let's swatch
though I'm so curious Wow I mean they
kick up some powder but I mean that's
really really pigmented they're close
but not quite so like this was the peer
collection or pure cosmetics that one is
the Naked 2 I think this one's pure
collection and that one's naked too so
they're really really similar but not
quite but I mean if you're wanting the
Naked 2 you could totally get this other
one now here's the thing the pur
cosmetics one is $50 and the naked 2 I
think is either 52 or 54 now so if
you're gonna get one or the other I mean
why would you not go with the urban
decay if they're about the same price
but this one does seem nice I'll have to
try it out and see like is it the same
quality those were really nice
interesting but I'm excited about that
mean that's awesome I just wish it like
if it were gonna be the exact same thing
that maybe it were cheaper the next
thing is this sponge la Bulgarian rose
body wash infused buffer I'm so excited
it definitely has a rose scent and oh so
it's kind of squishy like a sponge but
it's got body wash in it you can tell
it's kind of moist so I am so excited
I've never tried anything like this so
I'm intrigued by it and I will
definitely use it let's see what it says
um cleanses exfoliates hydrates and
massages yeah that's pretty much it but
that's awesome and it's cruelty free as
well next thing oh my gosh this is a
coffee cup that says joy comes in the
morning I love that because coffee is
the best and I love that it's black with
the gold it's just so cute and I feel
like these together is like the cutest
thing ever
oh my gosh I'm so excited for fall next
thing is this skin laundry restoring
night serum so that sounds awesome
find the evening after cleansing before
moisturizing place three to four drops
in the palm of your hands apply to face
and neck sweet I will definitely use
that the skin care they usually send is
actually usually very nice another thing
in here is this travel size see
here at outlast deodorant it's clear
I'll probably give it a try Oh No if
you've watched any of my like product
regrets or products I don't like this is
always in it this is by Tanja crooks
it's called the brow brow gal it's a
clear brow gel and it makes your lashes
crunchy which that's fine for me like I
don't mind that but it left like a weird
white crusty film all around my brows
every time I use it and I was like nope
done there are too many decent ones out
there for me to waste my time so this
next one is by Mullane and Sparrow and
it's their body oil and French lavender
it says it's skin firming hydrating ooh
it's really pretty too very classy apply
sparingly and massage into skin with
mindfulness and long circular strokes
recommended for use as a daily
moisturizer and for self massage that's
pretty awesome it does say to apply it
to daenam skin so excited let's smell it
it has a very light lavender scent it
definitely is lavender but it's not too
strong so that is so awesome huh they
said a color move to go with the colored
pencils it's a nature 100 it's an adult
one I don't know if I can handle it I
won't give it a try those are really
really pretty so that is awesome and the
last thing in here is this cotton L for
fabfitfun it's just like their cotton L
like cleansing wipes so that's awesome
so that was a whole lot of pricing in my
promo code down below for this hopefully
you enjoy the video and I hope that you
will subscribe before you leave and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
