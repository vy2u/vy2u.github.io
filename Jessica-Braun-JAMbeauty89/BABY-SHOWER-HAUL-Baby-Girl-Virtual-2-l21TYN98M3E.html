it's just like unbelievably overwhelming
but without being said we are so
grateful for all the stuff we are so
excited to share with you some of it
we've already opened a lot of it we have
not some of it's from our registry a lot
of it's not and it's so fun
so Murphy just from what I know I like
you breathe you know well yeah you're
something new been pregnant I'm like
okay there's just no room for anything
innards no no we've already focused the
camera this is happening all right let's
get out so this is the best kind of baby
shower baby shower it's the best kind of
baby shower because we're sitting here
in our PJs oh yeah PJ pants they do
pants galore and that's the only way to
do a baby shower I'm pretty sure when we
have the baby shower with family and
friends
PJ's yeah no no I am wearing PJs that's
the point it sounds good we're having a
co-ed baby shower and it's gonna sell
go ahead put a my 10 going were in
college yeah I guess I feel like it's
like a camp thing like oh okay this is
genuine excited about a trash alright
who is this problem who sent this to us
hold on it's right here yeah it off the
side oh goodness
well I'll talk about it while he figures
on this from oh my gosh so this was on a
registry it's the bub EULA I think
that's how it set steel diaper pail and
gray and we got it because you know they
sell special bags that you can use with
it um but it's just you know like the
diaper genie there a couple brands that
do it but this one I remember it was
really cool because of the way you put
it in there's no like separate bag that
twists like the diaper genie so how that
one works I have no idea it's something
about the contraption where when it
opens you drop it in and then you put it
this open generous little top part opens
up you put the diaper on it you close
the top and then light goes into the bag
yeah and then I get an airplane so you
close the toilet lid and then you press
the button and go fish we when we first
worked realized we were gonna have a
baby we were like oh we don't need a
special I just liked okay we went to buy
my baby and the lady showed us isn't
really and we went to Babies R Us and it
was going out of business near us yeah
and we went and were like oh maybe we'll
find some deals we both had to go to the
bathroom of course I think it classic
luckily I only had to go once because
and I don't know if it is because it was
going out of business but their bathroom
smelled like diaper city it was the it
was the most pungent and I they had like
a thing in there but they just give it
up like no one had changed them the bag
or you know it was horrible
yeah cuz I mean I was like my eyes were
stinging on the way out like this it was
awful it was awful
I'm pretty sure so now I'm sold I'm like
okay whatever we're getting I'm so
excited about this it was bad so this
was Terry thank you Terry oh my gosh
I learned this is one of the things that
was most excited about it that's so
weird I know because the second that the

Pinocchio and then she also said this
baby can expand I am like falling in
love with this brand baby safe laundry
essentials so it's got like steam spray
and detergent and it looked a fabric
softener sheet so I'm like that is
always not sure clothes separate from
ours yeah for a while good enough for a
while these are things I'm slowly
learning cuz she frankly I did not know
that I would have known that before you

like silicone and you can play we're
talking about yes where you can put like
actual food in it you know to a
certainty like a strawberry or something
right your I think so I don't know
exactly but the idea is that it's the
holes are so tiny so it gets a taste and
all that from it but they're not
actually swallowing anything whole you
know what I mean there's no danger of
that and I think that is so so neat so
I'm excited I don't know exactly what

wealthy they may relate she was outside
in her teeth to receive your keyboard
out of her mind we were watching that
interview with one of the actresses and
they were talking about how crown it
also had to do with like their German
heritage that was part of the reason why
their accent was the way it was I know
how I know I don't know it's but it's if
you don't why dream it the White Rabbit

so that was incredible I am obsessed
with literally everything you know six
months ago I didn't want a kid not that
I didn't want a kid I was very uncertain
about having a kid and now I'm obsessed
I I'm like I'm like let's get it let's
get this give this girl a three let's do
this thing I know I feel like and I feel
like when we you know we weren't
necessarily planning this and it just
kind of happened the way it happened and
I think both of us were like oh my gosh
like like all right we're here this is
happy I mean it's happening like we
literally were sitting there no no this
might be TMI I say we were like we found
out at the same time yeah yeah we were
pregnant and so we both like literally
the second 1/2 all right let's do it
we dome head first
we like fell this is incredible we know
how blessed we are we know how fortunate
and we have the you guys to think I I I
know you almost don't know what to say
because it is I know some people
watching this or thinking like oh my
gosh because I know I would think this
if I were watching another youtuber
opening all this stuff I'd think why are
people sending her that stuff I mean she
can afford this stuff we are incredibly
grateful to you guys but we always
wanted to be known please don't feel
pressured to send us things we we
absolutely appreciate everything you
guys have set we will use all of this
stuff anything we won't use for one
reason or another whether she grows out
of it before she can actually fish
especially these cohorts Golden Girls
enoki oh my heart belongs Pinocchio but
anything that's for whatever
anything that we can't use for one
reason or another we are going to donate
that way someone that is not quite as
fortunate can use it because obviously
and I know that my sister works with
that altar that yeah there's a specific
name for the one but I think it's more
of a local thing yeah but she works well
yeah that you know it'd be the perfect
place to donate it and I think they'll
even take like gently use things oh you
know so we're figuring that out on our
end but we are so incredibly thankful
and grateful and I hope that that does
not go unnoticed
that's not the way no I hope that that
is obvious and it is and we're so
excited and I I wish that having all of
this stuff took away the fear of like
the actualities like howdy but I know
that so much of this stuff is just gonna
make our life easier it's gonna enrich
her life all of these books and her
little tool chest and other things that
just make our lives easier as we're
figuring out how to raise her like the
little hatch baby little nightlight and
you know all of those kinds of in her
college savings the diaper pail for the
night or is it 529 529 whatever anyway
so thank you guys so so much I don't
know what else to say
I guess I just yeah thank you thank you
so much honestly from the bottom of our
hearts yeah it words can't express know
how grateful we are and when we don't
yeah and we don't know if we'll do any
more of these this is the second one
we've done just because as we get closer
and more tired she wonders if our
mattress in the crib mattress and the
crib but I'm just getting more and more
tired and I'm trying to still film you
know beauty videos for my channel and
things like that because it is one of my
jobs so we'll see but I'm not no smog
though you know we I'm doing a lot of
older videos on my channel like it but
we're gonna try and do like one of our
like normal vlogs every week on my
channel and then this every other week
we'll do like a like an older video but
that we are you still gonna drink you
back to life we're talking about you
putting the nursery together and yeah
and you'll see stuff so like if you've
sent us something and for some reason we
didn't get it like we know there's some
stuff at the peel box we weren't able to
get it's a long story so when we get
that if it's not
shown in like one of these kinds of
videos I will try to show it like in
vlogs on his channel so or maybe even
like on snapchat or yeah yeah so we're
so sorry if you were like dying to be in
a video of these and I hope that's not
why you sent it but anyway we're just so
grateful we'll shut up cuz this video
has to be like an hour and a half long
it's at least if you stuck with this
this long you are a true-blue loyal
subscriber and amazing so we will sign
off there I hope you were subscribed to
both of our channels if you're not and
