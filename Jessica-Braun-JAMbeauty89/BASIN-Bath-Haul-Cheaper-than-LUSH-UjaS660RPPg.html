to be back I don't know I just stole my
Disney World haul and Disney Paris haul
and it's getting me way too long and I
that might already be up I don't know
what water I'm putting these in but now
it's my Basin haul which I actually
bought all of this stuff in Disney World
where they have a basin store in the
Grand Floridian and at Downtown Disney
and Tyler I went a little crazy cuz
we're newlyweds and it's just exciting
and there's all this bubbles stuff a
bubble bath stuff and we were just got
excited so we'd bought way too much but
it was so fun and he was so cute in
there because he was actually helping me
pick stuff out of so cute anyway um so
actually he we blogged while we were in
there but he's still working on all of
our Disney World vlog so they're not all
up yet I can link it below if it is up
his vlogs because we both had a lot of
fun in there anyway so let's get right
into it the first thing we saw when we
went and there were these tubs of bath
salts that you could just scoop into
your own little jars and Tyler was all
about that he was like wait you get to
scoop them in yourself like yeah he's
like wait like these are like vials so
like I know this like I feel like a mad
scientist might all right calm down but
we picked these out they had like I want
to say maybe nine or ten options and you
could get like six for a better deal
than you would buying them all separate
and then you'd get the little bag with
it so I mean I think you only save like
a couple bucks but we were like in why
not um so and okay I gotta tell you guys
this he said oh yeah we should get all
of them and let's make sure we get
different colors I think that would be a
really nice Instagram picture for you um
I probably would be up to post a picture
on Instagram just to appease I'm so so
cute so we got one called sunshine and
it's yellow and these are just bath
salts - you know what I like about bath
salts is when I use them they make my
skin feel moisturize when I get out of
the tub it's so weird it's like it makes
the water so soft and sunshine really
does smell really fresh but sweet fresh
I don't really know how to describe that
but it smells really really
and all of the stuff is available online
by the way I can link each thing below
the pink one I think was called pink
sugar and it smells just like sweet spun
sugar at Target if you know that candle
it's exactly it's like cotton candy
heaven this will probably be one I use
myself just hello this one was called
stop Zuma I think if I'm saying that
right it this one was my favorite it's
mint it reminds me of the body shop it's
got this very I don't know it's a
foreign smell to me it's not a smell I'm
used to but it smells incredible I don't
know how to describe it's like spicy yes
sweet and clean it's like everything
mixed into one it's amazing this one is
called lavender I think and it smells
exactly as you would expect Tyler really
likes this one it is a really nice scent
and then these last two I don't remember
the names but I will certainly have them
below the blue one smells like very
clean it makes me think of like when
candles are named like ocean waters like
that kind of a smell and then the last
one is this kind of cream-colored one
and it smells very sweet but musky it's
like musky and sweet I'm sure I know you
guys I'm not a I don't know how to
describe smells very well but I think
I'd get okay anyway those are I'm so
excited to use all of those and what I
like about Basin so far everything is
cheaper than lush and I have tried lush
products and they're great I mean I
don't nothing against lush I like it but
this is just a little bit cheaper so I
was very excited everything was about $1
$2 cheaper for every single item so
overall if I were to about all of this
stuff like the bath bombs and the soap
at lush I probably would have spent like
15 or 20 dollars more so that was a
bonus so we got six different bath bomb
they have three sizes of bath bombs
small medium and large and I think we
got three small on three medium and
these are cheaper than lushes bath bombs
as well and bath bombs it is cool could
you put them in your bath under the
running water just fizzes and again it
feels really nice and it's
smells really good so one of the medium
ones we got was one called blue Mickey
or just Mickey but it was the blue one
they had like a white one called Mickey
and it just smells again like that blue
like ocean waters that kind of smell but
adds a little Mickey's that'll float
around in your tub afterwards so I
thought that was so fun the medium that
they all were like three for a certain
amount and the medium ones for three for
fifteen say ended up means five dollars
each but of course if you buy them alone
I think they're like five ninety nine or
something this one was called vanilla
oak and it smells that's kind of got
that swirly design it smells like musky
vanilla I mean it's a very aptly titled
fat bomb but it smells so good trying to
loved that one and then the last medium
one we got was called blush and this is
one that I really liked it is like a
light pink swirl and it smells just
sweet again it's kind of got a perfume
smell so it's not necessarily one Tyler
would like and frankly you'd probably
smell like this afterwards which would
be funny but so this is more of just a
girly one but I really really like that
too so we've got two of the sandalwood
and patchouli
I'm one's oh my gosh it smells
incredible Tyler uses the sandalwood
shaving stuff and it smells absolutely
incredible and that's what it smells
like to me so we got two of those cuz he
loves that smell and I definitely love
that smell and then the last small bath
bomb we got it's just called blue river
like this one it smells like it's like a
almost like a periwinkle blue it just
smells clean you know the only they
don't have a huge selection is not true
they've got a pretty decent selection
but I I felt like after I smelled a few
I'm like okay they all kind of smell the
same so that was one kind of downside
now I'm really excited about the last
few things I got so I got some soaps for
different holidays coming up just cuz
it's so fun to me and I just am very a
very festive person so this one I got
for the fall or Halloween and it was
just called Jack and it's a
jack-o'-lantern it has that kind of fall
smell to it like it kind of smells like
spices but also like pumpkin pie mixed
together it smells amazing
and then for Christmas time I got this
one called Mickey but it's like the
holiday Mickey version and it smells
like nutmeg and like Christmas trees
mixed together you can't smell it
through the wrapper I wish I could but
it's incredible and then this one I got
to use right now it's also called Mickey
but it's just like the regular one it I
don't remember what this smelled like
but I remember it smelled really good
whatever it was and I just loved it it's
so cute so I'm gonna put this in our
kitchen now and then the last thing I
got at the checkout we were about to
check out and I saw this and I was like
I want to see if it works it was called
dr. spa and it's like a soap bar but I
guess you rub it on spots on your
clothes and they said it literally has
worked on a hundred percent of stains
they ever use it on on every fabric
they've tried it on I'm like what so I
mean that was such an outrageous claim
I'm like I gotta try it it's like $6.99
but I'm like if this works this could
last a really long time and it's so much
cheaper having one of these for a long
time than going through bottles of shell
I act like I've got kids I just get
stains on my clothes all the time
I am the messiest eater I'm just very
very clumsy so I feel like I'm going
through bottles of shout like crazy so
so excited to give this a try I'll have
to let you guys know so those are all
the things I got at base then again if
you're interested in any of them I'll
leave them below it was just so fun to
go shopping there and it makes me want
to try out lush again I really haven't
gotten lush products in a very long time
again not for any reason I just haven't
so I think when I run out of this stuff
I'll either if I love it I might just go
on basin's website and order more
because it's cheaper but I also want to
get back into lush too and try some more
of it because I just forgot about all of
this bath stuff anyway I hope you
enjoyed definitely check out my other
videos and subscribe if you enjoyed and
here's my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
