doing a video cuz I want to UM I haven't
what it will DUP okay calm down Jess
this is a video about some of my
favorite bath products not sponsored not
nothing this is a store in Disney and so
like for years I've gone to Disney
springs which used to be called Downtown
Disney
when Tyler and I would go to Disney
World we always go to Downtown Disney /
Disney springs and they have a base in
there which this is if you know it's
just a bath product company to make soap
things like that as well and so ever
since that very first time I went in I
remember a couple years ago early on my
channel I'd gone and I did like a basin
Hall and there's something about that
that like to me it's like nostalgic now
and I feel like I hadn't bought from
Basin in a while like I'd buy little
things here and there we go so this past
summer I went I bought some more bath
bombs and things like that and then I
don't know if I posted I don't know
where I posted about I don't know if it
was like on snapchat probably snapchat
Jessica because we always like vlog on
Instagram stories and snapchat while
we're there and then we do like our
official vlogs on Tyler's channel which
is Tyler travels TV go check it out
anyway so Basin I guess found out that I
knew about them love that I don't know
whatever and so they contacted me and
basically said hey we'll send you some
more products I'm like like I was so
excited cuz to me Basin is like like I
said nostalgic and like old-school
Disney to be old-school it's like only a
couple years ago Jess but it's just
special and I love their bath bombs and
I always like every time I like take the
time to buy them there I like have to
package them in my like suitcase so
carefully and so I use them so sparingly
at home so the fact that they were gonna
send me some more stuff I was like gosh
like I've already bought a bunch of
stuff so I'm gonna show you the stuff I
bought first and then this stuff they
sent they don't know that I'm filming
this video I mean they sent it probably
hoping that I would mention it but I
just figured I'd show to you guys cuz I
really do like this brand of stuff so I
know that you can buy their stuff online
of course you don't have to be in Disney
so I'll link whatever I can or at least
their website below so
I went in and I was getting their bath
bombs and they have like these big I'll
show you in a minute these big things
you can buy and fill for like a certain
price like 20 or 25 bucks you fill as
many bath bombs as you can of course
they know how many you're probably gonna
be able to fit in there anyway but I
just wanted to get some that I could
still take home cuz this was gonna take
a lot of room in my luggage so I was
like no Andres guy you can't do that so
I got three of their I think like their
medium size or small sized bath bombs so
one of them I don't remember I just got
three and three of the same kind you
could mix and match if you wanted but
one of them I think the purple one is
maybe lavender and then this one was
like relaxing I think is what it was
called and I was like every time I get a
bath it's always because I need to relax
so I wanted more relaxing scents and
lavender and whatever this was was like
exactly what I wanted so I got three of
those I'm so excited you know the
reality is they have these giant ones
and those are all great and dandy but to
me I'm like I don't want to use that
whole thing in a bath that's a lot and
you know these are expensive but with
this size I don't feel as bad using the
whole thing and I don't want to take the
time I know I know some people take the
time to cut it and cut it I've tried
that in the past and it was a nightmare
and so I'm like forget it I'm just gonna
get smaller once and just use the whole
thing
so I was all excited about those then I
saw and these were new to me and I even
asked the worker there I was like hey do
you like are these new these are their
bath bomb marbles and I'm like these are
so cute so I got two different kinds I
got three of each but I figure this is
easy to pack and travel with but they're
just these cute little tiny bath bombs
and I thought you could use one you
could use two I had to call it take a
pause and call Tyler in here because I
couldn't get the lid off the thing I was
talking about and then he brought these
in and if you have not had we bought
found them in a store near us called my
er but it's the brand is second nature
it's their wholesome medley it's nuts
and dark chocolate chunks and dried
fruit and it's unbelievable it's
unbelievable okay so these bath bomb
marbles I got one that's like orange and
yellow and one that's like pink I'm so
sorry that I don't remember the names I
feel like these were cherry and this was
like I don't know it reminds me of my
face
Center their bath salt which is Satsuma
oh my gosh I'll show you in a minute
anyway I thought these are so cool so
I'm excited to try these out late you
guys know how I like them but I love the
idea of that
so I also purchased two of their little
fr to use some two of their little bath
salts you can fill they all smell so
good but my two favorite this one is oh
crap I don't remember what it's called I
can put it on the screen because I can
look it up but I love this one it's a
really soft and sweet smell kind of
vanilla e and then Satsuma is my
favorite very energizing smell but I
just love it I don't know how to
describe it so energizing in like I
don't even want to call it citrusy cuz I
feel like it's not but oh man I love
these so I had originally when I first
tried bass and I bought like all of
their kinds but I kind of narrowed it
down this time cuz I'm like these are my
two favorites maybe it's called like
enchanted sands or something like that I
actually used this in Disney we had a
bath in the resort was saying and I was
like my feet were so tired every night
so I would get a bath every night and
just use I just use a little bit cuz I
wanted to bring it home
alright so now one of the things they
sent for me to try
they sent me a lot of their soaps if you
are into bar soaps you will love these
Tyler and I for a while we had them and
then we didn't so we got rid of our
little like cute soap dishes we had and
I'm like cleaning I wish I hadn't cuz
now we have all these um this one's
grapefruit look at this one princess
it's got a little crown in it and they
literally have these giant like bars of
these that they can cut it's so cool
Florida sunshine I love all the designs
in these we used to have like a
Halloween and a Christmas one um I think
we used those up though
then lavender or my favorite scents and
then this one didn't have a name but it
kind of looks like villainy doesn't it
look like a villain anyway um so what's
fun is because they're also in Disney
they do have like more kind of fun more
whimsical ones and they also
specifically Disney ones in there
like they have a Mickey bath bomb things
like that so they also sent lip balm and
I've never tried these but even Tyler I
was like ooh like well there's one in
here he's like can I have that one I'm
like a course but I love you know they
use really good ingredients so I'm
excited so there's there Basin white
natural lip balm and vanilla mint that
one sounds up my alley
there's their iced pear lip balm and
then there's just their coconut lip balm
so we'll see which one Tyler wants one
but I don't know which one like don't
take the basin white one I really want
that but really excited about that this
oh they sent two more of their bath
salts and it looks like shut suma is one
of them and I'm like yes the other one
is white let me smell boo coconut
definitely coconut so that one smells
really really nice I don't remember that
one in store but either way pumped about
that oh my gosh
and then this I wanted to buy for so
long and I never do because I know I'm
not gonna be able to travel with it it
is there I need to like mix it up
truly mix it up but it's there sugar
scrub they have this section the milder
store where you can use their scrubs and
wash your hands your hands you put the
scrub on it and they're like the softest
like things you've ever felt you don't
want to like touch anything ever again
amazing so I'm so excited Tyler was
excited when I showed him this because
he was like get that stuff that you use
on your hands me wash I'm like yeah that
stuff because he knows how unbelievable
it feels so really excited about that
and he pointed out that it's in a
plastic container which is nice because
I once made my own coffee scrub and I
put it in a glass container and it
shattered what was I thinking I don't
know they also sent one of their body
butters and I've ever tried these either
other than like how do you know if I've
tried it in a test or in store but that
is great because I figure I can use this
right now on my baby bump especially but
it's their base and white brand body
butter it almost smells like frosting
but like a hint of frosting like not
anyway
I am really excited about this because
that feels crazy moisturizing and you
know the reality is some of these are
not cheap like
not I think that their bath bombs are
cheaper than lushes but I mean these are
still like the body scripts were kind of
expensive so they really are like I kind
of expect them to be nice you know what
I mean
so they also sent a this is probably the
thing I was the most excited about a
thing of bath bombs but there's a big
sighs oh my gosh so we've got all
different kinds in here I am so excited
to try again we feel guilty using them
maybe I will break them up we'll see but
really really cool stuff so it's
definitely worth checking out if you're
into this kind of thing I mean if you're
not then it's it's probably not worth
checking out you probably not even
watching the video and it's a brand that
I feel like no one talks about and they
deserve more love because they're so
good and I feel like we all hear about
lush so much especially in the earlier
days of YouTube we hear about lush a ton
but it's like lush is great and I have
got products of their and but I feel
like this stuff is just as good if not
better and no one really talks about it
I hope you enjoyed the video if you did
give it a thumbs up and if you're
interested in our Disney vlogs we have
them over on Tyler's channel I'll link
