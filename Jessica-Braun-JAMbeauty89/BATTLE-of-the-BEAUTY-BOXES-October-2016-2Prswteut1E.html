an unboxing of four subscription boxes
I'm finally just compiling all these
into one
I have unboxed all of these before I've
got it C Birchbox and boxycharm but I
also have the beautycon box which I've
never unboxed before in my life I've
never received all of these boxes are
sent to me complimentary for me to do
with what I please I like to show them
to you guys so if you like subscription
box unboxings check out my playlist I've
been doing this for years on my channel
every single month other than that let's
go and get into this month's unboxings
unboxings that sounded weird anyway
let's start with the beautycon cuz I'm
just so intrigued by this I will have
info and links for all of these and if I
have any like percent off referral codes
or anything I will put those below as
well so this just kind of came off and
just kind of a cute like grid box I'm
just so excited
so it says oh hey beauty why are you
reading this unboxing already and then
it gives you tips for the perfect
unboxing thank you alright so the first
thing I see wow it's like gold and is
the two people that I think they did
this with which is Shayla and Angel so
let's dig in wow there's a lot in here
let me move some things out of the way
here alright so let me just give you a
little peek inside so first thing I see
some candy these are sugarfina little I
guess little gummy so that's pretty
awesome I think this card has info no it
just has like their hat not hashtags
they're like usernames on I guess
Twitter and stuff anyway um yeah they're
little sugar lips so awesome the next
thing in here that just looks so cute is
this little pin I'm getting really into
pens I already am semi into them just
because of Disney if you're disney not
like me you know what I mean but I've
just gotten into pins just putting them
like on my bag or like we travel all the
time so putting on my suitcase or my
like little travel purse I have things
like that just a little lipstick so that
is really cute the next thing oh it's
from this bait brand called the brow gal
by Tanya crooks and
if you have watched me recently there's
this product from this brand that's a
brow gel that I hate but this is not the
brow gel it's their highlighter pencil
so let us see this brand is really like
all over the can I get it out Jessica
can you be smarter from the box there we
go okay so it's a dual ended pencil it
looks like one side is more golden the
other side is called nude gold and nude
so let's see so there's the gold side
and there's the nude side looks really
pretty they do look nice and shimmery
which is nice of course if you are
wanting to highlight with it you could
do you know down your nose if you wanted
things like that let's keep going so
that look I mean those really do they
seem a little bit like creamy in a good
way but they also kind of blend easily
which is the key the next thing in here
are these simple face wipes in all my
years of buying facial wipes I've never
actually bought the simple ones I've
never even tried them so I will
definitely try these out and let you
guys know how I feel says it removes
waterproof mascara so we will see and it
looks like there's coupons in there as
well two dollars off so if I like them I
mean two dollars off that's a nice chunk
and it says now they're even softer so I
will definitely try this out the next
thing here is this Milani shadow it's a
single in Bella cappuccino I want to say
I've had this before and I think it's a
really pretty color these are really
really buttery and smooth but I think it
was one of those things that you know
have single eyeshadows you just never
reach for like if you've got a palette
or a bunch of palettes you just always
end up reaching for those over the
single shadows so I might not even open
this one I might pass this on to a
sister that would actually use it
because I know I'm going to open it I'm
going to swatch it and then eventually I
won't ever use it now get rid of it but
these shadows are really nice if you're
in the market for some single shadows
next thing in here is this Oprah
long-lasting liquid lipstick in mocha
tried a couple of theirs and I like them
I don't know that I've tried mocha
though and it looks oh my gosh it's the
perfect color look at that I mean
quintessential fall yes and these have
my favorite vanilla sweet smell I love
it so that will definitely get more this
fall probably tomorrow to work next
thing is this lucky brush there another
that's really common in subscription
boxes I'm kind of realizing pretty
quickly and I think I literally have I
don't know if I have this brush yet this
is their 504 large ankle this is great
for gosh you could use it for blush can
almost use it to set your under eye
maybe it's a little big for that you
could use it for blush highlight maybe
bronzer might be a little small for that
either way so something to think about
these are soft I really like that
they're light pink the next thing in
here is this mystic tan mocha kissed
bronzer lotion so it says you gradually
build a natural tan so it sounds like
it's like the natural glow so if I don't
want to put it on my hand in case it
like stains and then I you know but I
will definitely try this this would be
perfect like I found that like all use
natural glow for a while and I'll be
like wow like my skin really does look a
lot healthier just a little bit deeper
but then I'll go on a trip and I want
that to continue but I'm usually flying
and I don't usually check a bag so the
thing is too big so this would be
perfect to kind of add to my bag so
it'll fit in my checked or my carry-on
luggage
next thing is from as you a oh that's
like an expensive brand essential lip
enhancer so it's their conditioning lip
treatment I think this is one thing that
I think used to be like on my wish list
and I just haven't bought it yet I can't
tell if there's a smell or not doesn't
seem it's just a clear kind of lip balm
but kind of glossy type thing I don't
think this is their full size I think
it's like half the size but still I mean
a decent amount so I will definitely I'm
actually really excited about that very
very useful to me hint buy a real life
next thing in here is kind of like this
little duo there's a lot in here these
are the flutter lashes and it looks like
these are limited edition without makeup
Shayla so they look really pretty I
don't usually wear fake lashes but
they're really dramatic you can tell and
it also came with some duo lash glue so
if you are into that that's pretty cool
and then the last thing in here are
these little they're stickers right once
this slay yes
slay all day not must lay that's funny
and just some cutesy little stickers so
I'm sure I'll use that in something
maybe in my planner so that was
everything in there that was a lot you
got the stickers the eyelashes put it
back in the box
the little tan self-tan thing the lips
lip gloss stuff these you a lip balm the
brush the highlighter duo pencil the eye
shadow the facial wipes and the candy
and the pin so that was a lot like I
almost should have saved this for last
because the other three come with much
less but of course price wise it is
different so keeping that in mind but
that was a lot in that box so and I feel
like a lot of it was kind of some fresh
stuff I haven't gotten before and then
some repeats in there but oh well I'm
honestly kind of impressed with that
let's open the fc-1 next this is $10 a
month look at the bag I was so giddy
when I opened it it's like this light
pearly pink but then it's got like
Halloween type things so there's like
black lipstick and a ghost and magic
potion and bats and fangs I love this
like this I ate my ate let me rephrase
this is my favorite bag I've gone from
Ipsy ever ever it is so cute so and even
the little zipper pull is like a little
ghost that is so cute
so the theme is black magic let's dive
in so the first thing I painted my nails
today I should have waited
is this Josh ik nail polish I've never
heard of this brand it's like a deep
purple but it's kind of got a blueshift
to it so it's a really nice shade and
it's at the Shady's called luxe looks
pretty good looks like it might need
like maybe more than one coat like this
polish I'm wearing today was it's one of
the Sally Hansen ones like they're $4.99
range and these you need one coat you're
good but this one looks like it might
need two coats which is fine next thing
in here is this pure Brazilian miracle
leave-in conditioner so it looks like
it's a spray which I've had bad luck
with leave-in conditioners that are in
spray form like it like the nozzle gets
all caught up so or gets all clogged up
so then I can't spray anymore after like
the four
few days so I end up having to just dump
it out of smells nice not too strong I
might give it a try but literally every
leaving industry I've had that spray
form clogs up every single one anywho
but I do like to use the leave-in
conditioner like on days where I'm in a
rush and I'm just killed my hair air-dry
that's what I'll do instead of like oils
because I noticed my hair does a little
bit better when it's air drying if it's
just like a spray leaving conditioner
just a little bit lighter I feel like
the next thing is a brand another brand
I've never heard of Cosmo holic it's got
a little mirror looks like a mini lip
maybe look gloss maybe it's a oh that's
so pretty this remind you know for one I
just opened
isn't that pretty it looks like a my dry
down well maybe to a matte actually
maybe it is more glossy but it's really
pretty I prefer a little bit glossy over
Matt anyway even though I'm wearing a
matte lipstick right now but it's just
another really pretty autumn shade does
it say that shade name nope turn next
one is this O's from the balm it's their
cabana boy blush now I have a bone to
pick because the bomb does this all the
time and they're so hold on I gotta take
my slippers off I'm getting sweaty the
balm products are amazing and if you go
on look at the right time when the bomb
is on there you can get the full sizes
of these for like ten dollars instead of
like twenty-something their products are
incredible but I hate that when they
give little trial things like this if
this if this were an eyeshadow okay like
they've given some of those but this is
a beautiful blush I am NOT going to
cover my cheek with this tiny eyeshadow
sized pan like I it would take me
forever to get my brush all swirled in
there it's a pretty color it's a nice
super pigmented blush but I mean come on
come on make it just a little bit bigger
so we can actually do something with it
it's great for swatching I can swatch it
but that's about it
alright next thing is this SIOC today
London fierce flicks liquid liner okay
well I can't open it and I just painted
my nails and I've even tried with my
teeth
and open this right now so hopefully
it's good I don't know but I love liquid
liner and I go through them really
quickly so that will definitely get used
by moi so that was not bad but again I'm
just low-key obsessive bag not even
low-key like high key next one Birchbox
let's uh try it
Oh so they went a different route
because everyone you know what's October
a lot of people are doing like spooky
stuff their theme it says our name this
month take a breather and slow way down
I like that says think masking while
moving marathoning or using a night
cream before getting a full night's rest
all of that sounds so good right now no
matter how you left on wine we're
bringing you rejuvenating products to
make the most of your you time so the
first thing in here this stuff okay this
is the second one I've gotten to this
this stuff is incredible it's kind of a
cult classic and it can be really
expensive in the States I know it's a
little bit cheaper elsewhere but it's
the embryo lease lay cream concentrate
so it's just like a really concentrated
thick moisturizer it's incredible it's
one of those things that it's been
around for a bit of time and people love
it so I'm excited to have another one of
these I need to just bite the bullet buy
the full size but we'll see if I keep
getting up in this small size that I'll
just keep using the small size out okert
okay next thing is from dr. Brandt and
it's their micro dermabrasion exfoliator
so it okay so it looks like it's the
size but you can tell it feels like it's
half-empty like it's way too light you
guys don't I mean so that is kind of
it's just filled with air boom but I'll
still try that of course next thing is
this I said next thing like 15 times
should have a next thing count it's the
number for high performance hair care
super comb prep and protect says leaving
conditioner okay another spray one again
I'll use it hopefully the nozzle is okay
can't really tell bad smell a little bit
of one but nothing too crazy so again I
will use it but hopefully it doesn't get
clogged up what else we've got this Mont
all Paris dark purple
Oh Department let's see about this yes I
do love one that not just like one that
you have to open it's got a little tiny
sprayer I like that I don't want to
spray it on myself I'm going to spray
like this my little washcloth here that
I'm using to wipe off swatches oh gosh
it all smells borderline like a men's
cologne but not in a bad way
it's and I wouldn't even call it musky
it's almost like this really deep and
maybe a little musky this deep woodsy
perfume and it has like this kind of
like shifts to it very I don't know it's
good that I don't hate it but I would
have to like try it out a few times just
to see how I feel but very intriguing
smell I can't say I've ever smelled a
perfume like that the next one is this
Marcel extension plus curl mascara I
like getting these just because honestly
these lasts me like the trial size
mascaras lasts me as long as the full
size one does before it starts getting
weird so doesn't like in my opinion I
don't think it really matters which full
size or not you're going to get about
three months use out of it regardless at
least in my experience which is great so
that was everything in the Birchbox it
is alright again I love the embryo lease
product so I'm really excited about that
the perfume is pretty intriguing the
rest of it you know take her leave
sorry not bad not bad the last one is
the boxy charm which is like twenty one
dollars a month and see what's ripped
the box when will I learn to get a box
cutter there we go alright oh this is
the it's a full size brioche EO rose
Arco blow-dry perfection he protected
cream I need one of these and in my
experience recently I've been just
trying out some brioche EO brioche EO
brioche you know I don't know how to say
it um I've been trying out some of the
products I really really like them so
I'm excited that this is a full size is
kind of crazy and this is here's the
thing I'm terrible about using heat
protectant and I know that's so bad but
for me like the kinds
use our sprays and I just all the time
to space race race race race race right
I'm that lazy and I'm in that much of a
rush but if it's a cream I'll really
quickly run it through and it's so much
faster so I will totally use this
that's like next in line it just bumps
some other things out of the way all
right
next thing is this temp to again these
are all full-size oh I'm getting excited
I just peeked it's their summer bronzer
now I know temp 2 is usually this is for
like a what do you call it like a spray
type of what is that called but I you
can squeeze it out so it's definitely
bronzer there it is right there
um it does kind of blend out nicely
though I mean like if you really do it
doesn't there are no like weird harsh
lines I would say so I feel like you
really could blend this out just with
maybe stippling brush or maybe a Beauty
Blender I don't know but it actually
kind of is a nice colored kind of orange
so it might be too orange for me I don't
know I'll have to try it but um
kind of intriguing the packaging reminds
me of like the little map liquid cream
liquid stuff they have let's see so this
one has the prices on the card so the
temptu thing
2950 oh yeah so this is not for their
like temp to spray thing this is just
meant to be used as it is okay so yeah
$30 for that the Brio geo Brio geo
product is $24 and this is the full-size
so so far you've already gotten your
money's worth times - let's keep going
um this is the it's another Luxy which
is the same brand as that brush we just
got but it looks like this is like a
little set this is so cute a little eye
set I do use a couple of my luck see eye
brushes I received I like those just a
little bit better than their face
brushes so this little it's their eye
blender brush pack and it's $36 so that
means each brush is essentially $12 I
think this is the brush I have that I
use this is kind of just like a perfect
crease brush the next one's just a
little bit thinner and then this one is
just a little bit shorter actually so
these are lovely lovely brushes
like um and I again they have that
pretty light pink handle with like the
kind of bronze ferrule so cute little
brush set that I like I'm in like a
twirly chair and I'm currently like
facing this way and I'm like turning
because I'm sitting cross-legged so it's
like just keeps moving there we go
alright next thing
boo boo I've never heard of sprint iby
beauty or idiy beauty it's their Three's
Company trio eyeshadow palette and this
retails for $19 for this and again it's
the full size so it's just this cute
little trio see ooh it's got three
pretty useful colors I mean very neutral
which I'm not mad about
it's got like a pearly white shimmery
gold and then a medium brown matte wow
wow wow wow oh I kind of flubbed the
matte Brown it's so early pigments that
I just didn't press hard enough I think
when I was actually swatching look at
those shimmery shades oh my gosh why
have I not heard of this brand before
that is insanity oh my gosh that's like
butter that gold shade I'm losing my
mind over so that's amazing we'll
definitely use that again maybe tomorrow
for work just to see how it works and
the last thing in here looks like it's
from Oprah and this is the Oprah
highlighter in Beverly Hills oh whoa
whoa I could have been bad I tell you
guys I broke my Becca highlighter I put
on snapchat about it but it was like
months ago and I'm still staring I
haven't fixed it yet because I'm just so
heartbroken I just need to fix it so
this is the Beverly Hills highlighter
and it's retails for $40 what are they
thinking $40 so it says gorgeous like
kind of color wheel you can see with
like a light pink gold a peach a lighter
gold and the white Wow it is crazy
though oh my gosh you can almost see the
different facets of each one in there
it's like those Unicorn Highlanders that
is gorgeous though you could wear that
on your eyes as well
$40 like with $40
I could buy a lot of things for that's
just especially for brendlin over where
their products are nice but they're not
that well known outside of YouTube I
don't think so that's a lot but it is
really nice so I'm not saying it's not
necessarily worth it I'm just saying
that's a lot that was amazing though so
I'm really excited about that and then
this was a really good one I'm not crazy
excited about the bronzer only because I
don't know shade wise if it'll be great
for me I'm gonna try it though but all
the rest of it like the little brush
pack the hair mask the highlighter and
the eye shadow I'm very very excited
about so I think if there were a winner
that might be it I don't know the beauty
calm is really nice too all of them are
really good but yeah anyway so hopefully
you enjoyed this hopefully you maybe
made a decision if you're wanting to buy
one of these for yourself or for someone
else as a gift or if you're just
watching for fun like I do sometimes
then hey thanks for joining me for the
fun other than that I hope that you'll
subscribe to catch more of my videos and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
