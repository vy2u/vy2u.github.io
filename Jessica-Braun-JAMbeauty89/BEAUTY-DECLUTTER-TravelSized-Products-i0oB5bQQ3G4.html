all cozy at home on the weekend and I
wanted to film a decluttr of my travel
toiletries because it's kind of gotten
out of hand
like to the point where I have it in
this like drawer which apparently I also
have foundation on and I can't even shut
the drawer in the little system I have
in my closet and that's just crazy we do
travel a lot because my husband is a
travel agent but we don't travel this
much this is crazy so I want to go
through and keep if it's you know more
than half gone and I think it's not even
gonna last a whole trip I'm just gonna
get rid of it pass it on to a sister if
they'll use that last bit up and if not
then I'm you can recycle it and then
other things that I just have no
interest in trying or maybe I just have
too many of then I will kind of give to
either my sisters or a women's shelter
so let's go and get started
also if you like declutter videos I do
this kind of stuff all the time I will
link my decluttering playlist down below
so what I'm going to get rid of I'm just
gonna put in this basket here and what
I'm going to keep I'll put in this here
I think I'm just gonna sort through this
stuff first because it's really hard to
go through it if it's not sorted and
said like categories alright let's start
with this is like SPF stuff this is a
whole thing of SPF and this is the
natural tinted SPF and this is one from
Kula I think I'm gonna get rid of the
coats one just because I don't really
use sorry about the shadows it's
nighttime it's nighttime guys oh I don't
really use this so I'm gonna pass that
one on it's brand new
I think this is like a bunch of little
SPF things or a bunch I mean like three
and I like the idea of this and I liked
it it's really small so I think I'm
gonna keep these SPF and pass on this
one as well
next let's do fragrance I've got this
Saint perfume from Kat Von D I've
already smelled this I don't like it I
actually had this separately and this is
a different one I was sent as a sample
I'm gonna pass it on well that's brand
new I have the Tom Ford orchid Soleil
the Suns whole 33 oh I actually like the
Tom Ford one so I'm gonna keep that one
but the Sun Sol 33 little tiny baby
sample I don't even know if I'm saying
that right to be quite candid
I just don't really care for it so I'm
gonna pass that one on this is my
favorite little travel perfume holder I
will link it below it's by travel and
you just kind of like pop off the top of
your perfume and just into it and it
works really well so I'm definitely
gonna keep that we're going to use that
most of the time the naked one I like
but it's remember 2k but I don't care
enough about I don't know so I think I'm
just gonna pass it on I've used it a
little bit
I think my sister Christy would like
this so I'm gonna pass that on to her so
that's not bad I'm so far keeping like
two perfumes and some SPF and I'm
getting rid of like five days awesome
these are some like makeup sample size
things and the only reason I keep these
in here is because for a while I would
only come here to pick some things out
but I think I might move these into my
makeup but before I do that like I love
the it cosmetics CC cream so I'm
definitely keeping that strobe cream and
this YSL primer but like these three I
never use so I'm just gonna pass them on
and I'll move these to my pickup trying
to make the lighting better it's really
difficult alright so I have this way
shampoo and conditioner I like this
stuff pretty well so I'm gonna keep it
because this is a perfect like weekend
trip thing to throw in my bag same goes
for this Garnier I don't love this but
it's just so perfect to throw in your
bag to have something and it takes up
virtually no room at all so I still like
to have these this is just a conditioner
oh that doesn't belong here
so I don't think I'm gonna keep it I
just don't think it's worth keeping this
is this clarifying shampoo this is a
shampoo and conditioner but it's really
old so I'm actually gonna toss these
I'll put it in yeah I'll just put it
over here um this is an air dry cream so
it's technically not a shampoo oh this
are in Co I'm just gonna pass on this
deep conditioning mask I like it but I
just don't foresee myself traveling with
it and I have plenty of mass for now so
I'm just gonna pass that on to someone
that might enjoy it
this however is an air drying cream and
I actually ever try my hair a lot
especially when I'm traveling so this is
perfect to keep so I've got three of my
favorite hair
grace like my ultimate favorite I always
travel with these I wish they were
almost smaller because they take up a
lot of room but this is the best
hairspray in the world
it's the bedhead masterpiece I will link
these below because it is so worth
checking out so I'm keeping all three
but I need to use them in order because
they I've used all three of them like an
idiot so now I'm like well I can't get
rid of any of them because all of them
are about half full so I need to use
these up but I don't want to use them up
at home I'm gonna save them for travel
oops I have this is it conditioner it's
oh it's shampoo I'm just gonna pass on
yet again another mask however I've
never tried this brand so I might just
put it in my shower right now and just
try it out
buy the brand PI Shou I'm not sure if I
pronounced that way so not necessarily
for travel I'm just gonna use it here at
home this is just about gone so I'm
gonna pass that on alright this is the
only like I just don't like this stuff
it's like a mousse for if I wear my hair
curly but I just don't like it so I'm
gonna pass it on it makes my hair sticky
and gross these are all shampoo no these
are all hair sprays Elnett is like a
cult classic for a reason I hate the
smell but it really does a good job so
I'm gonna keep this one this orb I once
just about gone so I'm gonna throw this
in my bathroom and just use it up and
then that's gonna be that then not your
mother's in the frizzies I've never used
but I see I already have like those
other three so I think I'll keep the
frizzies and pass on and not your
mother's not that there's anything wrong
with this but while it's still new I'll
pass it on so if something else can
enjoy it but hair spray is important I
do use it pretty much every day
this is way too much dry shampoo I
bought this last year as a set and I
think I'd intended to pass it on I don't
remember if I bought it with the
intention of giving it to someone or if
I just bought it for myself because I
love this and they were travel-size I
still want to keep it cuz by T shampoos
are amazing this one's just about gone
I'm trying to think of what I've
actually used this is a texture powder
I've used texture powders before it and
I just don't like them so I'm gonna pass
that one on this one's like half gone
the red kin so again I think I might
throw it in my bathroom and use it in
there and
and be done with it but these I've never
used the Amika and the iron coast I kind
of want to keep all of them is that like
way too many maybe but I usually travel
with the dry shampoo because I like to
have it and yeah I just like it all all
right next up are like little like
creams for your hair the way finishing
cream I want to use the Brio G oh gosh
this is almost gone so I think I'm just
gonna pass that on this is the Armco
moisture and shine cream I think I'll
keep and this is like a hair serum I
think I'm just not gonna put this in
travel because it's glass I'm just gonna
move it to like my regular hair serum
sure but I will keep these two alright
let's move on to body and then I have a
ton of skincare because that is kind of
my biggest concern when I'm traveling so
these are like either lotions or body
washes things like that I have this is
the only shave cream I have so I will
keep that it's the wish shave cream then
this is just old it's the body shop
vanilla chai body wash and I've just had
it for a little bit too long so I think
it's just time but this is the body shop
almond milk and honey body butter it
smells so good and I have a little bit
left of this Brazilian boom boom cream
as well so I'm gonna keep both of those
I don't think I'm ever going to use this
like exfoliating body scrub I'll pass
that on this I like to mix in with
moisturizer for like an extra glow when
I'm traveling it's the wheel protégée
or from nooks I love it so I'm keeping
both of these and that and then hand
food I feel like this should be like in
my nightstand so I'm gonna move that to
there the natural glow this doesn't
really need to be in my travel but it's
one of those like quick ones and I feel
like I wouldn't need it in real life but
if I were traveling I might so that's
why I keep it in there so just gonna
keep it in there for now and this
Vaseline stuff I think is pretty old
this is just an unopened contact
solution definitely keeping and then
these are nail polish remover pads I'm
also going to keep I have
like toothpaste but again I go through
these so I'll definitely keep both of
those and use those up I have like way
too many tissues and honestly I just
don't use them that much so I might take
some of these to school and then just
keep one in my travel tour extra
toothbrushes I don't really need for
this but I'm gonna move into just our
toothbrush drawer here look like I have
a whole tour I don't have a whole drawer
for that but we have like an extra Shore
for things like that and I think I'm
gonna throw those in there let's start
with makeup removers I think these are
all of my makeup removers I have some
wipes I'll get to I just don't use my
solar or micellar waters at all so I'm
just gonna pass all of these on they're
all brand new this is really all I use
it's a little bit it's the Clinique take
the day off
cleansing balm honestly I like clean
this out and refill it every time I
travel so like I'd use that up and then
refill it with either this Clinique
stuff or like my it cosmetics it's all
kind of the same so I just keep this jar
and reuse a lot so that's what I like
that's what I use
and by taking something like that I
don't have to worry about like bringing
cotton rounds or anything wit along with
this and this takes up a lot of room in
a liquids bag all right let's do face
washes and masks and things like that oh
these are eye makeup remover pads by all
made but these like ruin my eyes so I'm
just gonna pass those on all right so
I've just got random stuff here so
looking at it the cleansers that I would
probably actually use genuinely would
definitely be the Clinique one it's kind
of like needs to be mixed it looks like
but this is so pretty new then rinse off
foaming cleanser I know I would like and
use a lot of these are like masks like
I'm not gonna use this Marcel stuff
these clinics are these Kotal a mask I
really like these but again I don't
travel with masks and I've way too many
like full-sized masks to even keep these
I'd rather someone else use them that
will so I'm gonna pass both of these on
I don't really I'm kind of realizing I
don't love Dermalogica products like I
like some of their eye creams but I like
this stuff I've used before and I just
didn't like any of it so I'm just gonna
pass it all on this I'm excited to try
it
Korres Wild Rose advanced brightening
sleeping facial so I'm going to keep
both of these I think this dr. Brandt
when I'm gonna pass on this milk makeup
matcha cleanser is like a cleansing
bombs thing I do like this so I'm gonna
keep it for a little while longer but I
don't know how long this is gonna stay
good so if I don't use it within the
next honestly like year because I don't
think I see a thing on it
yeah there's no like amount of months on
the bottom if I don't use this in the
next like six to twelve months I'm gonna
pass it on again another Dermalogica
thing I'm gonna pass on so this is this
herbivore blue tansy clarity mask I'm
not going to use it pur Lisse blue lotus
seed mud mask and exfoliant maybe I'll
keep one mask what is this top two
Harper resurfacing resurfacing masks so
I think I'll keep the pur Lisse what if
I like for the one time I'd want to
travel with them you know what no see
I'm trying to make excuses I'm gonna
pass the pur Lisse went on I'm gonna
keep the top two Harper won put it my
bathroom to use it'll probably take one
or two uses and then it'll be gone but
I'm intrigued to try it cuz I've never
tried anything from that brand I'm
trying to not make excuses well I'll
keep it because you know Jessica
honestly if you've not used it yet
you're never ever gonna use it alright
so these are all like face creams eye
creams things like that some of these
are serums so I think the only serums I
have this cause one I've not used yet
I'm never gonna use just pass it on Jess
this Estee Lauder advanced night repair
is actually really really good
and I think it's about 1/3 gone so I'm
definitely gonna keep this and use it up
it's a really good serum whoa this is
just about gone I love the embryo lease
it's such a light it's like a deep
moisturizer but it's light so you can
use it at night you can use it in the
morning right before makeup so it's
ideal for travel it's just about gone
no phone it's just about gone so I kind
of feel like travel wise I wouldn't
travel with it because I'd probably run
out before and I don't want to bring two
things so I'm gonna go ahead and put
this in my bathroom to just finish up is
this serum by Juice Beauty I'm just
gonna pass on I don't really need it
I had like they send me like five of
these this Luzerne detox mask
oh so that's a mask I think I'm just
gonna pass these on this is a Estee
Lauder I serum these are both like I
moisturize errs I think I had another
one this origins ginseng eye cream the
Kiehl's ones just about gone Lancome I
think I'm using I think all I really
liked the Kiehl's midnight recovery eye
maybe I might put the Kiehl's one in my
bathroom to use up and keep I like all
three of these so I'm gonna keep all
three honestly alright moving on I think
all of these are creams now sorry your
seem like mostly me oh this is for body
this is ultra Repair Cream by first day
beauty and I do like that moisturizer
something to keep it all right I have
two of these confidence in a creams I do
like them but I certainly don't need
both so I'm gonna pass the brand new one
on
I like the Clinique I love the Codel II
one I have two of the clinic so I'm
gonna pass on I'm gonna pass on this one
this is the Kiehl's ultra facial cream
I'm definitely gonna keep the belief one
I want to try set it fill I'm gonna go
ahead and pass on yeah I think I'm gonna
keep is it bad to keep all of these face
creams I fly through like when I travel
I really do fly through these so I think
I'm just gonna keep all of them that's
not too bad let's see okay next up is
all I have like a weirdly high amount of
like wipes and I what I need my wife
says they're either eye makeup remover
wipes which are really quick to use but
honestly I feel like I just don't use
them I'm now like I've kept them cuz I'm
a gold we'll just in case but I always
use like the cream stuff like I showed
you
so part of me is like do I really need
them like any of them RMS beauty these
left fresh ones I think I'm gonna put
these in my drawer with my other makeup
wipes which I only use for swatches and
I'll just use these up same with you
Olay so those are all gonna go in that
drawer to use up this glow tonic to go I
just didn't love glow tonic so I'm gonna
pass those on this is this
Arnel as leo white marble translucent
scream I mean I guess I might as well
I'm not going to use it just pop them
and then this I actually just recently
got there all these different it's from
this savvy traveler brand and there are
like two of all these different wipes so
there's a surface wipe a lens and screen
wipe all-in-one facial white nail polish
remover wipe deodorant white I like that
teeth lip and mouth cleansing wipe a
booty wipe that's what it says and a
hand and body wipes so I think I want to
keep all these the only one I'm going to
move is maybe the facial wipe I'm going
to move with those other ones but the
rest of these like depending on what I'm
traveling for they genuinely would
probably be used like I love the
deodorant wipe and the nail polish so I
will keep these and I might as well keep
them in this cute little bag just to
rank them and then all of you so these
are really the only wipes I'm keeping
right and all the rest I'm putting in
that drawer and some I got it so these
are all like random things I have this
is like a makeup remover thing I never
use I'm just gonna pass on this is equip
I love my equip toothbrush but I never
use the stand or holder when I travel so
I'm just gonna get rid of it Vaseline I
like to have because sometimes I'll
throw it on my lips I know it's not
necessarily like for healing lips but I
still use it and so I always like to
have one on hand so I think however I
might learn move this to like our
first-aid area I don't think I
necessarily need it my travel so I'll
move it there Vaseline is good for so
many random things I feel like even for
like I had to get my ring resized cuz
like I guess my fingers got fatter and
that helped
with that too which is nice this I used
to use to like connect my bag to like my
other bag like my luggage and I think
I'm still gonna keep it because I've
used it decently recently the brand
Tilly recently the brand is clip I can
link it below it's actually really good
for that
these are random container I'm gonna be
honest I don't even know what's in these
but actually I think I do I think this
is a curl cream yeah definitely
that's a curling cream this might be a
natural blue lotion and this is an
exploiter but I like to have these
containers for if I need them so even if
I just emptied it out cleaned it out and
used it
they're great travel containers so I
will keep closed I'm gonna get rid of
this I was keeping it in case I want it
for jewelry well guess what I never have
just extra contact lens case things this
is all hair stuff so I like to just keep
it wrangled just ready to go for travel
there's bobby pins hair ties things like
that in here and I can just throw it in
my bag
and I know that I've got plenty of hair
ties and bobby pins for the whole trip
so in the end this is all about getting
rid of like this whole big thing filled
so for some of it I haven't really
sorted some of it is just gonna be
recycled like this body wash is just
about gone actually you know what I
might put this in our shower to use up
just because I did love the smell of it
but anyway that aside it's all either
you know some of it will go to class
with me all that sisters go through it
it's brand new I might take it to a
women's shelter if I get a bunch of
stuff together things like that but
that's a lot of stuff that was just
sitting in that drawer that was never
ever going to get used it's really sad
and of course some of it is just garbage
recycling and this is what I'm keeping
so I feel like yeah I mean this is
probably more than I'll use in the next
year or two we'll see but it's certainly
a lot easier to kind of comb through and
I have like half of the room from like
vertically that I have before so it's
gonna be really easy to close the other
things I like to throw in here is my
travel mirror I got it on HauteLook I
can link below I don't I haven't seen it
on there though in a while but it's like
sits tabletop but then it's protected
when it's packed and then I also throw
in my TSA clear bag I can fit like weigh
like a ton of this I'll link the closest
thing I can find to this on Amazon down
below because that's where I bought it I
mean it looks like I need to clean it
out but this
is just an amazing back but it all fits
this is so nice
so hopefully you enjoyed the video if
you did definitely subscribe and I'll
see you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
