a collab video with my friend Kirsten I
remember her watching her videos way
before I had ever started a channel and
let's see I think I discovered her
through shades of Cassie and I watched a
video of Kirsten's and I was like this
girl is a kook and I love her she's so
goofy and silly but yet totally real and
down-to-earth and like super honest and
it's just lovely and it's so rare here
on YouTube to find people like that so I
think that's why I just latched on to
her and I was like I love this woman she
has done this video before and it's
called four or more and it's basically
where you feature makeup products that
you have bought four or more of of
course the idea being that if you've
bought four of something then you must
really really like that product not just
for a certain shade but specifically
because of the formula or the way it
wears or whatever it is it's clearly a
product that you really really love so I
was going through my collection I
thought I don't think I have that many
things where I have four more of and I
want a surprise now some of this stuff I
bought with my own money some was sent
to me from friends so and you'll see
especially for a lot of the lip products
a lot of it was sent to me from friends
which is why I have more than four of
them however they're ones that I think
even if they hadn't been sent to me I
would have eventually bought more than
four because I love them so let's go and
get started let's start with brushes
because that was when I almost forgot to
mention I thought I should mention this
so first of all the elf
Studio line of brushes I own one two
three four five six of I might own more
but these are the first ones I found
that were actually on my vanity that I'm
using everyday so the elf small tapered
brush I use all the time for
highlighting because it's just a really
nice brush and these are all three
dollars the elf complexion brush I love
using for blush because of the shape
it's a little bit flatter and then oh I
just love it and then it fans out I
actually used it today for blush then
the simple brushes they have this small
and the regular stipple brush these are
so awesome for cream bronzer
like for contouring and cream blush and
that's exactly what I use them for you
can kind of tell I need to wash them but
again these are fantastic stippling
brushes and then also the flawless
concealer brush I used to set my under
eye with powder when I do that I always
use this one and then I also use this
small smudge brush for cream liner every
single day I use this all the time and
actually I repurchase this one a few
times because I lose these all the time
these are fantastic and if anyone were
ever asking what brushes I would
recommend if you're on a budget these
cuz they are even if you're not on a
budget they're so good
then I would also in the realm of ELF
they're essential line which is their
dollar line their brushes I love their
eye brushes I've tried a few of the face
brushes and I'm not I didn't love them
and I haven't tried all of their face
brushes but their eyebrows are great I
really love the what is this one called
the blending eye brush I use that for
the crease almost every single day this
I use for the outer corner it's their
defining eye brush and then oh I have
two of those oh that's right that's how
much I love that one and then the smudge
eye sponge I don't use this every day
but it's great if you've got shadow it
literally is a sponge and you can just
kind of smudge it underneath or if
you've lined your under eye and you want
to smudge it out or any part of your eye
you can use this and it's a great tool
and those are only $1 so I love those
and then lastly for brushes are the
Sigma one and I mentioned them and I
wasn't gonna because I know a lot of you
guys are like they're so expensive and
that's why sometimes I hesitate to
mention them but they're worth
mentioning because they really are good
for foundation and that's basically if
you see I own five brushes and four of
them are for you know foundation II type
products and that's what I use them for
well we're in the realm of you know
powders like blushes and stuff I really
do use my ELF ones for that but this one
which needs to be clean is one of my
favorites the tapered kabuki is the balm
for blending out concealer oh my gosh
and every day that I use it I'm like oh
my gosh like it's so flawless there's no
weird Krusty's there's no it doesn't
blend it so it's completely gone it is
amazing so that's how I achieve
like a full-coverage concealer look it's
this brush I'm telling you it's so
amazing and then I also love this is the
f80 which I like for Foundation and I
also like the f80 too it kind of depends
on the foundation which one I like to
use for and then the angled kabuki f-84
I haven't used as much lately but this
is also good for Foundation and then
this is their precision round brush it's
a smaller one great again for concealing
especially for spot concealing okay
enough about brushes Jess that's enough
so I got to get these out of the way I'm
gonna run out of space on my little
table here so in the realm of lip
products I have recently been branching
out to brighter colors and you'll see
that in these collections because I have
a pretty wide range one of the things
I'm going to mention I'm just stuck in
here to store them while they're on the
table these aren't the maybelline color
whispers and these I bought a few myself
and then my friend amber sent me a lot
of these and the one that I bought
myself I think was lust for blush
although I'm pretty sure I've had two of
these so she might have sent me one as
well this one is it's the most perfect
natural everyday color is it not are you
kidding me it's perfect you can use it
without a mirror and yet your lips just
look healthy they really look so healthy
with all of these color whispers and I
think that's what I love so much about
them and then they have like brighter
colors there's um who wore it redder and
pin-up peach this is who wore it redder
isn't that beautiful it's kind of like a
pinkish red which i think is just one of
my favorite shades when it comes to
lipstick especially when I want
something more punchy stryker Rose is
another favorite that one I'm gonna put
it next to lust for blush this is um
what did I just say this is called this
is strike a rose and that's less for
blush those are my two favorite I think
in the entire line just because they're
so wearable and useful for everyday I
also have a la lilac which is very it's
a light color but it's certainly a very
cool tone bluish pink you know so you
kind of got to think about your skin
tone and whether it would Li look good
or not with your skin tone I'm not sure
how I feel about this one with my skin
tone to be honest so I really don't wear
it very often this is coral ambition and
that is petal rebel there another light
pinkish one coral
missions beautiful I can't wait to wear
that it's technically spring now but it
doesn't feel like you're but regardless
and I swatch all of them I'll go ahead
and swatch pinup peach because that's
another favorite of mine
that's pinup peach so it's a little
darker than coral ambition you can see
but they're both kind of peachy coral II
toned so wow that's a lot of swatch 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 I am 7 of those and I have 7
swatches yeah I did it so I really if
you're looking for something that's just
a great addition to your purse cuz these
are my favorite things to carry around
with me because while I might not use
them necessarily always like for videos
when I want a more brighter lip these
are the most perfect makeup items for
everyday oh man ok move on move on ok
more lips so I have fallen in love with
the Rimmel showoff lip lacquers and I
have four of them two of these I
purchased myself and two were sent to me
in a Influenster box like I want a
Rimmel badge or something like that so
I'll go ahead and show these to you so
these are the swatches their celestial
Nova apocalyptic and BIGBANG they're
just beautiful I see that those two and
those two kind of look similar to each
other but they are different tones
certainly gorgeous they're very they
really a lip lacquer that's exactly what
they are they're very pigmented they're
very kind of juicy and glossy they dry
too a little bit less of a glossy finish
I think on my lips at least they do but
I think they're beautiful they do have a
smell to them so that's something to
keep in mind but I love them mostly for
the color payoff that's the main thing I
think they wear off pretty well
throughout the day too so I just think
they're gorgeous and my favorite way to
use these if not alone is over another
lipstick so it just really adds that
punch to it the next lip product that I
have four more of is the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stains now I have
two from their original line which this
there is let's see cherish and honey
cherish is a more recent purchase for me
it's a very it almost doesn't even show
up on my skin it's a very light blue
toned pink and then there's honey which
is one of my favorites so there is
cherish and there is honey these are
great because they really
do stain your lips they stay on for so
long even after the kind of like glossy
not glossy but shiny finish is gone
there the color is there and it's so
nice then two of their lacquer bombs
which this one is in whimsical and this
one the lacquer bombs are shiny
basically that's the main point they
also have matte bombs I will own any of
those this one's in demure
okay so there's demure and there is
whimsical whimsical actually has glitter
no both actually have glitter in them
which really is a letdown because as the
color is off these don't stain the same
way that the original ones do so as the
color wears off the glitter is left
behind so that really is a letdown
because I love those two colors but I
find myself not reaching for these as
often as I reach for these just because
of that glitter so I also have a lot of
these Sonia Kashuk
lipsticks and what I'm wearing on my
lips today is one of these so I have
exactly four of them I love you can
probably hear the packaging scratching
hold on let me see if I can there we go
I love these my friend amber actually
sent me these so I had I did not buy
these with my own money however I am
constantly looking at these and thinking
about buying even more because I reach
for these all the time so the colors I
have are let me swatch these nude pink
which is this kind of nude pink color
right and then there's also blushing
which is another nudie color but it's
even more pink toned that's new that's
nude pink this is blushing so they are
for nude colors they are still a little
bit darker more pigmented or I know I
guess I should say deeper
this one's rosette which is what I'm
wearing on my lips right now right there
and I'm wearing it right now looks yeah
that actually does match pretty well and
then the last one I have is classic red
now this one Oh perfect you can actually
see I'm not sure if you're going to be
able to see there's a little skx net
kainalu way tomforde lipsticks are in it
when you originally get it
there's the SK for Sonia Kashuk edged
into the lipstick it's so cute so this
one I haven't clearly haven't worn as
much I love this because it is a blue
toned red look how
beautiful that is I think I'm gonna pull
this sucker out and wear it more often
maybe I'll wear in my next video
because it really is absolutely gorgeous
what I love about these lipsticks is
that they're so moisturizing when you
put them on it just feels so good it's
like the payment paid off of a really
really like matte and super saturated
lipstick but it has a little bit of
moisture to it and I guess it's not
matte so I don't know why I said that
but it's it's not too far from being
matte I love these lipsticks and they
kind of smell like one that smells like
a baby why because I was just yeah they
have a slight vanilla scent to them
they're just absolutely fantastic I love
these so if you see them and you see
that there's a coupon on target.com for
Sonia Kashuk try one I swear you won't
be disappointed I love them so the I
think this is the last lip product that
I'm gonna mention are the Revlon lip
butters and these would they there's
such a hoop law when these first came
out like what a year two years ago
whatever it was and I own six currently
I've given some away because I had so
many and some of them are colors I've
never wear I gave some to my sisters but
I have six so this is what they look
like if you don't know they're adorable
so let me show you these real quick
before I forget what they are this one's
peach parfait which is one of my
favorites but it does have a little bit
of glitter in it so again but it's the
prettiest shade I love the way it looks
on my lips and I have owned like I think
three of these I fly through peach
parfait then there is why can't I
remember these sweet tart which is a
nice pink shade and then wild watermelon
and then here I've got very smoothie
which is my one of my favorite fall lip
colors sorbet which is a brighter pink
and then what was this last one called
juicy papaya which is such a fun coral
color for spring oh I'm making a mess
though so these are just super
moisturizing nice I would say a nice
color payoff but they are a little more
sheer so you can kind of work with them
and that means of course too since they
are a little more sheer they're gonna
look different on everyone depending on
natural lip pigmentation so it's another
thing to keep in mind I love the way I
think my two favorite if I had to pick
your favorite our peach parfait and
berry smoothie peach parfait is my
favorite like all year round especially
spring and summer and the berry smoothie
I love in the fall in winter so I love
these too but I love all of them alright
moving on from lips wow that was a lot
of lip alright so blush
the only blush that I own more than four
of our the tart what do they even call a
see they're the Amazonian clay 12-hour
blushes I own four I own three full-size
in one like trial size this was the
first one I got and a lot of times you
can see these I got this with their
bronzer the Park Avenue princess bronzer
which I actually used today that's one
of my favorite in a set for like fifteen
dollars total for both of them and even
though it's mini it's more blush than
you're gonna use I mean it's gonna take
you a while to use this up even still so
this one is in the shade Dollface and
these are so just like icy I don't think
these are gonna swatch very well to be
honest they might I got like traces of
lipstick left over that's Dollface there
this beautiful light pink it's just so
innocent and fresh and that's why I fell
in love with it in the first place so
then today on my cheeks I'm wearing
exposed and that is a cult classic and
when I first bought it cuz I was like I
just gotta try it I'm dying to know what
it's like when I first bought it I was
like okay what is you know what this
one's not swatching well so just look at
it on my cheeks when I first bought it I
thought why it seems like such a boring
color except for I think it almost
transforms itself depending on your skin
tone to being the perfect just kind of
neutral shade it just looks good all
year round with any eye look you don't
even have to think about it you just put
it on and it always looks good and the
thing about these blushes is they last
all day so the next one is blushing
bride and this is a really deep and it
has gold flecks of sparkle in it I will
swatch this one I'm gonna swatch these
swatches ridiculous look at that one
it's just a beautiful kind of berry wine
color but it does have golden flecks so
that's another thing to keep in mind if
you know you're not gonna like that but
I've never noticed
that it looks weird or glittery and it
wears off fine throughout that it
doesn't even wear off they're out the
day honestly these really do stay on all
day and then charisma and this is what I
haven't reached for as often I think it
for me it's almost too warm of a color
for my skin tone there it is
it's a beautiful color though and I need
to maybe I'll try and pull these out in
spring in summer and make myself wear
this whole I don't know why I haven't
reached for it as often as the other
ones so they're all like I said they're
expensive but a lot of times tart will
have on its website like 30% off every
few months and I try and post it on my
Instagram when they're sales like that I
almost always post it on there so you
guys know because that's usually how I
find out about them from people I'm
following on Instagram so that's how I
got these and I got a really good deal
on them because it was like 30% off and
I think I also had another coupon code
or free shipping or something so I love
these blushes they're worth every penny
so moving on to eyes I think the rest of
this is all eyes and then there's some
nails to talk about this is gonna be a
very long video I'm so sorry alright so
for eyes I own four of these color
tattoos now my fourth one I can't find I
have which one of my missing I've got oh
bold gold I don't know where what I did
with that one
so anyway I've got toughest taupe which
is this exactly taupe color it's
completely matte completely matte is a
beautiful crease shade and and what I
liked about it is it's like a deeper
taupe it's it's darker than you would
think it would be look at that and the
color payoff is literally unbelievable I
mean that is just like a bite but moving
on we've got I got bad to the bronze
which is this beautiful bronzy shade but
the thing is as they start drying up and
I I never know how to storm because I've
heard you just turn him upside down and
I tried that and they still kind of dry
it out so I think now I'm there just
like however they end up when I throw
them back in there because I think I've
got this one room like whatever if I
have to buy a new one then fine because
they do dry up and I just bought my
first Mac Paint Pot and I got it in what
is the shade bear study and this one
which is in barely Brandon is like
it is an exact tube I mean they are look
at that though it's just gorgeous now
this is the second one I bought of this
one because my first one did dry out
pretty quick so that's another thing to
keep in mind the piece I almost think
you should instead of buying a bunch at
the same time buy one or two that you
know you're gonna use all the time
because if you buy a bunch and then you
don't use them they're just gonna dry
out but I can't get over how gorgeous
that is I use it all the time as my base
instead of a prime or anything because
it's beautiful especially if you want a
shimmery eye and my fourth poem is bold
gold which I don't know where it is but
it's just a beautiful gold shade and
that's it
I think after barely branded the bold
gold one is my favorite
okay so L'Oreal I have six of their
infallible shadows and a lot of people
have sent me these which is why I have
so many however they're gorgeous so my
original pranksta was iced latte and
this is I swear to you a dupe for sila
kitten I've done them side by side and I
should have I should do a video on some
dupes because clearly I'm keep talking
about I'm gonna do this right here it's
kind of next to the one I just did but
where is it I'm so pale that's it right
there isn't that totally steel kitten
it's so beautiful
I'll do a dupes video soon but I love it
and they basically come in these little
containers where there's a little
stopper and they're in there and usually
it's pressed down more than that is but
so they are a loose eyeshadow did I even
mention that they're the infallible
yakatori now another one I have is
endless pearl and it's this essentially
just tan or I should say beige color and
this one is a little bit of a pearl
finish but it's mostly just yeah it's
not even showing up on my skin but I'll
just show it to you in here it's mostly
just a matte color there's a little bit
of a pearl finish but I would say it's
almost matte but it's a beautiful lid
color if you're looking for one and then
another favorite is this eternal
sunshine which is a beautiful golden
color it looks great paired with bold
gold actually but my gosh I love this
one see now I'm seeing this some white I
haven't worn this a long time where is
it
where'd you go there it is isn't that
gorgeous it reminds me of half baked
side note I'm trying to get the
are these the color tattoos off and they
won't come off that's a good sign though
I mean this is there they go taking some
scrubbing so that's good to know though
you know if you put them on they're not
coming off throughout the day so I also
have this really deep
it's called bottomless Java and it's
this beautiful deep brown I don't wear
this one as often cuz you guys know me I
don't really wear deep deep colors all
too often I do wear them sometimes but
not all the time
that's bottomless Java and then I also
have amber brush which you guys when I
had originally started talking about
these months ago no longer than that ago
you guys were like oh my gosh you have
to get amber brush you have to get in a
rush and whoa look how beautiful kind of
runs me of rubenesque from Mac but it's
not a cream of course it's a loose
shadow but these are beautiful and
they're not loose in the fact that when
you put them on they're gonna like end
up all over here they really they're
this really is an amazing formula these
are absolutely stunning and they don't
get all over your face and the last one
I have my friend I think Karen you sent
me this right the liquid diamond oh it's
so beautiful they have the most
beautiful shimmery shapes look at that
it's just beautiful metallic silver
color but it's almost got flecks of like
deeper tones it's so gorgeous so love
those they're not too expensive at all
especially now that they've been out for
a while especially if you can find sales
or coupons which you know I'm always
doing duh okay what else all right
a few more things I started as Benny
almost so long and I again I'm thinking
lower on to my bed as usual where's she
going set up Jess okay so another thing
where I can't find the fourth one up
it's my Jordana liquid liners now I've
got three here and I also had the purple
one oh you know what I remember I gave
that I gave it someone but it's the
Geordi and a twelve-hour made to last
pencils I've done a review video on this
but this one is in aqua stone and what I
love about these is tuned they're like
two dollars and they are so pigmented
they do not budge they don't smudge a
lot of you guys have bought them on my
record
and have loved them and I'm so glad so
the green one they're exchanged jeweled
the black one is like black point I
think and the blue one is aqua stone
these are stunning and they really are
like three dollars at Walgreens it's
insane and the purple one I don't I
think it was called purple fixed it was
just a beautiful deep purple so I would
recommend these till the end of time I
love love love love love love love them
they're absolutely the same thing as the
Knicks slide on pencils which are like
nine dollars or I don't really know how
much those are or the Urban Decay 24/7
these are the same exact thing exactly
and they're like three dollars love them
and then also some eyeshadows I have
these all in the Mac palette and you
guys are constantly asking me what is in
here so I have some elf and some well
let me show you this right here the shed
hmm no these shadows here are from a
benefit kit so I'm not gonna mention
those now this one up here is an elf one
and it's called pink ice and it's this
beautiful creamy beige color then I've
also got down here an elf color sage
which is this green one which is
stunning on the outer corner or crease
this one here is one of my original
favorites which is wheat and it's like a
shimmery taupe color and then I've also
got no I'm sorry the shimmery taupe
color is called taupe and then this one
is wheat and it's like this beautiful
gold do you guys see that on my pinky
it's so beautiful and then the only
other elf one I've got is called which
one is it's this one and it's called
driftwood isn't that beautiful
a beautiful shimmery bronze now the Mac
ones I have in here I have one too I'd
only have three but although I'd mention
them since I've got this palette out and
a lot of people ask me so I've got this
one here which is this beautiful pale
gold called rice paper it's my favorite
lid color my friend amber sent me that
one and then I got omega oops I just got
it wet which is this taupe color a lot
of people use this on their brows that's
why I bought it and then I did not like
it in my brows at all it looked terrible
on mine
and then the last one I have is called
sable and it's this one here it's just
another beautiful bronze sable and
driftwood are very similar I'm gonna
hold them side by side so you can see
that yeah
one is the elf driftwood and this one's
max able max tables a little more
broadly I would say but they're both
beautiful
yeah the swatches are different that one
is max Abel and that one's driftwood so
they are different but they look similar
in the pan anyway so those are that's
what's in here I know a lot of you guys
have asked about that and uh now you
know so last thing I'm going to cover
are my nail polishes that I have a lot
of I hold on my nail polish in a spice
rack that I got from the Container Store
so let's see the ones that I form work I
have a ton of Essie polishes and I'm not
gonna mention all of them my again
threatening him/her sent me a lot of the
ones that I own but I have bought a lot
on my own as well but some of my
favorites I don't even know if they sell
this where I need to shake a lot of
these up this one's called yoga like
yoga with another gut at the end and
it's the most beautiful beige color for
your nails they don't look dirty when
you wear it and I don't know what it is
about this but I love it and then
there's a lot of the classics like mint
candy apple bikini so teeny that I love
but then some other ones that I really
like are big spender which is this
beautiful look at that color that's one
that I reach for a lot and then also
tart deco is this beautiful peachy color
see if there's any other ones oh and I
also wanted to mention dive bar which is
my first Essie polish I ever bought
which is this gorgeous color I love this
one in the wintertime so then I also
have a lot of these salon manicure ones
from Sally Hansen this is one of my
favorite formulas Essie I like their
color range but the formulas not my
favorite whereas these I genuinely love
the formula and the brush it is a bigger
brushless if you don't like that you
might not like these but this is
commander and chic which is such a great
color this one is black and blue guilty
party is one of my absolute favorites Oh
there's so many that I love and the
formulas these are just amazing this one
I like to wear on my toenails a lot
temptation just a fun bright color and
then they also have great glitters this
one's Golden Rule and this one's copper
penny and these glitters are so like you
don't it doesn't end up spotty you know
some glitters it's like there's a lot of
glitter in one part of the nail and not
on the other these are just beautiful
when you just one sweep and it's just
covered in glitter I love them another
one that I have more than four up are
these OPI ones and I actually don't have
many of these and I like this formula
better than se but this is Japanese rose
garden which is one of my favorites it's
just the perfect nice pink color on your
nails this one is short story which is
so fun I love this one in the summertime
and then another favorite of mine in the
winter is Miami Beach B eet I think I
ended up wearing this one we went to
Miami last summer my boyfriend and I or
last October actually I I just think
this is such a pretty color and the
other one I have I have a lot of the
Minnie Mouse collection which I'm
wearing on my toes right now one of the
Minnie Mouse ones but they're real tiny
and they're over there but then this one
is tickle my Francey it's just a really
pretty beige or tan what color it's like
taupe I don't know whatever this color
is and I think that's all that I have
like four of everything else I've only
got a few you know a sprinkling here
there but I love those one that I this
isn't part of this video but whatever I
have fallen in love with this soya
polish in dot which I got in I don't
know what do we get it in ladies a lot
of you guys got it too in the IPPS e bag
or something
this stayed on like for a whole week it
was crazy and I put it on with the same
base coat and top coat I always use and
this stay on for a week it was like
unbelievable with no chipping I was like
what
so I want to get more so a of polishes
cuz I was like Zoe you have nailed it
and I know that pink so foxy here on
YouTube loves like only by Zoya polishes
and now I'm assuming that as why because
oh my gosh so I might be paint my nails
with that here in a bit anyway so if you
lasted that long again I know I say this
at the end of every long video of us
seriously I can't believe you laughs
that was a very long video but I hope it
was some kind of eye opening for you so
you could see kind of what products I
really genuinely do love and I go back
to time and time again
because they are so good that I want
more shades I hope that you'll also
sorry I'm trying to clean off swatches
again those those Jordana liners I'm
scrubbing to get them off this is
awesome
anyway but I hope that you'll go check
out Kirsten's video I can't wait to see
it and definitely check her channel out
because she is absolutely one of my
favorites that I she's one of those
people I watch every video she puts up I
just love her and I love her personality
