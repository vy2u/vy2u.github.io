this is what you guys usually see but
what you don't see let me show you so
this is what you don't see so I have my
computer here to be able to look things
up I've got all kinds of piles of
products for different videos and I
usually have a mess of like trash from
opening things and different things to
clean up swatches things like that and
of course my setup there we are
hi guys there's my camera my little
microphone on top and my ring light and
then I've got two of these kind of soft
box type lights there so that's kind of
the way I set it up I end up just
shutting our blinds typically so I can
just use this light here but I feel like
if you follow me on snapchat you guys
get to see that kind of stuff all the
time but if you don't follow me there
you don't get to see it as much so
definitely follow me there but I wanted
to show you guys here on YouTube because
I feel like I never ever get to show you
guys also I just got a thread up package
in the mail and I'm really excited to
dig in they're actually sponsoring this
video and I'm really excited because
this is the first time I'm trying them
out so I kind of wanted to show you guys
what it's all about and kind of what you
can expect and if it's worth your time
let's go see what's in the package also
I might need to Tyler I might need your
help for this okay I had to comment to
your Tyler's help because I couldn't
hold it like this I wanted to show you
guys so I just decided to go to a
shopping it was very much like you could
see the original price and what it is
now and I'm like oh my god and it was a
lot of like really expensive brands so
this is cute packaging they have I
presume this is like your order slips
and stuff and you can you a 14 days if
you want to return them which that is
nice that's really nice didn't you try
it on it doesn't fit like the thing
about online shopping so it's nice that
they offer that so this is so cute this
is just adorable
looks like little eyes one of the things
that you almost don't want to like ruin
it oh my gosh I'm so excited about the
things I picked up okay so this first
thing I pictured using like like it's
kind of like a tunic link I might try
this one on here in a little bit but I
just thought was so cute and flowing it
look really cute actually of a cubed
leggings but meant
and like a blazer or like a cardigan
when you make an appeal hmm
so that one is really cute I'm excited
to try it on and then the next thing was
this the Lululemon thing I was
struggling because I wanted everything
from Lululemon Beach literally all seen
like the radio but they're so expensive
so yeah this is a Lululemon just a nice
plain black one but Lululemon is so
amazing but I own like one or two things
from there because it's so expensive so
now I'm like okay now I can own way more
because it's so much cheaper so this oh
my gosh I'm so excited about that these
literally seemed like brand-new I don't
see anything wrong with any of these
this I bought because I love like like
what I'm wearing today just like
leggings and a white t-shirt I love that
and this one is by made well and again
meatloaves expensive so I own like one
or two shirts in there but now I feel
like I can only way more these this
literally seems like brand-new okay so
this one for example has the tag still
on it this is brand new and so I'll put
on the screen how much I actually got it
for and how much it originally was but
so cute it's one of the simple shirts
you can put like a crazy necklace with
new facilities number line mate yes
that's made well this one I was excited
about for like something formal so this
is Calvin Klein literally has the Calvin
Klein tags and everything's still on it
but it is this thread up little tags are
so cute but it's like a size two so it's
exactly my size drag something to lounge
around the house in just a lounge wear
but I'm excited to try this one on too
because I love red I think red looks
nice on me and I need to something like
grown-up but still beautiful and not
like matronly or anything on me so I'm
so excited
again like brand new and then the last
thing I picked out was there's one under
a lunch box
and so actually Tyler's mom has the kind
of minnows to use it for much but did
kind of a beer Bradley tote and I think
it's so cute but this is one of my
favorite beer Bradley patterns and this
is literally brand new like they're
literally I don't think it's ever been
used so it's I got it for so much
cheaper than a
their beer Bradley and I have this
pattern in like a travel thing so I did
full price for those way more so I was
so excited this is brand-new and way way
cheaper new cute I don't even think it's
meant to be used as a lunchbox but that
is how I will be using I'm very excited
so I'm going to go pick some things to
try also they did give me a 40% off code
it's a jam for tea I'll put it on the
screen too but if you're wanting to try
it out 40% off 40% offices I mean that's
like half off that's awesome and it's
already so much cheaper so it's
definitely worth checking out but I will
put all that info below if you're
interested so this is that first one
into this cube it's like so comfy so if
I'm like bloated that day like no one
though but I didn't excute with leggings
in life you can put boots with it or
whatever and honestly like right now
it's winter so I probably felt like a
cardigan but I did so come in it's
literally renew what is good my system
is so this is just like the shirt I'm
sorry but I like this okay just a little
bit more like off-white and I just love
Madewell shirts but again it looks fine
with leggings like lounge around the
house would you say over and actually it
looks actually kind of cute with this
joker Tyler said I look like would you
say one of the Kardashians but the
younger ones Thank You Kendall and Kylie
yeah let's which one it's like I don't
know what the one that you look like
that's but thank you difference no feel
what you think and also what they're not
cardassia's what are they generous
generous you know if you like it did you
make it hmm don't want to get that close
the movement
I love dogs I guess PMS yeah we went
here very interested that time to
chitinous oh good about that think about
happiest and then you get kisses here go
boy
if I'm thankful by see right now what do
you need to do today charlie we need to
go grocery shopping book book at you I
gotta finish filming yeah you are making
you come near the office so I got a lot
of work
the math you guys have seen it I can
show you guys some more behind the
scenes oh wow like vh1 what was that
behind the music yeah yeah but today I
tried out the milk blur stick and I did
a video about is it worth it and I'm not
going to I'm going to try not to spoil
it but I really liked this stuff and
there may or may not be a giveaway of
involved but yeah I started to put a
towel down in front of me like because I
get so messy you if you've seen a past
video where I was showing the cover FX
custom cover drops and I want to just
use a shade that I wear and I literally
just poured the thing out trying to look
at the shade on the bottom I make such a
mess when I film I'm so classy so I just
have to have a huge old bathroom towel
out just for me to do that oh isn't this
little it was a flowerpot I got it I
think Meyer or Target I don't remember I
think it was Meyer if there's one near
you but it's the cutest little brush
holder and I'm so excited to kind of
upgraded and I just I love how simple it
is I've had a lot of you guys ask me
lately about just thinking about YouTube
and things like that if I would ever
quit YouTube like is there ever going to
be a time where I just want to teach
full-time or vice versa like if I would
ever quit teaching just to do YouTube
full-time and honestly I just don't know
the answer to that I feel like I love
both of my jobs so much I can't picture
myself quitting either one to be honest
but it is something that comes up a lot
and you know I think about it cuz I'm
like oh wow
I would be an even better teacher if I
had all the time in the world to devote
to that or I would be an even better
youtuber if I had all the time to devote
to that so I mean it is like splitting
my time between two jobs that I love so
much and you know I feel like I'm at
that point where I I do feel like I'm
devoting enough time to teaching and I'm
devoting a good amount of time to
YouTube I wish I could film every day of
the week
oh my gosh would be amazing but it ends
up that I can only film like once a week
and I so I have to sit down and spend
like an entire day filming different
videos for the week or the next week and
a half if there's something the next
weekend you know so it really does kind
of trap me in that I I feel like I
feel bad that you're having to see me in
the same outfit for like four videos so
if you've ever wondered why that is why
but you guys are so sweet and you guys
don't usually ever complain about that
so I guess it's not as big of a deal as
I make it in my head but would I ever
quit one of the other jobs
I just don't know and would I ever quit
YouTube I don't think so because I I
just love it too much and I love you
guys and I've kind of realized I love I
didn't even snapchat is so new to me but
I've kind of realized how much I love it
because I feel like I'm actually
interacting with you guys on Instagram I
love it too but it's different because
it's just you know texting but you guys
will send me videos on snapchat on in
snapchat and things like that and I just
love that because then I I feel like I'm
interacting with you and I feel like I
know you guys and I start to recognize
your guys's faces and your names and you
know those little things like that and
you know even though I can't necessarily
comment back to every single thing on
any of my social media including
snapchat I look at them all I read them
all I love that so I hope you always
know that I'm reading them all for sure
and if you were ever curious about how I
shoot my thumbnails I've got the lights
still up and I just lay out this blanket
I mean not every thumbnail obviously
looks like this but everyone thought
when I do something like this I just
recently got this blanket and I'll just
set it out and then just hold my camera
kind of above it try and focus it and
get a picture kind of like from here you
know what I mean
gosh actually it looks better on my
phone and it does on the other camera I
might do is nothing wrong with my phone
here so Tyler made this thing for dinner
and we're eating as leftovers right now
but it's one of my favorites that my mom
used to make let me show you so it has
green beans and red potatoes and smoked
sausage and it's so easy kind of but you
kind of got to make all the things
separately right here in your jammy-jam
but I'm also about to crack open one of
my favorite things in the world
the grapefruit or Pamplemousse flavored
one it's so so good I can smell that
we've got food are you done napping
Pinocchio see we went over to our
friends house and the dog copper that we
watched which is his buddy beetle they
got to play so he's very sleepy hi puppy
No so what we brought last night to our
friend's house was this dip I kind of
made last minute just like a cream
cheese dip with like celery and green
pepper and you remember what else oh I
should have added sun-dried tomato
member we bought those for that other
recipe should have added some of that in
there but it was really good and we just
had tons of crackers so now we're
snacking on that today so good not very
healthy but really delicious so I've
been wanting to do a video about the
artiste brush which I just ordered
online because I'm so curious I'm tired
of hearing about it I want to know but I
also ordered what I have heard is the
best dupe for and this came this is on
Amazon for like $13 and it's the brand
is Liguori premium oval brush
I don't know size-wise yet until I get
the other one in the mail like if it's
actually but it is the softest thing
I've ever felt and I know that the idea
is that you just brush your foundation
on to kind of blend it in I'm just so
excited to try this to try the other one
see what all the fuss is about but this
is really a pretty a pretty one like I
feel like a lot of the ones I've seen
online as dupes are you know around the
same price maybe a couple dollars
cheaper but they're really cheap looking
and this one looks really like fancy and
nice so we'll see so I recently got a
bunch of PR packages in the mail so this
bag I just kind of aggregated everything
together so remote sent me a package of
a bunch of stuff that I've kind of just
put in here and then the actual bag is
from the balm they sent me like it seems
every single product they've ever sold
and then I also took all my hourglass
their new lip stylos there's a whole
bunch of them I took all of those out
and just kind of put them in here for
now but I mean there's a ton in there
and then I've got my milk makeup fix
that I'm going to be doing a surprise
get a win and not a surprise I guess
anymore to those watching this but and
then I had some stuff
- cosmetics they're trolls palette which
someone told me it's already sold out
I'm like holy moly I posted it on
Instagram the other day and I don't know
if it was already sold out by then or
what but yeah a lot of the stuff I've
tried like the Rimmel one I've tried to
scandalize a long time as I think I
liked it
never tried their brow products I
haven't tried these either they're
provocative so I know some people really
like those try those it's ok it's not my
favorite but I've got a kind of going
through this and organize what I want to
do videos about what I don't what I've
already tried and I don't even want to
listen because I know that I don't need
another one whatever and I'll save it
for a giveaway for you guys and so like
some of this the bomb stuff there's some
really neat stuff in here but someone
that I've already had in the past like
they're down boy blush was one of my
absolute favorite oh my gosh I'm a
cabana boy I don't know if I've tried
that one they've got some that I've
never even seen before this eyeshadow
palette isn't that ridiculous so your
heart out that's so cute but so they've
got some really cool things they've got
a bunch of their they've got their
mascara a bunch of their long lasting
liquid lipsticks which I've actually
heard pretty good things about there's a
bunch of them in here this I didn't know
they sold it's their manager sisters so
it's all the different luminizing so
it's kind like a highlighting palette
and by kind of like I mean that's
exactly what it is although well no it
kind of is more like a bronzer blush and
highlight kind of a thing but really
really pretty there's mary-lou manizer
is gorgeous let me just show you this
wash isn't that ridiculous there's like
an actual swatch of it so pretty so I
can show you what I do like in my closet
I have a little bit more storage in my
closet for makeup
so this first drawer is actually my
reference sure so it's things I keep
because I don't necessarily love them or
maybe they've gone bad or whatever
reason but they're ones I want to keep
just to be able to refer to whether it's
because it's a product I don't like and
I want to be able to hold it up to show
you or you know for one reason or
another so that's kind of what that door
is all about and then this shore is one
that as I get new things that I already
have
I know that I don't need I'm not going
to open these are four brand new
products so some of these might be in a
giveaway and this door fills up very
quickly I just recently did a big
giveaway and just totally emptied this
drawer which is awesome so that's kind
of what this short is all about this
actually is just some cute pins in there
I don't know what to do with and then
I've just got like all my travel size
settings in here like literally all of
my travel size things I have so many
that I go through them so fast it's kind
of crazy and then this is like my
skincare drawer a bunch of backup some
haircare to things that I recently
gotten that I haven't tried yet because
I'm trying to finish up what I'm using
and then this is more haircare in here
just all kinds of stuff so very exciting
stuff so I think I'm gonna end the vlog
here because I need to actually get to
work and like edit and get some things
done hopefully you enjoyed seeing kind
of like behind the scenes my hair is a
mess today I filmed like this I feel
like I'm going to look back at that
