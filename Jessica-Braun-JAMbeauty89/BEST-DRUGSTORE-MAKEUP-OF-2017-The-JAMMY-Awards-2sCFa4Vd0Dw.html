the drugstore version of my favorite
makeup of the year of 2017 I call it the
jammy Awards like Grammys but Jam few do
you know gyms anyway I've been doing it
for a couple years now I'll link my past
GME videos or maybe just last year's
down below this year I decided to
display it into high-end and drugstore
so the high-end version if it is up I
will link it below if it is not stay
tuned it will be soon other than that if
you like this kind of a video definitely
give it a thumbs up and subscribe hit
that little notification bell how do i
how am i doing on my drawing in the air
makes me think of the and Mike's might
think of the like Disney Channel when
they would draw the little thing have
you guys seen the Hilary Duff behind the
scenes of her filming that the like
little Mickey tear thing from this
channel is hilarious she's so
uncomfortable and awkward and it's so
funny anyway alright so let's go ahead
and get into it so I like to go through
these categories in the order that I
apply them to my face and as I said in
the drugstore video if there is a
category that I just really didn't find
anything like throughout the year that I
felt that strongly about I'm not gonna
force it and just suggest something just
to suggest something I'm just gonna tell
you didn't find anything sorry next get
away alright so let's start with primer
because that's what I started with I had
two favorites from the year this is from
NYX it's their Hydra touch primer and
very very hydrating I'm more than
halfway gone kind of is a light blue
tint but of course you don't see that
once you put it on it's very light like
a gel like moisturizer and so for me I
could use this as my moisturizer but
because I have dry skin I like to put on
a real moisturizer first then put this
on top and it just really locks all of
that in do I think that it holds on to
the foundation really well I think yeah
especially for I feel like hydrating
primers can be tricky because sometimes
they're super hydrating but it doesn't
necessarily do anything by way of
holding on to the makeup you're about to
put on top of it but I do feel like this
does actually a really nice job so I
love this totally a dupe for higher-end
versions like the smashbox hydrating one
i actually own and i reach for this one
typically more often and it's much
cheaper so i love that stuff
the other primer similar but also very
different
it's from Catrice which you can get it
alta and it's their prime and fine
beautifying primer and it says it evens
your skin tone optically it's got this
kind of light pink hue to it and hue
that's a word we need to all use more
often I like that but it blends in and
becomes kind of translucent and it
really does give this kind of angelic
quality to your face without being
shimmery or glittery or anything like
this it's just really pretty and I do
feel like when I wear this it makes a
big difference under the foundation that
I'm wearing especially if it's a
foundation that's either more full
coverage or maybe more drying this helps
my skin look really nice underneath and
it does kind of show through in a really
beautiful way and again this is so
inexpensive gosh and now that I'm like
talking about it I feel like I haven't
used it in like a month or so I'm
excited to use it again so let's move on
to foundation holy moly I have three and
I was looking at him and I thought
Jessica come on you don't need to
mention three and I'm staring at him
some more and I'm like I literally can't
pick one I love all three equally
they're all three so good and frankly
they all three have like the same look
on the skin so maybe it'll depend more
on what is more readily available or
cheaper where you live that might be a
great way to decide like if you wanted
to try one of these so let's start with
one that I've more recently been
mentioning a lot but I used to love it
years ago this is the Rimmel lasting
finish foundation my Canadian friend
Jenn sent me one with the pump because
they don't sell it this way here in the
States but I actually have this exact
same model without a pump down there I
wear in the shade one hundred ivory I'm
wearing this today this is the one I
chose to wear and it says it lasts 25
hours I don't know who wears their
foundation that long I'm sure maybe
maybe I don't know really really nice
coverage it looks gorgeous
especially if you've got a nicely
moisturized face underneath it I paired
it with a really expensive primer the
one that I mentioned in my high-end
version from YSL today but I will I'll
pair it with any primer it looks so
pretty above like anything so I really
really like
the stuff it does have a really strong
smell so that leads me to our next one
the number seven stay perfect foundation
I buy mine at Target although I keep
seeing that these are at Ulta randomly
this one does not have a noticeable
smell like the Rimmel does so if you are
like about smell then I would say maybe
opt for this one but it says it's got
medium coverage I would agree
maybe medium to full both of these
depending on how much of it you put on
does have SPF of 15 does the Rimmel one
have SPF No
um so that would mean it's probably
gonna look really nice in photography
like flash photography
this one is SPF of 15 I think it would
still look okay in flash photography I
don't feel like SPF of 15 is not
necessarily high enough that it might
caught you know I don't know I'm not an
expert when it comes to that I will say
that but it just looks so pretty on the
skin like I feel like this stuff just
kind of blends right in especially like
my favorite way to apply all of these is
with a sponge I love my L'Oreal pink
sponge a link below that might be the
winner for the year I'm not even like
mentioning it today but it's like the
winner for the whole year of like my
favorite discovery because it's better
to me than the Beauty Blender then
anything I've ever tried it's so good um
anyway it just looks beautiful on the
skin again it stays all day it looks
beautiful or any primer you just can't
go wrong you just gotta be able to find
your shade that's what's tricky with
really both of these brands their shade
range is not great I'm hoping they both
like expand theirs I've ever showed you
guys my minnie mouse service little
water bottle look I did I bought it
online a while ago alrighty so the last
foundation is my ELF flawless finish
foundation I've owned a lot of these
over the years it does have SPF 15 it's
oil-free it's got a pump it's like six
or seven bucks an incredible foundation
now they did recently expand their shade
range and I'm hoping they continue to
because I think this foundation is doing
well and that's good
this is the shade porcelain which is
great for me now sometimes I'll go to
because sand they're next anyway but for
salons perfect for me right now shade
wise but again it's got that nice medium
to buildable full coverage just fought
like literally I could put any of these
on
with the blindfold I wouldn't be able to
know which one is which other than the
fact that rim will has a very specific
smell they are all three so similar and
so freakin gorgeous you can't go wrong
like I said in the other video - it's
gonna be a long one you might want to
grab a cup of coffee tea water whatever
alright let's talk about concealer my
favorite discovery the year again this
was a newer one to me but it rose
through the ranks so quickly that I'm
like yeah it's going in this is the
ultimate eful coverage liquid concealer
mm-hm I'm wearing it today I just have
it here though like I didn't really go
into the corners cuz I used a different
one the high-end one for that but this
stuff it's it's so good like I don't
really know how to explain this stuff
it's so brightening it stays in place
all day it'll blend in so perfectly it
doesn't sink into my fine lines as much
as most concealers do like the Tarte
shaped it definitely sinks into fine
lines for me I've got fine lines that
just won't quit
oh but this does it the least amount
they say it's waterproof maybe it is I
don't know how many people wear tons of
concealer when they're like I don't know
straight swimming but you never know it
says full coverage I would say maybe
more like medium but it's beautiful like
I said I'm wearing it today I freaking
love this stuff so freaking much so much
it's so much better like I have a YSL
like the way I sell all hours consider
all these really expensive concealers
I've been trying and this is the one
it's so much better and so much cheaper
don't you just love that I love one
drugstore wins sometimes high head wins
but sometimes drugstore wins and that is
just like gold let's go ahead and talk
about brows really quickly I really only
had one I have another I might mention
but this is the Milani brow shaping gel
it's just a clear gel honestly I feel
like gels are all a lot of them are made
the same you know they're very very
similar I just love this bullion this
one here I'll use it right now because I
don't wear gel all the time I don't
really have a need cuz my brow hairs are
not that exciting and like going all
over the place but this stuff does such
a great job holding your brows in place
it doesn't make the
crunchy I love that the spoolie is
smaller you know it's I don't know five
or six bucks I really really like this
stuff probably my favorite brow gel the
other one I was gonna mention I actually
haven't even opened this one
I recently ever rid of it because it was
old like it was just too old but it's
the Maybelline define and fill pencil
it's got like this powdery sponge on one
side with like a bat color powder and
then a pencil the other and I freaking
love to this stuff but it gone bad I'd
had it for like way too long I used it a
ton had bought another one that one went
back as I was trying other stuff so I
have a new one of it that's why it's not
open but it's really really good when I
run out of my high-end stuff I'm using
this is definitely what I'm gonna be
using next cuz I freaking love it I have
the shade deep brown which I'm hoping is
the one I was before
anyway I love it alright how my brows
are like wet come on dry all right let's
keep going on the face and then we'll go
to eyes and lips let's talk about powder
I have one that I freaking love and I
have two versions of it and I love both
this is the Physicians Formula youthful
wear powder so they have the
illuminating version or the illuminating
finish and the only way you can tell
it's the illuminating finish is when you
look at the package it's got a really
small circle in the top right corner
that says illuminating finish and the
same for like the matte one it's it's
like otherwise impossible to tell the
two apart so it says it's translucent no
it is not um it's got like nice coverage
that is not translucent so your deeper
skin tone there's no way that that I
don't know anyway I really really like
this stuff and the illuminating version
if you have oily skin you won't like it
and I've even had some of you guys tweet
me and say like no it does not work for
us or these skinny girls there's like a
little bits of shimmer in it but again
you can't like see it see it but it
definitely does add like kind of this
glow to your face then if you already
have a Whalley skin you probably don't
want you probably don't like but I
really really like it reminds me kind of
of the cosmetics one that I love so much
but I've recently been trying the matte
version it's so similar it's just a
matte version and so I feel like again
it's got
decent coverage it's not like a high
coverage powder foundation I think
that's why they call it translucent
because I don't think they sell any
other shades which is insane to me but I
really really like this stuff if again
if you've got deeper skin than me and
you've tried these how does it look how
does it look on your skin because I'm
maybe it really is translucent but I
feel like there's just a little bit too
much nice coverage in it to possibly be
translucent does that make sense but I
really really like it
oh another powder that I probably should
have mentioned with the concealer is
this NYX HD finishing powder in banana I
use this on my under-eye I'm never gonna
freakin run out of it because it's it's
like a normal powder size but I'm using
you know such a small amount for such a
small area on my face that I feel like
it'll go bad before I ever use this up
but the shade banana really is a lighter
yellow a lot of banana shaded things are
meant for people with a little bit
deeper of a skin tone so they're more of
a deeper yellow but this one's very very
light and it's very brightening for your
under-eye it's a thinner kind of a
powder so does it sink does it still
show fine lines yeah I mean really every
powder for me does when I put it under
there and that's why it'll always set
with powder but I feel like this one
does it less so does it less so that
can't be right but I can't think of how
else to say it it doesn't do it as much
and it's just so brightening it's
absolutely wonderful again under ten
bucks and it's gonna last forever though
all right let's talk bronzer then blush
then highlight my favorite bronzer of
the year is definitely if my heart like
pounds when I see these the number seven
bronzers I have this I think there's
only three shades I just recently
acquired their newest shade maple or at
least it's new to me and maple is what
I'm wearing today let me grab it the
packaging of these is gorgeous the even
like the really pretty detail in the
actual pan of powder but this is maple
it's kind of like a swatch isn't gonna
do it justice it's definitely great for
layer skin but they have one that's a
little bit deeper called caramel and
it's really really pretty these are just
perfect they're not so pigmented that
you're like
I put way too much on you know what I
mean which is me like every time I put
anything on a month oh no that's too
much and then this last shade is golden
sand which was the like my original
prankster gosh I love all of these
though I could use any of them but again
the packaging is so beautiful they feel
so high-end even though the price point
really is kind of I always hesitate to
mention like number 7 and drugstore
because it is and like you can get it at
Target and Ulta but sometimes their
price is kind of creep up but I do think
a lot of the drugstore brand prices are
creeping up so they really are more on
par with their prices but these feel so
luxurious their packaging feels
luxurious I feel luxurious using them
and I think that's so cool that a more
affordable brand can make you feel like
you're using something luxurious I think
that's awesome so love love love this
bronzer stays on all day absolutely
gorgeous on the skin and these are
totally matte there's no shimmer in them
which again I like so the only blush I'm
gonna mention from the drugstore that
this year really stood out to me was
from flower beauty I've talked about
these quite a bit recently especially
but it's just their flowerpots blushes
these are just two shades sweet pea and
peach Primrose really pretty again
pigmented enough that they're beautiful
and they show up but not so pigmented
that you're like that too much so that's
the pink one and sweet pea and then the
one in peach Primrose more of a coarse
like a peachy apricot color they're just
pretty flower beauty is supposed to be I
think they're supposed to be a little
more natural to be honest I really
haven't done a ton of research by way of
like you know what is their mission
statement that kind of stuff to know but
I you know with a name like flower and
you know the pictures you see with their
stuff you'd think they'd be maybe more
natural you guys let me know if you
already know so I'm good I really really
like those and I like how there's the
pretty rose kind of a flower thing in it
and also it totally totally reminiscent
of those Milani ones that have like the
3d flower coming out so pretty this
one's not quite as three-dimensional
knees are a lot thinner but very very
reminiscent of that highlighters I have
to this is the essence pure nude
highlight I've every single time I use
this
I literally go oh my gosh every time and
I've been using this for so long and
like literally just yesterday I was
putting it on and I outloud said oh my
gosh because it I just look so good so
good probably the prettiest highlight
out there it's it's almost like you'd
almost think it's like a powder but
there's this Sheen to it
no swatch is ever gonna do it justice
that is just ridiculous so I'm wearing
this on my face not what you see right
there that's actually a like boo-boom
highlight in my high-end version but I
have it like everywhere else on my skin
do you know what I mean like here and
here
and I just I put it on the tip of my
nose it's just such a beautiful like I'd
mentioned about a Laura Mercier one it's
like a candlelit glow but just a little
bit more and it's so freakin pretty it
is so freakin pretty I'm bringing this
we're packing for a trip here really
soon and we might be gone by the time
you're watching this and this is
probably gonna be what I bring it's so
pretty it's pretty in the sunlight it's
pretty in weird lighting it's it's
pretty always it is always pretty this
is not something you're gonna see from
space you know like it doesn't look like
that like I said but it's just freakin
gorgeous it's gorgeous in person on
camera it doesn't matter but if you do
want a buh-bam highlight this is my
favorite from the year this is from
pixie I bought mine at Target it's their
glowy powder in London lustre it was a
collab with Aspen over here on YouTube
and this is just a ridiculous like a
white gold highlighter again you can
totally see from space so pretty you use
such a tiny amount again I'm never gonna
run out of this because you just need a
tiny little amount in that area um it
actually really does look similar to
what I have on my cheeks right now all
right just done my nail in it I hate
that feeling it's like nails on a
chalkboard oh I gotta get it out from
under my nail so gross oh my gosh I'm
such a liar one more highlight this is
the NYX dose of do face gloss I love the
term face gloss I think that's just fun
it's literally just a highlighting stick
with kind of an angle and I usually will
just do this and
just tap it in my highlight areas and I
feel like it's just the perfect little
quick pretty highlight you know what I
mean again it looks pretty in any
lighting cuz it's not a powder I feel
like it stays on pretty well throughout
the day I feel like I haven't really
like checked checked' you know I've
never done like a weird test with this
to see but it's so quick and easy the
packaging is sweet and cute I know that
doesn't matter but I just I really liked
this and it's one of those things that
it's just so quick I reach for it all
the time and I don't feel like when I
tap it tap it in I mean you guys just
saw me do that I don't feel like it
moves the makeup that's underneath it I
don't feel like it moves it around which
is amazing okay one more face mention
before I move on this is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster this stuff is
amazing I'd be remiss to not talk about
it um I wish the like lid open farther
before it like tipped this back drives
me crazy but I have it in the matte
version it's called matte sculpting they
do have a shimmery one I've never tried
I just don't the desire to try don't
really love shimmery blushes but if you
did it might be worth checking out but
what I love about this is that they are
all matte there's more of a warm bronzy
sunkissed shade there's more of a gray
toned contour shade and then this
beautiful kind of beige ivory I use it
as like an under eye setting powder to
be honest it's supposed to be like a
matte highlight so you could put it in
those kind of highlight areas but these
are just so beautiful so pigmented
easily blendable I'll use all three
together like put a little bit of
contour here and then bronze up here and
on top of that you know you do whatever
you want with it it does come with a
little brush which actually is not bad
I've used it a couple times mine it gets
the job done
so it's totally worth checking out and
it's really the only drug store like
contour kit I've ever tried that I
thought like wow absolutely worthwhile
useful if it's good shades for you
obviously not as useful Physicians
Formula is notorious for not having like
any shade options at all which I wish
they would hear our cries all right so
let's oh I have another face products
all right setting spray the Milani make
it last setting spray really really good
definitely the best drugstore setting
spray I've ever tried I do feel like it
holds on to my makeup pretty well most
importantly however I use setting spray
less to hold on to my makeup and more to
make it all melt together and I think it
does a really good job it's very
reminiscent of the mac fix+
to me so I'll even use this if I wanted
to do like a wet shadow look which is
not that often I'll use this too what my
brush is it does the same thing as mac
fix+ and it's cheaper so I really like
this
my bottle has gotten so dirty because I
have travel but there's quite a bit to
our donkey Pinocchio is trying to nap by
me and he has like like he's a dog he's
used to sleeping throughout the day but
he's been up so much over the holidays
and just and this Paul pup he's trying
so hard to nap and like everyone smile
say something he thinks I'm talking to
him and I'll see his eyes open and his
eyes are all red and bloodshot like I'm
so tired like so ok let's move on to
eyes so another newer ish discovery that
eye is so good it's the Ulta matte eye
primer oh my gosh this is better than
like the Urban Decay primer potion
better than two faced shadow insurance
better than so many of those high-end
ones I've tried over the years that I
still own and I use but this one's
better it holds on to the shadows all
day long I almost mentioned the Milani
one cuz that one is also so so good
honestly they are so similar but Ulta
there are more often sales for Ulta so
like here's my recommendation buy this I
don't know why I'm whispering buy this
and by the Ulta concealer when they have
like the buy one get one half off so you
can get even better of a deal and then
use your Ulta $3.50 off coupon you're
gonna be like getting these for freakin
free oh no but I have another Ulta
product no one to mention that you guys
should get so I don't know I really it's
like again the year of discovering like
Ulta beauty brand products that are
really good and I did do like a best and
worst of the brand I will link that
video below if your fears because there
were a lot of good things from that
brand and nobody like don't you feel
like you overlooked that brand I always
like I never would go to the Ulta wall
I'm like
don't care glad I did there's some good
stuff um anyway so it's there Matt
eyeprimer nude so so good highly
recommend I love it again mine's all
beat up already cuz I reach for it every
single day i shadow palace i have to
well three technically but two so the
first one I'm gonna mention are these
Milani everyday eyes pal these are so
freakin good if you can find Milani near
you absolutely probably one of the best
at the drugstore today period I feel
like I've tried it all there at the
drugstore and these just stand out there
so so good so I have two of them I have
must have Naturals which is a lot more
of a you know kind of a cool tone and I
kind of I mean completely a cool tone
palette they have a gorgeous matte black
some shimmer some mats a little bit of a
transition shade I wish this were a
little bit darker to do maybe a little
more with but I love this and then one
that was a little newer to me is called
earthy elements very on-trend right now
you know with these warm tone palettes
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so they only
have two matte shades in this one right
here but they're just beautiful palettes
they're very pigmented they're easy to
blend really good color combinations
guys I just put those on top of the
other what kind of a beauty blogger so
there's like this really pretty burnt
orange there's like this oh my gosh
shimmery Brown just gorgeous gorgeous
and actually you know I think it's
pretty with the gold very classy Milani
does a great job at their packaging in
an actual decent little double-sided
brush you could actually use to create a
look which i think is cool
so highly recommend these they have I
don't know maybe four or five more kind
of sets different colorways which I love
them really really good the other one I
wanted to mention is around the $20 mark
so it's kind of bordering on not
drugstore but I again I had to mention
it's from Pixie it's the its Judi time
to get the look its eye time palette
that's a long name ridiculously amazing
if you've been eyeing like tons of those
high-end palettes that have like the
in browns and oranges go by this one you
will be 100% satisfied I promise you
every look I've ever done with this
palette I get questions like it worked
like Oh what do you know your eyes look
really nice today okay like thanks like
I feel like I try all these like really
expensive ones and no one says boo to me
and then I trade this one that's kind of
pricey I mean I think twenty dollars is
still kind of pricey and everyone's like
oh my gosh that looks so good I'm like
thanks anyway I love this thing so it's
got you know ridiculous shimmers in it
oh my gosh look at that gold right there
oh but then it's got these gorgeous
mattes all of them blend so beautifully
I love this palette it is so good I
think it's such a perfect range of like
everything the only the only thing I
wish it had what well first of all I
don't know why there's ever glitter in a
black shadow ever so I wish that word
just matte black but I wish it had a
like an ivory cream color matte shadow
so that's what I used to blend
everything together and I I wish this
had that but beautiful beautiful it has
transition shades it has it all they are
all gorgeous shades I don't think
there's a single dud in the bunch limit
and again I love how thin the packaging
is eye liner wise don't make fun of me
I'm realizing I need to sharpen this
this is the Milani stay-put waterproof
eyeliner it's like completely broken I
honestly think it might be out looks
like there's a little bit more but I
don't think this goes all the way down I
don't know so I need a shirt first of
all the packaging again is really pretty
with the gold lid it looks it's the same
shape as like they're really expensive
Urban Decay ones and this is just as
good frankly I feel like they could be
the exact same product so there stay put
waterproof liners really really creamy
so black does not move it's got
everything going for it I freaking love
this stuff definitely will repurchase
when I'm done with it wonderful
I'll even put it in the waterline and it
stays pretty darn well there as well so
that's pretty cool this is the third
Ulta beauty product I said it's their
gel liner wonderful gel liner it kicked
my L'Oreal and my Maybelline one out of
my everyday makeup drawer it's so creamy
so black it's what I have on my eyes
today
that's such a thick line this this this
this I love it I I don't know what else
to say about it it stays in place it's
so thick it's so easy to apply
hello and then my favorite liquid liner
of all time that I've ever tried ever
and I know that sounds ridiculous it is
genuinely the best liquid liner I've
ever tried this is the NYX epic ink
liner again that's what I use to create
the wings so I used it on top of that to
kind of flare it out and make it look a
little more even these are like six or
seven bucks I have like three brand new
ones on backup because I'm like
terrified that they're ever gonna
discontinue them super black you can get
a thin line thick line you can do
whatever you want with it it's
definitely a brush tip it's not like a
felt tip and like the Kat Von D liner I
own it's not as black as this this is
absolutely fantastic but it's got the
same applicator as the Kat Von D one
does it is so good if you haven't tried
it and you like liquid liner you've got
to try it it is so so good mascara no
surprise the L'Oreal lash paradise my
favorite mascara it's so good now you've
probably heard from me and many other
youtubers it dries out in like a frickin
month so you have to replace it like
every month it's insane but to me it's
so good that I'm willing to do it if it
were mediocre I'd say no forget it like
there are many other mascaras in the sea
I don't need to I don't need to keep
buying it for you know $7.99 or whatever
it is however it's that good
it's better like I like my it cosmetics
superhero I mentioned that my high and I
absolutely love it so what I'm wearing
today but I like this more it's so good
it's the best mascara ever try and you
know mascara you've really got to find
your cup of tea because I know so many
people like oh my gosh I hate that
mascara and others are like oh my gosh I
love it so you have to know what you
like like this is not a super defining
kind of mascara it's a very thickening
volumizing holds your curl kind of
mascara I love that all right let's
continue into lips again no lipliner I
didn't have one for my high end either
I really haven't found a lip liner this
year
you know I found some that we're good
like but not any that I felt so strongly
about that they were like my favorite
but what I'm wearing on my lips now is
this l'oreal infallible paints in the
shade spicy blush nope in the shade nude
star I also like the shade spicy blush
it's just a really pretty kind of
natural lip gloss but this says it's a
gloss but it's not crazy glossy now I'm
lying to you because I actually have a
Sephora lip gloss on top I forgot I put
that on top of this during my last video
sorry but it's it's just so comfortable
and pretty and you know it's still a
gloss it's it's going to transfer it's
you know you're gonna need to touch it
up but it's so comfortable and I think
it's I like the packaging it's a squeezy
too but it's a doe foot and the
applicator is kind of weird like a
little chair and I really like it so
nude stars this one and then spicy
blushes the other one that I think is a
little bit lighter than this I love them
both another one I fell in love with is
the Neutrogena moisture smooth color
stick oh my gosh this is so moisturizing
this is in the shade pink nude 100 it's
right there it's just like it you feel
like you're wearing a lip balm but it
looks like you actually took time to do
your lips does that make sense they're
so pretty
they're so comfortable this is the only
shade I've tried and have so if you have
another shade you love let me know below
because I am curious to get more of them
alright this is like the only product
like this that I even own in my
collection I used to and remember like
the Revlon lip butters no they weren't
called the Revlon lip butters they were
the UM what was it called like the
Revlon Oh what's gonna drive me crazy
you guys tell me below now we're the
same shape and then those just like went
away
anyway um another favorite I have two
shades I want to share with you these
are the maybelline superstay matte ink
lip colors so good probably my favorite
matte liquid lipstick I found because
they're surprisingly comfortable they
were a little sticky but not like to me
it didn't bother me so this is the shade
15 lover and it's kind of like a whipped
moosie formula but it's so pretty on the
lips and it's so so pretty this is the
shade pioneer I've worn this as
videos recently as well just gorgeous I
mean you know any liquid lip is going to
be crazy pigmented you know cover the
lip completely opaque and these are no
exception but these are just that little
bit more comfortable and yet they still
stay in place it's the craziest thing
and you know they're drugstore price you
know you don't have to spend twenty to
thirty dollars at Sephora on one of
these when these are totally better than
all the other ones I've tried and I
really liked the Ophir liquid lipsticks
I think these are better they're more
comfortable so those are all of my
favorites from the drugstore if you have
not seen my high-end version like I said
I will link it below so you can go check
it out or if it's not up definitely stay
tuned it'll be up soon and if you enjoy
