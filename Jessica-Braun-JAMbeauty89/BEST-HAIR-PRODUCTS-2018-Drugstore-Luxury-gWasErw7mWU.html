going to share with you my favorite hair
products I'm so excited
these are just products that I freakin
love most of these I bought more than
once some of them I used all the way
through and I was like I need to buy
this again so there are a couple that
I've added to my Sephora loves to buy
again I'm gonna be honest I only have
one two items that are like more
drugstore price some of them you can
find on sale and I'll mention that as I
go
and then another you can buy like in
giant-sized at Costco or Sam's Club so
it's a little bit of a better deal I
just realized that I'm more willing to
spend a little bit more money on my hair
and it's not to say that you can't find
good products at the drugstore because
you can't and I'm gonna be mentioning
some of them today but I just tend to
find that a lot of them have lots of
just fillers and sulfates and things
that kind of tend to dry my hair out a
little bit more than it does help them
and so I'm trying to be better about
that now I'm probably gonna mention
something this probably does have
sulfates in it yeah one of the drugstore
ones i mentioning does but i still love
it so i'm gonna mention it anyway let's
go and get into it let's start with my
favorite shampoo and conditioner of all
time Tyler loves it too we buy this at
Sam's Club / Costco it's from the brand
Nexus and we just buy the giant tubs
because we bought small ones once like
at Target on a whim and we are both like
what is this magic so it's the Nexus
Therapy replenishing system so it's got
this caviar complex proteins blah blah
blah I don't understand it but what I do
know is my hair when I use this it's
perfect it's not overly moisturizing
greasy but it's not dry at all it's like
and even when you use it you feel like
you're using a nice shampoo and
conditioner my hair smells great my
husband's hair smells great it looks
great and I feel like it just keeps it
healthier for longer because of this I
guess because of the caviar complex I
don't know but we've gone through many
many bottles you know big pump bottles
of this we continue to rebuy it and
every time I'm like oh I want to branch
out and try something new
I'm like nah I just want to use this
it's so good and when I don't use it I
always notice a difference in my hair
but when I need to really do
conditioned nope deep deeply shampoo my
hair I love my Brio geo scalp revival
micro exfoliate and shampoo this is very
it's like the second one of these I've
used um very minty smelling and it does
have like kind of like little tiny
granules but I mean they're microscope
like it feels like sand it's not like
big gel ball things I use this once a
week I've heard of some people using
this all the time like if you have
really oily scare oily hair or like this
has really meant more to help with like
your scalp and dandruff I really don't
have that problem I just like it for
getting all the oils and gunk out of my
hair and it does an amazing job at that
so you apply it I'll usually leave it on
for a little bit it doesn't even say you
need to leave it on but I usually just I
all kind of massage leave it in for a
minute and then rinse it out but you
really don't need to even leave it in
but another product that I don't
physically have but it's an absolute
favorite is also by Brio geo it's there
don't despair a repair conditioning mask
so it's in the same kind of packaging
but I think it's got more pink on it
instead of the blue and it is my
favorite conditioning mask so I'll use
it especially when I use this I'll use
that with it because you leave it in for
a few minutes then rinse it out and it's
so moisturizing and I feel like the ends
of my hair looks so much less frazzled
when I use it now I mean is anything
gonna really truly repair dead ends no
but it makes them look so much more
together and healthy and I just I love
that stuff it's so good again my husband
used to heal we finished the last one so
I need to buy another one of those but I
love that I'll use that maybe two or
three times a week I mean you could use
it every time if you want unless you
have really really oily hair maybe not
but I absolutely love it I've tried so
many deep repairing mask and that's my
favorite and briault Gio is like the
brand if you're wanting no fillers no
nonsense just the good stuff that's why
I like it an honorable mention by them
that I'm still trying out is their curl
curl shampoo and conditioner I'll put a
picture on the screen it's in my shower
right now I didn't want to mention as a
favor
cuz I'm still trying it out but I'm
really liking it when I wear my hair
naturally wavy curly again it locks in
that moisture so your hair's not all
dried out so that the curls can kind of
stick together and look nice okay what I
used to my hair today before I blow
dried it is this L'Oreal l vivre
extraordinary oil I got this from like I
want to say Influenster a long time ago
and they put it in a black bottle and
they didn't tell you the brand it was
like a mystery like try it out see how
you like it and it's kind of like what
swab does and the curse is like by the
way what you just use the swab they're
like no way oh my gosh I can't believe
twelve can do this they kind of did the
same thing and unfortunately I hadn't
tried it out yet and then they sent a
few weeks later the real thing oh my god
well now I know what it is but it didn't
matter um I really like this this is
actually a brand new bottle the one I'm
using is in my bathroom in my drawer but
it has camellia and sunflower oils it
says it's deep nourishment silky
softness luxurious shine so I'll put it
in my wet hair and finger comb through
my hair after I've kind of put this in
and I really focus it mostly on my ends
because I feel like that's where I need
that hydration but then I whatever is
left I'll kind of run through the top of
my hair I do think it's nice I haven't
really found an oil that is like so
mind-blowing that I feel like I need to
recommend it here that's why I'm just
mentioning this one cuz it's what I'm
using I feel like my hair looks nice and
healthy and you know what I mean so if
you have a hair oil that you love that
you use every single day after you know
like in your wet hair let me know
because I do like this but again I've
tried so many and I really I can't none
of them have really stood out as like
the best one but speaking of blow-drying
your hair
I just recently tried this wet brush but
it's for blow-drying your hair and like
blow drying it straight like blowouts
this is amazing it combs I'm not holding
out too close because there's like my
hair in it and that grosses me out and
it would gross you out - I'm sure just
because anyway I love it it's a round
brush it helps your hair stay silky and
it straightens it as you're blow-drying
it I'll usually just flip my head upside
down and kind of brush through and blow
dry at the same time and I feel
I can do it really quickly and while my
hair is not perfectly straight like you
can see cuz I didn't like straighten it
I just used the brush in the blow-dryer
it's straight enough that I still feel
really put together I don't feel like
you know a mess
but I just I really like it it helps the
dry time I feel like it cuts down on
that it helps straighten it as I go and
it gets through you know like it's no
problem at all
to brush my hair with this like I feel
like it's so I don't know like I feel
like some brushes when I brush my hair
it like adds frizz but this somehow like
really genuinely smoothes it out and I
love that about it this is actually
empty this is my favorite shampoo and
it's so expensive and I'm just like
dragging my feet to buy it
it's the bumble and bumble Preta powder
tray invisible dry shampoo it says it's
UV protective two-in-one style and an
extender to cleanse and lightly volumize
from roots and it smells so nice it does
such an amazing job it soaks up the oil
but there's no white cast somehow and
yet it's not like brown I know that's
not true there's a little bit of a white
cast but it goes away like instantly
I'll just spray it in my roots anywhere
I'm oily even like around my face cuz I
get like foundation you know it just
gets oily and I'll let it sit for a
minute or two while I'm like picking out
my outfit in the morning and then I'll
just massage my fingers through it and
my hair feels so rejuvenated sometimes
I'll go in with a brush but with this
dry shampoo I don't really need to go in
with a brush and that's crazy because
the white you know a little bit of white
house goes away and I feel like my hair
is refreshed it feels clean I don't feel
self-conscious about it it's now there
of course our drugstore affordable you
know options like the Vitesse ones are
really nice they have all different
smells you can find a smell you like
those work just great and I've gone
through so many of these over you over
the years but this is better and of
course the price tag shows it but highly
recommend oh the drugstore shampoo I
wanted to mention but it does have
sulfates is this Garnier whole blends
honey treasures I've mentioned this
before I actually like the shampoo more
than the conditioner so I literally just
bought the shampoo this is a
new one it has the most ridiculously
amazing smell so what I'll do is I'll
use this and it is more of a repairing
moisturizing shampoo so it doesn't dry
my hair out
although the sulfates probably do a
little bit but I'll use it with a deep
conditioning mask so if I'm gonna be
using this I'll usually use that with it
whereas on most days I'm just using my
two nexus one does that make sense so
but I still love this I love the way my
hair smells this is more of a smell kind
of a thing but I do I don't feel like my
hair looks dry after I use it and if
you're needing a cheap option that yes
it might not be the best best for your
hair but there's way worse out there and
like I feel like I'll use so many
drugstore shampoos and my hair like I'll
get out of the shower it's still wet and
I can already tell it's try it out does
that make sense
but I don't feel that way with this now
the conditioner that goes with it is
fine but I just feel like my hair needs
a little bit more moisture and so that's
why I just didn't even buy it this time
actually I bought but I haven't tried
they have a deep conditioner in a pot
the same line and so that's sitting in
the wings in my bathroom to be used next
because I want to try that with this and
see if that's better because it should
be more moisturizing than just their
standard conditioner that goes with this
line so my favorite I have a couple more
but one I don't currently own coz again
I'm dragging my feet to repurchase it
because it's so expensive but when I am
going day to day and let's say I've dry
shampooed my hair and I'm like okay it's
the next day after showering I've dry
shampoo in my hair
but like you know I just it's kind of
lifeless maybe I'm wearing it naturally
wavy most days I do cuz it's just air
dries that way oh and when I'm in a
hurry before work I'm like I don't have
time to blow dry so anyway but the next
day here it's kind of limp and lifeless
I loved when I have my Oribe texturizing
spray
it's like $40 you guys I like savored
that bottle it's like the one I've owned
I couldn't believe I spent the money on
it and it was so amazing
I might weigh it again it is
indescribable because I've tried a lot
of textures and sprays and a lot of them
are good but this one is a league above
when you spray it's like a freaking
windstorm like it techs write it like
tosses your hair for you you don't even
need
your hand to be tossing it while you
spray it just and it has this amazing
smell that I love and I always get a
psycho are you wearing perfume like well
yes but that's not your smelling
it's definitely a texturizing spray
anyway
and it just has the perfect amount of
hold there's a reason like hair stylist
like freaking rave about this stuff and
that's why I bought in the first place
because that's the perfect amount of
hold where it adds this like texture to
your hair but it's not oily it's not dry
it's not frizzy it's not crunchy it's
like I don't even know what it is
it's the weirdest thing and it's almost
as if you have like a pomade but it was
like in spray form and a little more
lightweight because you know pomade can
get that amazing texture like if you
have shorter hair but for my length of
hair I'm not throwing up on me it
doesn't work the same it's like having
that in spray form but lightweight and
it is amazing ah for what I do wear my
hair naturally wavy slash curly this is
my Holy Grail product this is a living
proof curl enhancing styling mousse I've
gone through like six of these it is
truly a mousse and I've learned that the
secret to and of course this is a day
that my hair straight but in most of my
videos my hair is curly wavy and I use
this every single time so I'll put in
some kind of a cream into my hair and
again I'm I'm trying out a few I haven't
found one that I feel like it's like
Holy Grail but then I'll put in this
mousse I'll flip my hair upside down Shh
squirt the mousse into my hand you know
mousse is it just grows and then I'll
just scrunch it into my upside down hair
I'll let it kind of dry I'll throw some
hairspray on top most days let it air
dry for a bit while I'm getting ready
some more and then all diffuse blow-dry
my hair again upside down it adds so
much volume to my hair it's amazing but
on top of that it really holds the curls
together and when I use just a cream and
hairspray it's so limp and weird this
stuff is the secret weapon I'm like
never
I tried to travel without this because I
was carrying on and I didn't have enough
time to order like a travel size of this
online because I couldn't find the
travel size in any store near me and I
was so upset because I wanted to be able
to just kind of have naturally wavy hair
and even when I
with this in my hair looks so much
better and I felt like my hair sucked
the whole trip because I didn't have
this a couple more products this is the
nukes it's from Paris I mean you can
wonder it anywhere but it's their wheel
protégée I'm sure I pronounced that
wrong but it's their dry oil I've had
this bottle forever it is lasting me
forever it's a little oily but it's
basically I'm trying to see what they
say about it it's got its 97.8% natural
and it's multipurpose dry oil for face
body and hair with six precious
botanical oils nourishes repairs softens
here's how I use this I use this as well
just it kind of looks like an aftershave
bottle doesn't it I will get a little
bit in my hand like literally a couple
drops that's why this last thing me
forever and I'll rub it between my hands
so they're all kind of greasy and then
and I'm not gonna do it cuz I've already
done it today actually I can do a little
bit here but I'll take my ends and I'll
rub my hands through them and then
anything left all sometimes like kind of
tamp down up here but you have to be
careful because it is still an oil but
it can just kind of help add shine and
get rid of that the weird frizz if your
ends look a little unhealthy when you
add it to it it just pulls them together
oh my gosh do you see that and it makes
it look like you just freshly got your
hair cut it's the coolest thing it is so
so good so again you can use it on your
body you can use it wherever you want
like I've heard of people using this on
their legs just to add a little bit of
shine I freaking love this stuff this is
50 mils so you could travel with it if
you get this size I'll link it below I
don't know if they sell other sizes of
it but I'm telling you you will not run
out of it I feel like I've been using
this for freaking ever and I'm not even
making a dent anyway it says 12 months
but it doesn't the smell hasn't change
the color hasn't changed that you know
everything's working it just fine so I
don't know I should maybe think about
repurchasing it but the smell is
definitely one you have to get used to
it's kind of like a old lady smell I
don't know how I don't that sounds so
mean but like it's a very mature scent
maybe that's the nicer way to say that I
don't know any old ladies that actually
smell like that but you guys know what I
mean it's a very mature scent it's not
so much that you're gonna like smell
like perfume status but it you can smell
it when you're putting it on that's for
sure
well you can't really kind of really
smell in my hair so anyway a secret
weapon like this is one of those random
things that nobody I feel like talks
about dry oil and yet for me like if I
have dry shampooed the top of my head
and then my ends are all you know when
you dry shampoo sometimes if you brush
it through that your ends get all weird
and try instead of using a dry
conditioner I've just been reaching for
a couple drops of this and instantly
then I do not get the oil up there if
you dry shampooed but I focus it just on
the bottom third of my hair and then my
whole head looks like freshly washed and
like really healthy so I freaking love
this stuff it took me a while to get
used to it but once I did I freakin am
obsessed and lastly my favorite hair
spray I talk about it all the time it's
the bedhead masterpiece it smells so
nice I always buy it on sale at Ulta so
they'll have randomly like two for
twenty dollars or you know buy one get
one free because this original price is
around 20 dollars maybe even like 23 so
I've never bought at full price I don't
even know how I originally discovered
this stuff but I've never bought a full
price I always stock up I literally have
like four in my little hair care backup
center in my closet over there it's my
favorite I've never found anything that
came close again if you're needing a
like hard head kind of a hairspray this
isn't for you but again it's more
texturising in a way because it has some
hold but it's got hold where you can
still tousle your hair does that make
sense I'm never like pulling my hair and
it's like pony and spraying it and
trying to get it that's not what I do so
I'm not using it for that so I don't
know that that would
work as well as you want if you want to
extreme hold this is more for like
everyday like spray it I don't even
spray it on my hair when I wear like
this but I'll spray it when I have it
that natural way it just holds
everything together a little bit more it
smells great
it can serve kind of as a texturizing
spray in a pinch I mean I've been out of
that texturizing spray and I've just
been using this instead and it works
pretty well so alright I feel like I've
talked these hair products to death I
just love all of them so so freakin much
