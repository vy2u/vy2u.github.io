my 2017
jimmy awards not to be confused with the
Grammys but these are my favorite
products that I tried in the year 2017
these didn't necessarily come out in the
year 2017 but they're ones that just I
feel like this year I've been loving and
so I have pretty much something for
every category but if there's a category
I didn't really feel that strongly about
like a certain product then I just
didn't mention it because I didn't want
to kind of force it and mention
something that I didn't really feel like
I absolutely loved so all of the
products I'm gonna mention in this video
are like high-end luxury kind of sub
products and I'm also doing a drugstore
edition so if that version is up I will
link it below if not stay tuned it will
be up soon let's go ahead get into it
alright so let's start with like well
I'm just gonna start a new order I do my
face how about that so let's start with
the primer um I have two primers to
mention and I love them both so much
they're very very very different so the
one I'm wearing today and probably one
of the most splurge item Zin this video
is from YSL and it is there to xalapa
blur primer this was something that I
had been initially turned off because I
got in like a trial size from something
a long time ago and I saw that there was
like gold glitter specks in it and I was
like no thank you
but I heard a couple youtubers talking
about how they really really liked it
I'm like maybe I should get another try
so I tried it fell in love bought the
full size this is like a very smooth
kind of a primer and what's weird about
it what I like about it is whether my
skin is dry that day or normal it always
makes my skin look really nice and most
of you guys if you've been watching my
channel you know how I feel about
glitter on my face I just hate it like
when there's fallout from eyes shadow
I don't like glitter in my highlight
like I don't like glitter on my face
just on my eyes but for some reason even
though you can kind of see these gold
specks when you initially put it on like
I use this today you can't see it
anymore
like it doesn't stand out enough that it
even matters frankly I don't really know
why they even put it in
I feel like it's kind of like pointless
but regardless this primer is just very
smoothing very blurring it works even
when I have tons of like moisturizer on
underneath and I put this on top that's
what I did today
it still works beautifully and I think I
like it because there's so many of those
kind of like silicone feeling kind of
primers that I feel like I'm just kind
of putting a mask on my face this has a
similar feeling but it kind of melds
with your skin and the foundation you
put on top beautifully makes it lasts
all day I travel with it all the time I
have like a small size that I like
literally just refill with this cuz it
is a pump I love it absolutely one of my
favorite products I've ever splurged on
ever it's gonna be a long video by the
way you might want a cup of coffee or
tea I think my coffee is cold the other
primer I wanted to mention is from cover
effects this was like the year of cover
FX for me because there's another
product I'm gonna talk about I feel like
I never really tried any of their things
their stuff and then this year I tried
quite a bit now I think like this was
not sent to me in PR this I bought with
my own money but another product I
mentioned from them they did send me in
PR but you guys know I'm always honest
whether I gotta feel free or not anyway
this is their calming primer and it's
just very lotion like moisturizing but I
feel like when my skin is really red or
you ever wake up in the morning and you
look at your skin and you're like like
it just looks rough you know what I mean
just literally texture might look rough
your face might be red you might have
breakouts or you might be feeling like
there are breakouts and blemishes coming
you know that feeling this is my answer
to it cuz I'll just put it all over and
it feels like I'm putting a moisturizer
on but I'll put this on top of a regular
moisturizer cuz I'm genuinely using it
as a primer using this as a primer and I
feel like it gets rid of the redness
really nicely after about a minute it
just smoothes my skin now is this a
super pore filling smoothing primer no
that's not really the intent behind this
product but I just feel like it calms my
skin down and I just love it and this is
almost gone I feel like I'm so close to
finishing this up so highly recommend if
you have those kinds of mornings
alrighty so let's talk about foundation
shall we my favorite
no surprise to many of you is the
cosmetic CC cream I consider this a
foundation I really don't know why they
call it a CC cream
I mean CC stands for color correcting so
I guess but I mean it is a straight up
medium to full coverage foundation and
that's how I view it so if I'm looking
to like go for a lighter look this is
not what I reach for cuz it really does
have nice full coverage however I do
reach for this all the time and I travel
with this all the time because it has
SPF of 50 which is awesome
crazy good coverage and it makes my skin
look beautiful like it's if I've got dry
skin that day which is most days it just
smooths over it so beautifully and so in
that way I feel like it's more of like a
nice formula and so you know it does
have a pump when I was first seeing
people talking about this years ago I
thought like I don't want it to be a
squeezy two but it actually is a pump
which is pretty cool this one I'm pretty
close to finishing up and I already have
another one I wear it in the shade light
I could probably get away with fair like
looking at my skin now but this still
seems to work when I'm using it with a
Beauty Blender I just love it so much
love love love this is one of those
things actually really I think every
single product I'm mentioning in this
video in the drugstore one these are
products that the second I run out I
will buy it again that's how much I love
them so love that and then the other one
this one gets mixed reviews on YouTube
and I freaking love it
it's from Jeeva she's so again crazy
splurge E but it's a it's their photo
perfection fluid foundation with
sunscreen I have it in the shade perfect
vanilla I have a couple shades but this
is definitely my shade right now and
it's a very light coverage maybe like
light to medium but never like even full
medium it really is more light but I
feel like when I'll put this on
especially with a really good primer it
just looks like I didn't try does that
make sense so it doesn't look like I've
got a full coverage foundation on cuz I
don't but it makes it look like oh my
skin's just like this you know what I
mean which I'm freaking wish but it just
kind of mutes everything down just a
little bit just enough so that looks
like your face is just angelic and I
love this now if you have oily skin no
you will
like it at all its I think definitely
geared towards more dry maybe normal
skin type I think if you have oily I
think it's just gonna move all around
but with this like for my skin I really
really like it so I won't talk anymore
about it it's got a fun little cap on it
alright the next thing I usually do is
concealer I only have one concealer
dimension and I'm laughing because I
watched so many of these kind of best of
the year videos I love this time of year
I love seeing what everyone's kind of
Holy Grail makeup items are and so many
people mentioned like Tarte shaped tape
things like that and I'm like no it
really you guys know really I it's
alright I'll use that I'll use it up
that's about it my favorite is the Bobbi
Brown corrector now this is a true
concealer in the sense in the in the
meaning of the word concealer it really
does conceal dark circles so I used it
today I have it in the shade light
bisque they have a bunch of shades and
you just apply it with your finger just
to that area it gets rid of dark circles
it melts into my skin like instantly I
can use a blender I can use my finger I
can use a brush it doesn't matter how I
blend it out and often I do travel with
this pretty much every single time I
travel and you don't need anything else
with it you don't need another concealer
now I am wearing another one which is
one of the drugstore ones I mentioned in
the other video just because I wanted to
wear as many of these products as I
possibly could see you guys could see
them on but this is absolutely my
favorite concealer of all time I will
buy it again when I run out and I think
the reason I like light bisque is
because it is kind of a salmon
light light light salmon tone so it does
a great job if you have like purplish
dark circles like I do what I also love
and this is one that I had for a while
and I really didn't reach for and I
don't know why and then finally like I
would say maybe the past five or six
months I started reaching for it and I'm
like oh my gosh like this is so good
it's the laura mercier secret
brightening powder people used to talk
about this a lot which is when I bought
it and it's smaller than like they're
like legitimate like powder it's a lot
smaller it's a very very white very
brightening
thin thin thin thin powder and the way I
apply it is just with a sponge a wet
sponge I just dip it in and just kind of
put it on as if I'm baking even though
I'm really not truly and then I just
wipe away the excess and it it does have
like a sheen to it like almost like very
very fine shimmer but it looks so pretty
and I feel like because of that the
light reflects off again I'm wearing it
today and it's just so so pretty now if
you've got a very very deep skintone and
you've tried this let me know how it
works because I do wonder me being as
fair as I am you know a white yeah it's
white but I can wipe it away and I feel
like it just looks brightening but does
it end up looking like it's way too
white on deeper skin tones I'm just
curious so let me know if you've tried
that below alright let's talk about
powders I have like three to mention but
they're all very very different so the
first one I just held up this is my
favorite loose powder it's the Laura
Mercier loose setting powder and
translucent they do have one deeper
shade so they've two shade one that's a
little bit deeper to be more translucent
on deeper skin tones and then this one's
a little bit lighter so this stuff it's
definitely got a cult following and I'm
the kind of person and I know a lot of
you guys are too where I'm like why like
it's just a loose powder and so when I
bought it a long time ago and I think
this is like the second one I've had of
this I would try it and be like okay
like it's just a loose powder I don't
use that much loose powder so I really
didn't know what really makes a good
loose powder and so over the past year
or two I've tried a lot more loose a lot
more brands you know of loose powders
and I've kind of realized this really is
a step above all of the rest and I think
it's because it and I have it on today
like I really just put it here and on my
nose and like right here anywhere for me
that I have like pores and kind of just
weirdness I feel like it just smooths
out the area and what's weird is you'd
think with the powder that it would like
enhance in a bad way any dry skin or
weird patches or pores no it like fills
them in and
moves it out and I'm I'm falling back in
love with loose powder just in those
areas I used to put it everywhere and
I'm like this too much you know like the
peach fuzz you have on your cheek it
would catch the light but here and Here
I am just like obsessed with it because
it looks like a baby's bottom I mean can
you tell and so I I just I love it I'm
gushing about it because I love it and
you know there are other ones that have
come close like the cover effects makes
one that I think is really good I
actually really like the Too Faced peach
perfect one but this one is still the
one that like if I had to pick one
period for the rest of my life it would
still be this one I just think it looks
just that little bit better all right so
on to other powders this hourglass
ambient lighting powder and dim light
there's a lot of confusion about these
when they first came out a couple years
ago about oh oh are they highlighters
like what are they but really these were
meant to be finishing powders they were
meant to be used all over your face if
you'd like and then of course now
they've come out with strobing versions
that are definitely highlighters you
know lots of glitter in a lot of them
and I'm not a big fan of all of those
but this one in dim light is perfect
I'll throw it all over my face I used it
on my face basically everywhere but the
center so I have it all on the outer rim
of my face and it just gives this like
candle light glow to your skin if you've
never tried something like this you've
got to because you especially if you're
someone that you don't really like
powder you'll like this powder because I
again being a dry skin gal didn't really
like powder I'm like why would I want to
put that all over my face
I used to do that when I was younger and
then I'd see pictures back oh my gosh
like I was seventeen and I looked way
older because there's a powder you know
but this stuff doesn't look like powder
it looks like this glowy but not
glittery not shimmery there's not a
single speck of shimmer in this that
I've ever seen
and again I think this might be like the
second one of these I've had it's just
gorgeous candle glow that is the best
way to say it so I just love it so so
much and then I also have the it
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination powder foundation I have it
in the shade fair this
is the second or third one of these I've
owned I think I love it so much this is
a newly repurchase one I've already used
it quite a bit in the past few weeks
this is a full full coverage powder
foundation so if you love powder
foundation you haven't tried this you've
got to try it again if you have oily
skin you won't like it
it has that illuminating quality to it
but for me what I'll do is I'll grab
either a brush or a sponge and just kind
of dip it in and put it on especially
like if it's like the second half of the
day and I just need to kind of touch up
my face maybe my nose has some redness
peeking through I'll grab a sponge with
this and just put it on my nose and it
looks frickin flawless it's the craziest
thing I've never found a powder
foundation that worked as well as this
that I've loved as much as this and it's
worth the price tag every single time I
am legitimately drinking cold coffee
right now and I drink it black I used to
get like I'm like really weak enamel and
so I remember tangent alert by the way I
remember going to the dentist a few
years ago and the dental hygienist was
like so looking through your history you
really do have a lot of cavities I'm
like you know I don't know I floss
pretty often I brushed my teeth morning
and night you know I don't brush at the
middle of the day she's like well you
know you don't necessarily have to do
that that's not necessarily what would
cause it I'm like well she's like do you
like eat a lot of sweets I'm like not
really I mean I don't think any more
than like normal people do and then she
hit the nail on the head she was like do
you drink coffee I'm like yes she's like
do you put creamer and I'm like yes and
she's like do you drink it throughout
the day I'm like yes she's like it's
just literally all day long eating away
at your teeth so I literally just kind
of cut out creamer completely and got
really used to black coffee now I really
like black coffee and then I'll get like
some flavored black coffee and stuff
like that it's not like super flavour
but you know um and it's really helped
I've had far less cavities although I
feel like I can like feel one coming in
I'm like my poor teeth anyway how did I
get on that tangent oh so drinking black
coffee cold it's just like I feel like
it's like I remember you kidding my dad
having like black coffee and it'd still
be cold knees like Jeff's will you go
heat this up I'm like
all right dad anyway okay focus focus
focus
so powders are done let's just talk I
have one brow product that's it one that
stood out from this year high-end I have
a couple when we get to the drugstore
one high-end this is from pretty vulgar
and it is their arch eyebrow pencil is
it called arch no I think I'm thinking
of the hourglass one it's just their
eyebrow pencil I have it in the shade
quick wit you know it's what I used on
my brows today frankly it's what I've
been using for the past like 4 months
like exclusively I've not used anything
else um I just really like it now if you
don't like like a thicker brow pencil
like this has kind of that triangular
shape and it's thicker you won't like it
but for me I just go to to do dilute and
then I turn it sideways to kind of do
the tail that's it I brush it through
with the spoolie do I think this is like
the most special brow pencil in the
world no the hourglass one I've tried is
honestly exactly the same the anasazi
one is exactly the same they're all kind
of the same and they're also kind of the
same price point so I really really like
this but when I run out do I think I'm
gonna run out and buy it I will if I
don't feel like I can find a good shade
match and other stuff because I think
the formula is really good but I don't
think it's like life-changing and so I
almost hesitated to mention a brow
product at all but I figure you know
this is what I've been using I do really
like it so I figure just to let you know
let's do the rest of the face first and
then we'll get to eyeshadow palettes and
eyes and lips okay so okay okay okay so
bronzer this is the NARS Sun it's like
their sun-washed diffused bronzer in
Laguna so I had regular Laguna for a
very very long time and I really really
liked it but it did have kind of like a
shimmer to it and I'm like mom this does
not and it's a lot more like the name
would kind of indicate diffused look and
I love that again if you've got light
skin this is really written aside they
do have a lighter shade but I was like I
feel like Lagoon is still good like it's
it's a good shade so it's funny because
I'll put it on and sometimes like oh I
can't see it and I'll put a little more
on I'm like there it is it's perfect so
I love that you can't really go
overboard with this which I really
really appreciate
now it's not what I'm wearing today I'm
wearing a drugstore one but frankly it
looks just about the same as this
drugstore one does just very kind of a
lighter bronze look and I love it
alright so let's talk about blush I have
two blushes to mention one is from
hourglass I clearly really liked their
formula of like powders very it's a very
very thin powder it's weird
this is their ambient lighting blush and
mood exposure again this is one that if
you're deeper than me you won't like
this so I guess for this I would
recommend really their whole line they
do have some that have glitter in it I
don't love those might have one that's
called euphoric fusion that is really
pretty very very light that would look
gorgeous on deeper skin tones so I will
link that one below as well but this is
the one I love it's like I said almost
looks like whitish there we go the
swatch kind of shows the true color of
it though and it's just one of those
things that I can never put too much on
it never looks unnatural or weird or
anything and it lasts all day so
absolutely adore this color and then the
other formula of blush that I'm really
liking is the Becca mineral blushes this
is in the shade flower child and I'm
finding myself reaching for this all the
time it's a right there kind of a
brighter pink I actually just ordered
two more of their mineral blushes
because I just loved this one so much
and I was like oh my gosh forget it I
just want them actually it was on
HauteLook and so there are 50% off and I
was like oh my gosh so I'll link holy
look below it's like a flash sale site
so like Becca will be on there for like
three days and there's just all kinds of
products for half off anyway and I've
even checked batch codes on the items
I've never gotten old items from them
nothing it's I don't know how they do it
at such a discount anyway I love it so
it heard two more I can't wait till they
come but those also lasts all day
they're just like beautiful on the
cheeks they look they can get you know
you do have to be a little more careful
I do you think these colors are a lot
more like obvious so you have to be a
little bit more careful but I just love
them highlight oh my gosh okay three and
they're all again very very different
highlighters so probably my favorite of
the whole year is this Laura Mercier
matte radiance baked powder again this
is like a candlelight glow but with like
a
and cologne to it because it is meant to
be not necessarily an all-over face
powder but more in the highlighted
target areas highlight targeted areas
you know so it's oh my gosh I just love
it it's not glittery at all but it's got
this shimmer to it that it just in any
light looks beautiful I feel like it
doesn't make me look older than I am it
doesn't make me look younger than I know
that sounds like a bad thing it just
beautiful on every skin and so and by
every I mean mine but I feel like so
many highlighters I'll try and I know
you guys are probably the same way like
ALPA highlighters here and good oh my
gosh like I've got crow's feet going
into it so if you're any older than me
or you have the same kinds of issues
it's like well I don't want to highlight
or emphasize that I'm aging you know
what I mean so this does not do that to
me and I love it so much now I do have a
drugstore version I'm gonna briefly
mention right now just because it's
worth mentioning it'll also be in my
directional but it's the essence pure
nude this is like under five dollars
this is like 37 dollars I'm sure and
they are very very similar so love this
stuff I'll just go crazy with it just
all in this region here well like here
here here here I mean you can put it
anywhere it never looks bad it's so
beautiful so for a more like BAM
highlight this is this was new to me
this year my friend Laura told me about
it and it's so beautiful it's from pure
and again like pure is one of those
things that I've tried things off and on
and I've liked some things a lot and
I've really not like some things a lot
you know so it's very hit-or-miss but
this is their illuminating powder and
afterglow it's right there and it's just
this like white gold highlighter and
there's something about it I'm wearing
it today right here there's something
about it that just always catches the
light so beautifully this is one though
that I do like to target I don't like to
just go crazy like I would with this
that can be really careless with this no
it's one of those houses you really need
to be pinpointing where you want it so
one of my favorite ways to apply
highlighter
this is with like a fluffy eyeshadow
brush because those are really small but
they're big enough so you can really get
the area's you want without going too
far outside the lines love this stuff
totally took me by surprise and then the
other highlighter I wanted to mention is
from RMS beauty which again was new to
me this year I now have two of these but
this is like their original kind of a
cream highlight and it's called living
Luminizer and I'd heard about it like in
a magazine like a bunch of celebs were
wearing it and it is truly a cream
highlight but it's not it's almost oily
in a way not in a way that it's gonna
move your makeup underneath around but
in a I don't know how else to describe
it kind of a way it does feel kind of
oily it's not like a cream to powder
does that make sense it does it's not a
cream to powder so what I'll usually do
to apply it is either grab the tip of my
sponge or just my finger and I'll just
tap it in those areas and it's so
freakin pretty this is even pretty just
on straight-up bare skin or just on BB
cream it's pretty on full coverage looks
it's pretty on like no makeup makeup
looks it's just pretty all around you
can put it on the tip your nut wherever
you want and you could even put it to
make like glossy lids now I've never
done it with this I've tried like glossy
lids before and they always just feel
like sticky and like I can't close my
eyes all the way it's just weird this is
not sticky though so it could work
sorry if you hear noises tyler is
working on the bathroom floor
I hope I'm excited about the floor
though anyway so I really like the stuff
I also have one called master mixer
that's like more of a kind of champagne
e gold kind of color if maybe that would
more suit your skin tone cuz of course
this is like white you know and then
they have another one called their magic
Luminizer that I want to get my hands on
soon very intrigued to try that one
alright so let's move on to eyes it's
also fun so my favorite high-end primer
is from Mac which Mac is now sold at
Ulta which is exciting not like
everything they sell because that would
be crazy but a lot of they're like
popular products and this is definitely
on there this is their Paint Pot in soft
ochre again
pending on your skin tone you would get
a different shade but if you're anywhere
near mine this is more of a yellow based
kind of beige color and I just like it
it's so quick to just dip my finger and
Pat it on it covers anything I need to
cover it holds on to shadow really well
I mean I have no complaints about it
I've repurchased this many many times I
know some people get freaked out by the
Pott I just don't really care I figure I
used it up quickly enough that it I
don't know I just don't really worry
about it
so that is wonderful so let's talk about
how I have two pallets and then I have a
story about one of these freakin pallets
as I was looking at my palette drawer
today I thought I have to mention that
one I really genuinely love it it's the
Too Faced sweet peach palette and I feel
like to fix is one of those brands that
you know when you hear youtubers talk
about them you're like yeah yeah like
you got it sent to you for free
um and they're just so the brand is so
out there on social media that I don't
know like I always feel like even when
I'm watching two-faced reviews I'm like
I take it with a grain of salt but I
know myself too and I know I'm a
youtuber that gets to face in PR so I
did get this in PR oh my gosh a year
over a year ago now and um smells so
good if you don't like peaches you won't
like it and I know some people don't
who so this I used way more than I ever
thought I would ever because there are
some colors I'm like no no thanks like
this darker glittery purple like no and
I don't use it the green I really don't
use the black I use often um but it's
these other colors like these colors
over here
they're shimmers like this shade
luscious is my absolute favorite it's
kind of a topi not even topi I guess
it's more of like a rose gold
I even like just peachy I'll put that
all over my lid sometimes when I'm
feeling pink peaches and cream is just a
great matte one we've got some great
like light Browns I love this palette so
so much so I was kind of surprised like
I said and sometimes to face bouts I
don't like but like the chocolate ball
palettes are huge hits for me I love
those and this one I think I like even
than those now another one I almost
didn't mention because it was new to me
like very new but I thought you know
what I have not felt this strongly about
a pallet honestly all year like I don't
even know that I felt this strongly
about this one this pallet actually
subscribers sent to me to my peal box
and it was so unexpected and so
incredibly sweet because it was one that
I just had my eyes on and I talked about
I guess in a video or two and it's the
violet Voss palette now violet boss is
now sold at Sephora which is why it was
kind of on my radar because I usually
like I didn't buy an e violet boss
before that and it's their Holy Grail
palette so the story of this palette is
other than that this morning well okay
it was like afternoon when I was getting
ready and I'm wearing this palette
exclusively on my eyes um I had coffee
near it actually it's this very same
freaking cup that I'm drinking out of
now except for I knocked it over and it
dumped literally on top of the pallet I
couldn't leave I'm like no diverse
thinking there's something like very
seriously wrong I'm like no it's fine
it's just my palette and it's just it's
no big deal except for I was going to
get ready with it and it's my favorite
and I was gonna mention it now I feel
like it shouldn't and you know like all
easy so we're both kind of dabbing it
drying it off and then I'm getting it in
the carpet so I was literally at the
carpet cleaner in the room right now
with me so I'm cleaning the freaking
carpet like all these things on my fan
and anyway turns out it was fine
I like I and I literally use it today I
went through every single shadow and
kind of finger swatch it just to see
like is everything okay
everything was fine it was really weird
anyway this palette is the perfect
palette I realized for me it's got
everything I want
it's got tons of transition shades like
this one is literally called transition
it's what I'm using in my crease today I
have Plouffe on my lid
I have crystal and thanks a lot a on my
brow bone I think I put are you kidding
me in my crease a little bit and that's
pretty much it but you can use you can
do darker looks with this lighter looks
but for me since I typically do looks
like what I'm wearing today
most days that's why I love it because I
can do that and so we're I'm packing
soon like I might already be there when
you're seeing this video for our trip to
Disney it's a Disney cruise as well
we're doing all kinds of stuff and I'm
pretty sure this is gonna be the pallet
I bring cuz I freaking love it I wish it
were smaller but I freaking love it love
it love it love it love it more than my
naked palette some more it is amazing so
I don't care that it's new to me I still
had to mention it it blends like a dream
its pigmented there's not like there's
not like crazy fallout like I've got
like a Natasha doesn't own a pallet and
I have the what's the other Red Hood a
beauty palette fallout City on so many
of those none with this palette I
freaking love it oh my gosh
alright so singular eye products that I
was so blown away by this year that I
felt were worth mentioning are first off
these milk makeup pigments I'm not a big
like cream shadow fan like I'll use them
from tiny I don't not like them but I
very rarely reach for them but these
blew me away and so if you are a fan of
those these are my two favorite shades
after party and gig after parties a
little bit more pinky toned
I mean you it's just a squeezy tube and
you know you can apply it with your
finger you could probably apply it with
the brush oh my gosh it's so pretty so
that one's after party and then gig is a
little bit more bronzy than that not
quite as pink these are gonna last you
freaking forever I mean these are you're
never gonna run out it's a big ol tube
of this stuff and you need the tiniest
bit so if you found a shade you love
because they have tons it's worth buying
one do you need like four of these no
absolutely not like even me I think they
sent these me in PR and I got rid of
most of them it only kept a couple
because I'm like I'm not gonna use these
but find a shade you love and invest
it's so so worth it and so beautiful and
they once they dry they are there all
day
they are not moving and now they're
similar product are these butter LONDON
glaze and eye glosses and I saw these
like on sale on Sephora's website for
like half off like in the sales section
like are they discontinued please don't
be discontinuing them um I don't know
that they are but they're like these
weird goopy they look like pudding
little eye gloss kind of things
similar idea and really a similar look
so this is the shade icing right there
if it grosses you have to put your
finger in this kind of a thing I mean
you could always use a little tiny
spatula or something else or you could
get the milk ones because it's a little
less you know it's a little more
hygienic maybe but this one is in the
shade moonshine these are clearly my two
favorites I've talked about them in
another video - this one's got glitter
in it but the glitter does a good job of
saying suspended in the liquid so I
don't feel like I get much follow up so
that's moonshine they're absolutely
beautiful again once these are on and
dry they're not moving at all I will
probably have a hard time getting these
swatches off so I might take them off
right now but gorgeous gorgeous like I
said I think those glaze on ones are
like $24 and I saw them for $12 on
Sephora website like after Christmas I
was like I don't know if that's forever
I don't know if they're just continuing
them but y'all better snatch them up
okay so the next thing oh oh liner I
only have one liner to mention it's this
hourglass 1.5 millimeter again I've even
asked you guys like are there any
drugstore dupes for this it's such a
teeny tiny retractable liner but it's
incredibly creamy it's not dry it's not
crumbly you don't have to tug it your
eye
I could literally look at with my eye
open and just do that like and it would
tight line my eye flawlessly amazing
however it's expensive I run out of it
really quickly I think well I think it's
like $18 for one of these so I've bought
the 3-pack finally because I'm like I'm
running I'm flying through these so you
can buy a 3-pack as well but I don't
think it's a discount at all I think
it's like the same price it's just more
convenient if you know you love them and
you run through I just love it I've not
found a drugstore do but like liquid
liner wise I didn't find anything this
year that I felt that strongly about
because I have a drugstore version that
really genuinely is my favorite so I
didn't feel like kind of forcing it and
say what y'all liner I didn't really
find anything I liked I am my favorite
high-end mascara is the it cosmetics
superhero however it's such a wet
formula and when you first open it it's
flawless like from the mole
you open it like I would say a month and
a half two months but after that like
it's really goopy and like I used it
today and I had to use my L'Oreal lash
paradise to kind of comb through it
which is funny because that's not really
a super defining mascara either but it
was more so than this because it was
just getting so wet and clumpy and weird
so I think I just need to replace this
one but I love this stuff crazy volume
holds a curl works this day you open it
which i think is a big deal for me and I
just really really really like it let's
talk lips I only have three products I
am a Butthead when it comes to makeup
what duh lips because I'm picky like I
don't really like liquid lipsticks
anymore I although if I mention any even
in the drugstore no I do mention one in
the drugstore cuz I did find one I
really really liked but I'm kind of over
that and so and then I like lip liners I
really didn't have any high-end that I
felt that strongly about so I'm just
gonna genuinely mention what I've been
loving this year first the Copart lipped
love I've only had now I don't know what
a couple months it was accidentally sent
to me and I fell in love with it and so
now I'm definitely gonna repurchase it's
there coconut lip love and it's freaking
it smells like actual coconut not like
fake whatever it smells like actual
coconuts and every morning when I put it
on I'm like oh my gosh like every
morning I love it so much do I think
it's like doing amazing things to our
lips I really don't know like see like
my lips haven't been super chapped so I
guess that's a good sign but like I use
different lip things at night you know
what I mean different lip masks and
stuff so I don't know what's to blame
for my lips being in pretty good health
but I do love this and I do use it every
morning and I will repurchase it when I
run out so my favorite lipstick of the
year you're gonna be surprised it's not
the Marc Jacobs even though I love that
but I feel like I've talked it to death
this is the NARS audacious lipstick I
have it in the shade Raquel I used to
have another one and it just like
disappeared like someone took it I love
it
this form is so incredibly creamy this
is probably creamier than the Marc
Jacobs want to be quite candid but
they're both incredibly pigmented
they're just so creamy and I love
applying them
I always feel like I have a good lip
look when I use these obviously it is a
standard kind of a lipstick so you are
gonna need to reapply there is gonna be
transfer I don't mind that if I'm
wearing lipstick I kind of am
anticipating needing to check up on it
from time to time reapply etc so love
that and I love the sleek black
packaging it's magnetic I love it the
lip gloss that's high-end high-end it's
the Sephora brand I still consider that
high-end because some of their products
are so expensive but this is their
mm-hmm outrageous
plump effect and it's in the shade zero
to maybe the shade is that where you
just I don't know but either way it's in
the shade zero two it's a very kind of
tingly plumpie kind of lip gloss does it
actually plump I don't know I don't
really need the plumping but the color
is just so it's right there just a nice
peachy nude it doesn't completely change
the color of your lips but it just makes
them look put together and nice maybe
I'll put some on top of what I'm wearing
now ah I love it it smells good
that the DOE foot applicator is kind of
interesting it's more circular and um I
really really like it it's it's
comfortable it smells it does have kind
of a smell that might be off-putting to
some like well it's kind of like
slightly sweet slightly chemically you
know what I mean like I don't know I
don't necessarily like the smell let me
just say that but once it's on after
like a minute do I really notice the
smell No so oh I have one more thing to
mention how could I forget this this is
my favorite setting spray oh my gosh I
love this is heading spray this is the
cover FX mattifying setting spray do I
think it makes your skin look 100% like
totally matte no but to me that's not
really where I use it which I'm sure is
weird because it's called mattifying
setting spray I like to put setting
spray on a to hold on to my makeup for a
long long time throughout the day but
also just to kind of melt everything
together
no matter
what I'm using whether I'm using in
Dewey one or a mattifying one or just
the kind of middle-of-the-road one but
this one does such a great job of I feel
like you know with some settings phrase
even mattifying once I feel like I'll
still look really shiny here even though
I don't really have oily skin but with
this stuff when I spray it on it dries
down and it really does I feel like kind
of soaked up just a little bit of oil
but it still makes my stuff all look
like it's melted together my stuff all
my makeup and layers of nonsense that I
have on my face so I love it the nozzles
great I even like this simplified
packaging Wow really fell in love with
that this year so those were all of my
favorites from 2017 for the high end
kind of side of things like I said the
drugstore side of things that video will
be up if it's up a Lincoln if it's not
stay tuned I hope that you'll subscribe
and if you enjoyed this kind of a video
definitely give it a thumbs up and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
