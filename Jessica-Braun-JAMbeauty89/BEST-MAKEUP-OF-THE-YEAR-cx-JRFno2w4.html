share with you guys my favorites from
the year 2017 I was filming these videos
I call them the jammy Awards because my
original screen name was Jam beauty 89
and Jam was my initials but now I'm
married so my initials are now jab but I
still kept it because I think it's fun
and now it's just tradition but this is
kind of my roundup of my favorite
products from the year now I'm not going
to be doing every single category and
which I think I've only done one or two
years anyway just because I didn't want
to force myself to pick something in
every category just to pick something
when I might not feel that strongly
about it because I feel like there are
certain categories like eyeliner that I
don't feel that strongly about a pencil
eyeliner just yet that I would call it
my favorite from the year so but I do
have a lot of goodies so let's go ahead
and get into it so let's start with the
face so one of my absolute favorites
this year which took me by surprise was
the Too Faced hangover RX primer this is
kind of one that I bought kind of on a
whim a lot of people have talked about
and I felt like well I've got dry skin
maybe that'll be good for mine I love
this stuff it's like a really light
lotion and wow I don't think it can
replace completely a moisturizer I do go
a lot of days where if I'm in a rush
this is what I sit on I don't even put
on a moisturizer so and it still my feel
my skin doesn't look super dry
throughout the day I really do feel like
it moisturizes do I think it's the most
moisturizing primer that's out there no
but I do think it does its job of
holding on to the foundation or tinted
moisturizer and moisturizes your face
just enough and it smells so nice and I
think the packaging I love that it's
going to squeeze you too with the pump
it's like the best of both worlds I wish
more products came like this so I love
it and it's a little bit coconut by the
way the next product is probably like if
I have to like rank these it would be
top three this is the Physicians Formula
youthful wear powder and it's their
youth boosting powder and it's been
translucent but it's their illuminating
finish they have a matte finish and an
illuminating finish I can't say that and
and illuminating finish and this was the
illuminating one and I love it because
it gives this look
your skin that looks healthy and
complete like it kind of gets rid of any
discoloration because it does have some
coverage I think to it but it also has
this nice glimmer to it where you don't
look shimmery but you do have a glow
about you and I'll put it everywhere on
my face so I need a little more coverage
I'll even put it just kind of just set
my concealer sometimes but it's just
such a nice formula stays on all day and
I really notice the difference in the
way my skin looks at the end of the day
when I use this versus when I don't so
like when I get off work and I look at
myself in the car mirror if I was
wearing this that day my skin looks
great if I wasn't you can tell like my
foundation will be kind of breaking
apart I'll look like you can see all of
my you know hyperpigmentation and
different things like that this is such
an amazing product because it's not just
a powder foundation it's not just a
highlighter or you know like one of
those kind of nice base powders and it's
not just a mattifying powder kind of
combines the best of all of that so I
love it I think if you have super oily
skin you might not love it you might
want to try the matte finish I haven't
ever tried it but so let's keep going on
face this is the elf flawless finish
foundation and I talked to stuff to
death so I won't talk about it for too
long but it's a great foundation it's
got I would say medium to buildable full
coverage and it has a pump it's a glass
bottle it's really nice for the price
and I wear it in the shade sand but it
just has this again kind of a satin
finish where you don't look super matte
but you definitely don't want dewy it's
definitely not a dewy finish foundation
by any means but for me with dry skin I
really struggle to find a foundation
that doesn't just it's either like I
have something that's crazy crazy duty
because it's that's just the way it's
marketed but I don't always love that
but I also don't like super-dee-duper
matte foundations a lot of the ones I've
tried I have hated just illuminated dry
spots etc this one's right in between
and I think that is why I love it so
much I haven't found a foundation like
this yet anywhere drugstore high end
anywhere and it just happens to be that
it's so inexpensive and so that's what
makes me love it even more and want to
recommend it to you guys even more I was
so blown away
because I really did you know I love elf
products but I also know that they have
their fair share of misses at least for
me and so the fact that this is the
foundation that's really good I thought
was amazing so if you haven't tried it
and you're still looking for that just
right foundation it might be worth
trying I've got some blushes to
recommend one is an hourglass one and I
cut again this is another one that I
bought on a whim I was like I really
even want to try those but I kind of
randomly picked a shade I thought might
work and it's one of their hourglass
ambient lighting blushes in mood
exposure that's the name of the shade
and it's kind of a swirled look you know
everyone you get looks a little bit
different but it kind of got this
pinkish grayish not grey that's a weird
term for it but just a nice light cool
pink color to it it's a foolproof
product that when I want to look
flawless but also when I'm in a rush I
can grab a brush and this throw it on
and it always looks perfect you can't
really overdo it I mean you could but it
just it always looks just right and I
never have to mess with it and worry
about putting on too much or too little
it's always perfect so I love that for
this I've looked at the other shades in
swatch them and I think I think they
might not be right for my skin tone but
I like the formulas as well it stays on
all day so definitely changing 89 stamp
of approval on this baby
another blush I would recommend is from
quo this was sent to me from a Canadian
subscribers this past year and it's
their baked blush in the shade pinched
this is one of those products that I
don't need a highlighter with and yet
you can still put it it's not just like
a blush topper type of a blush it's a
beautiful blush that also happens to add
the most perfect amount of glow it's not
too much where you feel like is like she
just got highlighter everywhere and she
got nowhere to play it no it just looks
so healthy so glowy and beautiful you
really genuinely do not need a
highlighter with it and yet it just
looks flawless yet again and it doesn't
break apart throughout the day I feel
like there's so many blushes I own that
when I put them on in the morning it'll
look pretty good but then by the end of
the day it'll still be ominous like
watch it and just make my cheeks with
red and weird and it's kind of spread
and this one same with the hourglass one
all three that I'm mentioning always
look beautiful by the end of the day too
and that's a big deal I mean why are we
putting on makeup in the morning if by
the end of the day we can't trust that
it's still going to look nice we wanted
to last them up nice all day so these
are two and the third one I'm going to
mention always beautiful by the end of
the day to the next blush is from ELF
again I know I sound like a broken
record if you've seen my ELF best and
worst video or talk about their worst
products they styles but also their best
I mention the foundation in this blush
but it's their studio blush which I've
tried so many shades and most of them
just aren't right for me like it'll be a
bright pink with glitter or you know
just I haven't found the right one until
I found this it's in the shade mellow
mauve and it's just this perfect kind of
peachy but also kind of pink toned blush
it has a little bit of a glimmer to it I
say glimmer because it's more like satin
it's not glittery at all there's not
really shimmer either but it's just
again a healthy glow do you see a trend
these all three looks so similar I
clearly know what I like but for all
three of these that are mentioning the
formula is amazing too so it's not just
the shade that's my favorite but is that
formula these stay on so well throughout
the day I've traveled with this more
often than I've traveled actually I
would say these two the hourglass and
elf are probably tied we travel honestly
like once a month and these two are tied
for the ones I travel with the most
because I love them both and I can trust
them almost done with face you have a
couple more face products this is my
favorite highlighter of the year this is
the Physicians Formula shimmer strips
all-in-one custom news palette for face
and eyes and this the packaging is cute
I mean it's not necessarily my favorite
packaging it's pretty bulky in the back
they've got some brushes you can use
with it but the idea is that you can use
as a highlighter or you can look at all
these little squares and use them as
different like eyeshadows and stuff I
even use it for eyeshadow yet although
you totally could but it's all together
swirled this gorgeous unbelievable
highlight it's kind of this I would say
peachy tone but if you focus your brush
more on the top you're going to get a
look to focus on the bottom it's going
to be deeper I mean we've seen lots of
products like these from Physicians
Formula over the years so it's nothing
new or groundbreaking anymore it's just
that this highlighter is so beautiful
it's a really smooth formula it glides
on you certainly can get heavy-handed
you want to be where I just really like
the way it looks
again I travel with this a lot which for
me is a testament to how much I like it
because I'm not going to travel with
something I don't love I don't trust I
don't think looks nice on me in that I
haven't tried for very long so this is
one that I really really like highly
recommend but for any of the positions
formulas cuz I'm recommending two
products from them wait for a sale
they'll do like buy one get one 50% off
sales or sometimes they'll just have
like 40% off of the whole line wait for
those to get these because otherwise
these can be kind of pricey for
drugstore in my opinion another face
product a more expensive one that I have
to mention is the hourglass vanish stick
foundations I don't know what the actual
needed you guys I have very dry skin and
I thought no freakin way
am I going to like this foundation stick
it is the creamiest weirdest thing I've
ever tried now I use it with their brush
and I have to say I think that it makes
me huge difference I don't think this is
great blended with your fingers Beauty
Blender no I tried other brushes but
there's something about the denseness
it's a very dense brush it's very
expensive though so I'm always torn I
mean I don't want to tell you to buy it
is because I worry that you wouldn't
like it I think if you have oily skin
you'll really like it because it's it's
so mattifying but even try skin what I
hope say about this is it if you have
dry skin you will see still see your dry
skin it's not a miracle worker but what
I love about it is when I know my photos
going to be taken with flash photography
so four different events I've gone to or
when I really want to look flawless on
camera I use this pretty much every time
what I'm using today
it just looks flawless I really do feel
like looking in the mirror it looks
flawless now I don't use this every day
because like I said it does accentuate
dry spots so you're still going to see
dry skin
and if you have it but it just is such
amazing coverage and you know you'll
I'll literally roll it up and the way I
apply it is
I'll just go swipe swipe swipe swipe
swipe swipe swipe dot and then I'll take
the brush and kind of pull blend it and
by doing that it just instantly spreads
covers my face completely I'll blend a
little bit on to you know kind of my
next path my chin and it just looks
amazing
you don't need another layer I've been
using it for a long time I hasn't run
out yet which kind of surprised me
because it's just the stick I use it in
the chef in the state shade shell that's
like saying Sally sells seashells by the
seashore I did it that was the first
time ever I've actually done it
correctly but I really really was so
impressed with this stuff so I had to
mention it it's expensive but I love it
one last base product unless I like
think of something else I need to add
last minute this is the only setting
powder that I found that I feel like
strongly about this is the Laura Mercier
loose setting powder and translucent it
is very high stuff on YouTube so I
finally like fell into the trap of
buying it and then I realized oh this
isn't a trap it's actually amazing which
I feel like 50% of the things other
youtubers recommend that I watch I love
and the other 50% I end up feeling like
now this is kind of trendy and everyone
likes it you know what I mean I'm sure
you guys know what I mean but this is a
great great product it does such a great
job of balancing between mattifying and
perfecting but also still being
breathable and looking like a human
being in person because for me I'm a
teacher I need to look normal in person
I'm not only in front of a camera
throughout the day it would be crazy
that would be like the Kardashian right
there in front of the camera off suffice
so for me I need stuff that doesn't just
look good on camera which a lot of
products look fantastic on camera but in
person you're like yo you that looks
crazy right this is one that strikes
that balance perfectly it you know it's
just got the sister this is just
translucent so it's kind of a one size
fits all kind of a shade but I just love
it it will
perfect but not too much I feel like a
lot of the ones I've tried are too much
in person they look fantastic on camera
so I like them for that but otherwise no
and this is one that I think is amazing
it comes with so much product I mean you
can just feel this one out but one ounce
of powder is like so especially a loose
powder that's really light is a lot of
powder it's worth it now I also bought
the puff I think you don't have to spend
the money necessarily on the public up
because it's really expensive and
frankly looking back on flight and I
spend money on that but you some body
puffs online that are just a nice bull
or puffs and it's a great way to apply
it it's probably the best way to apply
it all right let's move on to eyes the
pallets that are my favorite from the
year are going to shock you and I'm
being genuine sarcastic because these
blew me away and I have I don't
understand what the brand is I haven't
even looked up I haven't looked into the
brand at all to be honest and it's one
of those things that when I got it on my
go here's another palette in a
subscription box and then I tried it and
I was like this is amazing there's two
of them the brand is studio makeup and
these are their on-the-go palettes I got
both of these separately in two
different subscription boxes I think it
was boxycharm and so this one was the
first one I got and it was called warm
up now these are weirdly expensive I
don't know off the top of my head I'll
put it on the screen here very expensive
not unlike a lot of other pallets we all
buy and own and love or that you hear
about but you know for a grade you've
never heard of that you know the
packaging isn't fantastic it's just
magnetic kind of that cardboard feel
it's a lot of money but you know you can
always find sales and things like that
it came in the boxy charm and I'm like
oh my gosh the shape of this are so
beautiful and these shadows are so
unbelievably blendable smooth pigments
in all those words all those buzzwords
that that describe great eyeshadow
palettes this has and I love this as it
was because it has three shimmery shades
like a light gold a nice light kind of
rosy bronze and then a like kind of
yellowish gold and then I had all these
masks
perfect gradient of math then I got this
one and I was like oh my gosh so this
one's called cool down cool down cool
down I emphasize that weird and I love
this one too so it also has this one X
is for kind of five shimmers some of
them are kind of more satiny but it's
got this gorgeous deeper kind of
purplish tone here this gorgeous kind of
cool bronze tone and then again a
beautiful matte so when you look at
these side-by-side I thought oh my gosh
I don't need anything else I mean unless
you want some bright pops of colors
these don't have that but for neutral
looks and smoky looks and shimmery or
matte looks you can do so much with
these two and then you know thinking
about travel since that's a big part of
my life these are so thin they're sleek
they're you know I don't think they're
going to break anytime soon amazing
amazing products wait to see if you get
a sale or hopefully maybe it'll come in
a box of em for you I don't know Wow I
do need to look into this brand because
I was so blown away let's keep going
so the Mac Paint Pot is one of my
favorite just products generally I have
decluttered so many Mac products it's
crazy and it's not that I have anything
against Mac not at all it's just that
you know I feel like I went through a
phase where I bought a lot of Mac
products and a lot of them have just
gone bad because it's been a couple of
years but I love the prolongwear
concealer it's one of my favorites that
stands out a lot of the face products
break me out and I know that's true for
a lot of people and I know I haven't
really quite pinpointed what ingredient
it is and then that breaks me out but so
I've decluttered some blushes of theirs
and I'd love some of them I even wore
one of them I think I wore full of joy
on my wedding day so you know it's not
that I don't love them but this is one
of the few Mac products I still have in
my collection that I use all the time
that I like repurchase different shades
of because I love it that much and it's
their Paint Pot an Indian would this I
don't even remember like when I bought
this where I think I was in I might have
been in Disneyworld at there at Disney
springs one of the calls Downtown Disney
Disney springs and I think I saw the
shaving foam love but it's this gorgeous
bronze gold shade
I have been wearing this like I would
say two of five days every week when I'm
getting ready for work and I wake up
late you know one of those non shower
days or you dry shampoo your hair I'll
put this on my lid I blend it into the
crease and that's it well I mean I'll do
the rest of my makeup but for my eye
look I don't even pick up a palette or
anything because it just looks so
beautiful I can't believe how beautiful
this looks and a lot of the time I'll
get more compliments I wear just this
than I do doing a million other look so
I feel like one of those foolproof
shades that just looks nice and I don't
know if it emphasizes my eyes I have no
idea but I get a lot of compliments and
this is all it is and I think these are
like $20 ish might be a couple dollars
more but these lasts for me a very long
time and I don't know if they
reformulate it recently but I feel like
this is so much creamier than the other
ones I've recently bought I don't know
if it's the shade or what but Indian
wood is gorgeous if you haven't watched
it swatch it I can't recommend it highly
enough that is so beautiful and it stays
on all day does not budge so the next
eye product I want to mention is the elf
long-lasting webster's eyeshadow now the
formula of these is weird and I do think
it's kind of hit or miss I think that
some like I don't know but I have hit
pan on this I haven't hit pan on a
product I can't even remember the last
time I hit pan on a product and I just
got this a couple of months ago I wear
this all the time so which is kind of
whipped formula it's not like a color
pop shadow it's kind of similar but this
you like genuinely like kind of dig into
it to get the product but it's this kind
of creamy whipped product that this is
in the shade soirÃ©e and that's what my
favorite is not necessarily the product
line in general but this shade and my
friend another youtuber Carol Lago I'll
put her channel below she recommended
this to me and I fell in love with it
and it looked so beautiful on her
but it just is really pretty kind of
like burnt just kind of burgundy shade
it's got this beautiful glitter but I
love that the glitter doesn't get all
over your face because it's suspended in
this formula so it's not just loose by
any means
it's one of the only ways I can get
glitter on my eyelids without having it
also all over my face and that is why I
love this and also the shade just look
so nice if you've got brown or hazel a
greenish eyes it really emphasizes them
look so beautiful
I just love Shoji I can't figure out
this like turtleneck it's not right it's
comfortable but it's not right I have
too much Garrett's dimension oh my gosh
these are both so good let's start with
the drugstore this is the covergirl
super sizer I do not recommend something
if I don't 100% think it is amazing and
I have not found any drugstore mascaras
I felt like I loved like I feel like
ever like it is so rare I feel like I
try different vectors constantly I never
repurchase
I repurchase this like three times this
year that's how amazing it is
so I thought I would hate it I don't
usually like really weird like plasticy
wands I usually like the traditional
wands that are very volumizing well this
looks like it wouldn't be volumizing and
yet it is incredibly volumizing you can
kind of turn the brush to make it brush
through your lashes and get rid of any
clumps and then you turn it to a bare
spot of the wand to get more product on
it to make it more voluminous and then
you can turn it again and brush through
it so you kind of go back and forth and
it makes your lashes I mean it just
pushes them up so beautifully it holds
the curl now I will say this dot
outranked buy a more expensive one
however I don't love buying expensive
mascara because you go through em so
fast they only last you know an
expensive palette I can get down with if
I'm really interested because at least
it lasts you know a couple years but
mascaras looks like 3 to 6 months for me
typically like 3 to 4 I feel like after
that it's kind of weird but this it
cosmetics one is so good it's the it
cosmetics superhero one I know Emily
Noelle here on YouTube who I trust and
love so much also loves this and that
was actually I actually had it unopened
in my drawer and when she was talking
about how much she loves it I was like
ok it is time to bust that bad boy out
first time I used it I could not believe
how well my great my lashes looked I
mean they were just like boom
looks like I have fake glasses on now
today I do up fake glasses on so don't
let it fool you but I mean it was the
closest thing I've ever found a fake
glasses without actually wearing fake
lashes and this holds the curl better
than the covergirl one does but they I
like that the covergirl one kind of
brushes through this one doesn't
necessarily but I haven't really noticed
that it clumps too bad it clumps a
little because that's kind of what adds
the volume and it doesn't clump enough
that it bothers me you know there are
some mascaras that are just clunk pump
pump City and I cannot get down with
that but this one is amazing the brush
is very traditional I mean nothing
really special but I don't know what it
is about this formula but holy moly
I would I literally just like in the
mirror when I put it on I could not
believe it so this is one that if I were
to spend the money on a nice mascara I'm
not going to try a new one I'm just
going to buy this so they can't because
it's so good I mean just glowing reviews
all around amazing alright let's talk
about a quick nail one because I'm not
big on nails and then I've got a lot of
lists one these blew me away this year
these are the formula X so that's the
forest kind of nail brand it's their
shine XL and prime XL you put the primer
on then you put the nail color on any
brand it doesn't matter and then the
shine went on it holy moly
like I've never tried one as good as
this and I didn't think I would find one
that actually works I used to love the
Revlon ones but they're I feel like
they're not vain I know they like
discontinued it for a while so I bought
a bunch of them and then the formula got
kind of weird because I bought too many
backups and they were all going bad so
that's what I did I don't know what I
was thinking but these are so amazing
because you put on the primer and then
you put on the nail color I mean I could
put on a one dollar nail polish it stays
on for a week and you know you'll get a
little bit of PIP wear but not like
chunks coming out it's just like natural
tip wear but you won't get any like
weird chips I it is amazing I do think
you need both I don't think either one
on their own do the trick I really think
you need to spend the money to buy both
but they have completely transformed how
often I have to do my nails now giving
my nails a break right now they're a
mess in my suitable or a wintry mess but
amazing amazing products they're pricey
but I'm telling you it's worth the price
in the amount of time that you won't
have to spend taking your nail polish on
off and reapplying another one every few
days you know alrightlet's product this
is a long video my favorite lip balm of
the year it was a toss-up
but my favorite is this Hanalei let's
treat this I got this original one in I
think you know an Ipsy or something I
think it wasn't if see because then they
had a percent off discount and a lovely
subscribers sent me there there's from a
nips because they were going to use it
and so I've used that as well but let me
show you this whole thing so full-size
is humongous
look how big but I have these everywhere
they're so good I don't mention them a
lot of my channel because they are
pricey and so that's what kills me and
you got to order it like you can't
really order it from all over the places
by the one or two SS you can get it from
at least when I first originally ordered
this big one it is so amazing it smells
like a dream it feels like a little bit
thicker than petroleum jelly that kind
of consistency but it smells great my
lips have never looked better when I use
this i balance between a lot of
different lip balms because i've got a
lot of lip balms that i like but this
one really took me by surprise and it
was newer to me so I wanted to make sure
you need to know about it alright so my
favorite lip liner of the year and I
might literally tonight weld onto
colour-pop to buy more I don't get sent
things from colour-pop like I know a lot
of youtubers do I I think once I got a
couple things from them but never again
I think because I was like I think my
review was not glowing so I wonders that
was what I don't know eyes
you never know it is what it is but the
colourpop lip liners are unbelievable
they don't move they're incredibly
creamy the only qualms I have is that
they sharpened weird after a couple of
sharpening it just kept only sharp it's
just really weird but I still use it
like crazy and this shade is amazing
it's the shade bound I'm wearing it
today and it's one of those shades
that's a little bit deeper so you can
put a lot of different
with it and kind of create that ombre
lip I love the shade and I love the
formula and it's the first lip liner
that I found ever that I felt strongly
about because I feel like there were so
many lip liners out there half of them
are crappy half of them are great but
this one's excellent like it is a step
above
I've tried math ones I tried I guess
even tried a ton of high-end ones I've
tried like bare minerals ones and they
were kind of dry I've tried it cosmetics
ones and they were pretty good those
were better and they really didn't move
but again this one just blew everything
out of the water so I want to get other
shades if you already own some of these
and you have one you'd recommend I
really want to get a great red one like
a blue toned red so if you know a great
shade please let me know below because I
I really do think I'm going to play
somewhere maybe I'll wait and not do it
tonight so I can see what you guys say
no bizza
alright so the next product that I
discovered this year and they've been
around forever and something you guys
might roll your eyes but it's the ofra
liquid lipstick now stop not sponsored
I have tried probably 20 different kinds
of liquid lipsticks these are the best
period and the reason they're the best
is because they have an unbelievable
shade range they're you know a little
pricey you know they're not as cheap as
drugstore but you can get deals and
sales and things like that but it's the
formula they dry down but they're not
trying I've never found anything like
that I've tried to cap on d1 didn't like
him I was so sadly disappointed by those
because they dried out so much within an
hour that it looked crazy it looked
crazy these are unbelievable I have no
idea what they put in this to make it
look matte but still be creamy like you
can rub your lips together and it's
comfortable the only ones I haven't
tried that I know a lot of people love
are the anasazi one so I don't know if
those is similar to these I'm sure some
of you guys can let me know below if you
tried both because I do know a lot of
people love those as well I tried to
color pop one those in I said you like
those and they are cheaper so if you're
looking for maybe a cheaper alternative
go that route but these are absolutely
my favorite I'm so picky and I feel like
because I do have
day job I am I don't want to wear
lipstick unless it's going to look
awesome because I don't have time
throughout the day to reapply it I wish
I did but I do and it's so far from my
mind during the day so to have these in
my collection they're incredible they're
red that I love is called Atlantic City
I love this pink one called charms this
one called mocha it's just a smaller one
is actually the first one I tried just a
little trial one and I fell in love so
highly recommend but wait for like a
sale of some kind the last process I
mention are these maybelline color blurs
I feel like these don't get enough love
here on YouTube these are these they
almost are the size of a lipliner
they're thicker though a little bit
thicker and they have a bunch of
different shades and I love them because
they're the perfect everyday think
they're matte looking but they're
comfortable and they don't move because
they are kind of almost more like a
lipliner
I can't even say look line or texture
because these are the creamiest things
you'll ever try I mean unbelievably
creamy and pigmented it doesn't even
make sense you'd look at it they get to
be dry and it's not but it doesn't move
and it's comfortable it's one of the
best drugstore lip products that's come
through in a very very long time having
tried most of them love them they have a
great shade range I wish they had more
like peachy nude colors in this range
but amazing products so I forgot to film
an outro for this video so really
quickly I hope that you'll subscribe and
I hope you will catch me on my social
media there and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
