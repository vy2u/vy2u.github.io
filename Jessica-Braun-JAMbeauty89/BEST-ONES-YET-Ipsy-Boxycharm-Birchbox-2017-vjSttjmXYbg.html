old stack of subscription boxes to unbox
with you guys this month let's go and
get into it all right so one of these is
from last month I've got to figure out I
think I got my Birchbox late so I
couldn't put it in my January unboxing
if you haven't seen my junior unboxing
if you're interested I will link it so
let's quickly do that and then I've got
3 February boxes so for Birchbox $10 a
month I'll have links for all this stuff
below they had and they have the prices
so the first thing in here is this wish
shave cream and it says the full size is
$16 it's full size um I like lavender it
has a lavender scent did I say this is
full size guys I'm losing my mind
I'm absolutely losing my mind this is
not full-size but um this is the perfect
travel thing I don't have a travel shave
cream and you always need to shave your
legs like I feel like I'll go on a
cruise and I'm like I need something and
I don't want them even the travel size
of like the spray foam shaving cream is
still really big if you're carrying on
so this is perfect definitely we use
that next thing in here is a obliphica
Seabury hair serum and this the full
size is $38 and it says it's a
nourishing serum it revives damaged hair
without weighing it down use a few drops
on wet hair or on dry hair is the
finishing touch I do like using things
like this at the like when I'm done with
my hair just on the ends I'm just kind
of rubbing it between my hands and just
kind of working it through the ends and
I do feel like it it eliminates the need
for hairspray cuz it kind of holds my
hair together it gets rid of frizz so I
do like products like this that's pretty
nice next thing is from RN Co and it is
their Oblivion clarifying shampoo and
this the full size is $24 so this is
like a pricy shampoo now I will say I
like having clarifying shampoos and I
only use them like once a week but it is
really nice because you know when you've
been putting junk in your hair
especially like dry shampoo every other
day it's nice to just get it all out of
there once a week that's what I do so I
like that it's so I'm excited to try
different brand right now I have like a
Paul Mitchell one and I do like it again
like a full-size I'm never gonna run out
of it because I use it like once a week
but I'm excited I've heard a lot of good
things about RN Co so they also sent
like a little package of the Armco
oblivion restorative gel conditioner so
I figure it's meant to be used with that
so that's pretty cool um next thing is a
from B brow bar a brow bar and it's
their brow definer in cinnamon spice the
full-size and I'm sure this is the full
spot size is $25 that might work for me
actually I don't know that it will I
think it pulls a little bit too warm for
my brows and for what I like um it says
it's waterproof and smudge-proof though
with a natural matte finish it better be
matte or glossy eyebrows um so if it
were a good match that'd be pretty good
I'm curious if any of you guys got this
like did it did they pick different ones
depending on what you said your hair
color was I hope so anyway so okay I
might pass on to my sisters that lighter
hair I think that would be perfect so
the last thing in this one is the
audacity Odessa Tay skin care
supercharge your skin routine it's like
a tiny little vial it says it's a pimple
remedy all you need is a couple drops to
get remarkable result results uses a
spot treatment by massaging onto a
pimple that's pretty cool or supercharge
your daily dose of cream by mixing in
with this that's pretty awesome so
definitely in training on here alright
so that was January I'm gonna try and
move on cuz we got a lot to cover a long
one I hope you have some coffee or tea
or a Lacroix or something alright so
let's go ahead and do the Birchbox for
February cute little box so this one
looks way more exciting first thing in
here is from dr. lip and it's their
miracle balm the full size is 1650 it's
for dry skin lips I've had something
like this from them before it really is
moisturizing it does have like a glossy
finish it reminds me of the texture of
like Vaseline or even like the glossy a
bomb calm calm
no calm anyway but this does have a more
glossy finish so I like having this just
my purse is a quick bomb the next thing
is from Kula and it's their mineral
sunscreen that Kula makes they very
famous for their sunscreen because it is
more mineral based and it's just kind of
like better for you from what I've heard
I've used some of it I have liked it but
I'm excited to have a face one again for
travel because I use SPF each day but
it'll be nice to have one to bring with
me specifically for my face when I
travel the full size of this is $36 but
it says it's a matte mineral BB cream oh
oh it does have kind of like a yellow
color I'm sure it blends right in but
yeah but oh it does have like a silicon
mat feel to it and that is awesome
oh man I'm excited to try this because I
feel like every time I've tried to ski
like sunscreen for face it's always so
oily and it's like oh my gosh
so this is gonna be awesome to kind of
have a more mattifying one that's
expensive for the full size but if it's
awesome that would totally be worth it
alright next thing in here is this
obliphica so it's that same brand from
last month
Seabury mask well what what is the other
one oh the other was the Seabury hair
serum so this is a hair mask
for fine to medium hair that's Carly
about what I have full sizes $38 you
hydrate your strands from root to tip
it's full of antioxidants you put it in
damp hair leave on for 2 to 5 minutes
and rinse so it is a rinse out mask but
we'll definitely try that next thing is
a little lip product oh it looks like it
all got like smashed into it that stinks
part of me will always hate products in
packaging like this because I never
trust that the lids gonna stay on or oh
no the whole thing came out like there's
a little bit more it's getting
everywhere boo that stinks so let me
kind of press it in it's like a cinnamon
kind of color lip product it's really
pigmented oh that just stinks so I mean
and I don't think they could help that I
feel like that was just the way it was
just in shipping I guess but that
does stink um but that one is from the
beauty crop and it's the PBJ smoothie
stick in the shade saucy marsala and
that's $15 all right next thing is this
Notting Hill it came in this but it fell
out of that too must have been rough
shipping the Notting Hill femme is it
just oh I guess it's a perfume the full
size is 25 to 90 dollars for what huh so
it smells good um it's very like fresh
and musky it has like both going for it
the way they describe it is walk in the
garden bliss blending jasmine rose and
cyclamen with herbal green notes I would
greet that smells nice so I don't know
that I would necessarily buy a full-size
but I probably will use this up I'll
just set it on my little like perfume
tray in my bedroom so that was
everything for that month I think I
liked this month
February's this box a little bit more
than January's I think so let's open the
box each arm so this one is more
expensive it's $21 I've already peeked
you guys this month is amazing um would
you be my galantine so let's dive in the
first thing right on top is this omnia
eye kit and it comes with two different
brushes in here it's by royal and
langnickel and it's $30 for this but if
they're gold and rose gold brush we're
developed with the natural hair purist
in mind features meticulously selected
natural hair okay Bella it allows the
artist to precisely deposit powder
product to specific areas in the face
allows for perfect absorbency and
release for every application whether
powder liquid or cream Wow so they feel
pretty well made these are really pretty
definitely so see this one does not feel
this feels like synthetic hair no I
guess it is natural it has that
synthetic feel this one I'm going to
love to just pack on shadow all over my
lid this I'd probably use for either
like a wet product or on my lower lash
line so definitely going to use those
awesome next things are to makeup geek
Oh's yes so the original price for
makeup geek shadows are twelve dollars
and so I'm excited because I'm slowly
building up my little collection of them
this one's in the shade cherry cola and
it's like oh my gosh these shadows are
so so good
need i say more need i say more
and they blend so beautifully the next
shadow they gave is in prom night oh my
gosh this is like a deeper taupe oh my
gosh their shadows are so pretty now
here's the best part this is such a good
box this month it comes with a mini Z
palette oh my gosh like it's the perfect
travel size I could scream so it comes
with the little things you can put on
the back of Shadows if they don't
already stick but says boxycharm and z
palette and it's it's perfect I'm so
excited so this is amazing it looks like
you could probably almost fit nine
shadows sometimes you might not be able
to cuz you got to kind of offset them
but this is amazing total travel palette
for me to the max so exciting okay let's
keep going so it comes with a full-size
of the dr. Brandt microdermabrasion $79
are you serious so it says age defying
exfoliator it were new skin radiance
polishes and smoothes and helps diminish
the look of fine lines but yeah I'm so
I'm curious it says dampen skin with
warm water slowly and gently massage the
cream onto the skin for one to two
minutes rinse well pat dry best if used
one to two times per week
allowing three days between so I'm very
curious very very curious especially for
that price so the last thing in here is
from Juice Beauty this is insane
retail price $15 its they're reflecting
gloss in fig I've never tried any Juice
Beauty glosses so this looks like a kind
of peachy tone oh it's got like shimmer
in you swatch it again
can really see um it's a really pretty
like kind of deeper peach but it's got
this shimmer to it it does have like a
kind of nice scent
but kind of not fruity but just kind of
clean know kind of more fruity but it's
really pretty
it doesn't feel sticky it feels really
kind of comfortable so definitely going
to use that full-size that is freakin
sweet
so let's now so that boxycharm was
probably the best boxycharm I've ever
gotten ever I mean you got a full nice
lip gloss from a brand I know this
adorable Z palette - amazing makeup geek
shadows a full-size $80 dr. Brandt
microdermabrasion and these two brushes
like this this is what I wish every
subscription box for like this is
amazing totally worth $21 Wow um calm
down Jess it's just a makeup box so
let's open the Ipsy $10 Mon hate hate
hate this month's bag I saw it and I was
like I hate it I don't I don't like this
color denim as if that even matters but
the orange with it I absolutely hate I'm
sure some people like it I hate it calm
down Jessica it's just a makeup bag but
let's dive in so they never give their
prices but this is the venn effect
anti-aging lip treatment says this
deeply hydrating lip treatment reduces
prevents the appearance of vertical
lines while it softens and plumps
revealing a rosy glow that sounds pretty
cool all kinds of lines on my lips ooh
kind of has like a blistex texture if
you've ever used blistex totally has
that kind of a texture so I am very
curious to try this I'll have to let you
know because if that works that'd be
amazing
next thing is from trust-fund beauty it
looks like it's a nail polish they've
sent well one of them has sent us stuff
like this before from this brand and by
stuff like this I mean nail polish um
it's called I give good tweet and so
it's this really pretty like kind of
periwinkle color let's see how opaque it
is I haven't actually tried they've sent
one and I haven't try
the actual looks very opaque so that is
nice and it's such a pretty color so
that's pretty cool and it's certainly a
full size next thing is from Luna
it's the Luna highlighter curious ooh so
it's got nice kind of Mack like
packaging it's in the shade what Calypso
it looks almost like a grey tone whoa
look at that Wow
I have never seen a color like that from
is it meant to be like a genuine huh
yeah
baked highlighter that is so pretty
I can't wait to try this out so that is
awesome I see that gets me excited to
try new brands new products that I
wouldn't have tried otherwise Oh another
juice beauty they're hopping on this
subscription box bandwagon
it's the phyto pigments last looks
cream blush Jessica I think this might
be full-size pretty color right really
creamy very very glossy I like a glossy
cream blush I know not everyone does
it's a pretty natural peachy color so
I'm definitely going to try this just
with a stippling brush just onto my
cheeks um pretty packaging - wow like
really nice packaging so that's pretty
freakin sweet last thing is from NYX and
it's their butter lipstick definitely
full size it's in the shade ripe berry I
used to like their product like this in
the shade hunk ooh I do like this color
though that is so pretty these are
really creamy lipsticks I will say
they're not going to stay in place all
day you definitely want to lipliner with
them but they really are pretty and
comfortable so that was probably one of
the best if seas I've ever gotten
full-size nail polish full-size lipstick
might as well be a full-size highlighter
that's beautiful
probably full-size cream blush from a
really good brand and then this lip
product that I'm so curious about if it
gets rid of lines even though I hated
the bag I loved the contents inside so
awesome like I feel rejuvenated with the
like subscription boxes that are out
there because I've started to kind of
feel like mmm but this like
be excited again so if you enjoy
