to bring you my top Sephora
recommendations I was going to do top
ten but I ended up having more than ten
so I'm like oh my gosh forget it but
these are my favorite products ones that
I love there's a little bit of skincare
we got a lot of makeup so let's go and
get into it so this year at Birth Vegas
is actually this little mini set of two
of my favorite products and this video
happens to be sponsored by coda way
which I am so excited about because I
love so many of their products and their
vino line of skincare I'd love for a
while but these were two of the most
standout products when I found out it's
gonna be the birthday gift
I've already fits perfect perfect so in
it you get the vino source sorbet which
is the best moisturizer I have the
full-size here I've been using this for
a while now and what I love about it is
it has this gel cream texture that
really quickly absorbs into the skin so
when you're getting ready in the morning
you can put this on that's the way I've
been using it and it sinks in quickly
and then you can get to putting your
makeup on you don't have to waste any
time waiting but I'd also been using it
at night I have noticed the redness in
my skin I usually have less redness my
cheeks or my nose the redness have gone
down so much I feel like the second I
put this on whether it's right after a
shower or maybe at night I just noticed
that my skin is so much more even and
less red and I love that so that's one
of the free birthday gifts and then the
other one in there is the Vino perfect
radiance serum and it's complexion
correct so the small one you get is in
here it's still like a decent size
though and I love this to narrow it to
travel with it
perfect this one is a huge cult favorite
this one I think they said that one of
these is sold every single minute isn't
that crazy so it's a best seller of
theirs but for good reasons so if a
serum you put on before your moisturizer
after you clean cleaned your face and it
just has that medicine dropper oh I love
about it is I feel like it really boosts
the radiance in my skin it just it makes
my skin look so much less dull and just
so much more alive and that's why I've
been loving it and these two paired
together I feel like my skin is more
radiant more evened out less red than
ever and moisturize so I'm just in love
and I'm just
that everyone can get their hands on
this and get to try it for the birthday
issue
awesome so those are my first two moving
on to a ton of makeup
we'll start with like face products my
next recommendation is this Becca
backlight priming filter this is one
that I have to admit I was very on the
fence about a month how you know how is
that going to make that much of a
difference but I think the reason I like
it is because it bridges the gap between
being just like a straight-up liquid
highlighter and being something that's
not luminizing y'all it's almost as if
you mix a regular primer with
illuminizer and you get this beautiful
thing and at first it looks like it can
almost be a targeted highlighter but
when you blend it out it gives your face
the most beautiful glow it feels
moisturizing I don't know if it actually
is moisturizing to be honest with you
but I haven't really tried a primer that
does what this does so that's why I
wanted to share this in this video I
know a lot of people been talking about
this they talked about the purple Becca
one I haven't tried that one but this is
the one I'm really really liking you
would totally recommend and it's going
to last for a long time and of course
you could also mix this in with your
foundation if it is like maybe a really
high coverage heavy foundation this
would be a great way to kind of lighten
it up a little bit to play the next
product I couldn't do this video without
recommending is the milk makeup glare
stick again I'm waiting for other
companies to come out with something
like this for cheaper and if you know of
any please let me know because I've got
primers that do a similar thing but
they're like a cream or a liquid but I
really like this because it's so quick
and so I usually just put it anywhere I
need my pores filled like my nose may be
a little bit up here depending on the
day but I just noticed it's so amazing
you can even put it on your under eye to
kind of fill the fine lines it kind of
helps I don't notice like a huge
difference with that but I do notice a
huge difference when I do it on my nose
and it like even my chin sometimes so
totally recommend if you have poor
problems if you don't you probably don't
really need this but and again this
gonna last me a very long time
continuing on his face what do we have
this is number five I have these RMS
Beauty cream highlighters so my original
prankster that I loved was the Living
Luminizer and
have it on today it is the most it's
like a creamy gloss almost but it's not
sticky by any means and it's not really
glossy that's not really doing right
word but it's just this really thin
layer it's not opaque it's very seeker
but you can pat it in those areas you
want to highlight even on the tip of
your nose and it's just so beautiful now
living Luminizer is more of a white
pearly face and the other one I have is
master mixer which is a little bit more
golden but these are just so stunning I
mentioned in my travel makeup bag video
which I can link below
I mentioned bringing this to Vegas
because we went to a pool party and I
still wanted to wear some makeup and so
this is all I ended up putting on my
face other than like a BB cream because
it just ended up looking so glowy but
not powdery by any means so I think it's
a great summertime highlighter both of
them are and I would say the living-room
knives was probably better if you have
lighter skin like I do in maybe master
mixture if you have a little bit deeper
or if you just like a certain tone
better and you can determine it that way
my next product is one I have not talked
about a lot of my channel but I've been
using for awhile and it is the Bobbie
Brown corrector and light bisque this is
this very you know peachy olive apricot
color corrector they have a lot of
Darkness just right here and right here
and I know a lot of us do and so for me
I would have these high coverage
concealers that are really brightening
and I mean I've been doing this for
years I put it all over blend it in and
my fellow looks nice and light and
bright but I would still like see myself
in photos or catch myself in the mirror
and see those shadows it's not like man
like I've got this crazy eye coverage
concealer on and yet I can still see
that darkness there and that's when I
discovered products like this and this
specific one it's so amazing because
when you put it on I want to put it on
so bad I love applying this I'm not
wearing today so if you can see some
shadows that might be why but it's just
this gorgeous color that I usually only
put in that region
I don't I'll use a regular concealer
down here but again if you do a dark
circles like purplish bluish tones this
is amazing for that
it blends in so seamlessly even just
with your finger I think I've done it
with a beauty blender as well but I
think I like it that's just with my
finger cuz it blends so quickly with the
heat of your hand and it just stays in
place all day
it totally cancels out that
discoloration and then you could go on
top of that with the concealer or life
for me I just leave that part alone and
then I do ready to concealer down there
so either way I love this stuff like
this I'm not sure how many shades they
have but like this seemed to be the
perfect one for that purpose so I loved
my next recommendation is what's on my
lips and these are the smashbox always
on liquid lipstick based on either whole
collection a long time ago and i
actually got rid of all of them but
these group but these two just because i
wasn't going to get out of them i knew
like my sisters would enjoy them so the
one i'm wearing right now is called babe
allure and it's funny because in that
casing it looks I think lighter than it
actually is when you put it on your lips
but it just got cute small packaging
it's got a triangular doe foot
applicator really easy to apply I didn't
use a lip liner at all with them the
other shade I really like is called
always on nope the other shade I really
like it's called on demand and this one
is lighter than what I'm wearing it a
little bit more peachy gosh it almost
looks the same let me put baby literally
yeah these are very very close I always
forget how close they're so babe allure
is a little bit more cooler toned or
maybe just a little bit deeper and then
the other one is a little bit lighter
but they are very very close in tones
they're like a liquid lipstick in that
they dry down but it's almost like a
satin finish and not like a massive you
know what I mean now are these gonna
last for hours and look perfect after 5
hours no you'll need to reapply them but
for me I don't mind doing that because
it is comfortable to apply and I'm kind
of getting out of that liquid lipstick
phase I think a lot of us are just
because our lips can't handle it it
doesn't end up looking good after a
while but these are just pretty and
comfortable and really easy to reapply
throughout the day as well so that is
why I was recommending my next product
is another milk makeup product and when
I was compiling these products for this
video
I listen like how do I have to milk
makeup products but I think what they're
so good at is they don't have a huge
line of makeup but what they do have
it's really well thought out really well
made and they're just great products and
that I really appreciate and these you
have to if you've been watching my
channel for a while you probably knew I
was going to recommend these but these
are the milk eye pigments they are a
cream shadow tube and they're just so
beautiful so my favorite I have a lot of
favorites but this one's called after
party and I show it all the time I know
I sound like a broken record but if you
haven't tried them yet you would
understand why they're just like the
most stunning ridiculous
shear key totally opaque they have crazy
bright colors totally neutral colors
stuff in between and I just love them so
totally recommend they stay on all day
what I usually do is I'll take it and
just Pat it onto my eyelid and then grab
a brush to blend it into the crease and
usually that's it but I can also you
know maybe do some other shadows in the
crease but they're just so beautiful on
their own they would totally work as a
shadow base as well if you found a color
that you knew you would use a ton that
would be perfect
another recommendation is honest obvious
dip brow pomade this has been around for
a while and I feel like people use when
it first came out people were talking
about it so much and then it kind of
fizzled but I don't really know why it's
fizzled because it is so amazing and
it's it is the best eyebrow product I
own I own a lot of them and I love a lot
of them but this is the one like I use
it on my eyebrows today every time I use
this I feel so much more put together I
feel like my brows look so much better
so much more even the pigmentation is
not weird you know you can get into thin
areas you can get into thicker areas
it's just so weirdly natural-looking and
that's what I think is crazy about it
because when I first heard about brow
pomade what is so intimidating to me
because I thought about putting that
dark color all through my brows but what
I do is I'll just dip a thin brush in it
wipe off a good amount of it onto like
that I usually have just like a little
wash buff
I'll wipe off a lot of it onto that and
then I'll start working it
eyebrow and then I'll use the spoolie to
comb through and it just looks so nice
and natural and soft and so that is why
I had to recommend it I feel like it's
such a boring thing to recommend like a
brow product but if you have trouble
with your brows and you haven't tried
this try it even if it's intimidating to
you because it definitely was for me I
wear the shade medium brown it's I
really liked it because it did not pull
red at all so and it can totally I could
pile it on and be way darker I don't
know that it would go much lighter than
the way I applied it to be honest with
you but I love it so so much and this
pot is going to last me forever I mean
it's totally worth the investment and I
found other drugstore brow pomade to be
pretty good like L'Oreal is a pretty
good one but I do feel like the anasazi
ones are just a little bit creamier and
easier to work with I'm talking just a
little bit but there is a difference so
you don't have to fork over the money
for it but if you're just like dying to
try it and you know you'd like it or if
you're like you know what I'm just going
to do it do it because you will love it
I ran out of this one my hourglass 1.5
millimeter mechanical gel eyeliner again
I'm a broken record this stuff is so
amazing it's like the thinnest
retractable brush I can't it's literally
out yeah so anyway but it's so amazing
and highlighting it's so creamy stays on
all day you can use it in your waterline
it's amazing it is the I can't say
enough good things about it I wish it
were cheaper they do have three packs
which i think is what I'm gonna have to
buy next they keep saying that I just I
was buying an absolutely amazing black
eye
I'm going to mention a blush that I
think has been long forgotten from
Sephora and it's the benefit Dallas
blush I used to have all the benefits
I've gotten rid of all of them except
for this one this is one of my Holy
Grail blushes I travel with it all the
time and it'll be the only blush I bring
because it's so natural looking on
skintone you don't obviously this is not
going to work for every skin tone but if
you're anywhere in your mind you would
love it
and it's not to say the other box
blushes aren't good they're all really
good but I thought if someone didn't
last very long or it just wasn't right
for my skin tone some of them are really
like bright peaches a lot of glitter and
it just didn't look good on me but this
does have a shimmer but it's more of
like a almost brown neutral and I know
that looks buy so boring when you put it
on your cheeks it's just such a nice
flush and you can kind of what do they
call that the draping method where it's
kind of with a blush bronzer in one it's
just so amazing if I ran out of it I
would buy it again it's all my makeup is
stolen I would buy this again I mean
just I loved it so much I'm going to do
a couple of quick honorable mentions
they could easily have been in this but
I want to mention it anyway the this one
is the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
I know a lot of people really like this
some people are just like a mess I
really like it because we if you take it
and you take the paddle and you just put
it all over the place and then blend it
with a Beauty Blender it's just so
natural looking but still really
brightened and I like that about it I
don't notice that it creases as much as
other concealers now I've never found a
concealer that doesn't crease in some
capacity into my fine line but this
stuff is just really nice and if you're
ready to take this step up from
drugstore concealer and you want one
that great for everyday that's not too
much like I love my Kat Von D in my tart
shaped cake but sometimes that can be a
little bit too much for every single day
this is what I end up using most
mornings I just love it I so enjoy using
it and I feel like it looks just as
fresh and brightened at the end of the
day when I'm done teaching another
honourable mention the NARS audacious
lipsticks this is the only shade I used
to have another one but I can't find it
but this one's in Raquelle it's so
beautiful but this formula is so creamy
if you haven't tried them or at least
swatch them maybe in store oh my gosh
are you in for a treat they are so so
luxurious so creamy so okay like it's
kind of totally in a league of its own
I like this
I like my Marc Jacobs ones but the Marc
Jacobs ones are they're very famous they
stay in place and I love them so much
you guys know that but they are a little
bit drier to apply
whereas this just glides right on
another honorable mention my Stila stay
all day waterproof liquid liner I talk
about all the time that's all nice day
the felt-tip it's really black it is
waterproof I tested it in the water and
it lasts I can make that video down
below last honorable mention is my Laura
Mercier translucent loose setting powder
I love it it is amazing for baking if
you like that it doesn't show up in
flash photography I've tried to cover FX
one and I did a comparison side-by-side
of this and that new cover effects
perfect setting powder and they're both
really really good but you get way more
product with this one like way more for
the price and I think it was like triple
the amount and that crazy and I think I
like this just a little bit better I use
it every single day I don't necessarily
bake every single day but I do just
apply a light layer all of my face to
set my foundation so then I can put on
bronzer blush whatever and it's not
getting stuff too tacky parts of my
foundation this kind of sets everything
before I put on anything else and it
makes my makeup last like literally all
day so those are my tops before
recommendations for the moment and I
hope that you enjoyed I hope you learned
something new so other than that I hope
that you will subscribe and in the
meantime come say hi on my social media
