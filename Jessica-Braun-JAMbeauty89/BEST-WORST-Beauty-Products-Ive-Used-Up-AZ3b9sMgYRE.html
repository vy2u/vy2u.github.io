share with you my empties so these are
all products that I finished and frankly
I'm having to do these more often which
is awesome because I love watching these
videos because it tells you what have
youtubers used and how did they really
feel like it feel about it I'm hungry I
can't even think straight you guys
anyway so I'm excited to share my
thoughts some of these are kind of
regrets some of them are loves and some
of them are kind of mess so we will go
through them all let's start with this
one this one's not completely empty I'm
gonna finish it back up but I grabbed it
from my bathroom because I was like it's
gonna be done in the next like week so
it'd be silly to save it for the next
go-around when I could just talk about
it today and I freaking love it so this
is from belief it's their true cream
moisturizing balm I had heard other
people talk about this and say that if
you have dry skin it is balm well it
freaking is the bomb it's so good the
first few times they used it I was like
I don't know you know it just feels kind
of like a normal like cream you can't
really um and it has this kind of smell
that's it's a very fresh smell but it
says the moisture lasts up to 26 hours
dermatologically tested it has comfrey
leaf Napier's moisture formula formuler
oh my guys anyway so this stuff my skin
is so moisturize and I use it I love
putting it on at night and then like
it's you know usually the last step in
my skincare regimen and I look in the
mirror before heading to bed and I'm
like yeah my skin is very happy right
now that's literally how I feel every
time so really really really great
moisturizer would I repurchase
absolutely now I do have in my little
like skincare backup drawers the same
thing but it's their Aqua version so I
want to try that as well and I'll have
to let you know maybe a comparison of
the two but I was really impressed with
totally this is something I bought
during the during Christmas over
Christmas they had like a sale like a
set or something like that this one is
really good and it's really
it's the Bumble and Bumble Preta powder
train visible dry shampoo I freaking
love it it smells great it works better
than any dry shampoo I've used I've used
some really expensive ones like right
now I'm using an Oscar blondie one that
one's expensive I've used some really
cheap ones the best cheap ones I found
are the batiste ones but this blows it
out of the water it's a completely
different formula is the thing and so
when you spray this in your hair I'll
let it you know I'll spray it towards
the roots and I'll let it sit for a
while maybe a minute or two and then I
just use my fingers no white casts
anymore when you do that I don't feel
like I have to brush it through smells
amazing my hair is like volumizing
but it also doesn't like completely dry
my hair out it's the weirdest thing so
I'm going to end up repurchasing this I
know I know I am and it's expensive and
I wish it wasn't but I know that I'm
gonna because it's the best one I've
ever tried this is a hair product I'm
done with and you can see that there's a
lot left I'm passing this on to my
sister I already told her about it this
is the way haircare wave spray I just my
hair doesn't mesh well with waves phrase
my hair is naturally wavy so when I let
it air dry it ends up being wavy on its
own so when I add in something like this
it doesn't for me end up holding the
waves together any better it just makes
them sticky and I don't really like the
smell of this which oh no this one this
is the one that smelled okay it was that
other way one the the way memory mist
that I can't smell I can't say the smell
this actually did smell good very clean
but it says it's a weightless texture
mist for efforts effortlessly chic
undone hair with rice protein to add
hold in memory for that just got out of
the ocean look didn't do that for me
just made it sticky and almost frizzy in
a way that if I had put nothing in my
hair it would have looked better but
that's my hair I know a lot of people
love this I would bet it'd be nice
especially if you had like a little bit
shorter hair or maybe if your hair
wasn't naturally textured at all it
might actually give it the texture you
want but if it already is I think it's
too much this I love I've gone through
more than one of these this is the Brio
Gio Rose Arco blow-dry perfection and
heat protectant creams so I will when
I'm gonna blow dry my hair which I don't
do everyday or every time I shower that
is
but when I do I would squirt this and
just kind of run it through all of my
hair really focusing mostly on the
bottom portion but I put it all
throughout and I do feel like it's doing
a good job I feel like my hair you know
freshly after it's cut I feel like when
I'm using this religiously it looks so
much less damaged it doesn't look as
damaged as quickly does that make sense
you know once you get close to needing a
haircut you just no but I feel like this
is helping keep it healthier for longer
down there like at the ends of the roots
and I like that and briault Gio I always
talk about because they don't put any
yucky stuff in their formulas and I
really appreciate that this was an
interesting one this is the new knee and
this brand I'm trying a lot of their
stuff like right now I'm trying a new
knee like lip oil thing and it's like
not as oily as you'd think it's all of
their products are like just a little
bit different than I envisioned but this
is their deep cleanse snowflake jelly
cleansing oil this I liked do I think
I'm gonna go run out and repurchase this
no because I didn't like this more than
my Clinique take the day off
cleansing balm so what it is it's a
thick almost like think of it like
coconut oil that kind of texture kind of
a balm
this is a little thinner than that's not
as hard to make emollient but anyway and
you just put it on a dry face it starts
to break down your makeup and then you
use water to kind of remove it and then
you go in with a regular cleanser that's
my preferred way to take off makeup I've
been doing that for probably a year year
and a half and I really like it I feel
like it's helped my skin a lot well this
removed makeup okay it didn't do as well
I'm like stubborn eye makeup which
really not all of them do and I'm okay
with that because I don't usually use
waterproof makeup anyway but if I've got
like lash glue on like if I'm wearing
fake lashes oh my gosh nothing gets that
crap off and that's why I like I wear
fake lashes just so rarely even in
filming I don't wear them very off like
I'm not wearing today because I'm like I
can't do it like it's so much work to
get it off and then I feel like I'm
losing my own lashes I'm like this is
not worth it anyway
it was good not gonna buy again cuz I
think there's better stuff out there but
it was nice oh this is a Tyler my
husband empty this is from every
man-jack
and it's their fiber cream we bought
this because it was on
Clarence at like Target or Meijer
somewhere
he couldn't even finish it up he said I
am done and I what dude I do not blame
you
he really likes the American Crew like
pomade is that the pomade or maybe it's
their fiber stuff he loves that because
it doesn't have shine but it really does
add hold he said this stuff was
literally and I would see it in his hair
he would it's a really really thick
thing and maybe that's how the other but
he said no matter how much I would rub
it between my fingers I would always
have these little white specks all
throughout his hair and he would I would
see it I'm like dude what's going on um
it was just terrible he was like I've
tried a thousand ways to make this work
and I can't and Tyler is not someone
that gives up on things like he will use
the product that he hates all the way to
the end but this one was so bad he was
like I am done so he's back to his
American Crew fiber stuff and this stuff
is on the way out oh I love this stuff
there's maybe a little bit more I can
try to squeeze out this is the village
Naturals therapy aches and pains
nighttime relief you can find this most
places drugstores I love this I've
already bought it again I'm halfway
through my next one it is so good you
know I'm yes I'm pregnant
but I liked this even when I wasn't
because it really you put it in the bath
and of course it makes bubbles but it
just eases your muscles and you can kind
of smell it and it relaxes you it's so
wonderful I think they have an aches and
pains one that's not nighttime as well I
love it
and it says you can use as a body wash
as well but otherwise it's a bath oil
that's the dr. teals I go through these
like crazy so pure Epsom salt they have
different versions of their Epsom salt
this is their soften and nourish with
milk and honey I like to use this often
a nurse in the winter just because you
know our skin gets so dry if you live in
a climate where you've got the heat on
inside right now I bought I'm going
through I think it's like the kind of
relaxed muscle relief kind of a one that
I'm using but I really do like this one
too and again these are relatively
inexpensive compared to you know you can
get bath salts that are ridiculously
pricey but these I think are reasonable
and the packaging of this is velcro
it's genius it's so genius anyway love
it went through an elf Cleansing Cloths
I've got another one I think I'm almost
through these are just okay I bought a
few when I place an order online months
ago and I use them for swatches I don't
use them on my face not that I think
there's anything wrong with doing that
again I just it's not my preferred way
of removing makeup now have I used these
on my face yes and it was just fine
like if I put on a foundation I'm like
Boop that looks crazy I'll usually grab
one of these to take it off and it does
a great job removing do I think this
will be absolutely amazing for like I
makeup no because there are times where
I'll have like a liner swatch and I'm
like and I cannot get that liner even
off of my hand so I can only imagine in
that tender eye area this I have like a
teensy bit left in the bottom this is
the volition turmeric brightening polish
this was nice Volition's the cool cool
brand and they sent me a bunch of their
stuff a long time ago because what they
do is they take ideas from us you know
not from you too I mean from one anyone
and you know if you've got an idea or a
recipe in your life I really think this
would be a great product there's a
chance that they might take you up on
that and so like whoever invented this I
think there was like a little card and
with it like explain their story or who
came up with this idea but it was nice I
do I think it genuinely brightened my
skin I don't know it definitely
exfoliated especially of my elbows and
things cuz it has like little tiny
granules in it it says that you're
supposed to massage it onto wet skin and
leave it on for two minutes by then
usually it was already rinsed off
because I'm in the shower you know what
I mean so but I liked it would I go out
and buy it I don't think so I think
there are plenty of other exfoliator
--zz for cheaper right now I'm using a
coffee one from Shea Moisture that I
really like now it makes my shower a
mess but I love coffee scrubs alright I
have a brand I'm done with this is the
organics or OGX brand I keep buying
their stuff and I keep not liking it I
don't know what's going on why do I keep
buying I've bought so freakin many of
their shampoos and conditioners this
goes like back to when I used to live in
Chicago way before I had a youtube
channel I have tried so many of their
products and all of them dry my hair all
of them it's Hort like to the point
where it's very noticeable to me
in the shower I'm like ah it and this is
their brunette one I used it for a while
I'm gonna see if a sister maybe wants it
I'm gonna tell them though like hey I'm
just letting you know this is terrible
but do you want it
sometimes like y'all try it okay it's
just bad all of their part and I don't
know what is going on because OGX you
think yeah it says Beauty pure and
simple so you think oh it's gonna have
good ingredients well I guess not I
don't know I don't know what's going on
with my hair versus this stuff now I've
tried some other hair spray products
those are usually better like I've tried
some of their dry shampoos those are
better but their shampoos and
conditioners I'm done with I'm not
trying anymore
oh I mentioned this last time and so
many of you guys were like that stuff is
life-changing
it's the clearcare 3% hydrogen peroxide
contact lens cleaner I get makeup on my
contact lenses i i'm just notorious for
I'm horrible with contact lenses
well I'm better about them now because
of this stuff so you put it down in this
little like container and the thing is
if you put it in your eyes after like an
hour or two of it being in there it will
literally burn your eyes like it is the
worst pain ever if you've ever
accidentally done it you can't put it in
a regular contact lens so there's some
scientific magic going on that you can't
mess with and I think it's like after 4
to 6 hours you can use it and it's done
and then it's fine to put your eyes I
don't know what in the world but it
cleans my lenses like crazy I use it
every single night my lenses are lasting
just as long as normal it's not doing
anything freaky they usually sell big
double packs that like Costco so that's
usually what I when I get because we
both use them and this stuff is amazing
and I have heard that you guys were
telling me Walmart makes a knockoff
brand so I'm like I bet a cheaper all
right
oh the LA fresh or love fresh travel
light oil-free makeup remover wipes I
almost use these up and then the last
few dried up on me I use these when I
travel they're okay they're just okay
I'm on a pronamel kick I have horrible
enamel I like as a kid I got cavities
even as an adult I get cavities so
easily and my dentist has told me like
your enamel really is weak and that's
kind of something in my family they're
kind of
so I'm trying to be better and use
better toothpaste port for it because I
loved using like crest 3d white like I
feel like it would make my teeth so
white but anyway I've been using
Sensodyne pronamel for I don't know
maybe a couple months now and I'm like
well my teeth are still white I don't
think feel like it's not whitening them
this one was more expensive though and
it's they're strong and bright enamel it
was okay I ended up just going with the
the standard Sensodyne pronamel with
like whitening because again they had it
at Costco for like a four pack so that's
what I'm using and I really like it my
breath still feel smart fresh but I at
least feel like okay you're actually
taking care of your teeth just because
having white teeth is not as important
as like having strong teeth so I'm like
I've got to like prioritize what's
important bio-oil
I've used up and I'm halfway through my
next one I use on my tummy in addition
to other oils things like that I mean so
far so good this is another Tyler one
it's the Kota Lee vine active overnight
detox oil this stuff smells like actual
but it what is it funny to hear someone
say the word but that we're alone is
funny to me anyway it does smell like
butt and Tyler was like yes I agree
it smells like butt oh it's okay it
doesn't actually mic but it just smells
really bad
this stuff is he freaking loved it
though he was like you have any more
that I'm like no oh there's a little
tiny bit so you would use it at night
pretty much every single night and even
though it smells horrible he really
really liked it and I've heard this is
like an award-winning like amazing
product says apply six drops in the
evening either alone or before your
moisturizer avoid your eyes so anyway I
will say the code early products I've
tried I've really liked like I like a
lot of their skincare so you know I'm
sure it really was good this was one
that this is from drunk elephant they'd
sent me a lot of their products a while
ago and I'm kind of slowly trying them
this is their Lala retro whipped cream I
do think it's moisturizing it's got this
weird it's good though I mean it's
hygienic in my opinion but a pushdown
thing where it comes up through the top
I wondered if it
use it all it actually completely
empties it out that's awesome so here's
the thing
drunk elephant products are really
expensive now most of their ingredients
are incredible really truly I just
didn't really care like I would much
rather use my belief moisturizer I've
enjoyed that so much more than this this
is a very almost dry feeling moisturizer
whereas the belief has almost like a gel
like texture I can't explain it this
might have been doing great things for
my skin but I didn't like using it does
that make sense so I don't know
I don't would I go out and buy it I
don't think no I know that I wouldn't
because I'd much rather spend my money
on the belief stuff I'm trying out other
dry elephant trunk elephant stuff that
I'm really enjoying and I'm kind of
working on a video some skin care based
videos I'm kind of working on as I
gather my thoughts they get cosmetic
superhero mascara I used up this stuff
is amazing it's expensive though I would
say buy the essence lash princess
mascara over this I can link it below if
you're curious about like which one
because there are a couple it's
literally a fourth of the price and it's
exactly the same thing it does the same
thing for my lashes I really like this
but and I think I even have some in my
backup drawer but the lash princess
stuff is the same thing and it's cheaper
oh my goodness this is my Sunday really
good jeans little trial sample that I
bought at Christmas time this stuff is
so expensive now you need to know that I
about threw up because Sunday Riley sent
me it a good way I threw up like in a
good way they sent me a couple of their
products and part of it was the good
jeans and I was like sweating my litters
like Tyler do you remember that one
skincare product that when I was using
it I was telling you this stuff is
amazing but it's like $100 for the full
size and I was like I don't want to run
out but I freaking love it and I might
buy it I'm just letting you know he was
like yeah vaguely I'm like well they
just sent it to me and I'm literally
about to barf this stuff is so good it's
an exfoliator but you know you it looks
like almost like a moisturizer and you
put it on and it does its work overnight
I always use it at night you can
probably use it during the day but with
the exfoliator zand things I am always
like because you might want to use this
SPF with it too and so I usually just do
it at night but it says it's an
all-in-one lactic acid treatment and
deeply exfoliates for clarity radiance
younger looking skin visibly brightens
dark spots instantly plumps the look of
fine lines and wrinkles I don't know
about plumping the looks of fine lines
and wrinkles but I do know that my skin
every morning after using this and I
wouldn't use that because I didn't want
to run out of it I'd use it like twice a
week my skin the next morning would look
like heaven it was this stuff is
freaking ridiculous I love it worth the
price I was genuinely gonna bite myself
so when should they sent it I was like
okay then I have this pie shell biphasic
infusion rejuvenating concentrate it's
just like a hair oil I liked it I I'm
not sad that it's done I was kind of man
I've been mentioning recently that I
really am on the hunt for a really good
hair oil cuz I don't feel like I found
one that I feel that strong I found some
good ones but I don't feel like I found
one I'm like oh my gosh this stuff is
amazing so if you have any
recommendations please let me know down
below but this was good it wasn't bad so
those were all of my empties for this
I guess month if you want to see my last
month's empties I'm saying like month in
quotes because I'm like I don't it's not
really every month but it kind of is
becoming that I will link it below and
if you enjoyed I hope you'll subscribe
and hit that notification bell so you
are notified when I upload new videos
and other than that I'll see you guys in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
