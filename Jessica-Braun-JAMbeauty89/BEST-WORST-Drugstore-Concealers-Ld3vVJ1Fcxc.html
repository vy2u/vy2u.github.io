weird I'm going always wave with my
right hand I don't know how to do it
over here hey guys hey guys hey yeah
okay I bet I could do like every
youtuber i watch I could do like all of
their interest all of their intros like
hey guys who is that eleventhgorgeous
how does Tashi do it she was good hey
guys couldn't you guys like do
everyone's and I bet a lot of you guys
to do like my outro to anyway ah I love
YouTube okay so I have 15 drugstore
concealers in my collection I did not
realize how many concealers generally
because that means I have even more
concealers just total but I currently
have 15 in my collection that are
drugstore assuming I counted correctly
and I'm now thinking there might be one
in my bathroom
let me go check sixteen I found another
one who knows this is awesome so I'm
going to give many reviews of every
single concealer that I have that it's
drugstore I've been doing these for a
while now I really like doing them and I
wish more youtubers did them because
it's a great way for you guys to see
what all I own if you're ever wanting
like a more in-depth review but also
it's a really quick way to find out like
what concealers should you run out and
buy if you're in need of a concealer
like what's one of these that sounds
like it's right for your skin type or
skin tone or you know whatever it might
be so I don't even know where to start
some of these are getting older and so
I'm excited to tell you guys about them
and my thoughts because they really are
probably needing to be trashed so I'm
going to show you many reviews of all
now 16 of these concealers I'm also
going to show you swatches so you can
get an idea of what the formula looks
like things like that so if you enjoyed
this style of video I've also done one
on my drugstore bronzers drugstore
foundations I want to say I've done
maybe one or two other ones so I will
link those below if you are interested
in seeing those because I'm really
enjoying doing this style of video so I
know a lot of you guys are too because
it's such a quick way to get an idea of
a bunch of drugstore products out there
and which ones are actually worth trying
and which ones maybe you should pass
pass on
pass up on pass on anyway so I hope that
you will subscribe as well and let's go
ahead and get into it I want to start
with something brand-new it's not really
a concealer but I felt like mentioning
well actually technically it is but it's
the Maybelline master camo and apricot I
use this to cancel out my under eye like
dark circles and like my dark circles
there and it is amazing it really does
come out apricot I mean like that is the
whole game so you have to put a
concealer over it after you blend this
in but it does such a great job I did
that today I just really was so
impressed so and it's one of those newer
out there and they have other shades so
I wanted to mention that first because I
didn't want to forget it's amazing the
next one which actually is what I'm
wearing today as well on top of that
master camel is from Milani this is
their retouch and erase light lifting
concealer this one is amazing amazing I
wish Milani was more readily available
for everyone and I know I I don't like
talking about them too much but it's
hard not to because they're so good but
it has this kind of soft sponge kind of
yeah I know it really is a true sponge
on top of it but I always I just kind of
use my fingers you know it is what it is
it's your own concealer so do what you
want with it
it's a beautiful concealer this is one
of those concealers that it brightens
but it also corrects so it kind of does
exactly what I wanted to do now I'm
gonna tell you right now all of these
concealers in fact every concealer I've
ever tried settles into fine lines
period so if you're if you're hoping for
a miracle worker I don't have it for you
I don't know that that exists I think
the difference would be like whether you
set your concealer or not or some people
will put like eye primer like eyeshadow
primer underneath as well I've done that
it usually will make it a little bit
better but then it will kind of look
weird way later in the day so you kind
of got to pick your poison like which
one is worse to you do you want it to
look weird and crepey throughout the day
but it doesn't settle into fine lines or
do you want it to just go ahead and
settle because what I do is just all
everyone smile just kind of do that and
it's fine so anyway so all of these
settle into fine lines I figure I'd get
that out in the open now but these are
just beautiful what I try to do is
just try to avoid that area and really
focus it like here and here for me of
course in my blending it almost always
still creeps up there a little bit but I
don't mind it so this is easily one of
my top five concealers at the drugstore
it's gorgeous
it corrects and it brightens and I wear
it in the shade fair which really I mean
today I'm self tan so I'm Tanner than I
youth Tanner than I usually am but I
could probably get the next shade up as
well but I really really like this and
it's just one of those it's really
creamy you know what I mean when I think
of creamy concealers that's one of the
first ones I think of next is the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin three-in-one
concealer for eyes this was a recent
purchase for me because I was like why
doesn't anyone ever talked about
Neutrogena like I never hear people and
I'm like it can't be that bad of a brand
if they're in like every drugstore and
they've been around for a long time so
anyway I was I'm just been more and more
curious about their products because
I've tried some of their conditions and
I've liked them and things like that so
I decided to give this one a try and I
think it's good I don't think it's like
something that you need to run out and
buy but if you have like a coupon for
Neutrogena or maybe it's like buy one
get one half off I could see
recommending what am I trying to say I
could I would recommend still trying it
but if you're just looking for like the
best concealer at a drugstore I don't
think this is it but what I do think is
cool is that it does have SPF of 20
which is really nice now this is a lot
less brightening just because of the
shade I got this is the shade Ferro 5
interesting so it is a little bit a lot
deeper than the other one I just watched
but I do like it and if you know you
want SPF in that region that you're
going to love this cuz it's still a good
formula it's just not my favorite I
don't think it covers as much as
something like the Milani one does so if
I were battling these the Milani woman
easily win my next one is from L'Oreal
and I've got to be honest I don't know
that they sell this anymore if I can
find it online I will link it but it
might be discontinued so I'm just gonna
talk about it briefly it's really nice
it's got a ton of concealer like for
example this one has 0.27 this one has
point six that's a
concealer but it's their visible lift
blur and I think I liked this because it
was more of a neutral tone than a lot of
concealers I've tried and it was really
easy to blend I really like this
concealer so I don't think it's bad yet
so I'm definitely gonna keep it and keep
using it but I really really like this
concealer I hope you guys can find it
next one this is a like dark circle
corrector
it's the pixie correction concentrate
and brightening peach I really like this
stuff I compare it all the time to my
much more expensive Bobbi Brown I have
it in brightening peach today I just say
that I think I did but I I compared it
to the Bobbi Brown one all the time
I do think the Bobbi Brown formula is
maybe a smidge better but not enough
that it's worth you guys running out and
spending you know a lot more than this
now again pixie is a little bit more
expensive so you know it's now that I'm
thinking about it probably is not that
much more to get the Bobbi Brown one
when you compare I don't know I'll put
the price of this on the screen or down
below anyway but I really really like
this stuff I've traveled with it before
it's just got that classic apricot color
but with this you don't necessarily have
to cover it with another concealer and
so when I compare it to like the master
camo i think this covers a lot but you
have to cover and concealer where it's
with this one it kind of serves as the
concealer you could put another one but
I usually just wear this and call it a
day but I really I really like this
stuff too next one is an oldie but a
goodie I've had this one for so long
well I mean let me rephrase irie
purchased this so it's always in my
collection in some capacity it's the
Maybelline Dream Lumi concealer it gets
really dirty really easily the writing
always gets worn off which always is
like but it's just one of those really
beautiful brightening pens what I like
about this though is I feel like this
one actually has coverage whereas like
the YSL one that's really expensive let
me show you why so one is like four or
five times the price of this and it just
doesn't quite have as much coverage it's
a little bit more see-through this is
the YSL one and I don't think the way I
saw one is
to have coverage so it's not like it's a
knock on this product but you know a lot
of people say these are dukes and I
think I've probably even said you know
years ago that maybe they were similar
in dupes and while I do think they're
very similar in their packaging I think
that the maybelline one is better
because I like that it has both coverage
and brightening and it's a really thin
formula and so it's really quick to
blend in and this is one of those
concealers that I can throw on and blend
with my finger and in like three seconds
it looks perfect
like I don't have to futz with it and
you know it doesn't get cakey in areas
no it just looks beautiful it looks like
skin but just perfect it I love this
stuff gosh I forgot how good this stuff
was if you are looking for like the
ultimate high coverage this is the NYX
gotcha Covered concealer this frickin
stuff is absolutely waterproof
absolutely full full coverage like the
max concealer so like if I needed to
look like there was literally like my
skin was like porous like a porcelain
doll this is the concealer I would grab
honestly I just don't ever wear it
because I never need that much coverage
but if you do this will be your best
friend it's pretty inexpensive because
it is NYX so it's I mean all of these
are drugstore but it's just amazing I
did test it to see if it's waterproof in
the shower and I did a video like a year
ago it is I mean it does not budge so
it's amazing it's really thick like
really thick and really tacky so while
it covers a ton I would say you
definitely need to set it for sure and
it really is awesome though but like I
said I just don't ever use it I don't
even wear it for events because I would
rather I don't know what do I usually
wear for like events really for events I
usually wear something like a
brightening you know like a peach color
and then a concealer over it and I'm
trying
think I know that I've worn this number
71 to an event before anyway so when I
say event I mean like you know not just
me like going to a YouTube event I don't
go to that many but like thinking of
like you know if you're at a special
event like a wedding or anything like
that where you know there's gonna be
photos and flash photography you really
want to look your best your most
presentable anyway but you totally could
wear this I don't see why there would be
any flashback at all there's no SPF in
it so this might be the most ideal and
this is absolutely a dupe for the tart
Oh what is it called I'll put it on the
screen I used to own it it is exactly
the same formula so you can save a ton
of money next up is another one that's
been in the drugstore for a very long
time this is the Maybelline instant age
rewind treatment eraser dark circles
treatment concealer with goji berry and
Halak sille I don't know if I said that
right so I have it in the shade
neutralizer I've owned many different
shades of this I've owned the ones that
are like actual concealer shades I've
owned the one that's brightening and
it's more of like a pink like a light
light pink and then this one is a much
more yellow tone and it's meant to let
me actually get it up into this punch so
it has this creepy gross sponge they say
is um how do they say it like it's a
antibacterial antimicrobial sponge it
might be I don't know I mean I still use
it but this one is getting older so I do
you know that's one that I don't really
mess around with like I just throw it
away if I think it's gone off but it has
really high coverage and I think you
look at this and think oh it'll be kind
of nice and like light no it has crazy
coverage for this neutralizer
and what I remember the brightening one
is that it was almost too brightening
but it was amazing so if you want like
that white pink brightening that stuff
is crazy but but the neutralizer really
does a great job again even on dark
circles what I would like to buy next of
this what I would like to buy next with
this brand would be the like just a
regular concealer shade again because I
think I like that I prefer that over the
neutralizer but it really I mean this
stuff is incredible and it lasts a
surprising amount of time and I like
that you can actually see how much is
left and that you're using
and if the sponge grosses you out a lot
of people just take this bunch off and
it'll still come up through like the
little little cylinder that's coming up
there obviously I have a lot that I
really really like so it's hard but I
will tell you about one that I don't
like this is actually a new one that I
haven't opened because I've already
gotten rid of this once and I got sent
to another one this is the l'oreal
infallible total cover promo color
correcting palette so they have this one
that's kind of peachy to disguise dark
circles the yellow for a discoloration
the green is for redness and the purple
is to brighten
I just don't think these are very good I
feel like again you'd be better off if
you really needed a certain color you
know get the one color you need in
something like this that's a little
easier to work with it's a little bit
creamier you know these will swatch just
fine I'm sorry I don't want to open it
because I figure if someone really
wanted this like a sister I'd rather get
it to them new but i've swatched these
already I've used these and the green
just doesn't stay like I've tried it on
my nose and it just looked crazy
it just looked green and then when I put
foundation over it it just kind of moved
around I'm like so I don't know I just
don't think it's worth the price I'm
sure this is probably around ten dollars
maybe a little bit more and I just don't
think it's good next up is kind of a
would you call this a cult classic I
feel like I've known about this
concealer for so long like back when I
first started my youtube channel and
it's the NYX HD studio concealer I
remember owning this and like saving up
to go to Ulta to buy like the NYX HD
concealer and then I bought the niche
NYX HD like powder or something like
that and I think I bought like one other
thing like I think they had an HD
foundation so I have I bought it all
thinking oh wow HD it's gonna be amazing
I remember being kind of underwhelmed
but I still used it all up because I was
you know I was just excited I was
excited anytime I can afford to buy some
new makeup anyway this one it's it's
good I just don't think it's like the
best concealer out there it's a lot more
of a thinner formula you can kind of see
through it so it's a little bit harder
to build up so I don't think you know
you think HD would be like oh it'll be
like insane cover
no but I think now when I think of HD I
think okay it needs to look good even if
something is like in perfect focus so
maybe it wouldn't be that it's crazy my
coverage maybe it's more that it doesn't
look cakey and stuff but I just feel
like it you know it's just a very
middle-of-the-road concealer I don't
think it does anything special it's not
super high coverage I don't think it's
bad though so you know if you found like
the perfect shade and you wanted to try
it I don't think it's a bad concealer it
stays in place pretty well but I just
don't think it's like my favorite I hope
that makes sense I don't love I'm kind
of realizing I like a creamy concealer I
don't like it really thick but I also
don't like it really thin I like it
right in the middle and so this one's
kind of on the thinner side and I just
wasn't very impressed with it this is
the second time I've tried it the second
one I bought I don't know why I keep
buying it thinking it's gonna suddenly
be magically different yeah 1 2 3 4 5 6
or let's keep going all right the next
one is from wet &amp;amp; wild and a lot of
people were talking about this for the
longest time it's the photo focus
concealer this is actually really good
for the price again it's got that kind
of same consistency as the NYX HD when I
just talked about but I think this one
has a little bit better of coverage so
it's still kind of thinner it's not a
thick formula by any means it reminds me
of like the NARS radiant creamy
concealer but the NARS one is creamier
it's a little bit easier to plan but I
still remember being very impressed the
very first time I tried it and so I
still reach for this from time to time
just because I really like it I think I
need this is light ivory and I think I
had was there one lighter than this and
that one was like too light but I I
think the formula is great especially
considering this is a cheaper drugstore
option thing about drugstore is and I
know I talked about it a lot and I know
you guys have noticed but like drugstore
nowadays L'Oreal me lean I mean these
things are creeping up on 10 12 15
dollars I'm like drop sort of me should
be like the prices of wet and wild you
know what I mean like five dollars six
dollars or less
so anyway regardless though I think this
is great especially if you're in a pinch
for money isn't my favorite concealer
drops
no and I at the end of this video I'll
tell you what my top three are out of
all of these you'll probably be able to
guess but I'll tell you my top three
just so you can kind of you know now
you've watched it all you can kind of
see like okay so to sum it all up here
my favorites anyway so it's okay I do
like this one better than the NYX HD I
will say that next is one that I've
gotten a lot of questions about it's the
covergirl outlast all-day concealer I
have it in fair I just remember feeling
like every time I've used this that it
it's pretty good it's about the right
consistency that I like it's super
creamy not too thin but not too thick
but I just remember I felt like it moved
around a lot like it didn't stay in
place the way I needed it to so I felt
like I needed like a primer underneath
it which is never a step I really want
to do with concealer because the less
under my eye the better so for me like I
didn't hate it but I don't think I would
ever repurchase this like if I ran out I
wouldn't run out and buy it again will I
continue to use it yeah because I don't
think it's bad but again it's not one
that I think you need to run out and get
unless you have like amazing under-eye
where you can put something on like this
and it wouldn't budge but for me it
really just kind of moved around like if
I feel like if I like touch my I'd be
gone and I didn't like that next up is
one of my Holy Grails it's the number
seven radiant glow concealer this is
very this one's so much more similar to
the way I saw one that I showed you
earlier it's the same applicator just
like the Maybelline Dream Lumi one same
kind of applicator this is sold at
Target I always hesitate to call number
seven or pixie or any of those Target
brands drugstore because they're usually
more expensive but they're not like
high-end high-end prices so this one's
kind of drugstore but I wanted to
mention anyway because it's so good I
think I'm almost out of this one this is
the one that I use this up I've had to
replace like this is one of the few
concealers I've used up again it's a
very thin consistency which I don't
typically like but it's just like that
Maybelline one where I feel like it has
enough coverage and when I just go it's
blended in perfectly I don't need a
sponge I don't need a brush it is the
quickest concealer and that's why it's
my go-to it just looks beautiful it's
not a high high cover it's like I said
but it just makes my that area on my
inner corner and my under-eye just
pretty and that's why I continue to go
back to it over and over again it's
almost something you can't explain until
you try it this next one I bought
overseas I think like in the Dublin
Airport or somewhere but it's from
Bourjois and it's the radiance reveal
concealer so I know in America the odds
of us being able to get this is slim
I'll see if I can find it but I know
it's sold in a lot of other countries
well it's amazing it's so brightening
and yet it conceals well enough it is
just a really good concealer and I feel
like I consistently tried so many
products from brands that I can't get in
America I'll always haul a bunch of
makeup and then I end up getting rid of
it over time just cuz I'm not as
impressed with it as I'd hope to be but
this one was one that I was so impressed
with I just love it again it reminds me
of this number 7 one but maybe it has a
little bit more coverage I'd heard some
people say when I showed it on my
snapchat back when we were traveling and
I showed this some of you guys said oh
you know be careful when you fly with it
because people have said that when they
they would use it they're overseas but
once they flew with it like the
consistency was different the formula
changed so it didn't seem to change for
me which is good I just really I love it
so much it's again one of those that
blends in so seamlessly that it looks
like you're not wearing concealer it
looks like you just naturally have a
really nice under eyes and I love that
last two are ones that I have not tried
as much but I figured I'd at least show
you them so you can at least know that
they exist and that they're out there
but I really can't give you my full
thoughts on them yet but this is the
pixie Pat away concealing base
absolutely looks a lot like the Tarte
shaped tape a little bit of a different
shaped doe foot applicator but I think
that was the idea it's got the same kind
of a formula I think the shape tapes a
little bit thicker let's compare they're
probably going to be a different shade
but just looking at the DOE foot very
similar sizes let's just see oh no so
the I do think the turn shape tip has
way higher coverage so the tick c1 is a
lot thinner then the tarp shape tape
like a lot thinner but in that way like
the tart shape tip I know so many people
like for me every time I use it and I've
used it a million times a million
different ways I just feel like it's so
much more work than I want it to be
whereas the pixie one does feel like
it's a little bit less work that might
be because it is thinner but I think it
also doesn't have quite as high of
coverage as the tart shape tape because
of that so I think it's a good concealer
I just need to try it out some more see
last one is this Revlon youth FX fill
and blur concealer and I'm gonna be
honest I haven't even tried this at all
so let's let's try it it's a pen type I
got it in fair so we'll at least watch
the the applicator is really really a
soft sponge so it comes through a bunch
of tiny holes ooh
it's really creamy and it looks like it
would have pretty good coverage I this
feels like the NARS creamy concealer to
me like the same consistency it even
looks like a shade like the shade
vanilla that's pretty cool so I said I
got it in fair I think the idea is it's
supposed to look like it's kind of
anti-aging you fill those areas so I'll
have to try it out let you guys know but
formula wise I it feels like one that I
really would like so that's exciting I
can tell you what will drive me nuts
already though is that this is going to
be super dirty
okay I know I said I would do a top
three concealers but I'm gonna do top
four I'm sorry I'm just gonna do it so
out of all of that I just picked out my
top four my top one for coverage is this
NYX got you covered I just like I said
earlier it is unbelievable for coverage
unmatched in the drugstore totally
awesome my favorite just everyday
probably overall concealer is the Milani
retouching erase I just think it's
amazing it's what I'm wearing today for
a reason
it just looks flawless it's creamy
it has great coverage it brightens it's
got it all I love it
and then my favorite kind of brightening
quick concealers it's just a tie between
the number seven one and the Maybelline
Dream Lumi they're both so similar and
they're just both so beautiful the
Maybelline one's a little bit cheaper so
I would probably just go for that one
but I love them both I've repurchase
both in the past so they're kind of tied
for that same kind of brightening
everyday quick but pretty concealer look
so those are all of my drugstore
concealers it was a lot I always do two
clutters and I'm gonna start
decluttering my collection again soon
I'll probably do concealer soon and so
some of these will be declared whether
it's because I just wasn't impressed
with them or they're just old and it's
time you know there's a lot of these
that I really feel like that's obviously
