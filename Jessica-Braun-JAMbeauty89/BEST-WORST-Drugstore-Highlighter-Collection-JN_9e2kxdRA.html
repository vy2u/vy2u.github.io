my highlight collection video nubbies
I'm only pulling out my drugstore ones
for right now and I'm just going to go
through every single drugstore highlight
that I own both powder and cream and
liquid and tell you what I recommend and
what I think you should stay away from
so it really is my best and worst of
drugstore highlighters if you enjoy
these kinds of videos definitely give it
a thumbs up I've done one previously a
drugstore foundation collection vestan
works I will link that below if you're
interested to see all of those I think I
had 16 different drugstore foundations I
hope that you will subscribe to stick
around for more drugstore and high-end
makeup videos and reviews and let's go
and get into it so let's start with some
elf product I have a couple of elf
highlighters and people talk really
highly about these and I don't love them
as much as other people do these are the
elf baked highlighters these retail for
4 dollars they have 4 different shades
and I have the shade blush gems and it's
a more kind of bronzy highlight and then
I also have the shade moonlight pearls
which is a lot more of an ivory
champagne highlight now the reason I had
beef with these bad boys was because
when I first got him I didn't know you
had to scrape off the top layer of this
baked product and so a lot of you guys
told me that and I'm like you know
that's kind of ridiculous that you buy
products and you have to work to get
them to work the way they should have
worked in the first place
so I think because of that it bothers me
I bought tons of baked products even
ones that are you know within the same
price range I think like hard candy
baked products and I've never had to
scrape off a layer to get it to work and
I think that's what bothered me about
these you guys know I love elf there's
so many L products that I adore but it
really kind of like really they don't
like have a machine that will do that
for them so it's ready to go because not
everyone watches YouTube videos and
looks things up online to know that you
have to scrape it off so a lot of people
would try it be like what this doesn't
work and then they would just give it
away or throw it away or return it so
however once you do scrape off the top
layer these are absolutely gorgeous I
think I'm like blush gems
than moonlight pearl it's a little bit
more of a deeper color but I think it's
just a little bit more pigmented at
least the one I have these are nice
these are not like kaboom in-your-face
highlighters they're kind of in the
middle so I might bet for that reason I
think they are pretty now do i reach for
these very often not really I have so
many other powders that are even more
buttery and even more of what I want
whether I want like a really light
highlighter look or I want a really
ba-ba-boom highlighter look that was too
right the middle so I just don't reach
for them very often the next one is also
from else so after they release those a
couple years later they released their
shimmer highlighting powders these
retail for six dollars they have three
shades but as I'm filming this it looks
like the deepest shade is sold out
currently but I had the other two shades
the the one that's sold out right now is
darkest one is called bronze glow so I
have the lightest one which is called
starlight glow and these they claim to
be really lightweight which I really
agree I mean they're they don't kick up
a lot of powder they definitely have a
nice shimmer to them without having any
glitter which is why they're called a
shimmer highlight but the next shade up
is sunset glow which is a little bit
deeper more of a golden tones they're
not super different but there definitely
is a difference in them and you can see
in the swatches I will say this I like
these better than the baked one the
packaging on this is a little bit more
substantial there's a mirror and you
don't have to work at them and I really
appreciate that and again like I said
they don't kick up a lot of powder
they're really thin layer so they end up
staying in place pretty well throughout
the day and I just like them so the next
elf product is their illuminating
palette I've gotten a lot of questions
about this it has four different
highlights in it it retails for six
dollars and
this is not a completely shimmer palette
these are really more of like a satin
finish
I wouldn't call any of these shimmery
the most the closest to shimmer you'll
get is this trait here and even that one
not it really is more of a satin finish
so in my opinion the idea behind this is
more to be used as to brighten but not
necessarily to add shimmer to them these
do kick up a
amount of powder and not enough that is
to turn off but it definitely does they
are a little bit powders but they also
still have a lot of pigment to them so
it's kind of both of those in one is
okay now if they were powdery and they
didn't show up then that'd be different
but I think this is pretty cool
for six bucks you get four different
shades I like to use the lighter shade
here to set my under eye from time to
time because it's not glittery or
shimmery I'll use it down the bridge of
my nose to highlight that part I like
the middle the kind of medium shade I'll
use this is a highlighter if I want to
look a lot more natural where just
brightens the area but doesn't add any
shimmer or glitter so I think it's a
cool product if you're looking for
shimmer however you won't like that so
it just depends on what you're looking
for the last elf product I have is their
what do they call it liquid highlighter
it is four dollars there's one shade and
the idea of this is to say liquid but
it's oil-based so definitely you can
tell it's oil-based
however because of that it has this
really cool glow now if you have oily
skin oil plus oil equals way too much
oil but if you've got normal or dry skin
and I think maybe combination I think
this could work as long as you're really
strategic about where you place it I
really like this stuff it's like a
different look than any other product
i've ever tried but especially like in
the winter when your skin's already dry
if you're like me i think it has a
really nice glow that like I said it's
just a very different look than anything
else because of that oil because of the
fact that it's oil based so the next
product that is absolutely horrible and
I mean horrible is this hard candy
glamoflauge mix and drops in radiance I
have gotten so many tweets snaps
Instagram messages from you guys telling
me that you have the same problem I have
so it tells me it's not just that I got
a bad batch or it's been sitting there a
long time or maybe all of ours have been
sitting in Walmart for too long but no
matter how long you shake this thing up
I'm talking like I swear I found your
and shook it up for like a couple of
minutes
it's a dropper and I have there like
drops that are like foundation drops and
there's they're fine they're the
weirdest grow
this consistency you will ever see it is
disgusting so you can't even get like a
good sense of how they work because
they're this horrible oily but like with
a little bit of pigment it's just really
bad really bad so I don't know what is
going on with these I don't know how
these are still on the Shelf I freaking
love hard candy maybe they don't know
what's going on or maybe when they're
coming out of the factory or whatever
they're they don't look like this and
maybe it is from sitting there I don't
know but it's really bad so stay far far
away for now I'm sure they will
eventually fix this because like I said
I love hard candy I love so many of
their products but this one I was like I
don't think they meant recipe like that
this next product is from NYX this one
is very new to me but I adore it it's
the NYX doses do face gloss and it's
just a stick and it's got a kind of
angled and I kind of I mean it's
completely egg cold and it's just one of
those sticks where you can just kind of
stick it on if you want to put a string
on put on your hand and kind of dab it
onto your face it's not Glary it just
has this glow but I think the term face
cloth is the perfect term for it because
that's what it looks like but it doesn't
it's glossy in the way that it looks but
it doesn't feel like you just put a
lipgloss on your face you know what I'm
saying so it just gives that effect
without actually being a gloss oh my
dear my next one is from essence it's
their pure new highlighter these are
what is it on all those website is 449
if a domed product it is the most
beautiful highlight for every day
beautiful because it doesn't have
glitter it just has this gorgeous beige
like shimmer it you can never look too
heavy-handed with it and yet you look so
beautiful and glowy I don't even know
how to swatch it to do it justice
honestly because it's one of those
things that you just have to see on the
face it's so pretty you guys it's so
finely milled it reminds me of hourglass
powders because you get your brush in it
and it just spreads evenly and perfectly
over your face it doesn't look too
concentrated in any one area it's so
easy to use and yet you look like a
supermodel it's that kind of super
glow that you're like even wearing
highlighter oh my gosh if that's what
this does is so beautiful and it's under
five dollars
I can't believe there is this good of a
highlight for under five dollars yes I
can because we find all kinds of amazing
products but even still amazing if you
haven't picked it up go pick it up the
next one I'm going to mention is from
L'Oreal it's the True Match Lumi liquid
glow illuminator it's a prime and
highlight I only use a highlighting I
don't prime with it I have it in the
shade ice they have three different
shades and this retails for $12.99 of
course you can get it for cheaper
depending on where you go I'm just
wasn't it all says website but the other
cheats they have they have a more rosy
tone one called rose and they have a
more golden one called golden this is a
great product has a similar effect to
the Becca highlighting liquid or any of
those kind of products you don't have to
spend that kind of money these do the
same thing they last just as long you
just want to find a shade that
accentuates your skin tone the bed for
me I think this one's nice I be
interested to try rose and golden I
don't know that golden will work but I
would be interested to try rose for sure
but these pack a huge punch I mean you
can see from a distance how much of a
punch they pack again you can put it on
a lot lighter if you put it on your hand
and dab it on with the sponge clearly
I'm a big proponent for that because
that's my favorite way to apply these so
that they still look natural they don't
look like a stripe on your skin because
for me I didn't use cream highlighted
for a long time because I was
intimidated by them I wasn't sure you
know how do you put them on without
messing up everything else and that is
the best way I have found to put them on
so I totally recommend it but I would
say wait for a sale or use the coupon
buy it somewhere where it's cheaper
because I think they're great but I
think $13 is a little bit steep so the
next product is one of my all-time
favorites drugstore high end decide
doesn't matter I love this it's the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips
natural nude palette
it says palette for face and eyes
because you can totally use each of
these like is it twelve shades for
eyeshadows they're really small it comes
with a brush in the back and a little
like I brush if you really wanted it I
just use it as a highlight honestly I've
got plenty of eyebrows this is so
beautiful if you keep to the lighter
shade
get a lighter highlight if you keep to
the darker shades you can get a deeper
highlight and if you mix it all together
you get a really pretty kind of bronzy
gold you can almost wear this as a blush
I mean there's so much you can do with
it but the best part is it looks so
beautiful on the skin it's one of those
thin formulas but really buttery it
stays where you put it and it just looks
beautiful I mean so beautiful
now this they have two shades I have
natural and then they also have warm and
it's $13.99 again Physicians Formula
they have failed all the time so the
next one is from wet and wild I think
they sent me to me a while ago but I'm
at Walgreens CVS Walmart etc these are
their highlighting powders I from what I
can see they only have two shades
I thought they had three but maybe they
do only have two because that's all I
can find
I have precious petals which is a little
bit lighter than the other one which is
called proud of my canopy they have this
really pretty design these are 499
desire to stand up but it's really
pretty designed that kind of a leaf
flower like design on them and they're
surprisingly nice quality sometimes like
I've had some of the wet and wild
limited and those can be really chalky
and just not as pretty on the skin but
these are really really pretty on the
skin so I think that precious petals for
me works the best these are both kind of
deep for my skin tone so I don't graph
to them a lot but if you do have a
deeper skin tone these are going to look
even more beautiful so that's something
to keep in mind I wish they had a little
bit lighter of one but it still works
it's just I can almost use it more as a
blush shopper than I can just as a
standalone highlight but very impressive
highlighters okay so the next product is
from hard candy and this is their sheer
envy prismatic highlighter iridescent
pearl powder this stuff is what is it
six dollars at Walmart it is the most
powering thing I've ever seen in my
entire blessing it's just so powdery and
it's a shame because the the coloring of
it looks pretty but it's so powdery in a
second you kind of wipe the powder away
the highlight is gone and so for that
reason I was very disappointed
considering you can get
amazing highlighters like this next I'm
going to show you makeup revolution one
it's amazing it is five bucks like the
wet and wild ones the essence one those
are all cheaper than this one and the
quality is like night and day
the next one I talked about is from
makeup revolution they sell it the Ulta
and it's their vivid baked highlighter
they have five shades and these retail
for six dollars I have the shade radiant
lights and it's again such a pretty
natural looking highlight it's not super
shimmery there's no glitter but if you
want more of a natural highlight that
has a little bit of glow because you
don't want to like have a stripe this is
perfect if you're a beginner or not
doesn't matter it's so beautiful I
really like radiant lights it looks like
they have one that's more with a blush
shade called rose gold light kind of
want to try that but I really liked it
to have a really cool kind of design in
the actual power the only my only stupid
petty gripe is that the writing wiped
away so quickly and I always makes me so
sad I know that's so dumb but I wish I
could still read it and I've only used
this like probably a little over ten
times just because I have so many
highlights I love it but it's already
wiped away is that really shallow that's
really shallow I know and apparently I'm
just not being it says in the details
that it's only at Ulta go figure the
last product I'm going to talk about
it's hard to buy online
it's from Milani and on Milani website
they have seven shades which surprised
me I didn't realize there was that many
shade and it's ten dollars but the only
other place you can buy it online it's
Beauty Bay and they only have four the
shades and they're $15 there's so if you
can find it source ideal I found these
out not a woman yeah at Walmart
sometimes I I know Milani it sold at
other random swords buy sometimes you
can find at Walgreens CVS but it's so
hit or miss so just keep your eyes
peeled because they're not as easy to
buy online I have two shades of their
strobe white highlighting powders I have
a shade a glow which is more of a golden
tone and then I also have the shade
afterglow which is a little bit more
ivory like but these are some of my
favorite drugstore highlighters the
packaging is beautiful the after effect
is beautiful it's not powdery at all
just an all-around gorgeous gorgeous
highlighter I think my favorite for my
skin tell
the lighter one but I've been wearing
the day clothes a little bit deeper once
a lot lately and I really like that even
for my skin tone against the giant take
away with this whole video is that I
feel like with highlighters you can find
exactly what you need the drugstore you
don't have to spend 30 40 50 60 dollars
on a highlight because honestly most of
my collection are amazing highlighters I
don't feel the need to reach into my
more expensive ones now I do because
well I mean I spent the money on them
why would I not use them but I'm finding
myself reaching for drugstore
highlighters honestly probably more
often than my iron ones because they do
the same thing and I just really like
them so it's something to keep in mind
if you're new to highlighters or if
maybe you're just like gosh like I'm
tired to spend so much money you don't
need to spend a lot of money on
highlighters these are all amazing I'm
not a new lip product I feel like it's
looking weird it's the NYX like lip sync
and it's wearing off really oddly so
hopefully this video is helpful if it
was helpful for you and you like this
style give it a thumbs up so that I know
definitely check out my other drugstore
collection review video of my drugstore
foundations I will link it below and I
hope that you'll stick around and watch
