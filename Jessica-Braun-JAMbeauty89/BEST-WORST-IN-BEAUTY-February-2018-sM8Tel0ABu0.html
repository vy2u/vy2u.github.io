February best and worst I've got some
skincare some makeup lip products I've
got things I loved and I have things I
absolutely hated I'm so excited to share
these with you if you enjoyed this kind
of video I hope that you will subscribe
and let's go ahead an get into it so I'm
really excited to announce that I'm
working with l'occitane and this is a
brand that I've used like their hand
creams since before I even had a YouTube
channel so that would have been like
five or six years ago I remember loving
their hand creams actually I could use
some right now often my hands and so
then I started getting into some more of
their skincare well
I've fallen in love with the skincare
line I always try to be clear with you
guys when I'm being sponsored in this
video is sponsored by locs the time this
line I've been trying for maybe a month
and a half at this point maybe even
bordering on two months I've really
really liked it and I tried to keep hush
about it because I really wanted to see
how it worked with my skin and see if I
liked it well let me kind of tell you
the order that I've been using these
products so it's this immortelle divine
line and so all of the products are in
this really cute like goalless yellow
packaging this is their divine cleansing
balm and it comes in a jar it looks like
a little honeypot and cleansing balms
are my favorite way to remove makeup I
very rarely use my seller water or like
cleansing wipes on my face I just don't
and that's just kind of the way I've
been doing it for a few years and my
skin really does well so I get a little
bit of out of there and I just massage
it I usually will start with my eyes cuz
that's where the most of my makeup is
and then I'll just kind of work it out
and then I'll rinse it with water and it
gets rid of all my makeup it gets rid of
waterproof mascara and liner which is
always my problem area I'm sure it's the
most people's and then I double cleanse
with their cleansers so this one kind of
foams up I really like that I like
cleansers and squeezy tubes a lot
because I know that I can get all of it
out of there but those work really
really well together if you'd like to
double cleanse like I do and I feel like
by the end of it my skin the makeup is
gone but it's not completely dried out
and that is huge for me because I have
normal to dry skin so then I'll go and
make their little eye cream I love look
at this cute packaging I'll get pump or
two and my like on my middle finger I'll
Pat them together and then I do
Pat it around in a circle and I feel
like this has helped my little what I
call my under-eye crinkles it helps them
appear less obvious in my opinion I've
been using this line at night but I'll
pull in the eye cream and the face cream
I'm going to talk about even in the
morning to use just because my skin does
really soak it up and I feel like it
really enjoys it on most nights
especially as we're going from winter
into spring right now I'll use their oil
this is their facial oil and it's got
one of those little droppers where you
push the top and it sucks up some of the
oil and then what I will do is I'll kind
of warm it between my fingers so I'll
put a little bit on my fingers I don't
want to waste too much I love this stuff
and just do that and then I'll just
press it into my skin and I feel like
again my skin just soaks it up it looks
so much more radiant and youthful
afterwards and these do have a smell but
it's a very pleasant smell and then I'll
follow it up with their moisturizing
cream again it's in like a cute little
pot it's a very nice cream cuz it's not
so thick that it's hard to get your skin
to soak it up but it's not so thin that
you feel like you're not really putting
anything on it's kind of right in
between like a hybrid and my skin I
always say it drinks it up but it really
is drinking it up and I feel like when
I'll go to bed my skin I'll just kind of
catch myself in the mirror I'm like my
skin actually looks pretty nice like
usually I feel like I'll look in the
mirror be like oh thank you no nary so
I've really been enjoying this line if
you're interested in any of these
products I will link all five of them
below in the order that I apply them to
my face when I am getting unready
or in some cases getting ready like I'll
use the eye cream in the cream to get
ready as well because I think they do
well under makeup they don't make your
makeup look weird or anything like that
so that's kind of my skincare favorite
for the month let's move into some
products I didn't like what kind of
bounced around so one product I
absolutely have realized I hated is the
nude Beauty Blender and I'm really
really sad because I love the fact that
this was beige because then like my
foundation it wouldn't look as dirty as
it probably really is it's a completely
different texture than the normal Beauty
Blender it's a lot less dense and
because of that one it gets wet and gets
bigger it like soaks up the product and
does not blend it into the skin it is
one of the worst sponges
try it and I kept using it thinking oh
maybe it's just this foundation or now
maybe it's this foundation maybe it's
the primer and I finally realized this
is the common denominator it's this
freaking blender and so when I kind of
put my feelers out to you guys a lot of
you guys said no seriously they're
completely different sponges I'm like
okay I'm not crazy so I like the regular
beauty blender I still love my L'Oreal
sponge the best out of all of them so
you know take it with a grain of salt
but I just the nude one stay far away
even the black one I've tried was better
than this but I still don't think that
one was nearly as good as the original
pink the original pink one was is the
best one of the Beauty Blender
line oh my gosh can I talk about the
worst foundation I've ever tried and I
felt so validated when I saw other
youtubers trying it on in videos and
they hated it too this is the Marc
Jacobs shameless foundation um oh my
goodness so they sent a couple shades of
these to me I've got fair why 110 and
why 130 I might've even mixed these when
I put them on I don't remember this was
a horrendous experience horrendous it's
okay so it's a squeezy tube and this is
not a cheap foundation I mean this is so
expensive but you guys know even if
something sent to me I'm always honest
with you guys so you squeeze it on and
it's kind of a you know it's not super
thin but it's not super thick and it's
like oh wow that's gonna have some
serious coverage well it makes your skin
look so terrible
it creates imperfections on your face
that you never knew you had like I would
have areas of my face like mmm trying to
think of exactly where it was it'd be
like here I've never had areas there but
it looked like crazy and crepey and like
there'd be like wrinkles like what like
it made no sense I've never tried a mess
not a mascara a foundation like this
where I've so instantly known this is
terrible so I tried it again the next
day and I was like nope nope nope and I
just wiped it off because I thought well
maybe if I try it with a brush I maybe
if I try it with a Beauty Blender my
fingers all terrible all the same look
at the end it was weird and patchy and
by the end of the day I literally could
not wait to get home to take it off it
looked so bad so so bad I cannot stress
that
so do not waste your money I know with
some higher-end foundations it's hit or
miss like oh you know oh this foundation
half of the youtubers out there really
like in half don't maybe it's more of a
skin type thing no this is terrible
across the board no matter what no ifs
ands or buts i I've never felt this
strongly about a foundation and it makes
me really sad cuz I want to like
something like this I go how exciting
it's a really expensive foundation and
I've got it mmm it's so bad can't try it
again
hey I keep seeing them in my Jordan like
maybe I'll try it again cuz I'm like oh
it looks so pretty and I really like
more chips I do like I love a lot of our
jacobs products horrible
they absolutely missed the mark I don't
know how in the world that hit the
shelves did anyone from the brand try it
no I need much much happier note I
discovered this product while I didn't
discover it they sent this to me it's a
brand I've never ever heard of I don't
know how to say it I think it's guys
gi's GUI ze could be guiz jeez I don't
know but it's their face FX contour
powder collection this is in the
moonlight series it's for lighter skin I
think they have a deeper one as well
like there's three all I've seen it on
is their website you guys their whole
thing is I was kind of clicking around
their website just trying to figure out
like who is this brand they their whole
thing was they just wanted to make the
best contour palette out there now
here's the thing
the makeup industry is oversaturated now
with contour palette I like palettes
this is the best one and here's why the
I've already hit pan I swear to you guys
I've had this a month and a half that's
insane
that is insane I've used that free I
want this powder alone I want I want
that powder but all of this is so good
and every time I've used any part of
this power people like Oh what are you
what's on YouTube what's then I always
get asked what I'm wearing so they have
this kind of more cool tone contour
shade these are so pigmented but they
blend so beautifully then they have this
bronzer shade
and then they have this like highlight
shimmer I'm saving the best for last and
the highlight shimmer is so pretty it
blends in it looks I mean the light just
hits you so beautifully I'm gonna put
some on right now because I did a Tryon
video before this so I haven't really
put on a super-dee-duper highlight look
at this isn't that's so pretty I mean
here's the thing shimmery highlights
it's like no one's impressed by them
anymore because everyone does them
pretty well I just love it
here's the best part of this palette
this almond colored powder is the most
pigmented beautiful powder I've ever
used it's hard to see here's what's
amazing about I'm gonna show you this in
action you're not gonna believe it so
let me clean this brush off because
there's like bronzer on it so I'll get a
little bit and it is very powdery which
is probably why I've hit pan if I wanted
to clean this area up like let's say I
did like a contouring oh my god it's
looking a little splotchy I'll just put
that on do you see how light that is
and just kind of blend it up and it
makes everything look so flawless I'll
use this on my under eye and it's so
nice because it's not a loose powder
where it's a little bit trickier to work
with but it III don't even have to put
this into words it's so good now I want
to say it's kind of pricey I want to say
it's like forty fifty dollars when I run
out of this especially once I run out of
that I will probably just buy it with my
own money because I cannot stop using
this I don't reach in my bronzer tour
anymore
I just don't because I use all of this
I've been using this on my under-eye
it's it's so freaking good you won't
regret it I promise if you're near my
skin tone I don't know about the darker
one like if it's as good as this I would
hope that it is if that's all they're
focusing all of their energy into but
holy moly I could shout it from the
rooftops it is so good so I've been
using this Mac mineralized charged water
and I've been using it everyday for like
a month and I'm only down and I spray a
lot so this is gonna last me quite a
while but if you wanted to try it they
usually sell smaller versions of these
kind
of things I don't know specifically with
the charge water if they do but I will
spray this on as my setting spray and I
love it right now because all those
powders and things I'm putting on my
face it just my skin feels even more
hydrated than it already is and it just
helps the powders all blend together and
there's something about this that I just
if my skin it just feels good on my skin
and I haven't felt that way about a
setting spray or hydrating mist in a
long time and you know I don't know that
this necessarily makes my makeup last
longer but I certainly don't think it
make it makes it last not as long does
that make sense like I've not noticed
anywhere time issues but it just it
makes my skin look so much more seamless
dewy I've had so many of you guys say oh
my gosh Jessica you got this pregnancy
glow I'm like maybe but also it really
just might be this and the skincare I've
been using like mix the two together and
I feel like that's where a lot of this
is coming from so Anne on favorites this
was so bad this was such a bad product
this is the Catrice glam &amp;amp; dolls super
black liner and waterproof oh my
goodness where do I even begin with this
so I'm a snob and by a snob I mean I
have another like $5 liner that I like
more and it's that NYX epic ink liner
that I buy an Ulta calm this is a
felt-tip and it canape what now it's
looking super black don't do this to me
okay so when I'm doing it now it's
looking super-dee-duper black well when
I have used it and I used it for like
two weeks and I would shake it up and
I'd store it upside down then right-side
up then sideways just trying to figure
out like is there anything in this it
went it would skip I would try to just
do a wing and it would like just not
show up like there was nothing on the
thing and so of course now that I've
given up on it it's looking a lot
blacker so I don't know that was my main
thing now I'm like well I guess I should
try it again I tried you for like two
weeks girl so I don't know maybe I'll
try it again but if it's that hit or
miss I have a problem with that like you
know let's say it's black now and I used
to say who's black but then tomorrow I
pull it out it's again I can't get it in
there and I can't fill it in after I've
used it for like 10 seconds in one area
it's like I can't get it to reduce
itself I don't know so with that in mind
I need something that's not hit or miss
at all it needs to be able to work right
away and the Knicks won that's right
around the same price range works every
time no matter what so it's like I
shouldn't even have to deal with that if
I can find a better product at the same
price you know okay a favorite that took
me by surprise this is the naked petite
heat it is I got okay weird it's kind of
a long story but Urban Decay they send
me a lot of their products and I'm
always so excited to try their stuff but
they sent me the naked heat palette and
I just didn't really like it it was okay
but every look I did kind of look the
same and I was like I've kind of got
this in a million palettes do I really
need this I passed it on to a friend
because I knew she would use it more
than I would and she'd be more excited
but then when they sent this I saw it
I'm like not again like more of these we
have so many of these but then I started
using it I'm like okay actually this is
perfect for me because I do mostly matte
looks and I'll usually put a little
shimmer on like the lid maybe well these
are all matte there's like a little bit
of a satin finish to this white color
that I love putting on my brow bone or
on my lid and then the rest of them I
get use out of every single color these
are beautiful in the crease these are
beautiful in the outer corner this I can
line with I could darken the outer
corner even more I use every single
color here and so I'm like dang this is
actually a really nice palette so I like
that it's small of course it's the same
size as their like naked basics palette
really nice packaging satisfying class
so I was really taken by surprise with
this so just to show you some swatches
it's very pigmented and true Urban Decay
fashion I mean they very rarely miss
when it comes to their palettes now
sometimes they do but it is pretty rare
I feel like they're pretty much across
the board
awesome so really recommend if this is
up your alley if you know you use more
mattes than anything I I was taken by
surprise that I liked it as much as I do
all right this next products from
L'Oreal and I've had these a while these
are their color riche shines these
remind me they used to have this line
and I always wonder I'm like is this
that same older line just repackaged if
very well could be but it was like there
I can't think of what it's called if you
guys know what I'm talking about
but these are like these kind of sheer
washes of color so
this looks really deep purple but it's
actually a really pretty almost plum
it's called gleaming plum but they're
the packaging is kind of cool it's like
this clear with like this really cool
design and a little bit of gold these
don't have a really terrible lore'l
smell like their lip products I usually
can't do this is called dewy petal and
it's just a really nice light pink wash
of color I have really been enjoying
these really really been enjoying them
because you know as we're heading into
spring I like these more lighter washed
color now that one is not quite as light
this one's enamel red so it really is
not hit or miss but very different
depending on the shade that you get this
one is probably my favorite of the line
this is glossy fawn but I've been using
a lot of these I have even more shades I
just wanted to show you a couple but
they're just healthy-looking on the lips
comfortable now it's not what I'm
wearing on my lips now what I'm wearing
right now is the number 7 - in well Oh
sparkling rose I mean it doesn't really
like mask my lip color just adds like a
lot of glitter it's pretty comfortable
to wear so in case you were curious
that's why I'm wearing those are all of
my favorites for the month and my least
favorites I hope that you enjoyed these
