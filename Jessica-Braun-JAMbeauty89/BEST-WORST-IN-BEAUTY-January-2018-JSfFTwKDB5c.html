my January best and worst in beauty I
have a lot in front of me these I
haven't done a best and worst in beauty
video in a long time like it's been
months I did my jammy Awards which are
like my best and worst for the whole
year but before that and I did that
maybe a month ago I feel like I hadn't I
didn't do one for like December I don't
think I did one for November I don't
even know that I did one for October so
it's been a while and I missed this so
if you enjoyed this kind of a video
definitely subscribe hit that thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this video and
let's go and get into it where to begin
I have some new products to me that I'm
obsessed with as some old ones and I'm
so excited so let's start with a palette
that I feel like no one's talking about
it's the persona identity palette you
can buy it at Ulta is where I got it
and it's made by sona Kasparian who's
another youtuber here this palette is
beautiful if you're like me and you're a
neutrals girl and you know everyone so
I'll do colors but for the most part I
really just look neutrals it has 1 2 3 4
5 6 shimmers and looks like 6 mattes the
color range is so beautiful these are
such beautiful shadows such beautiful
shadows these are the shimmers oh my
gosh the mattes blend really really well
so one of those palettes that when I got
it I'm like I think I'm gonna like that
and then I tried it him like yo look at
how creamy those mats are uh that's
maybe again this is a very creamy
palette that's a really good way to
describe it the math in the shimmers are
just creamy and buttery and yet they
blend really well so you can get a
really soft look on the eye if you want
it now this is not what I'm wearing on
my eyes today although I probably could
have gotten this look with like this
orange here and a little of maybe
goddess over here anyway these are so
gorgeous I could get a complete look out
of them the only thing I wish it had is
maybe a more like a really really light
matte lighter than this even this works
for me but anyway that's about the only
thing I would add I think this palette
is absolutely gorgeous
really thin it says the names on the
back of the shades as well as on the
inside which I also appreciate and I
can't believe more if you
aren't talking about this it's gorgeous
drinkin some oj this morning I'm just
been craving it like crazy so we'll do
all the flops by the way at the end so
another favorite and this one I honestly
did not think I would like I don't know
why I didn't think I would like it but I
just kind of I don't know I thought it
kind of looks dumb but it's not so mean
it's the benefit hoola kwikki contour
stick I don't remember what finally
coaxed me to buy this but I did and
first of all the packaging is pretty I
love the gold snap shut it's just kind
of cute looks like a bamboo Reed almost
but I have it oh there's just one shape
oh oh no oh man got like stains on my
carpet so okay I mean it's not that deep
but it still makes me sad because it is
expensive it's fine but anyway so I need
to be careful is what I'm learning
anyway this the way that I apply this is
I just you know throw a little bit there
a little bit up here and then I'll grab
either a sponge my other favorite way to
do it is with my little Clarisonic thing
that I'm going to talk about in a second
just blend it in and it looks so natural
and I love that it's not a powder so it
doesn't you know I've got some dry skin
like right here and so I'm just noticing
that foundations and bronzers all those
things are kind of emphasizing that
dryness and this does not because it's a
cream so it's kind of like almost
pushing the dryness down I don't know
but I love it the shade is really nice
now if you've got really deep deep skin
this is not gonna be a shade that will
work for you I hate that it's just one
shade but I really really like the
product inside so that one kind of took
me by surprise this month we've had
quite an experience by the way with
furniture delivery recently we bought
our house in this summer is our very
first house for both of us and of course
together because before we lived in an
apartment and so we've been slowly
buying furniture and so we were buying
some like coffee tables and stuff at
this place called weekends only I don't
know if that's like a nationwide thing I
don't know but they're literally only
open on the weekend
and so they've got crazy good deals and
we've looked up some of the furniture
actually after we bought them and we
learned that you know a lot of that
furniture is still sold at like Kittles
and other really nice furniture places
but you know for double the price we're
like days so it's really exciting when
you find something you like there so we
found a whole set of like two coffee
tables a TV kind of stand thing and a
well I guess it's two side tables a nice
coffee table and a TV stand beautiful
the color of wood we wanted really well
made and it was a really good deal and
so we're like perfect well they're like
well you can only get the floor model
and then this one's broken and we're
like oh my gosh so ended up being a
nightmare and then when we finally got
it delivered they forgot one of the
pieces of furniture because they never
charged us for it and we're the
dumb-dumbs that didn't notice so then we
had to go back well poor Tyler had to go
back to this place on the weekend buy it
again couldn't fit it they don't have it
there so it's got to be shipped a week
later so it's just like poor Tyler is
going through the ringer for this
furniture and right now he's putting one
of the things together and I can't wait
to see it why why did I just tell that
story but has anyone else had just like
nightmare furniture stories where it's
like you find what you love in that home
we only have one in stock and it's
broken and otherwise we can get a chip
from California but it'll be ten years
and what what forget it but now I'm like
we're too deep we've already bought most
of the set we want the completes anyway
there was no point to that story alright
so another favourites is something that
I've used for now a year or so and if I
feel like I keep talking about it like
on snapchat I can't stop talking about
it but it's the Missha BB cream they're
perfect cover BB cream they only have a
small number of shades because they're
used to catering to the skin types like
in Korea I'm hoping they expand their
shade range because the formula this is
so good I have it in the shade number 23
it's a very gray tone I have it on today
here's the thing it makes me it makes me
almost emotional because this is the
best face product and they should be
here I've ever tried and it's taken me a
while to realize it because I've tried
so many and every time I go back to this
one I'm like oh my gosh like my skin
looks healthy
and it covers just what I needed to
cover but not like it's a complete mask
because what I've kind of realized is
for me I'll just apply this with my
fingers all it's a little squeezy oh I
actually have a video if it's up it
might not be up yet but I just filmed to
say of me getting ready and I show
myself applying this you can see how it
looks when it's freshly applied with
nothing else on top I just squeeze a
little bit in my hands I just apply it
with my fingers as if it's a moisturizer
and it has such nice coverage for a BB
cream don't let the term BB cream throw
you off because it really does have nice
coverage it doesn't look oily it doesn't
look dry it's right in between and oh my
gosh I love this stuff so much and I've
also realized that most of us can use
this and then maybe use concealer to
cover little bits up and then that's it
you don't have to have a whole mask on
your face when really you only have a
few imperfections to cover so this evens
out my face and covers most of like you
know most of my freckles things like
that and then I can go away and if I've
got a little blemish spots and cover
those with concealer and I'm done and my
face looks just as flawless as it would
with a high coverage foundation but I
don't need to pile all that on my skin I
just don't need to it ages me
prematurely and this also has SPF of 42
which i think is pretty rad too so
that's I I love this this is $22 at
Target you can get it on other sites too
but I've seen on target and that's
probably the one I'll link below if
you're curious I've never seen it in
stores at Target though have you guys
ever seen it in stores anyway number 23
they have lighter shades but for some
reason it works really well and it was
kind of like a gamble my favorite
moisturizer it's from cosmetics it's
their humidified deep moisture and
firming hydrator this stuff is expensive
it's $90 it is the most moisturizing
best thing I've done for my skin in a
long time I'll use it in the morning
I'll use it at night I use it all the
freaking time and I'll put it on I had
it on this morning and it works really
well under makeup even though it's such
it's deep moisturizer sometimes you know
those really deep moisturizers can be
too much when you're trying to put
makeup on top it maybe looks oily this
one doesn't
it's so
deeply good deeply good and I feel like
I don't have any dryness here anymore
which is crazy like I said I've got
little bits of dryness here but that's
for the most part cleared up I love this
stuff it's $90 and I think it's worth
every penny and I think I got this from
octa Lee so I got it for free like just
to review good or bad and I freaking
love it and now I'm gonna have to buy it
which is fine because it's again it's
worth every penny so the other okay I
want to mention this is the Clarisonic
now I use my Clarisonic each night to
get the rest of my makeup off once a so
I'll use like a makeup remover and then
I'll go in with my cleanser and put it
all over and then with water kind of use
one of these to get all of that off and
it really does clean your skin well but
it's not like actually exfoliating your
skin which is good I don't want it to I
just want it to get all of that out and
that's what it does they have different
brush heads but this is their foundation
brush head and I've tried it for
foundation I really don't like it for
foundation it just doesn't work it lifts
up the dry skin I do have and it just
doesn't work for me but I do love this
to blend out cream bronzer
that's almost exclusively how I use it
now and it is the freakin best so like I
said I use it in conjunction with this
hoola contour stick and it just like
instantly it's like I guess I don't know
if you can hear it but yeah you just
like blend it and it's just like
flawless it looks airbrushed that's what
it is it gives an airbrushed effect I
haven't tried it with cream blush I
would bet it would work really well that
way as well so I've used this as well
I just said as well way too many times
with these two products so this is the
sole Etienne de Chanel I'll literally
just take the brush dip it right in
there and go in it's probably not the
most sanitary that's what I do because
it's mine and then this is the models
own sculpting glow I've been trying for
a few months I'll dip it right in there
and throw it on honestly this is
really nice I think I don't think it
stays on as long as this does but it
it's really nice so I mean this it's
it's rockin my world if you already have
a Clarisonic by the foundation brush
head if you can afford it and try it
because I think you'll be amazed now to
buy the Clarisonic and the brush head
that's expensive if you're only gonna
use it for that purpose but if you know
you would also use it for cleansing then
you could just switch the brush heads if
you wanted you know what I mean
so something to keep in mind I have also
seen Clarisonic Sai bought clear Sonics
on HauteLook before so it's like 50% off
on their just randomly it's like flash
sales so that's something to keep your
eyes peeled for if I ever see it I'll
tweet something out like hey Clara
Sonic's on there because that's probably
the best way to get it at a really deep
discount I love all of these things it's
like the happiest table of makeup ever
so something I rediscovered in my
collection is from Mac this is the Mac
pigment in tan now
don't get turned off if you heard the
word pigment you're like no thanks I
don't really use those for me when I
used to hear like loose pigment I'm like
oh my gosh no all I think of is like
fallout and I think of like it just
takes extra time cuz you need it but
it's so beautiful it's worth it and it
really doesn't take that much extra time
so what I will do to make this pop let
me grab it I don't know why I even put
it away so what I will do is I'll use
the NYX eyeshadow base and white this is
under ten bucks
amazing white primer and I'll just take
it and I'll tap it right on my lid so
I'm gonna do this on my hand so you can
kind of see so I'll just tap it on my
lid like this kind of blend it so it
doesn't look crazy but it still looks
white and then I'll take the pigment and
you can get usually they have to go size
ones which are like ten dollars instead
of twenty but this color tan is their
best pigment it is the prettiest most
wearable gorgeous pigment so I'll
literally just get a little bit on my
finger and I'll tap it on there and the
ending result is the prettiest oh my
gosh other people will use you can like
spray your brush with fix+ or some kind
of setting spray that works too but I
just noticed this is easier and then I
can just use my finger and look at that
oh my gosh so let me show you what it
looks like without it it's still
gorgeous with
the white primer I mean you don't have
to have it so this is it without the
primer this is it with it I just love
the effect that premiere but it's
gorgeous both ways so don't feel like
it's like five steps to use a pigment
and then it's that difficult it doesn't
have to be it really can be as simple as
putting the white base underneath it
just on your lid throwing it on top
blending a different you know maybe a
matte shade into your crease and you're
done it is so so beautiful it catches
the light gorgeously all day long oh my
gosh so really I could include this NYX
eyeshadow base in white as a favorite
I've used it like crazy the past two
months definitely a favorite of mine so
I'll link that below too
all right a drugstore favorite these
Milani palettes I just did a film the
eye look that I'm wearing cuz I use
these and that video will be going up at
some point again stay tuned if it's not
up if it is I will link it below but
these are their new palettes from Milani
they look guys
they look high-end look at this does
this not look like a high-end palette
well guess what they also perform like a
freakin high-end palette if not better
than a lot of the high-end palettes I've
owned so this one with the shimmers and
matte is called their bold obsessions
and like the shimmer I'm wearing today
is like this pretty orange one there
these are ridiculous let me swatch them
kind of up my arm so there are those two
shimmers oh my gosh they kick up a
little bit of powder like most things
and then I have their matte one I think
they only have these two and most loved
mattes this is what I use for really the
rest of my look on my eyes I love this
palette these mats blend like a dream of
course I swatch something really light
that's hard to see but absolutely
gorgeous palettes now they're $20 online
on milania's website but a lot of you
guys have said you saw them at Walmart
for 15 these are new they're popping up
all over the place so just keep your
eyes peeled but if I can find the link
for the $15 one at Walmart it means the
same thing I will put that below because
these are the best drugstore palette
I've ever tried ever ever I mean and
it's the color combination in the
packaging the blend ability the
pigmentation all of it is there all of
it is there and so I'm just so impressed
and even though it is more expensive for
drugstore it's worth it it's worth every
penny
this is like a rediscovered one but I've
repurposed it and then I repurpose it
again
so I'm let me explain this is the NARS
soft matte complete concealer well I
heard so many people talking about this
and the few youtubers I saw talk about
we're using it on their under eyed so
I've tried that I tried it that way I'm
like huh no no if you have dry under
eyes absolutely not so then I started
using it as an eye primer and that
became one of my favorites because it's
so really good it conceals all over its
kind of mattifying it was awesome for
that I kind of put it there it was
awesome for that and then you can get a
shade that's close to your skin tone it
is an awesome eye primer but then I
started using it for concealing spots on
my face awesome that was the original
intention but I really didn't have
anything when I was first trying this
out I didn't have any blemishes really
to conceal which is was such a blessing
but now that I'm getting like little
bits of hormonal breakouts this has been
a lifesaver I use it almost every single
day I didn't use it today but I would
put it on like these blemishes I've got
little bits of like melasma up here it
covers it up beautifully it stays on all
day it's matte so because now for me
this has a dual purpose it really kind
of became a favorite of mine when
originally I didn't like it it's so
funny so I have it in the shade
Chantilly honestly I think now that I'm
using it more for my face I could
probably go a shade or two darker
because it is a little light when I use
it on my face it works I'll blend it so
it works but I think I need to when and
if I repurchase get maybe a shade or two
up another favorites from covergirl this
is their vitalist healthy powder I did
not think I would like this and not for
really any reason but I'm just picky
with powders and I think that drugstore
like the in my head they've got this
I've got a stigma against drugstore
powders that they're always kind of more
powdery than they need to be and I'm not
Elise oh I don't need anything
heavy-duty you know oil soaking wise
soaking up wise that makes sense anyway
so I bought this with the other
covergirl stuff I was trying out and I
was like am i eating
like this you know I really really like
it it's so nice like I'll just use it
like I said I've been using the BB cream
so when I need a little bit more
coverage than what that gives me maybe
just on my cheeks especially and on my
nose I'll grab this and just dust it on
and it's the perfect amount of coverage
and mataf ocation but it's not super
matte it's so it really is nice the
packaging is cute as well on the bottom
what do they have oh they have like a
little sponge I haven't used that yet
but you know if you're on the go use it
oh there's a little mirror there too I
just noticed a little mirror on the
bottom so a really nice powder I was
really surprised I am always curious
though when drugstores come out with new
powders I'm always like did they just
take an old powder take it off the
shelves and repackage it I don't know
and I don't know covergirl powders well
enough to know if they did so if you
know let me know they might not cuz it's
I mean it's a really nice powder I'm
always curious another favorite is from
Becca this is their actually this is
something I'm pretty sure I used to own
I got rid of and then I got again and
finally knew how to use it this is the
Becca shimmering skin perfector poured
cream and it's in Champagne pop it's not
necessarily the color that I love
although I do really like this color
it's this poured cream when I first
tried this a year or two ago in a
different shade I just didn't get it I'm
like okay it's not super creamy it's not
super pigmented like what are we using
this for you know what I mean
well I finally discovered that if you
take a brush that's kind of meant for
foundation and you swirl it in there and
you just swirl it on your highlight
zones it is the most beautiful natural
candlelight glow you could ever get
you'd never get that look from a powder
it is so beautiful it doesn't emphasize
my you know like fine lines because it's
not super you know it's not powdery I I
fell in love with this stuff like the
first day I used it that way because
before I used my fingers I'm like I
don't really like it that way it wasn't
really even I tried it with like a
sponge that was also not the way I
wanted and so then when I just swirled a
brush inside
kind of swirled it on I was like it was
even it was the perfect amount and it
just looked like this lit from within
like candlelight glow
holy moly so now I want to get another
one in a different shade now this one I
bought on HauteLook it was like half the
price so let's say this was 30 I think I
got it for 15 I don't know exactly how
much it is and so now I'm like dang and
I should have got more wood shade so
I'll link HauteLook because it's very
hit-or-miss when they have stuff on
there what brands cuz it's flash sales
but you got to kind of just check it
every day I know I do alright some duds
let's talk about them
one dud is this Juno &amp;amp; Co sponge huh
okay we're to begin with this sponge
they sent it to me they sent me a few of
them it has this like furry feel to it
I'm like oh interesting and it was
saying you know it's a sponge it won't
absorb any of your makeup I'm like
that's a cool idea so I got it wet and
it was you know kind of odd but I'm like
alright and so then I apply I used it
the same way I would apply anything with
a sponge like a foundation you know it
did not look good like I couldn't get it
to do any I don't know how to describe
it it was so odd like I'm pressing and
I'm like it's still really dense so it
didn't really feel good and then they
have this flat side so I'm like well
maybe I'll use that but I couldn't get
that to actually blend it so it wasn't
soaking any up it was just you know it
would save more of your foundation
though it's not being wasted by being
sucked up by the sponge and it's
probably more hygienic that way then
when I tried to clean it I could not get
any of this stuff out so much what like
it made no sense I cannot figure this
out it's a really cheap sponge which is
really cool the packaging and everything
I thought it'd be expensive when I
looked it up I'm like oh well it's
actually really inexpensive but it just
doesn't work it just doesn't work so I
if you have this and you figured out how
to make it work please let me know but
otherwise it's either gonna be thrown
away cuz I can't I can't get any cleaner
than that I don't know so that was a
huge dud another one was from Ilya
they'd recently sent me a bunch of
products I'm trying out this brand still
I'd love to do like a brand review
because no one's talking about it but
it's at Sephora and it's a bunch of
I was reading about the company and it's
basically like a someone that someone in
her family had like really sorry I gotta
pull the little baby hairs up back here
they're tickling me someone in her
family like her brother or something
growing up had really bad allergies and
so the mom was always looking for like
skincare and things that didn't have the
allergens that would you know trigger an
allergic reaction long story short so
this is a supposed to be a really
healthy brand so I've liked a bit of
what I've tried so far but it's
expensive so I'm trying to really like
bring it through the wringer to make
sure it's worth the money but this is
their eyeliner it's it's not very good
I can maybe make it blacker by like
continuing to draw in the same spot
right but I mean every other liner
drugstore everything is way darker than
this with one swipe and for this to be
expensive and you have to have to use a
lot of the product just to get one dark
line I'm like no no no there are better
drugstore ones out there the NYX slide
on ones are unbelievably pigmented the
Rimmel scandaleyes ones are unbelievably
pigmented and those are so so cheap no
way no way so that was a huge dud and it
doesn't really stay on it smudges right
away you know I'm like no there's better
stuff out there they're gonna need to
improve that formula for sure they're
gonna charge that amount it's highway
robbery but that's why I'm here to tell
you about the crap that's out there so
you don't accidentally buy it trying to
do it last scan make sure that's
everything so those are all my favorites
for the year oh oh I promised myself I
would talk more about other stuff too
one thing I want to talk about is okay
let me see if I can grab the candle do
you guys remember back in the day
YouTube oh man I'm trying to move it
around while lit and I one of the things
got covered in wax then went out do you
remember the sweet spun sugar candle
from Target remember that everyone had
ever talked about it well it smells like
a freaking cotton candy dream it still
does and I love that these are soy
candles maybe a little bit healthier for
you umm and I wish it burned more evenly
I trim the wicks and it still doesn't
but what I'll probably do is when this
is done just put it on a candle warmer
so at least the rest of the set
can be used and then it'll kind of even
out and then be done with it but um I
love this and it was so like the day I
bought it and the day I like lit it for
the first time I was like oh my gosh
like it just brought butterflies to say
something because it made me think of
early days of YouTube and it made me so
happy
so I'm totally gonna buy this again but
I had to mention it it's that target
only and it's so amazing I got it on a
sale like I want to say around
Christmastime I'm assuming they do sales
from time to time but I I just want to
buy like a bunch of them it's such a
good sweet cotton candy smell and I had
to mention it and then the other thing I
wanted to mention was one of my favorite
music artists other than the Lord who is
my favorite still so there's this guy
named Matt Carney and I had heard about
him like I don't even know how I
originally stumbled upon him probably
like on Pandora like four or five years
ago and so I listened to all of his
albums they were so so good I loved them
and he just recently was like at the not
at the top of the charts but like in
like the pop charts for a new song he
came up with called better than I used
to be and it's so I love that song it's
it's sweet and it's just like happy but
um it's cool because his new album he
it's like an EP with just his name he's
clearly got a little bit more of a new
sound that's more fit with today's style
even though he's not like an old artist
he's you know anyway but like he has
this album called young love which is
just a really happy so happy
so they're just very very happy songs
that's she got the honey this one's
called that was called young dumb and in
love and I love that song and then he
also has he's really sweet like slower
songs and some of his older albums for
example he has this album called city of
black and white and it's so good and
everyone I know is a really good song
runaway car New York to California fire
and rain these are such good songs
where's the one though there's one that
was about like his father's father and
it is like Rochester well I've got the
goose bumps this song makes me cry so
it's his father's story from his
father's point of view about like his
debt I gotta like stop and listen to it
in a second if you listen to one song go
legit listen to Rochester I have the
goosebumps everywhere that song is so
good and it's I like songs that tell
like stories sometimes not all the time
and it tells the story and it's like oh
my gosh it's so good so go listen to
Rochester by Mat Kearney he's so good
and he need he deserves more I'm sure
he's doing okay for himself but I mean I
just love him and no one really talks
about a normally no serious and all of
his albums are so good so I just wanted
to mention that if you like me
mentioning and always save him to the
end but if you'd like me mention any
more like lifestyle favorites let me
know I can mention them more often my
favorite coffee if you're curious just
cuz I just thought of its what I'm
drinking is the in a bag just ground
coffee Starbucks vanilla and I like it
because it doesn't have artificial
vanilla flavoring I don't know how it's
not artificial but whatever they do it
really does taste different so I've
gotten like the Mik cafe bag of coffee
that's like vanilla I've gotten you know
store brand vanilla coffee and they all
even say you know artificially flavored
and you can taste it whereas the
Starbucks vanilla it's just a hint of
vanilla it's not sweet I mean it's still
black coffee but I just really really
like it I do drink black coffee most of
the time I always have creamer
everyone smile like if it's a weekend or
I just really really want to I'll put
creamer in but I really I've just gotten
used to black coffee
and it's so so good so that's another
one I can link below can you link
Starbucks coffee I'm sure I could anyway
