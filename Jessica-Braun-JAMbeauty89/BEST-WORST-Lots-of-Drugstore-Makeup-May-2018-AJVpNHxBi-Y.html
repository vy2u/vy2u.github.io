gonna talk about my may favorites the
best and the worst I've got a couple
I've got a met product a high-end
product that I was like and then a ton
of loves and actually a lot of these are
drugstore
I'm excited all of you I'm looking down
at these I'm like oh my gosh so many of
these I've loved forever I don't think I
did an April best and worse so some of
these have been piling up so I will link
endless prices for everything down below
if you're curious about any of the
things I talked about and I hope you'll
subscribe and let's go ahead and get
into the video so let's start with the
product I wasn't impressed with I feel
like I usually saved the worst but let's
talk about it let's turn on the negative
note this is from the MAC limited
edition collection I'll put on the
screen what it's called I have no idea
they very rarely send me PR and when
they do I always get excited to try some
of this stuff well I've been trying some
of the lipsticks and those are nice
you guys know my feelings on MAC
lipsticks though I just feel like
they're a little drying for what they
are but I do have some of my collection
that I do love so it's not like I just
hate all MAC lipsticks and they sent
some other stuff some single eyeshadows
i'm really liking but these are there
like bronzing powders with lines so both
of them are just kind of crummy and let
me explain why so this one's their
bronzing powder in by jana bronze i'm
not sure that i said that right and it's
a nice kind of gray toned bronzer i got
so excited when i opened this and then
the other one in the collection is their
extra dimension bronzing powder and gold
and rinse and this is a lot more kind of
warm toned with a little bit of shimmer
almost in in it here's the problem I
can't find a way to apply these where
they don't look kind of patchy both of
them and so the way I've been using them
is that as eyeshadow I've been using
them as crease colors and both of them
are gorgeous because they'll pick up
enough with a small brush that it can
look like a nice wash of bronze on your
eyes but beyond that I've tried denser
brushes looser you know less dense
brushes I don't know what's what it is
like swatching you can't swatch which
whatever again as I always say swatches
only tell part of the story because some
things will swatch beautifully and look
crazy and vise
this one swatches a little better this
is the golden rinse one but like I said
I just can't get them to look good on my
skin and I feel like these are decent
colors for someone my skintone so
there's no reason why they wouldn't look
good I don't know like I've tried this
one is a contour this one as a bronzer
I've even tried this bronzer kind of
more as a blush I can't get them to look
nice on my skin so for that reason I'm
out
all right let's stick into some of my
faves what's on my lips it is these
highly raved about these days these
L'Oreal color EES shine lip products oh
my gosh okay so they'd sent me the whole
thing and me feeling overwhelmed and
always wanting to curate my collection I
got rid of literally like all but like -
maybe all but one and the one I had kept
is the one I'm wearing glossy fawn it's
just a really beautiful kind of brownie
nude which I don't usually go for but I
kind of liked it I don't have any liner
on sometimes I think it can look a
little muddy around there but I don't
know not enough that I don't want to
wear it they're so freakin comfortable
you guys they're they're like if you mix
a lipstick and a gloss that's exactly
what it is and this is nothing new this
is not a formula that's like something
earth-shattering I feel like the Revlon
lip butters were similar to this I think
these are better I think Lori Young used
to have I don't remember what they were
called but I feel like they were very
similar to this so it's not a crazy new
formula but they're really I know what
it's like it's just like the Maybelline
Oh what were they called Oh color
whispers I freaking loved those they're
just like that so if you miss those they
still make those they're just like that
so glossy phone is what I have on and
then one that a lot of people like is
shining peach and this is one I had
actually gotten rid of and I went out
and bought again myself because then I
was like dang it Jessica
and I know a lot of you guys asked when
I get I declutter so much stuff you guys
say you know do you ever regret getting
rid of stuff I will say very rarely do I
regret it very rarely but every once in
a while like this is like one thing that
stood out that I'm like dang it I
shouldn't have got rid of it I didn't
even try it
but shining peach is gorgeous it's just
a tad I think too light
on my lips to work alone I have to wear
it with like a lipliner but if I've got
very weirdly pigmented lips if you have
normal hips like not like mine I think
you will love this because it's such a
pretty pinky shade it's got this
gorgeous Jean to it oh my gosh
so those are the two I own I absolutely
love and yeah highly highly recommend
very comfortable all right another
product that I have literally I'm
wearing it today I've literally used
every day for like a month
it's so perfect it's exactly what I was
wanting in a highlighter so if you are
tired of the really strobe be crazy
highlighters because in your everyday
life maybe you're in weird lighting
where it just doesn't look flattering or
maybe you just don't like that look you
will love these these are these new
Catrice highlighting powders they sent
these to me a while ago and when I saw
them I thought huh-huh
they look like they could be up my alley
so this one my favorite is in champagne
champagne and there's something about
this that it's it's a powder that
happens to be glowy
that's almost how I would describe it
because it's definitely a highlighter
like I would not put this all over my
face but it's it's just the right amount
so I'm wearing this right now on my
cheeks and I feel like I actually
actually I put it on my brow bone as
well kind of up here on my nose and then
of course in those traditional highlight
areas I love this it's just I could go
crazy with it and it never looks crazy
and so when you're in a hurry and you
just want that glow you want to look
like your skin is healthier than maybe
it is that's how I'm always trying to
look this is the answer because I can
just go eight with this and it looks so
nice
the other shade they have that I haven't
used as much it's a little bit more
pinky toned is Mary cherry blossom and
this one has like a honeycomb pattern on
it they have cute patterns it's still I
mean it's totally wearable for me this
is not like something I wouldn't wear
I'm just drawn to this more beige yellow
tone but this one has a little bit more
of a pure almost not white but kind of
pinkish white tone to it guys these are
so good I'm sure they're around $5
Catrice products are very inexpensive
especially compared to a lot of other
drugstore brands that are kind of
and up there they typically keep their
prices in my opinion reasonable they're
so good
there's I would recommend both but like
I said if you know you like more of a
baiji tone I would go with champagne
campaign but either way I'm so much
let's talk about what I'm wearing on my
eyes this is from wet n wild they're
limited edition so look in your stores
see if you can find them I'll see if I
can find them online I know
limited edition can be weird I'm sure
what mom's website probably sells it so
I'll see if I can find it online but
you'll probably have better luck without
having to pay for shipping by finding in
the store but these are it's from their
flights of fancy so what it's called I
think so line and I've tried a lot of
their stuff and get ready with me
recently if it's up I will link it where
I did try quite a few other things and
honestly a lot of that stuff from that
line is really nice but these really
stood out so they're they're quads and
this one's called stop ruffling my
feathers and I think this one's probably
my boo that's a toss-up I don't know
that this one's my favorite
both of these are really good so this
one stop ruffling my feathers it's got a
transition shade their eyes like worn
off most of the lettering this shade
here is really pretty but you have to
have the right brush to get actually get
it on your eyelid you can do it wet I
mean look how freaking pretty that is
though once you get it on but like I try
to put it on with my finger and unless I
have a really sticky primer it's not
going on so that's something to kind of
keep in mind but all of the shades the
shimmers are freaking gorgeous they're
ridiculous
wet and wild always they're so good
but this one I think might be my
favorite and this is what I'm wearing
mostly on my lids today or on my eyes
this one's called flock party and again
it's got a transition shade here that is
awesome if you're my skin tone it's so
easy to use it's kind of orangie but it
fades perfectly where everything looks
really like you know what you're doing
you know what I'm saying so if you've
been looking for one like that that's a
great one and then these two shimmers I
have on my eyes as well there's more of
a gold one and one that's a little more
kind of champagne E I don't have the
pink on the pink is I don't think
there's I really haven't used it to be
honest yeah it's nice but I just haven't
been drawn to use it so honestly you
don't need both however they're both
beautiful and they do have do
front shimmer colors so if you're just
looking for some really fun shimmers
with a couple of transitions so I also
put the transition from stop ruffling my
feathers in my crease like a little more
concentrated that's it and I have that
on my lower lashes that's all I have
it's just these and I freaking I love
them I think you can do a natural look
like I would like to think my look today
is pretty darn natural but you could
totally do some fun looks with it too
and they're really inexpensive so highly
recommend and I don't notice anything
weird about like the wear time with them
or anything like that they stay on all
day just like any other eyeshadow I use
another favorite is this covergirl
primer this one took me by surprise I
don't know why I have a stigma against
covergirl face products but I do and I
don't think I'm alone and I can't really
pinpoint why I've always had this stigma
that it never works for my skin it
always breaks me out I mean I know I've
had past experiences where their
foundations have broke me out like
that's probably where it all comes from
honestly but this primer really blew me
away it's their true blend based
business primer and it's their
illuminating one I like their pore one
pore filling whatever it is that's
purple I've been using that on my nose
and I do like that but this one I feel
like I can use under the maddest
foundation and it still makes my skin
look healthy so if you know that you
have matte foundations you're using but
maybe you want a little bit more glow
all over the face it doesn't make you
look like a disco ball it's nothing like
that it doesn't have glitter but it
definitely has a sheen to it and it
still will stick through through the
foundation and I just really really like
it this is one of those things that when
I have all the time in the world to get
ready I'll put on you know a facial oil
I love facial is I'll put on a facial
oil and then I'll put on a primer and
I'll put a different primer on my nose
and all but when I'm in a hurry
typically I'll put a serum on my face
really quickly I'll throw this on and
then throw my foundation on and it just
still looks really glowy frankly it
looks pretty much the same as when I
take my time with all the steps but it's
much quicker so I really was surprised
do I think you can find other primers
like this and the other drugstore brands
sure I don't think it's anything
earth-shattering but just specifically I
really have enjoyed this so I figured it
was worth mentioning
I'm gonna mention a math product and
then I'm gonna talk about 3 higher-end
products so just letting you know
they're more expensive but I really I
think I've heard you guys a lot of you
guys have tweeted me and said and
Jessica I feel like you used to talk
about drugstore more and I thought to
myself Oh Mike I guess I have I've
really kind of gotten in this space
where I've got so many products to try
and I'm reaching for like high-end
products that I've purchased with my own
money
I want to use those I spent my own money
on you know I'm a normal person with
makeup that I want to use so I'm trying
to make myself better at sharing with
you those drugstore products I am trying
because these are genuinely products
that are in my everyday makeup drawer
I'm using all the time and loving but
sometimes I forget about them when I'm
pulling products for best and worst
because I'm looking for those expensive
products that are actually worth it
because I know a lot of you guys are
curious about that too so I guess what
I'm saying in a long-winded way is I'm
gonna try to be better about making sure
I'm sharing those trucks are left with
you because I do have a lot and it's not
I don't really need to force it I just
need to make sure I'm sharing them does
that make sense
did it really I don't know that that did
okay but this is a drugstore product I
was kind of underwhelmed by this is not
a total dud
not a total worst but just a mess this
is the flower beauty lash warrior now I
love a lot of flower beauty products
they're blushes and highlighters are
amazing there I actually really liked
and a lot of people didn't they're light
illusion foundation I don't mind a
lighter foundation look so I did like
this but I know not everyone did it's
definitely a more luminous lighter
coverage but I liked it um so there's
stuff from flower I love but this was
not one of them this mascara just it was
just okay and I feel like in the realm
of mascaras today you can get great ones
for really cheap and you know this
wasn't crazy expensive or anything but I
just felt like I couldn't get the curl
like my lashes have now I just couldn't
get him to curl and stay and for me
that's kind of a big deal and so for
that reason I was like I I don't feel
like I need to keep trying this now I
will I will ask you guys if you've tried
this and you know there's like a trick
like maybe it needs to dry out longer
and then it's better because there are
mascaras like that and I totally get
that let me know because I'm not gonna
toss it or anything yet I'm gonna keep
it in my everyday makeup drawer but let
me know below your
thoughts is there a trick to making this
amazing I haven't heard people rave
about this anyway but I'm just curious
because I don't want to waste it if I
don't have to but a mascara that I
really really like but there is kind of
a caveat
it's the Lancome monster big mascara I
know that beauty with Emily Fox loves
this stuff and she does insane mascara
videos will show Trish off like 18 in
one video and show them all she's like a
mascara connoisseur she's a mascara sort
what was it in the Bachelorette the guy
was a Colonus or and I laughed so hard I
was like that cannot be a thing but I do
love perfume so I get it anyway this
stuff I I was excited I don't I think
Lancome sent it to me which was funny
because I had it in my Sephora cart and
I told myself the next time I places for
order I'm just buying it I want to know
what it's like for myself and then they
happen to send it in a PR thing this it
has a brush like I like a little bit
more traditional of a brush it's not
rubberized like the flower Beauty lash
warrior is here's the thing if you are
really good at put them out on mascara
you will love this if you are like a
beginner I think it's hard to work with
only because it can clump really really
easily so I'll still find myself I've
been doing mascara for years and years
and years and I feel like I'll still
find myself needing to comb through it
with a lash comb really quickly before
it dries but it gives insane volume
insane curl and it stays curled all day
freakin long I really like it I wish it
wasn't expensive of course and I really
find it hard to spend twenty dollars or
whatever on a mascara when a they dry
out you know they go back quicker than
other products do in your makeup
collection first of all but second of
all there are so many good drugstore
mascaras the lash paradise is one of my
favorites the L'Oreal
nope what's the one you guys know what
I'm sure some of your snake lash
princess from essence that one's even
cheaper I really really like that and so
it's hard like will I repurchase this
may be like here's here's what scenario
where I could see myself repurchasing
this I could see myself repurchasing
this if it
on sale like if they were lino maybe 20
or 30% off something like that if I had
a gift now not with a gift card I
wouldn't waste or I could see myself be
purchasing this if I were going on a
trip and I was like okay I want a really
good mascara you know I want to be able
to use the whole time because it really
is amazing but I don't think I need it
all the time because of the price point
does that make sense but I really like
it next is this Charlotte Tilbury powder
I've talked about this before but I and
I almost didn't include it but I thought
I have to talk about I freaking love
this stuff so it's the airbrush flawless
finish skin perfecting micro powder I
have it in number one fair first of all
her packaging is always ridiculously
pretty I am just about to hit pan on
this I haven't hit pan on a powder other
than like my it cosmetics like powder
foundation I put all over I even hit pan
on a powder in like forever
and I'm just about to pay on this now
only had a few months that's how much
I'm using it so I use this to set my
under eye and sometimes I'll use it on
my nose like to brighten these areas
because it is definitely lighter than my
skin tone there's no doubt about that
but I used it on my under eye today
here's what it does it's really really
finely milled so it doesn't cake up and
crepe up as much as other under-eye
powders I've used both loose and pressed
like for example I know a lot of people
like the essence like banana under-eye
powder I can't think what it's called
I'll put a picture on screen I didn't
love that I don't think it's like the
worst product in the world but I have it
in my little regrets pin in my closet
because I just felt like when I compared
it to this even though yes the essence
one is insanely cheaper and I'm all for
saving money but when this does what I
wish every powder did I'm like it's
worth the money that's what this is like
what I've been looking for so it'll work
over any concealer I use whether it's
cheap expensive doesn't matter
it adds coverage it doesn't creep up as
much now if you put a bunch on is it
gonna look a little bit cakey of course
it's still a powder but I'll just grab a
little fluffy brush and just fluff it on
there and it looks so beautiful it's so
beautiful there's a reason a lot of
people rave about this and that's why it
originally bought it and I I feel like I
will definitely repurchase it but I feel
like I don't know that I
her need another under eye setting
powder next is a skin care product and I
don't talk about skincare a lot in
favourites video specifically but I
really should because that's 50% of what
I'm doing you know what I'm saying I
feel like especially I'm 29 I'll be 30
next year I try to be really cognizant
of my skin also I'm laughing because
someone the other day someone said
something like you're 29 gosh I thought
you're like 38 I'm like oh my gosh do I
really eight maybe I do I don't know it
sucked up so funny I was like duh kind
of made me put on a little more skincare
that day anyway so this is amazing this
is from Al Jonas I had two of them Tyler
has one and when he opened ice - Tyler
smell it and so he smelled it and I said
what does that smell like and he was
like it smells like Disneyworld
Main Street and I'm like yes it smells
if you are a Disney nerd you've ever
walked down Main Street Disney World
Disneyland any of them they pumped this
certain really sweet smelling smell in
the air and you can smell it it's kind
of like cotton candy bakery like baked
goods vanilla II it smells like this now
I try not to love skin care products
with fragrance cuz it really can be an
irritant but there's something about
this smell that I'm like every time I
put it on every night I'm like oh my
gosh it's so amazing so it's what I'd
haven't even read what it is it's there
recharging night press serum
so it's has serum but it's kind of in
this you know cream if you will I don't
want to use that much cuz this stuff is
expensive but it you just put it all
over your face and it just emulsifies
right away into more of like a serum
like consistency and it is so good and I
feel like when I use it in the morning
my skin's like yes v my skin's like yes
right away but it's just packed full of
really good stuff I kind of like using a
serum that's more like a cream this is
the first serum I think I've ever tried
that was in like a cream format but I
really really have been enjoying it way
more than I thought I would and I one of
those people and I know I am I know how
terrible this is gonna sound but holla
if you hear me because
I'm one of those people that when I see
skincare products that look very
scientific I'm like mmm what why why do
I have to have the things that are like
super trendy I don't know the ones that
look scientific I'm sure like really
really good obviously
well you think what I'm trying to say is
that sometime like this is very
scientific I'm like I don't really want
to try it's not very cute like who cares
but I'm really glad I did because this
is amazing will I repurchase yes but
it's so expensive so those are all of
the best of works for the month oh I
promised I would talk more about like
skincare and stuff not skincare what am
I talking about like TV and other things
I'm really liking so um TV we just
started watching The Bachelorette for
the first time like ever and it is the
dumbest most addicting thing it's so
dumb it's so dumb and if you watch it
you know what I'm talking about you can
hear where the producers were telling
them hey say this line or hey and that's
what's kind of funny about it
but even knowing how fake and ridiculous
most of this is it's still fun to watch
we try to win I want to watch it live
that I hate watching all the commercials
so we've been watching it on Hulu like
afterwards and that's been nice because
we don't have to go through commercials
but it's fun it's a guilty pleasure kind
of fun I totally get it and so we'll see
if we keep it up but we both when we
were laughing pretty hard at the episode
last night um what else what else I
personally just caught up with the
Handmaid's Tale there is not a fun show
to watch pregnant like while being
pregnant like so that it's just been
interesting but it's a it's definitely
dramatic not for the faint of heart and
it's about kind of a dystopian future
America where because everyone you know
something happened that made a lot of
people infertile and so they've kind of
taken action to make sure that the
population doesn't die and that there's
still procreation happening with those
that are still fertile the very select
few and it is it's wild and it's scary
because you think could this ever really
happen and then you think you never know
and that's what I think is
why people are like addicted to it
because it's like gosh like this is
crazy but then you think when you when
you see how it all you know as you watch
more they kind of go back in time
flashbacks showing you how things got to
where they are today in the show you
think this could happen like do I really
things happen no I have a little more
faith in people than that but it's it's
just an interesting thought that's all
that's on the safe I'm not trying to get
political it's not at all found just and
then what else oh I just started
watching this is us why did I start
watching all these dramatic shows on us
pregnant anyway I'm not totally caught
up although my brother we were texting
about it and he ruined like the big
thing for me I'm like now in all
fairness I'm Way behind but I'm just
about to start season two and I finally
got Tyler to start watching it and he's
a few episodes and he likes it but he he
he can be sensitive when he wants to be
and so I think he's like maybe we
shouldn't watch this right now like okay
it's so good though so anyway
music-wise okay speaking of this is us
there's this song in any of the episodes
where they show William getting on the
bus and meeting his baby momma basically
I don't know if they ever got married I
don't know tocome wife whatever anyway
back in the 70s when they flashed back
to that worries me and they always play
this song blues run the game so I found
the song because I just loved it it's
I'm sure probably from the 70s by
Jackson see Frank and I have listened to
it so much that you can't I was like
okay Jessica you gotta listen to a new
song let me play it for a sec
maybe to Spain I love it so much it
gives me gustas I think it gives me the
goosebumps less because of the song more
because I I can picture what's happening
in the show when they're doing that and
how oh my gosh I don't stop just cuz I
could talk about that all day I'm gonna
stop I really like that song so that's
just a song that's been like on repeat
much to Tyler's dismay and he likes he
actually likes songs from the 70s more
than I do but that song there's
something about it just like sticks in
my craw in a good way
anyway so I think that's enough Jessica
you can stop talking for a little bit
but I hope you enjoyed I hope you
subscribe if you did definitely check
out my last best and worst from the last
month it might have been March but my
feelings are still the same if you're
kind of interested in this style of
video I will link my March 1 down below
otherwise I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
