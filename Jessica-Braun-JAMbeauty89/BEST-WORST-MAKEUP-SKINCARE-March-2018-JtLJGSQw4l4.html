to share with you my best and worst of
March so I've got a bunch of products in
front of me I am like genuinely I love
doing these videos I love sharing my
favorites I love going through my
drawers and like picking out like okay
what have I not been able to put down
this month and in some cases for a few
months
some of these are newer to me some of
these are older well it's kind of a mix
and one of them yeah one of them is like
really makes me the old-school YouTube
and I'm really excited that I love it
again and I'm excited to share that with
you too so as always I try to be as
upfront and clear with you guys as
possible when I'm being sponsored and
this video is sponsored by L'Occitane I
worked with them last month I'm so
excited to work with them again this
month now these products last month I
talked about some of their skincare
products that are freaking adore and I
feel like my face shoul skin looks like
really nice right now which is good
because I'm pregnant and I feel like
there's a anyway it doesn't matter
really like that I will link last
month's video where I talked about that
down below if you're curious but I have
been using these two products and they
have made my skin like my whole body
incredibly soft first product I can't
put down is their almond supple skin oil
first of all this has 50% almond oil in
it in it has the most incredible smell
it also has omegas and all kinds of
other oils that are amazing for your
skin they recommend putting this all
over your body which I've been doing and
I feel like my legs like everything
feels incredibly soft and bonus points
if you're pregnant and you're you know
you need that extra moisture on your
tummy as it grows that has been amazing
as well so I've definitely been using
this there what's crazy about this is
this is a really light oil it spreads
really quickly across your body and so
when I apply it I'll do it all over and
I'll use circular motions and I feel
like my skin is so smooth but it doesn't
leave a crazy greasy feeling it's not
like those thicker oils that are out
there and that's why I think I like it
cuz at night for example I'll put it on
and when I put my pajamas on over it I
don't want that feeling
like Oh your pyjamas are sticking to you
this doesn't do that to me and that is
amazing because I've tried a lot of oils
recently and all of the rest of them do
that so I know that's like a very
specific thing but just the fact that
this is really lightweight and soaks
into your skin really easily is
fantastic and to go along with it I
always put this on top this is their
almond delightful balms
so this is a body butter it's incredibly
lightweight which is kind of funny
because when I first like opened it I
thought oh it's feels like it's empty no
it was full it's just a really
lightweight and yet incredibly hydrating
formula it's really bizarre again it has
that same really amazing almond a smell
and you can put it all over your body
like I said I love even at night when
I'm just getting ready for bed I don't
necessarily put lotion on head-to-toe
like I do in the morning but what I'll
do is I'll grab a little of this and put
it on my elbows on my hands and on my
feet just those areas that get dry
throughout the day these two are amazing
on their own they're even more amazing
together so if you're interested in
these I will have links to both of them
below they are incredible and again if
you're pregnant this is amazing on your
tummy so my next favorite is I'll talk
about the old school YouTube one because
I'm sure you're curious what it is this
is the NYX butter gloss
remember these this isn't the shade
creme brulee it's actually what I'm
wearing on my lips today
now I recently declutter like everything
and if you see my recent declutter
as I sat down the other night and I was
in a mood and I de cluttered so much
like for example I had like I'm
embarrassed to say this like 67 primer
something crazy like that I literally am
now down to like eight primers so I got
rid of so much because I was like you
know what I want to curate my collection
so that when I open my drawer it makes
me happy I'm looking at a ton of
products I know I love and then kind of
designating just one drawer for those
newer products I'm trying out so right
now I'm you know in my lipgloss drawer I
have only like eight lip glosses so I
can actually see what I have and use
what I have so that's how I really love
with this guy now this is a newer
purchase for me but I used to have this
a long time ago like a long time ago
so if you saw my target live like
shopping with me kind of a halt I don't
even know what I called it that's when I
bought this and so that was a few weeks
ago and I just can't put it down it is
the prettiest pinkish creamy color but
even if you have pigmented lips like me
it still works it doesn't make them look
too muted but it doesn't look so
vivacious that you need to worry about
it looking like crazy it's right in
between it's a perfect everyday color so
creamy and I one of my favorite ways to
use this is I have a lipstick on today
this is actually from NYX as well
they're matte lipstick and whipped
caviar which is a gorgeous really really
pretty but deeper color and a little bit
drying because it is more of a matte
lipstick so what I do is I've been
putting this on and then putting the
butter gloss on top of it and it kind of
tones it down it brings it to life it
makes it more comfortable and it's an
awesome combo let's talk about an
unfavorite this is the Cokie brow
mascara I tried this in a recent get
ready with me and I'm trying to remember
like what one it just did this weird
thing in my brows where it would pull
the color through and make it look all
like splotchy and weird and then I
couldn't fix it because once it set you
know it set like a brow mascara should
they have colored ones as well this is
just the clear one and it was just weird
I've never had that experience with a
brow mascara and I think for that reason
I was like you know what I have better
ones than this I don't even care to wear
out my scare every single day but when I
do I'm not gonna futz with something
like this when they're just better ones
out there but speaking of brows I have a
new brow love that I have not put down
for weeks this is the Maybelline total
temptation brow definer I have it in
medium brown and it's got an interesting
shape it's almost triangular but
actually it's more of a kite literally a
kite we're studying geometry and my
fifth grade class right now anyway at
first it took me a while to get used to
it but it's the formula of this it I
hardly ever have to even brush through
my brows like the color disperses itself
so easily and quickly it stays in place
now if you have either oily skin you may
want to use like a setting you know like
a gel mascara of some kind I don't
because I my rule my brows aren't really
that unruly but I do notice that if I
get it on the skin it doesn't stay as
much so this might not be a cup of tea
if you are trying to fill in like areas
where there is no hair it's just skin
it's probably not gonna stay in place
the way you want it to but if you're
really just thickening and filling in
what you already have like I do you're
gonna love it because it stays in place
as long as the hair is there to kind of
hold it
am I making any sense I hope I am I love
this now my only complaint other than
that what is the spoolie it's just odd
it's kind of like a little tiny oval or
little sphere and it works it'll get the
job done but it's it's just not ideal
it's not my favorite shape so I wish
this were a little bit different but the
formula is amazing amazing amazing it's
easier to apply than my hourglass arch
brow pencil which I love I mean I've
gone through so many of those and I
still love them I still use mine but
this I think is quicker to apply which
is amazing and it's way cheaper so I'm
slowly branching into other brands that
maybe aren't as talked about as much on
YouTube and as I've done that I've
already discovered a new product that
I'm like I am so glad I did this so at
some point I mentioned pharmacy the
brand pharmacy with an F like a farm I
don't remember what video but I
mentioned that I really have liked a lot
of what I tricked my brand I have well
they're PR firms sent over a bunch of
their products to try and this was in it
this is their pharmacy skin do hydrating
essence mists and setting spray this
stuff is incredible it what I'm trying
to let let me tell you how I use it
first before I get into the actual
product so it definitely has a smell a
very kind of green
kind of a smell I mean it's literally
green - I know I know but basically it
can be used as a toner slash in essence
so it's packed full of things that are
gonna help with you know toning down the
redness kind of evening out your skin
tone helping with your pores and
shrinking them I don't know how much it
actually shrinks them but just kind of
helping the overall look of your skin
and I am terrible about doing skin care
in the morning the way that I should
when you know you're waking up early for
work and you're trying to get ready I
mean if you're like okay makeup or
skincare it's like well makeup really it
should probably be skin care but anyway
just being honest so with that in mind
what I have been doing the past few
weeks is I will come in my beauty room
I'm ready to sit down and get ready and
the very first thing I do is spray this
all over my face and I just feel like my
skin I feel like I'm doing something
great for it then I can go in with my
moisturizers and eye cream so you know
whatever I'm putting on that day
SPF etc but I feel like it's helping my
skin stay even especially when you wake
up or like for me when I first get out
of the shower in the morning and I don't
shower every single morning but when I
first get out of the shower I feel like
my skin is so red and splotchy on my
face like no matter what cuz the
temperature change and all of that and
this within a couple minutes helps to
even it out now is my skin perfect after
no that's why I'm putting on makeup and
but I do feel like it helps it's so
refreshing and I love this it's natural
skincare so they said other formulations
are free of artificial colorings so the
color of the product may change over
time but it won't affect the products
effectiveness it's safe for your skin
bubble pops so basically it's packed
with anti-natural antioxidants so it
helps promote an evenly toned looking
complexion I love this I even think the
freakin bottle like I love opening my
drawer and seeing this this this is
gonna sound crazy this is part of the
reason I went on my declutter rampage
because every time I would open my
drawer and see this I would go oh my
gosh and I'd be so excited to grab it
and spray it and I was like why do i I
should feel that way about everything I
own other than maybe those few things
I'm trying out for this channel and you
know for my job and so
this was part of the inspiration isn't
that kind of funny thank you thank you
pharmacy skin do also by the way you can
use it as a setting spray so I've done
that as well and you can use it
throughout the day to refresh your skin
I just like it best as an essence in the
morning slash time all right back down
the drugstore this is from Physicians
Formula it's their healthy foundation
now when I first tried this I felt kind
of wishy-washy about it I love the
packaging it's really pretty very
high-quality glass bottle nice big doe
foot applicator has SPF of 20 it says
it's a brightening complex hmm the
reason I felt wishy-washys cuz I was
like oh I know it's not high coverage
it's not meant to be high coverage but I
just kind of felt like I don't know like
I don't know well I started using this
like every day for like a week and I was
like oh my gosh my skin looked so
healthy now if you've got a lot to cover
this is not gonna cover it it's just not
that's not the kind of foundation it is
if you're wanting your skin like for me
you know I'm gonna be 30 next year I'm
you know I've got fine lines I've got
some little wrinkles and bits that are
kind of starting to peep through and
this is one of those foundations that
doesn't emphasize that now is it gonna
last for 12 hours and look perfect at
the end of 12 hours no it's not but what
I like about it is if I get home and on
my oh my nose is showing through because
that is always for me my my zone that
always looks crazy
I will dot like literally one dot of
this on the nose grab my sponge and
blend it and it looks flawless all over
again so this is one of those things
that you can kind of blend on top of
itself over again and it looks beautiful
you can top it with powder foundation
and you can even more coverage or you
can just wear it on its own now again if
you have oily skin same thing because it
is more of a kind of rule I like to call
these like a relaxed foundation it's
very kind of light to medium maybe
closer to medium if you put on two
layers and it's just a very chill
foundation but it's not gonna be really
great at oil control either so you got
to know your own skin and if this would
be worth trying because it is still
pricey for a drugstore so I'm really
glad I picked it back up and started
using it again because I have really
fallen in love with it for an everyday
foundation and I just dripped water all
down my shirt
talk about another duck these are from
covergirl it's their vitalist healthy
clothes I might have talked about these
before and about how I didn't like them
but I saw him in my little regrets bin
and I was like I want to mention those
again because I've had a lot of
questions from you guys about the vilest
line because they had all kinds of new
stuff they're setting spray was nice
their powder I really liked but this was
one of those things that I really was
not a fan of so I have the shade number
three and they're meant to be kind of
creamy highlighters you can see I'm
really dug in this because I really
tried it a bunch of different ways it's
just not really anything I even tried it
on my eyes not good for us but it just
didn't stay it's not meant to be used on
your eyes but then I have the shade
numbers this yeah number one which is
like a white and it just it the white
one had a lot of glitter in it which I
was like and I thought oh this could
look really gorgeous like a really dewy
wet look on your cheekbone but it really
it just didn't look as nice as I wanted
I felt like it kind of emphasized again
those little fine lines that I kind of
have my crow's feet if you will and for
that reason I was like again there are
better things out there even at the
drugstore
so speaking of better things out there
drugstore now this is not a cream but
this is a highlight I just discovered
from pixie a few weeks ago it's there
glowy gossamer duo and delicate do I've
reached for this so much I have it on
today I have the more kind of creep
creamy they're both creamy this like
more pinky toned they have a pink toned
in a gold tone but they're both if you
have lighter skin like me they'll show
up really nicely on paler skin too these
are incredibly incredibly creamy what's
funny is when I look at it I always
think oh it's got hardpan but it doesn't
but every time I look at it I think the
same thing but it's it's just so
ridiculously creamy yes it is a powder
still but I feel like you can really amp
it up and give it that like really wet
look if you want I put on what I feel
like is a lot and it's not too too wet
looking but it's definitely a highlight
you know and I really enjoy this I love
that you've got the two options I think
the packaging is beautiful I feel like
pixie
freaking killing it right now and like I
feel like other drugstore brands are
like watching pixie like oh crap like
they're coming up out of I don't want to
say out of nowhere but I mean they have
stepped up their game I don't know if
they hired a bunch of new people or what
changed but the past I would say year
year and a half they have been killing
it so I told you I would try to do a few
more lifestyle favorites each month and
one song that I'm loving that's just
like happy is by Vance joy and it's
called Saturday Sun and I'm gonna play a
second I don't know how much I can get
away with on YouTube with playing
it's so happy it's such a happy song I
always create create like playlists on
my you know Apple music where you know
I'll try to do like my season so like
spring of 2018 Summer 2018 and it's fun
to go back like a few years and listen
to like my summer of 2016 or 15 I'm like
oh my gosh the songs are still so good
or I'm like holy crap that songs already
three years old I think I could just
came out so that's kind of a favorite
music wise of mine right now if it's
Joey I do like I don't know a lot of I
don't even know if it's like one person
a band I've not investigated much but I
really like that song and what's the
other song that everyone knows by Vance
joy I'll put it on the screen you know
I'm shows we just finished up stranger
things season 2 finally if you've
watched any of our vlogs on Tyler's
channel which I will link his channel
below
we literally I feel like it was months
ago we were doing like a weekly vlog and
in it we were talking about yeah we're
watching more of stranger things and we
finally caught up with season 2 so we're
kind of tossing around ideas of what
show to start next like shameless we're
thinking about starting we've also
tossed around watching Black Mirror
because a lot of our friends watch it
and they were saying how like each
episode is like kind of self inclusive
like you don't need to watch them in
order it's kind of like um The Twilight
Zone where each episode is its own thing
it's almost like a mini movie each night
so that's something we're thinking about
watching cuz I've just heard it's really
interesting and that it is kind of like
a present-day Twilight Zone in a way
style wise so that will conclude it if
you think of anything else you want to
know like lifestyle favorites like maybe
categories you want me to try to feature
each month oh okay we recently got a
membership to Costco and I have some
food obsessions from them and let me
know if you'd be interested in us doing
like a Costco vlog I've seen some people
do like come shopping with me at Costco
and I love watching them like I'm
because I'm learning about new like
foods that they have there that I'm like
oh like I've never even looked at that
but we are obsessed with their non bread
that they sell they sell like an 18 pack
and you can freeze it you can put it in
the fridge whatever and we Tyler makes
homemade hummus and we'll warm up the
naan and then dip it in the hummus and
it is amazing like I crave it all the
time so I know
that plus chocolate milk is delicious
anyone else like salty and sweet mixed
together like I love like by - salty by
- sweet - salty if I could go back and
forth always I would that is my favorite
way to eat things anyway I hope that you
enjoyed this favorites and unfavorite
video and like I said if you're
interested in deluxe the time products
that I mentioned I will link those below
as well as everything else I talked
about in their prices and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
