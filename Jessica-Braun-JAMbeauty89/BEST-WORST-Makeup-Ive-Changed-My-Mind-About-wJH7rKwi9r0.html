going to share with you products that
I've changed my mind about sometimes for
the good and sometimes for the bad the
products that maybe I used to not like
that I now love products I used to love
that I realize you know more and more I
used it that I actually don't really
like let's go and get into it so I have
the idea for this video the other day
when I was like I couldn't sleep and I
thought of it and then I lift up those
like oh other people have already done
this and I was like maybe I didn't have
this video maybe I like saw it or I've
seen thumbnails before and it was just
in the back of my mind so then my mind
was like yeah that's totally our idea
turns out it wasn't one product that I
used to not like and I've grown to love
our the Revlon Colorstay cream
eyeshadows I did a haul of these maybe a
few months ago and when i swatched them
and even like on snapchat swatch feeds
and i was like what in the world like
why are these so bad because when you
just watch it with your hand it's just
kind of like blank like there's not
really anything there but what I've
since learned as I played with a lot of
these and a lot of you guys commented
when you use a little brush that comes
with it it makes a huge huge difference
so like right here is the one with the
brush this is without and you can
already see it's way more pigmented with
it so that made a huge difference this
by the way is in the shade and OH 7:45
it's a nice really pretty pink eye also
the shade 705 which is like a nice kind
of beige and I have a couple I have like
the green one and like the grayish one
but it's kind of somewhere lost deep in
my collection I need to reorganize my
collection so these were ones that I
thought weren't very pigments that are
kind of just dumb and kind of dull but
with the brush they really are way
better now I don't love the fact that
the brush over time you're sliding in
and out of there and even when you clean
it pretty well there's still gonna be
nonsense on there that's just inside
there I guess I probably won't have it
long enough to really worry about too
much bacteria growing in there
but it's something to keep in mind but
these I really have changed my mind
about these another product I used to
hate now I really like is the soap &amp;amp;
Glory pillow plump XXL and it says this
lip gloss will almost immediately plump
buzz tingle and zing so it's in the
shade nude in
town and I didn't like it the packaging
is kind of interesting it's like a
rubbery lip part I don't know what to
call that applicator and it really does
tingle and I used to not like that and I
I really just didn't like this product I
didn't like the way it felt I felt like
I don't know I didn't love the way it
looked on my lips but the more I wore it
the more I grew to actually kind of like
the smell of it because it is definitely
a strong like fake chocolate scent but I
kind of liked it and I really liked this
color the more I wore it I was what I
actually had brought it to school and
just left it there and so I was finding
myself wearing it more and more because
it was there and over time I started to
kind of like the smell of it kind of a
fake chocolaty smell I started to like
the shade and when I'm catching myself
in a mirror like across the room I'd
look and be like I really like the way
that looks on my lips so kind of grew
from not liking it very much so I kind
of threw it in my purse and left it at
school to trying it more and really
actually I do like it
I do it definitely has that weird buzzy
tingly feeling I like I said I've kind
of grown to like that however there are
some that I've tried not this brand but
like the Too Faced lip injection one
that was just burned I really don't like
those those just burn but this I really
liked so change my mind about that
little sucker I think I got this at Ulta
and I feel like I do not own very many
lip glosses in the squeezy tube anymore
it's like like old school to me I don't
know why next product that I changed my
mind on are the elf baked highlighters I
used to say no these are horrible these
are dumb even recently but I kept
hearing you guys say like no you have to
scrape off the top layer so I would
think I scraped off the top layer and it
still would be nothing well i
straight-up took like sharp tweezers and
just and then i realized oh now I'm
seeing pigment so this one's in
moonlight pearls and then this one is in
blush gems and I think I even declutter
this but then I pulled it out and said
now I'm going to try scraping off those
layers so there they are there and
they're so much more pigmented than they
were before now I hate that with a lot
of big products you have to scrape off
the top layer
seems like an added step that I don't
know it just seems weird to me now I do
think blush gents is way better than
moonlight pearls so this is one that you
know I don't know I've stripped off a
lot but it's a very white
not nearly as pigmented as blush gems is
there so if you're going to get one
versus the other go for blush gems but
if you've had products like this whether
it's elf or laura geller season I feel
like laura geller ones I've never had to
scrape off the top and a lot of those
are baked so I don't know I don't know
if there's a way elf could like in the
factories once it's baked scrape off the
top layer like with the machine or
something so that way when you actually
receive them they're ready to go because
I could picture someone that doesn't
watch YouTube videos that doesn't look
things up like this online I could see
them trying this and being like this is
junk and throwing it away you know what
I mean so just something that I think
else needs to think about the next
product is a more expensive product and
this is from a cosmetics and it's the
bye-bye pores I used to not like this
and a lot of people when they first got
it really liked it but I tried it and I
was like what in the world like why is
everyone talking about this so much why
do they love it so much
well I realized and if you've seen my
primer declutter I was like sorting this
and it's like it was a very runny
consistency and I'm just like why does
everyone like this well I realized as I
primed it more and more that it actually
shouldn't be that runny it should be
more like this and the entire time I've
been using it it was this weird runny
formula and I just figured that was the
way it was I hadn't really dug that deep
I hadn't watched a lot of reviews or
anything then I once I finally got it
going and like I had to get rid of a lot
to finally get to like the thicker part
of it but then I realized how nice it
was so I would put that on my face and
it was so perfecting and this is one
that even though I have dry skin I can
put this all over my face and it
completely evens it out no matter what
foundation I put on it it looks
instantly better it lasts longer
throughout the day it the foundation on
top of it doesn't break apart I mean in
it's so soft and it very it very much is
its own thing like I really haven't
tried a lot of primers that are like
I would say the closest thing is like
the hourglass mineral veil primer that's
very similar to this I think I might
like this one better and I like the
packaging too now that it's working for
me another product I very recently
changed my mind about is the essence
lash princess so when I first tried this
I hated it I couldn't figure out why
everyone was like oh yeah to do for the
superhero mascara which I love the it
cosmetics superhero mascara is my
favorite mascara of all time so I'm like
what like I kept trying it and for like
a week or two every time I tried it my
lashes would either clump together or
they just wouldn't do anything they
wouldn't you know it was just bad all
around bad so much so that I did a kind
of haul review type video and when I
uploaded it and well when I edited it I
knew that since then I changed my mind
so I had to put like a little blurb
saying that actually I've tried it and
it's better but then even when I filmed
it it was still terrible well it must be
one of those mascaras that needs time to
dry out because once I use this after
that it's like it has three weeks or so
to dry out and it is amazing and it is
similar to the it cosmetics superhero I
don't think they're exactly the same and
again I want more time with this but I
did a complete 360 on this and you know
if you've ever tried mascaras where like
later on you try it again you're like
what in the world is way better it
usually is because it's a formula that
just needed to dry out just a little bit
so that it works the best which sinks
kids anyway but the packaging kind of
cute you know that's kind of like
three-dimensional and I bought mine at
Ulta it's really really cheap like
around five dollars and I was very
impressed so if you're wanting to try
the superhero you like volume eyes very
curled lashes that actually stay all day
and this does stay all day this is one
that you should definitely consider
because it's really cheap and I was
blown away I put my foot in my mouth for
that one alright next product I have two
elf products there are a lot about
products that I feel like I tried years
ago and they must have redone the
formula because they're way better now
than they were then one of them is the
elf lip exfoliator it's now one of my
favorites and I see exfolia exfoliator
it's now one of my favorite products and
a long time ago if you've seen my
old elf videos you know I do best and
worse and it was on my worst list but
the reason I used to not like it is
because the exfoliating part there'd be
more of that and less of the balm so
after you use this like two or three
times to exfoliate your lips it would be
only harsh granules and no balm and so
it was just really like too rough on
your lips then it would start to kind of
break down and chunks would come off and
I'm like what in the world why why am I
even spending a couple dollars on this
well they've reformulated it I'm pretty
sure because now there's way more balm
now I do still put a lip balm on before
I use this just so it has something to
work with
not just on my dry lips but it's way
better now they have a couple different
like colors not only colors like since
this is the cherry one they have like a
rose one and mint one same for this one
I think so
they got all eyes but I like all of them
I don't really have a favorite out of
all of those they're all really good and
I always bring something like this to
travel with just engage your lip skin to
super dry eyes how long have I had this
nonsense in my hair another mascara that
I'm wearing today that I changed my mind
on is this Clarins mascara so it's
pricey I got it from octa Lee where you
can get free products on there if you
don't know about it I can link the
website below a lot of people use it
it's a really cool website but when I
fir again this must have needed time to
dry out because when I first tried it
the first two weeks it was way too wet
like it didn't hold the curl it didn't
really do much it didn't even really
volumize my eyes but now that I've tried
it more I'm wearing it today and let me
zoom you in so you can see I feel like
it really is holding a curl I've been
wearing this now I've been filming a
while now for a couple hours at least
but even at the end of a work day it's
still curls I mean this stuff really
really blew me away and it does a great
job of not clumping it just keeps
building I had like three layers on and
it just kept building beautifully on top
of it but it did need like three weeks
to dry out another product that I've
changed my mind about and this might
shock you guys is the MAC lipstick
formula I own quite a few MAC lipsticks
I've decluttered some and then I get
more and you know I bought more and what
I've realized is
this formula is incredibly drying I
could mine lips could be perfect in the
morning I could put it on in a few hours
maybe reapply my lips are so dry and you
know I've realized for the price there a
way better lipsticks out there for
either the same price or for even
cheaper and so I feel like this is on
par with like the Rimmel lipsticks where
they're pretty good for the price but
they are drying these remind me so much
of those these might have a little bit
more pigment to them depending on the
shade but they're really not a great
lipstick and they don't last long
they don't really make your lips look
great and unless you find like a shade
that you did that just speaks to you
that you love there's really no reason
to go out and buy these so I might also
mention these I'm filming today a video
about products I regret buying or
disappointed I might mention these in
there in a little more detail but I want
it I almost didn't mention it but I
wanted to mention it because I feel like
they get so much hype but they're really
not good lipsticks so that's kind of you
know I used to love them and wear them
all the time but every time I travel
with them and put them on I instantly
regret wearing it so I've just got to
stop myself from buying any more so
hopefully this video was helpful to
watch it it's fun to watch I like doing
this kind of a video if you enjoyed it
let me know and definitely subscribe
before you leave and I hope you'll catch
me on my social media which is right up
there in the meantime and come say hi
other than that I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
