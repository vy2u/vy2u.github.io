my July favorites and fails I have a
fail that I think will really surprise
some of you guys and it's not a 100%
fail but I'll explain in a minute so if
you enjoyed this kind of video I hope
that you will subscribe I do lots of
drugstore makeup videos as well as
high-end kind of a mix and other than
that let's go ahead and get into it I am
in my new house by the way this is the
room that I'll be filming in I just
filmed today kind of an impromptu
behind-the-scenes of like how I set up
the room what equipment I'm using with
links and all that stuff and a lot of
it's decently affordable so if that
video is up I will link it below we've
got a lot of products again this is a
mix of drugstore and high-end let's
start with the drugstore product this is
the elf Beauty shield and it's their
antioxidant enriched skin protection
vitamin C pollution prevention serum I
remember when I was taking my first
makeup class back like my first or
second year in college in Chicago our
makeup teacher telling us that you know
if you ever step foot outside your house
or apartment you should have something
on your face protecting it even if you
don't wear makeup every day cuz this she
was an amazing makeup artist that she
didn't wear makeup I mean she just
didn't she was good at the art of it but
it wasn't something she wore on her face
all the time but her skin was amazing
and she would say that that is like one
of her biggest things was always have
something protecting your face not just
SPF protection but just protection
against the elements you know the second
that air hits your face it's it's
messing with your skin and so I love the
idea of this so their description is
it's a lightweight hydrating serum and
it's formulated with key antioxidants
vitamin C vitamin E and pomegranate
extract to help refine and brighten skin
tone reduce the look of fine lines and
help protect against the effect of
everyday environmental aggressors so you
can use it morning and night I've been
using it just in the morning I use a
different serum at night right now but
the packaging is very like it's very
luxurious for elf and they've really
gosh
you know I love elf there are some
products I don't like if there's I have
found some of my favorite favorite
favorite
from ELF anyway so it's a nice like
glass bottle glass type bottle and you
push the button down and it sucks up the
serum and you usually just apply like
four drops just all over my face really
lightly and even on my under-eye I just
love it it works really well under
makeup it is lightweight and I feel like
I'm doing something good for my skin the
second I'm about to start applying
makeup and so this is always the first
thing that touches my skin and I love it
I'm going into this weird habit of every
time I drink tea coffee anything somehow
I like tip it too fast where I get it
like dribbled down the side of my mouth
how does this keep happening another
product I've been wearing on my face
pretty much all month this and my
lineage compact which I really like as
well there are a lot of Laneige products
I'm loving but I did a separate video
about these products so I will link that
below I'm not going to mention them in
this video because I didn't want to keep
mentioning the same products anyway this
bareMinerals complexion rescue I have it
in the shade wheat 4.5 I probably could
go lighter but because it's more of a
tinted moisturizer it still works really
well this is one that I had a while ago
and I didn't really use very often but
once I got this into my regular rotation
I was like oh my gosh it makes your skin
look so healthy it's got decent coverage
not like high coverage like the
cosmetics CC cream but enough that I
feel really good going out I feel like
my skin looks healthy and it gives it
this kind of dewy like effect and it's
just moisturizing I've just fallen in
love with it so this is one of those
things that once I work through more of
my tinted moisturizers I would totally
buy this again I really really was
impressed with it the next product I did
a separate video on and if it's up I'll
link it but I had to mention it anyway
it's the L'Oreal voluminous lash
paradise I could go on and on about this
mascara guys it's the best mascara in
the drugstore hands down I'm wearing it
today of course I did a much lighter
like kind of everyday look today but I
can't put this down I've totally pushed
my it cosmetics superhero mascara to the
side I still absolutely adore that stuff
but when this is so much cheaper and
it's amazing the second you open it it's
just voluminous and you're
she's just I've got so many compliments
of people that I see in person when I'm
wearing this they're like what's on your
lashes so I'm WOW like I didn't know is
I knew it was dramatic like to me when
I'm looking at myself in the mirror like
wow they look really good but for other
people to notice it too that says a lot
about it so I can't speak highly enough
about it let's talk about the dud Urban
Decay's sent this to me I love a lot of
urban decay products now I know I never
know how to talk about certain cult
classics cuz I don't want to offend
people that love it this is not a bad
eye shadow palette generally the quality
is good urban decay shadows are amazing
I have all the other naked palettes I
love them all I use them all and that
goes the same for this let's talk about
some more pros the packaging is
absolutely beautiful it's like a thick
plastic but I still think it feels very
high-end it's magnetic closure it's
beautiful it really is it comes with a
mix of matte and shimmer as they always
do and my biggest gripe is not the
pigmentation I do think that there are
some shades that are just okay they
don't show up as well as you'd want them
to but generally I mean there's still
good quality do I think it's as good as
like the original Naked palette maybe
not as good when it comes to the quality
of all the shadows but that's okay it's
still really really really good however
my biggest gripe is that so many of the
shades look the same this there's he
devil there's cayenne and and Fuego
these when you're blending them onto
your I end up looking so similar there's
the three of them there they you know as
you're using a fluffy brush or whatever
and you're blending it they all three
look the same on my eyes and you know
I've tried it with different primers
because obviously if you use more of a
white primer it usually shows things
true to color and even still as I'm
blending they end up looking the same I
appreciate that they have some lighter
medium matte colors to blend things
together I feel like a lot of their
other palettes missed that part and they
did a great job with that but you know a
lot of the shades are pretty but I just
feel like when you're spending over $50
for a palette every single shade should
totally be its own thing
know that something that's very very
particular that's not gonna bother a lot
of people and if you can honestly look
at this palette and think I will use
almost all of those shades then it's
probably a worthwhile purchase if you
know yourself and you're just wanting to
get it because you're like well it's the
new Naked palette I should have it I
have the other ones but you know when
you look at this that you're not gonna
wear most of these you don't need to
spend the money you just don't if you
need someone to tell you that I can be
that person for you you don't you guys
know whether I sense something or not
I'm always honest and this is the case
that they did send this to me and of
course I'm grateful I got some other
things from them that I absolutely adore
but this was just one that I think it's
one that you can easily pass on if you
know it's not your style I hope that
made sense but it's not a terrible
palette by any means alright let's keep
going
a favorite of mine it's this all May
instant glow highlighting - oh so this
is in the shade soft glow and I know I
have the other shade of it somewhere as
well anyway but this is the one I've
been using a lot so it has this side
that's like a highlighting stick and
it's just a really pretty very ivory
they have different shades you could get
one that would look better on your skin
tone I love this because I'll just grab
a little bit on my finger and just tap
it right there and you can see it just
adds that little bit of glow now I gotta
even it up and you really don't have to
push very hard you don't have to try
very hard it's just really really pretty
so I've been loving that but I've been
doing the same thing with the other side
the other side is like a liquid
highlighter the same kind of a shade but
I think it can look even more natural
because it is that liquid so you can
just blend it onto those same areas I'll
even put it on the tip of my nose a
little bit and I just think these end up
looking so much more natural than powder
highlights
I love powder highlights I have a ton I
will always love them but I've really
gotten into more creamy liquidy type of
highlighters I think just because it's
summer and the sun shining on you and
you don't necessarily want to look
powdery and any extra powder you're
putting on your face is just gonna look
that much more cakey in the sunlight and
so for me I've just really gotten into
this kind of a highlight and I was very
impressed I feel like all May has so
many good products that we don't all
take the time to look at and buy in the
store but they
this was amazing another love of mine is
this new cover FX mattifying setting
spray
so it's summertime it's hot out I'm hot
even in the house sometimes and so for
me I like that glowy look I don't really
go for a super matte look very often
because I have naturally dry skin as it
is so I'm kind of like tired of that
kind of look so I was kind of like boom
a mattifying setting spray for dry skin
I don't know but the way I've been using
it is about halfway through the day my
skin will be a little bit more oily than
I want it to be but I don't want to put
powder on top of it just to kick it up
like I was mentioning so I'll spray my
face with this and I feel like it does
such a good job of mattifying but not so
much that I feel like I'm completely
matte so if you're like me I actually
think you would like this I'll do it
right now I'm not super like sweaty
right now but and this brayer is really
good too
I feel like it does a great job of kind
of melting everything back together
mattifying just a little bit but not so
much that you look like you are
completely matte because like I said I'm
not a big fan of that now if you've done
a matte look on your face and you do
this it's it's probably still gonna look
really matte for you but because I'm
starting with a non matte look I think
it just it adds the right amount does
that make sense am i over explaining it
I probably am I just really really like
it because I think a lot of setting
sprays you spray on and they make your
skin look so much more dewy than you
actually want and so it makes me not
want to use setting sprays all the time
but this for me is the answer to my
prayers so I really really like it I
think it's perfect for summer also I
mean I feel like you just see what I
feel like if I were to have sprayed any
other setting spray I would be all oily
especially right here in my t-zone but
with this stuff it really does soak up
the oil I can't explain it I don't know
what magical ingredients are in it but
it blows my mind
okay next favorite is this Brazilian
crush this is from Sol de Janeiro
Janeiro
it's Janeiro well here in America we say
Rio de Janeiro but I know it's
pronounced differently if you're
actually from there anyway
um I already love there bumbum cream
it's super pricey but it's so luxurious
it smells amazing and
makes your skin like it helps it look
just a little bit tighter and it
definitely makes it look glowy I love it
on my legs in this summertime love it
and I keep like running through it and
I'm like oh I gotta buy it again it's so
good it is so so good this stuff has
it's a body spray but it has the smell
of that stuff
oh it's literally summer in a bottle if
you like coconut and that kind of a
smell but it's it's not just coconut
it's like a mixture of things that you
can't describe but it's like they
captured everything from the beach and
made it into this amazing spray this
smell is the same as that bum bum cream
it is so so good it's a huge bottle it's
perfect in the summer cuz I don't always
want a heavy perfume on you know there's
I don't know maybe I'm weird about
summertime but I just don't like a lot
of heavy makeup
I don't like heavy perfumes so for me
this is the perfect like spring summer
and early fall kind of a scent that I
can just spray all over and it just
smells fresh and beautiful and nice and
coconutty but it's not so much that I'm
like oh it's making me feel sick to my
stomach it's not make sense so this is
awesome for that purpose it's great to
throw in a gym bag if you just want to
freshen up it's great to keep it work I
just really really like it
so much if you know the smell of that
and you like it you will love this it's
called Brazilian crush and I even say
that I don't know okay so next favorite
is this concealer I bought it while I
was in oh maybe use at the airport going
from Ireland to Spain it's a bourgeois
concealer it's their radiance reveal and
I got it in the very lightest shade I
probably could go a shade up it doesn't
look like anything special upon first
glance it's just a doe foot you know
super light concealer the shade I got
and it does have that kind of bourgeois
smell not a bad smell but it definitely
is a noticeable smell so if that bothers
you you won't like this but what I love
about it is it really is radiant I'm
wearing it today and I feel like when I
do lighter eye looks if I'm not
brightened in that area I feel like it
just makes me look like I didn't put in
an effort even when I did so something
like this is a great job I actually put
it not only here but even I even blended
it onto my eyelid
is kind of a primer a brightening base
and I think it works so well it blends
in so beautifully it really is radiant
without any glitter no shimmer and I've
done it with the beauty butter I've done
it with like where is the brush I used
today a classic like foundation kind of
brush that I never use I used it for
that today and it did an amazing job I
feel like I've used it with so many
different things and it always blends in
beautifully you can just use your
fingers and I just think it looks nice
let me look at it up close see how it's
wearing okay so it does sink into fine
lines I've got very pronounced fine
lines it's just hereditary you know I'm
28 and I feel like I look a little older
than that just because of that but you
know I do everything I can skincare wise
to try to prevent it but some things are
just hereditary and because of that you
know every concealer sinks into them do
I think it's noticeable from like this
far away no but you know if I'm looking
at it this close yeah I can see that
it's sunken but I still love this stuff
so much so if you can get your hands on
it I'll try to find a us link I really
don't know cuz Bourjois is not really
sold here yet so I'm saying yet I've got
a growth mindset I hope it will be sold
here soon okay the last favorite is this
Paint Pot from Mac it's an Indian wood I
don't know if it was a recent favorite
or not I talk about it all the time I
did a 5-minute kind of get ready with me
video a tutorial on how to get ready
really quick and what my favorite
products are for that and this was what
I wore on my eyes this is the only thing
I wore my eyes this has been my go-to
because I'll just get a little bit on my
finger tap it onto my lid and then I'll
just grab a fluffy brush and I'll blend
whatever I already put on the lid just
kind of blend it into the crease it
looks like you have like four eyeshadows
on it makes it look like you've really
done an eye look when all you did was
put this on and blend it and it takes
like 30 seconds there's something about
this shade so if you have a skin tone
anywhere near mine you would love it
they have tons of different shades so if
you're darker or light or whatever you
could find different ones that would
work maybe a little bit better for you I
think the key is that you know it needs
to be maybe a little bit deeper than
your skin tone enough so that you know
it almost looks like there are different
dimensions
you're also blending it into your crease
it's so beautiful when I run out I'll
buy it again because it's just my go-to
it's so quick and easy and beautiful and
it does not at least for me I don't have
super oily eyelids but I don't need an
eye primer with it it just stays in
place so those are all of my favorites
and fails for this month if there are
any products out there that you would
like me to review try out whether I do a
separate review video on it or maybe I
just include it in a favourites or fails
etc please let me know what you guys are
interested in there's so many new things
popping up all the time and yeah I just
I'm excited to be settled in my new home
enough to be able to film for you guys
I've missed you guys so much
and let me know what you'd like to see I
hope that you'll subscribe if you
enjoyed and I'll see you guys in my next
