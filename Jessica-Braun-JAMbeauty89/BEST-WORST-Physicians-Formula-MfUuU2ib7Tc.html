gonna share with you the best and worst
of what I've tried from Physicians
Formula positions formula is sold here
in the States in a lot of drugstores not
every drugstore but you can find even
more online and so actually a lot of
their newer products that I've tried I
ordered from them online because you can
never really gauge when it's gonna
suddenly appear at whatever stores
nearest you and I really didn't want to
wait but as I perused the physician's
formulas site which I'd never bought
from their website before you know I had
a there was a promo code at the time so
I got like free shipping and then there
was a percent off so in the end I ended
up probably saving more money than I
would have buying it at the store anyway
and that was kind of cool and that was
kind of new to me cuz I I don't know
that I've ever bought just from like a
drugstore brands website I think that
was the very first time no I know that
was the very first time so so that was
kind of interesting something to think
about when you're shopping online but
I've tried I have some older products at
there some newer ones some that I
absolutely love some that I think you
should stay away from I don't think are
very good and then just some other
things about the brand that I you know
I've been thinking about that I wanted
to share with you guys as well so if you
enjoyed this kind of video definitely
subscribe and give this video a like if
you enjoy this style and let's go and
get into it alright so let's start with
some things that I do like I'm wearing a
lot of this on my face so I'll of course
tell you what I'm wearing as I mention
it one of the newer products that I
really really like is in this like
really pretty rose gold packaging it's
their organic rose oil lip polish now
the idea behind this whole brand is that
it's supposed to be more healthy
ingredients now I don't know that that's
true across the board they are a little
bit pricier for drugstore although now
most other drugstore brands are kind of
raising their prices and it's starting
to match physician's formula because to
me especially like I think back to when
I was in high school in college and I
really couldn't afford a lot I would
look at Physicians Formula and pine
after it because it was so expensive you
know what I mean and I wouldn't buy it
because of that and I still think it's
kind of expensive but now everything
else is like matching it which stinks
but this is a basically a little lip
exfoliating tub it's it's just really
nice I like it better
it's kind of like a sugary scrub and it
has it doesn't really have a strong rose
scent which I like because I'm not a big
rose person we'll talk about that in a
little bit I don't hate the smell of
rose but it's not my favorite you know
but it's definitely more of a sweet
smell even though if they say it's a
rose oil one but I feel like it does a
really good job of exfoliating now this
is not gonna be a deep exfoliation but
if you just got kind of like weird
Krusty's it knocks them right out of
there and that is what I like because I
feel like all the time especially the
winter I sleep with like this humidifier
I'm probably like the ugliest sleeper in
the world because I sleep with a
humidifier I get really really dry nasal
passages like many of us do when the
heat is on in the winter so I feel like
a lot of times I sleep with my mouth
open just in the winter and so when I do
that I think I could get weird lips I
don't know so I feel like this is a
great job in the morning of just
sloughing off all of that you know
excess skin that you don't really want
on there and then my lips are ready for
whatever so I use this today before
putting on this lip product which I will
mention it is a Physicians Formula one I
really really like it and I've tried
milania's version of this and I really
like that as well I think I like this
one a little bit more I like the
consistency of it and they look very
similar like the Milani one and this one
the pots are like almost identical next
product I wanted to mention is another
one I'm wearing this is their bronze
booster
it's the matte sculpting highlight in
contour palette they also have a broad
like a shimmery one I really like this
so I'm wearing the bronzer shade lightly
kind of up near my hairline I will say
this you do have to use a light hand
with this if you're anywhere near my
skin tone because it is definitely like
it definitely packs a punch it's very
very deep which can work I say deep
compared to my skin obviously it's not
gonna be deep for everyone but you
definitely need to use light hand if
you're my skin tone but the contour
shade I used you know just kind of to
contour my cheekbones just a little bit
doesn't always swatch the best but it's
really really nice and the cheekbones I
love it and then this matte kind of like
vanilla shade I used today to set my
under eye at least this portion kind of
as a
highlight before I put on my other
highlight I used something different to
set my eyes and elf product but I really
really like this I think for what you're
paying you're getting three really good
products and I think that's pretty cool
it's prime know it is definitely the
best contour kit I've tried from the
drugstore next product is totally a dupe
for a really expensive product and this
one might be even better this is their
spot light illuminating primer the
packaging is gorgeous this is one of
their newer ones kind of has this silver
to pink kind of rose gold eyelid really
nice glass bottle this is totally a dupe
for the Becca backlight priming filter
which I really actually like I own I've
compared these and I'm working on a
dupes video and I'm sure I'll include
this one I put this on my face before I
put my foundation on and the foundation
I'm wearing is also Physicians Formula
one but this just such a beautiful job I
put it all over I treat it kind of like
a primer like a true primer all over my
face and it just gives this really nice
subtle glow it actually makes your skin
look really nice even alone but I like
to put foundation on top of it and it
just I mean look at that it's so pretty
I'm really into this style of kind of
primer II like not shimmery but like
kind of glowy primer like this because I
do think especially in the winter it
just really helps our skin look more
alive because I feel like if you're used
to putting a lot of matte products that
really makes your skin look a lot more
dull and I think this kind of brings the
life back to it so I'm really a fan of
this I'm pretty sure I like it better
than the Becca one still kind of trying
them out but I was very very very
impressed with this and the packaging is
gorgeous like this is worth their hire
drugstore price tag absolutely so the
foundation I am wearing is their new
healthy foundation I have two shades and
actually just mixed them this is LC one
and lw2 so they have cool and warm tone
once the packaging really nice glass
bottles very heavy duty they feel nice
the way you apply it is it's a giant
dosa which I don't mind the only thing I
will mind is
we get farther down I might have to pry
the thing out of it just to be able to
dump the rest because there's no way the
doe foot gets every last bit of this out
but it's nice I just kind of paint some
stripes on my face and then do the other
color with the same thing here's the
thing it's SPF of 20 it says it's got a
brightening complex
I feel like this ends up making my skin
look kind of matte and dull which is
very surprising for me considering it's
called like healthy and like what I
picture is something bright and healthy
and radiant and that's not what this
does for me at all even when I put it on
top of this spot like primer like I did
today and I can't really figure out why
because I just feel like it shouldn't
look the way that it ends up looking on
my skin I've applied it with a blender
and the blender really does soak up too
much of this cuz this is kind of a
lighter formula and a brush is what I
use today and I feel like it just kind
of the brush kind of lifts up my dead
skin I'm kind of realizing and just kind
of gets the foundation all mixed in
there and it doesn't look as good so I'm
still kind of toggling with how to apply
this it might be best applied just with
your fingers our fingers really are a
magic wand and they can do such a good
job of applying so many things like BB
creams and tints and moisturizers and
this kind of reminds me of a tinted
moisturizer maybe with a little bit more
coverage so it probably depends on your
skin type I think if you had oily skin
this might actually be kind of more
brightening and stuff but if you've got
dry skin for whatever reason it just
kind of like enhance that and that made
me sad so it really did because I was
like oh my gosh this sounds amazing I
love the packaging of course I'm gonna
keep trying it letting you guys know how
I feel about it but I've been trying
this now for a month and a half and it
really kind of looks that way every time
I apply it so let me know if you've
tried this you figured out a secret
trick to make it work for you I don't
think it's terrible so if you're looking
at you're like no I think I want to try
for myself I think I don't think you'll
be that disappointed but it's certainly
not one of my top foundations I've ever
tried I can say that with certainty so
let's talk about a product that was I
think a dud you'll all explain what I
mean this is there Lavelle vut
foundation
it's like a cream compact foundation my
gripe with the brand just in general is
this is their lightest shape ivory this
is orange my gripe with them is that
they really don't have a large shade
range for virtually anything even
thinking about like contour and stuff
this is not going to work as a bronzer
and contour for everyone and they really
don't have another shade option they
just have a shimmery version their
foundation range does not go as deep as
it should so this brand and there are a
lot of drugstore brands that are like
this they really do not cater to
everyone and I do have a problem with
that and even when you know with like
lighter I'm like oh that's awesome you
know I can get over the fact that this
is too dark but it just seems crazy that
they would even release this and call it
ivory just change the name if you don't
want to release the shade light enough
okay you know obviously you're not
releasing dark enough shades but don't
call it ivory because that's not you
know what I'm saying so I don't know I
think Physicians Formula needs to work
on their shade range not just with this
but I mean just with any of their color
products but you know other than that I
couldn't put it all over my face but it
was definitely a more like I could see
how this would kind of pull at your face
um it's it's not super creamy so I don't
think it's gonna be easy to blend all
over your face I might have you think I
almost could use this as a bronzer but I
think it might look a little Donald
Trump II you know kind of orange alright
next thing I wanted to bring up is
what's on my lips this is another new
product it's from their kind of healthy
line um so they're the healthy
foundation this is their the healthy lip
and these they claim to have a velvet
finish 100% agree I bought three shades
so I bought Coral minerals bear with me
and vitamin beat I'm wearing vitamin
beat holy cannoli
these are I got a lot of comments
from you guys laughing at my holy
cannoli comment these are the most
comfortable colors you could put on your
lips and they stay in place
I hesitate to call them on liquid lips
because I mean they are but they're so
comfortable there is transfer like that
was I've had this on maybe 20 minutes or
so you know they're still transfer but
it's not to the point where you're ever
gonna be worried about it going outside
your lip line like ever now I did use a
lip liner with it not one of the ones
I'm well I'm not showing any lip liner
today but I would say definitely wear a
lip liner with it unless you're super
careful I mean you could maybe line but
it dries down but it's comfortable it
feels like I'm wearing a lip balm right
now I never quite experienced this there
are some other lip products from the
drugstore of like that are more whipped
in nature and I really do like those I
like these better so now I want to see
like do they have any lighter shades
these are a little bit more like normal
so bear with me is kind of a orange II
almost Brown kind of a color maybe more
orange than brown and then coral
minerals is of course a little bit more
coral I've tried all of these on my lips
I really enjoy them do I need to reapply
them over time yeah of course which I
don't mind doing but because I'd rather
do that than deal with like gross crusty
you guys know I'd rather reapply but I
just they're so comfortable I'm sorry
you keep seeing me look down I'm looking
at a mirror here to like see it's so
comfortable and you can almost in the
weirdest way you can almost see your
lips behind the color but in like a
healthy way like I feel like it makes it
look like in like it's my lips even
though I I mean obviously we all know
it's not but I don't know how else to
describe it you've gotta try to know my
teeth know you've got to try one go to
the store if you can see it pick out a
shade and try it I think you'll get what
I mean it really is like in a league of
its own Pinocchio
come on alright I clearly have a lot of
products I love I promise I'll get to
some ones that I don't cuz there are
some but I I'm genuinely kind of
impressed by a lot of their items so
another new one is their refreshment
cucumber and bamboo Ida puffer I've been
using this every morning for a while I
am pregnant and I feel like I'm
we're tired when I wake up in the
morning than normal which I guess makes
sense I am growing a human and I love
this stuff it's not too thick like I've
got the milk makeup one and I do like
that it's a similar idea but it's so big
I'm like trying to fit it around there
and you can put it all over your face
but I really like this and that product
just around my eyes it glides on so you
don't feel like you're pulling on your
eyes that early in the morning but it
just kind of it doesn't really tingle
but it kind of just feels cooling and
nice do I think it's doing something
long-term for my skin no but do I really
enjoy the feeling and kind of that
little boost of hydration right when I
get ready yes I really do I think the
packaging is cute and I think it's
absolutely on par with the milk makeup
one and it's half the price so I would
totally like if I ran out of both I
would repurchase this one it's easier to
use the same effect and I actually like
the packaging a bit more I think it's
really cute all right so another product
that I use today is their Rose day all
day oil-free serum so it says it's
oil-free pearl luminous formula it helps
tighten and brighten skin for a radiant
glow has rose water to help soothe calm
and hydrate formulated with antioxidant
rich goji and Kakadu plum cacao I don't
understand the richest vitamin C source
of any fruit so it says it can be used
alone under or over makeup over I tried
once to kind of tap it like maybe like
in the high points and it really kind of
messed with the foundation under so I
wouldn't recommend that but it's you
know got a dropper bottle
it's the dropper is not very good like
I'll notice there's still more product
in there and I can't squeeze it out of
there so that kind of stinks I mean it's
okay it gets the job done but it's got
this white hue to it and then it kind of
turns into this kind of pearlescent
color I love this stuff I really do to
be honest with you it reminds me a lot
of the same effect as this and if I were
recommending one versus the other I
would recommend this like if you're
because you really don't need both now
this one's a primer this one's a serum
but I don't know I mean obviously this
has more ingredients in it that are
better for your skin so if that's what
you're looking for then definitely but I
think at the end
the day this gives a prettier look to
your skin throughout eh you can use both
I use both today so I use this first
kind of let it set if you will and then
I put this on top just cuz I was like I
really want a lot of glow and you can
even see it's not like crazy Chloe you
know what I mean
but do I think you really need both
absolutely not I think it's kind of
overkill like I s I'm putting them on
today I thought this is kind of overkill
but I do like it so you kind of just got
to think what do I really want to try do
I want a primer more of a primer do I
want more of a serum with benefits just
depends um oh this does have a slight
smell but it's nice again it's not a
rosy smell so now here's a product you
guys have got to help me with this one
this is their Argan where argan oil with
coconut water so it's a primer it's a
spray primer I sprayed this on actually
first thing today
I mean it's suddenly a primer so tell
you put it on right before your
foundation you kind of do it however you
want so I just kind of sprayed it on to
get my skin going today it burns it
burns and it was made worse when I put
this on top of it and I'm like I don't
think it was this because I've been
using this for a while and I've never
felt it but this I haven't used as much
and today it just happened to burn and I
hadn't really noticed that before but I
don't know I I feel like it's not going
to be that thing that works as a primer
to hold your makeup on longer no I
really don't trust any spray to do that
because I'm like it's not ever even
perfectly evenly distributed first of
all and it's just not quite the same I
don't know I guess it can give a little
tackiness but this one I don't know I
just so far I'm not a really big fan I
know a lot of people like it so let me
know why why do you like it how do you
use it because I feel like I've used it
a couple different ways and it never
really performs the way I want it to and
again you know physicians forum is kind
of pricey so I don't want to recommend
this to you guys I really don't I guess
I don't really see the purpose in my
makeup routine does that make sense but
let me know if you love it how are you
using it one thing I am loving however
that you guys recommend it a lot of
these for recommendations for you guys
from you guys is
bright booster oil elixir if you've been
watching me a while you know I'm
especially in vlogmas when I would get
ready in a lot of those videos and talk
about what I'm using I've really gotten
into using like oils before actually
putting foundation and stuff on because
again with dry skin it's just an extra
step that adds a little bit more to your
skin but this is their bright booster uh
of course it doesn't say it says a
hundred percent natural origin but it
doesn't say anything about what's in it
of course not but from what I have heard
again I'm not a skincare guru I'm
certainly not a dermatologist so I'm
still kind of learning about skincare
skincare but I have heard that there are
a lot of really nice ingredients in this
especially for a drugstore serum so this
is something that I have really enjoyed
I can totally see myself using this up I
might even like this better like I've
got the Smashbox primer oil I think I
might like this better and I think this
has better ingredients but that is
totally one I would recommend if you've
never tried any kind of an oily type
thing in your routine I would totally
recommend this and I really really like
it alright something I did not like is
there this came as a duo and it's their
matte eye primer in their shimmer eye
primer and I thought that's also I love
that there's a matte one and a shimmer
one I'll probably want them out one most
of the time well I use the matte one
today I've been using it for a while it
is a squeezy two but really it's a doe
foot you know I mean I'm sure I could
totally squeeze it out of there but it's
just a very thin primer I think if you
have oily eyelids this is definitely not
gonna work it hardly works for me
genuinely I used it today but I used I
ended up using like a NYX white primer
just on the lid for the glitter portion
to stick to because I knew this wouldn't
be able to hold the glitter and this
isn't even like a separate glitter this
is like a cream glitter that usually
does okay but even still no so the
shimmer one is the same kind of
consistency it's not a lot of shimmer
which is fine you know I'm not when I'm
using a shimmer primer I don't need a
ton because I'm probably putting shimmer
on top of it you know but it's just it's
just so thin and I don't feel like these
hold onto shadow as well as like all
other drugstore eye primers and again
the price you can get way cheaper ones
that work way way better the ultimate
eye primer is amazing and cheaper and
what else the Milani eye primer is
amazing and cheaper they're just a
little bit thicker and for that they are
a little bit tacky err and they stay on
and they hold the shadow better so there
you go all right another product I love
I'll only talk about these briefly
because I know everyone talks about them
their brawn but er bronzer butter blush
these are lovely the blush I kept was
rosy pink I think they sent me these
blushes a while ago I think I'm on there
PR List which is funny because then I
just went out and bought a ton of these
on their website anyway but rosy pink is
the only one I ended up keeping only
because they were all really nice they
all had the same quality but I have so
many blushes I'm like okay I need to
like narrow this down I like this a lot
I was actually wearing it yesterday I'm
not wearing it today but it's just a
classic kind of blue toned pink very
pigmented smells really nice as long as
you like like kind of coconutty beachy
kind of sense if you don't you'll hate
it I'll tell you right now or if you're
sensitive to fragrance you probably
won't like it
very strong the butter bronzer they have
a couple shades I have the light bronzer
I think I might need to kind of amp it
up because I'm thinking it's just not
enough for me I like it because I can be
really sloppy with it and it still looks
nice like I cannot be sloppy with the
bronzer in this little trio are you
serious I was sloppy this morning
putting it on and I was like oh Jessica
you look crazy but with this because
it's a light I can be so sloppy and yet
it still gives me that lightly sunkissed
look but I don't even have to be careful
does that and I love that about a
product like I'm all about that because
I am NOT a makeup artist so I really do
like it but I do kind of want to try the
next shade up they might only have two
shades maybe three but this is the
lightest shade um the these things break
really easily like mine arty broke so it
doesn't actually shot Mike I know that
doesn't really matter but it kind of
totally matters you know anyway but
totally recommend those so the next
product is their kind of vintage
Physicians Formula quad it's their
classic nudes it's got two mats two
shimmer's I was pleasantly surprised I
really really was the shimmers are
definitely the standout part of this but
you definitely definitely with the
shimmers want to use a really good
primer the first time I use it I was
like uh because I used their primer and
it was garbage it was terrible but then
I used like literally any other primer
and it looked so so good you need
something good to hold these shimmers
down but they are stunning the mats are
pretty darn good as well I like that you
can totally do a look with these four
colors you know they really do go well
together
I think the icy white I don't use as
much with these kinds of shades but you
could use you know in the inner corner
but again I really like when quads
really are a complete look I like when
there's some matte and some shimmers so
you can genuinely like do a whole look
did I say that enough anyway so I really
did like this and oh the packaging is
pretty nice it clicks shut like with a
magnet and it wraps all the way around
why does that matter to me I don't know
but I really like that
okay a product I did not love so much
was their killer curves mascara this is
another newer launch it just gave me
like three lashes and they were kind of
curled and that was it and then it dried
and I couldn't even put another layer on
so do I think I'd hold a curl okay sure
but I only had like three lashes on each
side cuz it clump them together so badly
and it dried so quickly and I think the
reason it dries so quickly is so that it
can kind of hold that curl like if you
just curled your lashes and put it on it
sets really fast so that it holds that
which great except for again it clumps
your lashes together so I would pass on
this definitely not one I would
recommend alright next is their natural
nude highlighter it's their shimmer
strips and I love this this is the
highlight I'm wearing today on my
cheekbones I put a little bit on my nose
you can you know kind of get whatever
shades you want I usually kind of focus
on the top left corner up here but if
you're a little bit deeper skin tone you
can focus down there I'm just gonna
stroll down together it's so pretty it's
it's less about the colors of this and
more about the finish it's such a nice
thin formula so it just looks so
natural on your skin it kind of blends
right in I feel like days I wear this
I'll look in the mirror at the end of
the workday and be like that actually
looks really nice like it doesn't look
super fake and like any lighting I just
love this I love this for quite a long
time and I still love it if I ran out of
this or went back I would totally buy it
again because it's a definite staple in
my highlighter drawer next up is their
what do they call them youthful wear
powders I own the mat and the
illuminating one the illuminating I'm
definitely on the longest these powders
I consider powder foundations they have
really nice coverage I'm wearing the
illuminating one all over my face today
but I did set my nose with the matte one
these I mean they really do have nice
coverage here's the deal they say these
are translucent but they definitely are
catered more to someone my skin tone do
I think you could still put it on a
deeper skin tone and get a little bit of
an illuminating matte yeah but I think
there's still gonna be a little bit of a
cast so that's something to keep in mind
I do think the matte one has a little
bit more coverage than the illuminating
the illuminating I've heard some people
say oh my gosh there's shimmer all over
my face there's definitely little bits
of shimmer in it but not to the point
where for me it bothers me and you guys
know I don't like glitter on the face
and this doesn't bother me but if you
know any kind of a sheen does then
definitely go for the matte one
these are wonderful wonderful powders
definitely one that like I've traveled
with these these are powders that I
trust period I trust them they don't
look super cakey in you know direct
sunlight again there's still a powder so
they're not gonna look not like a powder
I mean to have that makes no sense but
it's it's the closest you can get in my
opinion especially with the illuminating
finish next are their butter
highlighters I have mixed feelings about
these I have all of them these they did
send to me at some point last year but
again they're still a newer launch I
think the packaging is super cool it's
kind of got that really pretty look to
it you know I don't know if that's
holographic or not but these are their
Muru Muru butter highlighters so this is
rose gold some of them are just way too
deep for me but they look gorgeous
deeper skin tones these are like a
creamy it's just really creamy but
they're so creamy that I find that I
can't get them to really stay put where
I want them so for example these darker
shades I thought well I can't wear them
as a highlighter but maybe I can wear
them on my eyes no they or comically
crazy they looked so pretty it was the
rose gold one the one I just watched
there I put that all over my lid and it
looked so pretty but like after about
three minutes with my best primer on it
was like crease city because it's just
not meant to be that way and it's so so
creamy so I thought okay well the one
shade that I could pull off as a true
highlighter is the one in Pearl now it's
like pure white which I'm like mm-hmm
it just doesn't it's just okay like
again it's not crazy pigmented I mean
they are but like once you blend them in
they're not you know what I mean it
looks okay but I feel like there's a lot
of stuff like this at the drugstore now
if you know this is the last shade just
so you can see it pink if you know this
is totally up your alley then go for it
girlfriend but it just really wasn't up
my alley and I actually really do like
cream and liquid highlighters a lot I
like to just tap them in those areas but
these didn't look as nice and as natural
as I wanted them to if you like ones
where it's like super obvious that
you're wearing a highlighter then I
think you'll like them I don't know how
else to describe it I just felt
underwhelmed I never want to reach for
these I keep forcing myself to use them
and I just don't enjoy using them and I
do feel like they kind of wear off again
I'm talking about really the white one
in that area I felt like it kind of wore
off after a few hours I'm like why did I
even take the time to put it on so
that's it that's my best and worst of
