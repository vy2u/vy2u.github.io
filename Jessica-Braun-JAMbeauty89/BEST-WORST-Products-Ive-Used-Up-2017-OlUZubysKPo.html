my empties video for you if you've never
seen one of these videos this is where I
show you products I've used up it's all
my trash most of it actually I can
recycle which is nice but I like to save
it because I like to show it to you guys
because then I can tell you my real
thoughts on this stuff because I really
I pretty much used it up so I've been
using it a while so what's going to get
into it so the first thing in here is
from uLTA Beauty I got it during the
holidays it's their marshmallows lost
three in one smoothie I did a whole
video on different things you could get
there for the holidays that were cute
gift ideas but I bought this for myself
and I loved it because it reminded me of
the Noah be Noelle and it was really
funny I ended up using it less as a body
wash and more just for bubble bath so I
would just pump a bunch into a bowl add
a little bit more less I'll probably
still try and use up but I liked it it's
kind of pricey for what it was and he
was like $12.99 or need even more and I
I don't know looking back on like I
don't know that it was worth it but it
was it smells really good a great bubble
bath next thing I used up I love this
this is the pure ology fresh approach
approach dry conditioner so this if you
don't know about that
try shampoo you know you put me or your
roots and I use that every other day but
when I put your I tinsel in my hair and
if you've ever used it you probably have
a similar experience you know once you
let it sit and kind of rub it in you'll
eventually kind of brush through it so
that it kind of gets rid of any
Whitecaps
well the ends of your hair end up
looking really dry and gross so dry
conditioner is for those ends so I'll
usually just take the end of my hair and
just spray it and then do it up kind of
you know from the other angle as well
and just run my fingers through it and
all of a sudden that part of my hair is
it smells nice it's revived and it's not
like super oily it's just this really
nice conditioning spray I don't know how
and it's not wet either so your hair
doesn't look wet at all it is the
coolest thing I'm trying a different
brand right now I think it's like a mica
or something and I really like that as
well but I loved this one the pure ology
ones so I probably I probably will
eventually repurchase this because I
liked the smell of it too and it lasts
me forever
you guys might judge me but I'm
literally eating lunch meat right now
because we need to go grocery shopping
so badly and I'm so hungry next thing I
used up was from
Niq it's their pep start quick cleansing
wipes escapement 50 and they did say
stay moist all the way to the end which
really surprised me because I didn't use
these every day I used them over the
course of a couple months just to wipe
off swatches so I don't use cleansing
wipes on my face just because I just
don't really like it I don't know I just
don't it's not that I never will or
never have I just currently it's not a
part of my recommend so I use these for
wiping off losses they did pretty well I
think you know some makeup wouldn't come
off easily regardless of the white so
they were nice if you've got like some
kind of coupon or like a gift card for
Clinique I don't know it might be worth
looking into but they didn't really like
blow my mind or anything like that so
good why can't it be good for you okay a
product I thought I liked and then I
hated so I didn't even use all the way
up this is a pixie glow tonic it started
to make my skin feel like it was burning
it could just be that it has a glycolic
acid in it I don't know how my skin
reacts to that I've never really had
like huge flare-up but it did make it
feel like it was burning so I stopped
using it this is just a trial so I don't
remember how where I got this probably
probably a subscription box but it I do
feel like it did make my skin look just
nicer a little less read a little more
kind of even but it wasn't worth the
burning sensation I know not everyone
has that reaction to it but I also know
some people have had really bad
reactions so I think it really depends
on your skin so for me it just did not
work out next thing again just is almost
used up it's been in my bathroom I'll
probably use it up over the next day or
two but I figure going to share it this
suspends me a long time ago by and light
this is their flawless body skin like
butt up super hydrating body butter eye
they sent me a bunch of stuff and I've
only used some of it and it's kind of
hair mist like I think they sent like a
scrub or something and I liked that I
really like this but it was a very weird
body butter I never tried one like this
because it's very like seemingly thick
but then when you put it on it blends
away and Melvyn your skin like instantly
it is the coolest thing so at first when
I tried it I did not like it but as I
tried it a little bit more I'm like
actually I
like it because in the winter and I'm
you know I'm wanting to put clothes on
it's cold when you get out of the shower
I was with this on as quick as I can and
then move on
so this melds into your skin instantly
do I think I'll buy it again
Callie not just because there's so many
body butters out there and I feel like
I've got a million on backup so it was
nice if you're looking for something
really moisturizing and sinks and
quickly you'd like it it does have a
strong sense of hmm it's kind of like a
clean semi-sweet kind of floral scent I
don't I'm not good at describing sense
oh it says caffeine mangosteen extract
and blackberry extract but I liked it oh
my gosh this is just going in the trash
well I might not been out in recycle it
this is the elf micellar cleansing water
this stuff rekt my skin I mean I was
talking about like how this kind of made
my skin burn I had a rash on my channel
I don't know what caused it but this
made it even worse and when I use this
on my eyes to take off my makeup like I
do with all kinds of micellar waters
never have an issue my eyes burn for
like five minutes I couldn't like I was
splashing water I couldn't stop the
burning I hated it so I did see I hope
members on Twitter or something where
they just said they might have
reformulated it like they heard our
cries so I assume this is the old bit
was very recently sent to me from the
company so I don't know but you guys
know I'm always honest with you guys and
I hated it so much glad to get rid of it
oh I love this stuff this is the Jergens
BB body
perfecting skin cream stuff it's so
weird because when I first heard about
it I was like what like it's kind of
this kind of brown tone kind of like it
really is out kind of like this beige
tone to it and you know I've heard like
oh it's like makeup for your skin well
it's not like natural glow and it's not
like a pan or by any means but when you
put it on especially your legs and like
your arms in the summer I don't use it
the winter I just don't need it you know
I'm not showing enough skin to worry
about it
but in that summer time I love having
this on hand so I'm gonna wait a few
months and then repurchase it because
it's kind of pricey for like a Jurgen
but it just makes your skin look glowy
and it kind of even things out just
slightly just enough that I feel so much
more confident in shorts this stuff is
amazing and it smells amazing as well if
you haven't tried it and you have like
minor imperfections that you're kind of
self-conscious about you will love this
stuff next thing is this vino gentle
scent lotion it's their skin relief and
nourishing coconut I posted about this
on Instagram I actually did a campaign
with them quite a while ago but so I
used this up recently and I really do
like this this is such a nice light
lotion for if you've got sensitive skin
I like it's got a really light scent I
really liked using it I probably will
repurchase it I like it more in like the
summer months just because it's really
light quick to apply you know and I
don't have super dry skin in the summer
so I don't feel like I need you know
something like a body butter so it's
just a really nice lotion next thing I
kind of used up is this L'Oreal bright
reveal brightening peel pads I think
this has doesn't have the info on it but
I have I think this has glycolic acid in
it as well they all kind of there's
still a little liquid in them but the
idea is it's kind of like a pre soaked I
think kind of like a toner pad or an
exfoliator you know kind of a-- in
between you wipe it all over your face I
just didn't like it I know some people
like these they send this to me a very
very long time ago and I don't know it
just kind of I felt like it didn't
really do much for my skin I didn't see
a really big difference and it was just
an extra step and as they started to dry
out I was like hmm I'm just kind of done
with them it's just kind of mess next
product is the Garnier Fructis texture
tease I've been looking for a drugstore
texturizing spray because for example
this is my Rusk texturizing dry
finishing spray and I also love the
Oribe look crazy expensive one I have it
and I'm babying it because it's like I'm
not even joking you guys like $40 so I
literally only use it when it's like a
special occasion of going out like it's
ridiculous so this is the closest thing
I found to it so far at the drugstore
where it's not necessarily a hairspray
but it almost acts like a dry shampoo in
a way where it just adds texture to your
hair without being white or anything
like that the thing I didn't like about
this is the smell is so strong and I
don't love this
well I just don't love it and it's
really strong
so Sam actually went for the Rusk one I
didn't think it was worth the price tag
is it still kind of more expensive if
you're going to spend this much you
might as well save up and buy the Oribe
one because this one the smell was very
overpowering I didn't like it I actually
have a little bit less than this like
this much but the nozzle broke and I've
tried twisting it and I'm like forget it
it's not worth it but I would pick the
gardenia one over this one and so will I
buy this again probably but if you guys
already know because I know texturizing
spray
sprays are on the rise and a lot of
people are making them now so if you
know of a different drugstore brand that
makes something like this let me know
because I want to try some other ones
but I did like it next thing I used up
is by knux or nooks tell them how to say
it it's their creme fraiche de beauté a
serum and this was in like this glass
jar I really liked it it's a very I had
a little bit less I can show you I've
had it long enough so it's almost gone
and I think it's gone bad but it's just
this serum you know you just kind of rub
it into your skin it definitely has a
strong and scent and I don't love that
my skin pear because I feel like you
know sometimes fragrance can be
irritants for your skin and while I just
didn't irritate my skin at all even so
unless you know it doesn't need that
sense I would rather just be totally
unscented you know whatever but I did
like it
this is on HauteLook a lot so if you're
interested in trying a serum it just
kind of moisturize my skin more than a
lot of other serums do and it just it
just kind of calmed my skin so I did
like it for that next product I used up
is by Kota Lee this is their micellar
cleansing water this was nice it's made
with great water and chamomile so again
it's very soothing on my face when I
would I would just squirt it onto a
cotton pad I would usually use that on
my makeup and then use one other ones
for my face makeup I liked it do I think
it's worth the hefty price tag probably
not just because like there's the
Garnier micellar water if it's safe to
use where you live so much silly
controversy around it and I don't know
what to believe so right now I'm not
using it usually get the Bioderma for a
little bit cheaper as well than this but
this was nice but again I don't think
I'll repurchase it just because the
price test also used up this
mom's luminous white toothpaste I
actually liked it and I've used a lot of
more natural toothpaste and I hated them
but this one I actually really liked and
I just stopped using I feel like my
teeth look pretty white I don't think
they look their widest like when I use
crest 3d white which I've just switched
back to my skin looks skin my teeth look
way whiter than when I use this but
they're still white but I drink tea and
coffee every day so I mean I've got to
be like actively working towards that or
else my fees would look crazy but it
does have fluoride in it it's natural
it's safe for enamel and I do have a
little bit weaker of enamel so I try not
to use the crest 3d white all the time I
like to kind of switch it up anyway I
liked it if you're into that or you want
a whitening natural one I think you'd
like it
this is a random thing I used up but I'm
thinking about buying the full size
although it might all be in my head this
is the this works deep sleep pillow
spray and you spray this there's a
little bit left you spray it on your
pillow and it smells like lavender and
what else does it stand on here I
doesn't have it all on here but it just
smells so nice and you gotta let your
pillow dry for a second I don't know if
it actually works to calm you down but
you know like if you think it's like
essential oils and stuff and how that
stuff can work I really like the smell
of it even my husband is do you think
we'd spray both of our pillows at night
we felt like we slept really well again
it could be in our hand but I liked it
so I'm thinking about I think it is kind
of pricey and I'm like ah but I really
liked this stuff used up the Dollar Tree
pure eyes eye eyedrops I love this stuff
it's a dollar and it's so great because
it's not as strong as like these roto
eyedrops
are really really strong and I have
naturally red eyes and I feel like yes
they get rid of the redness but they
almost like dry my eyes out whereas this
is really moisturizing but it gets rid
of all redness in my eyes so I buy when
I go to the Dollar Tree I usually buy
like three of these I have one at work
I've just got the worst red eyes but I
used it today and my eyes are really
white right so I love this southern I
have one used up
I've probably gotten too used up but
anyway this other one okay I told you
guys how much I love the Oprah liquid
lipsticks well this one got really weird
like I don't know what happened it's
like the oil separated but it's not as
like pigmented as the other ones are and
it was originally it's the weirdest
thing so I'm just going to get rid of it
I like the shade though it's mocha but
the other ones the full-size ones
haven't done that to me but this one did
and I just thought that was weird and
maybe worth mentioning okay this is
crazy
I only have three of these in here but
I've used like 15 these are my sheet
masks that I've been using I'm going to
just mention the three I have I wish I
would have saved all of them but the elf
hydrating water sheet mask blew my mind
I I wasn't I have a bunch of sheet masks
and I was kind of putting off using this
because I was like is it even gonna work
like I don't know like I'm like I it's
the same way we all feel about Alf like
how about the products Mike oh my gosh
it's so amazing and then the other half
I'm like there it is okay this said my
face and Mike was actually well made it
wasn't just a like cheapo like a tri-d
um yes to coconuts one and I am so liked
it but I felt like the mask was really
cheap this one did not feel cheap I
don't know what in the world that was
made out of but it was so it felt like a
high-end mask so I am you to buy a
couple more of these I was so blown away
by how nice it was um this one I got a
bunch of these skin Sue's ones these are
really nice this was the one in orange
there was like a blueberry one a tomato
one of yous I think almost all of them I
didn't really notice the difference
between any of them other than just the
smell they were pretty good
I mean she masks are tricky unless you
have like an unbelievable experience
with one you kind of feel like they all
do similar things but I do like using
them because I do feel like with any of
them my skin really does was noticeably
more even ready to apply makeup or
sometimes I'll do them before bed just
if I feel like my skin needs that extra
bit of moisture but I just love sheet
masks I never thought I would see today
but I really do love them my favorite
sheet mask ever and these are so
expensive that I'm so sorry guys
it is the urna lászló hydrogel mask
this I have three of them this is the
only one I've used so far because I'm
babying these it's this hydrogel mask
where it's literally made of
well it's not like a cotton mask or a
paper literally made of this expensive
apparently gel and it's in two pieces so
it fits your face it doesn't move I like
to wear these and like work out while
I'm wearing it and if it's a cheaper one
I just can't because it'll the thing
will flop all open but this stays put I
was even doing push-ups and it was
staying where it was unbelievable
experience I didn't want to take it off
I wanted to save it but it would be
toxifying and I really do feel like my
skin looks so amazing for like the next
few days after using this I want a
million of these but they're so
expensive
but yeah this stuff was amazing they
have a couple of kinds as a pink one and
a blue and I have this one's detoxifying
I don't remember what the other ones are
but if you have the money to splurge or
you're wanting to really treat someone
to something nice this would be an
amazing gift or a gift for yourself
treat you'll sue treat stuff mm sad
teeth you know that shelf do you guys
know that show I say it all the time so
those were all of my empties that I know
of right now other than what I forgot to
save and that I threw away I hope this
is gone if you like watching these I
will link my empties playlist where I
talk about a bunch of other best and
worse there really weren't me makeup
products that I've used up that's no
surprise because it takes me a long time
to use a makeup I hope that before you
leave you'll subscribe and catch more of
my videos and I hope you'll also check
me out on my social media right up there
and other than that I will catch you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
