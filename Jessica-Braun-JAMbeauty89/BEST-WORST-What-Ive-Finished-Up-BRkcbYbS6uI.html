gonna share with you guys what is in my
trash can here which is full of beauty
products I have a lot of makeup this
time around usually I don't run through
makeup but boy I've gone through quite a
bit lots of skin care hair care Lola
it's going to be in random order sorry
if you enjoy this kind of video
definitely subscribe I do a lot of high
end but I also do a lot of drugstore and
Duke type videos I will link my recent
empties videos if you're curious about
seeing more of this style otherwise
let's go to get into it alright first
thing my Brazilian boom boom cream you
guys told me I was saying it wrong from
Sol de Janeiro oh my gosh this stuff
smells amazing it makes my skin I
actually have a little bit left but I
knew would be gone by the time but it's
a super not thick though it's like thick
and moisturizing but it's not so thick
like there are some body butters I've
tried they're like so thick that you're
like I can't even blend it in but this
one blends in so beautifully it makes
your skin I don't want to say it looks
glowy because it's not like a natural
glow kind of a product I'll talk about
some of those but it just makes your
skin look healthy and super moisturized
if you've ever had you know like it's
summer and you're like okay I'm gonna
have my legs out my legs look janky
that's how I always feel like my legs
look so janky but like I put this on and
I instantly have just that little bit
more confidence because I know they look
really moisturizing really healthy at
least in that respect they also have
claims to help with like so you like
kind of stuff like firming I haven't
noticed a ton of that but I do just love
the way it makes my legs look anyway so
for that reason alone I love it and
there but I layer it next up speaking of
like firming I have a couple products I
had the Gherkin skin firming does it
firm your skin no not at all I had seen
a certain youtuber talking about it and
they were swearing by this like yeah and
then they were like oh and I'm going to
a Jergens event tonight and I was like
and I had okay the story is I'm this
sucker I'm the sucker because I saw snap
from this youtuber and she was like this
jerk and skin firming stuff is amazing I
swear by it it totally gets rid of
cellulite totally firms I wear it all
the time in life it works
it's drugstore so I literally went out
to the store like an hour after seeing
it and bought this stuff and I'm bought
other stuff and no it does not work but
I like later that night I saw in the
same youtuber snaps that she had gone to
a Jergens event that night I'm like oh
interesting but is it a bad lotion no
does it firm no now if it did it helped
in a miniscule way I don't know I really
didn't notice and boy let me tell you
I'm checking all the time so I don't I
don't think so
if anything I think that boom boom cream
worked better than this of course this
is way more expensive but none of these
are miracle workers um so anyway I also
have the Jergens natural glow
it's the plus firming I don't even know
if they sell this anymore I was looking
for it the other day I think this works
a little bit really it's probably just
the fact that I'm adding a little bit of
color and life to my legs that's
probably it's making him look better
than the actual firming part of it if
that makes sense but I really did like
it I was looking for it again I did buy
a new natural glow I always get the
darker like the medium to tan cuz this
is not if you've never tried this this
is not a self tanner it's not something
that you're gonna put on and be streaky
and be like oh no it looks crazy no it
really is just a lotion that adds a tiny
bit of color it has never ever look
streaky no matter how I apply I mean you
apply it like a normal lotion you don't
have to worry about it but it does add a
little bit of color especially if you do
it every single day but it's nothing to
be scared of and that's why I like it
next is something that I liked it was
the L'Oreal extraordinary clay line and
it's dripping I knew that would happen
and I brought it from the shower anyway
Jessica you were asking for it anyway um
the idea behind this is that it kind of
rebalances your hair and it kind of
cleans out your roots if you've got
Whaley roots which I totally do and yet
it also moisturizes that's hard for a
shampoo and conditioner to do both I
will say that but I do feel like when I
use this my hair did not get as oily as
quickly will I buy it again probably not
actually I think they might have sent
this to me
but would I go out and buy it probably
I liked it but I didn't think it was a
miracle worker and I didn't love the
smell of and it wasn't bad but it was
just one that I was like I don't really
like this so yeah it does have a
particular smell so for that reason I'm
not gonna buy it again
next up the simple cleansing facial
wipes I don't use the wipes on my face I
just don't know I don't have anything
against it I just don't but these I use
for swatches they did pretty well I mean
I don't think it's something that you
need to run out and get but if you like
them on your face I have heard a lot of
people really really like these because
they're a little more gentle but I felt
like they got off makeup swatches pretty
darn well too so that's pretty good
next up when I wear my hair naturally
like wavy curly it's more wavy than
curly um I always use this so I have
like maybe one more use in it so I'm
probably gonna put it in my bathroom and
use that and then it'll be gone but it's
the Rusk wired flexible styling cream
what I always do and I can link the
video where I've shown myself doing it
but and I was using different products
but I think this really is my favorite
now that I've tried it anyway you put it
in your hair and like just kind of
scrunch it into it and then I'll usually
throw a mousse in it as well hairspray
it and then blow-dry it with the
diffuser and it really this really holds
the curls or the waves together and I
love it next up oh my gosh so talking
about perfected legs this is the perfect
10 it spelled different than normal it's
PE RF e Katie but it's their liquid gold
this stuff is like famous with
celebrities apparently cuz I looked it
up and I was like what so you can use it
alone and it's literally there's a
little tiny bit left I'm gonna use but
it's literally like a golden colored
lotion and you put it on your I usually
put it on my legs and it's basically
like makeup for your legs and I know
that sounds like a lot of work because
that's kind of how I felt I'm like okay
no because that's gonna get on
everything does it transfer yes it does
so be careful like I wore white sandals
and it got out like you know I could
wipe it off but it did get a little on
that but it makes your legs look
gorgeous
I'm
talking perfect I'm totally I'm totally
convinced that this would be what
celebrities would use maybe on their
legs and arms for award shows things
like that I am totally in the market to
buy another one of these it is
incredible it's shimmery make sure legs
look bronzy without actually using a
self-tanner washes right out in the
shower so it's not like something that
you can you need to worry about I've
even taken this since I was running low
I've taken it and I've mixed it like
with the boom-boom cream or any kind of
a lotion and it still is a really pretty
lotion but it's less likely to transfer
oh my gosh I love it so when you're when
if it's a special event or you're going
out at night on vacation you really want
that kind of bronze goddess look it's
amazing and so much easier to use than
you would think my favorite cleanser I'm
out of it's the serum a hydrating
cleanser I've talked this stuff to death
if you want a moisturizing cleanser this
is amazing it doesn't dry your skin out
it totally cleans your pore still it's
amazing I have gone through a many many
of these I already miss it I'm using the
glossy a1 which I like it's very similar
to this but I like this one better so
and this is way cheaper so highly
recommend it definitely my number one
favorite cleanser of all time drugstore
high end doesn't matter that one's my
favorite alright moving on this one I'm
just calling it I'm calling time of
death because it's the Marcell Hydra sea
energy oh sorry facial exfoliating gel I
had at my shower for a long time it's
got to be bad at this point I've
literally moved it from like one place
to the next the next so I'm like it is
definitely time it's got those little
beads in it that exfoliate and I don't
really like that on my skin I've heard
that it can cause micro tears and I've
noticed little bits on my skin and I'm
like you know if I don't know if it was
this but I want to avoid it at all costs
so it was just time it wasn't bad it has
kind of a fresh fresh is smell not
really kind of a fresh scent but it just
wasn't my favorite next this was a a hit
and a miss for me this is the pixie and
Caroline hurons double cleanse this is a
cool idea it has half it's a solid
cleansing oil like a cleansing
which is my favorite way to remove
makeup it's what I use every night and
then a cleansing cream so basically just
a cleanser the idea of this is genius
it's both side by side except for it's
not genius because you get crap in both
sides and the way that I use it so maybe
it's just me because of the way I clean
my face but this is just what I do I
would get the cleansing balm out and I
would have this open to my counter and I
would you put it on your dry face and
then you turn on water and you kind of
mix it in together and it gets all your
makeup off it's amazing my favorite way
to do it in the cleansing balm looks
great but then what I do with my face
still wet I'll go ahead and get usually
like it's in a squirt bottle
I'll get my cleanser my eyes are still
closed and then I just start cleaning my
face so I'm not drying my face and then
getting wet again I just kind of just do
both right one right after the other the
problem was I was getting like you know
a little bit of the residue from getting
the makeup off in the cleanser and I
just I didn't like that I had to dig my
fate hands in it first of all but second
of all I was getting just dirty water
everywhere and it's still gross and I
was like I was gonna keep it and try to
keep going and I'm like I can't it's so
gross to me so I wish and I hope that
pixie will come out with just that
cleansing balm in a thing like this
because that cleansing balm was amazing
it's totally probably better than like
the Clinique one that I have and this
would be cheaper the it cosmetics one I
love all those but those are expensive
and I loved this so I hope that they
will do like their own separate one of
that solid cleansing oil because it's
amazing I was really sad to say goodbye
to this one it's my Coco Chanel well
it's the Coco Mademoiselle I bought this
I want to say did I buy it when we were
in France I'll have to ask Tyler when it
was maybe I bought it when we were in
London we always buy a perfumer cologne
when we travel my husband is a travel
agent we travel a lot but when we travel
somewhere special we always buy a
perfume or cologne so we can remember
that trip and we wear it the whole trip
and then it always reminds us of course
apparently this one didn't remind me
enough of
because I couldn't member which country
but this is my favorite perfume ever it
is the best smelling perfume in my
opinion it's just my favorite I'm so sad
and I'm so glad to finally have a
perfume that's my favorite cuz I have
plenty that I've tried that I've liked a
lot this is the best one oh my gosh I
love it
alright um I used up the wet and wild
under the sheets actually there's one in
there but it dried up their little like
makeup removers they're actually
surprisingly good they really remove
makeup I don't know if I'd want to use
them on my face
although a lot of you guys have said you
have and they were just fine but the
reason I say that is cuz they're so good
at removing makeup that I'm like are
they like really harsh but a lot of you
guys have said you use them and they're
just fine but I found out the Dollar
Tree um next again this is a calling
time of death on it because I've had it
for too long
it's the yes to coconut ultra hydrating
facial mask
I loved this stuff I used probably half
of it it's a very hydrating kind of a
cream mask you just put on leave on for
a while and then you rinse off my
husband's use it - it smells amazing
like coconuts I really really liked it
was very very moisturizing it's one of
those things that I have so many masks
right now to work through but if I ever
ran out or I was just dying for that I
would totally go out and buy this again
it really is nice I would totally
recommend it next is my be nigma all on
face cream you guys know I've done video
with them before I love this stuff I
they gave me a coupon code a million
years ago when I first when I worked
with them if I still have it I'll put it
below if not I'll just find the link for
it I will tell you this right now the
website looks so cheesy like roll cheesy
like it looks like no there's no way
this this is an amazing face cream it
definitely has the smell of like kind of
honey and the it's manuka honey bee
venom and shea butter but that
combination of ingredients is the most
moisturizing luxurious thing but it's
really pricey that's why I was glad they
given coupon codes so I'll put it below
if you're interested super pricey so it
is like a luxury kind of a thing but I
loved it and I'm really
to be a fit would I buy it again I I
would and probably eventually will but
again I've got so many face creams to
wear here right now alright we're almost
to the makeup oh this was my husband's
empty it's from number seven it's their
early defense night cream he loved this
stuff he said he liked it felt
moisturize in heat or through it looks
like there's like a tiny glop left he
gets spoiled with sin skincare because I
do get sent a lot of stuff and I buy a
lot of stuff and so you know if I tried
something for a while and I'm like okay
I've got a feel for it but I don't love
it I'll let him have it and he'll
usually it's awesome but also I'll just
let him go into my skincare drawers and
pick out what he wants to use so this is
one of those things that I had actually
tried before him and I remember liking
it too it's a very lightweight cream for
a night cream but it did feel really
moisturizing but he really really liked
it and it it's kind of I think he liked
it too because it looked like manly
colors but next up is the glossy a super
bounce serum there's like a teensy tiny
bit I will say this it's half of an
ounce and I flew through it this oh it's
about to storm yes I love afternoon
storms I liked this it's a hyaluronic
serum so it's great to kind of hydrate
your skin make it a little bit of
anti-aging it's got vitamin b5 it's just
really pricey for what it is I already
have another one of these that I've
recently bought so I will use it again
but I really like there's a you can get
from the ordinary really cheap serums
they might not be as high-quality but
they've got a lot of the same
ingredients in them and they have a
hyaluronic acid serum that I would
recommend if you're wanting to save some
money because the ordinary is really
really inexpensive and these are really
pricey for what they are so yes I liked
it the packaging is cute I've done a
whole review on them I can link below
but I think it's too pricy for what it
is Oh someone's trying to cut the grass
before that storm Godspeed okay let's
keep going okay last skincare then it's
all makeup um it's I don't want to show
it to you it's really gross it's my
Clarisonic like little Mia it's the pink
one that's like this big it's not got a
handle it's like you just hold in your
hand I love it I use it so much more
than the one I have to why I have to I
have no idea things happen
I have the one with the handle but I
like the one that's like you just hold
in your palm and you do but I'm using
another one this one I accidentally got
like lipstick on and I can't get it off
also it was just time for me to replace
the head so I'm not going to show you a
close-up either because it's really
gross but I'll link the Clarisonic that
I'm talking about down below if you're
curious it's one of those things that
it's pricey
I do love I don't do it every day it's
safe to use every day but I do it like
every other day when I feel like I've
worn a lot of makeup from like I really
want to get it out of my pores I think
it does a great job at that but if it's
a day that I just want some BB cream or
something
I don't always do it but it really is
good and I really like the specific one
I have so it's expensive and I think
that it's one of those things you might
want to like ask for for Christmas or
you know use gift cards on because it is
pricey but it's a worthwhile investment
alright I'm just gonna pull it all out
so my makeup empty if I can reach it
okay so while this one's nail polish but
it's the formula X shine XL topcoat it's
just gotten goopy I love this stuff
formula X discontinued and I'm really
sad because the primer and the shine
were the best I've ever tried ever it is
what it is but it was amazing I would
recommend if you're in the market for a
topcoat the while such V is always a
classic that's what I've been using
lately I haven't painted my nails in a
long time giving them a break as I do a
lot anyway but this was amazing next was
this pure cosmetic sponge that was the
worst thing I've ever tried I know
apparently they changed what it what it
is basically and it's no good it used to
be supposedly really good it was
terrible it came in a box to charm a
pack of three and it's absolute garbage
so I didn't want to forget to mention it
they're terrible they're way too dense
you feel like you're punching yourself
no matter how what you get it it doesn't
change it's really bad
try the Real Techniques orange ones
those are amazing and they're really
really cheap Oh or the L'Oreal
infallible one or the purple flower
Beauty one they are all amazing I have a
couple of mascaras I have my essence
lash princess I swear I fly through
these it is totally a dupe for another
empty my it
superhero I feel like every empties
video I have like these empty but it's
just kind of dried out it's just time
but it's a really good volumizing
curling mascara one of my absolute
favorites it cosmetics superhero also my
like Holy Grail it's just so dried up
you can barely open it and it was
getting flaky and stuff but these are
totally dupes for each other the brushes
are pretty much the same and they're
just they're really good mascaras but
this one is like three or four dollars
this one's like 20 so totally go for the
lash princess over this but I would say
this mascara is for you if you like like
really volume eyes thick lashes I love
these the next mascara is from Clarins
it's their Supra volume this was just a
nice like everyday mascara like it it
definitely separated my lashes and added
a little bit of volume but it was
nothing to write home about and it was
really pricey I got mine for free
through octa Lee and I love octel a
because they want you to be super honest
I mean you'd hope that every company
would want you to be honest but I will
definitely say there are shady companies
out there that you know they would
rather you just not talk about their
product of course anyway bhakta lee is
great because you can get free stuff on
there and review it and they want you to
give your honest feedback so anyway it
was good don't buy it it's really
expensive it's not worth the money next
is my Stila stay all day liquid liner
it's waterproof it's amazing but you
guys I finally found a drum server
version that's better
and of course way cheaper this is an
amazing one it's a felt-tip but it's
like 18 or 20 bucks the NYX epic ink
liner is incredible better than this
stays on its oh my gosh I've literally I
have one I've already bought a backup
and I think I bought another one cuz I'm
like if anything happened and they
discontinued it I would be so sad I
don't think they will um oh I've got
mascara everywhere
pause freeze everyone freeze nobody move
there was mascara if you saw on the
close-up like on the actual it cosmetics
thing it gets really gross when it gets
old anyway okay crisis averted so I
loved this stuff with the NYX that was
better so I own like both below but the
next one is way
better and it's so cheaper so much
cheaper next is the bite Beauty agave
lip mask I didn't like this stuff for a
while I thought I did but I think it was
one of those things that was like
wanting myself to like it because I'm
like I kind of liked the packaging it's
very like matte like I love like metal
II too kind of packaging I don't know
what's wrong with me I just do but it
was very thick and not comfortable cuz
it was like sticky and thick and I never
felt like my lips were that moisturize
after having it on so for those reasons
and I think this is like not even the
full size thank goodness I think it came
with like something else I just didn't
like it and so if you've got it on like
your wish list cuz you're like oh I
really like it and some people I'm
telling you I don't think anyone will
like it and I feel like I've heard a lot
of other people say the same thing like
they thought they liked it and then as
they really try it more they're like you
know what I don't like this stuff it's
just not that great and it's super
expensive and if you're wanting a true
lip mask
I love the Lin edge lip sleeping mask oh
my gosh it's amazing it's pricey but you
get a ton and it's actually like a lip
mask you leave on overnight you put it
on like a thick lip balm but it's like
creamy and it smells amazing and it's
pink and so you look like normal you're
not putting on like a weird huge like
white mask anyway but you put that on
and you sleep with it in your lips are
like a baby's bottom in the morning it's
amazing so the next makeup item is from
everyday minerals and it's their
multitasking mineral concealer I bought
this on like Vitacost you can get it at
health food stores places like that it
was a really brightening amazing
concealer I just had it for way too long
and it's definitely gone bad well I
don't know for sure but I'm like yeah it
kind of has a little bit of an off smell
so I was like it's time I don't I don't
I'm not desperate to have it because it
was really good but I've got plenty of
things like this it was kind of pricey
for what it was so like looking back I
feel like the elf HD loose powder is
really good if you're looking for
something brightening but it's not going
to break the bank so yeah so those were
all of my empties it's totally and
if you enjoy the style of video
definitely give it a thumbs up if you
want to catch more of my drugstore
reviews and other videos like that I
hope you'll subscribe and stick around
