going to share with you empties that I
finished up I love filming these videos
because then I can take this big old
trash can full of stuff sort it into
recycling trash whatever and it's empty
for a while until I finish more products
so I always try to go around if there's
anything that I'm almost finished
I like to pull into here as well because
I figure by the time it fills up again
it'll have been months ago bla bla
doesn't um so let's start with I don't
even know where to start these will be
mixed up and this will probably be a
long video brace yourself so first thing
I finished a L'Oreal lash paradise
mascara I go through these like freaking
every other month I do want to try with
this one though because this I literally
just took out today just I was like I
think it's done some of you guys have
told me to put contact solution and then
a more of you have told me to put it in
hot water like a mug of hot water
because it kind of loosens and softens
the product inside and that way it
doesn't mess with the formula as much
but it definitely adds to the time you
can use it maybe even by a few weeks so
I might still hold this out and try that
just cuz I'm so curious but I love this
I keep repurchasing it this is probably
the fourth one I've had very volumizing
I'm wearing it today kind of but I mixed
it with something else just because it
was on its last leg but this one
probably it's like one use left this is
the Sunday Riley good jeans lactic acid
treatment I'm like sad to see this go it
is so good it completely transformed my
skin when I started using this quite a
while ago this was like a sample size
and it was still expensive oh my gosh
I've realized that it really is worth
the price so this is one of those things
I have on my Sephora love's list and I'm
probably eventually gonna buy because
I'm like I get I see it I see why it's
worth the price now a lot of you guys
have asked about the lactic acid
treatment from the ordinary here's what
I have learned from different
dermatologists i watch on youtube that
the ordinary is fantastic there are a
lot of good products for really really
cheap but with some of them you're not
quite getting exactly what you get from
another brand so for example a lot of
like the Ordinaries products are not
manufactured but
kind of harvested in a way that you know
the the ingredients aren't necessarily
as effective as they might be if they
had been cold-pressed or if they had
been unrefined like maybe you would see
in drunk elephant products or in Sunday
Riley products so it's just something to
keep in mind I have been trying to
lactic acid from the ordinary as well
because it's so much cheaper like under
ten dollars cheaper and this you know
these are like hundred dollars depending
on the size you get this works better
for my skin it just does and they're not
the exact same ingredients because they
have they're completely different
consistencies so they have other
ingredients in them beyond just lactic
acid but I really I noticed a bigger
difference with this I wish I could tell
you the opposite trust me next thing boy
this has like this much left this thing
has lasted me forever
it's the equation gentle boys rising
cleanser this is very very similar to my
favorite Holy Grail cleanser from the
drugstore the serum a hydrating cleanser
that is my favorite I literally had
bought it back up and I gave it to my
little niece because she's starting
she's growing up but she's starting to
break out and I'm like oh my gosh
so my sisters like do you have anything
she could use like oh yeah so I gave her
that I don't I haven't asked her like if
it's working or not but um so I need to
get another backup of that to replace
after this cuz I freaking love that
stuff but um this is really really nice
now I think that this year babe I don't
know which is cheaper but they're
probably right around the same price
same size bottle ish and uh it's just a
gentle but hydrating cleanser it doesn't
strip your skin I double cleanse always
I always use like a makeup balm you know
removing balm and then I use my cleanser
so I'm not only depending on this I
think if you were depending on this just
for a removing makeup as well I don't
know that it would do as well as you
want it to
oh let's talk about something I hated I
feel bad this was sent to me but you
guys know I'm always honest I couldn't
even finish this neither could Tyler he
okay so the brand is amino Mason what an
adorable jar I had the this is the
shampoo we had the conditioner as well
but I was like I don't need to keep both
you know we recycled one but it's there
whipped cream champ
and it has manuka honey cherimoya
avocado I'm like oh my gosh that sounds
so amazing the bottle is so freakin cute
it was so cute in our shower well we
were both using it and as I used it you
know I've got wavy ash curly ash hair
and I'm like dude anything that dries
out my hair is like no-go like I can't
do it Garnier Fructis often times will
dry out my hair
Herbal Essences will dry up my hair
depending on the line so my hair I'm
it's my hair it's vinicky because it has
to be because if I'm gonna get it to
look anything like this I need to have
something moisturizing going in there
both the shampoo and the conditioner
anyway so this just dried it out it
likes so badly that my hair is more
tingly than normal and what is going on
and I thought I was crazy I'm like while
I am pregnant like maybe it's but then I
would go back to other shampoos and
conditioners it was just fine and
Tyler's got saying some things like yeah
I don't really love this it smells
really really nice but I just we neither
one of us could agree or could get along
with this formula both the shampoo and
conditioner which I was sad because
again it's so cute but big ol Paz big
old past okay so this is from Kota Lee
it's their premier cru eye cream this
stuff is crazy expensive now again I
have just a little bit left I'm gonna
use that before I actually get rid of it
but I just don't feel like I feel like
it's nice but I'm not noticing anything
life-changing and this is really really
expensive you almost feel like if you're
spending that much money on skincare
especially an eye cream that it better
freaking be working wonders and I do I
don't feel like it is like I prefer my
Kiehl's midnight recovery eye cream is
that what it's called over this and I
think this is more expensive so just
something to keep in mind it's not bad
it's moisturizing do I think it's doing
anything beyond just moisturizing no I
really don't I just don't so my favorite
hairspray yet again I probably would
have liked to in here but I I figure
keeping one is just enough but for this
but it's the Bed Head masterpiece
hairspray this is always on sale Ulta I
just bought a couple more on backup
I've loved this for years it smells
amazing I used it today it holds your
hair just enough where it's still
Chabal but it definitely is holding it
together if that makes sense so I'll use
it when my hair is natural like this
I'll use it when my hair is maybe a
little more blow-dried and styled
it works in every way it smells so good
so right now like I saw an Ulta I don't
know if it will be when you're seeing
this but it was like 2 for 24 the Tiki
brand which is what this is or TG tigr
it's amazing you've got to try at least
once but don't buy it full price
cuz it's almost always on sale so look
online don't buy it full price cuz the
full price is like 23 bucks speaking of
expensive freaking hair products I was
actually really sad to finish this up
this is the Oribe dry texturising spray
smells really good you guys this is like
a freaking I think there might be a it's
like a freaking windstorm for your hair
it's the freshest nicest smell one of my
favorite smells and hair product I've
ever tried my hair always smells so
fresh and clean but not in a like fake
way it just smells like I just shampooed
my hair so I love the smell this this
bottle is like 40 something dollars and
I actually bought this I can't believe I
did but it was so good I like babied
this bottle because again similarly to
this it just adds this texture that's
like touchable it's not hard it'll
refresh your hair even though it's not
necessarily a dry shampoo so I would dry
shampoo just a little bit up here
and then I would spray this throughout
and kind of like flip my head upside
down kind of judge it around flip my
hair back and it would look gorgeous
like supermodel perfect I'm like what
the heck is this stuff this stuff is
crazy so I would love to buy it again
one day
I might buy it again one day but I feel
like I've got so many haircare products
that I would like to try before I
repurchase but I would totally purchase
pretty girl over here cocoa butter
it's the Palmer's cocoa butter formula
massage cream for stretch marks I flew
through this so I would use this in
addition to oils this would be like the
cream or moisturizer I'd put on top
right now I'm using a thicker raw shea
butter I'm kind of a cream if you will
but I really did like this would I buy
it again yes but again I've got all
these other products I bought I just
bought a couple cuz I was like well I
don't know what's gonna work
to prevent stress first a little to see
so I'm constantly kind of switching it
up and trying different things but I
really did like this a lot this I every
purchased time and time again this is
the Gillette Venus shower and shave
cream and vanilla cream I love the smell
this there's something about it that it
smells like something like from my
childhood and I can't pinpoint it smells
so good um it's vanilla II but there's
like a tartness to the smell I'm almost
like a sweet tart but it's just so
really moisturizing kind of lotion like
but it lathers just a little bit just
enough for you to quickly shave your
legs and I just like it I'm kind of away
from the like foam kinds of things in
the metal containers not only for any
reason other than it would wash off
anyway I'm like this is just a little
bit more moisturizing for my legs so
even when I'm done shaving it feels like
they're moisturize already and I really
really like that so I fly through these
bottles it's nice because I can always
tell that I actually used it up I think
I mean I might maybe be one more use
actually this one I bought now that I'm
thing but I know Gillette sent me some
recently and I want to say the one I'm
about to use next is probably when they
send me but it's the same thing that I
had already been flying for quite a
while now okay so this is the Dove
purely pampering nourishing body wash I
okay to try to not give too much
information here Tyler has to give me
progesterone hormone shots for our
little baby growing in there and he has
to do them twice a week and so they can
be really itchy like where he injects it
into me it can be really itchy for a
while I have like a rash and it might
have been from the carrier oil that the
hormone was in so I've switched from
this which I'd been using to a novena
one and the Aveeno one cleared it up
like that and I've not had any rashes
sense so I don't think that this was
causing it but I just don't think it was
helping it and so there's probably this
much left I might like see if Tyler
wants to use the last little bit we'll
see but it smells nice it's a coconut
milk with jasmine it really does have
more of a Jasmine scent than coconut but
I did like it and I actually want to say
that I bought this like in a three
packet Costco or Sam's Club somewhere
and I just
I haven't have to maybe what maybe when
I'm no longer pregnant I can switch back
to this cuz I did like it but I think
the Aveeno she's really my skin really
gets along well with it this is the
clear care hydrogen peroxide it's like a
deep cleanser for your contacts this
changed my life there are very specific
instructions you have to follow there's
a specific container I didn't even know
this existed and when we started using
it I was like suddenly I can put my
contacts in every single morning and
they're actually clean there's no
residue from makeup from the day before
I mean it cleans and you can see when
you put it down the container is very
weird totally different than normal
containers that's vertical and you fill
it up with liquid and you put them in a
little thing and you stick it in there
and twist it on I'm sure that made no
sense it I mean you see it bubbling and
they even say like not to put them in
your eyes after like like you have to
have them in there for at least six
hours or something like that
cleaning cuz if you like after two hours
of them being in there try to put them
in your eye well it's going to burn I
don't understand the science behind this
but I'm amazed they are so clean I feel
like my contacts are lasting just a
little bit longer because of this
because I think the ones we both have
our like monthly ones I've already ivory
purchased this like three times both of
us have the next product is from dis
Onge Paris it's their replenishment had
been sent to me in some PR package from
some PR firm like two years ago and I
finally got around to trying it I
thought this was a really expensive
product but then I saw it at CVS and it
was like maybe ten to fifteen dollars
like okay that's not crazy it's not
super cheap but I was thinking this
would be like a thirty forty dollar
product because it performs so well it
was so moisturizing and like I would
just squirt a little bit it's truly an
oil between my fingers and I would just
run it into my hair and I'd let it air
dry and it would look so nice and kind
of it would hold the ends together even
if you had some split ends and I just
really enjoyed it there's still a little
bit left again so I'll probably use it
up before I actually recycle it I really
I was really impressed with that next
are these skin Iceland glacial cleansing
cloths I feel like I have these in a lot
of empties i buy these on HauteLook when
they're on there cuz they're like 50%
off on there because it's I I think
they're kind of pricey otherwise but
it's thirty in a pack they stay super
wet the entire
way like down to the last cloth and I
don't use these to take off makeup off
my face I use them for swatches things
like that but I really like these
because they like suds up and it might
freak you out the first time you use it
but they like literally like you start
wiping in it like suds up it's so cool
but I I'm a really big fan of these I
think I'm out of this brand and the next
time it's on HauteLook I'm going to
check it out I can Lake Holt look below
if you're interested another product toy
and I we're both using is the Paul
Mitchell shampoo 2tw oh it's a deep
cleansing kind of clarifying shampoo so
we didn't buy like the coordinating
conditioner we just bought this probably
at Target or somewhere but it definitely
got rid of all the grime in our hair we
both use it maybe once a week maybe once
every other week but it would do such a
good job of just getting rid of that
grime I'm now using however a Brio go1
that is unbelievable and like it really
cleans your hair and it's I like that
one even better I can link it below but
this one I did like what do we need to
repurchase it not necessarily it's a
little bit pricier for what it is and
like there's the Neutrogena one that
works pretty well too and again I'm
really liking the brioche Eoin one of my
favorites the it cosmetics bye bye
makeup I've had so many of these some of
them I thought some of them have been
sent to me but it's one of my favorite
ways to remove makeup i always use
cleansing balms
i just feel like it's better for my skin
i'm not tugging as much as I am when I'm
using like cotton rounds or when I'm
using like an actual cleansing you know
like a cleansing wipe I just love it and
this is absolutely one of my favorites I
feel like I fly through it though and
again these aren't cheap but it's
totally worth the money it's so good and
then the next one I used up was the
origins original skin cleansing makeup
removing jelly jelly I always want to
say jello this stuff is absolutely just
as good I love the smell of this and you
might let grab it be like oh it doesn't
have a smell cuz it doesn't but there's
some slight scent to it when I actually
use it that like every time I did it I
was like oh my gosh I love the smell I
don't it's like the slightest thing and
maybe it's again because I'm pregnant
and I can like smell I don't know but I
was really sad to have this gone I think
this is one I would totally repurchase
as well and I do like that this isn't a
squeezy two versus a big jar I feel like
you're not getting like gross fingers in
there every single time you know but
they both remove makeup really really
well oh this is one from Tyler an empty
he's so sweet because he always asks
like hey I finished that a you know
serum or moisturizer whatever do you
want it like for your empties I'm like
sure did you like it it's just cute but
he really liked this this is this brand
lab series I'd never heard of until I
again I found it on HauteLook and I
bought him like a set and it's supposed
to be for men of course you don't have
to have some things for men and women
but it just happened to be a for men
line and it's their ageless
power V lifting cream and he said you
really really liked it the packaging was
kind of cool too
so if you ever see this brand he seemed
to like everything that was in the
little kit that I bought him speaking of
skincare I finished one from the
ordinary this is their buffet
serum so it's basically most of the
ordinary products are like singular
ingredient kinds of serums and things
but this was a mixture of a lot of good
ingredients so it truly was more of a
classic serum I really did like this but
I buy it again yes now I have so many
serums to get through it's crazy cuz I
want to try a bunch more out so I don't
need to repurchase this now would I
recommend and what I repurchase
absolutely it's probably my favorite one
of my favorite from the ordinary I also
really like their hyaluronic acid like
serum oh another orb a product I had
from some support perk they're super
fine hairspray really really good
honestly very similar to their
texturizing spray and I would prefer the
texturising I also okay actually I had
to call this one quits
this is the pistach skincare pistachio
oil bottle but body butter Wow smells
amazing but there was maybe one or two
more uses and I was like I can't do any
more it is such a strong smell now this
smell is amazing it really is
I love pistachios I love pistachio
freaking ice cream that sounds so good
right now anyway um but this smell is so
strong that after putting on every
single morning I was done
by the end I was like I cannot handle
this smell anymore
I really couldn't cuz it is really
strong but it smells amazing so it's
kind of like you know if you can I don't
know again could have been because I was
pregnant it really could have been but I
really got tired of the smell
I guess that's all saying but an amazing
body butter amazingly moisturizing oh
yeah this is from PI Shao this is their
hydrating ritual mask and you just put
it on in your hair like in the shower
and then you can leave it in for a few
minutes then rinse out I really liked it
it was only lips a couple of uses but it
definitely felt super moisturizing you
know kind of holding my ends together it
just felt really really nice I was
pretty impressed
would I buy like a su mean this is not a
full size I would buy a full size of
this I really liked it oh we have a lot
of makeup done here let me finish this
haircare though this is the caviar CC
cream ten in one complete correct
correction again I have a little bit
left in here
I liked this a lot but for me I want a
product that I can put in and let my
hair air dry and then it kind of just
does the work for me
and this didn't do that I like it best
when I'm blow-drying my hair like I'll
put this in in the blow dryer but I
don't blow dry my hair all the time and
so it's a leave-in hair Perfector I
really did like it it's highly
recommended by so many websites and
magazines and you know and I did like it
but do I think I'll buy it again
probably not I finished up the Elgin is
complete I renewable this stuff is
amazing it's one of my one of my
preferred I creams although it's still
not my favorite but I do really really
like this I certainly like this better
than the what was the one the curly one
this is definitely better but again in
the jar I felt like it lasted so long
and I was dipping my fingers in it
constantly that I'm like I think I'd
rather it being a sweetie to but that's
just my own that's me you know what I
mean that doesn't mean you shouldn't get
it because it really is nice the embryo
lease late it's basically a milk cream
concentrate I'm just translating it
really good moisturizer this is like
beloved by makeup artists across the
world and that's why I was excited to
try it so I traveled with this sucker
I've already bought a full size because
I found it at Tarr
and I was like I didn't know they sold
em released and they only have a few
things but I bought the full-size and
I'm you excited to crack it open cuz I
loved this stuff it's one of those
moisturizers you can throw on at night
if you want but you could also put on
right before putting on makeup and it
works really well
oh I did have a finished version of my
the Kiehl's midnight recovery eye I've
already repurchased the full size of
this I really really this is the eye
cream I would recommend more than the
other ones I really like this I also I'm
just getting rid of because it's been
years my wet and wild single in Brule
the old one I have a new one with the
new packaging cuz I've had this one for
years and the packaging broke I already
hit pan on the new one though that's
crazy I love this stuff it is the
probably my most used single shadow in
my collection because I use it every day
I'll do it on my brow bone I'll do it
just all over to blend it's so so good
if you're if you're near my skin tone
another lash paradise told you I makeup
remover pen from ELF I always have one
of these they're like three bucks you
can use it to clean up your wing etc the
number seven radiant glow concealer my
favorite concealer and there might be a
little bit left in here and just a
little bit just a really amazing
probably top five concealers that I own
brightening you know enough coverage
it's not super high coverage but it
blends so quickly you can just feel like
put it on and go like this and it's
blended in I'm like how did it blend
that fast it's so so good definitely
recommended I already have my next one
open the hourglass 1.5 millimeter
eyeliner I love it's in the shade
obsidian which is their black I love it
because it's so thin it stays on really
well it glides on here's the thing you
go through this in like a month
no like three weeks I literally traveled
with one of these and I swear to you I
opened it only a week before traveling I
ran out on the trip I'm like what it was
literally like two-and-a-half weeks and
it was gone I'm like I don't even it was
crazy
so it's I keep telling myself just cuz
then just stop buying it but I really
really love it so I'd recently bought a
three pack of these on Sephora and you
know I'm still gonna keep using them but
I'm like should I stop buying them cuz
I'm really going through the best but
they're my favorite the nourish organic
eye
this has just gone bad I didn't use it
quickly enough I like a lot of nourished
organic products that I've tried in the
past I had some cleanser that I really
really liked I had in my shower for a
long time so I like the brand I just
didn't use this quickly enough probably
because I didn't love love I didn't
think it was bad
it's got kind of like a metal lid to
make it feel cool all it does actually
feel really good um but I just I waited
too long and I had already opened it and
I'm an idiot but really good ingredients
in these products too
alright and then my Milani stay-put
waterproof eyeliner pencils just about
on its last leg favorite drugstore liner
period it's so so good
I've already did I rebuy another one no
it's on my list of things that I need to
repurchase it's it's the best
and then the NYX epic ink ink liner my
favorite drugstore liquid liner I
already have another one and frankly
that one's almost gone as well my
absolute favorite it's like the only one
I use anymore it's what I use every day
to do my kind of mini wing without fail
it's so amazing I freaking love this
stuff
also the dr. teals pure Epsom salt this
is their relax and relief which
eucalyptus and spearmint I've already
repurchased this this really works like
if you've got pregnancy aside because I
loved this way before Epsom salt really
does relax your muscles and this kind of
has yea eucalyptus spearmint and so it
just smells good too it kind of clears
your nasal passages just a bit and it's
just awesome like I've tried the other
ones of the dr. teals and I really like
all of them but the relax and relief one
is my favorite and actually like now
that I'm thinking about Mike I might
crack open my new one and get it back
here soon because my legs are really
tired they're just sore and I always
feel so good when I get out my legs
don't feel sore anymore and oh this
stuff is like a saving grace and I love
that it's like a Velcro top which I know
sounds weird but it like it's the
perfect thing for this highly recommend
and these are under $10 like I want to
say this is maybe six bucks for the
giant bag that's it I did it and I'm
only slightly sweaty alright so if you
