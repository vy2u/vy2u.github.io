filming my may favorites and fails
I don't know I'm like so excited to film
this video today I'm filming a bunch of
videos today and I think I'm just having
so much fun it's been a couple weeks
since I've sat down to film I've been
uploading videos I pre filmed and I'm
just so excited like to talk to you guys
and share what I'm loving so I hope that
you will stick around subscribe if you
are not already subscribed tap the
little Bell get notified when I upload a
new video because I get so excited to
share them with you guys today I have so
many new favorites and so many crappy
products let's go and get into it wait
really hype right now I'm done with
teaching right now for the summer so I
have way more energy because I'm like
sleeping so much more it's awesome
okay let's start with a really weird one
I want to talk about this deodorant guys
I finally you're welcome I finally found
a natural deodorant that works it
actually works guys you don't stink
through it and I okay this is the
Schmidt's natural deodorant I don't know
where this has been all my life here's
what I will say it does not stop sweat
okay so if that's what you're looking
for no for me I'm like I don't care if I
sweat I really don't especially in the
summer Mike I'm usually wearing a tank
top anyway so it doesn't it's not like
it's showing through that's not what I
was looking for I was looking for a
deodorant that D odor Rises so I wasn't
as worried about the antiperspirant part
of it this stuff smells like a dream
bergamot and lime it smells like a
freaking lime margarita or something
delicious it smells like sprite honestly
I love the smell I have gone to the gym
I play like a staff versus fifth grade
volleyball game I've been really nervous
for something I recently did and I was
like sweating a ton I've done so many
different activities where I totally
should have smelled myself do you know
what I mean and I didn't and I was so
like I have tried probably ten natural
deodorants I've tried the toms one that
la vanilla won the every every kind
that's out there I swear to you and I
saw this at a store near me the other
day and I'm like I've never seen that
and it says
award-winning natural formula I'm like
what so I bought it and why please work
please work it works it works enough
that when I travel abroad here very soon
this is going with me and not my
original dove stuff that's probably
killing me slowly so I am so excited
like they said it doesn't stop the sweat
but it smells amazing it is kind of
weird they tell you to kind of put it on
your underarms let it heat up for a
second and then swipe because it does
have these like granules to it and so it
almost leaves it's almost like
exfoliating in a way it feels like
you're putting an exfoliator suspended
within a cream on your underarms but I
don't mind it because it actually works
and it smells really good and I just
can't believe it I just can't believe it
so also they sell out at Target I just
looked it up it's $4.99 at Target I will
link it below they also have lavender
sage which I think I smelled there and
it's still smelled pretty good I was
just really feeling the lime one and I
see there's a rose and vanilla deodorant
but it's like a travel size from Etsy
that doesn't make sense my next favorite
is this super cheap product it's from
essence is their Sun Club matte bronzing
powder this is a huge pan like the size
of my palm and it smells like suntan
lotion in a good way in my opinion it's
in the shade 0-1 natural I think they
had maybe another shade or two it's like
under five dollars you get a ton of
product it reminds me of a better
version of the NYC sunny bronzer
remember that stuff I didn't love it
just because for me I'm just too fair so
it never looked good on me this is just
a little bit lighter than that and I
think a little bit more creamy of a
product and you probably can't even see
it because it really is just a little
bit bronzer bronzer bronzer then my skin
just sounds weird because we say bronzer
too so to use it as like a comparative
adjective sounds weird bronzer it looks
bronzer which is right it's more bronze
that's probably correct right I love
this stuff it's so like I'll describe
any brush just swirl it in it and swirl
it on and I feel like it looks so just
warm and summery and I just
love that I love that feeling I love
that it's huge so I can just wear all
giant brush in it just throw it on you
could probably bronze your body with it
if you want by the way if you're looking
at me right now and you're like two
sides of your face look different which
hopefully you're not
I have half of my face high-end and half
of it drugstore for a video I filmed
today a dupes video that I'm very proud
of if it is up I will link it below if
it's not definitely stay tuned search
around because it's awesome and it's
almost an entire full face of drugstore
dupes in like all the drugstore dupes
are as good if not better than the
high-end and I'm so excited about it so
let's go undo it done this is the
model's own face base its hindi
illuminating shady i did a whole video
about model's own and they had some
great products and some terrible
products they're new to alta they've
been elsewhere not in the states for a
while and so it's new to the United
States and the illuminating one it was
just glittery it looked crazy on my face
you can even see in that video I just
felt like it it was just all bad so for
me it's a huge pass I would be
interested to try the other primers
because they do have other ones and I
like the packaging it's a squeezy tube
and then it's a pump which i think is
great
but they're kind of one of those brands
that they're not like five dollar
products there are step above so it's
not like essence or NYC it's like the
higher end of like L'Oreal do you know
what I mean so they've got more
expensive products like your pallets are
almost twenty dollars this I want to say
was around 15 and so you're kind of
expecting a little bit step above and I
feel like a lot of the products I tried
were not that way there were some
products I liked if you're interested
definitely check it out
I've got a lot of glowy products that
I'm very excited about so this one is
new it's a Milani product it's called
their prep set glow illuminating
transparent powders got nice packaging
it's I don't even know how to describe
this it's like a powder it reminds me of
the hourglass dim light powder because
it's not meant to be a highlight it's
meant to be an all-over powder that just
makes your skin look glowy without
looking glittery or shimmery so you
don't have to target it in a certain
area
just kind of put it everywhere and I
love it I think it looks so natural I do
think that in certain lighting because
it is more of a cheaper powder that I
can kind of look like oh she's wearing
some powder does that make sense a
little bit powdery but not enough that
it makes me not want to wear I still
want to wear it all the time so what's
weird though is I can already see the
pan below it like not literally see the
silver pan but like you can see the
indent of it so they must have this must
not be very much product at all point
three ounces what's normal now that's
like a normal amount
comparing to some other stuff so I don't
know either way it's really nice if you
can get your hands on it I'm really
liking it if you don't want to fork out
the money for the hourglass one buy this
one it has this same effect it's
beautiful so the next one when my good
friends Laura told me about and she I'd
been borrowing hers forever and I
finally bit the bullet and just bought
it it's the pure illuminating powder and
afterglow I've been using hers every
time we go anywhere together and she has
it I'm like can I use that it's why is
not everyone talking about this it's the
most gorgeous highlighter I've ever seen
it's like a golden yellow a champagne
it's not glittery at all it's one of
those highlighters that you put on and
you see someone else wearing it you're
like what highlighter are they wearing
why is that so perfect it's this kind of
a highlighter like it's it just look
it's like glowy but it's more than just
lit from within it's just I don't know
how to describe it do you see me like
fumbling for my words it's one of those
that if I use it up which there's a
great chance I might I will buy it again
because I've never tried anything like
this if you're in an Ulta go swatch it
try it out put it on it's one of those
things that it stays on and you look at
yourself in the mirror and you're like
oh my gosh my highlight looks so nice
it's that kind of a highlight next
favorite is from milk it's their milk
makeup matcha toner I just filmed today
a video about a ton of milk products
because I've had so many questions about
them but this is a standout product of
theirs I loved their blur stick I loved
their I Pig
but this is something that's kind of
revolutionary it's the first stick toner
and for me someone I'm married to a
travel agent we travel all the time this
is huge because I would love to travel
with a toner but I never ever ever have
because I always carry my stuff on no
matter where we're going no matter how
long we're gone I always carry on I
never check a bag and because of that I
only have so much space for liquids and
me being a makeup obsessed skincare
obsessed nerd I want to bring everything
but I can't so now this is something
that it won't take up any room in my
liquids bag and I can actually have a
toner and when you travel I mean travel
is notorious especially if you're flying
for ruining your skin drying it out
you're in a different climate so many
things can go wrong and so keeping with
your skincare regimen is really helpful
when you're traveling and so having
something like this I mean it's
literally a toner made from matcha and
it's a video about all these products is
up I'll link that as well I don't think
it will be up yet but it doesn't really
have a noticeable smell at all but it's
just this amazing stick that you just
put all over your face before you
moisturize and stuff and it just kind of
refines your pores and sucks up any
excess oil it's just perfect it's so
cool I loved it and I thought maybe it's
a little gimmicky but as I tried it for
the past few weeks I'm like okay it's
actually really good okay next one why
is no one talking about this these are
the wet and wild color icon loose
pigments I bought just one because I
wanted to try it out it's called domme
and cherry on top it looks very similar
to the Mac pigment and tan and I almost
used it in the dupes video I filmed but
I didn't because they are a little bit
different but they're very very similar
but pigments can be very expensive for
example the Mac pigments you know the
tiny size of ten bucks the full size is
like twenty bucks this was probably
under five dollars it is so beautiful
the packaging is so cool it has this
little flip top that you can flip open
after you unscrew the lid and then you
can dump it on you know whatever you
want I usually put it on my hand and
then
on my butt it's just a cool packaging
idea but on top of that it's a beautiful
color I really really love it it's so
pretty on the lid just as a wash of
color you could totally wet it and put
it on your inner corner you could still
wet it put on your lip whatever you want
to do but it's so cheap it's kind of
those things that I'm like I kind of
wanted to just go by every shade they
have because it's just such an
inexpensive way to have a lot of
different options with something like
that and you can do so much with
pigments which is awesome so yay for one
wild gay for cheap beautiful drugstore
pigments next favorite is what I'm
wearing today's the foundation I'm
wearing this is the covergirl vilas
healthy elixir foundation it's just
pretty they claim that it's full
coverage no it's not it's medium
coverage max but it's got a pump it's
beautiful packaging not a noticeable
smell it has SPF of 20 healthier vitamin
type ingredients and I feel like when I
apply it to my skin it just makes my
skin look healthy and that I can still
breathe and I don't feel like it
prematurely ages me which is huge
because I'm kind of starting to realize
like man some of these foundations I'm
wearing really make me look older than I
am and so I'm like why I need to be
embracing my 20s I've only got like two
more years of being in my 20s so anyway
so I'm really liking this foundation for
that so if that sounds like it's up to
your alley I would definitely recommend
it a dud
is one I'm not even gonna devote that
much time to it's the hard candy
glamoflauge mix and drops in radiant I
have their like pigment drops that are
like the cover FX those are great this
and I know a lot of you guys have told
me the same thing is like the weirdest
like you can't mix it up it's like half
liquid half chunk and it no matter how
how many minutes you shake it it roll it
it doesn't matter it's the same
consistency I don't know if it's like
because it's old or what but I just
bought it so either it was sitting in
the store a long time or some weird
batch that like all of us got I did see
one youtuber I don't remember who it was
say they loved this so I don't know
maybe we all did get a bad batch but the
only reason I'm mentioning this is to
tell you to stay far far away just in
case next favorite is very very new to
me the
the Knicks dose of do face gloss it
reminds me of my RMS beauty living
Luminizer which is really expensive I
love it but that's like in a pot and
it's kind of dewy and glossy and you can
kind of tap it here and instead of a
highlighter it's just kind of a glossy
kind of catches the light really pretty
trendy look well this is the same thing
but I think it's almost easier to apply
because you could just go and then just
tap it in you could put it on your hand
and do that you could tap the sponge
right into it tepid oh I mean there's
ten million ways you can apply it but
this is just so beautiful so inexpensive
it really is more of a gloss it's not a
highlighter although you'd put it in the
same spot you'd put highlight yeah hey I
don't think it's really a shade it's
just called dosa do face gloss but I
think the packaging is cute really
convenient for travel I'll probably
bring it with me we'll see well that's
gonna be tough decisions right there
anyway but I love it definitely go pick
it up before it sells out all right so I
have one more favorite one more fail
another favorite this is a weird one it
kind of snuck in without me really
realizing it and it's the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer this is one that I
purchased and I don't know like I
thought oh it just going to be like a
normal concealer but I really wanted to
try it there's something about this it's
got a really flat applicator and I just
really quick I've been using this like
every single day it just looks like
natural but still perfected and I feel
like that's so hard to find it a
concealer even a tart shaped tape I feel
like I keep trying it trying to figure
out like what does everyone love about
this I like it but I don't think it's
like groundbreaking and you know I've
used it so many ways I've applied in so
many ways I've used less I've used more
I've used sponges and brushes and
fingers and oh my and I just feel like I
like this better it's just more normal
and it still perfects what I need to but
it blends in a little bit easier and it
wears really well throughout the day it
doesn't make me look older than I really
am yet again that's like the theme of
the video I really like it if you're
looking for something and you're not
really into the Tarte shaped tape or
maybe you're just similar to me I think
you'd really like it this is one that I
think if I ran out I would probably go
back and repurchase okay the last one I
keep going back and forth with I posted
this about this on Instagram a long time
ago I got it for free from octoly a
while ago the Clarins for color
all-in-one pen what a cool idea it's
like those pens from the 90s 80s
whenever it was and it's different
eyeliners different colors so they have
a dark oh they have a black a dark brown
a light brown which apparently is for
lips and a blue so there's three
eyeliners in one lip color how do I get
it there we go and like once you choose
a color you just spin it to get it to
come up through as well awesome idea so
fun not very creamy eyeliners I've made
them work I've used a lot of them I
haven't used the lipliner honestly I
just don't really have a desire it's
kind of a color that it's like a light
nude that I don't know I've just not had
the desire but even the black I feel
like I have made it work and it does
once it's on it stays in place and
that's what I like about it but it's
just I don't know it doesn't feel very
comfortable to use it's not terrible and
I almost didn't mention it but I'm like
no I feel like mentioning it because
they're still really pigmented but it
does it's almost like you scrape your
eye to get it on because of no matter
how much I sharpen it still just feels
kind of rough I don't know how else to
describe it so if you're dying to try it
go for it but it's really pricey and I
feel like you could buy all of these
colors separately from like Rimmel
scandaleyes or Milani and get way better
quality and still spend less than you
would buy this all-in-one pen so those
are all my favorites and fails for the
month of May I hope that you enjoyed it
if you did please give it a thumbs up
definitely check out my other videos I
do lots of drugstore and high-end on my
channel and subscribe while you're here
