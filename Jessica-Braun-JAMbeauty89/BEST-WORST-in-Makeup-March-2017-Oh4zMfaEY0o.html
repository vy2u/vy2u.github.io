here and if I find it there's a bird
soaring yesterday inside another place
what bird you are never going to get out
of this store huh game here
hey guys it's Jessica and today I'm
going to share with you my March best
and worst my favorite videos to film I
don't know though because my anti haul
that I filmed has like crept up that was
so freaking fun to film but I don't know
regardless I love doing these videos
let's go and get into it so I'm gonna do
all of my favorites first and they're
going to end I have one two three
products that I did not like unless I
like to think of another one midway
through filming it's very possible so my
first favorite is a rediscovered one and
it's one I actually just bought this
2-pack I have one out that I use theirs
today it's the Real Techniques sponge I
forgot how good these work I don't know
if I like the clutter at once because
maybe it was really old I just have like
a 1 pack when I first tried it out quite
a while ago but these are the closest
thing to a beauty blender i have found
ever and and they get just this big
right so this is the original they're
just as great at blending I can never
tell the difference when I'm using this
versus a beauty blender I have like 6
beauty blenders but I'm so glad I have
these now because they sell them in two
packs which is awesome and I just
they're so good and if you're on a
budget just buy a one pack try it out
especially if you've never tried the
Beauty Blender and you're not even sure
if you would even like it well don't
spend the money on it and then buy it
and then end up not liking using a
sponge to apply your makeup you know
what I mean
better to do this and then you'll
probably realize how much you like this
you don't even need the Beauty Blender
so something to think about but it was
rediscovered and I love it now let's
talk about my hair because I've gotten
so many questions the thing I think
right now that's making my wavy ish
frou-frou hair work a little bit better
is this so I've done videos on how I do
my hair I did a sponsored video with
Issa lon maybe a year ago I can link it
below I love their products I've used
them all up
I just haven't repurchase them in a
while but I have this kind of in my like
drawer of hair extras and
so it's the living proof curl enhancing
styling this this is the second one I've
had this stuff
volumizing your hair knows it's the
second day hair so if you've seen it
yesterday or in my past videos that was
like first day hair this stuff makes all
the difference
it just volumizes it holds your curls
together so I kind of do like a trifecta
what I do in my hair is wet is I used my
Rusk like cream and I put that all
throughout my hair my hair is upside
down when I'm doing this then I get a
bunch of this mousse in my hands and I
kind of scrunch it into my hair upside
down and then I spray it with a really
good hairspray all over then I do my
makeup let my hair kind of air dry so
for about maybe 30 40 minutes my hair's
air drying while I'm getting ready then
by the time that's all sunk into my hair
I make up scent then I flip my head
upside down with a diffuser and blow-dry
it and that's what makes it look I mean
a little bit better than it does today
but I really think this is the miracle
worker there I don't think it's
necessarily the cream or the hairspray I
really think it's this it's really
pricey but if you've tried a lot of
stuff and you're just not impressed or
maybe you did never try mousse in
general try a mousse I think you'll be
impressed
Lew seems very old-fashioned to me my
mom used it like when I was a kid I
remember and I remember thinking like
well I like what does that even do but
it worked now if you don't have hair
that naturally is wavy or anything you
might not it might not work I don't know
my hair like when I was growing up like
a toddler my hair was just curls coming
out so this is my natural state another
favorite that was kind of rediscovered
in my collection is that number 7 lift
and luminate foundation I've had this
for probably close to a year is now
maybe a couple months shy of that and I
remember when I first got it mentioning
it and saying guys this is amazing I
recently saw I think it was
kathleenlights talked about it and I'm
like I totally forgot about that so I
dug it out of my collection and use it
again and I was like that is why I loved
it so much it really is as she says just
a beautiful foundation it lets your skin
breathe it's gotten I would say medium
coverage it's certainly not a full
coverage but it's not like a BB cream
either it really is right in the middle
it just makes your skin look dewy
without looking shimmery or anything
like that it's so beautiful
this shade is the perfect
for me it's warm ivory which is funny
because I have another number seven one
but stay perfect which I also like I got
this and warm ivory and it was too dark
so it does kind of I think very range to
range but I love this stuff so much it's
got a pump it's just fantastic
absolutely fantastic now if you like
really matte skin you won't like this
but if you feel like you tried dewy
foundations in there too dewy I think
you'll like this because this is right
in between next product is this essence
lash princess mascara I feel like I've
talked it to death on my snapchat and
everywhere else but I love it it's like
a couple dollars it did take about a
week of kind of opening it and closing
it you know every few day for awhile for
it to actually do what people said it
does which is really volume is really
separate I mean it is amazing mascara
holds onto your curl and it's like a
couple dollars so you guys know I love
my eight cosmetic superhero mascara this
stuff is just as good absolutely love it
now today I'm not wearing it I was
trying out a new mascara that I don't I
can't decide if I love or hate but I
really like this stuff next product is
from Milani it's their retouching a rape
light lifting concealer oh my gosh oh
this stuff is so good now the packaging
is kind of weird I have it in the
lightest shade zero one fair it's got
this like sponge and you squeeze it and
it comes up through it but I'll just
take that and just go and then I can
take my you know sponge and really blend
it in there and it just is so flawless
so beautiful in a way it reminds me of
like the Tarte shaped ape Kat Von D or
it's got really high coverage it's
really comfortable to wear I don't know
I haven't tried it side-by-side but I
love wearing this and there's a reason
this isn't my favorite than those two or
not I love those two but this one is
just as good and it's so much cheaper so
if you can find Milani or maybe ordered
online totally worth it another
rediscovered favorite is my wet wild
single shadow in Brule this stuff is so
good it's packed such a punch for
something that's like a dollar
ninety-nine it's just this matte cream
color and I like to put it right under
my brow
alone and it just makes your brow stand
out so well again I was trying something
else out today so I didn't use it but
I've been using it everyday for the past
month it's so perfect for that and it's
perfect you know if you're using a
palette that doesn't have something like
this you can just grab this and know
that it is absolutely foolproof this
next product is this pure no filter blur
in photography primer I got this through
austell a recently for free and so I've
been trying it out and I'm kind of on
the fence for a while but then I used it
two more and I realized how good this
stuff is it's something that you can
either mix with your foundation you can
put it on alone you could put it as a
targeted highlighter you could actually
use it as a primer but it's got this
dropper and it's a kind of sheer ooh I
need to shake it up you gotta shake it
up but I think the packaging is really
cute I like that it's smaller not huge
and taking it tons of room but it's it's
kind of sheer oh that's way too much so
I guess I shouldn't say sheer but it
ends up being a lot more sheer and it's
just this beautiful primer that catches
the light so when you use way less and
put it on under a foundation especially
if it's a mattifying foundation this has
a great job of making you look like
you're glowing from within and like I
said if you've got a really drawing or
mattifying foundation you want to mix it
with it that looks beautiful
I even done it where I kind of mix it on
my hand grab my Beauty Blender and just
put it in those strategic kind of
highlight areas and it just looks so
beautiful so I really really like it now
could you find a drugstore one that's
probably somewhat similar maybe I
haven't found anything that's as
translucent as this because like I said
this is such a good mix where it's not
so thick and like opaque as a
highlighter it's right in between and
that's why I think it looks great as a
primer and mixed with so really really
liked this a lot actually
okay let's move on to the mrs. first one
I got to be honest it's not even the
quality of this this is by the way if
you didn't recognize it it's the Too
Faced peanut butter and honey palette I
just don't like the colors like I don't
I just they sent me this for free a
while ago and I've literally pulled it
out like maybe ten times I've never used
it
that's how uninspired I learn ever felt
this way about Apollo I would pull it
out they all want to use that today and
I pull it out and open it and I think
okay what am I going to do here and I
think oh well maybe I'll use this peanut
butter shade kind of a warm medium brown
I'll use that in the crease and then I'm
like and then well what will I put on
the lid and like I don't really like
those colors then I'm like well maybe
outer corner I'll be going nuts or maybe
I'll do that as a liner and then as I
think through I'm like I don't want to
use this like I'm not inspired by it at
all and I'm sorry I know a lot of people
really like this like I said it's not
the quality it's totally totally my
taste my preference and I'm just not
inspired by these colors in any way and
when I use the palette I like to be able
to use mostly that path sometimes you
know you might have to dig into another
for something else
but I mean I felt like I truly could
barely get a complete look out of this
that I personally liked so this is a
total subjective you know issue where I
just didn't like the colors like the
quality is not bad I mean it's like any
cube a shadows I like to face showers
for the most part but this one I was
just I don't know I just didn't like it
next products that were kind of misses
this is the G Bashi preed Mei Libre
powder now I don't I maybe I should put
this in the middle it's kind of a mess
product it is crazy expensive I'll put
the price of it on the screen right now
because I don't know the price on in my
head but it's the idea of it is that you
get these four different colors there's
a light green purple kind of a whitish
and blue and they kind of mix together
to kind of let the light bounce off your
face well and it can still mattify and
make it kind of blurred and perfected
but it really just ends up looking
really white on my face and I would say
I'm pretty darn fair and it still
doesn't really work for me it's not like
I said it's not like the worst powder
I've ever tried I mean it shouldn't be
at the price tag but it just was one
that I'm like you know for daddy
Benson it's nothing life-changing and
when I'm this was sent to me through
octal II as well and so if I were to
have gone out and bought this on my
island I would have been so upset that
it wasn't life-changing because it's so
expensive and something that expensive
should be life-changing because there
are amazing drug store powders like the
NYC translucent powder is really good
and it's like four dollars so for that
reason you know it's not horrible but it
wasn't wowing and I did feel like it
kind of made my face book a little bit
ghostly so that reason I just that's why
it's kind of in my misses I just I
wouldn't recommend buying it last
product I have to mention if you saw my
snaps I usually show what I'm wearing in
the morning and what I think about it
things like that like many videos in the
morning I had the soap and glory love at
first blush they recently sent this to
me and I already previously owned their
peach Party one I love this one this one
I really like it's a peachy tone it's
definitely Glary well they sent the pink
one and I just felt like it looked so
patchy on my skin the peach one I didn't
notice that with but for some reason
this one did and there's not really a
reason it should so what I might use
this as is maybe it's like a blush
topper if I just want that frosty look
but I don't think I can use this as a
blush on its own because it looks so
splotchy and patchy in any redness I
already had I felt like it illuminated
that and in horrible way and so I don't
know I just really wasn't impressed
especially since I loved the peach party
one so much so I would say if you're
like dying to try one of these try the
peach one the pink one unless you just
want a blush topper I would stay away
from it because again it swatches
beautifully and I think if it had a
blush to play off of underneath it it
would look a lot better and less flashy
but on its own it was not pretty so
those are all of my best and worst for
March I hope you enjoyed I hope you'll
subscribe before you leave and say hi to
me on my social media which is June
beauty 89 and I will see you guys in my
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
