continuing with the tradition of doing
my Black Friday Sephora and Ulta deals
so this is kind of an alert video to let
you know what I would recommend from the
Black Friday deals that are going to be
going on with Sephora and Ulta I loved
doing this video last year and I was
actually wearing this fur vest in that
video I'll link my last year's video if
you're curious to see it but I thought
like I feel like it's a tradition so I
wanted to wear it again this is my first
time this season wearing it and I'm
filming a bunch of videos today so I'll
be wearing this and quite a few but I
just feel like it's like tritanus now
calm down it's faux fur please before I
get into the deals I always have to
mention for your benefit eBay you have
to go this is not sponsored they don't
know I'm talking about them yes I've
worked with them in the past he baits is
amazing I'm gonna say it really quickly
if you go to ebay to create an account
you basically anytime you shop online
you get money back straight to your bank
account I have made hundreds and
hundreds of dollars because I shop
online a lot especially during the
holidays because I know I'm going to buy
things on Amazon for my husband or for
my family I know I'm gonna buy makeup
for people from Sephora and Ulta so even
when you're getting these Black Friday
deals if you go to Ebates first type in
Sephora type in Ulta and go to it from
Ebates it'll automatically track
anything you purchase after clicking on
it and whatever percent cashback it is
say it's 10% or 20% you're getting that
money back so if you spend a hundred
bucks you're getting $10 back right in
your bank account or $20 it's that easy
that's simple it's not a scam by any
means at all so I will put the link
below if you're interested it is amazing
and totally worth the two minutes it
will take you to create an account
because you get money back so let us
start with Sephora because um I just
want to there's no reason I just want to
so they list their Black Friday deals on
their app so and I remembered that from
last year as well so I've got a bunch of
screenshots I will put on the screen of
the ones as I'm talking about them so
you can see what I am talking about so
the first one listed on there is the
Tarte intro to Tarte deluxe discovery
set this is gonna be ten dollars
originally thirty nine and it has one of
their blushes and the Tarte blushes are
incredible I mean for that alone for ten
that's a win but it also has the mascara
it looks like it's got a lipstick as
well so and I think they're all
full-sized so that's one I'm thinking
about purchasing just for myself because
I know all those products are really
nice and tarts just a great brand and
for ten bucks that's like unbelievable
you can't tell if they're full-size or
if it's like deluxe but they look big so
they might be full-sized they don't
really give you any details until it's
available
scrolling down they have an Olay Rula
Henriksen try us to love us on the glow
essentials now I tried a couple of their
products and I've really liked it I've
tried they always smell really nice and
I know some people like swear by it so
there's been nothing that I've tried
that I'm like oh I need to repurchase it
right away but they were good so it says
$15 to $29 value it looks like it comes
to three different products so if you're
really into skincare or you know there's
a product you'd like to try from them it
might be worth it one thing I'm also
thinking about getting is the Make Up
For Ever artist palette volume to
artistic now as I look at it kind of
looks like colors I probably wouldn't
use so maybe I won't but at $25 and they
say it's a 100 $36 value now would I
ever spend 136 dollars on it no so I
would say for that it's only worth it if
you know you love Make Up For Ever
shadows and you know those are colors
you'd wear otherwise I would just pass
on it
um the cleaner reserve rollerball
layering trio ornament clean I have one
of the clean fragrances and it smells so
good it really does I actually have it
in my desk at school and just throughout
the day if I just feel like freshening
up I'll just kind of roll some on my
neck and on my wrist I really like it
I'm not sure which one it is but I think
that's a cool little gift whether you
get it for yourself or you get it for
someone else that really likes perfume
just cuz it's cute
ten bucks $24 value awesome another one
I'm thinking about just because I like
the shades is this Sephora collection
the delicate eyeshadow palette for ten
dollars the shades just look really
pretty and soft and neutral and like
actual colors I'd wear and I think the
packaging looks cute but it's not
totally practical like considering I
might throw it in a makeup bag and try
and take it with me it's kind of a weird
triangular shape so I don't know but the
next one
speaking of perfume from earlier the
nest Oh de parfum travel spray trio for
$12 that I might buy the nest candles
are amazing I've smelled nests perfumes
but I've never owned any and I like that
they're smaller so for 12 bucks I could
try 3 different scents and see if
there's one I like genuinely like and
then I could ask for like for my
birthday which is in January you know
what I mean so again I think actually I
would go for the nest one over the clean
one if you were picking between them
also the living proof style lab kit
which I love this living proof like dry
shampoo and their curling products
that's ten dollars they have the milk
makeup headliner makeup set um I haven't
tried too much from milk yet I've got
some products that I'm wanting to try
out that I have in my collection I know
they're kind of getting really big right
now so if you're really into trying
products before they get really big I
don't know that might be worth it's $25
so it is a little part a little bit
pricier than the other products they
have the philosophy purity made simple
for 15 bucks it looks like it's a pretty
big well not really it's 12 ounces I
don't know philosophy can be kind of
pricey but I liked I've liked they're
like bubble bath and bath type products
but I don't know if I'd buy that for 15
even still honestly Too Faced better
than sex lash on and melt off set for 10
bucks they're not full-size so I mean I
feel like if that was the full-size
mascara that probably be worth it but if
you've never tried it that'd be a good
way to try it I don't know the melt off
I've never tried this that's that's
interesting to me okay this one I think
I am gonna buy this is the Sephora
collection essential rose skin trio and
it is $10 $18 value Sephora I'm like
face mask and mask foot mask start
getting really really big right now and
it looks like it might come with some
wipes and like a little like kind of
like nug shaped little maybe face mask
so I'm curious to try that it's just a
trio for 10 bucks but even still I might
that's one I might get this next one I
think I'm gonna buy its the Urban Decay
makeup lockdown travel duo it's 19 bucks
that comes with the primer potion in the
all-nighter spray I like that they're
travel sized just because for me I
actually do travel a lot so I would use
it but $19 is kind of pricey
considering at ulta trying to make sure
it's not supported yeah at Ulta you'll
see they have the Urban Decay primer
potion for like 10 bucks so I don't know
getting the all nighter travel is worth
another nine dollars on top of that this
next one I'm thinking about buying it's
the origins cult faves for 18 bucks it
comes with four of their facial it looks
like masks and cleansers that don't
think about getting just because I feel
like I haven't tried a lot of origins
and that's a cool way to try four
different products next josie maran
infinite argan enlightenment duo i tried
both of those things the 12 bucks that's
not bad
I liked her like hand cream type stuff
the like highlighting thing I liked as
well I just had a lot of so I think I
declared it just because like there are
a million products that are just like
that and I didn't think it was anything
special but it wasn't bad so if you
don't have any like of the like Becca
wands or anything that josie maran one
is just as good I'm gonna kind of skip
around to the ones I think might be
worth it
the tarte pretty little lip ease for ten
bucks that is not bad it comes with two
different lip products the alterna
haircare caviar volume trio kit I really
like the caviar CC cream for your hair
I've really been liking that but that's
not in this kit but I know that their
caviar line is like a best-selling line
so for ten bucks for some travel size it
might be worth it might not cover FX
radiant skin duo comes with their
illuminating primer I might get that ten
bucks and then their cover FX little
tiny looks like maybe a primer I don't
know or maybe it's like a highlighter I
really like their the cover FX calming
primer so I'm interested to try that
eliminating one they've got the bare
minerals your brilliant all over face
color and brushed you up for ten bucks
that's not bad actually considering it
comes with the little brush as well they
have the clinic take it all off duo for
ten bucks it comes to the mascara and
there I actually have one in front of me
I just got a point perk from Sephora
the other day and in it was the Clinique
take the day off cleansing balm and I
haven't tried it yet but I have heard
amazing things so this is probably the
size you
get in that clinic $10 do some urban
decay after dark travel pencil sets
that's 19 bucks and you get three now
their travel size so they are gonna be a
little bit smaller but I love the Urban
Decay eye liners and I used one to death
so that's one I might consider it comes
with a black a brown in a dark purple I
would probably use the black and brown
and maybe the dark purple skipping
through they've got a buxom license to
chill three-piece eye and lip collection
for 10 bucks looks like it comes with a
one shadow a small size of their lip
gloss and then like a one of their
pencils I love the bucks and lip glosses
a lot they tingle but they feel awesome
so that might be worth it and skipping
through they've got some first-day
beauty fab holiday trio I love all first
aid beauty products they're really good
still twenty bucks though which for a
Black Friday deal I don't know it says
it's a thirty to fifty value I would
think for I feel like that should be
like 15 that's Black Friday they have
the diva curl or David curl Ultra
moisture sampling kit for 12 bucks I've
heard that stuff is amazing for curly
hair I haven't tried it yet one thing I
think I'm gonna get my husband is the
Jack Black clean start for 15 dollars
comes with three different products he
really likes Jack Black products so I
know he'd probably like that um that's
all I mean I listed almost everything
that's on the app go download the app
you can see it all but I don't know I
feel like they've got a lot of good
stuff there
I think the Urban Decay liner sets
pretty cool the Sephora rose collection
I think the Tarte ten dollar set really
might be the best deal they've got going
on though so it's definitely worth
looking into but there's just a lot and
there were some things I didn't mention
that if you look on the app you'll see
them but a lot of good deals so let's go
ahead and move on to Ulta so Ulta has
kind of just some sporadic random deals
they have a bareMinerals deal two
different things
make them stare and make it glow and
they are like little one of them's a
smokey eye trio and then the make it
glow is the radiant 3-piece complexion
collection looks like there's two
different mineral powders and then a
brush but ten bucks that's not bad they
also have this NYX for $25 this NYX
little I think like an advent calendar
type of thing
it comes with twelve mini liquid
lipsticks
many eyeshadows so that could be worth
it for 25 bucks there many though but
you know let's keep skipping through
that first page of their ad I wasn't
really impressed with too much there so
the next page in their ad it's 15
dollars and under so one of my favorites
is the Smashbox Smashbox on Smashbox
Smashbox studio on the ghost shadow and
mascara it's 12 bucks but I love their
little shadow trios that was one of the
very first things that guys I'm like
itching am I like breaking out right now
uh Smashbox shadow trios were the very
first like high-end eyeshadow ever tried
and I loved it and I would use it like
crazy so I have like a special place in
my heart but you get that and you get
their full exposure mascara I don't love
their full exposure mascara but I know
some people do so it might just be my
lashes I like really volumizing but also
curling and lengthening and definition I
like it all and I didn't feel like that
one did too much for me they have this
Tarte double duty Beauty palette it says
it's a $96 value and it's $12 it looks
like it's got four shadows and then it's
got like maybe a blush underneath it
looks really interesting I've never
heard of it but for 12 bucks that is not
bad they have a duo of the malli lip
glosses for $15 that looks pretty nice
benefit has this $15 kit it's a
full-size of the benefit they're real
mascara which is pretty good
it has a hoola bronzer and I don't think
that's the full size but the hoola
bronzer which is really nice and high
beams so for 15 bucks you get to try
three products and one of them I mean
the full-size their real mascara is more
than $15 as it is so you're just getting
a bonus of two extra products and saving
a couple bucks one thing I think I'm
gonna buy for my husband is this
essentials for him and it's got all this
skincare it's got some Jack Black's a
lab some different stuff and it's $14.99
they also have skin essentials for her
same price and it's got some Mario
Badescu some looks like maybe purity
that's dry Vechten I can't tell it's
just got a ton of different products so
that's one that I think about buying for
myself because again you'd get tons of
different skincare you get to try it out
they've also got some $15 pure pallets I
like the pure eyeshadows to be honest
I've tried some and they were actually
pretty good they have this $25 in under
section looks like they've got a
philosophy set with
purity and hands of hope it's for
different things for 25 bucks that
actually looks like a pretty good deal
this brush set that I'm really thinking
about it's from Ecotools and it's got a
ton of brushes it's $10
I love the Eco tools brushes so that one
I think would be a stellar present for
anyone that really likes that stuff in
it just I mean $10 that's just like kind
of blowing my um my mind here they also
have a Real Techniques brush set for
1215 it looks like it comes with four
brushes those brushes are amazing they
have a tart set for 19 it's got a blush
a lip stick and a mascara that's the
stellar deal they have a two-faced deal
where it says lashes love and lipstick
it's got a mini melted lip gloss a mini
Too Faced better than sex mascara and
then a mini one of their blushes which
are amazing tons of stuff on there they
also have this laura geller one it's 18
bucks $64 value and it comes with it
looks like it comes with a gilded honey
little highlighter maybe a smaller
version and then also a liner and a
mascara so that's 18 bucks that's not
bad either let's go to the next page
this is what I was talking about earlier
they have these $8 Urban Decay primer
potion regularly 22 $24 so I think those
are the full-size I would buy it they're
their primary potions are great really
and you're never gonna see a deal better
than that throughout the year like at
all but I think they had a similar if
not the same deal last year which is
awesome because if it lasts you a year
then you can just buy your next one the
next year they also have a bunch of uLTA
Beauty things on sale you know they've
got like this huge set of all they're
like lip glosses for ten bucks you can
get sebastian hairspray for $8.99 which
i do like their sebastian hairspray they
always have their 5 for 5 dollar deals
which really that's gonna be better
they're like stocking stuffer little
things a lot of them are the old to
beauty brand some of them aren't though
like they've got some cheese stuff but
that's better if you can go in the store
to do and not necessarily online because
then you can just grab a bunch of things
think of who you need to buy things for
stocking stuffer ideas things like that
they also have these buy one get one
free uLTA Beauty Bath gift sets ornament
soaps all these cute little bat balm
type things I did a drugstore gift guide
and if it's not up yet stay tuned
subscribe
it's coming soon where I got a lot of
things from ulta a lot of cute bad
things that were really really cheap and
amazing so stay tuned for that not
already yet it's up I will link it um
they also have this OPI two for 12 these
mini lacquer trios they're regularly
like 11 bucks but you're basically
getting both for that price which is
pretty cool I feel like I'm talking
really fast but there's so much I want
to make sure you guys know about so they
have a bunch of mascaras that are up to
50% off they have the it cosmetics
hello lashes mascara is now twelve
Smashbox full exposure now 10 Urban
Decay big fattie mascaras 10 lancome
definicils mascara is oh it's a set so
it comes to the liner maybe a makeup
remover things like that and of course
the mascara it's 34 but it's a $68 value
kind of depends now if that's a mascara
you already love and you already like
those products that probably worth it
they also have fragrance kits that are
$15 there's a men's one and a women's
one and then they have some stuff from
the body shop and it cosmetics brush set
for $12 regularly 24 and it's a $66
value it cosmetics brushes are
incredible so if you're looking for some
really nice ones those are really really
good as well but honestly it might be a
better deal just to get the Ecotools one
that's such a good deal I really do you
think I'm gonna buy that of course they
have their few dollars and 50 cents off
coupon that you can use it's off of $15
or more which I'm sure you will spend
over $15 you can use it online and in
store just search online for it but
honestly I kind of feel like Ulta has
better deals this year than Sephora did
know they both have good deals and again
it's kind of more dependent on what
kinds of products you're looking for or
if there's something very specific that
you were looking for for trying for
yourself or for someone else but both
good deals but I'm kind of leaning
towards like I feel like Ulta has a
little bit more to offer this year and
of course Ulta has a little more leeway
because they do have that drugstore end
of things as well so they've got more to
choose from in that respect I hope that
this video was helpful for you guys I
hope that you'll use Ebates I hope that
you will check me out on my social media

Black Friday blogging and snapping I'll
