doing my next declutter series I've got
like I think 10 to 12 videos I've
already filmed it all I did it over the
course of two days which is usually what
I do when I'm in that declutter mindset
I just want to attack it I wanted to
give you guys some quick tips of how you
know the mindset I like to use when I
declutter if you're not interested at
all go ahead and fast forward to this
time stamp right there on the screen
that way you can just get straight to
the declutter everyone else if you want
to stick with me my tips are first of
all the price tag does not matter period
if it was an $80.00 blush that you spent
a lot of money on and you know genuinely
it either looks terrible on you or
you're just not using it get rid of it
it doesn't matter if it was $80 because
guess what you've already spent that
money you've already wasted it so
keeping in your collection isn't getting
you that money back it isn't you know
the waste is already has already
occurred so you know you could either
give it away gift it to someone that
might love it or you could sell it on
stuff like Poshmark I use people who
sell so I've sold stuff on Instagram
before because then you can at least get
some money back where it wasn't as much
of a waste and then you could spend that
money on something you will use so don't
view decluttering as for yourself
wasteful it's more of a way of sharing
the love you know with other people that
are either not as fortunate or you know
would love it like I know my sister's
love this stuff that I let them go
through and I declutter but also you
could get some of your money back by
selling some of those more expensive
items so just keep that in mind now of
course some stuff you might not want to
sell if you used like you know obviously
mascara if you used it that's not right
other things you can sanitize you can
sanitize lipsticks and powders and
things like that
the next tip would be compare colors and
formulas if you have five bright pink
lipsticks and you know you probably
don't wear it very often you probably
only need one of them or it might be
that you know color wise you just don't
wear that you don't have to have a
bright pink lipstick in your collection
if you don't wear it and that's another
thing that's really kind of empowering
when you realize you know oh I feel like
I have to have a red lipstick and a pink
lipstick and a peach one if you know
peach looks terrible on you and you're
never gonna wear it anyway then why even
have in your collection who cares if you
have a peach one in your collection
you're not gonna wear it another mindset
that I didn't use for this declutter but
I've used it in my declutter where I got
rid of like 70% of my collection and all
they
that video below in that declutter my
mindset was I just spread all my makeup
out and I would look and just pick out
all my favorites and then really you can
just get rid of everything else because
once you have your favorites collected
and you passed up on anything else out
there then it probably is not something
you need to keep because once you go
through it one by one it does make it I
will admit even though I filmed these
video one by one I do think it makes it
easier for you to talk yourself into
keeping it because you're going to
swatch it think oh it's so pretty but if
you know you haven't reached for it and
when you had it in a pile and you didn't
pick it out as one of your favorites
then it's probably not one you need to
keep so it's kind of tricky and there's
so many different ways to declutter
different mentalities and so like I said
I'm not using that mentality for this
one but I do feel like that one's a
really really effective one and it's one
that like when I when you do con Mari I
did Mike and Mari clothing declutter and
I got rid of a ton and I have that video
as well if you want to see the actual
process of me going through it that was
kind of the process where you hold each
thing and you asked like does it bring
me joy do I love it and that's kind of a
mixture of the two because you are doing
it one by one but you're kind of asking
yourself you know you're being real with
yourself and I think my last tip is just
that at the end of the day it's just
makeup we do end up having I think a lot
of us we have an attachment to some of
it some of its sentimental some of it is
just like you just love it and if some
people are collectors they don't want to
do clutter and I would figure that if
you really are a collector that you like
having all this stuff you probably don't
get much out of declutter videos anyway
because it's just it's just a different
mindset and there's nothing wrong with
either one I don't think it's just what
where I am in my life I just feel like I
just don't need it all and the reality
is because of my job here on YouTube I'm
always gonna get more coming in I'm
always gonna buy more things so just
because I'm declutter Indust means I'm
making room so I can review other stuff
you know what I'm saying so now that
you've listened to all my tips let's go
ahead and get into the actual declutter
okay so today we're gonna do clutter all
of my blush so I'm going to set
everything out so you can see it
honestly my organization in my Alex
drawers has been terrible lately and I
can't find like a good solution I feel
like so after I do all this I'm really
excited to reorganize it and possibly
just have more space for things cuz
is way too much blush so let's go ahead
and do it
okay so this is my entire blush
collection I think I've got everything
so I feel like I have a lot of palettes
which I really don't use very often and
a lot of similar colors and I'm always
so torn because I love all of these but
the problem is I just don't need all of
them and they're I mean a lot of them
are powders they probably won't go bad
any time soon but even still there's no
point in me holding on to it for three
years and then eventually getting rid of
it so I'd rather get rid of it while
it's semi fresh and new so that someone
I know can use it a lot of times I'll
take my leftover makeup first I take it
to my family I've got three sisters and
my mom and I've got sisters-in-law on
but I also take it to work so that the
other teachers I work with can go
through it so it goes to good homes
sometimes if it's something I spent a
lot of money on I might sell it on
Poshmark from time to time so I'll list
my Poshmark shop below in case you are
curious but yeah so let's go ahead and
get into this so let's start over here
with these pallets these are these city
color intense blush palettes and this
one is in well I don't know does it
really not say it just says intense
blush palette but these are like kind of
more peachy toned colors and orange you
can tell they're very pigmented let me
swatch like this one but you can tell I
haven't even swatched all of these I
knew right off the bat that these were
not colors you know they're really
powdery that I would necessarily wear
all the time
so I didn't feel the need to even swatch
them now there are like these top three
colors I probably really would wear
that's kind of more bronzer II that's
actually really light um but like
especially that peach shade there I
probably really would wear that but will
I wear it enough to keep this entire
palette no I mean I've got to be real
with myself no way so this is one that
I'm going to pass on so this is
to see that powder got everywhere that
wasn't crazy this is the one that's more
like cool toned and this is one I was
even more drawn to but again I hadn't
swatched it yet because I thought well I
don't know if I'm going to use it so but
I want to swatch it for you guys
these actually are much more my cup of
tea when it comes to blush colors
they're just I like cool toned pink
blushes but again well I use this enough
I've got plenty like look this one here
it's just like that one oh my gosh like
dead-on
so do I really need a whole palette no
so I think I will pass it on if you
haven't watched my d clutters I'm
actually decently cutthroat when it
comes to this stuff this these a lot of
these are new I last time I did my whole
declutter series I got rid of a lot and
then I did another declutter where I got
rid of even more like 70% of my
collection because I just realized hey I
get new stuff in all the time whether
I'm buying it or it's being sent to me
and I also just I like getting rid of
and getting new it's kind of refreshing
so all the things I get rid of are going
to go over here by the way this is the
also the city color cosmetics timeless
beauty palette now this one I liked a
lot more because the packaging was
really you know heavy duty and nice this
is a gorgeous palette it has four matte
blush shades and then three highlighter
shades I actually have used this a bit
now the highlighters I mean they're not
I guess they're not really highlighters
they're more like either blush stoppers
or almost eyeshadows because they're
pretty deep for my skin tone now these
could probably be highlights for people
that just have much deeper skin tones
than me but they're gorgeous gorgeous
but they're absolutely gorgeous and the
blushes themselves are also really
pretty and it kind of took like my
favorite ones out of those other
palettes I'm getting rid of and put them
all in one so okay that was not a great
swatch but they really are nicely
pigmented I was very impressed with this
one and again the packaging is like
heavy and nice and gold yeah it does
list the those three as highlighters but
they wouldn't you'd have to have a
deeper skin tone so I think even though
I do like all of this I'm I
still get rid of it because in the two
months I've owned it I've used it like
twice and I would love it if these were
highlighters I could use but it's
they're just not so I think I am gonna
pass this on whoa three whole pallets
down that's not bad I'm still drinking
my coffee it's early in the morning okay
it's not early it's like noon but it
might as well be early it's summer break
all right my benefit powders these kill
me because I love all of them and I
really do and it's one of the few things
I own a lot of from one brand because I
genuinely love their blushes
one that I know I would never get rid of
is Dallas and I was giggling because I
watched declutter videos all the time
and someone was recently talking about
this and they were like you know I never
use it I'm like oh my gosh I literally
can't stop using it and it's been like
over a year now it does not look like
anything when you swatch it it kind of
looks like but it is so beautiful on the
cheeks I just I never would have thought
I would love this as much as I do but I
cannot stop using it and I'm I don't
know I can't describe it so that's one
I'm definitely keeping maybe I'll keep
the keeps up there and then get rid of
us back here um now the rest of these
hervana I love I think it's just a
really pretty like kind of mixed pink
color but every time I use it I feel
like I like it less and less because
it's kind of too light for me so this
one might be one that I actually sell
just because you know these are decently
priced and I bought all of them with my
own money so I never feel bad about
doing that so I think I am gonna get rid
of that even though I never thought I
would have said that and it kind of
breaks my heart
but I don't need it I just don't need it
you guys um and this is where I mean I
really am cutthroat because you have to
talk yourself you can't talk yourself
out of getting rid of it if you have
that feeling like you probably should
then you probably just should sugar bomb
I just is this one I actually did like
it's kind of peachy but again I think
it's too light for me even looking on my
hand it's just kind of I don't know like
frosty so I think I'm gonna get rid of
that one I cannot believe that coralista
now this is a peach color and it's a
little bit more
they are kind of powdered I've never
really noticed that this one's a little
bit more like it would look correct on
my cheeks you know what I mean
so I think I am going to keep coralista
dandelion might be another one that it's
just too pink for me like to light that
is yeah so I'm just gonna get rid of it
I can't believe I'm getting rid of these
first of all I am proud I'm only keeping
two things so far
and I'm getting rid of all of those go
Jessica coffee break anyone else when I
just said coffee breaks take coffee
break with me whoo I love Danny okay
let's go here so this is the pixi by
petra beauty blush duo and peach honey
now I pretty recently got this and it
really is more of a highlighter now if
you mix the two even still mixing I'm
trying to get more of that it's it's
just so frosty it really is more of a
highlighter it just is um let me get
just this side yeah it's not kind of got
to get a lot this side seems way more
pigmented than the other um I don't know
I feel like I haven't really tried this
enough to really decide what I want to
do with it so maybe I'll keep it um this
one it looks so beat up that's crazy but
I just got it why does it look so crazy
I wish you guys could see it looks like
dirty and which is insane because it's
one of my newest blushes I used to have
a pink one of this I don't remember
exactly what it's called but I bought
this coral on because somebody mentioned
it in a video and I was like ooh and go
to god I've got to get this really is a
beautiful peach shade it's right there
it is a little bit lighter but not too
light in fact see this makes me doubt if
I should keep coralista so right now I'm
torn because I feel like these are both
similar um let me swatch them both the
coralista and this coral looks like the
coral one from Maybelline might be
that's the one from Maybelline okay
coralista really is splotchy
and I think it would go on better with a
brush and that might be part of it but
it's just kind of odd I've never really
noticed it um I might just get rid of
coralista as well I know that's like
crazy but I loved them for a long time I
kept them for a long time but I think
it's just time so then I'm going to keep
this one do you see these seem similar
now let's watch those compared and see
which one I like better wow those are
almost identical you know what then I
think I actually like look how smooth
the pixi one went on compared to that so
I think I'm going to keep the pixie and
get rid of that one whoa I am killing it
this is amazing I'm only keeping two so
far and I know for sure that I love this
one in this one eye so far I really like
the best out of those all right next one
Sonia Kashuk this is another recent
purchase it's called flushed and their
blushes are crazy pigmented but I feel
like I haven't even gotten to use this
because I've had so many blushes so I
don't know that I'm going to love that
color it's really really bright but I
think even still I'm going to keep this
because I literally have only worn it
once so I've got to try that one out
this next one is from makeup geek and
it's in the shade xoxo and this one's
very new to me I think we got it in a
boxy charm and it is very very very
pigmented and much darker than I would
typically wear it looks kind of similar
to the Sonia Kashuk one doesn't it but
the Sonia Kashuk one really is a lot
Pinker pink her yeah so makeup geek
blushes just are really really good
their new packaging is beautiful I'm
going to keep both of those this next
one is boots number seven blush in soft
damson I've talked about this in
favorites a lot but it's already and
this is what's weird to me it's already
getting this like I love the color
though it's so like understanding kind
of a muted berry color but it's already
getting that like those the weird little
dots throughout it and that makes me
think mmm if I'm going to keep this I
feel like I should get a new one because
that always just grosses me out
it could
nothing but sometimes it could be other
things I really haven't done a lot of
research by way that but usually one
gets that point I start to think maybe
this has been sitting in the store for a
while and it's already old so I think
I'm going to get rid of this one and
then I might repurchase it because I do
I've talked about this a lot I love this
blush it stays on all day it's a
beautiful color
alright Milani
illuminating face powder I love this
people I remember used to talk about
it's not very pigmented but for some
reason and it really isn't like when you
swatch it it's like nothing like nothing
shows up but when you put it on with a
brush it just looks so gorgeous I if I
remember I brought this to Disney with
me for two weeks and I loved wearing it
because it was just the right amount of
color and like shimmer it was just
perfect so for me I loved it I think if
you do have a deeper skin tone you just
wouldn't like it it really wouldn't show
up but mine must be just in that right
zone for this shade so I ended up loving
that I love this blush this is from quo
a lovely subscriber sent this to me and
I was so impressed it's in the shade
pinched and it's just this perfect oh my
gosh like so smooth so perfect just this
kind of peach shade so I'm definitely
going to keep that one
this is another favorite this is from
City color it's their be matte blush in
blackberry they sent me their whole line
and when I get entire lines of things
from companies I eventually get rid of
most of it except for what I would wear
once I've maybe done a video or whether
I just decided I didn't want to because
there's no point in me keeping every
color but I just love first of all the
formulas amazing but this color was just
my favorite kind of reminds me of that
first one from number 7 here on my hand
but even more pigmented so this is like
an ultimate favorite of mine I'm gonna
kind of separate these out so you can
see like what I'm getting rid of them
when I'm this is awesome okay so this
one is from cargo
it's one of their full-size blushes in
Bali and their blushes these okay I
can't get it open
yeah these are water-resistant but the
only thing I don't like about this cut
the color is beautiful but it has this
Sheen
to it that's just kind of like got a
blueshift
and I just don't like it I don't really
know how else to describe it it's a very
odd like I ordered it online not knowing
but it has that shift to it that I just
don't like so I'm gonna get rid of it I
do want to get another one of these one
of their water-resistant ones just in a
different color so that's kind of on my
radar if there any sales and if you like
these blushes and you know of a shade I
would probably like let me know this one
is from NYX it's one of their HD blushes
in nude tude I've had this one for a
while like a year or so um it's just
kind of nothing I think I'm gonna get
rid of it I like the NYX HD blushes they
can be kind of powdery but some of my
favorite blushes are powder and if you
tap your brush off it's not that big of
a deal but this is just kind of a
nothing color at this point I used to
like it a lot but I kind of have
realized it doesn't always make my
cheeks look the best you know what I
mean so it's just time alright this one
I just bought I haven't even if I've
uploaded the Sephora haul where I bought
this I'll link it below but this is an
hourglass blush ambient lighting blush
and mood exposure
I really wasn't drawn to any of the
other ones this was the only one and
again it kind of looks like nothing but
when you put it on your cheeks it just
it's kind of like this where I mean this
is way more pigmented but where they
kind of to have just the right amount of
color and like that illuminating quality
it doesn't look glittery though it just
looks gorgeous so love love that this
one I used to have all three of these
but I got rid of all of them but the one
I loved loved a while ago cuz I have
gotten rid of a lot of makeup without
showing you on video just cuz you get in
a mood where I'm like I don't
necessarily have time to film it but I
need to get rid of stuff so anyway this
is in the princess daiquiris it's the
wet and wild ombre blushes and this is
just so pretty again it is kind of
lighter so if you have a deeper skin
tone it wouldn't work but it just ends
up looking so gorgeous on the cheeks so
this is a definite keep this is very
dirty this is the NARS one and deep
throat and their blushes are amazing
they really I mean they really are and
this one is no different
it is a little bit I think deep for my
skin tone when I apply this with a brush
it's never an issue so I really do like
this shade this one is from Kiko I
bought when I was in London it's their
soft touch blush in 109 and it's just a
very basic light pink color it's matte
which is nice because I feel like
sometimes it's hard to find matte blush
colors I don't know this is just so
basic I feel like do I even need it in
my collection I guess is the difference
but it is really nice I'm going to think
about that one this one I just got in an
Ipsy bag Sarafine botanicals I can open
it it's a really small blush but it's in
happy hibiscus it's a really soft touch
and it's very much like brown toned but
I haven't worn it yet and I want to try
it so I don't know if I'll get rid of
this one it might not be quite right for
my skin tone but I still want to try it
next this NYX cream blush I just bought
it's in the shade natural and I love it
you guys these they're cream blushes are
my favourite and I really don't like
cream blush but this one once you get it
on it's so creamy it's so it just stays
put I've never had a cream blush that
actually like stays in place and I think
the color is so beautiful so I want to
buy more of these cream blushes but I
really don't need to because I don't
need them any cream blushes but this
shade natural is my favorite I've had
boho-chic as well but I think this one
looks a little bit better with my skin
tone um
this is an elf total face palette and
out of all of the elf blush things that
I've tried and now that I'm thinking
about I feel like I have some that I
that are somewhere and I don't know I
don't know this is actually one of my
favorites because the bronzer is
actually really really perfect for my
skin Hey oh gosh it really is and then
these two blush colors are just gorgeous
wrong finger
there we go pink peach that pink one I
didn't
like the wrong finger um and then the
highlight if I remember right is
actually pretty nice
- oh no it's kind of more subtle it
actually is kind of a gray tone to it
now that I'm looking at it closer like a
legitimately gray color can you guys see
that that's insane
but I actually really like it now do I
need it probably not so this might be
one I don't know but I out of the elf
products it's one of my favorite and I
like to do elf videos so this is one I'm
going to think about as well so my think
about pile is this this I'm still going
to think about that one - these are
definite I'm going to think about the
Kiko one - you know what if I have to
think about it I'm getting rid of them
boom problem solved and I'm seeing now
this is their illuminating palette so
I'm going to save this for the
highlighter video so out of all of my
blushes I'm keeping two four six eight
ten and I'm getting rid of two four six
eight ten twelve fourteen fifteen so way
more than half of my collection I'm
getting rid of so that is amazing so you
can see here as I spread it out this is
everything I'm getting rid of this is
what I'm keeping so I think as I look
through always like to look back at my
keep I'll make sure there's nothing else
I'm having any reservations about
keeping and out of all of those I'm
going to just let other people go
through the rest and these five I'm
going to sell eventually on my Poshmark
so it's the four benefit blushes in the
cargo blush so this is my entire blush
collection hopefully you enjoyed that I
do feel proud of how much I got rid of
I'll be doing this as a series as I said
and my next one is highlighters and then
bronzers and then I'm looking
then I've got palettes single eyeshadows
primers foundations concealers mascaras
and liners and brow lipsticks lip
glosses lip balms I mean I've got it all
it'll end up being I think 11 videos
based on the way I had filmed it so
there's a long haul but I'm so excited
it was so much fun to do and it's such
an amazing feeling so if you are
interested stay tuned once I've got
these next video
up i'll start linking the playlist below
