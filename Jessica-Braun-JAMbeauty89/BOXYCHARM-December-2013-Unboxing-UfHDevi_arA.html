another subscription box so many and
actually I'm filming two different
videos because it's subscription boxes
are really big right now
that is no secret obviously and there
are just it's almost like there's so
many it's like where do you even begin
there the obvious like ones that have
been around for a while but there are
other ones that come out that are really
kind of different or interesting and
they might cost a little more but they
kind of offer something different so one
of the ones that feature today is
boxycharm and it comes in an adorable
box like this and this one is twenty one
dollars a month however it comes with
more so it kind of makes sense it pretty
much it comes with five to seven
products some are full-size for the most
part and I gotta get this little cute
ribbon it really is adorable it might be
the cutest box out of all of them and of
course I'll have links below or a link
for it so the theme for this month
December was winter wonderland how
appropriate I'm looking outside at the
winter wonderland that is my yard so and
it also of course has some like little
things for some of the brands that are
featured in the months this month's box
okay first of all this is adorable look
at this got a little like things in blue
I'm calling out okay so one of the first
things here on top is this connoisseur
it soothing facial mask and it feels
like there's oh it's like an actual mask
it's not like a thing it's like an
actual I've never tried one of these so
I'm actually really excited to try this
um it says it balances for glowing silky
skin heightens moisture relaxes and
firms and contains organic ingredients
which is always nice it's a mask that
you put it on and you leave it on for
like 15 to 20 minutes so I mean I try
that cuz I've never tried any actual
like formed masks before so that'll be
really nice especially in the winter
okay another thing this is a brand that
they it's actually funny Novak's they
said they were gonna send me something
then they never did so I'm like okay but
it came in this so that works well it's
I think it's a Brazilian brand says it's
Brazilian keratin no Vexen is there
extra deep haircare cream and my friend
Alexandra I think has tried out some of
the products I think she said she liked
them so I'm really excited it actually
seems like a pretty nice size and
especially you don't you probably don't
need that much for your hair so whoa it
says you're gonna leave it on for 25
minutes what that just seems crazy but
you know what if it's awesome then it
that would be worth it so I'll have to
try to let you guys know how I like it
and other things Wow there really is a
lot in there actually okay so this is
fun cuz there's a lot of brands I've
never heard of that I'm getting to try
so that's always nice this is the Ofra
Oro for a brand ofr a lip gloss and it's
in oh it's a lip gloss plumper oh and
it's in the shade sultry and it's like
this really deep like berry color which
again perfect for winter I love the
theme because so far all of these kind
of fit in with like moisturizing your
hair and moisturizing your skin deeper
colored lips so I'm really excited it
looks like it's like the applicator is
just like a normal lip gloss applicator
let me swatch it if I can get it out ooh
this is a really pretty color it really
is perfect for winter you guys you're
gonna be proud of me I actually
remembered to get something to wipe off
swatches this is like the first time in
history yeah I don't have to be so dirty
the whole time okay another thing they
sent is this mission brand lip balm and
it's in sweet vanilla which come on one
you know I'm gonna love that I'm not
gonna open it cuz I don't wanna open
until me to use it but it's got SPF and
it says ten vitamins and antioxidants
locks and moisture for up to eight hours
that sounds awesome
and it says field-tested by Gretchen
Bleiler is that like someone favorite
you can't see that what am I talking
about
anyway I'm excited cuz I love lip balm
so I love check them out so this is
awesome okay it came with a nail polish
- loriell oh my gosh this looks gorgeous
it's in the shade very nice look at the
color it's really really pretty
it's not dang it it is not showing up at
all it's like a really deep but like
purpley purple it's really cool it's not
showing up at all this stinks but it
looks gorgeous and like I said it's in
the shade berry nice perfect for this
time of year okay two more things how
many one two three four five
come on one two three four five six yeah
seven items that's I mean that's pretty
awesome
it's the Mirabella brand and let's see
what it is it's a gel mascara looks like
it's full-size it's their lash essential
mascara get it out of Cal oh I'm diggin
that it's like real long and thin so it
takes I love I kind of love when
mascaras are like a different shape than
normal so it's really really thin and
really really long whoo which is really
cool I don't want to get air in it so I
can't look at the brush I know that's
terrible but I have so many mascaras
open I can't if I open another one I'm
gonna be in trouble with myself I'm
serious anyway okay and the last thing
is this NYX eyeshadow it's a trio look
at those colors I don't know that these
are colors that I would wear but I mean
that's it I will have the NYX eyeshadows
I really do I really really do looks
like well it looks like got a little
smashed in packaging I'm gonna swatch it
though because these are oh my gosh Nick
shadows are so luxurious I just love
them look at those oh my gosh this one I
would wear look at that oh my gosh I
love that so that box came with like I
said seven products all of them are
full-size I don't know will like what
the full size of this no Beck's hair
conditioner is but that's a pretty solid
size and then the mass so really
everything was full size and for 21
bucks that's really not bad so I'll link
that below I would be very interested to
see what next month's would be because
this is only one month's and I know that
with some things like Birchbox that I've
tried one month will be great and then
the next month will be terrible so I
would be very interested to see what
next month's would be but I will put the
link down below because I mean the box
is adorable it comes with a lot of
products all of those are full-size so
I think that's pretty awesome so anyway
I hope that was helpful for you guys in
your search for subscription boxes that
are worth it and I look at you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
