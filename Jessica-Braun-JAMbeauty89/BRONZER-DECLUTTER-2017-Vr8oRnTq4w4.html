kits where it might have other stuff in
it so it's maybe a duo-trio quad etc
figured I would throw them into this one
because I have less bronzers when I do
highlighters and blush so all clothes
these I just wanted to show the inside
if you haven't seen Ida clutters before
I like to be as ruthless as possible
because I do get a lot of these things
sent to me and so if I didn't be clutter
twice a year all of my collection I
would just have too much and obviously
that is an awesome problem to have I'm
not complaining about that I love that
part of my job and my hobby here on
YouTube but at the same time it can be
very overwhelming so it really is nice
to just go through and really think
about what am i loving what am i using
and what am i not and really just
weeding those things out so as I
mentioned I like to look at my whole
collection and think okay if I were
shopping and all of these are in front
of me what would I buy again I love so
much that I would buy again so first
thing that stands out is this Chanel
bronzer it's one of those that it was so
hyped for years and I was like that's so
dumb why do people love it and then I
tried it I'm like oh my gosh I literally
use it every single day I love it now I
have a dupe for you right off the bat so
I'm definitely gonna keep this I'm
definitely keeping the dupe it's
actually an elf product and it's a duo
of theirs and it's like they're like
water aqua infused line and it's the
cream but this bronzer is the palette is
called bronzed pink beige and this
bronzer right here it's like a cream to
powder kind of feel to it is let me
swatch that so that's the elf one right
this Chanel want they are like the exact
same product now this Chanel one is
maybe a little bit creamier and they're
not exactly the same shade but they are
really really close and they look the
same on the skin they stay the same
amount of time they give the same effect
where you want to look bronze but you
want to look healthy you don't want to
look like it's a bunch of powder
everywhere and that is why I think
people love this that's why I love it
but this elf one is just as amazing so
if you're looking to get something or
maybe you're thinking about getting that
Chanel one but you want to try it first
just try the elf one honestly you
probably won't even buy this you know
who the elf is really good I just wish
that they sold this duo with as well as
not adieu I wish they just sold that
single pan really big that would be me
so what else would I repurchase right
away I would repurchase the butter
bronzer again and again it is so nice I
have the one that's the light bronzer
smells like coconuts it's just such a
natural bronzy color on my skin so you
can't even see it when I swatch it it is
so incredible packaging is fun I broke
this little thing though so that drives
me nuts but doesn't really matter but it
still drives me nuts but I'm definitely
picking up the NARS Laguna bronzer I
really I do like and I will say I used
to have the duo and I got rid of it
because I liked just having a big
bronzer because I usually use a bigger
brush I like to just be able to swirl it
all in whereas when it's those duos I'm
so less likely to use it that's kind of
what I've learned about myself so love
this definitely keeping it another one
that I love is this elf contour palette
I talked about it my best and worst of
elf for this year for 2017 I it's just
an amazing palette it's not shimmery at
all there's not really any glitter to it
it's just a really great palette for a
natural contour natural bronze you know
highlight under your eyes set your under
eye power etc it's just so so great I
love it so definitely keeping that say
Jim one that I think I'm getting rid of
now that I have filled that elf video is
this duo I really like it it's a great
like I've learned this blush recently it
does pick up a lot of power to the the
bronzer is good too but I feel like I
just never use them so I don't know I
think I'm going to pass them on just
because they're just getting lost in my
collection they're not bad at all so in
fact they're really good but they're
just not going to use some of the pass
it on to someone that won't so now let's
just kind of go through one by one
because I feel like now I'm at the point
where all of this is stuff that I really
do like but it's not necessarily
something I would go buy right now so I
want to see whether or not I should keep
it or not so let's start here this is
the it cosmetics genifique waa quad love
the huge mirror I like to actually
travel with this for that mirror alone
but it really is an amazing product
again because I have so much I am never
using this and I want to use it because
it is all four of these powders are so
good so the only thing I'll say is I
feel like the bronzer it will swatch
okay but I feel like it doesn't actually
show up when you apply it with a brush
so I don't know what that's about I want
to investigate it also shows
fingerprints like crazy
but I'm going to keep this I want to
actually use it now this is one from
Salma Hayek's line called nuance like
that's the makeup brand I don't know I
just have no desire it's a it's a
classic duo where the pink is way too
bright for me the bronzer is okay I
think I'm just going to pass it on
I don't like there's no delineation
between the two I don't like that
they're right next to each other like
that again that's my own personal
preference but I'm going to pass that on
this sweet peach glow I just got so I
want to try out some more it's I was
pretty impressed with the highlight here
it's like incredible course it smells
like peaches this blush is gorgeous this
is kind of a bronzey shave it really is
more like a highlight let me just kind
of swatch it there there you go it's
pretty again I just haven't gotten any
use out of cuz I just got it so these
are Rimmel ones I think I'm going to
pass on I might keep one just for
reference but even still I said they
weren't bad but they didn't Wow me I
like that they opened this way I don't
know why that is like exciting to me but
I was thinking it was open that way and
I wasn't but I love that it opens that
way if I were to keep one or even
recommend one this one's a little bit
too light for me and I have pretty fair
skin I like the blush actually but this
bronzer is way too light so in kind of I
don't know like orangie and patchy so
this is one I pass on this is the one in
golden sands so that's an easy one to
say goodbye to this one's a little too
dark for me very chocolatey bronzer look
beautiful on some people with a deeper
skin tone but much too dark for me this
one's in golden bronze so I'll pass back
this one is in coral glow and it's about
the only one that was just right it's
like the Goldilocks effect effect but it
doesn't really do much the blush was
nice but again nothing I can't already
find it's kind of fluorescent II and I
didn't love that I'm just going to pass
it on moving on this is my Marc Jacobs
duo in Mirage filter I do like this
again it keeps getting lost of my
collection because I have too much so I
need to wipe off my swatches just a
really simple contour and not a high
but light well kind of but I totally mat
one so it's great for setting your
under-eye and it's got that kind of
yellow tone like a banana powder so I do
like this which it works oh darn big
though this is an easy one to get rid of
it's the it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination which is my
favorite powder foundation but it's a
really deep color and so I put it in my
bronzers but it doesn't quite look right
it's just not quite right as a bronzer
so I'm going to pass it on to someone
that will actually use it
I'm going to pass this elf baked bronzer
on I talked about it my ELF s and worse
it just doesn't really do much it's a
little bit too shimmery kind of got this
hard pan on top so it's just going to go
this one is well way too shimmery the
Rimmel natural bronzer but it's in
number zero 20 sunshine and it's so so
shiny in like light and just not quite
right so I want to pass that one on okay
good Jeff now you're getting rid of a
lot go girl go there all right
this Sigma 1 I'm going to also pass on
it's called in the saddle or a powder
and I don't know I'm just it's a little
bit too deep for me I don't need
anything that wrong so that one's going
to go it's not a bad product just not
the right shade this pure is it no this
is the SA edit I like this it has like a
splatter of like the shimmer to it at
one point but I liked it it was a little
bit lighter of a shade I can actually
use it as my skin tone so I actually
will keep that one this hourglass one
I'll hop and I have gone through so many
I have so many hourglass products and
this is one that I get so excited when I
see I love the fake marble
I heard someone complaining about the
packaging that I'm like what like it's
not going to be real marble like that
would just be insane and I just thought
it I thought I think it is the cutest
cutest packaging and it doesn't feel
fingerprints like all of their other
products do like I have my trio right
here and those fingerprints they're not
coming off like I swear it's just always
a mess and so I love this new packaging
but I liked it it's got some kind of
highlighting one some kind of bronze or
shades and then some blushes I usually
just mix them all together honestly
they're just really pretty
finally no powders comfortable to wear
kind of foolproof and I just love it and
it's got a nice big mirror so I'm
definitely keeping that these byte multi
sticks I'm going to pass on these are
bronzer shades they sent these to me a
while ago I just don't ever use them
this one's in blondie and again if you
had a deeper skin tone or if you really
like these kinds of products you like
them because they're not bad this was in
cocoa they're really really pigmented
you're you can wear them anywhere that's
why they're called multi Stix
but they're ones that you know I'm just
not never using those colors so it's
just time these two two-faced ones I has
a milk chocolate Soleil and I have the
chocolate Soleil in the light they
almost look the same and you can kind of
see me this is just a hair deeper but
it's hardly deeper so I'm thinking I
might get rid of the milk chocolate
Soleil because it's really I mean it's
all too light you know what I mean like
it's really not it's almost just like a
regular face powder well almost like a
regular face powder for me I love the
idea behind it though because there are
so many bronzers that are way too dark
for super fair so I like the idea behind
it but I'm going to pass that one on and
I think I'll just keep the regular
chocolate Soleil then I've got my Kevin
Kwan sculpting powder and mediums the
second one I've had of this I'm ever
really truly wanting to contour which I
don't do very often but for when I do
this is the one that I reach for more
than anything so that's a definite
keeper there's a reason I've had more
than one of those last two this is the
Too Faced one and sweethearts bronzer I
just I don't know I keep trying to force
myself to use this and it never looks
great on my skin it does have a shimmer
to it which I don't hate but parallel it
just never looked right I mean so I'm
going to pass that one on and then last
thing is this pure one which I love so
much it's just the perfect tone you can
just get the matte part which is what I
usually do or you can get the shimmery
part or you can mix them and I just I
just think this is such an amazing
bronzer it's called Glo together I love
it so here is everything I'm keeping and
then this delineates this is what I'm
getting rid of I think let's see three
six nine ten eleven twelve thirteen on
getting rid of and four five six seven
9 10 11 12 13 13 to 13 that's so crazy
in my blush one I got rid of 15 glasses
and kept 15 so it's just funny I've
gotten rid of exactly half of my bronzer
/ like trios duo's etcetera so I think
that's pretty good these are all ones
it's looking at what I'm keeping these
are all ones but make me happy that I
look at and I think yes like I could use
any one of those any day and I would be
happy whereas these are ones that are
either kind of like ah or when I look at
it it doesn't just bring me joy so it's
just time to get rid of so I feel very
good about this declutter very good my
highlighting one I got rid of a good
amount but not quite half so I'm really
glad to be back on the 50% wagon here so
if you enjoyed this to clutter
definitely check out my other ones that
I have on my channel I've got millions
and trillions okay that is an
exaggeration but I have a lot so I will
link that playlist below I hope you'll
subscribe so that you can see all of my
future ones I've got a lot coming up and
I'm constantly in a state of deep
lettering so just I would say probably
twice a year and a decline in my whole
collection just because I do get so much
in both from buying them to review and
also just from companies so hopefully
