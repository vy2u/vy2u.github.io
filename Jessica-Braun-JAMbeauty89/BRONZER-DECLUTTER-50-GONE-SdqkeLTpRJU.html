which we're going to declutter today and
I'm going to set them out as I usually
do so you can see them all and then
we'll go through them one by one so
these are all of my bronzers I have 2 4
6 7 9 10 12 14 16 18 20 21 bronzers /
contour type products so let's just
start over here as I usually do so these
are the wet and wild contouring palettes
I've already done a review of these I'll
link below I really did like them and
that I mean you'll see in the video I
was very impressed with these they redid
the formula and I think the new formula
is even better it's certainly smoother
and more pigmented but I'm finding
myself not use it very often this is
actually in my opinion a pretty close
dupe to this one actually I would say
like if you combined this bronzer which
this is the one in dulce de leche with
this highlighting color which is in
caramel toffee you would get this so
that I have the dupe video for those I
can link below because this is like 50
something dollars and these are like 5
so I was very impressed with these do I
need to keep them when I've already
spent the money on this not really so I
feel like it's just kind of taken at
room just because because I spent a lot
of money on this I feel like I should
use this and get my money's worth and
since I love both I don't think it
really matters which I keep so I'm gonna
get rid of those this is a two-faced
Sweethearts bronzer in sweet tea and I
thought I wouldn't like this and I
actually love it
it's just such a perfect summer like
light nice semi shimmery bronzer that
just look makes your skin look healthy
and I I've had a sweethearts like blush
that I it was okay so I was like well
this will just be okay I actually really
liked it so this is definitely a keep
for me alright all my two-faced ones
let's flip the
so I can see the names let's start with
one of my strategies and ID clutters
from time to time especially when I'm
decluttering on my own is okay let's
look at this what do I know I want to
keep so that's one way I've tried to
declutter and I think I'm I feel like
I'm more successful when I do it that
way so looking at these what I know I
want to keep is the chocolate Soleil
bronzer this one is their classic
bronzer it's just the perfect there it's
matte but it's just the perfect for me
color to bronze up my face without it
being too much because I'm keeping the
regular chocolate soleil bronzer I can
get rid of the milk chocolate because
it's just a little bit too light I
thought that would be perfect for me but
it really is much lighter and I'll show
you these kind of side by side so this
is the chocolate they look pretty close
but the regular chocolate really is
better for me so I'm gonna get rid of
the milk chocolate the dark chocolate
Soleil is much deeper and much warmer
and I think for me I don't need that so
I'm gonna get rid of that one go Jessica
go now we've got a bunch of the bunny
bronzers actually before we do that
let's do the pink leopard this one it's
just the one I actually really liked and
wanted to keep might have been I
remember thinking yeah it's such a weird
and cool color it's kind of like a I
don't even know how to describe it but I
feel like I should put this in with my
blush and not necessarily in with my
bronzers because it really is like a
pink tone so let me think about this one
first let me look at the bunnies so this
one is beach bunny
this one is snow bunny and this one is
Sun bunny I feel like these two the
beach bunny and the Sun bunny are pretty
similar yeah and neither one of those
are really that up my alley let me do
this sweet tea one again to compare them
since I know I like that yeah so these
two are much warmer okay this one has
more of a red tone so I'm gonna get rid
of this is the one in Sun bunny and so I
know I'm not a big fan of that this
one's kind of borderline as well let's
swatch snow
and see see these are all that one's a
little bit lighter but I don't really
get this because you know it's got these
pretty colors in it but it really just
swatches out - I'm trying to like clean
it up
it really just swatches out into a
bronze color so it's never really made
sense to me at all to be honest but
they're pretty but I think I'm gonna get
rid of snow bunny and honestly I might
get rid of beach bunny - I don't think I
need all of them you know let me see oh
that's the chocolate Soleil what was
this one pink leopard I really do think
that's pretty I think I'm gonna keep it
but I'm gonna put it with my blush after
this video so so far I'm keeping three
blushes right here can you guys see them
yes yep and I'm getting rid of one two
three four five six seven of them that's
awesome
butter bronzer I love I'm keeping its if
you haven't tried it you just have to
it's just this perfect you can barely
see it but when you put it on it looks
perfect just a light bronzer it smells
amazing it's so smooth and it's at the
drugstore like spread-eagle eing over
here but all right let's keep going I
have two of the Kevin OH Quan powders
and medium this one's almost gone I'm
gonna pass this on I've had this for so
long it's kind of getting that weird
feel to it which kind of grosses me out
it still looks okay but I don't want to
put it on my skin if it's gonna have
anything growing it you know what I mean
but this one's newer so I'm gonna keep
this one I just bought it
this is like one of the few splurge item
zyv repurchased because it's just an
amazing here let me actually show you a
real swatch just such a perfect contour
shade when you're doing a true like
shadow contour I just love it it's so
good so keeping that one getting rid of
this one I'll probably trash it this one
is from soap &amp;amp; Glory it's their Wonder
bronze now this I actually wear more as
a blush even though it is clearly like
gold and bronze E but if you put it on
actually looks really pretty on the
cheeks it's like almost a peach like
blush in a way so I am I need to clean
this up isn't
else like crazy about keeping their
makeup clean and a lot of this has
gotten so dirty because I've been so
like unorganized and so that's part of
the reason I was like I've got a
declutter I'm gonna keep this but again
this and what was that other one the
pink leopard I'm gonna end up putting
with my blush because I really do think
they're more blushy tones alright so
this is the NARS Laguna bronzer and I do
love this it's just a classic bronzer
kind of a satin finish not shimmery but
just satin and it's just a perfect shade
so I'm gonna keep that one this one this
is from the Estee edit and it had okay
so the Estee edit line it's cute because
there it's like a little more edgy and
you know the packaging is kind of fun
and weird but this bronzer had this like
gold I guess over spray like a splotch
obviously it was intentional but I don't
really get it well now it's almost gone
but the bronzer itself is actually
pretty good I don't know why I did two
swatches side-by-side but there we are
but I almost want to like get rid of all
of that weird splotch let's just get rid
of it
here we go most of it's gone now it is
actually a really pretty bronzer shade
what's the shade actually called it's
called the barest bronzer in
light/medium actually is nice now that
that's gone cuz that thing kind of
weirded me out cause I'm like well I
don't want that shimmer
let me think about this one because I
want to compare it to these this is this
pure minerals bronzer and glow together
and it's a matte - shimmer I'm gonna do
kind of both and then you can mix them
so that's the matte one that's the
shimmer one woah it's much deeper so
that's the matte that's the shimmer and
then if you kind of mix them all
together it's very you can see it's
almost like creamy powdery and then
mixed is right there oh of course now
it's like mixed with it um I love this
bronzer especially when you use a brush
because with your hand the oil is mixing
with it and because it's such a soft
formula it's it's watching really
heavily but it really is a beautiful
bronzer and I just
it's just a little bit different so I
know I want to keep that one and that
makes me think should I even keep this
one
it is really nice though and I feel I
just recently got it and I want to
actually give it a try so I think I am
going to keep it this though this is
from it cosmetics it's their sunshine in
a compact in warmth it's too warm for me
in my opinion I mean I can wear it it's
not that far off from these but I feel
like if I'm gonna keep the pure minerals
one I don't also need this so I am gonna
get rid of that one this is the Marc
Jacobs duo I told you guys about I'm
gonna keep it's their Mirage filter so
it's got like this contour type shade
and it's got a highlighting type shade
and they're just kind of perfect again
this is a really nice more true grey
contour and I really like it so keeping
that this is the elf contour palette
this is actually really good I love this
shade here and this is like a really
deep one but again it's still pretty
good for like a true contour II type
shade and then it's got this beautiful
light yellow again similar to this one
where you can highlight your under eye
whatever and then it also has a white
but the white has some shimmer to it
well I guess has more of like a satin
finish but these are amazing if you want
a matte highlight so I'm definitely
keeping that as well and then let me
kind of even this out a little bit this
is the it cosmetics use sculpted and I'm
kind of tired of contour palette I think
all of us are but I was so impressed
with this shade right here this soft
contour because it's it really is like a
genuinely soft contour but it has that
gray tone but now that I'm using it I'm
thinking it might be a little bit too
light for me so maybe I will pass this
on because I feel like when I use it for
the first time I didn't have as much Sun
as I do right now
and so it was like really cool because
it does have a great time but now it's
literally too light so I'm gonna pass it
on so these are all the things I'm
getting rid of these are all the things
that I am keeping 2 4 6 8 10 things I'm
getting rid of and at least 2 4 6 8
10:11 that I'm keeping so about 50% I
think that's pretty darn good and I I
don't feel bad and as I look at these
I'm like the only things I'm like about
are like these two look kind of similar
but I love them both so why not use them
both you know but yeah not bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
