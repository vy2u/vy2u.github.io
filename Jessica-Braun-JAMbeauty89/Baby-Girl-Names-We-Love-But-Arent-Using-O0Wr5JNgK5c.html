husband time and lime my lovely wife
anyway today we're gonna share with you
a bunch of baby names that we are not
going to use and at the very end I share
the one we're gonna use are we nope just
kidding joke's on you
I'm just like we are no you got to watch
all the way through nope at 40 you'll
find allies and soon enough now the
reality is whatever you're watching this
video we could have already had the baby
but of course at the time we're filming
this I am had what 39 weeks pregnant
just about we know that she's laughing
in there I could tell next time anyway
so we do know it's a girl and we do know
that of course we can have it any time
it's a baby and there's only one but we
have decided on the name so I was just
saying this is another video our next
door neighbor was telling me he's like
you know him and his wife had the whole
name picked out and then they had the
baby and they were so they're like it's
not right
ended up changing it so so you know see
right and the other tricky thing with
this is I thought if we had another kid
and it's a girl like we'll probably use
one of these names well yeah exactly so
oh well well tell you what to do any of
the guy names any of the boy names that
we just I almost think we save save save
save it
alright so Casper oh he's so ridiculous
Jonathan was the first one
my girls list hey that's not funny
because a lot of people do boy names
I knew it yeah actually I need a girl
going to school with her name was Jonah
and she was named after her uncle it was
a firefighter and died in a fire and so
anyway that's cool alright so we what we
had done originally is we flipped
through a whole thick book that my
sister had like she I need to get it
back to her anyway I'm like a big baby
name book in the middle and it was
called baby names and we could like sync
up and so when I got a match it would
let you up on earth save it save it
what is pretty good from see one of you
guys to me I want to tell us I feel like
it's definitely like Joe Mullaney no
it's not oh well they're from the office
safe maybe okay so anyway so we used the
app so we found some top in common but
then I remember one day we were sitting
this was a couple months ago in bed and
I said ok with all of our list of names
because we have this shared note on our
phone with all these names with all of
these names let's write down our top
five and then compare and see what we
have in common or something like yeah we
had promised do you remember that one no
I don't remember that I remember you
there are some that I know that we're
like I definitely want this but it's
kind of I mean common we've been
together for almost a decade we've
talked about this before just kind of
flippantly before we even had kids so
there was something like we knew we both
liked
already like Dumbo we were searching
dirt well he was no more Dumbo but then
like once it actually came we're like
now it's not it's just not right I'm not
feeling it okay so one no one that we
both loved was Aurora that's up above
yeah it's just such a beautiful name and
then that was her don't worry Amin for a
while yeah yeah
and then Rory for short we just thought
that was cute and of course Sleeping
Beauty is a part of that absolute
Gilmore Girls ain't get more girls one
that was really high on my list for a
long time it was high on mine too well
you know what I'm gonna say I think I
understand at the same time that was a
good one though that one was high and so
what I said was Fleur I we I just love
that name and you and I can totally see
us naming somebody that I know
that's pretty high up naming somebody
not our kid just name one somebody no no
I was saying Madeleine though that was
really high that's what everyone's guess
was like in our family who was it and my
parents thought it was gonna be that my
dad has really gal and he said you know
do not open this until your parents but
I guess he put a guess of what he thinks
the name is gonna be in there I bet he
thinks it's Madeleine because our only
hint to our family was that it has
something to do with Paris that's all we
said it's a deep Paris thing it's good
giving it away okay we're gonna know but
anyway I will say I don't know if I
should tell you do love that name I
don't know if I should say this but I
you might want to cut this out there are
two people I'd remember what video is on
some vlog or something on my channel who
commented to different people who got
the name right okay it may be you maybe
I took screenshots so eventually when we
reveal the names we can saw that you
were you could say this person you were
right this person you are right and I'm
chosen to be a billion guesses on this
video - it's fun though yeah okay
Anastacia that one was very high on my
list yeah hi Anastasia was on my top top
yeah oh my - I loved Anastasia I still
do I think that was only my top five
when we went through it did top 5 also
how did you guys decide on your baby
names like did you guys like you don't
have like before you started having kids
like did you know what you wanted to
name them and you were like hey honey
I've always wanted name my kid this or
did you do what we're doing like a
lottery kind of thing we're like we have
20 names we're like all right you pick
five I'll pick five see if any of them
match
I'm just curious but I'm gonna throw it
up I mean honestly maybe people did that
a good mixture say we really owe one
that I really liked Calliope
yeah which I don't know anyone named do
you wanna be Calliope but you were the
one who told me about that do you man
there was a song you sang from Jacques
Brel or something like that no that's a
very obscure reference that's awesome
Chuck Braille is alive and well and
living in Paris isn't that what it's
called that's called all three of you
didn't know what that is are freaking
out look oh my gosh there's such deep or
Jacques Brel is that a deep nervous
ference okay but yeah that made that
specific review or music and you saying
of something they had the word Calliope
ana which is just such a pretty word
Calliope you know what no it wasn't it
was carousel carousel carousel yeah I
wonder if that's a lyric in it I don't
think it is either way Calliope is it a
name of song there the name is carousel
so nervous oh where to clay because like
I'm telling you I don't think it's wrong
worried my whole life is gonna lie name
I really like his juniper and I thought
June for short I still like that name
she might be born in June no that's the
street but yeah I really liked that name
I just think it's such a pretty Juniper
fili and I like to feel young I think it
shakes
okay yeah I think of Shakespeare Hamlet
the character although she kills herself
in that either way I really here Tony
Hamlet Hamlet I do
olive you really like olive that was a
big one on your list so cute also I just
love olives I think it's so cute olives
Luna and you know who has the kid named
Luna John Legend and Chrissy Teigen
that's right and I do know that they're
John Legend's John Legend is amazing I
don't think it's that funny Krista T
gives hilarious yeah it's the combo of
that I think that's what's so funny but
yeah one of their kids are their kid
what I think they have only one either
way Luna is named but I just love that
name again anything like Spacey I think
is so pretty
yeah thanks Jarek Cassiopeia is when I
thought of I'm like now that's way too
long but also Luna Lovegood was a big
thing too because we always thought like
she was kind of an unsung hero in that
but she she ended up being like a hero
in some she's brave and she was a good
friend and she was there for and she
embraced her weirdness yeah she might
have been the best character and he was
awesome at first okay another one I love
personally is Estelle that's my mom's
middle name so that was one that I think
it's a beautiful name as it is but it's
even more so
because it's my mom's middle name so you
definitely see a style in the future
also I always think we're so Getti good
oh that's awesome simple and why did we
like simple because of Downton Abbey
because the characters simple again
oh she was breaking all the social norms
ah she was a good character she was so
good and that's the thing I want I want
I almost said her name to be so brave to
be so just like Shh oh girl I can do
anything
what that's why she already has her
little kid toolbox duh
we got they're helping me with a little
plastic hammer I think it's what but
that's why I'm like I'm so glad that we
live in this age now we're like Moana is
like out cuz I'm like I don't want her
to watch that all the time because she's
gonna be the bomb calm and she's gonna
be so cool the world the Pocahontas is
though oh that's true Kahana she's such
a she's awesome
she's even like Belle like that looks
cool and grew their way language thing
yeah like I don't know worries I just
love it I love all this sorry
look at this somebody just comments on
my youtube channel I didn't know that
you guys loved Harry Potter do you
obviously have not watched many of our
videos because I'm pretty sure there's
only a few that we do not mention how
much really fair I feel even Disney more
than that oh yeah that just overpowered
it um
Brigitte that one was like top three for
me still is Brigitte I think is such a
beautiful name Brigitte Braun that
sounds so pretty but um but you didn't
love it as much as I and I don't think
it was income the only thing that I
didn't like is I know somebody that I
don't necessarily like so much you think
she's watching this that would be
horrible
I highly doubt it her name was Bridget
and that's the only she is spelled
different but people are always that was
the other thing
oh yeah a big part of us deciding this
was the nicknames because people will
inevitably call them by a nickname
whether you say because like my best
friend Ben who I've known since I was
three years old for probably 10 years
his parents were like you need to call
him Benjamin and I was like I'm not
gonna do that
I'm gonna comb then and so all this
frames helm has been and all of his
family doesn't miss Benjamin so people
will just inevitably because I used to
call and be like hey it's been there
they were like no I was like oh where is
he
Benjamin is home but people always home
by a nickname so we're trying to think
of all the different nicknames that come
on yeah that was one thing and then what
we were just talking about those
brothers huh Brigitte oh well I was just
thinking of people we know with the
names like no that to me having taught I
had a big problem with so many names we
like to like know I know that students
that name they have that name I can't do
it I can't know we're like it just it
just reminds me that kids so it's like
right and I know if we really named her
that if you would do but it was still
hard
um we had Nick wants us to get creative
you know but there was a nickname and
then there was another thing that was a
big deciding factor that we started to
talk about and I already forget what we
were talking about what was welcome me
onto the nickname not liking someone I
don't know a good shirt can we show off
you do so when the great movie right
clothes we got in there when it closed
it's so good I'm still I get it I
actually have two full right throughs of
footage from two different times we
wrote it and I need to edit it all
together yeah because I remember I tried
to do like different size depending on
which way we were on so I need to like
edit that all together and put that up
because I just hey I'm just nostalgic
B I think people would want to see that
yeah I was probably a million videos
online already of that sure but it's
different cause it's it was from my
camera phone yeah
alright another name Amelie like the
movie but then we were like we hadn't
watched the movie in a while and I
always come back so you like me and I do
too but it's one of those things that
that like if you know that movie you're
gonna always think of that and I'm like
I don't want
I don't remember anything I literally
remember she didn't really like talking
it mom
my mom this is the second time today my
mom has texted us said hey how you
feeling well in all fairness yesterday
we went to the doctor and I'm like 90%
of faced in like couple Sunim
centimeters dilated so they're all like
mom I'll call you I promise I will call
you just excited they're so excited I'm
excited too yeah it's funny because your
mom has 16 grandchildren and my mom has
two and our kid is gonna be both of
their favorites which is just it's gonna
be great you're not biased
oh no she's gonna be the best you'll be
the coolest the coolest okay so we're
almost done
all right yeah I mean there's a couple
more as they all do is one actually this
was her original middle name
and we had like satellite yes she's
written it on so many pieces of paper
just to see what it looks like it I did
a bunch of times yeah I say oh yeah was
one and it was cuz this past Valentine's
Day Tyler got me cuz I love flowers but
like they died so quickly and so Tyler
brought me for Valentine's Day an actual
like plant and it was an azalea plant
and they were talked about in a blog you
can see him in the vlog the same in ones
that I bought we can link it below but
you have to tell me which vlog it is is
it in the picture that I don't know okay
any blogs on his channel if you didn't
know so anyway well comb through it but
and we were just I don't know what like
we're I don't know we were just like oh
my gosh that's a beautiful name and they
were like we put it with the first name
we're going with it sounds certainly
pretty nice yeah
but so we were set on that for probably
two months and then just this past week
we decided on a different middle name
that hasn't even stronger meaning behind
it again another Paris tie but yeah I'm
excited the azalea's died well and that
was another thing and so we were like we
were hoping it would like literary
complain in the back yeah I couldn't but
the problem was it was so cold for so
long there by the time cuz I could have
transplanted
yeah it was it just by the time it
actually was warm enough to plan it
outside it was so he thought that's
probably good when I pulled it out it
was definitely it was it was bound so it
definitely would have lived if it was
warmer outside um another name was
Willow I don't really remember that one
either I must have just typed that one
in I think I do the same with uniformly
yeah these I love I love the name I like
nature II inspired names I think they're
pretty Vivian have we talked about that
one yet
no we haven't Vivian that was a big one
Vivian Vance though I always think I
can't but I felt Vivian different you're
good ID and any at the end yeah it's
pretty it's pretty spelled this way
Vivian it's pretty both ways that yeah
definitely the baby or viv
Samson I'm happy with the name we're
going with yeah and we've already kind
of picked the nickname and I call her
that already more than her really but
the only thing good that way that's
what's that's it just that yeah we
that's what I was saying earlier but the
nicknames like we know people are gonna
call our nickname so we already have
like yeah so we're always like alright
we're good
this is gonna be your nickname we're
gonna call her that all the time kind of
like my brother's his daughter's name is
Emerson but they call her Emmy and they
told everybody before when I call her
give me so there's no other nickname so
her whole life she's already got the
nickname because there's another one
that you could go with possibly maybe
even two other nicknames everything we
have oh yeah but there's one that we
really like so we're like when when she
gets high school she's gonna I'm used to
my maiden name Murphy and like new
things I had Smurf Jai Smurf Sanford
therefore ding dong I'm sticking face up
TCB that's my initial theories like to
see Kirby oh my gosh
people are so creative Austin's nickname
my oldest brother it was like a bra so
hey bro so did you kid you're driving
you're not cool
dumb we all were in high school like I'd
be like so you guys go to Taco Bell like
go buzz the queue it's come on I got a
car yeah my us buzz the cute there's a
big thing
buzzing the queue you go you drive
around Dairy Queen whom I worked in
Philadelphia
I always totally Riley go rustic even
like is that an Indiana thing like yeah
dude was too cute maybe my gosh I hated
you I didn't even know I was a theater
geek and I'm like better than everyone I
was horrible everybody looks back and we
were all terrible I think I don't think
there's anybody looks back like it was
pretty cool nice oh so do you probably
still suck if you look back on your high
school self you still suck so those are
all names I think that's all of them we
had a pretty long list so who knows in
the future if we have another kid and it
happens to be a girl I know you might
use some of those names maybe we'll have
totally fresh differently ready names
but I'm excited to eventually share her
with you guys but the reason why we love
sorry do we even say that's the reason
we were most of these are French names
and we specifically were looking up
French champs - that's where he went
honeymoon and we just but that's why we
were so entranced with the French names
