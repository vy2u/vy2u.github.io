huge haul for you most of its from
Marshalls and then I also have I just
have so much just to show you
so it's Marshalls if see which used to
be called my glam bag I got my first one
ever actually this week and then I got
some stuff from mark from Avon and then
I also have some stuff from Target and I
think that's all the places so here we
go so I'll go ahead and do my glam bag
so this is my first one I used to do
Birchbox and then I stopped because it
just seemed like I was like I could
spend that ten dollars a month on
something else because everything was
like trial sized things and usually it
is anyway but it was like stuff I'd
never use but I've heard good things
about it see so I tried it it always
comes with a cute bag this one actually
is really cute it's like a see-through
pink it's gonna be this I think the
theme was like summer or even I do still
have the card I already opened it and
I've already tried out some of the stuff
of course but it's Beach beauty was the
theme and they always have like deals on
the back like percent offs on certain
websites so that's always nice um so
cute bag perfect for like in your beach
bag I'm thinking for just maybe like a
few things like maybe waterproof mascara
chapstick things like that so it came
with this healthy sexy hair guess I
could take it out a trial size but it's
like deluxe you know I mean it's pretty
big
it's the SOI renewal beach spray it says
beach look conditioning and texturising
spray with argan oil it's got this nice
little nozzle here tried to try it out I
already have my not your mother's one
that's a beach babe spray and I really
like it so this would be nice to try as
well I'm perfect for travel size also
came with this kula mineral sunscreen at
SPF of 20 it says it's for your face and
it says it's organic so that's kind of
nice looks like there's like a lot of
extracts you know what I mean yeah
anyway so that's again perfect for
travel and you know you can never I mean
I'm always using sunscreen so duh let's
see
also BH Cosmetics sent a sample from
each of their three California
collection pallets so it comes with
these three colors I'm actually wearing
the this a Malibu the golden one on my
lid right now I think I'm wearing San
Francisco in my crease actually too
so these are from the different I think
one pallet is called Hollywood San
Francisco Malibu
although yeah it's got a picture of like
the different palettes there but yeah
they're really good quality I guess I
could swatch them for you
swatch tastic there you go umm so
they're nice I really really do like
this yellow one whoo
so I'm really really liking that and the
thing about eyeshadows are you never
really like run out of them you don't
have sand so these things are awesome
cuz I'm like I feel like I don't even
need to buy the palette and I just got
like you know three awesome shadows so
um also benefit sent
Benetint it's a small small sized bottle
I guess can kind of wiggle it out of
here I haven't tried this yet I know a
lot of people love it it you know you
can use it for your cheeks or your lips
it's a stain I'm excited to give it a
try and actually speaking of different
types of cheek things I'm using or today
I used the Sonia Kashuk liquid blush and
very fun to put on I use the stippling
brush and I might do a video with how to
apply liquid blush but I really liked it
it's been on for like hours now so it
might not be as obvious but I really
like it so the last thing they said was
this pop beauty what do they call it
party nope pouty pop crayon it's in Rose
romance and I could open it I could I
guess no of course I love but I've been
wanting to swatch I don't know why I
have it and of course it's one of those
roll up crayons ooh that's pretty right
up my alley loving those rose colors so
perfect I know I've seen some other
people I've got different shades of this
so that's kind of fun
so that was what was in my Ipsy bag this
month so I went or no I ordered on
Yvonne's website they have a free
shipping earlier this July and so I got
two different things and this is it's
called the please hold
I primer I love the Marc packaging it's
just so sleek and like just cute you
know what I mean it's so thin and it's
literally just an eye primer how cool is
that and it's a very interesting texture
almost like dry cream
makes sense but it's awesome as an eye
primer this channel is going on all day
I mean it hasn't moved I really like it
it was on clearance though so I'm
wondering if it's like being
discontinued but I read a lot of reviews
that said that a lot of people use this
as concealer too and I bet that would be
nice it probably even be nice under
concealer to like you know prime the
concealer area
so speaking of concealer I also got the
mark saved the day
anti acne concealer stick this one was
like maybe nine dollars and it's just
that a concealer stick but I actually
haven't played with this one yet very
very creamy I mean you could look at it
I got it and whatever the lightest shade
is but it has salicylic acid in it so
it's going to be you know if you put it
on a pimple or just a blemish it's going
to be working towards fighting that
blemish or that pimple while you're
concealing it so it's a win-win
situation
so that's pretty awesome so that's all I
ordered from mark and I again haven't
tried to concealer yet
so at Target I found first of all in
Clarence
I found this Rusk little duo and it was
on clearance for two dollars and six
cents and it's the Rusk sensories I
guess I can open it now that I've showed
it to you guys the Rusk sensories Calm
conditioner and it didn't come with the
shampoo it came with the Russkies wait
what do they call it wired like curling
gel which I've been in need of some for
when I wear my hair naturally curly that
sounds silly to say natural and I need
creams but you know what I mean just
kind of define the curls and this is
becoming very difficult so it's their
Rusk wired flexible styling cream I'm
excited to give it a try again these
were two dollars in total together so
when I went to Marshalls I looked for
the matching shampoo the sensories calm
shampoo and it was like $6.99 so
essentially for seven and then the two
dollars for this for nine bucks I just
got a set of shampoo conditioner and a
like curling cream for nine dollars
total how awesome is that
so be looking at the the random like end
of the aisle target clearance because
they have just like awesome stuff oh I
love Target I just love Clarence I love
it all anyways so at Target I also got
in the dollar section they have so many
cute things and this is a makeup bag but
I'm actually going to
to hold my coupons there's just like
this canvas II feel tight bag you know
really cute liner on the inside you see
the pink and gold stripes so I'm gonna
use it for coupons and receipts I used
to use this sparkly bag but it got
sparkles all over everything and I'm
just so tired of it only a dollar they
all sound like scarves for three dollars
in that dollar spot and all kinds of
stuff I also got my favorite nail files
these are the I don't know if they're
it's only like a dollar thirty and it
comes with two of them and they're both
double-sided it's the trim salon boards
that's all it says it's fine to like
fine I don't think I meant to get that I
think oh well whatever it was only a tie
but these are my favorite types oh yeah
let's see okay now on to O at Marshall's
by the way I got this amazing eye cream
and I've been on the hunt for one
because I have my favorite face cream
but I'm looking for an eye cream that
was not so expensive that I loved and
then I found this it's that I'm gonna
butcher the name it's the Mogador
nurturing eye cream and it lists the
ingredients it is a paraben free it's um
sulfate free all of that even says it
right then and there but it's got argan
oil shea butter jojoba oil or jojoba I
don't know someone tell me how to say
because I've been wondering um it has
vitamin E a lot of things I can't
pronounce let's see and it talks about
the three main agrees the argan oil shea
butter jojoba oil and where it's grown
and what it's used for typically and the
smell of this is amazing the packaging
is so cute it comes with a ton for an
eye cream and guess what it was $5.99 at
Marshall's I will say this though it was
the only one I found and I was really
sad and if you find any and you like if
you find the eye cream specifically and
you'd be willing to pay for it and send
it to me I will pay you back I really
want more and they have no presence
online like anywhere so if you can find
the nurturing eye cream please buy it
and send it to me and I will pay you
back because I'm so sad and I'm like I'm
gonna run out of this eventually and I'm
gonna be like I don't even know where to
buy it but it's really it's filled to
the brim it has a really nice smell it
really it's from Israel that's where
it's made and it makes me think of like
Easter like spices and things like that
oh my gosh I just have fallen in love
with this so seriously anyway okay so on
to all the clothing that I bought at
Marshall's so this is kind of like
back-to-school shopping because well I'm
going back to school soon you know yeah
plus also just things that I just wanted
so this first of all this is just a
workout shirt I got it was like I think
$7 it's just so cute and I've been
wanting like looser ones because most of
mine are like form-fitting type of
workout shirts but these are comfy like
with the sports bra under it and you can
just I don't know there's comfortable so
it's the brand hind' I don't know I just
really like the coral with that purple I
think that's such a pretty combination
and again really really comfy and really
breathable so I was very happy about
that fine so another thing I got three
different take tops from Cynthia Rowley
and the one I'm wearing is one of them
yes I could show you it's just like this
olive green one it's form-fitting but
not too tight and it's got this cute
like kind of almost like it's a v-neck
but it almost looks like a scoop and
it's got like kind of a not a low back
but like a little bit lower so it's like
it's just the best t-shirt ever or tank
top ever and it was $7.99 and then I got
the exact same one in this red color
which I've already worn these are the
most comfortable things ever you can
wear a simple necklace with it a
statement necklace with it you can wear
it to sleep you can wear it out you can
throw a blazer I mean these are awesome
I cannot stress that enough and the
straps are perfect cuz they're not just
spaghetti strap and they're not like the
thick you know like a shirt or
wife-beater type it's just right in the
middle they're just so feminine I love
them and then I also got one in white I
actually went back a second time to get
more of these cuz I fell in love but I
could only find them in white and it
doesn't have the v-neck it's just kind
of a scoop but otherwise it's the same
and again these are all $7.99 so love
all those and then I also got this tank
it's what brand design history and this
one was 1499 did I really pay that much
anyway but it's so cute it's got like
just purple at the bottom kind of like
this tie-dye stripe type look
it makes me it's like nautical but then
it's just like fun and its really comfy
and it's a little bit looser but not too
loose it's just perfect and I was really
on the hunt for tank tops that weren't
see-through because I feel like I have
so many sheer once I have to wear
another tank top underneath and when
it's so hot out you don't want to tank
tops on that defeats the purpose so
there we go
okay so I also got this shirt and this
one was C $12.99 and it's just the
striped and makes me think of Paris you
know the classic Parisian look the
sleeves roll up and button and then the
best part is it's just real cute and on
the back it's a little bow back can you
see that just a little bow it's so cute
but it doesn't go too low so you can
still wear a bra with it without it like
showing in the back you know perfect I
love this for $12.99 I was like dude I'm
gonna wear that thing out when we
wearing it all the time this is just a
steal it was three dollars on clearance
and it's just gonna be a cute pj top
honestly just a simple little it's got
like micro stripes you know what I mean
really tiny stripes got a cute seam down
the middle back and it's v-neck on both
sides just cute and it was $3 love that
another thing I got was just a polo
because I think I don't have any polos
isn't like $12.99 it was where ever
chromium Finch which is so funny because
people will spend you know tons of money
Abercrombie and it just makes me think
of middle school more than anything like
I remember being in middle school being
like oh maybe should Abercrombie and
Hollister clothes and now no one wears
them once you get past a certain age and
it's almost like weird when you did not
weird if you're there like my age and
you wear that's not what I mean I have
Hollister never taught me things I'm
just saying it's not like you know
necessarily something you're like dying
to have at least not my circle of
friends but but I thought this was so
cute and I tried it on it it's so
comfortable really nice feel so I was
like you know what for $12.99 I'll buy
that cuz I don't own a single pillow
which i think is kind of crazy
because I like the look of a pillow
anyway so then I got this top for 16.99
it's a sheer black one it's kind of like
a baby doll type you know where there's
like a seam right here um and then it
ties here I know it's really hard to
but and I would train them on for you
but I just there's no time there's no
time guys
everyone's pressuring me to put up more
videos and I want to but I'm very busy
right now anyway but I really really
like this top just a sheer cute black
top for work let's see this one was all
clearance for seven it's just kind of a
chambray shirt so you see that but it's
got these little polka dots and it's
longer and the sleeves roll up and
button and I figure this will be so cute
with like just black leggings and like
brown suede boots you know what I'm
saying duh it's gonna be so cute hold on
I just knocked everything off okay so
now I got three dresses this one was
1999
it's the brand me me chica and it's a
high-low dress and it's actually the
first high-low dress I bought but it's a
really cute blue pattern I liked and it
cinched at the waist and then it's just
you know the high-low dress would sheer
where it gets longer you know what I
mean but I just really liked the pattern
on it and the fit and the cut is kind of
perfect for me and you can adjust the
strap so I really liked that a lot and
it's not too short in the front you know
you're not looking like a hoochie mama
okay so I also got this one this is from
Express actually but I found it at
Marshall's and I only paid 16.99 for it
and it's got this like blousey top and
then it's really fitted at the bottom
and it's like that elastic feel it looks
I kind of thought on the hanger and I
was like I don't know and then when I
like actually tried it on I was like I
need this dress now so I was very
excited about this find I just love it
and Express dresses usually fit me kind
of weird so I'm just surprised to see
that this one fit me well okay and then
look this dress looks like a little
linen or like cotton dress you know but
it has a heart cut out in the back you
know you see those all over the place on
Instagram on Facebook on all those other
little things know what Pinterest you
kidding it's like all over Pinterest and
so I've never really found what I liked
but again this one doesn't go too low so
I can still wear a bra with it and it
doesn't show through but you know the
front is just a typical scoop neck and
it just goes down to you know just right
above the knee and it's got like a liner
it's just so cute cute little pattern so
breezy in the summer
I'm in the spring and right now it's
like 95 years so I need to be like
pulling this sucker out but that is all
I bought and I hope you guys enjoyed
this and um I guess I'll see you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
