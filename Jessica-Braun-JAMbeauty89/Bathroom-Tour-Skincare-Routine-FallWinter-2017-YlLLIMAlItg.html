you tell with my skin care beard so
today I just wanted to take you guys
along with my dry lips I need to put
something on my lips I wanted to take
you along through my skincare routine
now obviously I don't do a mask every
single day I wish I did but I don't
some masks are okay everyday obviously
not all are like this down here I don't
think I would ever use everyday anyway
so I wanted to show you what I'm using
right now but also what I've just been
using the past few months to help my
skin and I thought I'm gonna have this
mask on for about 20 minutes so I might
as well film a little video kind of vlog
style on my phone and I thought you guys
might enjoy it I know it might be a
little echoey cuz we're in our bathroom
and we're under construction a bit there
but other than that let's go ahead and
get into it so I wanted to show you some
of the things I just use so I use the it
cosmetics bye bye makeup cleansing balm
I love this stuff so much it takes your
makeup right off you just put it on your
face and then get warm water on it and
it just completely like emulsifies the
makeup this is something new to me this
is the equation gentleman shares in
cleanser this is just like my favorite
serum a hydrating cleanser it's the same
feel like it's gotta be the same
ingredients I love this stuff and then
the masks that I'm wearing today on my
forehead I've got this moisturize and
moon mask my glossy a it's really
moisturizing and up there like hey guys
up here I don't feel like I have a lot
of like breakout issues for me it's more
of dryness so I like to put that there
but I am having some hormonal breakouts
so I'm using this guy organics dead sea
mud mask and I always use this little
elf like mask tool to put it on my
beagle is howling at another
oh my gosh anyway are you also from time
to time use my Clarisonic little
cleanser I don't really notice the
difference between this versus the
handheld one I have both hold on
you would mid bark
that's enough Pinocchio yeah why don't
you put the laundry away for me buddy
that would be incredibly helpful I feel
like so many parts of our house are
under construction it's crazy
anyway alright so I like the Clarisonic
too I think you need to spend this much
no because they are expensive but I do
like it a lot
so in here is kind of you can see like
here's our bathroom in here is where I
keep most of the skincare I'm using
right now aside from a few exceptions
I'll show you in a second so I know it's
kind of dark in here but I've got some
things for break out so I've got the
Mario Badescu drying lotion the origins
little super spot remover it's just a
really strong high percentage of
salicylic acid comic contact lenses
whoops this I've almost used up I think
I've been using for too long
it's the algae this complete eye renewal
balm it's almost gone this is the
moisturizer I'm using right now by drunk
elephant it definitely feels like
whipped cream you all go ahead and do it
because I'll use it a little bit but you
push it down and it comes up through
it's a nice moisturizer has a very light
smell but nothing that would bother you
it just honestly feels like it's a good
moisturizer but I don't think it's worth
the price
it's very standard to me so I'll use it
up I like it but would I buy it again no
only because it's so expensive this is
the tatcha
pure one-step camellia cleansing oil I
do like this it's truly a cleansing oil
in fact I loved it except for I started
to break out a lot and have a lot of dry
skin let me rephrase I started to have a
lot of dry skin around my eyes and
that's where I use this the most so I've
started to wonder is it this so I've
kind of put it to the side and I've been
going back to my cleansing balm that I
know I love but that was just something
kind of interesting I noticed with this
so I don't know so I have some serums I
have the buff a serum from the ordinary
which just has a lot of different things
in it that's why it's called a buff a
serum I do like that but I like even
more the drunk elephant version marula
oil this stuff is amazing super oily on
your face you don't need a lot okay so I
also have my milk makeup like stick
toner which I love I use this more when
I travel not necessarily every night but
it's a toner in a stick and I just think
that is the coolest idea ever
especially if you carry things on and
you don't have a lot of room in your
liquids bag and the other one I have is
this caffeine solution from the ordinary
and this I use on my under-eye typically
in the mornings I do it sometimes at
night I also have one of my favorites
the skin to Naevia Post makeup recovery
spray this stuff is just great it says
that gently clears pores helps prevent
breakouts I like to think of it as kind
of a toner or an essence um so I just
spray it on right after I remove my
makeup I've also fallen in love with
this stuff from Paula's Choice it's
their redness relief BHA lotion
exfoliant I am horrible about skipping
exfoliating and I don't mean like with
the little beads I mean like a chemical
exfoliator I used to be really good
about it but I've really kind of fallen
off the bandwagon so when I started
using this I'm like yes I'm noticing it
different in the difference in the
redness on my cheeks which is amazing I
also have been using the drunk elephant
Shaba
complex eye serum I like it again the
price tag I don't you know with serums
it's so tricky cuz you don't always
notice a difference so it might be doing
amazing things for my skin but it's hard
to see the difference and I just find it
so difficult to spend that price tag on
something like that
I don't know so if you've been using
drunk elephant products and there are
certain ones you really think are worth
the money please let us know below
because I'm very curious and then I've
been kind of switching off this is this
fresh rose deep hydration facial toner
the idea of a toner being hydrating
confuses me but I think it's a cool idea
and I do feel like my skin loves this
stuff it's got like little rose
in it and you just put it on a cotton
pad so I do like that but it definitely
has a strong rose scent this my skin
also loves its this essence the Vino
perfect essence from Kota Lee holy moly
I feel like I've been using this forever
and I've barely made a dent I don't know
price-wise how this compares to the sk2
essence that's super famous I'd be
curious because they've got to be really
similar formula wise so I also have this
which again I had been using with this
tatcha this is the Garnier gentle
sulfate free cleanser and I thought oh
it'll be like my serum a hydrating
cleanser mmm no it's really not and
again I don't know which one of these
was making my skin super dry so I kind
of just stopped both and I really don't
want to start up either one of them
because I know you know what I mean so I
don't know maybe it was this cuz this
was so like kind of hydrating and oil
like I find it hard to believe that this
would be drying my skin out I also just
keep makeup brushes in here because for
what I'm in a rush I have makeup in this
drawer but in this drawer also keep like
my perfumes it's kind of my life daily
little system here but I also have some
skincare stuff in here so this is what I
use to help remove masks that are
difficult to remove from ELF so I love
this elf brush I also have a trial of
the Kate Somerville it's full of Kate
I've only used it once so I really don't
know how I feel about it but I've got
this lash serum from Grande lash I did
notice the difference I haven't used it
in a while though and with these kinds
of things you have to just keep using
and repurchasing this stuff is the bomb
it's from Dermalogica it's their nightly
lip treatment holy cannoli
this stuff is amazing it makes your lips
feel crazy like soft and in the morning
it really does make a difference and
then I have some nog you guys know I
love my little nut masks I use this all
the time when I travel that the soothing
I've got the hydrating and then I also
have this overnight I've loved this
stuff for so long the Korres Greek
yogurt advanced nourishing sleeping
facial so you put this on at night as
like your last step and you just like
and it kind of sinks into your skin like
a lotion does and it's just amazing I
also have these little eyepatch is you
put on for five to ten minutes patchy
ology is one of my favorite brands
because they always have quick ones so
this is their flash patch hi Joe I think
you leave it on for like five minutes
and there's like thirty in here and it's
great for your fine lines and anti-aging
and stuff like that puffiness then I
have all my sheet masks holy cannoli
I use that phrase twice I have so many
sheet masks I randomly will get them
from brands you know in subscription
boxes and I keep them all some of my
favorite brands that I've actually gone
out and repurchased myself again it's
this patch ology brand and it's their
hydrating flash mask and it's five
minutes you throw it on it really makes
a difference before you put on makeup so
I brought this like to the few events
I've gone to I usually do this
beforehand a lot of these I just haven't
tried I've tried a lot of the bio bell
ones I haven't tried these to a
particular this is cool because it's
like a primer one but the few I've tried
I did like do I think they're like
life-changing now I've tried a lot of
these Tony moly ones these were in like
a Christmas set last year they're so
cute I told Tyler Mike we gotta use
these up this holiday so he and I are
just gonna go masks crazy cuz when he
doesn't have like a beard going on he'll
do masks with me which is fun so anyway
there's a lot of masks that I'm still
getting used to like where there's like
different steps involved which is really
neat so I don't know anyway so I I want
to use these I mean the idea is none of
these are like long lasting effects
they're more for like that day to
rejuvenate your skin and they really do
make your skin look different but you
know you got to use them all the time so
I've really got to get better about
being in a good cycle with those so
that's like my skincare routine oh the
last thing I love my lineage lip
sleeping mask I put this on at night as
well oh Jessica
um and I love that this is just my
jewelry box if you were curious so I'm
gonna wash my face but I've done a
couple of other skincare videos if you
are interested in them I can link them
below if you enjoyed this kind of
informal style I know it might have made
some of you guys I tried not to move the
camera around too much it's really
difficult with things like this so if
you get motion sickness
so sorry because I feel you because when
I watch videos like this I get that same
feeling but I will link the products
that I mentioned down below if you are
curious about trying any of them and
other than that I hope you'll subscribe
and give this video a thumbs up and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
