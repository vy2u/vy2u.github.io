review of four different drugstore
primers and kind of how they stack up
against each other down below if you
look in the description box I'll have a
list of the ones that I mentioned the
prices and a link for all of them in
case you're interested in a certain one
I will talk about skin types and you
know how certain primers that might work
really well for me will work differently
if you have oily skin because I've kind
of got combo so it's right in between so
I will get into that so let's go ahead
and get started before you ask what I'm
wearing on my lips I'm wearing this
Milani matte lipstick and matte kiss and
it's just I mean these are around like
five or six dollars at least at the
store I buy them in they're amazing so
just so you know alright so let's go
ahead and go in order I'm gonna start
with the primer that I liked the least I
only own four drugstore primers I've
owned a lot in my time but I declutter
all the time like all the time
and I recently got rid of like 70% of my
makeup collection so this is what I kept
one of them I kept just to show you but
I'm gonna get rid of after I this video
so that one that I like the least is
this wet and wild one this is the one
wild coverall primer now the first
offense of this primer is its smell it
smells like Elmer's glue now that's
something I can get past but I know that
a lot of people that have really
sensitive noses or they're just really
sensitive to smells
this will really bother you I mean it's
a very strong pungent smell but getting
beyond that you know these are all the
same kind of packaging where it's just a
squeezy tube and it's kind of a white
formula that looks like Elmer's glue
again a lot of the primers are like this
so that doesn't bother me but when you
apply it I just feel that it doesn't do
anything it you blend it in and you know
it's kind of more of a lotion e primer
so if you have dry skin you would think
that this would be good for you because
it's got more of a lotion e texture to
it whereas some have more of a silicon
texture to it
and it feels kind of smooth but kind of
sticky a little bit sticky literally
parts of it it kind of feels like
Elmer's glue in a way not as as much but
still so you let it sit in your on your
face for a while and when I put my
foundation on it and just feel like it's
it's pulling the primer with it like the
primer is not saying put even if I let
it sit for a few minutes and it just
didn't make a difference
and for me if I'm gonna take the time to
actually put on a primer and I don't
wear primers every single day but if I'm
gonna take the time to actually put it
on it darn well better be doing
something because if it's doing nothing
then I feel like I'm just adding more
chemicals to my face you know just more
nonsense that I don't need so for those
reasons this is the one I just wouldn't
recommend I know some people have had
really good luck I have a demo with this
primer and the coverall foundation I
actually like the coverall foundation I
can link that entire demo and review of
the whole really cheap wet wild line
below if you're interested but not my
favorite moving beyond that my next one
in line so like this was like fourth
place this would be third place this is
the Maybelline master prime phii studio
primer and they have I think three
different versions of this this is the
blur and smooth one and it's in 100 now
this is a very very similar texture to
that where it's got a squeezy tube and
it's again a white kind of lotion
formula this one doesn't really have a
smell and it feels very very similar now
this one I would say performs very
similarly to the wet wild but this one
has a little bit more of a I don't want
to say silicone but kind of that
slippery feel to it but in a good way
the cover on one was a little bit sticky
but this one feels a little bit more
slippery where it kind of does blur your
pores nicely so if you've got really
enlarged pores this is one that I think
you would like but this would be for the
person that has dry skin a enlarged
pores like if you've got both of those
then I think you would like this a lot
now I don't
very large poor so that porn filling is
not as big of a deal to me at least not
right now where my skin is but it does a
nice job the only offense for this one
is I don't feel like it holds on to your
foundation that long so again I didn't
feel like it made enough of a difference
for me to make me want to use it in the
mornings I feel like we both of these
just wearing foundation on its own
performs exactly the same as when I wear
with these so that's kind of my two
cents on these two now my top two they
both perform differently and so really
they could be tied for number one when
it comes to drugstore primers but I'm
going to tell you what my favorite
favorite is this would be number two for
me this is the maybelline baby skin and
this one is a very different texture
than all the ones I'm mentioning in this
video this one is a true like a clear
primer it's very very poor filling so if
that is a huge issue for you you would
like this better than any of the ones
I'm going to mention including the
number one one I'm going to mention so
if that's your main issue you will like
this a lot now this is one that when you
apply it you want to push it into your
skin because of its formula it can tend
to almost disappear if you just buff it
into your skin but if you kind of press
it where you need it especially if you
just need it here you know you don't
have to put primer all over your face so
if you really only have trouble here and
here and leave your t-zone and then your
nose area then just put it there you
know you don't have to have it all the
way out here in your cheeks on your chin
if you don't need it this is really nice
of learning out your pores I do think it
helps hold onto your foundation longer
because it's filling in your pores so if
you've got really oily skin this is one
you like as well because I feel like
kind of blocks those areas so the oils
not producing as much or at least it's
not secreting through as easily and so
because it's blocking that your
foundation lasts longer so that's how I
would recommend using this one for that
skin type anyway my number one primer
and I'm going to show you while I'm
talking a demo of me applying this this
is the Rimmel lasting finish primer the
reason I like this more than anything is
because it's again that white lotion II
texture but it not only feels
moisturizing on my
skin especially since my skin can tend
to be a little bit drying at times but
it lets my natural shine come through
and I don't mean like oily shine I just
mean like kind of a satiny look to my
face so it gives your skin a satin look
but it actually hold out onto the
foundation all day and it doesn't I
don't know what I would say is that if
you have oily skin this might not be
ideal because it does kind of keep your
skin with that healthy glow but it's not
anything like crazy like I feel like
some primers just don't work at all and
so then you're just a li straight
through it I don't mean like that I mean
it kind of it's like it controls the
amount but it gives you a good amount I
don't know how else to explain it I used
it today and I just feel like it lasts
all day it makes my skin look healthy
and glowy because that's my problem the
reason I don't like using primers
everyday is that I feel like so many of
them just make my skin feel more dry and
I'm like why would I want my skin to
feel more dry and then put foundation on
top of it that can just kind of make it
worse make it look worse anyway so this
would be my number one recommendation
but again if you have really really oily
skin I would say try the baby skin I
think you'd like that better or if you
have really big pores other than that
the other two I know again these aren't
like the worst products in the world a
lot of people love these it really
depends on your skin the good news here
is that all of these are really
inexpensive all of these are under $10
so you can't you know you can't really
go wrong with trying any of them but
that's my two cents on them hopefully
this was helpful for you guys again more
