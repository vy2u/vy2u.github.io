to share with you a comparison maybe
they're dupes for each other video of
two different loose powders one is a
favorite that I've loved for a while now
to Laura Mercier loose setting powder
it's in the shade translucent but the
other one that a lot of people have been
asking me how it compares to the Laura
Mercier one is this coverfx one called
the perfect setting powder these were
both sent to me so I'm really not biased
in this way it's not a sponsored video
at all I'm really going to give you my
honest opinion on both of these so I
have a demo of me applying these if you
want to only see the demo of these
side-by-side I will put the timestamps
here on the screen as well as a
clickable time stamp down below if you
want to hear about these products and
the claims they have the prices in
comparison let's go and talk about that
right now
so the Laura Mercier when I'm on the
forests website it's thirty eight
dollars compared to the cover effects
setting powder which is thirty five so
there's a difference of three dollars
the Laura Mercier is one ounce and this
one is no way oh my gosh so this is one
ounce this is only 0.35 ounces for $35
and if you're thinking grams that might
be easier to understand 29 grams on the
Laura Mercier for $38 for three dollars
less you're only getting 10 grams so
it's almost tripled the amount for three
dollars more that is so surprisingly but
now that I'm like looking at the
packaging it makes sense because this is
filled this is only filled to here
because there's a little sister so Wow
let's talk about the packaging so the
cover FX one the lid twirls off now what
I love about this packaging is this is
built-in so it actually stays on so you
still have all the powder there but it
clicks oops you can see it flying it
clicks in and so then it's protected so
it's awesome for travel it doesn't get
everywhere it's awesome just generally
so when you open it there's not powder
flying so that I think is amazing it's
such a smart design the laura mercier
one you open it
life is kind of mattified I do think the
packaging looks nicer on this but of
course it is just open so there's a huge
risk of when you open it powder just
squirting everywhere etc now these both
the lids grew on really types of all
disease so I mean if you're traveling
with it it's not going to like open and
still into your bag unless you just
didn't screw the lid on so there's I
mean they're both fine for travel but I
do think the packaging the coverfx one
with that foot that part is really smart
alright I love doing these videos this
is like fun like I'm researching with
you guys so I'm on support' website with
the cover FX so let's read the claims of
this so it says it's an ultra
translucent loose powder that sets
makeup for all-day wear while imparting
a soft focus airbrushed finish that's
why I've loved the laura mercier so they
both have that same idea where it really
softens your look it kind of if you feel
like you've got like splotchiness or
maybe you feel like your contour is a
little like it's sticking out and it's
not blended well with your blush and
your highlight you know this is a great
way if you just kind of dust on your
face it really does soften and blur your
look if you're nervous about using
setting powders you want ones like this
not necessarily be white white setting
powders because those are the ones that
can not always but can look like there's
flashback or there's you know just kind
of cakiness and it's like why is my face
so much paler these don't do that these
are really amazing and kind of foolproof
alright so again still the cover FX 1
says this ultra lightweight loose
setting powder is consciously formulated
without talc for an incredibly
translucent finish that sets makeup for
all they wear minimize this transfer
without adding any color to the skin or
overpowering your foundation finish that
is one thing you know if you want a
glowy look but you still want to set it
this does a great job both of them do at
setting your makeup without completely
taking away that nice dewy finish it da
boy does take a little bit away but you
can still see your skin you can still
you know it really does a nice job ideal
for the baking makeup technique this
setting powder is formulated with light
diffusing particles that blur and smooth
for a skin perfecting airbrush effect
doesn't look choppy or Drive features
Universal shade for a translucent finish
on all skin tones so it has this one
which is for light medium and then they
had medium deep which is a you know it's
a much deeper tone so I think that it's
awesome that has more than one shade
because then you know you've got a much
deeper skin tone you're looking at this
like okay no that's going to make me
look like a ghost they have an option
that works and again they're both
translucent so it doesn't need to match
your skin tone but it's nice to have one
that's a lot closer to your skin tone
than not so I think that was so smart of
them so now let's read the laura mercier
claim it says a cult favorite is the
award winner silky powder with the touch
of to your coverage to set makeup for
lasting work so it locks and makeup for
long-lasting words they both do and if
you saw I did do a an Instagram post
like sponsored by Laura Mercier a couple
months ago there's so much drama around
that it was crazy
anyway but where I have lipstick on my
hand and then when you put this powder
on it and you like push and white it
does not move and the idea is that these
types of powders really do an amazing
job of keeping your foundation in place
it does not move it is so amazing like
you could literally wipe it and it
doesn't move it doesn't add any weight
or texture creates a modern matte finish
with the touch of sheer coverage it
absorbs oil reduces shine so this does
not have those claims so I do think
these are very very similar and you'll
see that in the demo
it's almost undetectably different but I
do think this does a better job of
letting your skin kind of breathe
through it whereas this does mattify so
if you don't want more matte skin you
might want to opt for the cover FX one
the powder is a little denser than an
average powder providing super smooth
even application and blending no
flashback this one specifically says no
flashback to cover FX one I have not
noticed any class rep with it either I
think it's interesting though that it
doesn't say that it doesn't have
flashback right I mean it just seems odd
but definitely not with the Laura
Mercier it's a mating makeup arts that
use this because there is no chance for
flashbacks you look great in photos
creates a soft focus effect to subtly
blur the look of fine lines and
imperfections it will not settle into
fine lines or pores and never looks
cakey now again talking about my fine
lines I talk about them a lot under my
eyes neither one of these I mean you can
still see my fine line so I don't think
that either one of them don't sink into
fine lines I think they do but again I
haven't found one that doesn't anyway so
it's not really a surprise to me oh my
gosh guys I was wrong
Laura Mercier has two shades as well
they have the lighter one and the deeper
one how did I not know that that's
awesome
so they have translucent and then
translucent medium deep so it's the same
two-tone I feel crazy that I feel like
they didn't used to have that maybe I
just didn't look close enough that's
awesome though the oh yeah okay it says
the just release translucent medium deep
shade was designed to be completely
translucent on medium deep to the
deepest skintone ensuring that every
skin tone gets a perfectly flawless
translucent finish that's awesome I like
to wear these typically today I
typically like to wear these before I
put on blush and highlighter and bronzer
because it does a great job of setting
the foundation underneath so that way
when I go to put on a blush it doesn't
just get stuck on an area that happens
to still be tacky so I love that for
this but you can also top your makeup
with it just to kind of make it all look
a little more seamless so either way or
you could do both but that's just kind
of the way I do it let's go ahead and
get into the demo of me applying needs
on two different sides of my face so
let's try these two I'm going to use
this in two ways I'm going to kind of
bake with it not baked baked I'm just
going to really set my under eye but I'm
going to use a Beauty Blender so I'm not
going to do all the contouring and stuff
and now I'm just going to set with just
a powder brush the rest of my face
that's how I use it naturally so I want
to be you know kind of authentic with
you guys and not you know there are a
lot of other people that use it in a lot
of ways differently than me all right so
I actually have two different concealers
on as well I've got too many variables
going on in this science experiment but
I have the cap on D lock-it concealer
over here and the Tarte shape tape over
here because I'm also doing another
video so I'm just going to kind of
lightly set this area with powder and
then I'm going to do the same with a
different part of the Beauty Blender for
this side so I'm going to leave that on
for just a little bit not perfect that's
okay but I am going to take a powder
brush now I kind of lightly tap it off
because
need a ton for this laura mercier I'm
just going to kind of set the rest of my
makeup with it so I like doing you know
pretty much everywhere because these
really do make a difference in how long
your foundation stays trying to only say
stay on the side this side and just kind
of set I'm not I don't have a ton on my
brush because I don't really need a ton
but I do like how this totally makes a
difference in how long your foundation
stays on so my skin is definitely
modified let me kind of zoom in here you
can certainly see dry skin on both sides
that's more my skin than anything but I
feel like it's a little bit drier on
this side than this side like the the
fine lines are a little bit more
pronounced on this side that could just
be my eyes are different you know but I
do feel like it is a little bit drier
everything else pretty much looks the
same
I think end of the day this one's a
little bit more mattifying than this one
price-wise you're getting way way more
three times as much with the Laura
Mercier they both have those two
different skin tones so that doesn't
really matter you know you could go
either way with it if you like the
packaging of the cover FX one with that
lift off thing so there's definitely a
lot of pros for both hardly really any
cons for either one it's kind of just
which brands you want to buy or really
if you want to just get more bang for
your buck so both good I know like I
don't know this video is helpful or not
because when there's not that many
differences between them and they're so
similar and price-wise they're I guess
the same but really not if you really
think about it it's hard to know if this
is helpful for you guys so let me know
if it was I love doing these comparison
kind of videos I'm filming a bunch of
these today just because I was in the
mood to like do some research and
compare different products side-by-side
I'm wearing two different concealers
today what else am I do what else that I
do I'm wearing well I guess I'm not
wearing two different foundations I'm
wearing a Neutrogena one but I applied
in two different ways so if those videos
are up I will link them because I like I
said I sold a bunch today if not stay
tuned because they'll be up there soon
I hope you'll subscribe in the meantime
and catch me on my social media which is
right up there and say hi and I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
