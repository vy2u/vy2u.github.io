Jessica and today kind of a different
video for my channel bauble bar
contacted me and asked if they could
send me some free things kind of in a
sponsored video and I was like I don't
know and you guys know how I am about
sponsored videos so I looked on their
site and I own some bauble bar pieces
that I really love so I thought about it
for a few days and finally I decided
that I did want to do it because one of
my favorite things they do is this $10 I
think they call it the Buried bauble I
get in my inbox buried I think is the
word but they'll have a $10 deal on one
jewelry item on their site and they'll
give you like a hint like some sort of
clue and you've got to find it and I
think yeah I just think that's so fun so
most of the time I will just search for
that and see if it's something that I
like it if I do I'll get it so if you're
someone like me you just don't have a
lot of money to spend on things like
jewelry that is a way better way to get
these really they really are a nice
quality jewelry and I could tell you
that like some of the let me find some
of the ones I already own from bauble
bar this is a bauble bar necklace I got
with like a steel eye makeup set and
I've owned a bracelet like this from I
think I bought some from like forever 21
and I like forever 21 jewelry because
it's cheap and it lasts about as long as
you had expected to last but it's always
on trend and things like that but this
is way I don't know they're just better
made they seem like heavier more
high-quality metals that they use things
like that so honestly I've had this for
a while and I've been impressed with how
long in his last without tarnishing or
anything like that whereas my forever 21
ones I threw out like months after
having it because it had tarnished and
regardless I've had it and I liked it so
it took me a while to decide but I said
okay yes you can sponsor a video so yes
this video is sponsored but I'm just
gonna show you what it is and you make
your own opinions about it so these are
the products that I picked out that I
wanted to share with you guys that I
thought works
and I'm trying to I'm trying to be more
edgy with my style not trying to be
something that I'm not but I do think
that there are a lot of kind of more
edgy things that I would be comfortable
wearing that I just always like to stay
in my bubble and I do think it would be
healthy for me to branch out a little
bit I'm knocking a little bit so I
picked up pieces that were I thought
perfectly bridge the gap between edgy
and crazy trendy and normal my normal
meaning like my style because that's
normal to me so yeah I will say I love
that all their jewelry and it even came
in this stuff when I bought it on
HauteLook comes in cute little like nice
cloth baggies so I've got like five of
them and these are great I use a bauble
bar bag when I travel actually one that
I already had so the first pair I picked
out were these howlite guillotine drops
and these are really really long and I
don't have any earrings like this but I
loved the gold detail and I really
really liked that almost marbling
looking stone that's both up like near
the stud where it goes knew you're in
and the very bottom and what I liked
about these is that they're so they're
girly still like I loved they were still
girly in their seemingly delicate but I
think they're also kind of just a little
bit edgier than what I would typically
wear and so this was the first one that
when I saw it I was like duh so I really
really like these I'm really excited I
might be bringing these with me on my
honeymoon we will see so the next one's
I picked out are these slim bow drops
and these are certainly slim they're
golden in color and these are so
different than anything I own because
they go through your ears and then they
like hang in both the front in the back
which is really on trend right now and
they have a lot of those ones that have
like the ball in the front in the back
but that's I don't know so far that's
not quite my style so I didn't pick out
any of those but if you know you've been
looking for some they do have those but
I like these because these are so
perfect for like dressing up and that
made it sound like I'm like playing
dress-up but I mean you know like if
you're going out to a nice day
or anything like that I think these
would be perfect because they are really
delicate and I just love these I'm so
excited to wear these okay this next
pair of earrings are very edgy but I
really like them they're called the
spiked
chief deaths drops and I think these are
so cool because they are more edgy for
me but they're still wearable and I
think because they're more muted colors
you can totally wear them without them
being the most obvious thing in the
universe but they're still really cool
up close and I love that it's got like
the three little spikes on the bottom
and just again I like the muted colors
because that makes me feel like I
totally can rock something like this but
again it's not so loud I love these I
think these are cool and they feel I
haven't worn them yet but they feel
pretty lightweight they do feel
lightweight for what they are because
you know sometimes like some of the
earrings I have that I love and I wear
anyway they're really heavy so they like
these are light but they're really heavy
so you kind of feel like you can just
feel it sometimes it kind of gives me a
headache but these feel pretty light so
that is exciting to me okay the last two
things I got our necklaces and I these
are both very different from each other
you'll notice most of the things I
picked out are like gold cuz I've
noticed I have a lot of silver but I
actually really like wearing gold more
and I just don't have as much so I was
excited to pick out some golden things
and it's called the facets layered
necklace and it's got all of these
layers and I own a few layered necklaces
but they always get like tied up with
each other so then they just end up
looking like one strand that's like
weirdly twisted but this was so cool and
what I really liked about it is it had
this really long part and I usually get
turned off by things like that but I
realized that they can make so many
outfits look so much dressier without
really having to do much you could tuck
it in you know if you don't want it just
dangling there and it'll just kind of
look like it goes on forever or you
could have it on the outside but I again
I think you can dress this up so
beautifully but you could also just wear
for every day and I just loved all the
little details isn't this
so pretty I am so excited to wear this
and it's a normal like chain length for
like the normal part which I also liked
it's not like it starts really really
low it just goes low but it starts
really high which I love oh my gosh that
might be my favorite thing I got the
last thing I picked out is called the
gold orbit collar and it is this one
piece of golden metal and you literally
okay I gotta admit the reason I wanted
this was because it made me think of
ancient Egypt and how I have like been
obsessed with all things ancient
Egyptian all my life like since I was a
kid I would asked for books of just
about it and so the fact that it was
like this one plate of golden metal just
made me think of that and it's
comfortable I thought when I got it like
that it would just be aware but it
doesn't it's so light it doesn't feel
like I'm wearing anything which is
pretty cool and it also makes me think
of Princess Jasmine I mean because of
course it does
so that's pretty cool because that is
how me and Tyler met so this just is
just special I just like it so that is
definitely the first time I've ever
owned anything like this but I think
it's pretty cool
and this one came at the much bigger bag
which is even more awesome I'm totally
gonna be using these so I'll have prices
for all of these products listed below
as well as the link for bauble bar I I
will say what I do like about bauble bar
is that they have a big enough selection
but it's not overwhelming because
sometimes I feel like like my favorite
shop shop lately calm they can have like
so many choices that it's so
overwhelming and when you look for like
layered gold necklace you get like five
thousand results and it's just too much
whereas with this you know they do have
a limited stock because they're a little
more choosy and what they're going to
sell which i think is actually really
cool I just thought that was kind of
nice you feel like it's more curated and
more and more like a boutique go for
like any type of percent offs I know
like they usually have like a some sort
of percent off if you're just new to the
site like most websites would so check
out for that they said they would give
me a coupon code so whatever that is I
will definitely have that information
below but also that buried bauble that's
what I would do that's what I did
to kind of start my little bauble bar
collection was just doing those $10
berry baubles because $10 is not much
and that way you can kind of slowly
build up your collection and it is
really it does feel really well made and
I've had good experience with what
pieces I have that I've had from the
past so you guys know I wouldn't do a
sponsored video for a company that I
didn't feel strongly about so hopefully
this review was helpful for you guys and
I will catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
