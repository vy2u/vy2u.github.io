gonna be sharing with you my February
favorites and flops and I also going to
include some extra kind of lifestyle
things I never talk about things I'm
loving outside of the makeup world okay
I said I shouldn't say never but I feel
like it's very rare so I want to start
doing that from time to time because
there are a lot of things that I'm
really excited about that I use every
single day that's not makeup related
that I thought you might be interested
in hearing but I'll put those at the end
in case you're like I don't care about
your life outside of this which is fine
so I'll put those at the end so let's go
ahead and get into it so one of my first
favorites is from Sephora and it is this
Z palette and it's just a smaller size
so this is the Z palette I already have
and it's a really large one but compared
to this this is almost half the size but
it's a little bit longer so we could put
it this way bit than its money to you
see them saying this is the perfect size
because I'm able to put a bunch of
shadows that I absolutely love in this
and I it's a good size for traveling
because it'll still fit in my makeup bag
without being like gigantic like this
one is so I loved this and I love the
little Sephora stripes on it I actually
have this full of some Mac shadows some
carroty shadows and I think there might
be one or two makeup geek ones in here
as well I love these if you didn't see
my Mac dupes video with a bunch of
carroty eyeshadows they're really really
good and there were a lot of my Mac
eyeshadows I literally just took out and
put the carroty one because they carroty
one is better the dupe for rice paper is
actually prettier than rice paper itself
it's more pigmented it's just prettier
so there are a lot of those in here so I
know this is like my all my favorites
just in one so I will leave that video
if you haven't seen it but I love this
palette so a dud right off the bat
speaking of palettes is this one from M
which is Michele Vaughn's makeup line
and I never really tried anything from
this so there's like a lip product or
two over here which I haven't even used
cuz I don't I don't like that idea like
I don't
that one's glossy err eye
don't really use lip products in that
way and shadow gets in them so but the
shadows in here this is the one this is
the life palette mini and I don't know
oh this is called valentine life
seductress edition so is this a bronzer
yeah this is the bronzer and the
bronzers okay you know it's fine but the
shadows like some of them are okay and
some of them are just terrible but
they're really kind of gritty and
they're not really pigmented you can
barely see them so I kept trying them
thinking oh it'll get better the black
ones really pigmented this green one is
okay like they're just kind of mmm so I
was really sad to see that but I love
the packaging is magnetic it's a very
pleasing clothes and it's really thick
and it's heavier than I thought it would
be so I think the packaging is really
well made it feels very high-end I was
just kind of disappointed in the actual
quality so I'll try it out a couple more
times but honestly I just was not
impressed which made me sad now that
means that I've tried like no other
michelle phan products and i know that
there are some people that really love
them so I don't know so moving on to my
next favorite these Sonia Kashuk brushes
are amazing I have the number 29 brush
which I've had for a while now it's a
blush one and it's just a perfect
circular dome shape it's the perfect
shape and it's just perfect is the
perfect blush brush this is also this is
the number two one and it's also
marketed as a blush brush I actually got
it on clearance at Target so I don't
know if it's being discontinued but I'll
link it if I can find it it's just a
little bit more it's just thinner so
it's so fluffy though and I used it to
contour today and I really really liked
it and I just think the handles are
really nice the gold barrels are really
pretty that it doesn't shed no matter
how many times I've cleaned it I love
these brushes I want to get like every
single one in the line another favorite
is from boots number seven and it's
their radiant glow concealer I'm wearing
this today it's one of those that kind
of reminds me the YSL ones where you
click the back and the concealer comes
through the brush but there's something
about this concealer it just blends away
so perfectly but it highlights that area
it is so
beautiful and every time I used it I
think oh my gosh like it blends into
your skin so quickly it reminds me of
the Maybelline Dream Lumi one that I
love I'm about in that in a while
but I love that one it does the same
thing where you just like touch it and
it melts into the skin and it looks
flawless all day I just I love this so
that was I kind of hate that the package
it gets really dirty because it's this
like you know silver metallic but I love
the product because anyone else get
annoyed when you know what it's a brush
like this I feel like I can't I don't
know like I feel like I can't keep it
clean no matter what I do it's all over
the lid like it drives me nuts I hate
that another favorite oh my gosh and
again I want to get some more colors
this is the color pop lip liner or
lippie pencil and it's in the shade
bound but the formula the color is
beautiful what I love the color
it's just a very matte kind of rose
color but the formula is unbelievable
you guys these do not move but they're
not dry because I feel like you either
get a really creamy lip pencil but it
just slide all around after a while or
you get a really dry one but it doesn't
move but this one's got both going for
it it is unbelievable
I really think I'm in a place to order
again soon and order a couple different
shades I wouldn't mind getting rid of
all my other lip liners and just using
this because I know that it's not going
to move I can trust it so I love that
but the shade bound is really pretty too
and this it's pigmented enough that you
could fill in your entire lip and just
color it in and just wear that as like a
matte lip color it's so beautiful
another dud is this wet wild one set
wonder gel polish it's in the shade
pinky swear it's supposed to be one step
where you put it on with no primer no
topcoat or anything no light and it's
supposed to just be amazing no and I
should have known I mean there's only
dollar ninety-nine the colors really
pretty it was pretty opaque but I had to
do two coats because it wasn't that
opaque and it was shipping like within
like an hour and then my parts were just
peeling off like really cheap polishes
do so I haven't tried it with a primer
but I'm like well that kind of defeats
the purpose though cuz the idea is that
this is one step so I probably still
will try it with a prime
or with a top coat just to see if it
does better I would assume it would do
better but I just thought it was like
man but it was only a dollar ninety-nine
I actually bought another shade in
pardon my peach which is like a neon
peach and I haven't tried this one yet
I'm gonna try it on my toes but um yeah
so you know that's just kind of my two
cents on that if you've tried any other
shades and you've had good results let
me know cuz I I mean it's only a dollar
ninety-nine I wouldn't mind trying
another color too
alright another favorite is this
Maybelline brow satin it's sometimes
called the define and fill it just
depends apparently but I used it today I
cannot stop using it because it's got
the pencil side I think this might have
been in my favorites last month - but
it's got powder on a sponge on this side
and it just is exactly what I need it
makes doing my brows so fast
the only downside is that this powder
like when you're kind of brushing
through with the you have a separate
spoolie which I kind of hate but where
else would I wear also they put the
spoolie there's only two ends so unless
there's like a third end coming out you
know but so I've got a separate spoolie
and I'm brushing through and sometimes
the powder will get up above so I have
to kind of whisk it away so I mean it's
not that big of a deal I just wish it
didn't but it is a power so it's kind of
expected that that would happen I just
love this another favorite is from Mac
and I haven't bought like a brand new
product from math in a long time
I really haven't this is the Paint Pot
in soft ochre and I have been using
painterly for a very long time and I
still have my paint really it's like
half gone but this one is a little more
yellow tone and I thought I just kind of
want to try that the painterly one is a
little more rose toned I mean there's
still like neutral colors but it is
perfect I use it under my eye shadow
look today they both work wonderfully I
think I like soft ochre a little bit
better with my more yellow tone skin but
if you have more of a pink tone than you
probably like painterly either way you
go they look fine I just like the way
this looks something better and these
are great they completely mute out the
area on your lid and painterly in soft
ochre just really popular ones few are
fair light skin like I am then they're
great bases for your eyeshadow moving on
to some
other body favorites this is from yes -
and it's there yes - coconut
ultra-hydrating
melting cleanser this stuff is
unbelievable I thought I would hate it
like I love coconuts but sometimes it's
gimmicky products like this I'm like I
don't know like I'm not gonna like it
but it's like this really really thick
like petroleum jelly thick consistency
it smells wonderful like real coconuts
and there are two ways you can do it the
way I do it is you put it on dry skin so
I usually do this like after I've
already like with some Bioderma wiped
off my eye makeup I'll put this on like
a big glob all over my face and then you
get some warm water and you just start
cleansing it and it just melts like it
just melts into your skin it doesn't
really foam but it just melts the the
makeup away it smells amazing when
you're done your skin is still like
hydrated because it is that thicker
jelly-like consistency I love it I enjoy
washing my face which I don't think I've
ever said before especially in the
winter time because it's such a bad time
for virtually anyone skin you know
you're just dried out and so this just
it's amazing the other way you can do it
what does it say so you could just have
it in your hand
and get water in it and create like kind
of a creamy emulsion they said and then
put it on but I really like putting it
on dry and then doing it either way it
is just an amazing experience the next
thing so okay I have tried a lot of
natural deodorants none of them are
working I've tried like all of them and
I know you've got to wait a while for it
to kick in but I'm like I have waited
long enough I'm done I picked up I've
tried an Old Spice one and it's just the
deodorant so it doesn't have the so it's
not blocking the sweat which I like
because I don't I don't mind sweat I
just mind the smell so this is just a
deodorant and it's like the gel kind and
I wish it they didn't put like the dyes
to make it blue and like why like what
is the purpose but this is the Old Spice
amber with black currant deodorant and
oh my gosh ladies it smells amazing yes
it's a men's deodorant but it smells
unbelievable
it smells like even Tyler my husband was
like that does smell good
like I know and it smells like a woman
so no offense if they're men they'll
wear this because frankly you'd just
smell amazing but it's a very feminine
scent so it works for us ladies even
though it's a men's deodorant I love it
so much I'm so glad I found it the other
one I tried was wolf thorn and I really
liked to smell that too but I got kind
of tired of it so and then this one
smells better
honestly another favorite of mine is
this brush holder from Target and they
sell it online I actually ordered it
online a long time ago and it never came
so they had to refund my money but I
luckily found like one in the store and
I was like yes so it's the brand Sonia
Kashuk and it's the rising star brush
cup and there's two separate let me take
the brushes out there's two separate
parts to it and it's just you know
really hard plastic but it's got black
around the top and then it's these cute
like gold they're actually stars if you
look closely but from afar just looks
like really pretty gold foiling I love
it you could do you know I brush isn't
one and face brushes and the other I
love it because I will down my brush
collection a lot I have more brushes
than this but you know what I like to do
is have like one whole set that I'm
using and then every week or to watch
that entire set and use like my second
set so now that doesn't always work out
that way and actually most of these I've
been using it for way too long and I
need to wash them maybe I'll do that say
but I love the cup it's the perfect size
it helps you kind of keep in check how
many brushes you have or at least how
many brushes you're using at a time it's
so pretty
you can always get like two of them too
if you have a lot and you like to have
them display but it's it's perfect I
love it some other favorites of mine
they're both Disney one so if you're
disney not you'll love this this is from
termos and i've been wanting one of the
tourist water bottles because they're
really thick and they're not water just
corded everywhere they're not gonna
nothing's gonna happen to it I love
tourist tumblers but this is the Turkish
water bottle it snaps shut you can hang
it on things if you want I like that
there was no weird contraption you know
cuz it's like anything with the straw
like where it's like the straw holds
down on the folds up point that's hard
to clean they get broken really easily
or don't work as well after a while but
this I'm like it's really simple I can
get in there and clean it when I need to
but it's Minnie Mouse and it's so cute
and it's actually sequin if you can see
it's actually like shiny
there and it's 20 ounces so like for me
if I drink two and a half or three full
ones of these I've definitely got enough
water for the day and I love that I can
kind of measure it that way it even has
the ounces on there you can buy it on
the turpis website I actually ended up
buying mine on Amazon just because I'm a
prime member and I could get free
shipping they were the same price but
I'll link it below if you're curious I
loved it they had Mickey Mouse of course
they've got all kind you can personalize
them in a million ways it doesn't have
to be Disney but obviously I did this I
love it
I bring it to work with me every day and
I also use it here I'm just like
constantly using it my next Disney
favorites actually bought at a Half
Price Books so it's like all been up but
it's the Kingdom Keepers book series and
it's by Ridley Pearson and it's called
Kingdom Keepers Disney after dark this
is the first one in the series and I had
seen these at Disney World for so long
and I had been curious about them but
obviously they're kids books but I'm
like well whatever I'm a teacher I could
read them and then just have them in my
library and be able to recommend them to
kids that might like it I'm only on page
72 I just started in a couple days ago
but I am loving it because it's if you
know Disney World and it is specifically
Disney World but if you know Disney
World really really well like they talk
about very specific things like they're
like we're on the monorail on the way
from the Polynesian to the Grand
Floridian and or they'll mention like
very specific bathrooms and Magic
Kingdom like I love it because if you
know it you feel like you're there in a
really weird way but it's also you know
absolutely fantasy kind of sci-fi almost
but it's clearly for kids too
it's wonderful I just love it so far I
know that I'll probably read the entire
series Tyler was saying he might want to
read it because of course he's a Disney
not two so those are all my favorites
and flops for this month if you enjoyed
checking Sande flops which i can link up
above and down below as well and I hope
that you'll subscribe to catch more and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
