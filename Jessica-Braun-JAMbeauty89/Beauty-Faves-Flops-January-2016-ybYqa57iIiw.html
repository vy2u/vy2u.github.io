gonna share with you guys some of my
favorites from the month of January and
also a couple of kind of disappointing
regretful products so let's go ahead and
get into it and the queen of the
flyaways so I'm wearing some of these
things today actually I'm wearing most
of the ones that I love so that way you
could kind of get an idea of how it
looks all on a face so I'll start with
the blush that I cannot stop wearing and
I recently if you've seen my newest
drugstore haul video I can link it right
up there and down below I haul a bunch
of products from it was like the longest
ha have ever done but I hold a bunch of
boots number seven products from Target
and this was one of them so I've now
been using it technically when I fill in
the hall a while ago so I've been using
it for like two or three weeks but it's
their natural blush tint powder and soft
damson and it's just this really nice
pinkish color I mean there's it's a
matte finish I would say certainly no
shimmer yeah definitely a matte finish
but it's just simple and I'm wearing it
today and it just always looks really
nice throughout the day it never ends up
looking patchy and I just like it it's
kind of one of those everyday go two
blushes and every time I see it in my
drawer when I'm getting ready I'm like
oh yes I want to use that one so that is
why it had to be a favorite this month
what I'm wearing on my lips is a
favorite of mine this is the Revlon
Super Lustrous lip gloss in Supernatural
and you know this is you know a six or
seven dollar gloss it's just a normal
kind of glossy pink but there's
something to it that just is a little
bit deeper and I like that because I
feel like a lot of pink lip glosses can
look really like I don't know either
- Barbie pink or too bright and fuchsia
pink but this one's kind of right in
between where it looks like a fleshy
normal color I've used the word fleshy
way too much in recent
it's not even it's a such a gross work
anyway but I just love this stuff and
every time again it's another thing
where when I open my lip drawer I'm like
oh I want to use that one and every day
I'm putting this in my purse so yeah
also I just took out all the lip
products that were in my purse today and
I am embarrassed to say that there were
it's an 11 or 12 like 12 lip products in
there
12 I was like how does this happen and I
feel like I just emptied it out like a
week ago like I don't even have enough
days in the week for that many products
anyway but I bet I'm not alone I bet
some of you guys are with me where when
you grab a new lip color you just put it
in your purse and then you just never
take them out until you suddenly take
all of them out and you're like oh my
gosh I'm throwing them
so the next one's gonna be a
disappointing product and these are
these elf see I don't even know what
they're called but they're they're lip
balms I'll put the name of it right here
I recently did an alcohol as well which
I can also link but tons of new products
that are amazing but thieves I was
really excited for I got all the colors
they sent and I was an Omega I'll do a
swatch video no i swatched it on my hand
and I was like okay like it's a shear
it's right with that one right there
it's shear it's you know supposed to be
like a lip balm so it's nice
well this one was in the shade bear kiss
I tried them all they are so like pulley
when it comes to like when you're
actually applying on your lips they just
pull and pull and pull they highlight
any dry areas because they have that
little bit of pigment but it's not super
slick it's just a really weird combo
that just doesn't work together somehow
and there are plenty of other good like
tinted lip balm type products I actually
really like those um covergirl
Oh sugar ones like that almost made it
into a favorite I actually really like
those I've only tried one and all
fairness but the one I have I like it's
just simple it goes on my lips I don't
think of moisturizers like a lip balm
does like a balm that's meant to be
moisture in your lips but I think it
wears but it's out today it's more
comfortable to put on but these we're
just like dry and draggy I I wish I
hated them and you guys know I love elf
but I also tell you when the products
are
and these I think we're terrible next
favorite actually is an elf product this
is the elf crease brush I it's dirty
because I just used it powder coming up
this thing has gone with me everywhere
for like ever every time I clean brushes
and sometimes I like to swap out other
brushes this one stays in my little
brush cut back there no matter what and
it's you know a three dollar brush it's
just really thin again
domi but it's the perfect one to get
right in the crease and and then stop
and then you can get a big fluffy one
too you know kind of blend it out but
for applying it it is perfect
I've travel with its London in Paris
with me this little suckers gone
everywhere but I love it and I feel like
I need to buy a second one just so I can
kind of give this one a break but it's
so soft and it is just wonderful another
favorite is what I've been wearing in my
brows and I think I've already talked
about this in a video this is the
Maybelline brow satin or it's called the
define and fill depending apparently on
where you get it I don't know but this
is a dual ended it's got a pencil side
and then it also has this sponge that
dips into powder and what I love about
it is that the sponge is kind of pointed
so when you're applying it you you know
I'll kind of fill it in with the pencil
just a little bit especially like the
outer edges and like over here and then
I'll fill the rest in like I'm coloring
with this sponge and then if you just
take a you know a clean spoolie and just
brush through it it just ends up looking
I think better than my brows would ever
looked I don't know that they're
necessarily perfect today but um I don't
know it's just been the easiest way to
apply color to my brows it stays on all
day
the only gripe I have with it is that
when you're applying it I feel like once
you brush through like the the powder
from the sponge part you'll get little
like dots of the powder up above and
kind of around but once you wipe them
away or if you take like a big fluffy
brush this is the powder brush from Real
Techniques and just kind of brush by it
it just wipes it away and you're good to
go but that is the only thing I've
noticed that I'm like I mean if it were
perfect
wouldn't do that but you know it is what
it is this next one's a rediscovered
favorite and it's my Urban Decay Naked
palette and I remember a couple years
ago when I was I don't remember if I had
this before I started my channel or not
but I'm going on three years this year
in April and you know I just remember
saving up for this and buying it and you
know at the time my only job was
nannying so I you know I was making OK
money but not great money by any means
but I remember saving up for this and
being so excited about it and you know I
feel like now that I get to try all
kinds of products I've forgotten about
this thing that I have loved for so long
so I've been using it all month and I
use it today all I do is I'll use sin
the second one end just on the lid and
then I'll use naked all over as like a
buffer color and then buck is kind of a
newfound favorite of mine I'll just put
actually with that ELF crease brush just
in the crease and then I'll blend it out
again with that third color and naked
and then sometimes I'll throw a little
bit of half-baked just kind of on the
outer part of the lid or just kind of
spread throughout to kind of warm it up
a little bit
I love this color hustle I feel like
it's so underrated I put it just on my
lower lash line today with just like a
little sponge but anytime I'm wearing
like a dark look on my eyes like where
it's like a bluish color I'm usually
wearing gunmetal it's one of my
favorites literally every color in here
the only color I don't love is sidecar
because it is like the most gorgeous let
me swatch it it is the most gorgeous
like I don't even know what's caught
like a pewter but no it's kind of bronze
II as well but in different lights it
looks different it is beautiful but the
sparkle and it has fought everywhere
I've heard they reformulated it so I
think some of the newer naked palettes
might have the new formula of this so
I'm like oh I want to get a new palette
my no that would be ridiculous but sorry
I know it grosses some people out that I
just like lick the shadow and wipe it
off but that's just what I do never
gonna change anyway so then the next so
so this is just I love it I forgot how
much I
and that's all so I challenge you this
month February if you have a palate or
some makeup product that you have loved
and loved and loved but you've kind of
forgotten about for a while because
something newer and flashy or came out
go back to it and try it out and you
will remember you'll rekindle that old
flame let me know below what product
you're gonna kind of rekindle the flame
for because I'm just curious okay so
another favor a new product to me is the
Too Faced hangover RX primer and this
stuff is there's no silicone in it which
i think is good for my skin as I'm
learning my skin but it's got a little
pump it smells like a dream it really
smells amazing like kind of like
coconuts but kind of fruity and when you
put it on it's just so moisturizing on
your skin in the skin your skin will
just soak it up pretty quickly and then
it's ready for you to put foundation or
BB cream I've told you guys I've been
wearing BB creams a lot more lately just
to give my skin I just realize my skin
doesn't really need foundation so today
I'm just wearing a BB cream but if
you're wondering it's the dr. jart one
in the gold tube that's expensive but I
love it so much anyway but I just love
this and every time I'm reaching for a
primer I've been reaching for this one
in the maybelline one a lot let me show
you that one the other one I really like
that I feel like these are really
similar and the next time I do a dupes
video I don't know I might test these
out they're so similar but this is the
master from my face studio one that's in
the pink and it's blur and illuminate
200 or is it white kind of pinkish white
anyway these are both amazing if you
don't have the money for this try this
because I have been loving this as well
another disappointing product that I
bought and I don't know I needed a new
Jo eyeliner and I really like the mica
beauty one that I've been using but I
also like the Maybelline one and the
L'Oreal ones that those are all amazing
but I think I want to try a new one so I
bought a Sonia Kashuk one and most
products with Sonia Kashuk I love but
this one it's just they're dramatically
defining long wear gel eyeliner and it's
got kinda like this frosted glass and
it's just kind of cute well I don't love
it I'm wearing it today and I've been
wearing it most days the past week or
two but what I'm realizing is it's not
as easy to apply as some
other ones but on top of that I feel
like I have to put more layers of it on
if I'm wearing any sort of like shimmery
shade on my lid which is almost everyday
and then furthermore it kind of
transfers down to here so like I'll get
a little bit of liner down here every
hour so at work all look in the mirror
me like what so I'm like that's not a
problem I have like ever had with the
gel eyeliners I've been using the past
few years so I'm just thinking you know
I might use a little warm it up I don't
want to waste all that but at the same
time like I don't want to go through
that every day so I might end up going
and buying another one if you have a gel
liner you love high-end or drugstore let
me know down below because I'm kind of
wanting to try a new one but I also want
it to be one that's good anyway okay so
my last favorite is from colour-pop and
it's this Shay it's one of their shadows
that are like crazy and like cushiony
it's the weirdest thing if you've ever
touched them but it's in the shade
girlie and I'm kind of wearing it on my
lids today or inside it way earlier
though but this is just this really
pretty it's the one below they're like
white but it's got like this golden
gleam to it and it's not glitter there's
literally no glitter in this I don't
think at all but it's just almost this
duochrome with like white and like gold
and it is it's just beautiful it makes
me think of like if you were to take the
Mac pigment and vanilla which I also
love and own and turn it into a shadow
like this it's like the same exact color
but this is just easier to apply because
you're not worried about pigment going
everywhere and wetting a brush this just
all applies all-in-one and if you are
like for me I talked about my one of my
recent videos I don't like placing
orders online unless like I'm getting
enough things to make it worth paying
the shipping or whatever if you're
wanting to look at color pop I love this
shadow girlie but also their lip I'm not
in love with a lot of their lip products
like theirs let me six I actually didn't
love I didn't hate him but I was like
but their lip liners are incredible so
if you're wanting to maybe try a couple
of things I definitely recommend their
lip liners I have the one inbound and I
lurve it i layer it so that's another
thing I'd recommend so those for all of
my favorites and kind of some flops from
this past month hopefully you have had a
lovely January and we're all looking
forward to February it's gonna be an
awesome month and I will catch you guys
in my next video bye
my hair look looks like a microphone up
there looks like to jelly go nuts why
are they jelly I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
