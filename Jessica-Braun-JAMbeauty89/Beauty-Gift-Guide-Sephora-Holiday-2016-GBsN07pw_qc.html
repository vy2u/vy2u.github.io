the hashtags hashtag beauty together and
hashtag Sephora holiday to let me know
what you're excited about
I can't wait to share with you guys what
I've picked out for my loved ones let's
go and get into it so this very first
one is a new palette that's out and it's
by Kat Von D it's amazing I just want to
keep it for myself
it's the Kat Von D metal matte palette
this thing is honkin huge and I have
decided to gift this
I'm just gonna show it to you look at
this it's a rainbow I decided to gift it
to one of my friends that's also really
into makeup she has a blog and I know
that she likes wearing like crazy fun
funky colorful looks and that she would
absolutely love this and I know for a
fact she doesn't own it yet because it
is so new so I'm so excited I know that
she will love this this is like for the
person that just would wear any color
ever or would just die because they're
always after like that next newest
palette this is insane these next two
gifts are two separate products this is
the living proof spread cheer and
perfect hair perfect hair day trio but I
also have a full-size of the dry shampoo
so the trio comes with the dry shampoo
and the shampoo and conditioner this
line is so amazing and the dry shampoo
the reason I also have a full-size I'm
gonna give this together to my best
friend who showers twice a day because I
don't know why she showers but she
literally showers twice a day and along
she's worried about her hair being oily
she always wants it like volume eyes she
will love this set in the perfect hair
day dry shampoo is it I really think
it's the best direction PO I've ever
tried I'm like thinking through in my
head it really is this is the one that
like I splurge to buy because I love it
so much and it's so worth it it is so
amazing and these bottles seems to last
me for quite a while so I know that she
will love this as well this is also good
she's also like a fitness instructor
this would also be perfect for someone
that you know that maybe they're really
into fitness are working out but they
don't necessarily always have time to
wash their hair after they get all
sweaty dry shampoo is a savior so this
is for that person in your life alright
this next gift gotta be honest it's for
myself like 100% totally gifting to
myself because I have worked hard this
year and I deserve it this is the
hourglass it's new
I love the hourglass powders all of them
so much and I can't stop buying them but
this is the new ambient lighting edit
surreal light palette the packaging is
unbelievable it's this gorgeous marble
what I love about is that doesn't show
fingerprints at all based on what it's
made it is absolutely stunning
and it has five different shapes so I'm
gonna kind of break it down for you this
one is the finishing powder and surreal
light this is the blush and surreal glow
and this is the blush and surreal effect
and then this is the bronzer and surreal
bronze light and then this is the strobe
powder and surreal strobe light these
are all gorgeous
it's totally a gift for myself because
I've been wanting this and I'm so
excited to have it because I just love
our glass so much so if you're looking
for something maybe to add to your own
wish list for someone to get you this
would be a really good one I'm so
excited about they're so high-quality is
amazing it's got tons of different
products in it and oh my gosh it's so
pretty
this next kit I am so excited about this
is the byte little quad or it's got four
different mini lipsticks called the
perfect bite first of all the packaging
is just cute once you slide it off and
it has four different bite Beauty
lipsticks then it's so cute this is for
someone that I work with that wears the
coolest most fun lipsticks I think she's
really gonna like this because she's one
of those people like I wish I were more
like her she'll be in the middle of her
work day and she'll reapply lipstick and
I'm like oh my gosh like I wish I need
the patience I love lipstick but I don't
wear it to work as much but she does and
I totally envy her and I know that she
will love this and what's amazing about
it is that their products are really
good for your lips they're made of
amazing ingredients a lot of food great
ingredients so they're healthy for your
lips especially if you're wearing it all
day and they're really comfortable so I
know she is going to adore this so this
is perfect for someone that you know
that loves lipstick that wears it all
the time because this is so comfortable
and long wearing they will love it my
last sister is going to get this this is
this Tory Burch perfume set this scent
she is in love with perfumes like every
time I see her I'm like you smell
amazing what is that and it's a new
perfume she's just always trying new
perfumes she will love this what I like
about this scent and why I also want it
for myself I'm so selfish it smells very
floral but fresh like it's got this
citrusy but floral scent and it's just a
really cool
and also is this not like the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen in your
life but because I know she likes trying
different perfumes and she always smells
different
I noticed she's gonna like this it also
comes with a shower gel in a lotion and
she is so big on sets perfume can be a
very personal thing so you always want
to make sure it is someone that likes
perfume like my mom doesn't like perfume
so that's something I would never get
for her you know but my sister knowing
that she always smells different this is
the perfect gift for her this is for
another friend of mine this is the
Clarisonic Mia 2 limited edition set and
this is for my other friend who she's
always doing shows she's in theater
that's how I met her
and so she's always got a full face of
makeup on for all these different shows
and this is something I love the
Clarisonic because you really do feel
like your skin is really clean like I
mean really clean she's gonna love this
and I love it comes with the first day
beauty little set it's the face cleanser
the sleeping cream in there bouncy mask
she's gonna love this and because I know
she's always wearing a lot of makeup her
skin needs this and I know that she'll
totally get so much use out of this so
this is perfect for someone that you
know wears a lot of makeup or maybe
they're just really obsessed with skin
care they like all of that kind of stuff
this is an amazing gift very thoughtful
but also incredibly useful this last
gift is for my mom this is the amore
Pacific essentials collection I was torn
about whether I wanted to give this to
my mom or one of my best friends that's
all so obsessed with skincare because
it's amazing either way but my mom like
every time I get skincare that I'm
trying out she said what are you using
what what kind of eye cream is that what
she loves it so I know she would like
this you know she's got aging skin she
looks amazing oh my gosh like I pray I
tell my dad all the time I pray that my
skin looks this amazing as my mom's does
when I'm her age she's in her 60s and
she does not look like she looks like
she's in her forties it's ridiculous
so I know she will love this this is the
amore Pacific essentials collection and
it's got a cleansing foam and enzyme
peel and eye treatment gel moisture
cream a skin energy like spray it also
has these little trials of these little
cushion compacts which I know she likes
trying to
things like that so this is like she's
gonna be over the moon for this and I
cannot wait for her to finish and I
couldn't mention products I love from
Sephora and that would be amazing gifts
without mentioning these my favorite
lipstick I've ever tried in my life the
Marc Jacobs Lamarck lipsticks the sheen
I'm gonna give my cousin who loves like
dark vampy shades is this one right here
in bad behavior I think she's just gonna
love how creamy these lipsticks are and
the packaging is so ridiculously
luxurious these lipsticks are pigmented
and creamy and they last all day and
they're comfortable like it's got
everything going for it this is one of
those things that like if you're a
boyfriend or you've got a wife whatever
that you know likes lipstick and loves
beauty she would be very impressed if
you bought her this lipstick because it
is amazing it's very luxurious they're
amazing shades out there and if you
aren't sure what shade you could always
get a gift card this one is the Sephora
brush set and it is the Sephora
collection double-timed double-ended
brush set
look at how amazingly beautiful these
brushes are they have this unbelievable
gold like chunky glitter handle they're
so holiday glitz and glam I can't even
handle it it's so beautiful oh my gosh
so this is for someone that you know
like loves that glitzy glamour kind of
thing I think I'm gonna give this to one
of my sisters I have three sisters one
of mine because I know she likes that
kind of a thing and this holder is
amazing and she doesn't live nearby and
it makes me sad so I know this would be
perfect to ship to her as well but I
think she would really like this I know
she really likes makeup brushes she was
actually the one that got me on to a
couple of different makeup brushes that
I've ended up loving so she's kind of a
makeup brush snob in my opinion in the
best of ways and I know she would really
really like these so this is for her
this is the Sephora gift card and first
of all you can get them in these cute
little pouches which I'm like oh my gosh
like you could use this as a wallet as
well so if you gift it it's actually
like useful but the gift cards first of
all are beautiful and they match the
cute little like holiday packaging they
have going on with the little gems and
stuff this is for my sister that's
really hard to buy for she doesn't wear
a ton of makeup but she likes makeup and
so like every time I'm like bringing
makeup like to share with them that they
can just pick out she doesn't pick out a
lot cuz she's really picky but I think a
gift card is perfect for her because she
can you know feel like she's got choice
and she can get what she actually likes
she's a lot darker complected than I am
so like even skin type products I'm not
very good at picking out for her because
I'm not even close to her skin tone
whereas my other sister we are very
similarly like fair so I this is perfect
for her I know she's gonna be so excited
so again that's perfect for someone that
you you know they like beauty whether
it's skincare or perfume or makeup but
you really just don't know what they
like I like getting gift cards I almost
think it's in a way more thoughtful
depending on the person because some
people you're just like I don't know
what you like but I know you would like
something here a fail-safe foolproof
method of gifting so hopefully this
video was fun and helpful for you to
watch I hope you got some ideas of gifts
you could possibly get some of the
people in your life that you know love
beauty whether it's fragrance or makeup
or skincare or haircare whatever they
have so much I hope that you'll use
those hashtags mentioned earlier which
