a haul for you this video is actually
sponsored by Cosmopolitan Macy's and
Estee Lauder I am so excited to share
some of the new goodies I've got so
let's go ahead into it
also when Stefani's on the cover this
month of Cosmo and she looks beautiful
as always so one of my favorite skincare
products ever is the Estee Lauder
advanced night repair serum and this is
a product that is a cult classic for a
reason
it is amazing but every time I've ever
tried it it's been like one of those
smaller trial sizes so I use it everyday
I end up using it up so I was so excited
to finally have the full size of it and
right now Macy's is doing a free gift
with purchase for orders or purchases
over $35 you can do that at a Macy's
counter you can also do it online
through September 18th so but I liked
about this gift with purchase was that
you can completely customize your gift
so I ended up with a makeup bag filled
with free gifts so I want to share with
you guys what all came with it and what
I picked out so obviously starting with
the advanced night repair this is
amazing and this is a serum that I use
after it cleansed my face and tones make
tones that's not work after I've used
toner
I've toner toned my face what's wrong
with me anyway I like to put this serum
on right before my moisturizer and it's
just so amazing it comes with this
dropper it looks so luxurious and it
doesn't really have a scent it's just a
perfect product I love it so much so I
am so excited to continue using this it
is so so good and I know this is one
that like my mom has used before a lot
of people I know use this stuff it's
incredible so with the gift of purchase
you get this cute bag which I love the
colors it's pink is my favorite color so
for me I was like yes that's so cute
but you also get to pick out your own
charm I picked the little panda bear
he's so cute but they had a couple
choices I know they had like a monkey
and a couple other things so with the
gift with purchase no matter what you
got the bag you can pick out your charm
and all of them came with their little
perfume which is the modern Muse LaRue's
perfume and it smells really good it's
got a sweet musky smell so if you like
that kind of vanilla musk type set
I think you'd really really like this
and I think it's just so cute it's kind
of perfect for travel it fit really
easily in your liquids bag if you're
carrying on so then once you've got your
bag you picked out your charm and you've
got the perfume
there are basically two more decisions
you have to make there is a skincare duo
you can pick one of the two and then
there's also a makeup trio and you pick
one of the two trios so the skincare duo
I picked was this one here it came with
the SA Lauder day where advanced multi
protection antioxidant cream and it has
SPF of 15 I've been using this stuff
just on my face before I put my primer
and foundation on for the day I love
that it has that SPF in it because it
kind of protects your skin against the
environment when you pair it with the
advanced night repair serum this is
helping your skin at night like the
perfect duo so I really like this and
then it also came with the advanced
night repair I would have been trying it
this week but I've never tried before
and I'm so excited to have both of these
together because I feel like they're
gonna be the dynamic duo this takes care
of my eyes the serum takes care of the
rest of my face so I love this duo that
I picked out I'm so excited to use this
some more then the makeup trio I picked
out they had one they had one that had
eyes shadow and mascara and liner and I
was so torn between the two I ended up
going with the other one though because
I loved Estee Lauder blushes I remember
trying one of these a long time ago a
friend of mine had one and I was like oh
my gosh it's seitan all day it was so
beautiful so this one is the pure color
Envy sculpting blush in pink kiss and
it's just an everyday nice pink color
it's that perfect amount of pigmentation
where it's not crazy pigmented where
you're like oh my gosh I look like a
clown but it's not so light that you
can't see it I love that this was the
full-size blush and then it came with
two lip products I'm wearing the lip
gloss on my lips right now this is the
Estee Lauder pure color Envy sculpting
gloss in suggestive and it's just this
kind of nice sheer pink but it has a
little bit of shimmer to it and what I
appreciate about their formula is
there's a little bit of a light scent
but it's nothing overpowering so if
you're sensitive to scent I don't think
it will bother you at all and it's just
a really comfortable gloss it stays put
it's not too slippery Wirtz going
outside your lip line
but it's not so sticky that it drives
you nuts it's right again it's kind of
right in between so I really like this
it's comfortable and then the lipstick
of cool size lipstick that it comes with
is the pure color envy in 220 powerful
and again just a classic everyday kind
of medium pink it's not a hot pink but
it's certainly not like a light it's
just right in between where you really
look put together I feel like this would
be perfect with just like black and
white striped shirt this color pink
lipstick and then like a topknot bun I
think that would just be so pretty
honestly it's just ridiculous how much
you're getting when all you had to spend
was $35 to get all this free stuff so in
addition to all this if you spend above
$70 you'd get all this but you also have
an additional gift you can choose
between a skincare trio or a palette I
chose the skincare trio because I'm just
really getting into you know I'm 27 I've
got fine lines starting to show up and I
don't mind them obviously we all age but
at the same time I really need to be
taking care of my skin and I know that
so I was excited to try these products
out it came with this trio so first is
the Estee Lauder perfectly clean multi
action foam cleanser and purifying mask
and so I'm excited to try this this is
1.7 fluid ounces so I could travel with
it as well which I appreciate and then
this was the Estee Lauder revitalizing
supreme global anti-aging mask boost and
it says you apply this over your clean
face avoiding your eyes after five
minutes gently tissue it off use three
times a week so you don't rinse it off
you actually just kind of wipe the rest
off which I thought was really
interesting it also comes with a small
version of the advanced night repair
serum
so it's kind of perfect when I travel
which you know my husband being a travel
agent we travel a lot I can just bring
this little guy and then at home I can
have this so it's perfect I'm just
excited about all this stuff on a more
serious note just because I feel like
I'm right at that perfect age where I
really do need to start thinking
seriously about my skincare and one
thing I do feel strongly about is
finding good skincare and there are some
skincare products that are really
expensive and they're really not great
but then there are others that are just
fantastic
and a lot of people use for a reason and
I really feel like the advanced night
repair is really doing some amazing
stuff with my skin it's something I'm
thinking about buying for my sisters
maybe for Christmas because I know they
would appreciate it and love it as much
as I do so
you know that's another thing you can
think about these gifts with purchases
you could even buy someone a gift you
could use some of these as gifts there
are a lot of things you can do with it
and it's such a ridiculous deal
that's so much extra stuff just for
spending thirty five dollars which i
think is incredible so I definitely
recommend checking this stuff out even
if there's something else you're
thinking about buying from estÃ©e lauder
you know as long as it's thirty-five
dollars you can get all these gifts I've
got a link below if you want to check
this stuff out online on Macy's website
but of course you can also just go to
your local Macy's go to the Estee Lauder
counter and they are so knowledgeable
they're they'll be able to help you out
find stuff that's right for your skin
type and that you can still pick out
your gift with purchase their this gift
with purchase deal is going on until
September 18th as I mentioned earlier in
the video I will have information about
everything I spoke about down below if
you are interested in checking it out
and I'll see you guys in my next video
