to share with you guys some makeup hacks
that these are products that I feel are
so ingenious that they're basically a
hack themselves so I'm covering a wide
range of things today here in the realm
of makeup and beauty let's go ahead and
get into it so the first product hack
that I want the first product hack are
these elf brush cleansing wipes I
recently tried these out and I'm on my
last two and I need to buy some more
they're basically a single towelette you
open it they're moist obviously and you
can just clean your brushes on them so I
travel a lot even if you just you know
maybe you'll stay the night at different
places from time to time whatever it
might be sorry there flies in the room
like two flies how they got in here I
have no idea these are amazing because
you can just clean your brushes off of
them you can see like all the makeup
come off it it's crazy and then I'll
just flip it over and use the other side
for the rest of my brushes this is also
great if you typically will switch
colors using the same brush it's a
really quick way to clean it now it is a
little bit moist so if you get too much
on there it might be a little too wet to
use right away but either way these are
incredible and so genius now the company
that I'm going to talk about for my
second product tag is actually
sponsoring this video the company is
sent bird and I remember doing a video
about this a very long time ago when
they were first starting out and tons of
people know about it and use it now and
it is amazing to watch this company grow
but Sen Burt if you don't know what it
is it's 15 dollars a month and you can
cancel at any time but basically you go
through a little quiz to see what kinds
of perfumes are right for you so they
can suggest perfumes for you based on
what you like so you can choose the one
that they recommend or you can choose
from like four hundred and fifty
different perfumes I'll send you a
little velvet case and in it will be
your little tube that you will keep and
in that you twist it and that's where
the perfume is now
this is what sent to you each month you
keep this portion but you get a
different perfume each month if you'd
like the idea is that this is a 30 day
supply I think they said it's like four
spritzes a day and you can choose what
one you want the next month and I think
it's cute on their website it says you
should date a perfume before you marry
it and I thought that's that's cute
that's I mean it's exactly what it is
and I think that is such a hack because
for me when I smell a perfume in the
store you know I might spray it on
myself I might spray it on a little
piece of paper whatever and it never
quite smells the same once I finally
bite the bullet and buy a full-size
which you guys know how expensive
perfume is half of the time if not like
60% of the time I don't love it as much
as I thought I did and after like two
days of wearing it I'm like man whereas
with this I can only spend $15 and have
a whole month's use if not longer really
and know for sure if I love it enough to
buy the full size right now the scent
that I got recommended was the YSL pal
please Ian don't make fun of that I was
trying my hardest it smells really just
adult and that's what I liked about it
cuz I felt like a lot of the perfumes I
had were kind of fruity or really sweet
and I wanted something different now
they also sent me their perfume of the
month for next month so that's something
like if you want to try what they're
recommending for that month and the
perfume of the month for August is
Carvin lei parfum and this one smells
really good too they're both kind of
more adult this one says it has neroli
mandarin blossom jasmine and white
sandalwood oh my gosh so amazing they
also they have different colored ones so
this is their blue case I love it too
because you can travel with it you can
keep it in this if you want to keep it
nice small enough that it can go in your
carry-on liquids bag and last you I'm an
entire month trip if you're going if
you're lucky enough to go on a
month-long trip I also have a promo code
for scent bird so if you're interested
in that definitely check below for that
info
alright hack number three you're gonna
see I have a lot of elf hacks but
they've made so many genius things so
let's do one of them might like Holy
Grail product thing is this elf makeup
remover pen it is sim
what it sounds like it looks like a
marker like a crayola marker but it's
got makeup remover in it and I swear
these last forever as long as you like
if you wipe up some eyeliner or maybe
like you got mascara up there you can
just kind of dot it away but that little
bit of product that you get on this if
you wipe it off right away these will
stay clean forever and pro tip if you
take it out and flip it around the other
end still has makeup remover on it and
it's clean now this end is not like
chisel the way it was but it still works
so these are only like three bucks and I
get a lot of use out of these so I just
think it's genius when you're on the go
or even if you're not like for me I just
have it in my everyday makeup drawer I
have a drawer open over here turn me off
umm I keep it in my everyday makeup
drawer and it's just I swear I use it
everyday to clean up like if I do a wing
whether it's big small whatever I always
screw it up so I always need something
like this it's awesome hack number four
is this NYX product it's called NYX
proofing and it is their waterproof
eyeshadow primer I tested this in my
waterproof test video where I did a
bunch of waterproof makeup from the
drugstore I tried it out in the shower
for like two minutes to see if it
actually lasts it and everything lasted
and underneath the eyeshadow I used was
this this is amazing it taking any
eyeshadow whether it's an expensive
eyeshadow cheap doesn't really matter
and if you use this before putting it on
that eye shadow is waterproof it is I
don't know what this is but it's crazy
it totally works and it's I think around
five dollars it's just a doe foot
applicator a clear ish kind of beige
color but it's incredible so I
definitely suggest this they also have a
waterproof eyebrow primer which that I
used but I don't know if that helped or
not it was kind of odd and then they
also have a waterproofing mascara that
you put on over mascara to waterproof it
and I was like I haven't bought that yet
but that sounds genius another makeup
product hack is instead of bringing with
you a lipstick and a lip liner maybe a
gloss a couple different products for
when you go out because you put it on
and you need to touch up throughout the
day I recommend just buying some kind of
lip pencil that's thicker than a lip
liner but
quite a lipstick because sometimes
especially if it's a deeper color like a
red or a bright pink if you're using
that when you go out and you want to be
able to touch up you want a crisp line
on the outside and so you want to bring
your lip liner with you but you also
need the lipstick and more often than
not the lipstick isn't as clean as you'd
like it if you only bring that so these
kind of bridge that gap and I think
they're so genius and I keep finding
myself reaching for these every time I
go out if I want something to touch up
with so this one is the Maybelline color
blur if this is just my favorite shade
number 45 blushing and it's just a twist
up little pencil and it's just thicker
probably I don't know like five times as
thick as the lip liner but it's thin
enough that you can totally get a crisp
line with it and then the other one I
would recommend are the elf matte lip
pencils now I've done a now I've done a
swatch video with these where i swatched
a ton of them so if you're interested in
seeing how these colors look on the lips
if you're thinking about buying some
I'll link that below but this one it's
again it's about the same size this one
I haven't used as much so it's still got
its point what I do like about the elf
packaging is and again it's like a
product tack in one is there's a little
sharpener if you will it's really more
like a shaper that will taper it so
we're there to probably use it with the
maybelline one too but these are
incredible so I just think that's such a
simple cheap product heck speaking of
lips the next hack is if you want to
look a little bit more put together but
you don't necessarily have time to put
on lipstick and you don't want to worry
about if it gets all over the place or
like if you're drinking coffee like for
me on a teacher I love wearing lipstick
but I almost never wear it at work
because I don't want to have to think
about an hour and think oh is it
everywhere and I know my students will
care but I care you know what I mean
this is the answer this is the it
cosmetics genocide quoi lip balm in your
perfect pink it's literally a clear ish
balm but it just adjust to I guess the
heat on your lips and just kind of
darkens that area and it's nothing
that's super-dee-duper obvious but when
I wear it versus when I don't it there
is a difference and it really makes me
feel like okay I look a little more put
together I love this stuff elf has a
cheaper version as well that I actually
just ordered I used to have I need
another one I'll find the link for the
elf one as well because it's like way
cheaper and I'll put that in the
description box as well the next one is
from ELF
and it's their acne fighting gel now if
you react well to salicylic acid then
you will like this if you don't then you
wouldn't but what is so genius about
this product is it's got point two flu
analysis which doesn't sound like a lot
but this sucker lasts me like two years
maybe not that long maybe the year but
it's basically just a rollerball and it
just has that salicylic acid mixture in
it so when you get a pimple or maybe
just some breakouts in general I always
break out on my chin like hormonal I
literally like two days ago just took
this when I could see the breakouts I
didn't let it dry I did it like in the
morning and at night it was gone and
like a day it was incredible so this
stuff works and it's amazing and it's so
genius and again travel wise this is
perfect because you know that if
anything flares up like for me when I
travel I'm eating different foods
there's different air sometimes I'm like
then the Sun and the water this I break
out all the time and this is a lifesaver
another product tak kind of this is more
of a saving money hack I love mac
pigments I really do I don't own a lot
of Mac but pigments are something I love
I have two different sizes and my hack
is to buy the smaller size now that
sounds like well does it's like the
dumbest thing ever but the thing about
pigments is that the price difference is
like more than ten dollars in difference
I think this is like 21 or 22 and this
one's around 10 and the thing about
pigments is that you never run out of it
unless you're using a ton of this every
single day it's going to take you years
and years and years to ever run out of
these so odds are you would never need
one this size the only reason I bought
one this size it's a long story but I
was in Disney and they didn't have a
smaller size at the time so I was like
I'm just doing it because I really
really want it but I wish I'd waited
because I have this one in vanilla which
I love and it's
the perfect size I used it I think I'd
even use it on my wedding day but it's a
perfect size you can still get into it
and yet I've used tons and it's still
like literally all the way up to the lip
basically incredible and you could get
two of these for the price of one if you
wanted to try a few colors
so my last hat is speaking of Mac
instead of buying eyeshadows in the pot
buy them in the pan
they're like six dollars now for Mac and
then you can buy a cheap Z palette this
is one I got from Sephora for around ten
or twelve dollars and I just think it's
cute perfect size Mac even sells their
little palettes like their quads and
stuff for pretty cheap so even that you
could buy that in tons of shadows and
save probably still 50% because there's
so much cheaper than buying them in the
actual packaging and I know some people
like to buy them in the packaging
because they'll do pot them and then
they'll turn in the packaging the back
to Mac's stuff to get a free lipstick
but you have to get like five or six of
them and the price difference doesn't
equate to what the lipstick would be
it's actually so much cheaper even still
to just buy a lipstick and so buy the
pants so it depends on what you're
buying the showers for too because if
you know you're just buying one or two
of them and you're gonna bring those
shadows around with you and you don't
need room for a bunch then it might make
sense for you to buy it just in that
packaging I will have links and
information about all of the things I
mentioned down below if you're curious
about any of them so those are my beauty
product hacks I hope that made sense I
hope it was fun to watch it I hope you
learned something new if you did I hope
that you'll subscribe to catch more of
my videos and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
