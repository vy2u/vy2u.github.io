wanted to show you guys kind of behind
the scenes in the room that I'll be
filming in we just moved into a new
house recently and I used to vlog a
decent amount and I haven't blogged in a
while so this might not be a very long
video but I figured I'd kind of show you
guys where I'm at in the process of
moving into this room things I've got
done things that I absolutely need a
solution for maybe you guys can help me
out and just some things that you might
laugh at you might think that I'm like
somewhat professional but I'm totally
like using very interesting ways to
capture certain photos and close-ups and
stuff so I'll show you that as well and
let me flip the camera around and show
you guys - nope I'm showing behind the
scenes hi Tyler
Canton oh here - semuc there okay
Pinocchio nokia wearing away the other
day and we could not find it and it was
very scary stuff he found a part in our
fence he could sneak through getting you
don't wag your tail say it was awesome
but meet them and we have good neighbors
right pop-up - no I want to go smell
some more now you fix that part vent
okay so currently this is my setup now
I've literally been filming today so
you're really seeing it so I've got
coffee then I switched to tea and water
some lenez's products that are talking
about today so this is the first time
this set up I've got my camera and my
ring light there and this is the first
time I've had it so that I can actually
sit at my desk and film and get ready
usually in our apartment I had it back
kind of behind me so you know I wasn't
really sitting at it to do it so this
makes it way easier because I would
always have to like create an impromptu
table to use to be able to put products
on so this is so nice and this because
it's my own room I can leave these set
up all the time and it just it makes me
being able to film more often a lot more
possible so I got these these are really
really cheap light on Amazon I want to
say they were like 20 something dollars
and we bought these these are literally
Amazon basics I'm pretty inexpensive I
will link any
thing I can find down below but these
were really inexpensive lights and
what's cool is you can turn the
brightness I'm going to kind of turn it
you can turn the brightness down a tinge
and you can also it's probably hard to
see but you so I'm changing the
percentage there but while you do it you
can make the light warmer or cooler so I
think that's really really neat we
actually learned about this on set with
some people for this different project
we were working on anyway they told us
they use these really inexpensive ones
like that's amazing so it was like a
legitimate production company and a lot
of them a lot of the likes they were
using were just these really cheap slice
from Amazon so that is a much easier
thing to have and it does about the
exact same thing as those giant softbox
lights too but there's so much smaller
and cheaper so I've got two of those I
just have them plugged in they have
batteries but the batteries for out too
quickly then I have a really really
inexpensive mic here one day I'd like to
get like a really nice one that this is
a really cheap one but it's been serving
me well for a couple years and then I
have our canon t6 I t7 I I will have to
find out for my husband which it is I'm
honestly just using the kit lens we have
like four or five lenses but I almost
always use that one
ochio your ears inside out buddy I'm
using the kit lens that came with it
just because I don't know it's just
easier for me to set the settings that I
like and yeah that's just what I use but
beyond that I've got like a power strip
right there I'd love a solution for that
eventually right here I've got this
antique table my dad gave me and like a
marble cutting board and that's what
I've been doing my closest on lately and
this really cheap like light that you
hook your you put your phone here and
I've been filming my close-ups on my
phone so that way while I'm talking here
about stuff I can just set the product
to the side and just film it there these
this is just kind of like I'm using
right now because I just moved in and II
just happen to be right next to me I'm
just using these little washers to
indicate where like when my phone's up
there what would be out of the shot I
could probably just put tape or
something but it changes all the time if
i zoom in or out depending on what I'm
using so that
those are right here but yeah I've got a
giant trashcan because I go through a
lot of trash in here as I'm unboxing
things and then I have my Alex Shores
and part of it that I ruined anyway um I
got this lamp on HauteLook by the way
and I love it I'll link coatless below I
think it might still be on there but
yeah and so then I just sit here in this
chair and I got this also from HauteLook
this desk and that's pretty much that
the only new additions to my like makeup
organization I got this from Avon they
sent me a bunch of lipsticks and it has
aunt Jan beauty 89 which is my social
handle and of course the original name
of my channel and I love that so I just
I've put some new product that's got a
bunch of pretty vulgar stuff I'm trying
out to be able to do a video about but
yeah so I've got a CV over there just
sitting there we're going to mount it I
think here we used to have mounted there
I say used here we've been here a couple
weeks but we mounted it there and then I
got that lamp I got the base from a
garage sale and then the top I think I
got just from like Target or Meyer
somewhere so now I want to mount the
little because it's really small so when
it's all the way back there I can barely
see it so we might mount it there and I
just got other things I don't know where
to put them
then my closet is I've just got these
really inexpensive things I got one of
them for my birthday from my brother and
sister-in-law
I've got skincare in them so like toners
serums moisturizers etc and then this is
actually something again I bought on who
look just like our camera stuff and then
like I do to declutter I need to do
something with that this I need to
organize big time there are old softbox
lights we have like six of them and
we'll use them from time to time still
like I recently filmed in my closet so I
pulled those out but most of them we
just broke down for now until we need
them so and then I just got some mail
and stuff I need to go through things I
need to hang I don't wanna be on the
wall yet but yeah so that's the whole
setup I thought you guys might be
interested to see it I know it's
super educational other than maybe like
what equipment I use if you were
interested in that you can really make
stuff look really nice for really cheap
that is what I will say my first two
years on YouTube maybe year and a half I
just use my iPhone to film it I bought
like on Amazon like a six dollar little
tabletop holder like tripod for my phone
and I set it on top of a bunch of books
out on my floor as long as you're
filming like maybe in front of a window
you can totally pull it off and that's
all I don't like I know a lot of people
will wait like a year before they'll
start filming because like well I want
to have all the right equipment just get
started get your name out there start
getting to know people in that world and
practicing and then as you get better at
it you'll also be able to start getting
equipment and slowly but surely make it
better but you don't have to have
everything to start just get started so
I don't even know what I'm going to call
this video I hope that was helpful for
you guys to see behind the scenes and
the equipment I use I will link anything
I mentioned below if I can find it I
love you guys I hope you subscribe if
you haven't I'll see you guys soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
