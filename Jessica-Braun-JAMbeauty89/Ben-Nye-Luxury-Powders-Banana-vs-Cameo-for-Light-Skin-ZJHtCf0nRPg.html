to review the Ben Nye luxury powders and
I have cameo and I have banana these are
in packaging that I had never seen
before I see a lot of people talk about
these and they're always in the bigger
jars like the little shaker jars and I
saw that they sold these online for $12
each and I was like what because this is
more doable for me those giant ones I'm
like I'm in a million years I would
never go through this I don't think I'll
ever go through these but this was just
a little bit cheaper by a couple bucks
and I was like that makes way more sense
for me in my collection that way if I
wanted to bring this when I travel I
don't feel as crazy bringing like a
giant thing I can just bring this the
reason I wanted to make this video is
because as I was looking online for
videos and photos of these I could not
figure out for someone fair like I am
which one to get like which one actually
was better for pale pale fair skin like
mine so I'm going to show you how both
of these look when I set my under eye
concealer with each of these just so you
can get an idea of how they work so I'm
in the middle of getting ready right now
and I wanted to show you guys the
difference between these on fair skin
like I've got all I have on right now is
foundation and then some concealer I use
the NARS creamy concealer which is
pretty good but honestly where's my
other one and I like I have a video
comparing it to the NYX HD which I also
really like they look exactly the same
there are different consistency but they
give me the exact same look so if you
don't want to spend the money I would
recommend the NYX one but I can link the
comparison video of those below because
I apply one to one and one to the other
and you have to guess which one is the
expensive one anyway so I wanted to show
you I really like cameo for my skin
because it actually has a brightening
effect whereas the banana one when
you're as fair as I am it is nice
coverage I mean it does cover but you
can't it's not as brightening I guess I
should say so I'm going to do cameo on
this side and banana on that side so I
am just using this Real Techniques I
think it's called the setting brush it's
all worn off I use this thing like crazy
so I've just got a ton in there I'm just
going to tap it off and I'm just going
to lightly swirl it
in that area and not only does it
brighten the area but it kind of sets
your concealer so it doesn't move all
day so you can already see it's gotten
rid of any of the oiliness that was
there whereas you can kind of see I mean
I'm going through allergies right now so
I've got like puffy eyes and you can see
the oil and the bag there whereas here
it's a lot less noticeable now I'm going
to use the banana powder what you see I
mean just comparing them they're a
completely different color but I'm going
to use the banana powder tap it off and
I'm going to do the same thing swirl it
in that area so you see it does the same
thing where it mattifies that area it
keeps the concealer in place and it does
I think conceal a bit because for me
it's yellow compared to my skin so it
does conceal like purple tones but it
doesn't brighten the same way and I can
see them if you find it but I don't know
if it's obvious on camera but it really
is a difference in person and in my
mirror here this really is a lot lighter
than that is so if you're kind of torn
between the two I mean they're both good
but if you want more brightening I would
go with cameo but what I like about
cameo I was scared because I was like
that's really light is it going to be
too bright but it's not it's perfect
that is I would say the difference
between the two this one's brightening
this one's not on my skin tone of course
if you're a lot darker than me or deeper
than me the banana would be more
brightening any of these would be and
then they'd just be a different tone
really I am partial to the cameo one I
keep wanting to call it buff they do
have another one called buff it just in
it really honestly if you look at them
you can tell like okay obviously that
would make way more sense but I was
curious because this was yellow you know
if it would really cancel out and it
does cancel out purple tones just a
little bit it reminds me the banana one
reminds me of the bareMinerals well
rested one which I also own which is
really really nice I actually think the
bareMinerals ones has the bare minerals
one has better coverage than these but
um I really like these I find myself
using the cameo one every single day
I've had these for probably a month now
and I really do use them every single
day so the price
these is $12 I bought mine on camera
ready cosmetics calm I can link that
below they have I'm looking at the site
right now they have the four color
options so they have banana and cameo
they also have buff which is a little
bit deeper than cameo and then they also
have beige suede which is the deepest of
all of them and these are $12 for this
size they call this the dome jar and
it's 0.93 ounces they also have the one
and a half ounce small shaker which most
people have and then they have the even
taller one which is three ounces and
it's the large shaker the small shaker
is $15 so I will say if you know you're
going to use a lot you can get the small
shaker for only three dollars more and
you get like almost double what this has
I just knew I never go through it so
even though it was only a couple dollars
more I just wouldn't use it and then the
three ounce large shaker is $20 you get
taun so i guess it really if you're a
makeup artist that would make the most
sense that's the best bang for your buck
but anyway so that's where those are
sold and that's that info the packaging
on this I'm going to get this everywhere
I'm trying to make sure maybe I'll do it
with a banana so the packaging it
there's a shaker inside like there's the
little holes inside I just leave it open
because I don't typically make too much
of a mess with it and then I can just
dip my brush in it and tap it off and
we're good to go
umm I love these so much I've noticed as
I wear it throughout the day like I said
I've been wearing these off and on for
the past month um it doesn't move my
concealer looks better at the end of the
day when I've used this versus when I
don't and that would be true for any
setting powder but this is one of the
better setting powders I've tried and
there's really not really many options
at all in the drugstore I really like my
I'll show you my NYC smooth skin I've
done a demo and review of this I don't
typically use this to set my under eye
but you could and it's really good this
is in transparent and it's like three
bucks but there's not a ton of drugs for
options for under-eye setting powders so
this being twelve dollars is totally in
the drugstore range in my opinion or at
least it's closer versus like you know
all the really high-end Sephora ones
that are
expensive for what they are and you get
a lot more for that $12 price so I had a
good experience buying on camera ready
cosmetics no I'm not sponsored by them
or anything that's just I search been
nine powders and that's where I found
them and that's where I bought them um
but I would say go through them they
sell them I mean there's quite a few
different websites that sell Bandai but
I had a good experience is shipped
quickly I got it everything was perfect
so that's where I would buy it but
there's many other sites you can buy it
from hopefully this review is helpful
for you guys if you enjoy definitely
check out my other drugstore price
reviews I can make my playlist below
otherwise I hope you'll subscribe and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
