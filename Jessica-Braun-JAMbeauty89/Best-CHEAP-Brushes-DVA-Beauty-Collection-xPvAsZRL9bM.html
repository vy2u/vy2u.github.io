review of my favorite brushes ever you
guys have heard me talk about them so
freakin much it's the diva beauty
brushes now a little disclaimer at the
beginning I have never been paid from
them I have never the only thing I've
ever gotten from them is the brushes for
free to review that's it I don't have an
affiliate code I don't have a referral
like nothing so please understand that
this is a completely honest review and I
am so genuinely genuinely excited to
share these with you because it's such a
freaking good deal and I know that like
for me I don't make a lot of money I'm a
freaking teacher
so finding inexpensive brushes that are
actually really really nice is hard to
do so when these kind of came around or
came into my sphere of knowledge I
freaked out a little bit because they're
so well made I am also excited to say
that they were nice enough to give three
gift cards to you guys they're all going
to be fifty dollars each and it
obviously will be a diva Beauty gift
card and the waste center will be down
below but basically since there are
three being given away there will be
three ways to enter one will be on
Twitter one will be on Instagram and one
will be on Facebook so you have to be of
course subscribe to my channel to be
able to enter but the rules for entering
on the different social media sites will
be down below but you'll only go out to
enter once on each site so that be three
total entries you can't do it once per
day it gets a little overwhelming a
little bit so definitely check below for
the info on how to enter the giveaway
and let's go ahead and dig into all the
goodies of this brand so for an overview
of the brand they have four different
kits that they sell technically five but
one of them is a combination of both but
they also sell the brushes individually
and of course their websites below but
what I love about it is that they're
inexpensive and on top of that the
actual brushes are just so well made
another thing with the Roseville feral
they have the diva Beauty name engraved
into the ferrule so it's so nice and
then the actual words on the brush hat
it's like this prismatic chrome rainbow
effect in the words and it's just so
pretty and the actual brushes are so
soft I mean it's one of those things
that I'm like
there's so much good about this it's
very rare for me to find something bad
about these so I'm just so blown away
because these are absolutely as good if
not better than the Sigma ones and you
guys know that I'm a Sigma affiliate and
I'm not an affiliate for diva beauty so
so the basic eye kit is $17 I'm looking
down because it's I've got the ones they
pulled up the basic eye kit $17 and it
comes with these three brushes it comes
with the so7 pro Blender which i use all
the time on just to pack shadow onto the
lid it's my favorite this was one that I
was really missing another one is the
so6
tapered blender which is just a big
fluffy brush I use all the time for
crease shadow because it's just kind of
a really quick and easy application you
don't really have to think too much
about it and then there's the so5 eyes
shader which this is another one you
could use to pack lid shadow on the lid
but I also use it sometimes for a darker
color in the crease these three what I
will say about these three is when you
wash them these are the only ones that I
noticed when I wash them they were a
little more afraid than when they had
started however it's not so much this is
like the fourth time I've washed them
it's not so much
it looks more afraid before it dries on
the way once it's completely dry they
seem pretty fine so I don't know but
these were the only ones I noticed a
little bit of fraying the rest of them I
didn't notice any so that's one thing to
keep in mind now the next thing is the
buffer kit and this is very similar to
the one Sigma sells where it's basically
four different kabuki brushes it goes
for $39 that's about $10 a piece and
again you can buy these individually as
well so basically it comes with a round
top a flat top try to get these in order
on top a flat top a like rounded angled
one and then a flat angled one and so
the rounded buffer is the bo2 and all of
these I used for my foundation but I
really ended up liking the rounded one a
lot for foundation which surprised me
and then it also comes with the Bo one
flat buffer which is similar to the very
famous Sigma one which I also have and
honestly they're the same they're the
same density I think these might be
denser or more dense and I like this one
better and these are so stupid soft
so then there's the bo3 angled buffer
which is really nice and then there's
the flat angled buffer these are good
for like big areas of concealer because
they're angled you can really get in
there and it's just kind of personal
preference whether you like the rounded
or the flat but again these are so nice
another kit that they have is the
contour kit and this one runs for $30
and it comes with three different
brushes that are to aid in contouring
however I use them in a million
different ways so the first most stand
out different one is the bo5 precise
contour and this one just has a sharp
edge there it's really really dense but
it really works well at getting in there
I think this is comparable to the that
NARS one the NARS eita or Ida brush that
everyone talks about it's a little bit
different I think the NARS eita brush is
like maybe a little thinner but I mean
it's the same idea and that one's so
expensive and this one individually you
can buy or in the kit then one of the
standout favorite one think this is my
favorite brush in the entire line is the
bo six-pointed contour it's really like
soft and it's dense but still really
pliable or bendable and it just works
too so seamlessly blend out your
concealer without like actually taking
the concealer off and onto the brush it
just blends so beautifully and you could
use it a million ways you could actually
use it for contour for highlight but I
just love it for computer and then this
is the Bo seven round contour in this
one it's really it's a lot smaller but I
end up using it instead of for contour
or anything I'll either use it for
powder highlight just to get in a
specific area or I'll use it for blush
and so I can be very precise with where
I'm putting my brush my blush and brush
I just ended up liking this I traveled
with this when we went to Mackinac
Island and I ended up loving it for
blush so don't think the last kit is
their mini kit and this was a recent one
that they sent me and it comes with four
mini brushes if you will but they're
like mini kabuki brushes because they're
really dense and again Sigma sells a
very similar line but the
are so much cheaper but they let's see
it runs for $30 that already say that
and it comes with the sl1 which is the
mini flat brush and it's just just that
it's a very flat like tiny kabuki brush
then it comes with the so2 mini round
brush which is the same thing but
rounded and then let's see what's next
the so3 is the mini angled brush this is
my favorite out of this line and again
this one is awesome for concealer
because you can really get in there or
if you're spot concealing any of these
brushes are amazing if you're wanting to
contour your nose you can use these to
blend out the contour oh my gosh there's
so many ways to use these and the last
one in the line or in the yeah is the
so4 which is the mini flat angled so
again it's literally like miniature
versions of their buffer kit they're
just so cute and these were brushes that
when they said um I was like I don't
really know how I'm going to use them
but then I found like a million ways to
use them and I think I ended up
traveling with a couple of these too I
know I traveled with the so3 because
it's just so useful and again for
concealing and spot concealing perfect
so the last kit that they have which is
a combination of two kits is their diva
kit and it's 62 dollars so it's a lot
more expensive than the other ones but
it comes with the entire buffer kit and
the entire mini kit so it is a pretty
nice kit but um all of the kits are so
good and I I have a feeling they're
gonna have new products coming out I
mean I'm not for sure but but the thing
is these kind of cover so much the only
thing that I think that they're missing
would be like maybe some blush brushes
and again I've used some of these for
blush though anyway so you kind of find
a way to use them but I would say I'm
just like looking at them maybe just a
plain old powder brush a blush brush
maybe like small like eyeliner brushes
that might be nice um but I feel like
they're growing and it's really exciting
to see but they're they're so well made
I just can't get over it so definitely
check them out if you're interested
again the giveaway info is down below if
you are interested in that as well and I
will talk to you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
