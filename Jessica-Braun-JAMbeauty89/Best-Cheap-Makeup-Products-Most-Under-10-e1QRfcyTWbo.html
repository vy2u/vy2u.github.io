to share with you guys some of my
favorite products all under $10 I have
got so many products to share with you
guys that I absolutely love and I think
you need to be using right now you need
to go out and buy because they're that
good now keep in mind depending on where
you live and where you shop some of
these products might be a bit over but
all the products I'm mentioning when I
checked were under $10 at least at
drugstores near me hopefully the prices
won't vary too much but let's go ahead
and get into the video so the first
product I had to mention are these soap
&amp;amp; Glory cheek products I have two one is
called wonder bronze and these are both
these kind of wheels of shimmery
wonderment and this one of course is
bronze II and when you mix it together I
don't really wear this as a bronzer I
kind of wear it as like a peach blush
and I would say that's pretty much how
it would go on most people I think some
people with maybe deeper skin tones
could wear it as like a shimmery
highlight things like that but I really
really like this it stays on all day and
the one that I like even better is this
one called peach Party and it's more of
like a pinkish peach tone and this one I
love I'll wear this honestly it's not
that different than the Wonder bronze so
I would say out of the two I would go
with this one but it kind of depends on
your taste but they really are similar
and they give a similar look on the
cheeks but they're just beautiful
they're super shimmery I think you
really need to try it this other product
is amazing it's a Milani eyeshadow
palette it's their must-have Naturals
and these are there everyday eyes eye
shadow palettes these are incredible
they have quite a few that are really
really good so you know depending on
your preference of colors and things
like that you could pick one that would
be perfect for you but this one is
amazing because it has this matte black
that is perfect for just like powder
liner or if you just want on the outer
corner to really darken up your look I
love that they have like this beautiful
shimmery white color these do kick up
some powder but it doesn't kick up
enough that it bothers me when I'm
applying it like I don't notice that
there's like fallout all over my face um
so I really really like this all of the
palettes are amazing it's definitely
worth giving a try
this next product blew me away it's from
Katrice and they're just now recently
being sold here in the states and this
stuff is so good so it's called their
prime and fine beautifying primer and it
says that it even skin tone optically
and it gives the soft focus effect it's
naturally illuminating and I'm like yeah
we'll see about that it kind of reminds
me of like the color of calamine lotion
is that what that's called it's this
almost pink beige and it doesn't look
like there's like glitter there's no
obvious shimmer to it at all which I
really like so I've been putting it all
over my face I put it on today and it
just gives this natural glowy look
without looking shimmery in any way it
doesn't look wet like it's just the
weirdest most effective thing like I
don't really know how to explain it and
that's why I was like you know I knew I
was gonna mention this in this video
today and I was like I don't even know
how to explain what's so cool about it
it's just so good so this is one that
can find it online if you can find it at
stores that are selling Catrice near you
it is really good I have not had a
product ever high-end drugstore anything
that works like this and it's so good so
definitely worth trying this next one is
a kind of nail product it's the CND
solar oil and I was told about this when
I was getting a manicure actually I
think it was like before my wedding like
the week of my wedding and you know I
knew obviously my cuticle oils but I've
never found what I really really like
this one is so good and it's just called
they're so low oil and it smells like
let me get it um it smells like amaretto
like almonds and cherries and vanilla I
don't even know like that kind of
amazing smell and that was what first
made me love it even more but it's so
good to just wipe all over your cuticles
kind of rub in and let it soak in I
usually use this at night or right after
I've done my nails once it's dry I'll
just put it on them just to kind of
revive my cuticles after removing polish
because of course that dries it out so I
really really like it I think it's
really effective now I struggle my
cuticles like I have the terrible habit
of like picking at them when they're
just like dry um things like that so
it's really important for me to keep
them moisturize so I don't pick at them
like it's a horrible habit and I know
not alone in that so this has really
helped me I think you will really like
it and it smells my favorite lip balm I
have like I got to be honest I have like
four favorite lip balms but this is the
only one that's withstood the test of
time like I've got like two or three
right now that I absolutely adore but
this one is one that I always have on
hand as well and this is the co Bigelow
my favorite night bomb this is usually
yeah it says 750 i buy mine at Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works you can buy it online from a
few different places
just a clear lip balm really thick
smells like vanilla and it's just
amazing now it says my favorite night
balm I use it morning night it doesn't
really matter it's so so good I think
the packaging is cute and it's kind of
one of those things that I have one of
my first one of my car one of my nights
and one in here like I've just got them
everywhere I love it so much have you
been suffering with dry lips it feels it
like I would say one maybe two uses your
dry lips are gone it's amazing and I
notice that when I'm regularly using
this like every morning throughout the
day and at night when I'm regularly
using this I never have chapped lips
it's so good and I would say the day
bomb the my favorite like lip balm that
one drives my lips out this one doesn't
go figure so this is a really good
product so if you don't like fussing
with like loose powders and baking and
all that stuff and it's just too much
for you or maybe you just want something
for those days that you're not wanting
to do like full glam type looks this is
the answer this is the NYX HD finishing
powder and it's in their banana shade
now this banana shade is light enough
that it actually works if you've got
lighter skin like I do I think many
banana shades are just more yellow so
they really don't work as well for me
they work well for other people but this
one is really light and it just is
perfect to dip a little fluffy brush in
and set your under-eye you can do it
anywhere you want to lighten and
brighten your face of course it's
completely mad it's not a highlighter
it's just a finishing powder for that
but it does a great job of you know if
you've got a really tacky concealer on
and it takes a while to dry or maybe you
feel like it never really sets this is
amazing it setting it really brightening
the area it's amazing
it's not messy because it's not a loose
powder so this is one that is really
inexpensive so good and honestly this is
going to last me forever so this next
product I had to mention is a lip
product these are the L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte glosses this is another
product and I love these products that
I'm including because they're ones that
I almost can't explain because they're
so unique in their formula these are the
weirdest things I've ever tried because
they're not a gloss but they're not like
a liquid lipstick that dries down but
they're not just like a satin lipstick
they're this amazing like cream whipped
kind of formula that ends up being so
comfortable just so comfortable this
one's this pink one in three hundred
blushing ambition it's a really pretty
bright pink I also really like this
peach one and bear attraction I feel
like I keep mentioning these but it's
for a good reason they're so so good I
want to get a couple of other colors but
I love the doe foot applicator I love
the feel the formula how long they last
and like I said they're so unique so
they're definitely worth trying this
product you can find it Target and it's
the number seven brand and it's called
radiant glow concealer this stuff is so
good because you put it on you know like
on your under eye and it covers but it
also makes it glow and it blends in
seamlessly right away
like once you touch it with your finger
it blends in and that's it you don't
need brushes you don't need anything and
it I also I'm almost out I don't want to
waste it right now but like you just hit
you just hit the back it comes into the
brush and it just looks so gorgeous and
I feel like every time I wear this on my
under eye I always see compliments like
wow you look so fresh face for you looks
at you know things like that that I feel
like if the only thing different that
they were this concealer then that was
probably what it was that made me look
fresh and kind of like awake you know
it's so good there are a lot of good
drugstore concealers but this is one of
those ones that you know I just think it
does such a good job and making it look
just really nice and bright without
looking fake it looks natural and I love
it so much another product is this elf
acne fighting gel now I just filmed
today an elf best and worst video where
I talked about a ton of elf products so
I'm not going to bring too much alpha
because you'll see a ton in there
I would recommend in all of those I'm
pretty sure under $10 but this one I
actually didn't I forgot to mention in
that video it's their elf acne fighting
gel and it's salicylic acid it's just a
little rollerball and literally I had a
breakout have you ever gotten a breakout
it wasn't like a canker sore or a cold
sore but it was literally a pimple right
near the edge of my lip and those are so
painful like they look start looking
crazy so when it first started I was
like oh my gosh no and I felt it so I
grabbed this and I put a little like not
a little bit I put a lot on it and let
it dry and I left my lips alone I swear
to you I woke up this morning that was
yesterday I woke up this morning and it
is gone like it's not there there's no
bump where there was a bump it doesn't
hurt like I was like this is magic so I
love this I don't travel without it
because if you get like a random
breakout because you're tired from
traveling or the you know the
environment whatever this stuff is
amazing and it fits it takes up like no
room and your carry-on I love it ok this
is a face one this is the NYX pore
filler I actually got this in like a set
from Ulta like one of their little
drugstore kits they had for the holidays
and of course they sell this on its own
and it's still really inexpensive this
is the first primer I've ever found that
actually fills my pores but doesn't make
my skin look dry because every other one
I've tried I already have dry skin I
don't want to augment that so every
other one I've tried I'm like oh my gosh
like it just looks crazy so I had stayed
away from pore filling primers for like
two probably like two years so this is
the first one I've tried recently that I
put on my nose and I was like oh my gosh
like literally you can barely see my
pores and then when I put foundation on
top of it it just looks flawless and it
looks flawless all day whereas before I
would have you know whatever kind of
primer on my nose and I my nose it's
such a trouble spot cuz it's always red
it's always dry like I just feel like it
never looks good like even now I'm
looking in the mirror my up like it just
looks dry and but I didn't use this
today I probably should have this stuff
is so so good I was blown away and I was
prepared to hate it to be honest with
you so definitely if you are interested
in filling in pores I even put it like
up here to fill in those areas I love it
so much next favorite again took me
bicep
is this is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
now I'm wearing this on my cheeks today
so the way I apply it so that it's not
overwhelming and this by the way is in
um ice it's their shade ice I want to
get a warmer tone cuz I don't love these
cooler tone on me I don't even remember
why I bought this shade initially but
regardless it's this gorgeous ridiculous
highlight similar to like the Becca ones
because those are liquid creams liquid
creams
they're both cream products that you
kind of squeeze out and so I would just
grab any brush whether it's like a
synthetic brush or like a stipple brush
I've been using like this synthetic
brush and I've just kind of wipe it I'll
just get a little bit on the brush and
just get it in the area I want and then
just kind of usually I'll take my finger
and kind of dab around it so it doesn't
look like a strip or anything like that
but I think it looks so natural looks so
nice
if you had on a matte blush and you
wanted kind of your blush to glow you
could even do do it on top of your blush
I just feel like this formula is really
nice for a drugstore I don't think you
need to go spend the money I love the
Becca one and like I would buy it all
over again but now knowing that this is
out there and it's literally the exact
same thing just maybe a different shade
I don't know if I would I don't know
because this is really as good so
definitely check it out I think they
have like 2 or 3 shades of this and I
love it alright so another lip product
that I love this is the Burt's Bees lip
stick but it's not really like a
lipstick lipstick it's in blush Basin
and first of all I think the packaging
is cute and it's just lipstick shaped I
mean it is a lipstick but it's just
comfortable and I feel like I'm doing
something good for my lips when I put it
on because I presume Burt's Bees uses
more natural ingredients but it always
feels comfortable it never looks weird
as I'm wearing it throughout the day it
kind of wears off nicely
um I think it's got a lot of pigment but
it's not like BAM in your face like NARS
audacious lipsticks it's kind of just
like a step under that but I really love
this color they have a lot of different
shades and I feel like again no one's
really talking about this and they're so
so good so definitely find a shade you
might like look up swatches online and
just try one because I think you're
going to be really impressed and this is
one of those
that literally lives in my purse I had
to go get it out of my purse for this
video next product is this l'oreal
infallible shadow these have been around
for a while now and again they have tons
of shades but this is the one i go back
to over and over and over again it's a
perfect dupe for the mac pigment and tan
that's like a best-seller people use
like crazy celebrities use it this is
the exact same thing exact I have a dupe
video where I talked about a ton of
really expensive makeup products and
then what I found is exact dupes for it
in the drugstore for way way cheaper
I'll link that video below is really
proud of it this was one of them in
there and um it is the exact same thing
so it's a loose powder that's kind of
pressed in um but it's this unbelievable
oh my gosh unbelievable shimmery bronzy
lovely thing again every time I wear
this on my eyelids people are like what
are you wearing on your eyelid so I'm
like let me tell you about this stuff
because it's amazing it's so gorgeous
I'm telling you it looks exactly like
the Mac one you don't need to spend the
money I think the packaging this is even
better because it's not messy because
it's got that wider mouth to actually
dip into whereas the Mac pigments
whether it's the small or the bigger
size you know it's not as easy to use
this is so much less messy easier to
travel with etc so those are all of the
under $10 products I would recommend let
me know if you've tried any of these how
you like them if there's another shade I
should try in some of these and of
course I would love to read your
