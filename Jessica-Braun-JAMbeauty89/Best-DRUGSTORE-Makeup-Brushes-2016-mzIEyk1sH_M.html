going to share with you some of my
favorite drugstore brushes I've got some
face brushes some eye brushes these are
all ones honestly most of these are
dirty because I use them every single
day so let's go ahead and get into it so
the first brush that I had to mention is
a newbie to my collection but it quickly
became my favorite blush brush I've ever
owned ever and it is the Sonia Kashuk
number 29 brush now I will say the Sonia
Kashuk brushes are a little bit more
expensive than the other ones I'm going
to mention there like they can range
from like 10 to 20 dollars depending on
what kind of brush and how big it is but
honestly you guys they're just so good I
had to so much and then plus you can get
them at Target which is kind of
drugstore you know anyway this one is
perfectly round and it's tapered just
enough that when you get powder blush on
it it just applies it so perfectly where
you want it's never too much in one spot
it diffuses it perfectly I don't know
like I feel like there's so many
different blush brush shapes that I've
never settled on one that I was like
that's just right for my face but for
some reason this one is exactly what I
needed and the handle is really like
kind of ergonomic like it's really easy
to hold and comfortable to hold the
other one I'm going to mention is the
number two brush by Sonia Kashuk and
it's very very very similar but it's
just a little bit pinched in so this one
I've actually been using just to kind of
lightly contour and even to bronze up
here because it's not so big that I'm
getting wrong zaroor contour powder
everywhere but it's big enough that it
kind of again diffuses it really really
well so it's not a really harsh line if
you want a harsh line this might not be
the brush you want board but I love
these so so much I want to get all of
them so some more face brushes these
next few are from Real Techniques this
one is their powder brush and it's just
huge and fluffy I mean it's as big as
like my forehead here my nose whatever
they're amazing they're really really
sturdy and well made you can tell they
can stand upright which can be kind of
cool
at the same time it's big so when you
put it like in a brush Cup or something
it kind of takes up a lot of room for no
reason which kind of is annoying but
that's kind of slight like that doesn't
really matter but anyway again it's
really really soft these I had this one
for probably three or four years oh my
gosh if not more I don't know for a long
long time and it has withstood
everything like it has blasted so many
washes they don't shed these are
incredible brushes so I love this one
another favorite is their what is it
actually called their expert face brush
and I actually own more than one of
these because I love them this they're
incredibly ridiculously soft this is
perfect for applying foundation or
concealer it's so good with cream
products kind of that synthetic feel to
it but you can actually get out like
when you're cleaning this brush you can
actually get all the foundation out I
feel like I own so many foundation eat
tight brushes that when I try and clean
it no matter how long I'm cleaning it I
just can't get all the foundation out
this one go gets perfectly clean and
again this one I feel like I've had for
like two or three years but it's just
it's just soft enough that it buffs
things in so beautifully and it's kind
of the one I reach for I travel with
every time I'm traveling because I know
that it can do not only my foundation
but also concealer here it just blends
it so seamlessly and it's small enough
to get in there but big enough to still
cover your face pretty quickly so I love
that another this kind of a random brush
favorite it's kind of eyes but it's for
like I use it to set my under eyes so
it's for like concealer powder type
things um and I think it's literally
worn off I've used so much I think it's
called their setting brush I'll have all
of this stuff listed and linked below
but it's again really small but it's
really tapered very fluffy and soft and
it's just the perfect thing to dip into
like like I use today the bare minerals
well rested powder and that's a really
really heavy powder but it does such a
good job of blending it so it looks
flawless but you can also use you know
translucent powders whatever you can
take it down on the bridge of your nose
get your fill trim I mean there's so
much you can do with this it is lovely
now I think it is too big to do like
your eyes probably but I love it the
last one's going to mention I have one
more face and then a bunch of eye ones
these are by Elle
and oh I feel like their brushes can be
hit or miss sometimes they can be
incredible like um like the ones I'm
gonna mention and some of them are just
kind of like mmm
so hit or miss but I would say more
often than not they're pretty awesome
now their studio line of course is their
better line of brushes versus their
professionals but this one is their elf
again it doesn't say it I think it's
just a powder brush this one has been
around for quite a while youtubers have
raved about this brush it's crazy soft
like a flat top kabuki type brush it's
great for cream foundation but I
actually like to use it this is one that
after a while if you use it with cream
foundation it's really hard to get clean
and even when you do it's like messed up
the consistency of the brush so for
three dollars I usually at that point
but just buy a new one because it's been
like a year so but I actually like this
for mineral foundation or baking because
with those really finely milled powders
you can really get this flat top in
it'll hold on to it and just place it
where you want it and let it sit or you
know wherever you're putting it it
really is good for that just packing on
powder and then of course you'll need to
dust it away probably but I love it for
that so if you've never tried it for
that you like to use mineral powders or
maybe you do like the baking technique
which is different but it's really good
for eye brushes I've got two from the
studio line one of them is the elf
blending brush and this one has a lot of
surface area so it's really good at
packing on colors on the lid or you can
just write under your brow bone just to
kind of get some lighter color up there
well maybe not I don't really use it for
that I usually just use it to Pat color
on the lid but it's thin enough this way
that you could actually get in the
crease with it too so it's totally a
multitasker the other one is my favorite
eye brush of all time I have used it
every day since I've owned it every day
every day it is the elf crease brush and
it is thin but really soft so you can
get um you know whatever color in and it
goes right in your crease perfectly
exactly where you want it it doesn't
spread out too much then you can take a
fluffier brush to kind of blend the
edges but this is incredible I need to
own a couple because I'm always using
this one and I always need to clean it
and then I
you were too dry you know this next one
is the professional line it's their
defining I brush and I have had like
four of these because I love them it is
angled and really really thin and its
really soft for they're cheaper brushes
it's still really soft and I like this
for my lower lash line like if I'm just
kind of smoking something out or it's
really good you know it's a little bit
big but you can still do like your inner
corner with it or just to get your outer
corner of your eye because it's really
um tight so you can get a dark color and
place it exactly precisely where you
want it and then blend it out a little
bit but the last one I'm gonna mention
kind of ties in with this one this is
their elf professional smudge eye sponge
and it's I mean honestly you can get it
from any brand this is just the one I
have but this eye sponge is just you
know kind of circular and I love just
getting a darker color I use it today
and just doing my outer corner with this
and just kind of smudging it out so it's
not as harsh it's just the perfect tool
for that again this is another brush I
travel with everywhere because I use it
all the time you could put liner if you
will like shadow liner on your upper
lash line you could use it for a ton but
I love it and it just hit me that I
pencil that I love the define and fill
from Maybelline I love it because it's a
sponge like this that is in like a brow
powder and then I kind of put it on my
brows I'm just now connecting that I
could totally use this in a brow powder
and see if that works just as well I
might try that because I love this so
those were all my drugstore brush picks
that I love I have loved for a very long
time some of these I've bought more than
once other ones have just lasted me so
long I haven't needed to I hope this
