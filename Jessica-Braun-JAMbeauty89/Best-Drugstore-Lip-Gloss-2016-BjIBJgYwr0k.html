going to share with you guys my top 5
favorite drugstore lip glosses i used
some follies videos Fast Five I haven't
decided if I'm still going to call it
that or not but it is my top 5 drugstore
lip glosses so let's go ahead and get
into it I've raised these from number
five to number one let's go ahead and
start with number five so out of the
five it's my least favorite even though
it's still favorite it's favorite anyway
can anyone name that comedian that I was
talking about gray cheery OH
whoo blues favorite anyway I just
butchered it if you know that but anyway
okay moving on this is the NYC liquid
lip shine in Brighton Beach peach and
this one has a very strong smell kind of
like a coconutty vanilla II I can't
really describe the smell maybe not
coconut very strong smell so if you're
sensitive to smells you won't like this
one but I love this shade because this
is beautiful peach that's got this
beautiful shimmery kind of golden shift
to it and it just makes your lips look
really dimensional and a little bit
fuller and if you have smaller lips
you'd really really like this so and I
like it's just comfortable to wear my
number four pick is the boots number
seven lip gloss a in the shade
marshmallow I have to look really hard
for where the title was marshmallow and
it's just it's in a squeezy tube it's
the only one of my favorites it's in a
squeezy tube but I just like it because
it's comfortable and I this is actually
a recent addition for me but I really
like it's a sheer wash but it does have
a little bit of a pink tint
I think marshmallow isn't really good
name for it actually it kind of has a
sweet smell but it's nothing super
alarming like the NYC one is but I just
I really liked the way this made my lips
feel the way it made them look you can
wear this on top of anything you can
wear it alone on top of bright lipstick
starter lipsticks nude lipsticks it
doesn't really matter and that's what I
like about it this is one of those
foolproof purse lip glosses that you can
throw in and know you could wear in any
way you need
kind of just pull your look together my
number three choice are the Revlon Super
Lustrous lip glosses and I have two one
of them that I love is called
supernatural and it's just this really
normal kind of pinkish but it's a little
bit of a deeper pink color and these are
just the most classic lip glosses to me
they have so many shades the other one I
really like is Skyy pink which I've
mentioned in my cheap dupes video where
I mentioned a ton of cheap products that
are like cheap versions of really
expensive famous products I can link
that above and below if you are curious
I loved doing that video but this one is
kind of a dupe for the NARS Turkish
Delight lip gloss but Kim Kardashian
apparently used to love it's just these
are really comfortable again all of
these are comfortable to wear but they
just
you can pick colors intentionally so
with these since they do have a nice
color range you can really pair the
colors with the lipstick you're going to
wear to make them go perfectly together
and I really like that and I just like
the formulas and I think the packaging
is really just simple and beautiful and
like classic my number two and this was
a toss-up between number two and number
one but I ended up going with this is
number two is my NYX mega shine lip
gloss in the shade beige and it's
actually a pink color and the packaging
has a cute little bow on the lid it's
just cute all of these except for the
boots number seven one has a have a doe
foot applicator but this one really does
have a lot of color it also however has
a really strong smell which is why I
couldn't make it number one but this
might be my favorite formula out of any
of them and they again have a huge shade
range but the smell is like cherries and
it's really really strong so if you
don't like that or if you're sensitive
to smells you will hate this but this
shade of pink for my coloring is the
perfect everyday pink it doesn't look
bright it doesn't look Barbie like it's
not too light it is perfect it's just
perfect I this is the only lip gloss I
have bought more than once this is my
second one bought more than once that is
so rare obviously my number one drumroll
please
is the Rimmel stay glossy lip gloss and
I can't believe like the packaging is
kind of like mmm like its kind of cute
it's got the silver it's got the little
Rimmel crown on the top kind of cheesy
but I kind of love it there are two
shades I love so not that glamorous one
that I like it's a another peachy shade
it's a little lighter than the NYC
liquid lip shine and not I don't know
it's really kind of golden but it looks
gorgeous over like a brown nude lip
which is why I love it but my number one
is in the shade blushing Belle graves
and it is like a kind of grayish pink is
how I always describe it the perfect
nude you don't need it with anything it
is the most beautiful color on its own I
love it so much this is the one that
every time I opened my drawer that has
my lip glosses I declared so much so I
don't have that much but it's always my
number one grab like I always grab it
and throw up my purse because it goes
with everything it looks so put together
but it could also look really fun it
could go really great with the smokey
eye but it could also go great with just
a neutral look I mean it's it's perfect
it's literally the perfect lip gloss and
these don't really have a smell at all
so I like that as well so hopefully that
was fun for you to watch I certainly
enjoy talking about all of my favorites
I've done tons of like lately I've done
a lot of like products I didn't like
videos and like I just did the products
that company sent me that I hated video
which I can link below so it's also nice
to talk with products I love which is
what this is so if you enjoyed stay
tuned for more of my top 5 drugstore
category videos and I will see you guys
in my next one bye
can't refined like random stray hairs
stuck like through the fiber of your
clothing that you're like what and it
pulls and it's like been sown in it like
blows my mind sometimes how deeply
rooted a hair of mine will be and I know
that grows to some people out but I
can't be alone in that it's just so
weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
