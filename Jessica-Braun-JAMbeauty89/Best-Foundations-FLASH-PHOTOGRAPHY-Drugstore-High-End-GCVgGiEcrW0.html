bringing you my top 5 foundations for
photographs and this is so important if
you are about to get married or maybe
you're just in a wedding or maybe you're
going to prom or homecoming important
dance an important work event a
Christmas party whatever it might be or
maybe you're just getting your photos
taken for headshots if you're an actor
or something like that
it's really important your foundation is
your face I mean your eyes are important
but you can't really go wrong with a lot
of different eye shadows but with
foundation that's like everything and
that's the base for you know your blush
and everything and on top of that if
you're using flash photography which
most photographers do for certain events
you want to make sure that it is exactly
right for those photos so you don't look
like a ghost or anything like that so if
you are interested in learning more
about my top 5 stay tuned so the number
one thing you want to make sure before
you pick any foundation for photographs
is that it does not have a really high
level of SPF and that is because with
certain SPF it can cause flashbacks so
what I would recommend is just avoid SPF
altogether for the event you know there
are certain types where like oh this
kind of sunscreen is okay as long as
it's not this kind I would say just
steer clear if you're not a professional
when it comes to that I'm not either so
I just steer clear completely so all 5
of these I have worn in flash
photography I know they perform
beautifully they don't have that white
cast and be aware that whatever
moisturizer you put on under your
foundation might have SPF as well so
double-check that if you're wearing
moisturizer underneath that it does not
have any sunscreen that goes the same
for primer as well the primer I love is
this Rimmel lasting finished primer it's
really really cheap I actually just
filmed today as well my like top
drugstore primer video and this is my
number one because it is moisturizing it
gives your skin kind of the satin finish
to it it doesn't look really really dry
and matte but it also doesn't look
really really oily but on top of that it
actually holds on to your foundation all
days so this is one that I love and I
would recommend there are lots of great
primers but this is my favorite now
let's work through this I have three
high end and two drug stores
I love drugstore makeup and that's I
mean you guys know that about me so I
always offer drugstore options but these
drugs are options are ones that I would
wear over the high-end ones I mean
they're just amazing so I actually have
a demo of me applying one of these
drugstore ones that I'll show you here
in a second but let's kind of count down
here
my number five top foundation is the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation this one
I love the packaging it's really cute
and it's got a pump which is really
really nice however this one is just
beautiful on your skin it just kind of
perfects it it's got pretty good
coverage I would say when I wear this I
don't really need a second layer of it
but sometimes I will like my nose is
always red so sometimes I'll put it on
top of my nose more than once but it's a
beautiful foundation it blends really
easily it doesn't have SPF of course and
it's just gorgeous it feels really nice
on your skin really satiny um I think
that if you have really really oily skin
though it might break through on your
skin a little bit so for me I found that
it it worked fine because I have combo
skin but I think if you have really
really oily skin this might not provide
as much mattifying coverage as you might
need now you can still wear this and
just put maybe a powder foundation on
top or a loose setting powder to help
control the oil but it really is a
beautiful foundation and it has really
nice coverage
next in line is one that everyone raves
about and I bought it for my wedding and
I wore it kind of in conjunction with
another foundation I'll mention this is
the Make Up For Ever HD foundation this
one was just reformulated to be the
Ultra HD and I don't know if there's a
huge difference so I will talk about
this long but to be honest with you it's
nice but I don't think it's any better
than the other drugstore ones I'm going
to mention so I don't think it's worth
spending the ridiculous amount of money
on honestly these two are both really
good but again the drugstore ones
address is good but this one again has a
pump it's a it's a kind of thin formula
that you you know you blended and it
feels nice to be honest I feel like I
should reorder because I almost feel
like the born this way I like a little
bit more than this one but this one's
just so highly revered I think if you
have really oily skin this one might
work a little bit better because I do
feel like it's a little bit more
mattifying you can almost tell on my
skin it's just like a flat whereas the
other was a little more satiny um it
kind of depends on your skin type but
that's all I'll say about that because
it was reformulated and I don't know a
lot about the new formulation and how I
think they're really really similar but
I'm not for sure
the next one minute mentioned is one of
my favorites this is the gorgeous
cosmetics base perfect liquid foundation
this one again has a pump this one's
even more expensive though it is just I
don't know what it is about this
foundation I'll apply it down here but
it just this one's a lot darker than my
skin right now works kind of on my face
though um but it's just it leaves the
perfect satin finish it's got the
perfect amount of coverage but it
doesn't feel like you're wearing any
foundation it's kind of the weirdest
thing the other two I feel like I'm
wearing foundation which that's not that
big of a deal if you're being
photographed I mean I don't mind
feeling like I'm wearing makeup but this
one just works for everyday it works for
photos it's just beautiful it does have
a smell though that I think might bother
people it's kind of a perfume e musky
smell so if you know that would bother
you then stay away because it is kind of
a strong smell but I think this is
absolutely beautiful this is a line that
I know the Kardashians like that's what
I've heard anyway the gorgeous cosmetics
um it's just beautiful on the skin for
everyday but this is a really hefty
price tag so let's talk about my two
real favorites the drugstore ones
um so my number two is the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation this is
actually too light for me right now I've
got you know our skin fluctuates in
color throughout the year so this is one
I wear more when it's winter time but
this is in 102 shell beige this it's a
squeezy foundation and it's just it is
amazing coverage it's very very matte
however now for me I don't love a very
matte look but if you do or you have
really oily skin you will love this
foundation what I will say is I'm having
trouble finding one that's more yellow
tone for my skin so if you've got more
of a rosy tone you'd probably have a
really good look but for me I'm that's
where I'm struggling finding the right
shade because they're either way too
dark or they're way too rosy I haven't
found a really nice yellow lighter ish
shade for me but the formula is
absolutely amazing um it really is
amazing and when this came out people
lost their minds but for good reason
because it's one of the first drugstore
foundations that are crazy high coverage
comparable to the Make Up For Ever HD or
the tube I mean any of them but it's so
much cheaper so absolutely amazing
especially if you have oily skin
now my number one that I'm going to show
you a demo on is the Revlon Colorstay
whipped
I love the Revlon Colorstay but that one
has a little bit of SPF so I don't risk
it but this one has no SPF at all what
stinks is that the packaging is a glass
jar and it I mean anything that then a
jar reads bacteria so for this after
I've had it for a few months I typically
buy a new one just cuz I don't know you
know you're dipping your finger into it
or your brush or whatever you can use
like a little scoop to get it out but
you either even still air is getting
into it every time air and light so just
something to keep in mind but it is one
of my favorites I wore this in parts of
my face for my wedding I kind of did
both the makeup forever hello to be
honest I don't really remember exactly
what I wore my wedding day but I made my
video a while back so I think I mix this
with the Make Up For Ever HD or maybe I
don't remember but if you're interested
in all the makeup I wore on my wedding
I'll link it below because I have a
whole video on every single thing broken
down that I wore because I did my own
makeup which was very nerve-wracking but
exciting anyway this foundation is a
thicker foundation which I love because
if you've got any like weird say weird
because I've got some like I've got a
pimple right now right there but I'm
wearing it today and this just it's the
most beautiful it's like thicker but it
like it's like a whipped gel formula
that's the best way now this is a little
light for my skin right now I had to
bronze it up a little bit but it is the
most beautiful satin finish I think it
is gorgeous and photos because it makes
you look like you're glowing from within
but not shiny now I've got highlighter
on so if you're saying like mm your face
looks shiny that might be why but I
think it is the most beautiful
foundation I've ever tried this has been
one that I've loved ever since it came
out years ago I just constantly have it
my collection and I constantly reach for
it I travel with this even in a stupid
giant heavy glass jar
I still love traveling with it because
it is so amazing so let's get into if
you're really interested in how
this particular foundation works let's
get into the demo of the applying as you
can kind of see how I use it and how it
looks when you apply it to the skin
okay so I out of all of my options here
I'm going to apply the Revlon Colorstay
because it's the most affordable out of
all the options but it's also just one
of my favorites I've tried a lot of
high-end foundations and this is just
one of my favorites so I wanted to prove
to you guys that these drugstore
foundations really can do just as well
as any super-dee-duper expensive
foundation so I just kind of patted it
everywhere I'm using a real techniques
brush called their expert face brush
this one I think runs around $10 and
it's worth every penny and it lasts
through like a million washes so I'm
just going to start at the center of my
nose and just kind of lightly blend it
start into the center of my face and
blending out
wanted to show you the coverage of this
I have a pimple right there that's kind
of healing really it's now just a dark
spot it covered it pretty well with just
one layer and I also always have a red
nose right now I'm cold in the room I'm
filming in but my nose is just always
red so it's something I battle all the
time but this is a pretty good job with
one-pass and covering it but you can
still see a little bit and you can still
see a little bit of pigmentation so I am
just going to do just one other full
layer and what's nice is depending on
your own skin you know you know as you
look in the mirror if you need more
maybe you only need that one layer but
with something that says inexpensive is
this I don't mind doing another layer if
I need now on a normal day basis I don't
do a full second layer I might do a
little more of my nose but I usually
just wear one but if you're going to be
in photos and you want to look flawless
I would say a second layer this won't
hurt just again make sure you get the
right shade not that one I'm wearing for
my skin tone what I love about this
foundation now that I look like a ghost
is that um it just it feels and looks
very satiny so you can still see there's
a natural glow coming through my skin
but it didn't add that glow it's kind of
what was already there and it just kind
of makes it look even nicer if you're
really oily you'd want to set this with
a nice powder I really like the NYC
translucent powder I take the little
sifter out of it and you can just kind
of set it on there let it sit and then
dust it off or you could use like I love
the Rimmel stay matte powder even if
you're not as oily this is one of my
favorites because it mattifies enough
but not too much where you look like
like a porcelain doll but it provides
coverage it is it leaves a nice satin
look to your face which i think is
beautiful in photographs but there's
always the option of making it look more
matte but what's nice is it doesn't dry
my skin out so as you can see I clearly
love that foundation any of these you'd
be good with so if you've got like a
sephora gift card you're wanting to
splurge on a nice foundation any of
these foundations that were expensive
are really really nice but I really
honestly love these even
more than those and I find myself
reaching for these more than those the
only exception would be this gorgeous
one I love and I reach for all the time
however it's so expensive that this is
not one I don't think for any of these i
wouldn't repurchase them once i use them
up because I like them and I'll use them
but I kind of see that that was a lot of
money spent for things that I mean I can
kind of do at the drugstore you know
what I'm saying hopefully this review

me know what else you'd be interested in
