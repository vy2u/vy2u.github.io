video I've been filming for a while huh
but I was like I gotta get this video up
so this is my Ipsy bag my Ipsy unbagging
for this month of June and it's the end
of June but I just got back in town and
I finally got it be month this month
what the theme this month is rebel rebel
a rebel rebel rebel rebel which is pit
got graffiti all over it which is kind
of fun I feel ridiculously goofy today
so let's wouldn't dig in so the first
thing oh if you don't know these are 10
if you're watching this video if you
don't know about if see yet that's just
crazy to me but it is $10 a month so the
first item in here is from soap &amp;amp; Glory
and it is their face soap and clarity
vitamin C facial wash
I almost said watch which makes me think
of people that say wash instead of wash
my mom does my mom do that anymore I
know she's from Mississippi and I know
my grandma did or like Washington
instead of wash or what was another one
I don't remember pillar instead of
pillow
did any of you guys do that I think it's
the cutest thing in the world anyway um
so vitamin C facial wash and it's their
three-in-one daily detox I wonder if it
smells good
oh is it closed a lot of their products
smell incredible soap in glory is really
growing on me a lot and I know they're
kind of newer to the state it just
smells like aloe vera to be honest with
you guys but it smells really clean it
reminds me of hotels for some reason so
that's something that I'll definitely
use and if I don't use just in my daily
routine I would use when I travel it
just seems like a simple easy to use
face wash the next thing in here is this
delectable but I don't know what the
brand or the name of the type everything
balm everything mom it plumps pout pout
seal split ends glosses softens heals
lips taints brows conditions cuticles
pops cheekbones brightens dark circles
nourishes dryness and it's in the scent
I guess sweet cream so it sounds like
it's just something moisturizing you can
use anywhere kind of like if you think
about like petroleum jelly whoo it
smells oh my gosh it smells like
raspberries
and it's just a clear bomb so you can
use it for all of that this okay I'm
looking for a new like kind of cuticle
type cream but honestly this would be
perfect in your bedside for your
cuticles for your lips before you like
go to bed just do all of it this is
awesome and it smells incredible and I
would love to be smelling that as I fall
asleep so this is gonna move right to my
nightstand the next thing in here is
this Seraphine botanicals happy a
biscuit natural blush it's vegan GMO
free gluten free looks like a really
small one but the packaging is so cute
let's see oh it looks deeper kind of
like a coppery tone it almost blends in
with my skin perfectly with my finger
skin look how pretty that is though it's
just it's got a little bit of shimmer to
it but not like glitter it's just got
like a sheen like a satin finish I
should say it's really really pretty to
be honest it doesn't have a smell I just
in case you were curious alright next
thing is from the balm and it's meet
matrimony matte like matte eyeshadow um
it's in marriage matte Tyrael said it
okay oh it's like a really deep purple
I've had one of the I don't think it was
the meet matte ones their shadows are
ridiculously pigmented that I'm just
kind of swatching out but like if you
just look at a finger so I mean they
really are amazing they blend pretty
well but I always feel like their
palettes for me and what I like are
never a good combination for me but I
know a lot of people love them and the
shadows are good quality so I know the
ball is on HauteLook all the time the
last thing in here is from colour-pop
it's well what is it I don't know it oh
it's there cream gel liner I have
dropped so many things tonight and get
paid get money get pay I figured it
would be blue based on like the
packaging weight wrong it's like a
beautiful like copper penny oh my gosh
it's like this ridiculous it looks like
a brand new penny oh my gosh
that is gorgeous
that I am so drawn to this color right
now I you'll see in my mac Hall if you
haven't seen it I don't know if it's up
yet I'll link it below when it's up but
I bought a Paint Pot that looks similar
to this
I am so drawn to this color right now so
I am really excited about that oh my
gosh so for $10 you got the bag which is
okay it's cute but it's not totally my
style but that's alright this liner
which I will definitely use this blush
which i think is so I just dumped my
nail in it which is so pretty and kind
of a different color than what I usually
buy so I really like both of those it's
got this shadow which is really good
this is the color I would like to use on
my lower lash line for like every day so
that's nice
you got this facial wash from soap &amp;amp;
Glory you also got this everything bomb
from delectable so that's not bad like I
feel like that's actually one of the
best if C bags I've ever gotten so I
mean for ten dollars I feel like I would
have bought just this and this it made
even this I am very impressed that woman
box boxycharm and fat fit fun and try
the world from time to time although we
usually do that on my husband's Channel
um most Ryan box on my channel Oh

the time anyway I do a lot of unboxings
