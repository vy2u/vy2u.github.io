gonna share with you guys some of the
things that I think you have got to try
from Sephora the vib sale is here it's
ongoing of all the info of like the
dates of the exact sale these are all
the things that I bought from Sephora
that I adore and as I went through my
collection picked these things out I
thought these are things that I feel
like almost everyone would absolutely
love so everything will be listed in
linked below let's go ahead and get into
it I'm doing this video kind of in place
of my March favorites this year because
these really are kind of some of my
favorites and I figure I'm already like
deep into April I might as well just put
this up now and just sorry sorry March
favourites I'll get back to you another
year so the first thing I would
recommend is my favorite mascara of all
time and I actually need to repurchase
it myself so I'll probably repurchase it
now it is the Lancome Hypnose drama
mascara now this you know the packaging
is kind of simple black but there's
something about it's got kind of a big
brush like a natural bristle brush but
it's a little bit of a curve but there's
something about the formula and the
brush together that makes your lashes
stay curled volumize and black and that
is all I ever asked for they don't like
clump up and look weird they just look
amazing there have been quite a few
times when I've been wearing this that
people both at work and outside of work
have asked like are you wearing fake
lashes and I'm like no but do say it
again like it is the best best best
mascara really and what I've noticed
with this is it takes about a week for
it to be perfect so like it needs a
little bit of air and it's kind of dry
it out just a little bit but once it's
hit that point I use this for probably
two and a half three months but it also
needs like more than one coat so I'll
usually put a coat on wait about 30 to
45 seconds then put another coat on
that's everyday like two coats if it's
like I'm going out and I want to look
extra bloom I'll usually do
three coats so if you have the time to
do a couple coats that's when this
really shines because it doesn't clump
up with more coats
it just looks even better every time I
mean it it's like one of the few
mascaras that it doesn't clump up as I
put a little bit more it clumps I guess
I should say it but it doesn't clump it
just it's six together just enough to
make it look beautiful
but not so much that it looks clumping
your spidery it's like the perfect
middle ground I love it if you're
wondering what I'm wearing on my lips by
the way it's just a drugstore lipstick
that I love it's the Revlon Super
Lustrous lipstick in pink in the
afternoon I love it now it looks a
little deeper on my lips because my lips
are just naturally more pigmented I
think I'm most people I'll swatch it
here it would look a little more warm
toned cuz I'm a weirdo so it doesn't
quite look the same on mine but I still
love this lipstick but of course you
can't buy that at Sephora so go to Ulta
or a drugstore for that one but I love
it so much and if you're new to my
channel I talk about drugstore quite
often so for me that's like I just love
this lipstick it's one of my favorites
but anyway another thing I would
recommend from Sephora are the dr. jart
BB beauty bombs I have two and I love
both I brought these are amazing for
beach vacations out of the pool whatever
where you don't want to look just like
no makeup so if you're trying to like
maybe impress a little bit you want one
of these where it kind of evens out your
skin tone but it also has SPF so this
one is the my original one and it has
SPF of 45 it's kind of got a gray tone
to it but it messes with your skin so
perfectly that the gray doesn't really
matter and that's what I like about so
it's not like high coverage at all so
don't think it's going to be anything
like that it cosmetics BB cream that one
really is more like a foundation this
one has a lot more skin benefits and
it's actually really good for your skin
anyway I love this one it's SPF 45 this
one has SPF of 25 and it's their Black
Label detox now I don't think it
actually detoxes at all but it's again a
very similar consistency coverage I
haven't really known
the difference to be honest other than
just a difference in SPF so I own both
because this one was almost gone so I
ordered this one and now I just kind of
got both but I like them another thing I
would recommend is this NARS blush now I
had bought the NARS orgasm blush a long
time ago and I was so let down because
it has this reddish pull to it
where if you already have what kind of
hyperpigmentation like I do it just
makes your cheeks look really red really
weird to be honest it doesn't look like
you put blush on on purpose it looks
like your teacher just read just read
and so this one is in the shade deep
throat and it's this it's kind of what I
had wished that would have been and so
if you've got kind of a skin tone like
mine or maybe you're a little bit
lighter or you're more prone to redness
this one is this really pretty pink but
kind of peachy and definitely has a
shimmer to it blush and of course these
blushes really are nice I don't think
they swatch is pretty on the hand as
they do with a brush on your cheeks
because that's the way they're meant to
be applied but even still I think it's
so beautiful and these do lasts all day
another thing I would recommend another
blush which is very different than that
one is the benefit Dallas blush nobody
talks about this and I don't really know
why because I've had I think I've
literally owned all of the benefit
blushes not and through all of my
declares I've done here on YouTube I
still have like all of my benefit
blushes except for rocket or anything
like that one because I love them so
much but this is I think my favorite
because it's kind of this brown tone and
even though I'm semi like kind of fair
kind of light this still looks gorgeous
it's this kind of peachy Brown and when
you swatch it it's like really like do
you really like that but it blends so
perfectly and it looks so perfect on the
skin it's again on that same vein it's
like what I had hoped the Tarte
exposed blush would look like on me but
this looks way better
so again if you're fair like I am or
like light or you have the same skin
type as I do you would probably like
this better than Tarte exposed because I
liked that one but I in the end got rid
of it because I didn't wear it
much whereas this I pull for all the
time and it's the exact same blush as
that one I think it just blends a little
bit better it looks more soft on the
cheeks and it can like make you look a
little bit bronzy without pulling too
peach or too pink or too Brown it's just
right in between all three the thing I
loved and I didn't think I would love
because I thought it was kind of
gimmicky and I was like I'm gonna try it
anyway
and so I ordered it and there was like I
love this it is the Too Faced hangover
RX or hangover apps whatever you want to
call it replenishing face primer okay
well I like the packaging is just cute
which is why it really that's why I want
it the first place but when you take it
off it's a pump which I also loved it
smells amazing which is not necessarily
great for skin care because they say
that fragrance really doesn't belong on
your face because it can be an irritant
this hasn't irritated me so far but if
you are sensitive to fragrance you might
be irritated by it but if you're not
this is just like this like almost
watery lotion that just feels good and
it feels good before I put on anything
on my face today I am wearing the it
cosmetics
I'll show you because I'm doing the
video today as well the it cosmetics CC
plus illumination um BB cream kind of
it's really more of a foundation um but
I like this a lot and I really like it
over this because it's like moisture
plus illumination is just like healthy
skin in my head so I just like this it's
really good under mattifying foundations
if you're trying to use one up I just
realized I just don't like matte skin on
myself I used to love it and then I've
quickly realized that it just makes me
look older than I really am I'm 27 which
is not old by any means but you know
when I've got dry skin already or if I
have dry skin
matte things matte primers matte
anything just makes me look really dull
and lifeless and kind of old and so I
realized I'm like I've got to stay away
from that because I don't like the way
my skin looks with it anyway it just
doesn't look healthy
so today
I really like the way my skin looks and
this is what I'm wearing I really really
like this so it's one of those things
that if you have oily skin you would
hate I really don't think you would like
it it's not gonna work for you at all
but if you have dry skin or even just
normal skin or maybe you're aging and
you want to look a little more youth
youthful you would like this you knew I
had to mention these and I'm I'll talk
about them quickly
they are the Marc Jacobs la creme
lipsticks these are dumb expensive dumb
dumb one of them I bought when I was in
Paris and I can link the Sephora haul
that I did from there because I'm pretty
sure everything I bought that Sephora
you can buy here in the states too there
might be one or two things but so if
you're curious but this is one I bought
this but I bought another shade too
these are so expensive but this is the
if you ever see me wearing a red
lipstick I'm wearing this and really
honestly in like 50% of my videos I'm
wearing this this is called Oh Miley and
it is this ridiculous creamy
ridiculously creamy red lipstick it's
like more cool tone it looks perfect
but I also got the shade infamous and
it's more of a like everyday wearable
color although it is a little bit deeper
than when I saw it online that I thought
it was but I still really like it it's
kind of similar what I'm wearing on my
lips today maybe a little bit more
opaque but I really like these they're
so creamy they say on all day they're
comfortable they're moisturizing they're
thick like it's so many weird things
together I love them so much they're so
expensive but honestly you guys I tried
two different types of YSL lipsticks
I've gotten rid of really almost all of
them these are so much better and I
think they're about the same price these
might be a little bit cheaper I feel
like no again no one talks about them
maybe I'm crazy so this is something I'm
almost out of that's how much I love
this this is the tarte maracuja
creaseless concealer this was bought on
a whim one day when I was in a Sephora
like in a JCPenney far away from my home
the whole day was weird I remember but I
bought this because I was so intrigued
by it wearing it today I love this stuff
so much when you just feel well for me
like when I'm filming
I like to wear this but even when you
just feel like you want to look extra
like fresh right under there you just
maybe you do have a lot of dark circles
to conceal this stuff is amazing now
when you look at it up close like I
obviously got my mirror here when you
look at it up close it's not completely
invisible so don't feel like you're
gonna put this on and it's going to
blend perfectly into your skin but from
you know I'm probably 2 and 1/2 feet
away from the camera right now it's not
super obvious is it so I mean and even
in real life you can totally get away
with this and it still looks pretty nice
so I just love it and I was thinking as
I was using it today and I was like oh
my gosh like it's almost gone that's
kind of exciting I was like do I want to
buy this again and I was like maybe I
really really like it so I think I will
buy it again actually I would recommend
is this is the benefit they're real
mascara but it's their tinted primer
this is new I bought it on the Birchbox
website because they always have like
free gifts with purchase and when the
free gifts on the Birchbox website are
better than sephora's i usually buy it
on the Birchbox site anyway but it's the
classic um spoolie that the their real
mascara has but it's a brown tinted
primer now I think this is just really
cool because I've used a lot of primers
that I'm like they're just bad or have
used mascara primers that are white and
they start to show through throughout
the day when I put a black mascara over
them but this being Brown is perfect
because it holds lashes up it kind of
volumizes them before you even put a
mascara on at all so like in the
mascaras mind it's like yeah I'm just
covering lashes but the primer has made
your lashes even bigger so it makes your
lashes after the mascara even bigger
which is what I really like about them
and they really do work when you find a
good one
so I love the fact that it's brown so
even throughout the day if the mascara
starts wearing off weird you don't see
like a white primer shining through or
sometimes we need for the block mascara
over the white your lashes look kind of
blue which I don't really love on myself
so this has eliminated that possibility
and I just really honestly I was
impressed
I thought I would be like hmm I actually
really liked it I would recommend it so
the last thing I recommend is an old
standby of mine this is the Too Faced
natural eyes palette this is $36 and
I've actually done a dupe video a year
or two ago where I found and it's still
available at Walmart and $8 was at 8:06
a really cheap dupe for this buy hard
candy I no longer have that just because
I had both and they were so similar and
I was like well I've spent more on this
and they're both the same I might as
well keep the more expensive one but
that one was so amazing and if you
haven't seen that video I will link it
like seriously you really can't save
your money if you haven't bought this
yet but I had already bought it so I was
like that anyway it is the perfect
palette because it's got enough matte
shadow it's got a dark brown matte a
medium brown a white to go like under
your eyebrow if you want that's how I
use it but then it's also got another
warmer tone medium brown and then it's
got enough shimmery shades like they've
got darker ones medium ones and then a
beautiful like champagne color it
literally is exactly what I use every
day and it's the only palette I've ever
found that has all of it like literally
the only palette I've ever found and
it's insane to me
that more companies don't come out with
palettes like this because I mean they
do but like the fact that it's got these
two like lighter matte Brown type shades
to buff and blend in between I don't
know why more palettes don't have that a
lot of pouts are missing that and I'm
like you have to have that shade to
blend together darker or brighter tones
you just have to and so I don't I don't
get it but anyway I love this palette it
is like my old standby I've had it
forever and I use it every week at least
once or twice and I travel with it quite
often as well so those are all of my
recommendations for the support sale I
know a lot of those are kind of like
cult classics some of them are just kind
of random ones that no one talks about
hopefully it was helpful for you guys
and I'm hopefully you'll subscribe to
catch more and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye he and it just it's perfect
and not only that am I saying yeah I
feel like I'm Shelby right now I just
got it all over myself
