going to share my drugstore powder
collection I've been doing my kind of
drugstore collections I don't know why I
put that in quotes it's it's drugstore
but my drugstore collections of
different parts of my whole makeup
collection so I've done drugstore
bronzers drugstore foundations have I
done drugstore primers if I haven't I
should do that soon anyway but basically
what I'm trying to do is show you guys
the parts of my collection in our
drugstore compare all of them tell you
guys which ones I really think are
amazing regardless of the fact that
they're cheaper than their just amazing
even compared to high-end virgins versus
ones that maybe you should pass on or
ones that are kind of meth and I love
filming these kinds of videos I will
have all of the prices of every single
product I mentioned as well as all of
the products listed in the order I
mentioned them down below so if you have
a question about the price of them what
shades they have etc if you enjoyed the
style of video definitely check out my
other drugstore collection videos I will
link all that I've done below as well I
hope you'll subscribe let's go and get
into it okay you're not a little thirsty
today by the way I bought a three pack
of these at Target because I used to
have like a turban one but like I never
like I didn't wash it as much as I
should have I know how gross that sounds
and like the straws got weird and I
don't know so finally I just bought like
for five dollars it was a three pack of
these like plastic I mean they're like
legitimately a cup you can throw them in
the dishwasher and so then I figured you
know if I can throw every pieces in the
dishwasher make sure it's clean and then
if it ever like gets totally ruined or I
lose a piece it doesn't matter because
it was a three pack for like five
dollars I was just tired of buying like
$20 $25 like water cups and they either
break or they're harder to clean and I'm
like whatever so I'm so glad I bought
these they'd all say just do you sassy
so huge side track so the first powder
I'm gonna mention is the Rimmel
insta-fix and matte translucent powder
this is one of those kind of white
powders but it claims to be translucent
because when you blend it in of course
you can't see it but the thing about
white powders like
while yes they do soak up oil they
really do I just feel like you're better
off if you really don't want a powdery
cakey look don't get a white powder like
I don't really know unless you're
wanting to like brighten in which case
you wouldn't necessarily want this one
you'd probably want a loose white powder
or something like that but for the
pressed format I mean for example
another one I'm going to mention is the
same brand Rimmel but it's there stay
matte line where it soaks up the matte
I've been talking a lot today it soaks
up the oil but it doesn't necessarily
leave a white cast so I would say out of
these two they both do the same thing I
just like the Rimmel stay matte better
now I think it's cute that there's a
bunch of hashtags on and I mean they're
clearly you know kind of going with the
trends of today's youth but I just think
that the other ones have better powder I
do wish that these stay matte powder
this is like the 80th one I've had of
this I've used this since I was in
Middle School alright gosh a long time
ago at least high school I remember
using this in shows and things like that
and it just does such a great job of
soaking up the oil now this is not like
a high coverage powder although actually
that looked like it kicked up a lot more
than I remember anyway this is actually
a new one I recently bought a new one
but I have it in the shade 0:04
sandstorm which seems to do pretty well
they do not have a large shade range at
all but I would say if these were going
head-to-head I would go for the same
amount every single time I just wish
they would redo the packaging so the lid
doesn't just come off another powder
that's kind of newer to my collection
from the drugstore is from Milani it's
their prep set glow illuminating
transparent powder this stuff is amazing
and it is very very reminiscent like
probably a perfect dupe for I need to
like actually compare them side-by-side
at some point to the hourglass powder in
ambient light oh wait no it's ambient
lighting powder in dim light that's what
it is I use that all of the time when I
don't really want a super matte face but
I just need to like tone down just a
little bit of the shine but I still want
to look glowy
that's the powder
for because I can put it everywhere and
it doesn't have shimmer but there's
something about it that's just a little
bit illuminating and this is the exact
same way I don't know how to describe it
it just looks like there's always like a
dim light on your skin like you're just
kind of lit from within but you're not
shiny and I love that about that powder
and this powder I already almost hit pan
and I just recently got this however I
do think that this is a really shallow
pan in some way because I feel like I
remember hitting it and I was like what
like I've only used this not that many
times anyway but I have it in the shade
zero two and it's perfect for my skin
tone if you're looking for that kind of
an hourglass ambient lighting powder try
them a lot anyone you will be you'll be
in love just put it everywhere and you
just look beautiful it's just perfected
the next powder is from one wild it's
their photo focus feel like I'm yelling
calm down just there right there
the wet-and-wild photo focused pressed
powder now this I got in warm light
again not a huge shake range which is
true for a lot of the super budget
drugstore lines which is unfortunate but
the idea behind this is that there's no
photo flash back and I do agree now I
think a lot of these don't have photo
flash back but it's nice that they
advertise that so if you were like in a
pinch and you needed one you know maybe
there's a special event you forgot
powder you can run to the store get this
for like 399 or whatever it is and you
know you will have photo flash back um
it's a domed powder it's actually
surprisingly soft like incredibly soft I
did a wet and wild best and worst of
like the entire wet and wild line and I
will link that below if you want to see
it I don't know if I had this at that
point or not either way this is a great
powder it is a great powder and not even
just if you're on a budget it's just a
really creamy thin layer of powder where
I don't think it looks super cakey
provides a little bit of coverage not
really but the way I've been using this
a lot it's just something under eye I'll
just toss it there and I feel like it
brightens the area just a bit I'm kind
of curious to get an even lighter color
and try it because I like that it's such
a thin layer of powder but pleasantly
surprised okay the next one is another
one this might be probably top 3
favorite drugstore powder foundations
this is the NYX no filter powder they
call it a finishing powder I would call
it a powder foundation because it has
fantastic coverage it's so creamy on the
skin I don't know how to explain it
I've even taken this and like if I have
something special going on at night and
I put on a foundation and it looks
pretty good but I really want to amp it
up and look perfect I'll take this and a
wet Beauty Blender and just on I only do
it on like side of it just in case it
ever like ruined it by putting you know
like liquid in it but what Beauty
Blender and I dab it onto here and I dab
that onto my face and I swear to you it
is the most flawless finish especially
like on your nose if you have problems
on your nose this is great with the wet
Beauty Blender just get it in there dab
it on your nose and it's flawless it is
amazing and it stays in place it is so
cool so I highly recommend this one I
don't feel like too many people are
talking about it and they should be
because it is great I feel like I don't
have a lot of negative things to say
about these products but they're they're
just good there are a few that I'm kind
of about that are coming up but I I've
decluttered a lot of products that I
knew you know I didn't like and so there
are only a few that I'm kind of about X
is the Physicians Formula youthful wear
this is another top three products
powder products from the drugstore it's
a powder foundation I haven't in the
illuminating finish no Jessica you broke
it you ding-dong well not totally but I
definitely kind of broke apart I've been
it back too far now it can't lift up the
thing I mean I guess I can just do that
and I never use the brush below but
anyway but it does come with a mirror on
the bottom I literally never even pull
this out and then like a actually it
kind of thick brush so you could get in
there and reapply but this stuff is
increase incredible it reminds me of
like totally do polishes
for the it cosmetics one that I love
it's like the it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination powder
foundation I hate the name anyway really
really good of course Physicians Formula
is always a little bit more expensive in
the drugstore so it
this can retail for $12.99 thirty-nine I
mean it always creeps up so wait for a
sale but this is a really good one this
one does have a hint of glimmer to it as
well kind of like the Milani prep set
glow but this one has a lot more
coverage than this this is not
necessarily a coverage foundation or
powder this one really does have some
coverage to it it smells so clean not
like soap it smells like sweet clean I
love the smell and every time like I
always use a fluffy brush with it and
every time I use it I just love smelling
the brush it smells like clean hair that
sounds really gross but it does I guess
it's not gross it's weird
anyway I love this stuff if you've been
watching my channel a while you know I
already love this I do want to try the
matte finish though did I already say
that or did I think it because I'm just
curious how different is the formula
because I know a lot of you guys have
not been able to find the illuminating
finish you can only find the matte
finish in the only way you know I was
holding that literally in front of my
face the only way you would know which
it is is there's like a small sticker on
the actual box it comes in that says it
like in the corner illuminating finish
your matte finish and then it says it on
the back so it is kind of hard to find
but it's great next up is another new
one it's the covergirl advance radiance
powder not new to the drugstore new to
me and this one I'd heard raved about a
ton my biggest gripe with it I think the
packaging is actually really cute it's
classic covergirl packaging so it makes
me think of my mom but it's got like
kind of a more iridescent top to it
which is really pretty it's got a mirror
it's got its classic little puffs with a
silver top but it got those weird
granules really quickly and that just
bothers me I don't think it's that big
of a deal I just got it but it does pack
quite a punch I've heard of some people
doing this like on their under eye it is
really pretty that way I do feel like it
starts to look cakey the more you put on
whereas a lot of
other thinner powders don't do that but
this one does but I still think it's a
beautiful found powder I keep saying
foundation it is really really pretty so
if you're looking for one that's kind of
middle-of-the-road it's got great
coverage
it definitely mattifies but it's not
like $13.99 like the Physicians Formula
one i do think you'd like this if you
just want a powder for your under eye
this is also pretty for that it's really
brightening you could use it just to
highlight certain areas not like glitter
highlight but like true highlight next
is oh my gosh this is probably top three
as well so is that three I've got my
Physicians Formula this one and the what
was the other one I said oh the next one
it's the Maybelline better skin no one's
talking about this and is so amazing it
I love it I always usually keep this I
always usually I usually keep this in my
purse
because it's nice and thin it has a huge
mirror and it has one of those puffs
that's actually really good at really
getting the product and you can apply it
wherever because this is one of those
things that if I ever am trying a
foundation or I'm wearing something and
I look in the mirror halfway through the
day and I'm like oh my gosh your skin
looks crazier it's not it doesn't have
enough coverage I can just grab this and
dab it on and it looks so beautiful
so beautiful I think a lot of people are
turned off by it because maybe because
of the packaging because a lot of people
don't like when this is there it's a lot
bigger than it needs to be but I
actually really like this for on-the-go
and I just love it I really do and
sometimes I forget about because it's
always in my purse so when I'm doing
videos and thinking about favorites I'm
looking at stuff that's around me like
in my everyday makeup Jordan stuff I
don't think to look at my purse but I
could list this as a favorite every
single month I really really like this
so if you are just looking burn
all-around great powder great for
touch-ups definitely give it a try oh
and the big thing I forgot to mention
the reason it's called they're better
skin line it's got salicylic acid in it
which is for some skin types can be
great at battling acne for some that
doesn't work you know it's just kind of
one of those things but so it's not
necessarily bad for your skin either
which I appreciate so when you're piling
it on you don't have to feel like you're
absolutely
wrecking your skin and just clogging
your pores next this is kind of a weird
one to include but I wanted to mention
it it's from NYX it's their HD finishing
powder in banana now I've tried like the
Ben Nye banana powder that's really
famous it's just not right for someone
my skin tone if you've got a deeper
maybe more olive skin tone it's great
and really brightening for me it just
wasn't super brightening because it was
almost dark for me if that makes sense
so I've since gotten rid of that but
this is a very very light yellowish
white shade and I love this for setting
my under eye I used it today I use it
all the time because it's quicker for me
to grab this and swirl a brush in it and
just set my under eye and brighten that
area than it is for me to get like a
loose powder and do all that so most
days if I'm doing that this is what I'm
using I've been using it for probably a
year now I love it just as much as I did
then as I do now and I haven't tried
like other tones of this if you have and
you have one you'd recommend let me know
I've only tried the banana but I really
love it for that and it's super
inexpensive and I am never gonna run out
of this especially since that's all I'm
using it for now we're getting into some
loose powders this is the NYC smooth
skin loose powder this is a very famous
loose powder very similar to like the
Cody airspun I mean for all I know they
could be the same product but the Cody
one has like a smell to it that I very
much associated with that this one is oh
that's right it has a sifter you can
take the sifter out the old one I used
to have I took it out because it was
almost less messy in that way I don't
know it's just so messy
it's so so messy but it's a good loose
powder it it's one of my top two
favorite I have four here I want to show
you and it's one of my favorites because
it's not stark white again it's that
same thing that when I'm putting stuff
on my face I want it to look as natural
as possible and even though I am a
little bit fair the white just I feel
like it doesn't look good I think we're
kind of all moving beyond that we're
wanting to look a little bit more
natural and with that in mind the white
is just not natural even if you have
fair skin so for me this has more of a
beige tone
to it and for my skintone I think it's
beautiful now it's translucent so
technically it blends away but I think
you guys get what I'm saying the tone of
it is just a little bit different it
soaks up oil like that you can bake with
it if you want you can do anything with
it and it's so so cheap I just wish it
weren't as messy like for example let me
show you what I wish like cover effects
of course this is not a drugstore but I
wanted to show you the example they have
finally figured it out where they have
it but you lift up so that you can
access the sifter so there's not just
loose powder everywhere I mean this is
like the most genius contraption ever
and I I can't wait till eventually
drugstores kind of figure it out find a
way to get it going in their factories
and start using that kind of a packaging
because I so so appreciate this thank
you cover FX yum abou so anyway like
look at this just to shut it powder
everywhere so I don't like to use it for
that reason so either I needed to pot it
into something else and that's true for
a lot of these or I don't know so for
that reason it's a great product I just
wish it were repackaged alright just
embrace the dust everywhere Jessica you
can clean it a little bit the next one
is from hard candy which is sold at
Walmart it's they're fast and fabulous
translucent loose powder this is a white
powder it is not bad but I feel like
it's one of those things that you might
as well be using cornstarch do you know
what I mean I mean it's super finely
milled like you like touch it and your
hand goes super finely milled I just
feel like it's super white and it really
comes across that way
some white powders are better I'll show
you one in a minute that's better than
this at blending away to actually be
translucent this just sticks that white
now it is an amazing option if you want
like the super white kind of under-eye
this would be fantastic because it
definitely leaves behind that white cast
for that reason I don't like it but I
know for that reason other people do
like it so that's something to keep in
mind so I guess what I'm saying is it's
not bad but you would need it for a very
specific purpose I don't think that it's
an all-around good
next is an old Holy Grail this is from
number seven I bought it at Target it's
their perfect light loose powder again
it's just like the NYC but the packaging
is better it's the same idea where it's
translucent but it's more of a baiji
tone instead of a white so it looks a
lot more natural I like it as a puff and
that is why it holds in the powder so I
can do this and powder it's not coming
out but I also like it because I can
really quickly if I want to dab it in
certain areas I can do that and then
I'll grab like a fluffy brush and just
kind of brush it away and then it soaks
with the oil that I needed it to soak up
so for that reason I just think this is
a great powder
I think the NYC and this one are very
similar formula wise I just think that
because of the packaging it's worth
spending a couple extra dollars on this
because you're gonna want to use it more
does that make sense
it's amazing how inconvenient it really
can be to the point where I I can't even
tell you the last time I open this
because of that but beyond that it
really the number seven one really is a
good product probably one of my top
setting powders even out of my high-end
ones it's really really good it reminds
me actually a lot of the coverfx one in
a way all right next up I actually have
two more I thought I only had four total
I have five this one's from pixie so it
can be a little bit pricier at Target
but it's their quick fix powder I had to
show cuz it's so cool so you open this
up and it has this puff that's actually
you don't take it off or anything like
that
actually there we go you don't take it
off it's a part of it and you dab it on
and you actually can dab it right onto
your face I'm just showing you on my arm
so you can dab it where you want it so
for me sometimes the way I'll use it is
if I do like a contour blush kind of
thing I'll use this right here to kind
of just get that area a little bit
cleaned up and I feel like it does such
a great job of kind of cleaning it up
and then I can brush and blend and it
just does a good job or if I just need
that right in my t-zone
I can do the same thing I think that is
such a cool packaging idea yet again it
has a little mirror on the top I don't
know how often you'd use it but
it's a really cool idea now again it is
a white powder but I and what I might do
I think that I could take it off and
when I run out of this I might refill it
with like maybe maybe with the NYC stuff
so I can still use it but have a beige
powder with it so I wish the pixi one
sold it with a more beige toned
translucent powder okay last but not
least is the flower beauty giant honkin
miracle mattes translucent finishing
powder flower beauty they're sold at
Walmart it's true Barrymore's line their
packaging is gorgeous it is so well
thought out always kind of on trend yet
still classic and pretty and romantic
they always have beautiful like gold
bronzy kind of pieces to it
this is humongous it is truly humongous
kind of difficult to get off but again
what's nice is it has that puff and the
powder is a little bit deeper in there
with the sifter so it's a little bit
less messy now this is a white
translucent powder I think that it's
just it's just a standard white
translucent it's not bad but it's
nothing that like makes me use it and go
so if you're dying to try flower beauty
I don't think this is bad it definitely
has cool packaging so if you're really
into it for that and you just need a
standard setting powder this will do the
job it's not bad but I just don't think
it's anything that great that you need
to run out and get so those are all of
my drugstore powders and powder
foundations and loose powders I have a
lot I love a lot obviously this was not
a video full of worse but I did have a
few that just I didn't think are worth
running out and buying but I plenty that
I absolutely love like I said earlier I
hope you'll subscribe I hope you check
out more of my drugstore collection
videos which are linked below other than
that I'll see you guys in my next one
