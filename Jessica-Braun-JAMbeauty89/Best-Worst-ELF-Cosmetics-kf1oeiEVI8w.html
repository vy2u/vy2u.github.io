going to share with you guys the best
and the worst of elf cosmetics I've done
a couple of these in the past and I go
through elf makeup like crazy I feel
like when I go through their website I'm
like I literally feel like I tried all
of this so I have some standby favorite
products that I've loved for years that
I've either repurchase or they've sent
to me again and I'm just like sweet a
new one because my old one is gone or
it's products that are newer that I am
totally in love with but I also have of
course products that I don't like now
I'm gonna try not to do too many repeats
of products that I don't like from ELF
because I've already talked about those
in my past
elf best and worst videos so if you're
interested in seeing some more products
you might want to avoid from the company
I will link those past videos below
other than that I hope that you'll
subscribe if you like seeing videos on
affordable makeup I do affordable makeup
I also do some higher-end
I kind of do just a mix of it so if you
like that I would love if you would
subscribe let's start with their brushes
I feel like elf brushes don't get enough
love and they're amazing and really good
brushes can be really hard to find
especially in the drugstore so I have
three brushes that I want to mention one
is their highlighting brush now what I
love about this is the shape it's one of
those shapes that you can so perfectly
get it where you want it but you could
also use it for other things you could
use it for like maybe a contour type
think you could bronze with it you could
put blush on with it it is just an
amazing shape it really it's really
easily I don't know it's just so easy to
use
honestly I have not reached for a
different highlighting brush since I've
had this so it's kind of one of those
things that that for me tells me
everything I need to know about how
amazing it is the next brush is their
elf giant powder brush and I'll put the
actual name of it down below but it's
just this huge super fluffy brush I love
that it's got this clear kind of fun
handle it's so good you could apply
powder foundation regular powder you
could apply bronzer with it you can
apply anything you want I've even done
it with like loose powder but it's just
one of those brushes that again essence
I've owned this I don't reach for any
other powder brush it's just the right
size it's just the right you know feel
to it it's really really soft and it
just does a really good job and the last
brush of theirs I'm in love with right
now is this elf
the shadow brush and I'll put again I'll
put the name of it because it doesn't
say it on the handle but what I love
about this is clearly super synthetic
which I usually the way this is made
feels almost like rubbery I wouldn't
usually go for this kind of a brush
however I've been using it to put on
light shadow just on my brow bone right
under my brow and I've been able to do
get such a crisp line with it I love it
so I literally only use it for that
reason but I love it for that reason all
right let's move on to face products so
one primer that I love of theirs is this
moisturizing one it's from their
beautifully bare line if I'm correct and
it's just super moisturizing I like that
it's smaller packaging really simple but
if you have dry skin this is one of
those primers that just it's just a
white primer and of course eventually as
transparent as you rub it in it's so
soft it just has kind of a nice clean
smell it does have a smell though so if
you're sensitive to smell it might
bother you but it's just really soft it
makes your skin feel it kind of has that
silicone feel but in a moisturizing way
a lot of silicone type primers for me do
not work well with my dry skin but this
one does and I don't even know it
doesn't have the ingredient I'm not even
sure if it has silicon in it but it has
that kind of feel but its moisturizing
it makes my skin look so smooth even
when my skin is super dry if you've
watched my snapchats lately I've been
talking about how dry my skin has been
and what I've tried to kind of combat it
anyway but I really like this stuff it's
definitely worth it if you have dry skin
they're my favorite foundation not just
out of elfs products but out of all
products out of all high end out of all
drugstore right now this is my absolute
favorite it's the elf flawless finish
foundation oh my gosh I don't know where
the stuff is hiding it's been out for a
while but I didn't try it until this
year it's got a pump which I love the
packaging is just nice it's like glass
really nice packaging and I'm in the
shade by the way sand which is a perfect
match for my skin although I am looking
quite a bit paler but um it just blends
so seamlessly into my skin and again it
doesn't highlight any dry areas but it
also doesn't look oily somehow it's this
like magic potion that combats oil but
it also combats dryness in my skin
just looks like satin it doesn't look
super matte it doesn't look super oily
like I said it's just perfect and no
matter what primer I put on under it
this still looks amazing I always apply
it with a brush
honestly I typically apply my foundation
with a brush over a Beauty Blender I
feel like I go through trends with that
and right now I'm on a rush kick but I
love this stuff so much if you've if
you've been looking and trying a lot of
different products it's worth giving
this one a try a few of similar skin to
mine by the way this top is from Target
it's just like a really simple
long-sleeve black top they have like a
striped one as well if I can find this
on their website I'll link it below it
is so cheap and it's exactly what I was
wanting where it's not too revealing
like it doesn't go too low but it still
has that cute you know kind of trendy
look to it so I'll link it below
continuing on with face I have some
disappointing products with the face
speaking of sponges this is one I was
disappointed with this is there I saw
the Box beautifully precise precision
sponge trio and it comes with like a
small medium and large and it just
didn't do anything like I feel like any
sponge that is trying to be like a
Beauty Blender sponge there's something
about it that never quite matches up
right the closest I found is the Real
Techniques one that's like orange that
one is really really good as well but
everything else and I had such high
hopes because elf always surprises me
but it's almost as if the core is still
dense no matter how much water you get
into this sucker the rest of it will
expand the way a Beauty Blender does but
the core doesn't and because of that I
feel like it just I don't know like it's
the weirdest thing but when I was using
it I've used it with a couple
foundations a couple concealers no
matter what I did it looked crazy like
to the point where I had to reapply and
finally I said I'm giving up I can't do
it anymore
so one of those things I would say a way
if you're trying to find one on a budget
try the Real Techniques one it is really
really good elf face I love their
contour and illuminating palette these
are a freaking bargain for the price and
on top of that they're incredible
quality every time I use these I am
astonished by how long it stays on how
great it applies and how great it looks
I mean that's like the trifecta right
but I love the like darker contour shade
here
I actually used it today and I used it
kind of warrant like as a bronzer I put
it there but I also kind of bronzed up
he probably can't fell because of these
lights but I kind of bronze up my
forehead as well they have this matte
yellow powder that looks amazing it's
setting under-eye concealer they have
this white kind of highlight II ish
color I don't really use that one as
often and then they have a more warm
toned bronzer that would also look
amazing I just always end up going for
this one I don't know why I'm looks like
I'm getting close to hitting pan on the
contour and on the banana colored powder
so I love love love this you can pop
these out and mix and match them and
make your own so I always talk about
like if I did I would take this one and
this one out and I would put it with in
there illuminating palette some of these
I can't even decide which ones so
there's like a deeper like kind of
orange one there's there's like a light
yellowish white a pearly champagne a
beige kind of shimmer and then more of
an orange tone amazing looks amazing on
different skin types to Pitt depending
on your tone and I really like the beige
one just for my skin tone it's not like
BAM in your face so you probably can't
even see that but it's just this subtle
glow it reminds me of the hourglass
ambient lighting powders that I love and
I own like so many different versions of
because it makes your skin just look
like it's glowing from within literally
and it doesn't look like you're wearing
a glittery highlight or anything it's
just so subtle and I feel like all of
these are subtle in that way and that's
why I love this if you haven't tried it
oh my gosh probably top 5 favorites I'm
wearing a lot of this on my face today
so as I'm going through I'll tell you
like I said I'm wearing the contour
palette today so I have some of their
blush duos um I've had all of them
through the years numerous times but I
always end up decluttering some just
because maybe the the shade isn't right
for my paler skin tone etc this one is
so cool I know it's one of their newer
products it's their bronzed pink beige
and it's this like water based cream
product and I'm not big on cream things
like this but this one impressed me to
know and it's incredibly pigmented but
it's almost like a cream to powder so it
doesn't end up like the Knicks the NYX
cream blushes end up looking a little
bit dewy and wet on your skin
I don't mind but these don't do that
these really are like a cream to powder
they're the coolest texture i remember
when i swatched it in their store I was
like what is this texture it was so
crazy I had to have it
so I really really liked it it's almost
as if it's a cross between a cream blush
and I want to say it's similar to like
the color pop products you know where
it's got that like unbelievable feel it
reminds me of a cross between that
really really good now this pink is a
little bit too pink for me the bronzer I
really like though that's the one I
reach for more the pink I mean obviously
you can share it out use it with the
simple brush it's fine but I just end up
going for a lighter blush just generally
the other one I have still is the
regular powder duo in Saint Lucia and
it's a lot let me compare it's a lot
more tame than the cream one if you
notice especially that blush color the
bronzers not too too different but the
blush color is actually what I'm wearing
on my cheeks today it's got glitter in
it but the glitter is so pretty that I
don't mind it's kind of a golden glitter
and it just looks really nice on the
skin the bronzer is really nice too
again it does have some shimmer to it
but it still looks nice it just kind of
looks healthy but if you don't like
shimmer you wouldn't like this duo like
I said they have a couple other duos all
of them are good they're all really
pigmented they all stay on for a long
time you'd be very impressed so if you
found a shade or duo that you like then
it's definitely worth picking worth
picking up all right so this is the elf
loose powder and sheer I've got to be
honest I just don't ever reach for this
I've had a couple of these in fact this
one's not even open I continue to
declutter it only because I feel like
when I use it I don't think it's a bad
powder at all I don't want you to get
that impression because it's not I just
feel like there are so many really good
loose powders out there right around
this same price range that you really
can't go wrong because for with this
kind of a powder you know you're not
going for a super-dee-duper natural look
when you're using a loose powder like
this not that it goes on white like this
but just that you can always tell and so
I always like to use like a setting
spray on top of something like this just
to really be sure that it's kind of
melded into my skin so I know that elf
and I don't have a
in my collection anymore they also have
a smaller one of these like an under-eye
loose setting powder that's pretty good
too I know that one of them has glitter
in it and I didn't personally like that
but I know a lot of people love that
because it's brightening so if you are
into that it's definitely worth checking
out as well so like I said these aren't
bad I just don't use it because I have
like literally right now like seven
loose powders but it is a good one one
product I think is so cool is this elf
HD mattifying balm it's similar to the
YSL I actually mentioned this in a dupes
video I did a bunch of really expensive
products and then really chew cheap
cheap oh my gosh cheap drugstore dupes
for them and I will link that below
because I was very proud of the dupes I
found because some of them like no one
had ever heard of but this was one of
them in there and it's a dupe for the
YSL product that's similar and it's kind
of this waxy this one's really creamy
though but it's like a waxy type balm
and the idea is that you get a little
bit whether it's on a brush sponge your
finger whatever and if your oily
anywhere you could just tap it in that
area and it soaks up the oil without
adding any powder and it actually does
work it's so cool if you're into not
looking powdery but maybe from time to
time you look and you're like gosh I
want to get rid of that but um and maybe
you're not into those like the little
papers that you can soak up the oil the
oil blotting papers then you would like
this I think it's really cool it does a
great job as well even not just removing
oil but melting things together so like
I'll use this similar to their daily
moisture stick to like meld my under-eye
together from time to time I just really
like it it's a cool unique product that
they have so I love their studio blushes
I actually only own one shade right now
mellow mauve and I love this I use it
all the time I've got like a serious dip
in it now but it you almost won't even
see the swatch if you've got a skin tone
similar mind you will love this it's a
very dusty simple peach but it's so
beautiful and it's one of those things I
could get a ton on my brush and throw it
on and it always looks perfect because
you can't really be too heavy-handed
with it which I actually like I know a
lot of people like super pigmented
blushes I actually would prefer if they
were like a little less so then I could
just go crazy and I won't look like a
clown that's more because I'm lazy and I
don't want to like
the time to make sure it's perfectly
placed I just want to expand on and go
but I love their blushes any of them so
find a shade you know would look good on
you and you will love it but I really
like mellow mauve for my skin tone
alright so I've got another I've got two
highlighting products of theirs that are
kind of duds and I say kind of because
one of these is their elf that's elf
they're like highlight baked
highlighting powder and blush gems
people rave about this on YouTube and so
I was excited to get my hands on it and
I feel like I got a dud like because
it's baked it's hard to get much on and
so even when I'm putting it on with my
brush like I'm like what like it never
looks like I'm wearing much and for
something like this people say it's
similar to Mac soft and gentle Mac let
me go grab it it's totally totally
different so people say it's similar to
Mac soft and gentle let me show you Mac
soft and gentle oh my gosh it Mac soft
and gentle is amazing it's just like
crazy shimmery beautiful highlight but
it's one of those things it's not a
natural highlight so if you're going for
that you're not going to get it with
this so people compare it and I swear
I'll see their swatches no Michael yo
they are so similar they're a similar
shade but this I cannot get to like
apply much at all and I have a baked
bronzer of theirs in Los Cabos that I
was so excited about but it's the same
thing like I can't get like anything
like there's a little bit so it's not I
guess I shouldn't say I can't get
anything but it's not caught quite what
I envisioned when everyone was raving
about these so I don't know if I got dud
batches where you know maybe they're
good batches in bad but it was really
frustrating hour so sad because so many
people rave about them I don't know like
if I saw these in the store I would pass
on them just because they're beautiful
looking but if there's a chance you
could get a bad batch or whatever then
it's not really worth the gamble
I don't think another one that is kind
of unique for elf not unique but it's
their little like little balls I don't
know what else to call them the names
not on it but it's like they're
highlighting ones and again this is it
comes with a little poof I think less I
don't think it's necessarily to use it
with it although no I kind of want to
if I can it's less to use with I think
it's more just to keep them in there
when you put the lid back on but I think
it's so cool to have a drugstore option
of this because the other option is like
the Guerlain ones that are like crazy
expensive but I've had those in the past
too and I ended up getting rid of those
as well because I just felt like it
really I liked subtle things but it was
too subtle and this one is very similar
very very subtle so I feel like I rarely
reach for these I don't think they're
bad I think they're doing exactly what
they're supposed to do but it's
definitely for a subtle glow so I do
still like it though but I usually use
it on like really simple low-key days
let's talk about eyes because I'm
wearing some of this stuff on my eyes
today um I'm wearing their smudge pot in
wine not and it's this really pretty I
think kind of unique color it's like a
purplish reddish grayish it's like the
coolest mix of colors these are really
great I've done a whole video on their
smudge pots and swatches and stuff I can
also link below I really like these
these this is the only one I currently
have because it was my old ones were
starting to dry out I really do like
this shade a lot and the way I applied
it is I just put it on with my fingertip
and then I just took a fluffy brush and
blended it kind of into the crease and
of course I've got some other shadows
actually from the Too Faced sweet peach
palette that I worked into my crease but
I love this stuff it does not budge it
stays on all day so if you're looking
for a really cheap cream shadow that
actually works these are amazing and
they have a lot of different beautiful
shades they have one called brownie
points-- there's like a brownish one
it's really pretty as well so I have two
of their palettes that I've kept over
the years this one's in nude rose gold
and I love this one it's so pretty now
with these shadows you're not getting
like it's not like the most amazing
palette in the entire world
however are they good yes do you have to
maybe make sure you blend them really
well yes so I wouldn't say like I'm not
going to compare these to an urban decay
palette and say yes they're just as good
and you can say no they're not but
they're still really good for the price
and you don't have to spend up much
money to get a great end look it's just
that the pro
of putting them on might be a little
different you might have to work a
little harder but the end result can be
just as beautiful as some of the Urban
Decay palettes so this one's been mad
format this is an amazing matte palette
I would say out of the two if you don't
have any of them go for the matte one
because I think it's a little bit better
quality and it's one of those things
that again it's so rare to find
something like this in the drugstore and
this has such a nice range of warm and
cool tones deeper lighter colors the
nude rose gold is beautiful but I feel
like the shades are kind of hit or miss
but you can get some nice looks but a
lot of it just kind of blends together
which I don't mind but I know a lot of
people do I don't mind more of course
today I'm wearing orbits like darker
look but on a normal day I do wear more
just light very simple looks so
something to keep in mind but they are
good and I product of theirs that I'm
kind of meant about are these cream like
shadows now when I first tried them I
really liked them but upon further
investigation of wearing them you know
four months after that I kind of
realized that they're not bad but I feel
like they're not great now this one I
think is better than the other this
one's called molten bronzed and it's
this gorgeous bronze color but I feel
like when you start to kind of blend it
it starts to just blend away and that I
don't like this one again is better than
this next one this next one is called
rose gold and this is the one I was the
most excited about um and it looks
beautiful when you first put it on your
hand I mean these are gorgeous it's not
that they're not beautiful but again as
you kind of blend them they start to
blend away and you can start to see the
skin underneath I don't think these are
bad don't get me wrong but I feel like
the Maybelline Color tattoo ones are
really good now in this one's favor
I think the Maybelline Color tattoo ones
like these are gloopy right upon first
use and I don't like that either because
then it just kind of looks like you
could get a gloop somewhere and then
it's way too much and so I like that
these are almost a thinner formula so
it's easier to see where you're applying
it you don't accidentally get too much
but again like I said if you're trying
to blend it with other things I think
it's not quite right for that the way I
like to wear these is alone they look
amazing alone especially the molten
one if I just put it on my lid and kind
of blend it into the crease and leave it
it looks amazing so I don't think
they're terrible they're just not my
favorite I love their long-lasting
lustrous eyeshadows so I have a silver a
gold and like this maroon one and the
maroon one is my favorite it's called
soiree and these are kind of like the
I've used so much of this it's like
almost gone I there's a mirror right
here I literally just showed it to the
mirror like anyone was in the mirror
looking anyway but these are so good
they're like this kind of creamy formula
um almost whipped if you will but it's
like a cream eyeshadow they're very
similar but I think these are just more
fun to work with because they are like
that whipped formula but this one is so
beautiful you can just wear it on your
lids and go and it looks so gorgeous the
gold one is really nice as well this
one's called toasts it reminds me of New
Year's in fact I might wear this on New
Year's and then the silver one which I
don't reach for as much just because I
don't love the way silver looks on me is
called celebration and it's just this
gorgeous super shimmery silver this is a
great way to get glitter on your eyelids
without getting glitter all over your
face because it's kind of embedded in
this whipped formula the glitter doesn't
fall everywhere like it would with a
loose glitter or with a glitter
eyeshadow and that's why I think these
are amazing extra little mention the elf
makeup removing cleansing cloths these
are great these are inexpensive they
remind me of the Mac ones their
packaging is very very similar to Mac um
these really are good and they remove
makeup I don't use these to remove
makeup I don't use any makeup removing
wipes to remove makeup at the end of the
day but I do like these you know if you
swatch on your hand like I do it removes
those to remove lip color just you know
in the middle of the day if you're
taking it off these are great I have a
pack in my classroom as well I think
they're great
let's talk about lips let's talk about
what I'm wearing on my lips today and
I'm drinking coffee so I feel like it's
kind of getting everywhere this is I
love this formula their new velvet
mattes is that what it's called um but
this one's in deep burgundy and I love
it because these are really velvety and
matte but still comfortable and I just
think this color is so gorgeous it
really is like that deep kind of a
burgundy without being like just black
or
us you know it's got some actual red
tint to it or like pink tint to it I
should say I just think it's so pretty
I'm wearing it on my lips today now I'm
wearing it with an a lip liner that is
kind of more purple like pinkish purple
so I feel like that mixture does make it
look a little different on my lips and
actually I need to reapply a little more
and I don't think that these are like
insanely long-lasting um I wouldn't say
they like wipe right off in like 30
minutes but I do feel like when I wear
these I have to reapply them you know
every so often especially with a deep
color where I don't want it to be super
obvious or anything like that I'm really
picky about it I'm sure most of us are I
have another one called vampy violet and
this one if you like really really deep
shades this is like a deep deep purple
right they also have one called blackout
that's literally black so if you're into
that or you need for a costume whatever
they have that as well I want to get
some of the lighter shades I haven't
tried any but this formula is a newer
formula for them and it's my favorite of
theirs so that's the lipstick I would
recommend they also have these touch of
little lip ones and this one's called
touch of pink and it's just a really
pretty I am running out of room to
swatch let me use one of my ones in
cloths so I just wiped off the swatches
with the thing and I would say it did a
pretty good job um so they have these
called touch of pink and touch of berry
I think they've got a couple others
these are the two I've kept touch of
pink is just a really simple everyday
pink touch of berry you can guess it
just a touch of berry these are a little
I wouldn't call them sheer because
they're not but they aren't like crazy
deep pigmented like the velvet ones are
and I like these again for everyday if
you just want like a simple everyday
color just slap on your lips not worry
about lip liner or anything like that
these are beautiful so I really like
these these I want to put one of the
touch of pink one in my purse so I'll
use it alright so some lip glosses i
really like this was just another unique
product from elf that I think you should
own this one's their pout Perfector and
glow and it's this like glittery it's
got a brush tip which is not my favorite
but this is one of those things you
could just put on the center of your
bottom lip just to make it really glow
it's this glittery pink look to it and I
think that's a great way to get that
kind of glossy trendy look right now
without just straight-up going full
metallic glam because that's not for me
I just don't love it on myself but this
is kind of a nice in-between and I love
it and this smells so good it smells
like like lip smacker
to me I really like it and I really this
is their high shine liquid lipstick and
it's in the shade bitten pink and again
it's got this it's got this really cool
doe foot that's got like a scoop in it
so it like collects product into it so
it applies even better to your lips and
I think this color is really cool it's a
really pigmented formula it's going to
call it thick it is a little bit thicker
than what you'd be used to like just in
a lip gloss which is why they call it a
liquid lipstick but it is high shine so
it doesn't like dry down or anything I
just think it's really pretty and a good
formula it's comfortable to wear but it
really packs that punch one product that
is in my purse all the time is this elf
lip balm and it's in nude and it's kind
of like a brown peach kind of a nude you
can see it right there it's just so easy
to just put on my lips it's got some SPF
in it which i think is great and it
makes my lips look more put together
without like having to do anything with
it other than just throw this on this
product I can't live without now what's
funny is in my maybe my very first elf s
amorous back when I was live with my
parents before I got married a couple
years ago um this was one that I didn't
like and I don't know if they redid the
formula or maybe I like learned how to
use it better that's probably what it is
but it's their elf lip exfoliator and it
looks like a lipstick but it has these
like little granules in it that are like
exfoliating but I've kind of learned
that you know for this to work you need
to have it has like a waxy balm on the
outside but as you wear it down it just
gets kind of weird so you have to have
like some kind of lip balm on first
before you start exfoliating and then it
really does wonders this has been a
saving grace probably once a week every
week so I love it this is their like
cherry one they have a mint one what
else I know they have at least one other
one but I really like the cherry the
mint is good too one last mention I
mentioned every time if you don't know
about it it's their makeup remover pen
it's just a little like almost q-tip
q-tip shaped thing that has makeup
remover in it and then you know they're
a couple bucks you can replace it every
few months I use it every day to like
clean up a winged liner or anything like
that it's amazing I had to mention it
there are so many elf products out there
I mean
I feel like I could continue to talk
about health products forever but I hope
this kind of gave you a feel for if
you're new to elf or maybe if you're
just looking for some new stuff maybe
you have a gift card whatever I hope
this helped you kind of get your feet
wet with what they have that's great
what they have that maybe you should
avoid just to get an idea of the
different products they offer I'm also
going to do an elf skincare video I
think I'm gonna film it today actually
about their skincare because they have
really inexpensive fantastic stuff and I
can't wait to tell you guys about it and
how I use it um I haven't had breakouts
on my in my on my skin other than maybe
like hormonal ones every few months
probably in eight months
I don't know and I've been using the elf
skincare for the past few months I love
it so I will get to that if it's already
up I will link it below other than that
I hope that this video was helpful I
hope that you'll subscribe
I also hope you'll catch me on my social
media which is right there on the screen
