gonna share with you the best and worst
of flower beauty I am so excited this is
a brand that they sell at Walmart some
of this stuff I bought with my own money
some of it was sent to me from them but
you guys know I'm always honest with you
guys whether something was sent to me or
not I feel like a broken record other
than that I hope that you will subscribe
before you leave to catch more of the
style of videos and let's go and get
into it alright so I've got some
eyeshadow palettes and base products
some cheek products that lip products
brushes sponges let's start with their
brushes nobody talks about their brushes
their brushes are incredible they really
are these are just two of them honestly
some of them well this one's actually
dirty I use this for bronzer it's like
kind of a smaller bronzer brush but I
used it today to apply it I don't know
the name of these brushes but they have
black handle ones and white handled ones
and they all can like sit upright if you
want them to but they're just pretty and
not only are they pretty because
obviously we don't have brushes just to
look at we want to use them they're so
soft and so good at applying things so
like this is a powder brush I've
actually cleaned it but it's the perfect
size to just powder your whole face I
love their brushes I really do I have
some of their eye brush and I couldn't
find them oh yes this is one okay so
here's a flower I brush it's kind of
like a kind of a thicker shader brush
and I'll use it to pack on shadow on the
lid but again there's that same kind of
they have a flat bottom but they're
really they have the beautiful rose gold
ferrule and they're just good brushes so
I highly recommend I've tried a ton of
their brushes and all of them that I've
tried have been really really good so I
highly recommend these and on that same
vein
this is dirty I'm so sorry this is what
it is the purple flower beauty like
sponge for foundation is the best sponge
I have ever tried ever ever
I loved the Beauty Blender and I still
do I like the Real Techniques ones real
technique ones a lot as well the orange
ones still do and I really like the pink
L'Oreal ones I tried that and I was so
pleasantly surprised but this one's the
best one and the reason why it's the
best is because when you get it wet it
expands so much and it's the softest
thing applying your finish it
just the best i love it i need more this
is the only one i have i need to go buy
another one because obviously i need to
clean it but it's so good and I'm like
so thankful that I tried this one I did
because it's just the best one ever
next let's talk about this amazing trio
that I I have been so tired of like
trios like this that I was like I kind
of put this on the back burner I'm like
I'll try it later well it's really good
every single shade in here
it's their lift and sculpt contouring
palette and it's in medium to deep
obviously I don't have medium to deep
skin tone but this works really really
well the bronzer the blush the highlight
they're so ridiculously creamy it does
kick up some powder but they're like
these softest things you've ever put
your fingers on and there they do kick
up powder so I just blew off the dust
but they definitely kick up powder so I
would say when you apply it with your
brush I always tap my brush off first to
get that excess off and then apply it
these are the softest most beautiful
shades they blend so seamlessly and all
especially when worn together I mean
this gold highlights pretty gold for me
I've gotten away with wearing it just
because I just love it and just use the
light hand but like the blush and the
bronzer they're so soft looking on your
face they don't tend to look patchy
because they're so soft and they
actually are easy to blend so while I
was really tired of like these kinds of
trios and I have so many this one really
stood out and I'm so shocked at how much
I ended up liking this so I had to
mention that one earlier on because it
is surprisingly good on that same note
they have this highlighting palette
called shimmer and strobe and it's a
similar packaging but this one they have
a little brush on it and it's actually
pretty soft I've never used it though to
be honest but they have like that I
think I might be that same gold and then
they have like a light pink and like a
kind of more beige toned and it's the
same kind of a formula incredibly soft
lots of powder kick up these are
ridiculously shimmery though that's
something you like you would love this
it is pretty cool that it has the three
different tones too so if you're maybe I
mean you can really experiment you could
mix you
roll your brush in all three if you want
in fact let me just try that yeah if you
do all three it kind of becomes this
more like beige tone kind of a mixture
of all three so they're incredibly
shimmery but not glittery at all so at
least you know even though yes they kick
back some powder there's not gonna be
glitter fallout which I really
appreciate but they're just beautiful
beautiful highlights they totally catch
the light beautifully and with that one
you'd at least have some options let's
talk about one that's kind of a dud it's
not terrible but it's not my favorite
it's this flower beauty powder I just
feel like it's just a standard powder
very reminiscent of like the Cody
airspun now you'd be buying it for the
packaging because the packaging is
beautiful as they all are they always
have this pretty like rose gold on them
and it's so very kind of old-fashioned
in a beautiful way and it's got the
little puff that's his flower and then
there's the white translucent powder it
can get messy like most powders can but
I just think the powder is just okay I
feel like it's the same as just putting
like freaking cornstarch on my face you
know what I mean it soaks up the oil it
definitely makes my face I've got normal
to dry skin it definitely makes my face
feel drier it doesn't you know there are
other powders out there like the Laura
Mercier one that when I put that on I
don't feel like it emphasizes any
dryness whereas this one I really feel
like it does it gets caught in those
areas so for me this is a pass I just
it's not that it's horrible and if
you're looking for a white translucent
powder to soak up oil this will do that
for you it's not horrible but for my
skin type it's just not for me the eye
shadow palettes that I have these are
interesting so it's the shimmer and
shade eyeshadow palette and then oh and
warm natural and then this one is an
intense natural so the intense one has
they both have deep colors but like the
the warm Natura is a lot more pinky and
purpley tones which is interesting that
they call it warm natural I don't this
is not necessarily the palette I would
think of for that but this one has some
matte shades and some shimmers and then
the intense natural has only one matte
shade and a lot of shimmers so for me my
favorite of the two
is definitely the warm naturals it just
has a little bit more of like useful
shades to me these three are all matte
or at least like satin it's like their
version of matte every single shade in
both of these every single one is
incredibly pigmented but again it's that
same formula as the face products very
very I don't want to say powdery because
it kicks up powder but it's not like a
chalky finish it's a very smooth silky
finish in all of their products so you
have to grapple with do you want a
palette that you kind of got to work
with a little bit but if you found a
palette that like the shades were
totally up your alley it'd be worth it I
think in the drugstore this is
definitely one of the better palettes I
was very impressed with again how silky
and shimmery they are but again you Det
you have to remember to either blow on
your brush or tap it off whichever you
prefer because you will definitely have
powder fallout as you're applying these
so either use these and apply them
before you do your face makeup or if
you're like me I always do my face
makeup first you have to be very very
careful I have to be very careful with
these so for that reason I feel like
these are great palettes but I don't
reach for them as much because I know
that there's work that has to go into
them blending wise I think they blend
pretty well I don't think the blend
ability is as amazing as like high-end
palettes but again you're paying less
for these so you have to decide which
which makes more sense for you so
overall I would say these are pretty
darn good palettes for the drugstore
there's also this one shade in the warm
natural at the very end and it's like
this kind of like lavender kind of not
holographic but like iridescent shade
and I think it's so unique and really
cool so if you were interested in that
kind of a shade I really like this
palette but that shade is really really
cool and I don't think I have anything
quite like it so I have five flower pots
blushes I have three they're matte and
three that are shimmery so the names of
the shades here are the first one is
called wild rose and it's kind of a
brighter pink the next one's my favorite
called sweet pea just because it's a
neutral pink then the peach one is
called peach Primrose and then the next
one is a shimmery one called
warm hibiscus
and the last one's kind of spicy and
it's called deep peony so I like these
because other than like deep peony
they're pigmented enough to show up
really nicely but they're not so
pigmented that you have to be like
nervous that you're gonna put way too
much on and look like a clown and I feel
like that's kind of hard to find you
either get a blush that really does not
have much pigmentation you got to really
build it up a lot or you get one that's
so pigmented that you're like oh my gosh
it's like an eye shadow like it's too
too pigmented and I feel like they've
really kind of bridge the gap well for
my skintone like I mentioned I like the
sweet pea and the peach one the shimmer
you want I mean they're all really
pretty the packaging is a lot thinner
than like the Milani
flower ones and the flower on it is a
lot flatter than those and they're just
these are just generally smaller but I
kind of appreciate the compactness of
the design so I really like these they
last really well I feel like you can
find good drugstore blushes from a lot
of brands at the drugstore and I think
this is just another one that they
really are good but my favorite that I
would recommend is Sweet Pea okay next
is this flower in your prime ultimate
eye primer this is a great eye primer
it's got kind of more of a white lotion
type feel to it I thought it would be
similar like the Milani eye primer but
it's actually a very different formula
it's almost like lotion like it feels
moisturizing but it kind of dries down
to this kind of perfected very soft
finish and the shadow is cling to it
really really well now I don't have oily
eyelids so if you're one that really
suffers from creasing all the time I
don't know how this will perform so if
you're like that you've tried it please
let us know down in the comments but I
really really like it it's so unique in
its way and it's got like a not like a
metal lid but it kind of feels like
heavier it's they do a great job of
making their products feel a little bit
more high quality than you know the
price point is which i think is really
cool next is their primer this is their
perfecting primer it's just it kind of
feels like a lotion a lot of primers
like this will feel lotion E and then
kind of like that
I primer it'll kind of like end up
blending into feeling like that kind of
silicone feel but this really does not
have that kind of a feel but it
definitely has kind of a evened out feel
I don't know how to describe it it's
kinda ghin it's a very unique formula
I've never tried a primer like this but
it works for dry skin and normal skin
and I would have to think it might work
for oily skin because it really does
kind of just set once you blend it in it
has a slight smell that's kind of sweet
perfume me but not I don't know it
definitely is there like you can smell
it so if you're sensitive to smell you
might not want to try this but again a
very unique primer I I don't really know
how to describe it because I've never
tried anything like it but it does a
good job of holding on the foundation
pretty well I don't think it's the best
primer at that so it's kind of one of
those things that I don't think you need
to run out and get it the last product
is from is from flower beauty Jessica
that's what we're talking about it's
their color proof long wear lip cream I
like the color
the formula is okay I just don't think
it's separated I don't like the
applicator it's one of those like hard
sponges that you squeeze through and
it's kind of separated and I don't think
it's been that long since I've worn it
so that's always gross anyway the color
is really pretty it's in the shade I'm
blushing and it's kind of like a whipped
kind of a feel to it
but it says long wear lip cream and this
is not something that dries down which I
don't mind I don't love matte lip colors
so I like the finish of this but long
wear I don't really agree with I feel
like after like an hour and a half I
need to touch it up just because it's
it's kind of a wet formula you naturally
kind of it naturally just wears off but
I do think it's a really pretty lip
color so as long as you're okay with
reapplying it and you find a shade you
like you will really like it's really
comfortable I just wish I would I wish I
had a doe foot applicator and I
appreciate that there's no flowery scent
because sometimes their lip products
have floral scents hence the name flower
beauty but and it's like bad floral like
way too strong and it just would give me
like I would just feel nauseous so this
is definitely
I tried quite a few there lip products
and this is
definitely my favorite of their so the
other ones I've gotten rid of so those
are all of my favorites and kind of
flops there weren't really too many flop
flops from the brand flower beauty if
you're interested I will link whatever I
can find down below I hope that you'll

of videos I've done a I've done an elf
