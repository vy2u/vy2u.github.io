gonna share with you my August favorites
and flops I have some high end flops in
fact I have three high end products that
I really am NOT loving right now so I'm
excited to share those with you guys and
I like to sprinkle those throughout so
stay tuned for those but I also have a
lot of favorites so I hope that you
enjoy this style of video if you do
definitely give it a thumbs up and I
hope that you will subscribe to catch
more of my videos let's go ahead and get
into it that just sounded like a robot
alright so I've got a mix of drugstore
and high-end as I almost always do and
I'm excited to share them with you so
have I already said that I am excited I
haven't had enough coffee today hold on
has anyone ever been to the Biltmore in
which Carolina is it in we were just
there North Carolina right so right
someone that is from North or South
Carolina is screaming at the screen
right like no it's this one anyway um it
was so much fun scene the Biltmore we
did that like we drove down there I
don't know maybe last was it last
November the November before I want to
say it was last November either way it
was so much fun
we stayed like in the mountains and an
air B&amp;amp;B it was so cool anyway so I have
a lot of tutorials if I'm wearing this
today I film myself putting it on so
I'll definitely show that as I'm talking
about it so you can see what it looks
like as its applied so I tried to wear
as much as I could let's start with
something that is completely new to me
including the brand this is the brand
volition and this is their oil control
mattifying mist
now this brand I know is sold at Sephora
and I think they like just started being
sold at Sephora and as many of you guys
know there are just a lot of brands this
is like the season of Sephora trying on
new brands in their store and online
well volition sent me a bunch of stuff
which you guys know I'm set a lot of
stuff and I'm always honest when I talk
about it whether I like it or not they
send me other things I haven't tried yet
this is the only one I tried and oh my
gosh it's really really nice now I don't
really care about mattifying miss
because my hair my skin I told you
hasn't had enough coffee not my hair my
skin is typically dry it's kind of
normal right now but it's never really
truly Willy
so I'm trying to talk quieter save your
voice Jess
they're right there anyway but I tried
this and I was like you know I wonder
it's kind of still summertime you know I
do get a little oily here so I sprayed
it on and it just like gets rid of the
oil but it doesn't look powdery I don't
know how it does it
I really don't know how it does it but
it's I like the packaging but with
setting sprays the most important part
is the mist as well I guess it can't be
the most cuz also the formula should be
probably number one but the formula
could be amazing but if the mister is
not good you might get like little
splotches and then like I feel like
there's an elf one I've tried that the
sprayer nozzle is just not very good and
so even if the formula is great it
doesn't matter when it's just like weird
and splotchy it doesn't do what it's
supposed to do so this one has a really
fine mist it does have a fragrance what
does it remind me of kind of rosy maybe
like a rosy kind of a fragrance so if
that bothers you you might not like it
or if your skin is bothered by fragrance
I would stay away but if it is not I
think you'd be really impressed it is
kind of small like this one's a 1.7 and
I'm curious yeah like I have this cover
FX mattifying one which is also really
good but this one has four ounces so
this is a lot smaller that's something
to keep in mind and I feel like these
are really similar but I just I've used
both lately and I've every time I spray
this one on and I look at my face at the
end of the day I feel like my face
always looks better than it does when I
use this one but they're both really
good the next favorite is much much
cheaper than that one this shirt showed
me crazy and also please don't make fun
of the fact that I got like broccoli
soup on my shirt and I can't get it off
and I am 5 years old I'm a 5 year old
there's that kid in elementary school
that would always and also all my life
but like I would always need a change of
like a shirt because I would always get
my lunch all over yourself so the next
one that I freaking love I'm wearing on
my lips today it's this NYX lingerie I
have to admit NYX makes so many lip
products that when I hear about them I'm
like because they make so many I'm like
how could any of them possibly
be any different than the stuff that
they already have out then stuff that's
already out there you know what I'm
saying they have so many lip lines like
maybe too many but whatever they're
cheap I love that you can find any shade
you could ever want which is amazing
well this stuff I was like why are
people talking about this like how good
could it be is it a liquid lipstick is
it lip gloss like what is it until
you've tried this on your lips not just
watching it on your hand cuz I had done
that before like in the store like an
Ulta where they have testers and I was
like but I finally decided to buy some
and then of course like after I bought
some NYX sent me a bunch and I'm like
awesome but of course of course it's
like a week after I buy it anyway
regardless this is the shade push-up and
like I said it's what I'm wearing on my
lips today it might look darker on me
than on others because my lips are
naturally pigmented but it's a really
pretty color so you put it on your lips
and the reason it's called lingerie has
to be that it's like this it doesn't
look sheer but when you kind of smooth
it out on your lips it like sheers and
becomes like one with your lips but it's
not dry it feels like a lip balm but not
even it's like between a lip balm and
something drying it's not drying and
like the best way to explain is that it
does it becomes one with your lips and
so I'm like oh my gosh like I like I'm
looking in the mirror I'm like I feel
like my lips look so nice
and healthy but I just went no no no no
and it's done so anyway this stuff is
amazing fine too shady with love it's
inexpensive and oh my gosh I can't
believe it was right under my nose all
along and it took me this long to
finally try it okay let's talk about a
flop I've tried to make this one work
I'm more mad that I just spent the money
on it and I don't have the receipt me
more I think it's been too long since I
bought it I don't know I need to look
into it regardless this is the buxom
show some skin foundation and it's
they're weightless foundation light to
medium coverage SPF 30 I liked that it
was clear packaging I don't know why
that I kind of liked the way it was
packaged just something different and so
you squeeze it out and I can't figure
out how to use this it's very
thin it's not really like runny runny
though it's just more thin and of course
I've got a self-tanner on today this is
fake I just think it's like I don't self
tan very often so what I do I'm like
Jesse you look like crazy like it's like
weird to me to see and then there's
other people that tan all the time like
self tan and that's like what they're
used to but for me I'm like why is
everyone anyway um why did I even talk
about that so this stuff it's super
super thin and I can't get it to work
with my skin I don't mind something that
doesn't have high coverage if it makes
my skin look healthier but this doesn't
have very good coverage which is fine
but it just makes my skin look crummy
whereas I could just grab a tinted
moisturizer that probably has better
ingredients for my skin and put that on
my skin looks better than it does with
this and this was expensive so their
claim is blend a pearl sized amount of
this weightless foundation on your face
for a moisturize smooth glowing even
looking complexion apply more to build
coverage now Rach what you've got I
don't know you guys tell me do you have
you found a great way to apply it I
swear to you I've tried everything and I
just can't make it work so let me know
if you know a trick or just something
about this because I'm if I'm gonna have
it I want to use it it was a lot of fun
all right
let's talk about some more favorites
these are the Revlon Photoready
insta-fix highlighting sticks guys this
shade right here gold light is a dream
it is like the most and I'm like I said
typically fair skinned today I look a
little tanner but it is like this
beautiful light light light gold
highlighter and what I've been doing is
it's creamy but not so creamy and it
just gets everywhere
it's just creamy enough that like I'll
literally just go kind of like here oh
no oh so that sucks and it's on my shirt
some of you guys are gonna be very happy
because I film a lot of videos in one
day because it's just the way I have to
do it with the full-time job
oh my gosh this sucks anyway this poor
shirt I only want it like this
might be the first time I've ever
actually worn it and I have makeup all
over it
you'll be happy to know that I'm gonna
try to change shirts I feel like I'm
like yet again like lying to you guys
but a lot of you guys like just change
your shirt between filming like 1 or 2
videos and so it's like looks a little
bit different for us when we're watching
it like that's true cuz I do like when
I'm editing I'm like I get bored seeing
myself in the same outfit anyway now I
have to change because I've got crap all
over myself
so this highlighter apparently the
packaging is terrible so now we know
that that stinks but regardless the
formula what I'll do is I'll just go
chand then I'll just take a wet Beauty
Blender or some kind of sponge and just
kind of blend it into that area I'm not
wearing it today because I was trying
out something else I'll show you but it
just looks so healthy and natural so
even if I'm really in a hurry and I'm
not putting on blush or bronzer but I do
want to have that glow this is always
what I've been reaching for the past
month so this is the shade I really like
this other one is in pink light and I
don't know it doesn't look as natural
even when I'm at my fairest because it
is that really really kind of ethereal
whitish pink but like comparing the two
there's the gold one and there's the
pink I really I think the gold one is
pretty even if you have fair skin so I
really really like this you're wondering
this shirt is from Express the necklace
I think from Target probably ok next up
is let's do another product I'm not
liking this is the Marc Jacobs
perfecting coconut eye primer they sent
it to me with a bunch of their eyeshadow
palettes which I was like screaming and
I love their eyeshadow formula for the
most part everyone smile they'll be like
a dud and one of their palettes but
really I just don't understand why we're
still putting like glitter glitter in
eyeshadow why are we still doing that
like I never ever use that shadow in any
brand and any palette because there's
always glitter no matter what primary
use so I just don't I don't get it
anyway that has nothing to do with this
so this primer my problem with it is
that it's insanely expensive and it
just about the same formula as like the
Milani eye primer or anything else but
it also has this horrible thing it does
where like you know I tap it onto my eye
just a very small amount and where I
didn't like like if I forget to like
kind of blend out with maybe a different
finger the outer edges you will see like
a visible line of like where it's mixing
with either your foundation or your
moisturizer you know whatever it is
whatever order you do your makeup in and
it's just gross and then it's really
hard to get like off of there and I'm
like what in the world so I've had to
redo I looks like three different times
with this because it gets really weird
and creepy and I can't like blend it
because it just sets so it does a great
job of holding out a shadow but almost
too good of a job because it'll also
hold on to any other powder anything
that's in that area so I just don't like
it
I don't think it's worth the price at
all so if you're looking for an
alternative I have so there's so many
good eye primers out there you can
almost go wrong with no primer that was
worded weird you can't go wrong with
like any primer unless it does something
like that the Milani eyeshadow primer is
amazing the flower in your prime
ultimate eye primer is amazing these are
amazing cheap ones I could tell you a
million amazing expensive ones but I
figure these would be more worth your
money and you know thinking about this
this one's super expensive and it's
terrible all right another favorite and
I can show you myself applying this one
today this is the balm
mab lash mascara every one of you guys
has told me you've got to try the balm
add lash I'm telling you and you guys
have been telling me this for years and
I just never I you know I get the balm
products all the time I love them but
I've just never tried this and I've had
it unopened for quite a while well I
finally opened it the other day and I
was like I'm just gonna try it and I was
like oh man because it just like it
separates your lashes that adds volume
it curls lashes it stays all day like
this is amazing now I will say this
while I do think this is amazing
I still like my the pink lash paradise
from L'Oreal I still like that one the
best
only because for everyday that one is
like even more like Vell
are you looking where as this does
eventually harden kind of and so if it's
a little wonky like the way you applied
it if it was a little wonky it's gonna
say like that whereas the other one I
mean it just feels like normal lashes so
while I do think this is easily like top
three or four best mascaras I've ever
tried I still like the last paradise one
just a little bit better but this is
amazing I've been using it everyday for
a few weeks now few weeks yeah just
about any way so I really really like it
I highly recommend I would wait I always
buy my products from the balm at 50% off
on HauteLook and I can link that below
because that's where I buy a lot of my
high-end makeup and I don't think I've
ever bought anything from the balm at
full price because almost all of their
products are on there at some point or
another you just have to wait until it's
the until it's on the flash sale another
favorite this one's inexpensive guys
this one is expense yeah I'm telling you
that ahead of time this is the Givenchy
photo perfection perfection with an ex
fluid foundation with sunscreen as SPF
of 20 oh my gosh this foundation is so
beautiful I'm wearing it today I have my
natural color is number five perfect
praline however today since I did self
tan I'm wearing six perfect honey so
what when I'm used to using this shade I
it's just so and both of them are this
way it looks like your skin but perfect
and it doesn't look cakey it doesn't it
stays in place like I love this
foundation it is so beautiful it's a
little bit more liquidy than like the
elf flawless finish that I love and I
still love that one as well like these
are totally on par with that but if
you're feeling splurge Eeyore as I
always say if you have a gift card or
you're just wanting to try a high-end
foundation I really really loved this my
favorite way to apply this is with the
Beauty Blender or I've been using my
L'Oreal pink sponge and I will say this
about this one I loved the Ferb very
first one I ever tried and then I got
another one and I think that one was
actually one they sent to me and it
wasn't the same so I'm kind of tempted
to go
and buy another one and see if that one
is like the other one they sent that was
bad or if it's like this one I don't
know maybe it was a weird batch I hope
they didn't change the formula but the
first one I ever tried this one is
amazing I'll link this below regardless
that's how I've been applying it and it
just is flawless even on my nose I like
the way it looks now at the end of a 12
hour 13 hour day is it perfect I really
feel like for this it really does depend
on the primer I'm using so like if I'm
using my like a really good like pore
filling primer that just like is like
long wearing I think it looks amazing
but if I'm using a more hydrating primer
I don't think those are always as long
wearing and so for this I do notice it
break up around my nose so that's
something to keep in mind but I love it
so my next favorite is from pixie so
it's kind of I treat pixie as like
middle of the road I think it's more
expensive to be considered drugstore
although a lot of the classic drugstore
brands are like going up in price but
this is the pixie and it's Judi time
pallet she's another youtuber that I am
sure you have heard of I've watched her
for years and it's called it's AI time
oh I get it like it's Judi time but oh
my gosh aren't these shades absolutely
gorgeous huge pans gorgeous shades a
great mix of mattes it's got six matte
six shimmer the only one that has
glitter glitter in it looks like is this
black one which I haven't even used
because I just I don't know black with
glitter why are we doing that why isn't
it just black anyway the only thing I
wish this palette had is a light beige
matte because that's for me like I set
my primer with that on my eye and I
usually use it on my brow bone etc and
so I always have to pull and what I've
been using is this wet and wild it's my
favorite the wet and wild single it's
their color icon little single shadow in
brulee and it's just a matte very
pigmented creamy white
oh let's run that black man that is not
coming off anyway it's an amazing shadow
I could talk about it my favorites every
month because it's amazing but these
and so beautifully I'm wearing this
today on my eyes so I'll show you me
applying it while I explain what I'm
wearing I put on this kind of light
peach shade as a kind of crease and
buffing color and then I applied this
darker kind of medium mauve shade again
these are both matte I did that kind of
an outer corner and into my crease a
little bit then I applied this really
pretty deeper reddish bronze color all
over my lid and then on my lower
lashline I use this warm warm brown on
my lower lash line and actually on my
lower lash line I also used
what else did I use on my lower lash
line maybe it was like this shade trying
to remember I used a little bit of that
like all the way in and then the darker
color on the outside so it's so gorgeous
I didn't what I've been using a lot are
these two shimmery colors even just on
their own are so beautiful but today I
didn't use them but I just really loved
it the only shades I haven't gotten a
lot of use out of is like this shade
here it's it's a great shade I just
haven't done a look where I need it the
one thing I will say these do kick up
some powder not like the subculture kind
of kick up but it does take up some
powder so make sure you either blow on
your brush or tap on your brush whatever
your pick your poison their the other
shade I haven't used a lot is this one
again not for any reason I just haven't
done a look with that shade but it's
they're all so beautiful so highly
recommend it pixie sold at Target
ok let's I have one more flop but I want
to tell you about my other favorite this
one I thought about not mentioning
because again it's so expensive but it's
a part of this that I wanted to mention
this is from Kevin aquatics they're
making faces beauty book and the Kevin
of Kwan's like famous book is called
making faces and so these are like all
of his like best-selling best most
well-known products from his entire line
from all the years this has been a brand
and so the one I'm wearing today that
I've been using like crazy is this
contour one so it's got three different
books in it and they magnetized together
if you want them to but this one's
chapter 1 contour
then there's chapter 2 blush into fine
and I'll show you this one really
quickly this one is not part of my
favorites but it is nice it's got these
shadows which really you can use this
like liner and then it's got these
beautiful blushes chador is a really
famous one and then Dalene which is more
peachy and then the other part of it is
the emphasize and it's got eight of his
shadows I guess that are I assume
they're bestsellers which I like I've
played with a little bit but this it has
some of my favorite products of all time
in it and I'm wearing all three of these
today so I'll show you me applying it
but it has the sculpt medium which I did
just on my the back part of my cheekbone
like right where your eyebrow hits it's
about as far as I go with it and then it
has the bronze in desert nights which I
used up kind of just in this region and
sometimes I'll go over that a little bit
but I really today just focus it up
there and then the highlight and
candlelight I just put right here now I
did throw on I think Mac soft and gentle
on top just to make it pop a little horn
this is not a highlight that you can see
from space this is a highlight that
looks unbelievably gorgeous in real life
and that is why I love it because I
don't it's just not my style to have
that kind of a pop and highlight when
I'm teaching or just out and about I
don't mind it but it's just not my
favorite on me anyway so I love these
let me show you some swatches as well
now that you've seen them on they're
just great great powders now they are
powder they kick up some dust but here
they are you can see the very clear
distinction between the contour and the
bronze which I appreciate and I think
that's why I love it so much it really
is sent for two different purposes which
is true for bronzer and contour and I
just love this I could see myself I'm
going to my brother's wedding soon in
San Diego and I could see myself
bringing this for that because that
covers three major can I open it three
major things I would need that I know I
love last thing my last flop is from it
cosmetics this is thereby by pores
illumination I don't understand this
product it's this white powder and it
has this illuminating quality to it but
it's really weirdly pow
and you know which I can get beyond that
but it just leaves this white cast that
I can't get beyond so I could see myself
maybe liking it if I did it on my under
eye like only but I would still worry
that it just looks white under there and
so what I've seen people say about this
or even I think it was the brand like
the thing I read about it was that it's
like it's supposed to blur your pores so
like if you have pores like maybe here
even especially like here it can blur
your pores without making everything
look matte and kind of dead but the
problem is these have this has like
these doesn't have like glitter in it
but it has this quality that just looks
really white so if you were any fairer
than me I don't know how anyone would
wear it so I don't know I guess I just
don't get it again if you've found a way
to make this work for you please let me
know because I want this to work for me
I want every makeup product I own to
work for me so let me know if you found
a good way maybe maybe it would look
better if I use like a wet Beauty
Blender and dipped it in a corner of it
and applied it that way but it just
looks powdery and white and I don't like
it okay I have a really weird favorite
this is from well it's called the shower
cap and this is on Shh
because that is um that's why I love
this okay that's not why so it's a
shower cap and actually this came with
some PR gifts from some brand I think it
was bumble and bumble I think I don't
know regardless this shower cap is
amazing so I've had you know a million
shower caps but they're so big and like
you know weird and crinkly and you never
can get all your hair to actually stay
in there this one is totally formed
finished I'll insert a picture a video
of me wearing this you can actually see
it on but it's kind of got it's like
that turban style it's so beautiful and
it's stretchy so it's fitted it actually
holds all your hair in place it does
it's not as loud when water hits it etc
which again I appreciate it's really
thin and it's machine washable which
I've never really thought about you know
my shower cap it keeps getting wet and
then you know that's kind of gross but
this is machine washable and I don't
know if the one I've been using is
regardless I
really excited about this and I know
that sounds so dumb but like for me I
dry shampoo my hair like every other day
and so I use shower caps a lot and so I
appreciate when this is a very well
thought out one so I will link this
below as well I think it is so so cool
so those are all of my favorites and
flops for the month of August I hope
that you enjoyed and that you will catch
some more of my videos if you'd like to
see my last month's favorites and flops
for July I will link that below as well
otherwise I hope you'll subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next video
