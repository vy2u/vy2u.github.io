that quickly with so I always feel like
I look like free to call it when I've
got my brows and like foundation on and
nothing else how do you think I look um
I'm gonna be trying out the Gigi Hadid
by Maybelline line I bought a lot of the
products I've been trying these out for
a over a month now I wanted to I didn't
want to do a first impressions on this
because I thought you know what the
price point on this is a little bit high
for the drugstore especially like these
are each $15 so I didn't want to do a
first impressions I wanted to try it for
a month or so and really get my feelings
towards it so I could share that with
you and let you know whether or not it's
worth buying or not there's too many or
nots so with that in mind there's only
one product I am only gonna be all
swatch for you because I can't wear it
it's the Gigi Hadid liquid strobe in
gold so I think this is like part of the
West Coast they have like an east coast
and a west coast line so this is like a
liquid highlight if you wanted to use it
that way and it really is gold I tried
it on my eyes once and it just smeared
everywhere cuz that's not how it's meant
to be used but I figure well I'll at
least try it just in case it works no
it's gorgeous so you have to have a
deeper skin tone for the gold and I
didn't get the other shade the other
shade might have worked for me it feels
like it's a nice quality I mean the
reality is you can get liquid
highlighters from every single brand out
there for cheaper than what this is so I
feel like it's just kind of a standard
feeling liquid highlighter you could mix
it with foundation if you want elf cells
ones like that like everyone does so I
feel like you could get them for even
cheaper and get the same thing it's just
got her name on it which is what drives
the price up a bit which I get and you
know we're dumb dumbs and we pay for it
but I guess I'm the dumb dumb because I
pay for these but I want to just with
some curious anyway so that's one that I
wouldn't not recommend but I don't think
it's like stellar out of this world but
yeah the gold would have to be if you
have a deeper skin tone alright moving
along
we're gonna put on obviously some of
this so I have the gigi hadid eye
contour palette the
is in warm and when you see this online
you're like oh my gosh that's amazing it
looks kind of like the naked basics
palette but like smaller and like that's
really cool and I was like that's
awesome
I was really genuinely excited for this
line and for this product in particular
when you get it even in the video it
doesn't do it justice these are the
tiniest pans when I opened it I thought
wait no no that what I just kept like
again like this doesn't I'm trying to
think of like okay here's a lipstick
compared to this like I don't know how
else to compare it alright we're gonna
compare it to the Naked palette shadow
size I think a lot of people can use
this as a frame of reference look at how
big the shadow is compared to that one
can you see they're tiny I just can't
stress that enough anyway so that just
kind of made me laugh and I'm like oh my
gosh like this is $15 totally inching
itself out of the drugstore price range
in my humble opinion and so for that
reason I was a little bit disappointed
but I was like well let's see if the
shadows are at least good so before I
put these on I also got this shadow
palette and I might throw some of the
shimmers on this is her eyeshadow
palette and warm the one that looks like
this again this is also $15 this
packaging is plastic and it's really I
actually really like it I love the color
of all this very reminiscent of the
k'kaw Beauty line I'm sure everyone
thought that I really liked both of
these this packaging is like that thick
cardboard and it magnetizes and then
this is plastic and it clasps shut so
we're gonna kind of use a mix of those
I've been using them for a while I'm
gonna put on the uLTA Beauty matte eye
primer and nude it's quickly become one
of my favorites because it kind of
cancels out veining on my eyes you know
and like little blueness from those
veins but it also is a really good
primer just on its own so I really I've
been really loving this I will link it
below I'll link all of these below as
usual I know she did not have an eye
primer in her range I was kind of I'm
curious to see if they're gonna expand
this line to have like blush and more
highlighting because they really didn't
have a lot of face products and I'm sure
they're kind of testing it out seeing
because I mean Gigi Hadid is absolutely
naturally beautiful it doesn't take
anything to make her beautiful just like
all of us but you know what I mean she
a supermodel and she's freaking gorgeous
so you know she could put on anything on
her face and we're all like oh my gosh
she's like I need that highlighter so
badly like I want to look like anyway
I'm cracking myself up I have like a
mini crush on her clearly all right so I
got my primer on always look at the
edges of your primer cuz that's where it
can look gross all right so here's what
we're gonna do we're gonna do this these
are all matte they are a little bit
powdery and some are better than others
some shades but when you're doing it
with a brush I do think it does a decent
job so let me show you I'm gonna put
just this you know kind of creamy ivory
color all over to kind of set that
primer and just kind of have a nice
color of a base that's not a color what
you know what I mean
alright so I feel like it kind of evens
it out obviously depending on your skin
tone other ones of those shades might
work better for you to kind of do
everything but for me that's pretty
close to mine so it works out for me so
what I'm gonna do next I'm trying to
look at both of these and make a
decision here let me go ahead and show
you some swatches of this I feel like
I'm all over the place sorry guys I
wanted to show you some of the shimmers
they're pretty but not great but again
swatches don't tell the whole story and
I really do think that's important with
especially drugstore eye shadows cuz
some cheap eye shadows will swatch
amazingly but look muddy on the eyes or
completely blend away and then others
won't swatch well and they do look
pretty so I already know how I feel
about these shadows but I want you to
kind of make your own decision first
before I share mine so I'm gonna use
this kind of mmm pinkish tone here this
is so like my brush is too fat for this
they're so thin okay
I'm blowing on it just deal with it and
I'm just kind of lightly putting this in
the crease I do like this color a lot
I've been using this like just in a lot
of palettes as my crease shades just
something different than just like a
uh kind of tan can you guys hear the
rain outside oh I love to use like this
anyone else love rainy days oh it's a
good storm it's like Saturday morning
forces you to say uh I don't need to go
out I don't need to go to the store I
don't need to do anything just gonna
chill inside so I've got that on this is
a kind of a step that I never worry
about it being perfect cuz I'm gonna
clean up up here I'm not big on taping I
don't know I don't have that kind of
time I just don't I know what adds only
like I'm sure ten seconds to your team
but I'm like I don't know I can't get
down with putting tape on it I don't
know why I've done it before and I was
like I'm saying that now and I'm sure in
a year I'll be like oh my gosh I can't
believe I haven't didn't using take this
whole time um alright so next thing I'm
gonna go into the other palette now and
I feel like this pink shade here and the
one in here might be the exact same yeah
that might be the only overlap there is
though I think the rest of them are a
little different so I'm gonna get hmmm
this dark purple shade actually let's do
a shimmer first I'm gonna get let me get
a good brush for it I'm gonna get this
gold well it's more of a bronze over
here and I'm just gonna Pat that onto my
lid and I want you to see what's
happening there's a little bit of powder
up there hmm
anyone else see that blow the powder off
your eye use your own judgement here I'm
just gonna keep going you think about
what I'm showing you you think about
what I'm showing you
that's such a good storm
okay can I tell you my thoughts now do
you see how patchy it is I mean it's
like patch city patch patch City I'm
gonna use my finger now these are all
the steps I've been taking all month to
try to make these shimmers work I mean
now I've got it everywhere crap and this
is the problem like because it I'm
trying to like clean it up with another
brush it just I could build and build
and build and it would look like okay
but it just like it it like skips that's
how I feel it like skip certain areas
it's the weirdest they get to be honest
they haven't seen this in a shimmer
shadow in a very long time there are
very thin consistency I've tried it over
a Mac Paint Pot it was a little bit
better you know you could use glitter
primer you could use mac fix+ but again
I'm like this is $15 at the drugstore it
should do a little bit better than that
I shouldn't have to make those steps if
this were $5 I might say oh I might be
willing but $15 is still expensive
am I crazy I don't think I'm crazy and
thinking that now let's keep going I
want to put a darker crown we're gonna
try to clean this sucker up because I
still need to film another video and I
don't want to look totally crazy and
also let go about my real life day again
don't want to look totally crazy I'm
gonna get a little bit of this dark
color this is the morphe know I'm not an
affiliate calm down in 441 I always buy
mine for cheap on HauteLook I don't use
anyone's code no offense to anyone cuz
some of my like favorite youtubers are
morphe affiliates but I'm not and this
brush kind of changed my life I'll talk
about in a video soon but it's the 441
it made doing the crease like more
pointed so much easier cuz I'm not a
makeup artist so we're gonna put this
just like kind of in the outer corner
here and down kind of into the outer V
really I do like this shade like the
actual color this video is gonna be so
long
here's the deal
with darker shades like this and I do
feel like it takes a little while to
build up but like here we go it's
already built up a lot so I was kind of
impressed with this shade I was like
okay like that's that's decently good
now here's gonna be the true test can we
blend it with a lighter shade so that it
doesn't look like all completely
different shades you know what I mean so
I'm gonna use this kind of topi pinkish
color to kind of blend all of that
together I'm using all kinds of shadows
kind of going above that color just a
bit gonna clean this up tinge on the
side here fall out here for sure
should have used tape I don't know why
I'm cracking myself up that that no but
really there really is fallout there's a
little bit of glitter there you guys
know how I feel about glitter I know so
many you guys love glitter I'm just
messing with you
I don't like it on my face but you guys
crack me up because right okay Jessica
gosh we get it like you don't like
glitter on your face shut up so I'm
gonna use that same dark shade on my
lower lash line do I want to use that
dark do I want to do more of like I see
they don't really have like a true red
these really are muted colors except for
like the one dark shade which I don't
hate because I am such a neutral girl I
really am so for me I don't hate that
but I know a lot of people would kind of
be turned off like can we get like one
more kind of medium dark shade like
maybe a red or a burnt orange just sit
have a little variation but you know I
like the color the colorway on these got
it right man I've all good
can you who Tyler listening to classical
music in the background he's in his
office look just like we share a wall
right there listening to him it sounds
like like minstrel meet like from like
the Renaissance I love on the way to
work I always listen to the like
classical radio station I freakin love
classical music and we took a field trip
recently to the like to the symphony
it's like the best day of my whole life
I love it so much okay let's try outs
I'm a pro liner shall we because this
will clean up this look a lot oh oh oh
well boom guys I'm taking way too long
to do this I'm so sorry alright so for
the brow bone I'm gonna get that one
shade I kind of put everywhere
even though this is powdery I have to
say though I like that like it
actually carries a punch which a lot of
ones that are like that kind of ivory
shade don't so I appreciate that that
one does little trick I learned from
Emily Noelle she's been putting like I
loved this idea like a lighter colored
shadow that almost matches her skin tone
in there just to kind of clean up the
look in there and I thought that is
genius so I've been doing that and it
really does I was kind of amazed at how
big of a difference it made anyway all
right let's put on some liner so I have
this Gigi Hadid what do they actually
call it gel liner in black I messed it
all up and it's all gross and dirty but
I feel like I have to sharpen it every
single day that drives me crazy and I
heard another youtuber say the other day
and it made me laugh out loud
she said it's 2017 I shouldn't need to
sharpen an eyeliner pencil anymore I
should it they should all be retractable
and still point you know what I mean
like there's so much technology out
there and it just made me laugh but I
will say about this I have been using it
a ton and it's very very creamy very
creamy I was very impressed with this
despite the fact that you have to
sharpen it so I'm gonna kind of tight
line first this tight line is turning
into more of a thick line but that's
fine that rhymed
you see a black tennis holy-moly it
really does glide right on like I'm not
pulling tugging I mean I pull on my skin
I know but it just glides right on it's
really it's pretty impressive
well this extended beyond a tight line
and I'm not hating it I'm not gonna use
a gel liner today because she doesn't
sell one and I want to use the liquid
liner she does you can see it so I'm
just gonna kind of thicken this line
just a little bit to look more like my
traditional liner look that I like okay
so we're gonna use her liquid liner
alright so this is the Gigi Hadid liquid
eyeliner has a felt tip which I
typically like it comes to a really nice
point which is great for creating a wing
it was totally up my alley let me start
with that I was like ooh this is my kind
of liquid eyeliner and I use liquid
eyeliner every day so I'm a freaking
snob because I found like the NYX epic
liner the NYX epic ink liquid liner best
liquid liner I've ever tried better than
every expensive one and it's like 6
bucks so I'll link that below the best
like the best anyway so it's hard to
compare well it's easy to compare and
say that that one wins versus everything
so with that in mind and how good it is
in the price point I think this is a
little bit more expensive if not the
same price so I'm just expecting a lot
so I'm gonna start by kind of stamping
I'm breathing so hard you could barely
like if you just like stamp it on yeah
that's alright
it feels like a crayola marker or rose
art it does like it can be kinda black
but it's kind of see-through black and
I'm like no I again it's 2017 there are
better liquid liners out there why
should I settle for this um but let's go
and finish the look because you know you
can make it work but it's so much more
work than I ever want to do
so there's that I you know when I'm
putting it if I were using this without
the other liner underneath it it
wouldn't cover the shimmer enough and
that's what I realized like after a few
hours of wearing it I would start to see
my shadow underneath it peep through and
I'm like nope don't have time for that
did okay we made it work but I wasn't
happy about it
so she I think she did have a mascara
but I didn't buy it cuz I was like no I
just didn't want it I don't know but she
did have a lip so let me go ahead and
draw some mascara on do the rest of my
face and then we'll put on the lip
products that I got from her well you're
gonna be mad at me just put on the lip
product and thought you guys were able
to see it and realize I hadn't hit
record
you didn't miss that much the lip liner
is incredibly creamy I mean it literally
just glides right on and so I have the
red and I have the nude I went with the
red because the nude lipstick was sold
out when I bought this a while ago but
the red one was not so the red is really
creamy I swear to you it's the exact
formula as they're like matte line the
Maybelline Max line which I know a lot
of people love it's a very almost thin
consistency which is kind of comfortable
and moisturizing so it's it's kind of
rare in matte lipsticks and I actually
do like it but the lip liner is so
creamy I feel like you could fill your
whole lips with it and it would totally
work does that make sense but I really I
think this red is such a firecracker red
it's so fun and bold and bright
comfortable to wear so in the end I feel
like what would I genuinely recommend
like what do I think you should run out
and if there's a sale or you have a
coupon what do I think you should buy my
favorite products were the even though
they're tiny and comical I do think the
matte shadows are pretty nice they kick
up powder they do and they don't swatch
amazingly but they really do blend
really well do I think you need to get
the ones with the shimmers no I know
they're pretty but I just think the
shimmers are crappy and because of that
like I could totally see myself honestly
throwing this in like a makeup bag when
I'm traveling just so I have all the
mattes I need and then just throwing a
couple like a palette with some shimmers
because I do think this is for me a very
comfortable
range it's got what I need and it blends
pretty well I also think the lip liners
and lipsticks are really really nice
again though the lipsticks are the same
formula in my opinion as their matte
lipsticks so if you find a shade you
know there's only like I think two
shades so if you don't like either one
of those shades maybe just go to the
maybelline mattes line and pick some
shades you like from there cuz I'm
almost positive is at the exact same
thing the liners are great too let me
swatch the nude one for you
these are retractable if I didn't say
that before really classic nude color
again incredibly creamy they stay on
pretty well throughout the day just like
any lip liner and I think that the gel
liner the one that you sharpen is
absolutely amazing the things I would
say maybe stay away from would be
definitely the liquid liner I think it's
just like I said the shimmer shadow
palettes I think are not worth it
and then this liquid strobing things are
okay if you can find a shade you like
but I don't think you're missing out on
anything by not getting it so I hope
that this video was helpful for you guys
I love filming these kinds of videos
especially after I've really gotten to
know these products so I can share with
you my thoughts and feelings on them if
you enjoyed it I hope you'll give it a
thumbs up subscribe hit that little
notification bell so you know when I
upload new videos and other than that
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
