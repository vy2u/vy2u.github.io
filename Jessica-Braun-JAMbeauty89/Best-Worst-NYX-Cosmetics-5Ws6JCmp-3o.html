going to share with you the best and
worst of nyx cosmetics i have tried so
many NYX products over the years and
it's it's kind of crazy as I went
through my entire collection and pulled
everything out I thought is this really
I have a lot but like the amount of NYX
that I've tried certainly Trump's the
amount that I currently have a lot of
what I've kept her things that I
genuinely really really love
but there are some duds here that I
wanted to mention so that you can avoid
at all costs so if you like this kind of
a video definitely give it a thumbs up I
hope that you'll subscribe if you'd like
these stuff this style these style slow
down
this style of videos I hope that you'll
stick around and catch some more of my
videos let's go ahead and get to it also
this top is from Kohl's isn't it kind of
cool it's got like good if I could do it
scalloped like bottom and it's like kind
of open in the back and then this
necklace is from Target okay so where to
start should we start with something I
didn't like let's start with something I
did not like it's the NYX ombre blush
this stuff looked so patchy when I put
it on it's in the shade nude to me and
it's kind of like this peachy you know
kind of the ombre idea but I've tried it
a few different ways and it just looked
crazy on me there's nothing wrong with
the color it's a pretty color it's
pigmented but when I put it on and look
okay but then like within an hour it
looked crazy like it just wore off
really weird I've tried it with
different foundations primers powders I
mean it hasn't seemed to matter anyway I
tried this it never looked good and I
don't know why so if you've tried any
other shades of this and you know that
they work well let me know what shades
below because I wanted this to work but
it just did not okay the next product is
an absolute favorite of mine it's the
NYX HD finishing powder and banana so if
you have ever tried the banana powder
from Ben Nye and you're like it doesn't
look good on me because maybe you're a
little fairer than that this is the
answer because a it's great because it's
not a loose powder so it's way quicker
to apply but I use this almost every
single day too
my undereye because I feel like no
matter what I use it always needs to be
set just a little bit and then on top of
this it brightens it so it's so quick
and easy I just grab a small like fluffy
brush grab a little bit and I put it
there and it just brightens that area so
well it stays in place it's so cheap
it's I'm never gonna run out of it cuz
that's the only area I'll use it there
and all sometimes use it on my nose and
like up here I love it so so so much
this is one that when I run out I will
buy again
next up is the NYX hydro touch primer
this is one of my favorite primers of
all time drugstore high-end
doesn't matter one of my favorites
because it's so hydrating I'll put on a
moisturizer and then I'll put this on
any foundation I put on top of it no
matter how drying the foundation is it
instantly looks like I have an inner
glow because of this I don't think it's
too wet and that's why I like it but
it's it's so good I always compare it to
my Smashbox the Smashbox blue primer I
have that too and in my recent dupe
video where I had a ton of dupes I can
link it below if you want to see it um I
compared these they are the same product
I swear to you did the same and this is
like under $10 and of course the
Smashbox one is I don't know like 30
bucks so this stuff is amazing run run
run out and get it I love it again when
I run out of this I will buy it again
okay
so if you're curious about what i'm
wearing my lips by the way it's one of
the super stay matte thanks like the new
one and i'm wearing this shade 15 lover
i really like it it's actually same on
way better than I thought it would to be
honest alright let's get going
another figure I've got like so many
favorites I just want to share the NYX
dose of do highlighting stick my
favorite my current favorite highlighter
I travel with this because you can just
grab it go CH and then kind of blend it
in with your finger you can get less by
just putting your finger on it and doing
it it is the most beautiful natural dewy
glow oh my gosh like this stuff is
amazing it's just the right amount of
creaminess where if it were too creamy
it wouldn't stay in place but if it were
less creamy it wouldn't be as easy to
blend
it's right in between and I think even
the packaging is cute like the font they
chose to use
I'm never gonna run out of this stick it
is amazing I don't know that there's
even a shade no it's just dose of do and
they call it by the way a face gloss
because it really does make it look dewy
and not like a highlighter stripe it's
amazing again any I think any version of
highlight that you like you would like
this because whether you like just a
little bit of a dewy look or if you like
a lot of highlighter you could use this
under a powder highlight and it would
really amp it up if you wanted to let's
talk about another dud this is the NYX
epic black mousse liner it is so dry and
I don't know if I got a dud or what but
the day I bought it at Ulta I came home
to use it and it was completely dry so I
don't know again let me know if you've
tried this are they all just kind of a
drier formula or what because I would
consider myself a cream and gel eyeliner
connoisseur because I love that style of
eyeliner I use it almost every single
day but I was very unimpressed with this
again let me know because maybe it's
that I got a dud but I've never really
heard anyone talking about this anyway
so if you're looking for a drugstore
cream liner try the L'Oreal lacquer
liner has a gold lid it's amazing also
the Maybelline eye studio one is just as
amazing I think I like the L'Oreal one
just a little bit better I'll link it
below back to my loves my oldie like
back to when I first started my channel
love and this is the second one I've
owned this is the NYX mega shine lip
gloss and beige of course it's pink it
has a very strong cherry smell so if you
don't like that stay far far away
because it's definitely strong but it's
just the perfect little sweet everyday
pink pretty sweet in there cute I just I
love this I think the formula is just
the right amount of creamy it's not
sticky
the pigmentations not too much but it's
not too light it just makes me feel very
put together when I put it on and also
just gives me the warm fuzzies because
again I love this back when I first
started my channel it has a little bow
on the lid which is really cute a very
popular NYX product is their angel veil
primer a lot of people compare it to the
a lot of people compare it to the really
expensive hourglass
mineral primer of course they both have
veil and it too they are very very very
similar I like both I will say this type
of primer is not my favorite kind of
primer because I tend to have dry skin
so for me it's not my favorite but if
you have oily skin you would love this
because not only does this soak up oil
but it kind of perfects your face it's
kind of pore filling and it sucks boil
so it really it does a lot of stuff and
they've kind of jacked the price of this
up I don't remember when it used to cost
but this was like $15 I was like mix you
are not supposed to be that expensive
I'm sorry you're not I don't care how
good the product is I don't know maybe
it's just me but I will always consider
NYX and drugstore brand so when things
are like $15 I'm like you might as well
call yourself freakin high-end that's
like almost the cost of a high-end
lipstick anyway I'm just being silly but
still it is really good so and of course
it's still like more than half the price
of this so it's still a way better deal
and they're very very similar so on that
vein the NYX pore filler I really do
like I think the reason I like this a
little bit more than that is because for
me I just have more uses for it I take
this and the angel veil is more of like
a white primer this one is like a beige
color almost like orange but when you
blend it in it really fills in your
pores so what I'll do I won't put this
all over my face I just put it on my
nose and depending on how my skin is
looking I might put it up here and here
I don't do it there as much because
sometimes that just makes it look worse
and like more cakey but it does a great
job on my nose because that's the area
where I feel like foundation slips and
slides right off of it throughout the
day and my chin too in fact I feel like
my chin it's already like wearing off
anyway so I love to put this in these
regions because it does a great job no
matter what your skin type is so this is
a fantastic one sometimes you can get
like a smaller size of this or maybe
this is the small size I don't know but
it's really it's a great primer alright
moving along to one of my holy no my
holy grail liquid liner of all time out
of every brand out of all price statuses
that's
out of all price levels the Knicks epic
ink liner is the best liquid liner I've
ever tried I've probably tried 4050
eyeliners both expensive cheap this is
the best one I've ever found isn't that
awesome
it's you know $5.99 it I just made a
really thick line it can make really
thin lines it can make really thick
lines it's incredibly black it stays put
do they claim that it's waterproof no
but I would almost bet that it would
hold up pretty well in water now if
you're straight up swimming I don't know
but like for example I was wearing this
yesterday and like a little like it was
a water slide and so you got a little
bit wet on your face it was just fine it
did not budge so this stuff is really
good it's got a brush tip like the Kat
Von D one does but it might as well be
felt tip because it's so precise and
thin that it kind of feels the same it's
great for doing winged liner oh my gosh
it is the best the best the best and
it's so much more inexpensive than a
bunch of other comparable liquid liners
this one's better let's talk about a
silly product shall we this is the NYX
lid lacquer I bought this because I kept
seeing like all these models and they're
like and they have like it would be like
nothing really on the lid but like a
gloss and it looks so pretty on them and
I'm like I want to try that I don't know
where I thought I was gonna get away
with this well I was like well NYX has
something like that let me just try that
and so it says it's clear and it says
make a dramatic statement on and off the
runway Knicks the Knicks lid Locker
delivers high shine for a glossy edgy
eye look this is the kind of stuff that
you put on and you open your eyes and
your eyes like you can't shut them
they're like stuck together it's like
peel peel peel like every time it never
dried down it looked it didn't look bad
but I put it on top of like I think
maybe a cream shadow and what it did is
it took the the cream shadow and it just
like totally it disappeared into all of
the lines of my eyes
and that never happens to me so I'm like
so it was definitely this which kind of
makes sense when you're putting on
something like this that never really
dries down but I even tried it just
alone and while it kind of did look cool
it would not have lasted longer than
like five minutes because it was so
annoying it was constant so I ended up
taking it off so kind of those things
there was fun to play with and I'm glad
I've tried it because I can tell you
about it but I'm like it's kind of a
silly product just silly you're just
silly but I mean it literally
texture-wise
it feels like a lip gloss you might as
well just get a clear lip gloss and put
it on there save the money because that
is what it feels like you put on your
lips that might be their lip gloss
formula I don't know moving along
another favorite of mine this is the NYX
control freak
eyebrow gel this is a clear eyebrow gel
that you can just I can put it on now
just put what is on my face okay you can
just put it on your brows and it kind of
combs them in place and what I
appreciate about this is that it doesn't
really it has somewhat of a hold but
it's not so strong that you just feel
like you have cement eyebrows does that
make sense sorry my hair air dried today
which is awesome I'm I'm very thankful
that my hair can air dry and not look
totally crazy but sometimes it still
looks crazy
anyway I really really like this stuff
it's this is probably like the fourth
one I've had of this because I always
buy that Anasazi one too but it's way
more expensive like three times the
price and now one has a really strong
hold but I don't necessarily need that
for everyday this is what I like for
everyday because it doesn't look or feel
crunchy but it holds your brows in place
I love it so I have to nix concealers I
wanted to talk about okay Jessica this
is not gonna work this way do very very
different concealers this one is the NYX
HD studio concealer I have the shade
fair which is like way too light for me
I don't know what I was thinking this is
just a very standard concealer I don't
think there's anything really overly
special about it it's not bad but both
of these sink into fine lines like most
concealers do I mean that's just kind of
a fact of life but this one's a lot
thinner and I just don't find myself
reaching for it very often because I
think it gives decent coverage it's
is brightening the shade that I have but
I just don't think it's anything to
write home about if you're looking for a
concealer and you're in the NICS aisle
and you find a good shade I think it's
good but I don't think it's like a
standout concealer by any means so it's
kind of I guess it's kind of one of
those matte products not bad but it's
not like needs a standing ovation now
the next one is the NYX of gotcha
Covered concealer I had tried this out
it's waterproof and it is waterproof I
tried it out in my waterproof video and
I can link that below I did a whole face
of waterproof stuff this was the
concealer I used and it does not move it
does not move I have it in the shade
light it's one of those squeezy tubes
and it's a very thick concealer but it
does a great job it hides any dark
circle I mean it hides whatever you want
it to hide it really is an amazing in
sealer now blending it in to try to look
natural is a little more difficult
because it's not it's not necessarily
meant to look natural it's meant to
cover a lot in which case it is gonna
look somewhat artificial in that way not
as they're in a bad way so like if I'm
filming I like wearing this because it
really brightens the areas I want
brightened and it gets that across but
if you're gonna be like up close and
personal it's definitely gonna be there
you're gonna see it but it still is a
really good concealer and for the price
this is totally a dupe for the tarte
maracuja creaseless concealer I've had
both I think I might like this one
better I think this one's a little bit
creamier but great coverage a really
good concealer if that's what you're
looking for another favorite of mine
that I didn't think I would like as much
as I do is the NYX eyeshadow base this I
got in white and I got it because I want
white for when AI want to cover like
veining on my like eyelid but it's great
because you can put it on and it
definitely is white but it totally
blanked out the area and any color you
put on top even if it's a neutral it
really makes them stand out in such a
way that I feel like it's really making
the eyeshadows do their jobs so not only
does it hold the eyeshadow in place all
day and kind of battle creases it just
does a great job of cancelling out the
area so you really have a blank canvas
do I wear this every day
they know because it is a little bit
more work to blend it in it's a creamy
formula but you want to make sure it's
kind of even and that takes a little bit
of time so while I think it's a great
product it's not for me useful for
everyday it's great for videos great for
tutorials and it's great for when you're
maybe going out and you really want your
look to look bold but I don't think you
need it for everyday does that make
sense a dud this is the NYX taemin frame
tinted brow pomade I had decently high
hopes because I like the anasazi of brow
pomade but I heard a lot of people say
this is totally a do it's just not it's
not I hate to call it a dud because I
know so many people like it it's just
not as easy to blend into your brows as
the Anasazi one is and I think that's
what you're paying for so if you just
want it for the color and you can make
it work and you're willing to put forth
the extra effort it's not a bad product
it's just not as good as that and so I
don't like to put my stamp of approval
it's an amazing product when I know
there are better products out there and
I think when it comes to like the price
point yes this is cheaper but the
anasazi ones around $20 and this one's
probably around 10 if you could save up
and get the Anasazi one these are gonna
last you a very long time even if you
use it everyday it just lasts forever so
that is one of those makeup products
that's probably a worthwhile investment
because they say they go bad in six
months but they last a lot longer than
that if you're really good with them
they really do and so it's kind of those
things that I would almost say it's
worth saving your money and spending it
on anyway so this is just a pretty much
a dud just because it doesn't work as
well but it's not horrible so maybe it
is kind of a matte product and I have
mine in the shade espresso by the way
more products so this is the NYX perfect
filter eyeshadow palette I loved this
stuff the actual shade is called
all of you and they have a few these
shadows are great quality they blend
really well they're super pigmented
they're big pans which i think is great
and while I don't use every color in
this palette like I don't really use
that yell
the green I sometimes use the purple not
all the time but they have this
beautiful map right here which I really
appreciate and this one's mad as well so
you can actually do some good looks with
them but mostly it's just the quality of
the shadows they're really pigmented
they kick up some powder but not too
much not so much that it wrecks your
look does that make sense but they're
also really blendable and they stay on
so all in all I think this is a great
palette now again their palettes can get
kind of pricey so I always wait for like
the Ulta buy one get one half off sales
just to make it a little bit more worth
your money but I'll show you some
swatches they're shimmers are gorgeous
the mats are gorgeous they're just
beautiful shadows I mean beautiful the
only dud in this is this weird shade
right there it's like kind of like a
champagne almost it literally just like
creates just a trail of glitter dust and
that's it I mean there's no payoff but
every other shade is gorgeous so you
know you got to kind of go into it if
you're really dying for this palette
knowing that all the other shades are
gonna be good but there is one total
done in there but it overall great
palette next product is this NYX first
base primer spray primer sprays are
interesting because every time I use
them I think is this working
like is it but the way that I like to
use them and I do like this one the way
I like to use them is I still put on a
primer but I'll do this like once I've
got my skincare on like I'll put like a
day serum on and like a moisturizer I'll
just spray this on and just kind of let
that soak in while I'm just I don't know
getting a YouTube video pulled up just
because I feel like it kind of helps to
kind of even out my skin tone and get it
ready and then I still put a primer on
so it really is an extra step that I
don't do everyday but I I never want to
just use these as primers I just don't
think it's enough and that's just my own
you know brain doing that to myself but
this one's nice I feel like it's kind of
and like I said I could just kind of
preps my skin for the day but you could
totally put this on first and then a
moisturizer if you wanted kind of like a
toner type type of a thing it says it's
a lightweight mist that creates a smooth
canvas for impeccable makeup application
again I don't think it works as a primer
alone that's just me but if you use this
and you feel like it really does let me
know and maybe I should try in a
different way but but I think it's good
and there are other primaries that are
much more expensive so if you're in if
you're just curious to try it I think
this would be a great one to try first
the last product I'm going to talk about
is the NYX skinny black liner this is
awesome if you like skinny liners
because like I love my hourglass 1.5
millimeter and actually I want to
compare yeah these are both just as like
the same size which is fantastic but I
just don't feel like it's as creamy as
the Argus the hourglass one is kind of
like unbelievably creamy and so that's
another thing where you are paying but
you are absolutely paying for quality
I've constantly looked for a dupe for
this hourglass one and it I can't find
one this is the closest I've come size
wise but it's just not as black and I'll
show you the swatches the one on the
right is the hourglass one and the one
on the left is the NYX the next one just
isn't as black it's not as creamy but
thin wise it's great because if you just
want to do your waterline or like kind
of tight lining between your lashes
these are great for that but you do have
to work a little harder because the next
one's also a little bit drier so you
know again it depends on what your
budget is the next one's not bad it's
still really good it's just not quite as
creamy etc but I will say like the
hourglass one you fly through I mean
it's so creamy and you use it up so
quickly so you would save a ton of money
go in the Nix row I hope this video was
helpful for you guys if you like this
style of video definitely give it a
thumbs up and check out my other videos
that I've done I've done like a wet and
wild whole brand review of best and
worst I'll link that one below if you're
