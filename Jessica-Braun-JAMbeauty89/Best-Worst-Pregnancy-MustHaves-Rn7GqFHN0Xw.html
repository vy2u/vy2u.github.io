with you all of my favorite products
I've used this entire pregnancy this is
my very first time being pregnant and
I'm at 30 just about 39 weeks filming
this and so I feel like I've got a good
handle on what I really used a lot and
what was absolutely worth the money and
a couple things that for me personally
weren't worth the money but it might be
for you so I'll try to explain that as I
go first thing is sleeping especially
lately but just kind of off and on I had
trouble sleeping and that's very normal
for pregnancy especially as you get
later on one thing that helped me big
time was this pregnancy wedge this was
like 20 bucks at the store you can buy
it online and of course I'll link
everything I can find down below with
prices so you can kind of budget if
you're like pregnant or you're
complaining whatever anyway um this
worked really well for me I would sleep
with it literally like beside trying to
think of how to show you like with it
like like this on the bed so it's kind
of pushing up my tummy and kind of
keeping everything a little more
basically a little less pressure on the
stomach since you have to sleep on your
side I really liked this now here's the
deal I bought this new goal and I know
so many of you guys love it because so
many of you guys recommended it and I
thought you know I'm gonna spend the
money it was too much for me but I'm one
of those people that like I have to pull
the bedspread out really if it's like at
a hotel and it's like the bedspread it's
tucked into the corners I have to pull
everything out I have to feel free while
I'm sleeping and this new hole because
of the way it like it's a big body
pillow that kind of comes around I can
put a picture of it on the screen now if
you've never heard of it but anyway it
was too much it was too constricting for
me and like the few nights I tried to
sleep with it I had the worst sleep ever
I was like having nightmares about being
trapped like I could not do it so you
need to know yourself as a sleeper and
if you don't mind if you like that kind
of constricted feeling you might
actually like it because I know so many
people love it because it can go between
your legs too and it does it all so
sometimes I would even use this between
my legs so some nights like my stomach
was feeling fine and I would just slide
it between my legs and that was nice too
so that was something that for 20 bucks
I'm like oh my gosh totally worth it and
then even after pregnancy like I said I
kids
put it between my legs while I'm
sleeping if I want to it doesn't matter
there's no rules so I loved loved loved
this I can't believe how much I loved it
another product and I do have some like
skin care products body care and oils
and stuff I'll talk about too but just
thinking of comfort one product I'm so
glad I bought and I almost didn't was
this maternity robe so every time I get
out of the shower once I've lotioned up
boiled up whatever I like to put a robe
on and put my makeup on and do my hair
then put my clothes on so that's a part
of my that's just the way I've always
gotten ready and so not having a robe
that fit was driving me crazy so finally
about halfway through my second
trimester I bought this this is the
Jessica Simpson nursing robe what I like
about it is it it's it's just a normal
robe it's got a little bit of lace and
stuff but what I liked about it is it
cinches at right up here right under
your bust so that way you've got room
for your belly to be in there but it's
still covered because it's made although
it's Ceglie nursing you can just but
even still so I guess what I'm saying is
this is worth it because not only did I
use it every single time I showered and
it covered my belly bump even even now
it still covers it as far along as I am
I can also use it nursing so I can just
kind of toss it on not necessarily after
the shower but you know over maybe a
nursing tank and still be able to pull
to the side etc I guess you could pull
any rope to the side either way it was
really nice to have so I'm glad I had
it's easy to wash I just machine washed
it honestly like every time I did
laundry
so that was worth the money another
thing that was not explained to me well
when I was first getting into this and
so I've learned as I gone is leggings so
I've gone through many leggings one
legging that I hated hated was from
Target and actually the first time I
bought it someone must have returned it
and they were like tears in the crotch
region and so I'm like what the heck but
I'd already like thrown the stuff away
so I couldn't return so I sewed it up
and which was fine whatever but in the
end the they were so they were like
leggings but they were tights material
really really constricting almost like
compression even though they weren't
labeled that way and they were supposed
to go over the belly which is
at least the first two-thirds the
pregnancy I liked the over the belly
things it kind of kept everything in
when you're in that weird in-between
stage and you're like I'm not I just
kind of looked chunky I don't really
look pregnant
I liked the over the belly ones because
it kind of smooths everything out now
further along I'm like and I want the
under the belly stuff because it's like
I just want my sock to be able to
breathe but those target ones and I'll
link them below I hate it they were like
20 bucks they they would slide down the
crotch would not stay up it would just
like start sliding down and if they were
terrible I hated them at the beginning I
tried them recently and I hated them so
don't put spend your money on those
unless you know you like that I ended up
really liking the ones that were just
kind of kind of more like stretchy
cotton type material so these are from
LA made maternity and I have I think
like three of these I have two that go
over the belly and then one that goes
under and I just wear those three like I
literally just every other day I have to
do laundry all the time
because I wear them all the time cuz
they're comfortable they don't slide
down they stay in place and they're not
so constricting that it's making me feel
like lightheaded you know what I mean I
literally felt lightheaded in the chart
once so really like these yeah I don't
think you have to buy this brand this is
a brand I just randomly found on I think
HauteLook and I just bought one loved it
and bought two more but just finding
ones that are really truly comfortable
for you trying them on before you go
home I wish I would have done that but
yes another thing and this is a pack I
just haven't opened yet these are from
Costco but just finding really
comfortable kind of less I don't know
like for me I'm used to and I just
always have liked sleeping in an
underwire bra but you know when you
can't sleep everything bothers you and
so for me I can't sleep without anything
I don't feel comfortable that way and I
know some people do so it depends on
your own comfort level but these are
great because they're just really
comfortable there's no wiring or
anything now after you give birth at
least from what I've been told and what
I'm planning to do
I've got nursing bras that don't have
underwire there are just some semi
support so you've got room as you're
growing and changing and all of that and
so
mess with your milk supply at all but
for right now I've really liked this
style of for all this kind I've bought
some from different brands it doesn't
have to be this brand this brand is
Felina like I said I got it at Costco
but just that that idea of you know a
little less constrictive up there it's
just comfortable when you're trying to
sleep okay a type of shirt that had I
done all of this over again I would have
bought more of these and less of like
dressy shirts are just these maternity
v-neck so I've got a couple brands this
is Isabel Maternity from Target they
have the ruching on the sides they're
really flattering on they're so
comfortable you can wear them just like
this you could wear a camisole under
them but I just I fell in love with
these I'm seeing now there's like a
little hole in it though but anyway so
this is from Target and they had
different colors and I think I oh my two
or three of those and then this is from
Motherhood Maternity and they have a lot
on their website then you can buy mother
of maternity - I think I bought summit
like Macy's as well and they had like a
crazy clearance so and you can still get
the size you have like this is extra
small that's the size I wore before I
was pregnant and it's extra small
Maternity so it still fits me even at 39
weeks pregnant so they're just
comfortable I realized they work over
leggings especially when you're just
pedaling around the house you can wear
them as pajamas you can wear them under
a kimono or a sweater depending on the
time of year they're so versatile and I
just I I think if I could do it all over
again I bought a lot of dresses I ended
up wearing these more often so I wish I
would have bought more of these instead
of more dressy stuff now the reality is
I was working most of my pregnancy I'm
finally off but working wise I could
still wear these to work but you know I
did wear those dress shirts so anyway
another thing I'm not gonna show you cuz
they're dirty but I own a few maxi
dresses the beauty of maxi dress is they
don't even have to be Maternity to still
work for a maternity depending on the
style so I have one that's not a
maternity dress but it totally works
even now and then I have one or two that
like one was my sister's and one I
bought that are just maternity dresses
that are maxi and they're great because
you can wear them kind of in the spring
and in the fall you can wear them all
summer long especially if you're
self-conscious but
your legs like for me as I've gained
weight I've gained a lot of weight in my
thighs and my legs and things and so I'm
a little self-conscious about that
so maxi dresses are perfect cuz I can
still feel a little breezy but I'm more
covered up you know and plus your bump
pushes like I'm wearing a dress today
and your bump kind of pushes the dress
out and up so it looks shorter than it
really is so if you're wearing a regular
dress you know okay so let's get into
some like skin care products some tea
and prenatal vitamins all kinds of
things I've been using so the prenatal
vitamins I ended up switching to I'd
been using one that I just bought at the
store and then a lot of my friends like
no no you need something better than
that
so I purchased the Garden of Life
vitamin coat raw prenatals these taste
terrible terrible terrible I struggled
so hard to swallow these and I don't
know what it is but they've got pretty
much everything you need my doctor has
me supplementing with more vitamin D and
with calcium so I'm still supplementing
with that but it's got I think pretty
much everything you need it's hard to
tell you always want to talk to your
doctor and fit you know with that it's a
very personal thing so and of course
doctors all have differing opinions on
things so this is what I've been
enjoying lately and I think if I were to
start all over I just would have started
with this and again you can buy these
online I'll link it below ok next thing
I want to show you this is the only like
snack I'm showing it is the perfect
snack this is from second nature it's
their wholesome medley I buy mine at
Meijer and not everyone has a Meijer
near them but I think they're sold like
all over the place and you can certainly
buy them online it's it's essentially a
trail mix but it's got nuts dried fruits
and dark chocolate chunks it's so good
you guys it's got a lot of protein in it
and that's perfectly sweet it is gluten
free if you're like my mom is gluten
free so she could eat this it's savory
and sweet it's got dark chocolate
lightly roasted and salted peanuts
almonds cashews dried cranberries and
dried cherries so that's all that's in
it it's so good and when I've had a
sweet tooth I can eat this and it
satisfies it or when I'm just feeling
like I've got a savory tooth this
savoury tooth tiger anyway this also
satisfies that so it's like the perfect
Tyler loves it too we loved this way
before I was pregnant but now I'm like
this really is like an ideal snack when
I'm just like hungry but I don't want to
eat something absolutely terrible I mean
yeah there's still sugar in it but at
least it's a little bit more natural
than just going to buy a Snickers I
could literally eat the whole bag it's
terrible um tea I've been drinking off
and on I wish I were better about
drinking this like every day but it's
the traditional medicinals raspberry
leaf tea friend of women it says it
supports healthy menstruation tones the
uterus and may be used for menstrual
cramps but it's been used for years but
raspberry leaf has been used for
thousands of years for menstrual support
cramps and during pregnancy as a healthy
tonic to help prepare the womb for
childbirth I like to throw a little
honey in this but I like it they also
have the traditional medicinals
pregnancy tea that has raspberry leaf
and a few other things I've already I
liked that too I've just already gone
through it and this is the next box I
had it's caffeine free herbal so I do
like it like I said it's it's not like a
sweet tea by any means and that's why I
throw a little bit of honey in it but
it's good and I like the idea that it
might be helping you never know I
already loved this before pregnancy but
it's so nice and gentle during pregnancy
I've had little bits of rashes like on
my arm there's the name for it with
pregnancy like what it is I can't think
of it now it's out my head but um this
cleared it up
it's the Aveeno skin relief fragrance
free body wash I have gone through many
of the normal sized so I finally just
bought the giant one with the pump
because I'm like I'm going through this
like crazy it cleared those up for me
and I just love this it's just gentle it
lathers really well it cleans my skin
but it doesn't dry it out completely it
does still have sulfates in it so there
is still you know that kind of foaming
agent that cleansing agent that can tend
to but it's got oatmeal in it too that
kind of helps soothe and that's why I
really really like this another thing is
this dry brush from Ecotools I've gotten
more into this later in my pregnancy I
wish I'd been doing it all along but I
used to be really good about dry
my skin it can help with the circulation
in your body the lymphatic system
drainage there's if you look it up
there's so much about dry brushing but
dry brushing during pregnancy is
actually recommended by a lot of people
and so I started doing this some more
it's that it can help with you know
helping your skin again kind of stretch
itself and get it used to I don't know
so I've been using it and so far 39
weeks no stretch marks on what I'm gonna
have them now that I said I'm gonna wake
up tomorrow but regardless I feel like
this is helped especially with my legs
as I've gained weight there it's kind of
helping keep them at least semi toned
throughout this whole process and that I
like so this just happens to be one from
Ecotools I don't know when and when I
bought this but I can link a dry brush
below I also switched to a fragrance
free natural deodorant during pregnancy
not really for any specific pregnancy
reason but more just I'd been wanting to
make the switch to natural deodorant
officially and I kept I would try a
natural deodorant and it'd be okay but
then I'd go back to like a dove one but
there you know if you look into it do
your own research I'm not a I'm not a
scientist with this but there have been
a lot of studies that have shown that
there are certain ingredients in regular
deodorants that can be harmful for you
in the long run so I tried the Schmitz
it's the one that's green it's got a
really nice smell to it and I really
really liked that stuff I've talked
about that way before I was pregnant
well I learned that they have a
fragrance free so this is the second one
of these I bought definitely no
fragrance here's the thing I don't ever
smell with this stuff it's amazing so it
actually works however you have to keep
in mind this is not gonna block the
sweat it really is simply a deodorant
not an antiperspirant because a lot of
the things that actually stop the sweat
are what is the harmful part of the
other deodorants that are out there so
even though I'm so sweating it doesn't
stink and that's my biggest thing
typically I'm like it's fine I don't
mind sweating it's natural we do it for
a reason but I just don't want it to
smell and this has completely eradicated
the smell and I love that so it does not
have aluminum no propylene glycol and no
artificial fragrance so very very cool
so my skin I've been using the
Neutrogena body oil this is the light
sesame seed or light sesame formula I
already have another one this one's like
gone actually I use this my entire
pregnancy so it used one full thing this
is the 16 fluid ounce I bought another
one because I'm near in the end and I
figure I'll keep using it after as my
skin hopefully slowly gets back to
normal I wanted to keep using it because
they say you can still get stretch marks
and things afterwards too so this is the
main oil I've been using it's I'll put
it on I'll kind of lightly towel dry my
body and just put it on basically from
here to my knees I don't have me Nike I
guess I can put it everywhere and that's
I mean certainly you can it's meant for
your whole body I just don't I just do
it basically from the bust down to my
knees so I'm getting my thighs my behind
my stomach my back everything and I feel
like it's really moisturizing and it's
thinking and right but you know before I
even hit the air outside of the shower
I'm already moisturized pretty well and
then I go in with this oh my gosh I love
this stuff I need to buy a new one I'm
almost at the end but again this lasted
me my entire pregnancy which is crazy
it's the Shea Moisture Roche mommy
stretch mark buttercream with passed the
floor and pistachio oils it smells
really nice it smells like pistachios
and vanilla something I don't know
here's the thing because it does have
raw shea butter in it it you literally
have to warm it between your fingers so
I'll get a little bit I mean you can
scoop it out still it's kind of grainy
and so you kind of warm it but it's got
this unbelievable oily moisturizing
thing to it and so I'll put it all over
it is so moisturizing I really feel like
this is the magic ingredient cuz once
you blend it in it's literally like an
oil and so I've used other you know body
butters and things and I just feel like
this is the magic ingredient I've been
using especially paired with this I feel
like they're so good so I will like this
below and actually while I'm finding the
link I might be ordering myself a new
one because I went to the store I think
I bought this on like Ulta or somewhere
and I went to a store to buy some more
and they didn't sell it they sold Shea
Moisture but they didn't have this I'm
like so anyway it's amazing seriously
amazing mmm another thing that I loved
it's plugged in kind of behind my bed so
I didn't want to pull it out
it's kind of old but a heating pad
here's the thing your back will hurt
while you're pregnant and there's not a
lot you can do about it you know you
can't there's only certain pain you can
only take tylenol and I'm like I don't
want to take tylenol all the time every
time I'm back hurts and frankly it
doesn't really work on it so with that
in mind I use the heating pad but I
would recommend getting one that has an
auto-off timer and kind of some
temperature controls so mine has like
low medium and hot you know what I mean
so I'd use it on low or maybe sometimes
medium but it would authorize you know
scorching my back all night long or
anything that way I can fall asleep with
it on and after five or ten minutes it's
turned off anyway but it just feels nice
it helped me relax and fall asleep
without having to use you know medicine
or anything else and that I thought was
pretty cool because it's kind of a
natural way to help with that kind of
pain even when my calves would be sore I
kind of wrapped the heating pad open I'm
awkward but I wrapped the heating pad
around my calves and fall asleep that
way and it felt so good it was like
immediate relief so heating pad with an
auto-off timer totally recommend and
you'll use it after you're pregnant
anyway just for other things they're
great to have if you don't already have
one the other things I just tried to
avoid skin care wise because a lot of
you guys have asked about that you can
do research for days and you will find a
million list with ingredient lists this
long of things that you should avoid
your pregnancy just try your best
I mean that's kind of was my motto I'm
like you know what I'm gonna try my best
to avoid these things but I'm not going
to obsess over it because I know I will
make myself crazy I don't use that many
skincare product so it was kind of easy
for me to kind of curate that down but
main things I tried to avoid were
anything with retinol retinol any of
that I haven't really gotten super into
that anyway so again that was easy for
me to cut out however after I get
through with all of this I definitely
plan to eventually start dabbling a
little bit more into that because it's
really great anti-aging skincare
parabens you want to try to avoid that's
hard there's parabens and a lot of
stuffs so trying to avoid that the
biggest one for me were BH a so like
salicylic acid making sure that I was
avoiding that I again I did my best
there it's usually like in chemical
exfoliants things like that which I
still did use
some throughout but you kind of have to
decide which ones you want to use and
figuring out maybe just looking up like
okay this product I want to use just
google it see if it's safe for pregnancy
so I hope this was helpful again I
always like to say I'm not a scientist
I don't know everything this is my first
pregnancy but these are the things that
have been working for me I'd love to
know what your pregnancy must-haves are
