going to be reviewing the best and the
worst of the new line at Sephora called
pretty vulgar now they sent me this
stuff months ago I finally got around to
actually starting to try it about a
month ago and I asked you guys on snap
before I even opened the actual make up
and tried it swatch to anything I asked
you guys on snapchat if you wanted me to
do like the first impressions or to do
like a legitimate review after trying it
for a while and a lot of you guys voted
for legitimate review because there are
a lot of first impressions on this line
on YouTube already because when it first
came out I removed like what is that
because it was so new so I pulled up the
pretty vulgar kind of like area on
sephora's website and they're kind of
the behind the brand paragraph is this
it says beautiful contradictions are all
around us why can't you have the
elegance of a swan in one moment in the
darkness of a razor and the next now the
choice isn't pretty and vulgar but to
blend blur and mix into a colorful shade
that is uniquely you it's actually kind
of a cool idea though because they're
kind of subtitle is a beautiful
contradiction and their packaging if you
look at it it's kind of like this
vintage II look like this is like this
kind of old-school drawn with pencil
kind of a bird but and it's got like all
of this kind of elegance and beautiful
patterns but the names of the shades or
the lines are really funny like the
lipsticks line is called berry berry
then with a smile and so I mean that's
the best way I can be example I can give
and so I've got a lot of their eye
products a lot of their lip products
brow products that I'm going to be
showing you a no and I also have blush
highlight things like that so there is a
lot more out there from this brand than
what I have tried what I'm showing you
they have a foundation I'm wearing
actually a bare mineral foundation some
other stuff I was filming as well today
but they have a mousse foundation
they've got a mascara that I didn't get
to try things like that they also sent
their nail polishes I haven't tried
those if you're interested in those let
me know I can maybe do a quick Twitter
review or I don't
no Instagram review something on those
once I have tried them before I did too
far to this video I hope that you'll
subscribe if you like these kind of
in-depth review and swatch and try on
type videos and other than that let's go
and get into it I'm wearing almost
everything I own from pretty vulgar on
my face today so I will show you inserts
of the video of me applying it as I'm
explaining these products if I'm wearing
it today so let's start with the
eyeshadow palette I know a lot of people
have asked about these I have two of
them this is their Nightingale palette
and this one is a kind of deeper the
name is very suiting for this it's got a
lot of deeper shades it's got a great
mix of matte and shimmer and they have
some lighter one so that you can
actually create an entire look which I
appreciate it
these are some well thought out palettes
the names are kind of fun like this is
pillow fight it's one of the lighter
ones I feel like these are pigmented
pretty much across the board but they're
not like urban decay pigmented I compare
so much to urban decay because their
shadows are just like loving to show you
so here's the original Naked palette
I've had this for years their shadows
even their matte are just a step above
when it comes to pigmentation of course
this actually that one looks pretty
similar to those so maybe they are doing
something right that's maybe a better
example it's just a little bit creamier
than these now that's not to say that
the pretty bolder shadows are bad
because I really really like them I
don't mind because I'm not a true
professional makeup artist and because
often when I'm going to work I'm wearing
a more like eyeshadow look if any I
appreciate that these shadows they do
have them deeper rich shades that are
pigmented but they have a lot of them
that are just easier to work with
because they blend better urban decay
shadows blend well but sometimes they're
so pigmented that if you accidentally
get it in the wrong spot it can be
difficult to get it out of that area of
your eye that you don't want them in and
so I appreciate that these are almost
easier to work with for that reason so
the palette I'm wearing today is called
earlybird I love this palette I've been
wearing it so so much it's totally a
Jessica palette if you're like me and if
you
like more neutral shades and just more
wearable but they do still have some
deep one so like traveling this is with
this pallet would be great because it
does have that good mix the only thing I
wish it had like if I'm just thinking
travel wise I wish it had like a matte
black I wish like every pallet had that
though because you can so quickly like
line your eyes with that and be done
anyway but today I'm wearing this so all
over my eyes I have the tweet shade it's
like a light pink but I'm just kind of
using it to kind of even out the skin
tone on my eyes and then I put rise
which is this kind of light beige shade
in the crease just to warm it up and
kind of prep it and then my main crease
shade is the shade chirp which is a
dusty kind of mauve these are all three
Maps so far so I put that kind of on the
outer corner and into the crease and
even a little bit onto the lid and then
I put all over the lids it's beautiful
champagne II kind of peachy champagne
color called shine and I just applied
that with my fingers today and then on
my brow bone I use this kind of wire
than that shine color called wink and
it's also shimmery and I put it on my
brow bone and then just kind of blended
it all together I love this palette
there's not a single bad shade in this
palette
they're so beautiful the shade chirp is
also gorgeous it's like this beautiful
kind of bronzy gold shade oh my gosh
I've done a lot with this where I'll
just put it all over my lid and that's
it blend it into the crease and go it's
so pretty this palette is one that that
is the best feeling peeling off that I
can't we just fit on there that long
anyway
this is one of those palettes that I
would go out and buy right now like if I
had seen it online and they hadn't sent
it to me based on the shades alone I
would have bought it to try it out and
then I would have fallen in love with it
the same because it's it's perfect it is
so so beautiful so perfect it's in the
packaging is that kind of like cardboard
feel but it's it's still nice so if you
don't like that kind of thing you might
not like this packaging but I don't mind
it as much especially when you know
there's not a bunch of extra room for
other stuff and then there's a nice big
meter
alright moving on the eye primer that
they sell is in this really cute pink
and white packaging I'm wearing that
today I've been using it a lot
very tacky but in a good way
because for me I wanted to be tacky
enough that I almost feel like I need to
set it with eyeshadow because that tells
me it's really grabbing on to the
eyeshadow but it's not grabbing on so
much that you end up with weird patches
because like it caught I always take a
light shade like that like pink one and
put it all over to kind of set this
before I go in and I've noticed it still
holds onto the shadow really really well
throughout the day do I think you need
to spend the price on this not
necessarily the Milani eyeshadow primer
is absolutely just a very very similar
formula but if you have like a gift card
and you were needing one this is a
fantastic one formula wise it reminds me
of the Too Faced shadow insurance
although I think I like this one better
than the Too Faced because it's a little
bit tacky err than this one is alright
let's keep going so on my cheeks I'm
wearing this blush this is the make them
blush blush in the shade mirror mirror
and it's this really really vibrant
really pigmented pinkish peach and it's
got this gold shift to it like a very
obvious gold
it's punched up so much that well I
think it's a beautiful blush and it
stays on really really well I think it's
just a little bit too shimmery for what
I like too gold shimmery now if you have
a deeper skin tone than me you would
love this but they have other shades I
would totally recommend the formula of
it so this is something that I'll keep
trying out for a little bit longer but I
could see myself eventually to
cluttering this packing on - I've got
two sisters that have way deeper skin
than I do they would absolutely love
this so look for the shades that you
know would fit your liking but the
formula is amazing I mean it's
incredibly pigmented it stays on all day
you have to be very very careful
applying it but I would be curious to
try a lighter shade that's more suited
to my skin tone oh and let's talk about
the packaging
I remember seeing I think toffee talked
about this and she mentioned how the
packaging felt kind of cheap I don't
think that's true for all of their
products at all I really don't I do
agree when it comes to like this blush
it looks really high-quality doesn't it
gold all around
but it really is like a cheaper plastic
like a drum store kind of feeling
plastic but that being said if you
really think about like max maca blushes
for example they're just a cheap plastic
too and if you really like I guess
that's I literally just opened my blush
or to look and I'm like wait a minute a
lot of them are kind of and this is
actually thicker plastic than a lot of
them anyway
and it still claps really well so I
think it's one of those things that you
look at it and you just assume it'll be
some kind of metal or plastic because
it's a look and when it's not you're
like oh it's just different than you
expected but I don't think this is going
to break anytime soon so don't let that
totally turn you off from it because it
really is nice the highlight I'm wearing
today
holy moly it's their shimmering Swan
glimmers of VF highlighter this is so
unbelievably hi lady hi FedEx truck we
ordered some things for our house and
I'm hoping some of them are coming today
anyway um it's so highlighting like from
the moon you can see it beautiful but
what I like about it is I think you can
still get away with it for everyday I
don't think it's like so much that you
can't you do need to use a light hand if
you don't want it to be super obvious
but it's really really pretty really
creamy really creamy now yet again do I
feel like you have to go spend this
amount of money for this not necessarily
for example my favorite the pixie
highlighters are a little bit cheaper
they're still pricy now I do think they
kicked up a little bit more powder than
the pretty vulgar one did but I love
both i would recommend both so those are
my thoughts on that let's talk about a
dud all right it's the rising arc
eyebrow gel again beautiful packaging
like nice rose gold lid it they said the
shade twisted tail but it's not the
shade the shades not perfect perfect for
me but it's not the shade that I have a
problem with when I compare this to the
Anasazi a dip brow because price-wise
easier close this on the side you dip
our iPad for quite a while in fact
longer
I probably should have had it and it's
so ridiculously creamy like I'd barely
touch it and it's like the muck I mean
it feels like almost like a cream shadow
that is how creamy it is even still
after having it for a long time this one
already is like kind of dry like putty
and so it takes a lot longer to get it
and it's still creamy of course it's
like not doing it justice it's still
creamy but the anasazi one really is
just leaps and bounds above it and when
I tried to blend this one into my brow I
felt like it was just kind of spotty and
it wasn't as easy to get an even
coverage through my brows because the
the main thing you have to keep in mind
with these and they actually have a
really good eyebrow brush like a dual
ended one I really like it is once you
apply it to your brows you've gotta
brush through it to make it look a
little bit more natural at least that's
what I do and just to spread out the
color more evenly and anasazi one does a
great job but I just feel like this one
kind of missed the mark it was just a
little bit spotty it reminded me of the
l'oreal one which is actually pretty
good I think the L'Oreal one might be
better than this one so if you're on a
budget try to L'Oreal one if you are
wanting like maybe a little bit more of
an expensive what I don't know the
anasazi one is fantastic otherwise I
would pass on that but the brush is
really nice so moving on let's talk
about some oh well let's talk about an
eyeliner there's that is just incredible
this is there the ink in the shade
blacklist
this is an amazing liquid liner I'm
wearing it today over there pencil liner
which I'll talk about in a second it
looks like a little ink quill or like a
little ink pot and I made the mistake
the first time I used it they also have
a liner brush that's really good it's
dual and it's pointed one in an angle
one and when you dip it in it's really
soft like it's like think about butter a
lot of them are like butter when you
take it out of the fridge but this is
like butter after it's been sitting out
for a while it's very soft not in a bad
way it looks like ink okay it's like not
instant
that would be like a liquid life anyway
so you dip your brush in and it just
glides right on and it took me a day or
two to get used to it because it's you
know I'm not used to this soft of a
cream liner but it's so creamy it just
glides on this gonna last me forever I
feel like I don't think it goes all the
way out like that but it's still going
to last me quite a while it's got six
grams yeah it's a little bit more than
some other ones so anyway the packaging
is cool it's an amazing product probably
when I run out of this
I might purchase it again because it's
just it's related I'm so excited about
it okay so what I am wearing on my brows
today by the way is their quick wit
eyebrow pencil or I guess mine's in the
shade quick wit and it's got a angled
kind of like triangular pencil on one
side and then it's got the spoolie on
the other I love it I'm wearing it my
brows today and you can see me applying
it it glides right on it brushes right
through really evenly it stays on all
day I mean it's the perfect it reminds
me of the hourglass one it they're both
very very similar I really really like
this I love the packaging as well so I
mean this is one that I I just love it
it's making getting ready so quick in
the morning and I appreciate that and I
haven't quite found a drugstore I found
plenty of high-end ones that are similar
to this like I mentioned our last one
the Anasazi a triangular one they're all
very similar
but this one was really easy to blend I
haven't found a drugstore version of
these kinds of pencils that are just as
good I guess the rub sinks if you know
of any let me know below three liners
from them and these are the creamiest
freaking things in the world I have the
black shade which is called confidential
and if they retractable liner so it does
lose its point after a while ah it does
have this sharpener so you can pull out
the back and just kind of shape it I
always forget that a lot of products
have that which is really nice anyway
but I tight line with this and it's so
creamy and it looks so black that for
the past few weeks I've just been tight
lining and kind of like grabbing a brush
and blending it a little bit and then
that
sit and it looks like I spent a lot of
time getting ready but I really hadn't
and it stays in place it's so so creamy
mmm I love it now the brown one just the
same today I put it on my lower lash
line just really quickly but it's just
this creamy intubation place and then
they have this white one which is called
blank page system mixing with a Taylor
Swift song which was my alarm for the
longest time and Tyler literally this
morning was like Jessica I cannot listen
to that song anymore
I'm changing your alarm so you changed
it for me but it was my alarm for a very
long time anyway so it's an ivory color
I have it in my waterline on the lower
of lashline and it just brightens the
area does a great job at that I know I
mean honestly I haven't noticed it
wearing away but I have to admit I feel
like I haven't really like checked and
thought to look just at that part the
days that I've worn this but like I've
had it on now for probably a couple
hours and it looks exactly as it did
when I applied it so that's pretty good
because I do know there are some that I
like that I'll do that and it's gone in
like an hour so so far it's already
holding on longer than other ones
veterans next up our lip products
they're packaging with our lip products
are so it's so so so pretty so I have
these two that are in like a white pink
and gold packaging in there this one
that's in like a blue that's what I'm
wearing today this one is their stick to
the story in master manipulator and it's
one of those like goes on pretty much
clear and it's like I like to call it
like a mood ring lip gloss because
that's like what I've been obsessed with
I've been wearing this a ton I'm wearing
it today because I was like I don't
really want to wear red lipstick with a
red shirt it's a lot of red and I didn't
have any nude ones other than one I'll
show you to wear today that would look
right so anyway so I just wanted this
and this is what I've been wearing like
to and from running errands and just
living my life in the summertime it is
beautiful I love it I'm wearing today
with nothing else and I think it just
makes your lips look alive and it makes
them feel very very moisturized it
doesn't dry them out so as it's wearing
off it doesn't feel gross and you can
apply without a mirror I mean it's like
a
audicence oh I love this there are other
lipsticks the line is called bury them
with a smile I mentioned earlier and I
have the shade zero nine backstabber now
this is a very perfect for fall kind of
a color I mean it's that classic kind of
burgundy but like a muted burgundy these
are very very creamy you have to wear a
lip liner with at least these shades
because they're the only ones I've tried
this one is in the shade mood swing and
it's a beautiful bright pink but again
super creamy they stay in place for a
while I mean these are not like dry down
matte stay on all day kind of thing
these are just you know lipstick but
they're really really creamy they have a
really cute like emblem owes a little
pretty vulgar bird kind of in there
engraved in there if you will but I
really like the lipstick
but like I said you have to wear lip
liner because they can look really
really messy they're not necessarily
running but they're I mean it's kind of
like with a lot of lipsticks that aren't
matte matte matte lipsticks they can
tend to just look messy at the edges so
you have to with these so for that
reason I haven't been reaching for them
a lot because I like to grab a crazy
punchy one put it on and it'd be good to
go so just keep that in mind if you're
looking at these or if you're just in
love with these shades I mean this one
really is cool for fall now I have two
lip glosses when I also have two matte
lip colors so the lip glosses have to be
prettiest
again just really it's a thicker lip
gloss like I mean the packaging is
thicker with the gold and then it's got
these really pretty like blue flowers
and it's kind of got this like matte
feel to it but this I've been wearing a
ton it's their poisonous pout and these
are their plumping lip glosses and this
isn't a shade secret weapon it's just a
really neutral warm pink it's not
anything that's going to totally change
your lip color so again you could
totally do it without a mirror it's just
pretty it's just a really pretty
standard pink lip gloss the plumping I
don't notice like true true plumping you
get like a little bit of that feel but
it's nothing crazy strong which is nice
so I don't mind wearing it like when I
were to buff someone's those are like
you know you're wearing it
you're very aware of it and I don't mind
that sometimes but for everyday I don't
want that feeling all the time so I
appreciate this and then the other shade
in that same line is called cursed and
this one can look messy because it's a
dark deep shade and gloss form and it's
not a matte lipstick so you either need
to line your lips and then put this on
or put this on like over a complementary
lipstick because alone it just looks
messy but it is a pretty color I think
that'd be a pretty color for the
holidays you know a nice juicy deep red
and then the last ones are there
my lips are sealed liquid lipstick so I
have artful deception and this is like a
very kind of greyish taupe kind of a
color these are very moosie formula for
a liquid lipstick very very mu see they
have a shimmer to them so they are
different than what a lot of what's out
there this is called made with mischief
and it's a deep purple they're
surprisingly comfortable I will say that
but of course these are colors that I
would not necessarily wear myself but I
know a lot of people would look amazing
in this shade so they're really fun
shimmery but my favorite part about
these is the Moosey formula because I
haven't really tried anything quite like
this that's claimed to be a liquid
lipstick but I think out of all of their
lip products my highest recommendations
would have to be for their stick to the
story like kind of mood like lipstick in
master manipulator and then they're
plumping lip glosses I think are really
nice and none of them I just smelled all
of them none of them have a noticeable
smell so if that's something that
bothers you I don't think you'd be
bothered by any of these which I
appreciate cuz lore'l those are the only
lipsticks that I'm like I cannot do it
this smell makes me sick to my stomach
and I'm not normally like sensitive to
smell but it always has made me feel
sick so I think all in all I decided to
pick a top 3 from the brand that I think
you if you're dying trying to brand the
top 3 things that you have got to try
would be the ink which is that the cream
liner because it's not like anything
I've ever tried and it is so so good so
that would definitely be up there if
the earlybird palette is just if this is
up your alley you'd love it try any of
their palettes they have at least one
other one I saw that was a lot more
colorful but I just think this palette
is outstanding and then I think for my
third one I might just go with their
liners I just think they're so creamy
now again can you get this at a
drugstore price totally the NYX light on
ones are amazing
the any of the pixie ones I love the
pixie ones like they're waterline ones
so there are ones that are more
drugstore pricing that are totally great
but I just I really can't stop using
these so these I just recommend because
they're really good but you could
totally get it for cheaper but these two
I think on their own stand alone are
amazing so those are my feelings on the
best and worst and kind of the mess of
their new line at Sephora I'm excited to
try some other stuff they had a bronzer
I saw that I'd be interested to try and
just other piddly little things that I
would love to try but all in all I was
pretty impressed especially considering
I felt like a lot of the first
impressions I've seen were not negative
but kind of negative and I was like I
actually was pretty impressed I think it
just took time to get used to them
because a lot of them when I first used
in I was wearing one but it just took
time me getting used to using these
types of products so if you like this
kind of the video give it a thumbs up I
hope you'll subscribe before you leave
definitely check out more of my review
videos on my channel I can link my
entire makeup review playlist down below
if you want to see some drugstore ones
