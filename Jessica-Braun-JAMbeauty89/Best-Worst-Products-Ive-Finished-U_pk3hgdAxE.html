empties for you I was thinking about it
and I realized that I feel like empties
videos are one of the few like original
YouTube makeup type videos that to me
haven't really gotten old
because empty I mean they're always
changing and it's like we've like all of
us say when we start videos like this
it's just awesome because you really
know like how someone feels about
product they've used it up now there
might be some cases where I didn't use
it up because I hate it so much so I was
like I'm done I'm fed up it's going in
the freaking trash or recycling whatever
let's just go ahead and get into it
you're wondering what I'm wearing on my
lips I'm wearing sweet and sour
that's the shade name and it's the Too
Faced melted Matt I don't think I love
this formula I really like the color I
think it's fun and bold and bright but I
literally just applied it and I already
can like see some separation I don't
know like I just don't think I like the
formula it's fine for filming I don't
think you should run out and get it even
though I know the shade is pretty fun
okay so I'm gonna move this out of the
way maybe next week but no it's still in
the way alrighty let's go ahead get into
it so first thing on top I got rid of I
just hated so much this is the pixi
nourishing cleansing balm okay it's not
like the worst product I've ever tried I
thought it would be like the like a waxy
like cleansing balm that you can mix
with water to get your makeup off which
is what I like I use there's a cosmetics
one that I love that I can link below
and there's the clingy oh here it is the
Clinique take the day off so you put the
bomb on and kind of rub it in and that
kind of melts your makeup way then I mix
it with water then I go in with the
cleanser I love that well this is
nothing like that this you have to wipe
off with the tissue as you would like
with cold cream or something like that
or with the cloth I just don't like it
it has these weird bumps in it that
freaked me out I'm like is it bad I
don't know
I thought the smell was horrible it's
kind of a fresh smell but just a little
different some people might like it I
mean it doesn't it smells clean but it's
like way too much at the end of the day
when I'm trying to take my makeup off I
just feel like it's not good for my skin
because of that ridiculously strong
fragrance so I used it maybe two or
times and I was like peace I don't like
it next thing I'll go ahead and talk
about really quickly the Clinique take
the day off
cleansing balm this stuff is amazing so
is there cosmetics I think look the
Clinique is cheaper but I have like one
or two of the cosmetics back on back up
I love it so much they're so good
they take your makeup off really quickly
I always travel with it as well because
then I don't need like a liquid
you know club like micellar water I'm
kind of moved I've kind of moved on from
those for the time being but these I
love all right
um okay this is the Bliss fab girl slim
you might think it's this fat girl slim
it doesn't skin firming cream with
encapsulated caffeine um I've had this
for way too long so there's a little bit
in the bottom but I was like I think
I've had it for too long
I don't even is there even a date or
like a number of months no but it's been
too long
um do I think this made my legs feel
tingly and like it was helping with like
cellulite and things like that sure it
felt like it was due I think it actually
did mm-hmm
I don't I don't know I mean the reality
is cellulite is what it is and well I
don't think I have like a terrible
amount I think most of us have some of
it and um I don't know I don't think
it's worth the money I think I got it on
HauteLook for a little cheaper so at
least I didn't pay like full price for
it but I am sad that this is empty and I
almost have a second one empty the this
is the best hairspray in the freaking
world I used it today it does such an
amazing job at getting rid of most of
your flyaways without making your hair
look crazy like it doesn't feel crunchy
but it feels like textured it smells
amazing I could talk about I have been
talking about this for years and years
and it's still my favorite I've tried so
many I've tried way more expensive this
is still expensive
it's like eighteen to twenty dollars
however Ulta a few times a year has a
sale on these where they're $7.99 that's
when I go crazy and I buy like four that
way I'm set for most of the year cuz I
don't I don't use hair spray every
single day like if I'm dry shampooing my
hair I don't need more hair you know
what I mean so it smells amazing it's so
effective you can brush through if you
want you can finger comb through your
hair it is the best I've never if you
haven't tried this and you've been on
hunt for good hairspray just try it wait
for a sail but try it
I would pay full price I have before
like when I ran out and I was desperate
on my fine I'll pay it
I know target will have like two packs
of this for maybe like 25 so at least
it's a little bit cheap or something
like that anyway it's the best and I
wish you could smell it through the
screen because it smells so good
alright next empty is my ELF hydrating
bubble mask I really liked this stuff do
I think it was like the most hydrating
mask in the world no but it's enjoyable
it's not crazy expensive it's kind of
dirty but you push this I think there's
a little bit left
yeah there's you push this and the
product comes up into it you put it on
your face I think your face has to be
damp
I don't remember it's been a while yeah
you put a thin layer all over your damp
skin and after a minute or two bubbles
kind of start to form and it kind of
tickles and feels good it's I think more
fun than defective but it is fun and if
you've never tried one like this it I
mean it's pretty affordable and it's
just cool I ended up using all of it I
guess except for a little glob and I
really liked it the downside is it's
really hard to tell like how much more
I'm like wasting but it was fun do I
think it's like life-changing no so like
maybe if there's like a really good sale
and you need like five more dollars to
get free shipping and it's 50% off then
maybe that would be the time to try it
next product I am actually out of and I
have not worn my hair naturally curly
because I'm out of this like I feel like
I cannot I say curly it's more wavy I
know I've just like been in the habit my
whole life of saying naturally curly
just cuz I don't know I just have anyway
this is the Rusk wired flexible styling
cream this stuff is amazing I usually
find it cheaper at like TJ Maxx or
Marshalls
it'll be like eight dollars versus like
I don't know 20 I don't think I've ever
bought a full price so I need to go and
see if it's there it usually is it it
just does such a great job of keeping my
curls together do I have another empty
of my I think I already had it empty and
I have another one the living proof like
mousse is the other thing like these two
together alike ha like perfect I all
work on once I get another one of these
I'll work on a video to show you how I
do it because I know a lot of you guys
are asking for an updated one but this
stuff is amazing
holds your curls to get
there or your waves whatever alright
next up is the Brio Geo
don't despair repair deep conditioning
mask it smells really nice it's for your
hair you leave it in you could use it
every single freaking day if you want
it doesn't weigh it down but it does
moisturize it my husband even use this
and he liked it I really do miss it I've
got a lot of other I mean the thing is
deep conditioning mask there are a lot
out there but a lot of them for me
really do weigh my hair down my hair is
not super thin but it's also not super
thick unless it's natural in which case
it'll look thicker but at its core it's
really not super thick so I feel like
this is a great answer to that because
it'll still moisturize it my hair still
can be really dry but it's just really
good I really I miss it already
all right next up oh I didn't like this
stuff this is from Lucetta Lucetta
Beauty it's their dry shampoo the shade
is orange blossom I'm like nervous to
smell it it doesn't smell bad it
definitely smells like oranges and it
kind of is a good smell but there's
something about when I would use it in
the mornings I'd be like oh like I just
couldn't handle it and you smelled it
all day long like other dry shampoos you
know after a while you don't smell
anymore
you smell this all day long and it just
started to make him feel so sick to my
stomach this was months ago so I just
feel like it's it's just time I think
there's maybe this much I tried and
tried I'm like I've got to use it up I
can't do it it did an alright job as a
dry shampoo but it was the smell more
than anything that killed me and I again
I got that on HauteLook out of Steel I'd
never heard of the brand I just wanted
to try it alright some quick empties the
crest 3d white is what I use on my teeth
whether it's good for them or not I know
some people think but that's just what I
use this is the Schmitz bergamot and
lime deodorant that I love the only
natural dye owner I like that one is
empty and kinda gross alright Paula's
Choice resists serum I like broke this I
wrote it but it's mostly gone and again
I've had this one for a while this is
like this second or third one of these
I've had it's a really good serum it's
wonderful for anti-aging it's good for
sun damage things like that and I really
do
but I've I'm excited to try other serums
as well so kind of bittersweet next
again this one was almost gone the
glossy a milky jelly cleanser I had
started to wonder because this does have
a slight smell yeah I had started to
wonder if this was breaking me out and
that's when I switched to a different
cleanser I mean I've gotten almost all
the way through it but I just noticed my
skin kept breaking out and I really
liked it it reminds me a lot of my
favorite serum a hydrating cleanser but
there's this smell to it and I wondered
if that fragrance is what was setting it
off because the rest of it felt so nice
on my skin very reminiscent of my
favorite but I don't know and so you
know about this much left and I was like
I'm done I'm not gonna force myself to
use it if I think it might not be doing
good stuff for my skin next savatthi ago
the Brazilian boom boom cream one of my
favorites from Sol de Janero Janeiro oh
it smells so good I have the body spray
as well and it smells just as amazing I
want to like take that body spray and
just like pour it into other lotion and
just mix it and see there's no way that
works right would that work
I'm trying to think of like the science
behind it would it work I mean right
that would have to work right you just
dump it into the like plain scented
lotion just would it smell weird after a
while because it's not meant to I don't
know it kind of makes me want to try
like a little batch of it and just see
that I love the smell this it's so
moisturizing it's so expensive though so
again this is one that you know maybe
wait first before a vib sale kind of
stuff or wait you have a coupon whatever
but oh some makeup empties let me finish
the skincare ones first though oh all
right the Clinique prep start eye cream
was just okay I saw that it like won an
award like an allure Beauty award and I
was like what why like I used this
entire thing up and I did not feel like
it did anything like I didn't even think
it was very more I would use it in the
mornings as my like I moisturize err I
don't even think it moisturize well then
I don't know so that was just odd I mean
it didn't like ruin my eyes but I don't
know this was actually Tyler's empty
derma e hydrating serum with higher
acid he said he really liked it he's
getting into more skincare and stuff and
of course I'm just like spoiling him
with skincare I love it and teaching him
all I know but he said he really really
like this I typically really like derma
e product okay the Laneige water bank
moisture cream holy moly such a good
product so so good I'm telling ya but I
will say this about it it does have a
slight fragrance but my skin loved this
stuff I genuinely miss it I'm using a
drunk elephant one it's like the souffle
kind of moisturizer and I just don't
think it's as moisturizing as what I
need for my skin I loved this stuff so
much all right we've got some makeup
empties none of these are gonna surprise
you first one it's just time I hit pan
and then it got really gross because I
was using it with a wet sponge stop
telling on me it's the it cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination
powder foundation the best powder
foundation I've ever used in my life I
still have not found an exact dupe I
found some things that come close but
this is better than anything I've ever
tried it's worth every penny I've got a
rebuy it again because I genuinely feel
like there's a hole in my makeup
collection and when I'm like packing for
trips I'm like this is what I want it
does everything it is so so good so it's
got high coverage it doesn't make your
skin look dry or cakey it like perfects
your skin but it looks like lit from
within I don't understand it and there's
no like glitter in it it's just like
there's just some quality to it it just
looks so beautiful next empty is the NYX
epic ink liner I pretty much always have
an empty best liquid liner I've ever
seen
ever used and seen I guess it's so good
it's a felt tip reminds me of like the
Kat Von D the only thing is and it's
super black the reason I stopped using
it is because because I guess it's
because of this the thing gets all
frayed earlier on then when it dries out
and so it's impossible to use without
getting little bits everywhere so that
is the one downside like but it's like
$5.99 and it's so good it stays on all
day it's insanely black super precise
until the thing gets frayed and then
it's not precise at all speaking of
precise this is the hourglass 1.5
millimeter I used it every time I buy
one I use it up
come on it's in the shade obsidian my
favorite it's a super black there's just
a little tiny bit left super black tiny
tiny things so like talking about
tightlining
holy moly this is like the ideal tight
liner I love this eyeliner it is my
absolute favorite but I'm trying to
force myself to use other things but I
love it I have to empty lash paradise is
because these tryouts so stupid fast but
they're the best mascara the thing is
I've realized because a lot of people
are like I don't get it
I you've tried it I hate it I think I
realize what it is you have to really
like like quick mascaras that add volume
but it's super dry so that means it can
look really clumpy so you have to kind
of take the time to make sure you brush
it out maybe between layers for me if
it's under a month old I can do it too
and it looks unbelievable perfect there
might be a couple clumps I kind of pull
out and that's that but if you like
really really precise things you're not
gonna like this mascara it's really not
it's game now do am I saying that it's
like insanely weird and clumpy no it
just looks like feathery and like velvet
lashes that doesn't make sense but like
there it just looks so natural like
little like oh my gosh I love it so I've
gone through a million of these and I'll
keep buying them they're so so good so
those are all of my empties gorsh I'll
link my most recent empties video if you
want to see like the one before this one
