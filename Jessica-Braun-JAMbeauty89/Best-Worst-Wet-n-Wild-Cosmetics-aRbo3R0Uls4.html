going to tell you guys about some of my
favorites from one brand and the one
brand I'm going to talk about today is
wet and wild one of my favorite brands
one of the cheapest you can find in the
drugstore so let's go ahead and get into
it I'm wearing as much of this as I
possibly could today except for like
I've got a couple lipsticks so I just
you know had to pick one um but they're
actually everything I'm gonna mention I
like but there are a couple that I
wanted to mention that are not
necessarily my favorite that I figured
might be worth mentioning just so that
you maybe you can avoid them if it's
something you wouldn't like but let's
start with some of the things I love so
we'll go ahead and start with lipsticks
cuz they're kind of the ones that I
think of when I think of wet and wild
and it is their mega lass lipsticks
these are only a couple dollars the one
I'm wearing right now is one that if
you've been watching my channel you know
that I love which is 903 C in the shade
just peachy and it's just this really
nice coral peach shade the last time I
showed in the video people were saying
it looks a little different than theirs
so I don't know if the shade differs or
if they've if this is the newer version
or maybe there's no I don't know but
this is the version I found very
recently in the store within the last
couple months I'm wearing it today now
this formula is one that I've kind of
grown to love because when I was first
trying these years ago they are more of
a dry formula but once you kind of heat
it up either you heat it up on the back
of your hand or you just keep going on
your lips it warms up and then it's
really it'll spread easier but upon
first usage you'll see what I mean it
does kind of tug and they are a cheaper
lipstick however amongst the cheap
lipsticks of the world these are one of
the better ones because some of them are
really dry at first but they never
really warm up whereas these do the
other shade I wanted to mention is in
916 D and the shade is called Raven
raisin and
is this gorgeous deep purple and it
looks kind of like whoa at first but in
the fall if you wear like a lighter lip
gloss on top of it it kind of just makes
it look like this really deep nice
mellow color but it can look really deep
but if you're into that and you know it
look good on you then you'd love it but
if you're kind of like me where you're
like I don't know then I would say try
it out with a lip gloss on top of it
because that kind of sheers it out just
a little bit and makes it look a little
more wearable but I do love it and this
one is so creamy just even upon first
putting it on this one was creamy so
those are two of my favorite shades I
had to mention now one of the duds I
wanted to mention I tried out on my eyes
today this one is a wet and wild color
icon glitter single in brass and it's
this golden glitter gel and when I first
tried it I loved it because the top
layer of this when I would swirl my
finger into it and it is like a gel
there was a ton of glitter I put it on
and it was really kind of like a thick
layer of glitter I was like wow but once
you get past that first layer it's just
okay they're so glitter there and what I
did today
is on my lid I just took the little bit
of glitter and I just kind of patted it
patted it in like an area and so you can
see there's still that little bit of
glitter there so I would let it dry for
a second and Pat on a little more and it
would add a little more but it doesn't
stay put as well as I had hoped it would
so like I feel like I was able to get a
lot of glitter on this lid but not as
much on this lid so I had to top it was
so sticky and it never really dried so I
topped it with an eye shadow they sell
I'll show you in a second and it helped
but again it just it's uneven and patchy
so this is one that the first layer was
great so if you know you're just going
to maybe use it once you'll love it for
that one time and it's cheap it's like
in dollar ninety-nine but anything
beyond that it's not great it's just not
great so what I'm wearing on my eyes
completely and alone is this wet wild
palette it is their comfort zone palette
these are around five dollars and it
comes with eight shades they've got a
purple one and a blue one as well but
this is the one that to me seemed the
most wearable I my favorite shades and
then
this yellowish brow bone color they call
it a brow bone I am wearing on my brow
and I also put as my lid shade then I
used
oh my gosh my favorite this like kind of
patina all of the green color it makes
me think of Mac's patina in a way I love
this shade I'll swatch this one must
watch a few of my favorites and this
like amber kind of color here these are
two of my absolute favorite shades and
when you swatch them you'll see oh gosh
even just seeing them I'm like wow it's
just the most beautiful so pigmented so
shimmery and oh my gosh I mean it makes
me think of my Too Faced shadows that I
love like from my chocolate bar palette
they are so gorgeous I would say this
palette is worth buying for these two
shades alone but then they've got these
deeper colors like this deep green eye
where I'm wearing today are all along my
lower lash line and also kind of on the
outer corner of my eye and then there's
this really interesting kind of
duochrome one that i'll do it on the
back of my hand um yeah so this is the
duochrome one I was talking about and
then this is that green one that I like
to wear on my lower lash line these are
beautiful now this doesn't come with any
matte shades so if you know you don't
like shimmer on your eyes probably would
like this palette but if you want to mix
this or use this in conjunction with
maybe at least one matte shadow maybe
for the crease but I ended up using this
in the crease as well as this so I just
kind of did both and then like I said
the dark green just lining my eye all
around and on the outer corner it's
beautiful and then this is such a
beautiful kind of light it reminds me of
rice paper from Mac it's just a light
kind of creamy yellow beige I love it so
another kind of Doug I wanted to mention
it's not terrible but this is the wet
and wild coverall primer now I had tried
their foundation I really like it I've
it got old and so I got rid of it but
it's a really nice foundation so that's
what I would recommend they're really
cheap the color range is
not great because it is a really cheap
brand so that was one of the huge
downsize if you're lucky enough to find
your foundation color in it it really is
a nice it's got high coverage and it's
just a nice foundation but the primer
that goes along with it I've done a demo
with the foundation primer I can link
below if you are interested it's it
smells like Elmer's glue and I think
that's what turns me off so every time
I'm looking at my primer area of my
drawer and I'm thinking about which
Wonderware
I never reach for this one because of
the smell alone does it hold on to your
foundation okay yeah I think it my I
just can't and it's the consistency of
Elmer's glue I I think it helps the
foundation stay on longer any foundation
but I don't think it's going to make or
break you I think there are better
drugstore primers out there like the
maybelline baby skin is pretty good you
know I would go for that one or the
Rimmel base perfect one over this one
it's okay but it's not the best that's
out there um the this one I I know I'm
sounding redundant about this
highlighter I've talked about literally
in the last three videos but this is the
wet and wild color icon bronzer in
reserve your Cabana I won't talk about
it too much just know that this is one
of my favorite highlighters I'm wearing
it today you can see it's just this
light colored powder that just has a
little bit of shimmer to it and that
little bit of shimmer really just
catches the light so beautifully and it
just makes you look like you're glowing
without look looking like you're trying
too hard you know it's not like a really
shimmery one or glittery it's just got a
nice glow it's beautiful it's 399 you
cannot beat this and there's so much
product in here this is one that I have
repurchased a couple times because I've
used it up or yeah so the next the last
two I'm going to mention the first one
is a blush this is what I don't hear
many people talking about
so one wild by Fergie blush and it's
from the centerstage collection and it's
called brush with destiny and it's this
gorgeous peachy shimmery but it's got a
little bit of pink but I would say it's
more peachy than anything it's really
really pigmented really creamy it blends
well
now it does have a shimmer to it so if
you don't like that you wouldn't like
this it kind of reminds me of NARS
orgasm blush but it's a little more
wearable sometimes I think the NARS one
can look almost too much in the daylight
like way too much but this one is really
really nice I'm wearing this one today
as well
looks a little harsh over here though
but I really I love this color I think
it could look really nice and frosty if
you've got a deeper skin tone but if you
have a lighter one it just looks really
glowy um really pretty summertime like
cabana look you know but without being
too much I love it the last thing I'm
going to mention is one that is hard to
find for some people I found mine app
Walmart I think but this is the wedding
wah when wild color icon contouring
palette they have two different shades
this one's in caramel toffee the other
one I think is called dulce de leche and
this one I love it does the contour
shade has a little bit of almost a rose
tint to it
but not too much where it's obvious it's
it's a really nice contour shade and I
wore it today I even did a little bit up
here it's just so easy to work with
because it's not too pigmented it's
still pigmented enough that it shows up
but it's not one that you can screw up
too easily which I really really like
and then the highlighting shade I
actually use to set my under eye
concealer it's just it's not again it's
not the most pigmented thing in the
world and it doesn't really show and
swatches but because it's completely
matte it's really nice at lightening
this area and like if you've got a
really dewy or tacky concealer it does a
great job of setting that as well I used
this today going down my nose as well
and up here just to lighten it without
adding any shimmer it's perfect for that
but again I would say out of the - I
like the contour shade the best and it's
really hard to find contouring products
in the drugstore there's a lot more
coming out now but for a while it was
hard to find so when this recently came
out you know I think it was it was sold
out pretty much everywhere I looked
because it's I mean it's so great that
they have something like this out there
so those are all of my wet and wild
recommendations and some that maybe I
wouldn't recommend there are so many
other products from wet wild that are
great as well but I I kind of corralled
my favorites and then if
that I wanted you guys to maybe a boy
let me know what your wet wild favorites
are down below I would love to see it
I'm sure everyone else that's watching
this
might be curious about some other ones
out there I'd also be curious to know
what your other favorite shades that the
megalast lipsticks are so list those
below as well because I'm wanting to try
a few more I can link my gems of the
drugstore playlist below I used to do
these a long time ago I haven't done
them in a while but I'm kind of
resurrecting this as well so I can link
those older ones below if you're
interested to see but I'll be coming out
with a lot more new ones for the
different brands other than that I hope
you'll subscribe and I'll catch you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
