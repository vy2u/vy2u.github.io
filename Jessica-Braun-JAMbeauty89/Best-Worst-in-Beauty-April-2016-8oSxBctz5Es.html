gonna share with you guys a little bit
late my April favorites and I also have
a few products that kind of disappointed
me so let's go ahead and get into it
first of all it is May that means I only
have a little bit longer until the
school years over and that is really
exciting so I'm looking forward to that
and I feel like I know I've heard from a
lot of you guys like gosh I feel like
you don't upload very much or you know
it's been kind of sporadic and it has
been sporadic I feel like my life right
now is really chaotic at school because
it is the end of the year I mean if
you're not in school or you I mean you
all know how it is you were in school at
some point the end of the year it's just
a little bit chaotic and really busy so
it's kind of winding down and I'm so
excited for the summer so that I can
really get a lot of awesome videos
posted for you guys we let's get into my
favorites so the first one was a
surprise one and I have a lot of
drugstore this is one of the few like
higher and ones I'm gonna mention the
rest are pretty much drugstore this is
from Chu pur cosmetics and they send me
a lot of their PR products and I
hesitate to show a lot of those to you
guys unless I just love them because I
don't want you to feel like I'm ever
pushing products just because they were
sent to me because when a product is
sent to me or to any youtuber unless
it's a specifically sponsored video we
don't have to show it ever we don't have
to do anything with it because it's not
a contract so this one really impressed
me this one hat is called their gradient
matte shimmer bronzer and it's called
glow together and it's this huge pan and
in it it has it's a gradient this top
the top three little pillows are matte
in the bottom three are shimmer and it's
just this perfectly light bronzer if
you've got a skin tone anywhere in your
mind if you're deeper this probably
wouldn't do much for you it might even
be a highlighter for you but also I'm
gonna swatch the matte and the shimmer
for you guys so there's the matte one
and there's the shimmer they're just so
pillow-soft they really are and they
just stay on all day I actually kind of
bronzed up my face today with the matte
portion that's the portion I'm using the
most but I was so impressed with a how
well it blends in and also how long it
stays on and it's also just the
packaging is so pretty as well and the
way it's put together so it's like a win
win win
and it's tons of product I mean there's
a lot going for this just but I know
it's really expensive all right so some
drugstore stuff this I actually
mentioned in my empties video if it's up
I'll link it below if it's not just sit
tight scumming this BB cream from the
drugstore I really like it's the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin glow sheers
illuminating tinted moisturizer I might
have already mentioned this in a
favorites video now that I'm saying it
but I don't mind because it's so good
I'm gonna mention it again
it's an illuminating tinted moisturizer
so it's like a BB cream in that really
it's a moisturizer that has a little
color it has SPF of 30 it's an
antioxidant blend it's oil-free and it
just does a great job of not making my
skin look crazy slick or really weird
and it's also really great paired with
other things so if you wanted to take a
foundation that's really matte and mix
it with this it kind of just adds a
lightweight feel to it without
completely making it oily or a
completely different colored consistency
it's really good at mixing as well so
I've used this in so many ways I just
really really like it I'm wearing this
shade fair to light 20 so it's not I
think there's definitely one maybe two
that are lighter than this but it really
is nice and it's a perfect thing to
throw in like your beach bag or your
pool bag because it does have that SPF
in it you might want a little higher but
it's great because it makes your skin
look a little bit more flawless but it
really it doesn't I don't want you to
get twisted it doesn't have a ton of
coverage but it does here I'll kind of
show you on my hand here it does add
just enough in my opinion now if you've
got some severe problems you see if you
can't even see it here it's just so
pretty just a little bit it does have
this smell I don't love kind of a
sunscreen type smell so if that would
bother you you might want to stay away
because it is a pretty strong smell and
you get used to it once it's on your
face but it takes about a minute to get
used to because it is a really strong
smell but it's just so pretty it is
illuminating if you already have really
oily skin I don't think you'll like this
the next favorite is from wet and wild
and this is the wet and wild color icon
ombre blush in the princess daiquiri
I can't stop talking about this one
either you guys it is just I'm wearing
it today it's just so pretty
I love this because you can't screw it
up if you get a ton on your brush and
put it on it never looks like clown face
and I know some people that's like a
turn-off they're like I want something
that's really pigmented and I just need
a little bit but for me I'm like
honestly I'm not a makeup artist I'm not
that good at makeup so I feel like I
need to like be able to pile a ton on my
brush and then put it on and then I
can't really screw it up I love that
about this and it has that really pretty
glow portion to it cuz the ombre the
light part really does have a nice
shimmer to it and so it just ends up
looking so pretty I know if you're a
really if you're a way deeper than me
it's not gonna show up the same way
obviously that it shows up on me but I
was just impressed with this whole line
of blushes they stay on they stay in
place and I was impressed I love I have
a whole review and swatch video of that
entire line if you're interested I can
link it below alright next one this is
actually a drugstore dud this is the
boots number 7 lash and brow
Perfector now I don't hate this but I
don't love it and here's what I'll say
it's just a clear brow gel it's kind of
looking gross and brown so I don't think
I'm gonna show a close-up because
honestly it grosses me out when people
show close-ups if they're like weird
brow gel but the brush is really really
tiny it comes to a point I love that I
wish every brow gel came at the brush
exactly like this because you can really
get in there and brush through your
brows and even go back through and kind
of push the hairs down that maybe are
sticking up where they shouldn't but it
just doesn't really hold for a while I
didn't mind it and I think I've
mentioned this before kind of in a
pleasant light because the brush is so
good but now that I've used it some more
I've just realized that by the end of
the day my brow hairs are just kind of
wonky and everywhere and I'm like why is
that and then finally I realized oh it's
this it's not holding it where it needs
to and that is the entire purpose for a
brow gel
so as I've used it more and more I've
kind of changed my tune on it so take
that for what it is part of me wants to
clean off the brush and just dip it in
like all my other brow gels that I like
but so another drugstore favorite this
is from wet &amp;amp; wild it's their color icon
single and brulee this used to be a cult
classic on YouTube like every
was talking about it for like ever
because it's like a penny if they're so
cheap and they're just a matte light
light cream powder and so if you've got
a skin tone like mine this is the
perfect like neutral color it's like a
base for your eye look I actually use
this almost singularly for right under
my brow bone because look how pigmented
it is on my light skin you can even see
this swatch that's how like pure matte
nude this is so I love that it is so
perfect
it's just so good all the wet wild
shadows are good but this is like a
standout knockout like it's always sold
out there's a lot of else it's always
sold out when I see it in stores I
actually got this at the dollar tree if
you haven't seen my Dollar Tree haul did
I mention this in that Hall did I forget
I don't know but if you haven't seen my
Dollar Tree haul of makeup that they're
selling there they've got like
physicians floor mail and like all kinds
of name brands there I'll link that
below as well cuz that was really fun
shopping their next favorite is kind of
a random brand I've never heard of this
is Scone cosmetics SK ome and it's their
insanely intense tattooed waterproof
eyeliner this came in one of the
subscription boxes I unbox on my channel
and it's a felt tip liner it's super
black and it is definitely waterproof
this I'm actually I kind of struggle to
remove at the end of the day but I'm
kind of like yes that's exactly what I
want I want an eyeliner that does not
budge especially like today I did a
little bit of a wing doesn't move all
day I could cry wouldn't matter doesn't
move I love this stuff it's like
seriously rivaling if not better then my
Stila stay all day waterproof liner that
I'm obsessed with a lot of you guys are
telling me to try out the Kat Von D
tattoo liner which I have not tried so
that's kind of on my like bucket list of
makeup I need to try maybe within the
year because I've heard it is also
amazing and I'm like that is like if I
have like one to two makeup items only
liquid liner is one of them like a
felt-tip really good black waterproof
one so I was so impressed I've been
using this exclusively for the past few
weeks I love it so much I better get it
off before it arty dried watch like I
literally am
that is incredible I'm not sure exactly
where it's sold so I'll definitely find
it
line to link it because I don't think
that's a brand that's necessarily sold
in a lot of stores another favorite this
is the boots number seven lipstick and
if they're moisture drench lipstick and
romantic I know I've mentioned this
before as well because I love it
it looks like what I'm wearing today but
I'm actually today wearing one of the
Katie Katie Katie cat matte lipsticks I
kind of mixed Sphinx with kitty purry
these two I'm doing this swatch video
this next so also look for that this is
just such a beautiful moisturizing
beautiful color lipstick it's just
comfortable and I feel like everyone's
so focused on Matt right now and
sometimes it's so drying and you know
I've kind of just been leaning towards
this Rago lipsticks that are just
comfortable they have a little bit of
that not shimmer but just like
moisturizing quality to it I kind of
love this so I'm going back to that away
from all the matte of course I'm about
to do that video but still I just really
like tab is very impressed so if you
have a target near you that sells boots
number seven definitely try it up
but speaking of boots number seven I
have another dud this is the stay
perfect long-lasting volume mascara from
them and I was like oh my gosh this
packaging is so cute I bought a ton of
boots products to try out and I'm still
trying to last few out to be able to do
my video on it because I wanted to have
a really thorough feel of all the
products I'm gonna show in the video and
the brush looked kind of promising it's
kind of got the silicone type plasticky
fiber bristles snow you guys it
literally did absolutely nothing like it
was one of those mascaras that you put
it on your like didn't even go on so you
dip it back in and then it dries weird
and your lashes all stick together so
you have like four lashes and they're
not even that black and they're not
curled and you're like what just
happened I had to start over when I use
this so then on another day a day that I
wasn't like trying to get ready for work
I tried it again it was on a weekend and
it did the same thing a couple weeks
later and I thought maybe I gave it some
time to maybe dry out just a little bit
get some air in it no this stuff is so
bad you guys now if you've tried this
and you figured out a way to make it
work let me know because I haven't had
it that long
and if it's a matter of maybe it needs
more time to dry out or maybe there's a
secret let me know because I'm like dang
it but alright the last two are kind of
more high-end favorite so this one is
from Mac and as their Pro Longwear
concealer this is a this is an industry
favorite for a reason it has the best
coverage but the lightest weight I feel
like so many concealers that I love like
there's the tarte maracuja creaseless
concealer I love that stuff but it is
very thick and it's very tacky like
literally sticky tacky whereas the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer it has honestly
maybe even better coverage but it's not
tacky at all and it's really thin it's
really lightweight now I will say this
crease is a little bit so like today I
used it and I kind of did that classic
triangle here out of my eye and after I
actually use a brush to kind of blend it
in and after I let it sit I'll see that
they're like where my fine lines are
there's a little bit of creasing so
usually I'll just take this finger my
ring finger and just push it in and then
it's gone and there's no more creasing
so I think it might have like one
instance of creasing and then usually
it's okay now a lot of times I'll still
set it with some kind of powder just to
make sure it stays in place but this
stuff is amazing you can use it for
concealer you could use it like if you
wanted to do kind of like highlighting
on your face you you get a lighter color
of this for your skin tone and use it
that way I mean it is incredible it
stays in place all day it's just perfect
it is absolutely perfect if you have
like a wedding coming up a prom some
sort of special event it doesn't have
SPF so it won't do a weird flashback
thing I love this stuff alright last
thing I'm gonna mention and this was the
most shocking to me of all I thought I
would absolutely hate it I'm gonna be
very very candid this is the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette I was
ok I'm of the school of thought that
like I really used to like cool toned
eyeshadows I like neutrals duh I usually
use kind of lighter colors just in
general you guys know that about me so
when I saw this with like the weird in
my opinion obviously it's like the weird
blue shade in there and
like it had some pretty colors but I
just thought it was a weird combo
well two-face sent this to me with some
other stuff a while ago and I got it and
I'm like you know I do like the original
Too Faced chocolate bar palette I love
the smell but you know I've never really
had my eyes set on this I didn't buy it
ever for a reason I just didn't think
I'd like it I might like this more than
the chocolate bar palette I started
really looking at it and I was trying to
look at each shadow individually and
think okay like how can I wear this how
do I want to wear this now the blue I
haven't really tackled these others like
glittery shades I haven't really tackled
either but these shades are gorgeous
these right here this whole bottom row
which I'm holding it upside down but
this row right here is so gorgeous
they're all I mean this butter pecan the
big shade I'm wearing on my lids today
it's just this gorgeous kind of
yellowish color which is a nice change
from like the like kind of not silvery
but kind of like champagne color I
usually wear that's like a little more
ivory than this bonbon is a new favorite
it's the one I'm actually wearing almost
all over the place it's like this kind
of amber rose gold type color rum-raisin
is so pretty it's like a kind of a
pewter Brown they have like mousse which
is like a perfect medium brown they have
puddin which is like a cooler tone Brown
but then they have a warmer tone one up
here which is truffled so they have
covered everything in this palette and I
love that about it about it I think what
really threw me off is the fact that I
had the blue it there and it just like
the colors didn't go well together and
it bothered my like like visually it
bothered me so I love it now and I can't
believe that I love it but I do and of
course to face shadows it's actually one
of my favorite favorite favorite brands
of shadows because they're so creamy
they blend so beautifully and they don't
budge so hopefully this video was
enjoyable for you those are all of my
favorites and kind of unfavorite for
this month and I hope that you'll catch
my other videos on my channel and
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
