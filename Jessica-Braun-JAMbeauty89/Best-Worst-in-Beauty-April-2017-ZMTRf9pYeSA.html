my April favorites and flops I've got
quite a few flops this time I feel like
a little bit more than normal but I love
sharing what I'm not liking with you
guys because I think it's helpful to
know what maybe you should avoid in
addition to what maybe you should look
out for something that you think you
might like I hope that you will
subscribe before you leave and let's go
ahead and get into it so the first
favorite is from quip it is a toothbrush
and they're actually sponsoring this
video I love this toothbrush I never
accept sponsorships from companies that
I don't believe in or that I actually
use and genuinely love I have used an
electric toothbrush for a long time but
the one I've always used is really big
and bulky and it has the charger and so
since we travel like once a month it was
kind of stressful so that I would just
end up bringing a regular toothbrush but
I never felt like it was as good of a
clean as an electric toothbrush but the
other one was just so bulky this is as
small as a regular toothbrush and yet
it's electric so you turn it on it of
course vibrates and I feel like my teeth
are so much more clean every 30 seconds
it gives you like a little pulse to let
you know to like switch to a different
area of your mouth that way you're
actually brushing your teeth for two
minutes you are supposed to do that and
a big reason why I really liked the
company I wanted to do this was because
one of their biggest aims is to
enlighten people on proper oral tooth
and gum tear and a lot of people just
don't know a lot of people don't brush
their teeth twice a day a lot of people
don't know you should brush your tongue
or how much toothpaste you really use so
I thought that was really cool and the
other reason I thought this is awesome
and my husband's excited about this as
well is that every three months you can
choose to have a refill sent to you and
all the refill is is this top portion
because they have a bunch of different
colors I love this like rose gold type
color but they'll send you the new head
so you just pop it off and you would put
the refill head back on this and the
battery the reason it doesn't need a
charger is it's just a triple-a battery
so you would just refill that every so
often I love the little holder this
construction to your mirror if you want
if you wanted to take this off and
suction it to your mirror you could if
you wanted it just as a stand however
you wanted to use it and you can flip it
around and it's like a little travel
case I love that so with their refill
like subscription service
she's bought the toothbrush you can find
out for like a year of refills and pay
all of that at once you could do no
refills or you could buy them whenever
you want them so there's a lot of
different option I chose the metal one
but they also have plastic ones too if
they're a little bit cheaper but also
toothpaste like a three-months fill of
just anti cavity mint toothpaste which i
thought was awesome and they have two
weak little travel-size ones so long
story short I think this is a great
company actually have a promo code if
you're interested in trying clip for the
first time I will put it on the screen
now as well as down below in the
description box if you'd like to save a
little bit of money this toothbrush is
amazing
I'm getting my husband one I think he
picked out like the darker like black
one because he thinks it's awesome as
well and he was kind of envious alright
let's talk about a flop a product I did
not like that would be these pure
cosmetic sponges now I know that
kathleenlights loves these I think
they've reformulated these bad boys and
a lot of people have said that as well
because these are very dense you feel
like you're punching yourself in the
face even when you wet it you know it
gets a little bit bigger but it's still
really really dense and when I was
trying this versus a Beauty Blender or
the Real Techniques sponge it just felt
like I was being myself up and I hated
it so I'm sad because I think like this
mint one is so pretty why does it have a
Beauty Blender come out with a mint one
I want one but I just didn't like them
it's not to say that you can't apply
makeup with them like I obviously did
use it it wasn't a comfortable
experience and knowing what I know about
other ones and how much better they are
it is hard for me to use this now if
this is the only Beauty sponge you've
ever tried I don't think it's like the
worst thing in the world
but I really don't think it's great and
the real technique ones technically are
cheaper because I think this 3-pack was
like $36 so that's still $12 a pop I
think you can get a 2 pack of real
techniques for cheaper than that alright
so let's talk about a couple favorites
before I go on with those flops one of
my new favorite foundations is from
number 7 it's their state perfect
foundation I haven't found my correct
shade I've already bought two of these
I'm like I'm not buying a third one so
I've been mixing these this is in calico
and then this one's in warm ivory warm
Ivory's a little bit too dark
for me calicos a little bit to money I
need to get the color in between but the
coverage on this is absolutely medium to
full it is buildable it is beautiful
it's funny because when I heard stay
perfect I worried that it would be like
very mattifying I don't think it's
mattify I think it's kind of got this
nice satin finish to it it's not super
matte which I like I don't like a matte
finish on my face but I do like a satin
finish so it's got good coverage on the
bottle it says medium coverage I think
you can absolutely build it up it is one
of my favorites it wears really nicely
throughout the day I've been applying it
with a Beauty Blender that's my favorite
way I tried it with some brushes and
it's okay but I do think it's best with
a sponge but I found - Target I know you
can also get it online I love it so much
I think I will eventually just buy the
darn color in between and now I'm not
having to mix and match and I know that
like one of my sisters is a little bit
fairs and I she would love this so I
might have calico on to her alright next
favorite is from Milani it's there keep
it sweet lip scrub this stuff smells
with a vanilla dream it really does if
you like vanilla you would lose it when
you smell I mean it's like my favorite
vanilla scent but it's this scrub that
you can kind of dig into it's totally
suspended in a balm which is why I think
it's so amazing because it's almost
moisturizing while you're scrubbing and
I literally would just get a little bit
on my finger it might not be most
sanitary business mindless and I'll just
struck to a strip strip scrub and then
I'll just wipe it off with a warm
washcloth oh my gosh it is like it's
almost like a spa for your lips and this
is only I mean it's under $10 I want to
say it's like $5.99 or $7.99 this stuff
is amazing the lip balm that they sell
in this keep it sweet line is really
good as well but I think the scrub
stands out even more because there are
not a lot of lip scrubs in the drugstore
let alone this is the best lip scrub I
have ever tried it is amazing if I ran
out I would absolutely repurchase it but
I have a feeling it'll be a while before
I do run out of it but it's amazing all
right moving along my favorite trustor
eyeshadow if you watch me on snapchat I
each morning Monday through Friday when
I'm getting ready for work
I usually will show the product I'm
using and show me applying them
sometimes your swatches my thoughts on
them and I feel like I'm using this all
the time this is the Maybelline expert
wear eye shadow and it's a nude glow I
actually like to apply it with the
little sponge applicator because it
really packs this on this looks like a
pressed version of like the matte tan
pigment or maybe even like l'oréal's
amber rush which is pretty much the
exact same thing it is so gorgeous and
just kind of shimmery and it's one of
those shadows that you could only use
this shadow and it will look like you
tried really hard even though you
haven't like throw this shadow on your
lid blend it into the crease put a
little eyeliner mascara on and it looks
like you really tried and that's all you
use it is amazing it is so rare I think
nowadays to find like a shadow a single
shadow that you're like oh my gosh that
this is one that really stands out now
do I think it's on par with like Urban
Decay like one swipe one swipe and
you're done I think you need to get
maybe more than one swipe but I'm fine
with that one it's such a pretty color
and it's so much cheaper next favorite
is from L'Oreal and this is their
infallible paint for your lips and they
sent me I think the whole line this one
and spicy blush is so perfect it is so
perfect it's got a sponge tip applicator
and this is like that perfect rosy mauve
that you see everyone wearing but this
one is comfortable it doesn't dry your
lips out it looks amazing it's pigmented
like it has everything going for it and
since I know a lot of us are kind of
moving away from the matte lip trend and
going to more go out there and a lot of
people like metallic I don't like that
on me necessarily I might change my mind
I don't know but I do like a nice glossy
juicy lip and this one is kind of just
bridging that gap and I think it is so
beautiful I love it and this color spicy
blush is gorgeous
so my next product that I loved are
these elf lip tint oil tinted lip oils
whatever they're called of course I'll
have everything listed in links below
but these are so amazing probably one of
my favorite elf lip products
ever come out with because again they're
comfortable and if you're a real human
like me and you have a job and you want
to wear lip products but you also know
yourself and you know you're not going
to want to reapply it you don't want to
worry about it thread through the day
and how it's wearing off how it's
looking this is the answer because they
feel good on your lips but the colors
are pretty they're not really like punch
you in the face colors but like this one
here and pink kiss is just as gorgeous
kind of blue toned pink and I think it's
so pretty it's so comfortable on the
lips and I find myself reaching for this
all the time I have a couple in my purse
another one I have right in front of me
is in red kiss I don't really wear this
one is often but it is a lot sheer then
you would think these are probably going
to be my go-to summer
lip colors if you will because they are
comfortable and they just look juicy
like you ate a popsicle but a little bit
cleaner than that and I just really like
them let's talk about an unfavored a
slop this is the pur cosmetics not PU
are but pure2 entrained pur cosmetics
buff collection palette now I got this
and I'm sure a boxycharm a couple months
ago I was all excited because I don't
have the Naked 3 but it looks almost
only similar to the Naked 3 let me put a
picture of the Naked 3 right here so
looking at these two I mean obviously
they're incredibly similar but I'm not
excited so much well I don't have the
Naked 3 this will be great to kind of
fill that gap not really a gap please
but that gap in my collection
um so i swatched them on my go wow
they're actually pretty good well I put
them on my eyelid I use Mohave and that
didn't work very well then I used
moonstone of sandstone and then I tried
Canyon and then desert I kept trying
different colors on my lips and they
would literally I'd put it on and then I
would start to blend it with other
things and it'd be gone like just
completely blended away I've never used
a shadow that just left like it just
left the building off of my eyelid it
was the weirdest thing like I feel like
I've used tons of drugstore ones and
they don't do that even drugstore ones
that I don't like do that like they
don't disappear I'm saying crazy anyways
but this is horrible and it's washed
pretty decently let me show you so
let's see here's Mojave they actually
swatch beautifully but they are
powdering I don't know how to explain it
it was the craziest thing I think you
could make it work it's this like this
but you have but kids the thing is if
this were like five or ten dollars I
don't think I'd be as upset I don't know
maybe I would be but I think this was
like retail that like 40 or 50 dollars
months what if you were ever divided at
the full price just by the Urban Decay
ones but I don't know I just thought no
no all right next favorite is eyeshadow
palette it is this hard candy power and
it's called their look Pro matte
eyeshadow Pro palette and it has these
unbelievable shapes that are just
perfectly neutral but it's really got a
range and they are surprisingly
beautiful blended together they blend
really well they're nice and pigmented
every time I've done a look with this
all of you guys especially like on
snapchat will say what are you wearing
under eyes and it's always this and so
like if you've been eyeing like the Kat
Von D shade in my eye palette I love
that if actually what I'm wearing today
everywhere except for my lid I think I
pulled a color from Modern Renaissance
but if you've been eyeing that palette
for the colors I do think that one is of
course a little bit of a step above its
lines even better but I was incredibly
surprised at how well this blended just
beautiful a great range of colors you
can totally get a complete look out of
this I just loved it
alright it's a couple more favorites and
one more flop another favorite of mine
is this Laura Mercier matte radiance
baked powder in highlight oh one I've
talked about this before I love it so
much I actually put it on today that I
wanted to amp up my highlight a little
bit more so I added that pixie and Aspen
elbahr Aspen barred glowy powder in
London luster because I just love this
powder
I almost included in my favorite I mean
I'm mentioning it now
it is amazing it could totally but I
feel like I talked about all time so I
have this on and I put that on even more
on top but this is just exactly as it
sounds a matte radiant so it does have
radiance to it for sure but it has this
satin light quality to it that makes it
look so beautiful lit-from-within so if
you don't like that start kind of a glow
but you do like a glowy look like a
candle lit look this is the answer I'm
never going to ride it the dome product
there's tons in there it's so creamy
it's a very thin layer but I think
because of that it stays on even longer
and it just melds into your skin even
more it doesn't look like you just put a
bunch of powder right there it just
feels it looks like it's a part of your
skin ah I don't love it so much and
every time I pull it out in like oh my
gosh why am I not using this every
single day so my next favorite is this
Gillette Venus shower and shave cream no
it's not sponsored by them I know it
says with this stuff I bought it on a
whim because I was running low on my
vino like kind of foamy shave gel that I
like I think it's great for sensitive
skin but I was just like I don't know I
want something new I've been using that
like the past couple of times I bought
one so I saw this and I was like on it
and it is going to last me forever it's
like a body wash if you will it is not a
foam it really is like almost like a
body wash consistency smells so good
this is in freesia but it will kind of
it it's the most moisturizing thing when
you're shaving your legs like more
moisture than anything I've ever used
and actually stays in place definitely
well I mean like I said it's not going
to create like a thick layer to to
actually shave but it just moisturize
everything and kind of suds up a little
bit and it's the best shave I've ever
gotten on my life it is amazing amazing
amazing if you see in the store buy I
don't know I'm assuming there may be
other senses the only one I've tried but
I've only used it like a couple times
and I'm already addicted I'm like I've
got to tell you guys about it it's
amazing
last product that really disappointed me
is from pixie it's their cat eye ink
it's this kind of a sponge tip
applicator if you will
it's like felt but it's like hard I
don't know how to describe it and it
kind of this chisel look to it
and it just is not black no matter what
I do it's like this gray almost
see-through tight black and it's just
really disappointing it doesn't cover
shimmery shadow the way I would want it
to and for that reason I'm just like hmm
you know I feel like I can find way
better for even cheaper than pixie is
and I don't know I just pass I've used
it maybe three or four times and every
time I thought it looked terrible and so
I'm just like I don't think I need to
try this out anymore I just don't like
it so that was a total dud so those were
all of my favorites and swaps for April
I hope that you enjoyed if you're
