gonna share with you guys my August
favorites we're getting into fall and
I'm so excited I'm pretty sure my
husband and I are planning on decorating
for fall on like within a couple days
today the day I'm filming is Labor Day
and we've already talked about getting
the stuff out of the art garage and like
decorating so enough about fall and how
excited I am I'm sure a lot of you guys
are excited too let's talk about my
favorites I have a lot and I also have
one product that I just didn't love that
I'll mention as well so one of the ones
that surprised me that I loved was this
l'oreal infallible pro glow this was one
that i I don't know I had gone back and
forth with on whether or not I would
keep it I did a declutter of my
foundations and this was this is a shade
I was going to get rid of 205 natural
beige but now that I have worn it some
more it actually kind of matches the
rest of my skin even though my facial
skin which is way paler than the rest of
my body it actually does kind of work
especially right now in the summer when
I have a little bit more color of course
with these lights I look super pale also
I'm just always semi pale but regardless
this is working for me right now
but what I want to talk about is not the
shade it's the formula it's a really
liquidy formula it kind of surprised me
listen you can hear it shaking up it's
very liquidy and when you pour it out
and I'll show you pour you know what I
mean squeeze it out it's very it's just
very liquidy it almost would run down
yeah it's kind of running down my hand
there but there's something about it
that with my skin type which is normal
to dry it just looks so flawless on the
skin I will say it does have obviously a
dewy glowy effect but for me I would
rather have that and then have to kind
of tame it down a little bit that have
to keep adding more and more glow I
really like that and so I've worn it in
the heat outside we were doing like this
outdoor thing with my school and I wore
it and it just looks so lovely even in
the heat I just thought it looks so nice
and it made my skin looks so healthy now
if you have really oily skin you would
hate this you need to see you're far far
away but for me I didn't like the
regular infallible it was too dry so if
you had tried the regular infallible and
you felt like
this is too dry for my skin it's not
quite what I need then you probably
really like this so I just really liked
I was so surprised I can't stop using it
honestly and I feel like it's been a
while since I've tried a foundation that
I just can't stop using so I was really
excited about this one there's a lot of
like true blue favorites that I'm
looking at right now I want to buy more
shades of this and I'm probably going to
I'm kind of getting that yearning and it
happens every time the seasons change
where I want to go to the drugstore buy
more makeup do I need to know do I want
to to review some more stuff of course
but also selfishly I just want more of
like these this is the maybelline color
blur I don't know why more people aren't
talking about these I still don't know
why this is in the shade I'm blushing
and it's I love this shade but it's not
really the shade that makes me crazy for
it it's just this formula it's a really
thin but dry formula but it's
moisturizing it's dry in that it doesn't
get all over the place but it's
moisturizing in that it's so creamy but
it just melts into your lips and it just
feels like you're not wearing anything
you're wearing like maybe a little bit
of chapstick but it looks full-on like a
matte lipstick but it's comfortable
that's what I'm saying I don't know why
people aren't talking about this all
over the place so I want to go and get
some of them other more wearable shades
I had a like a berry one I think I don't
know if I get rid of it or not in my
declutter you'll find out soon it'll be
up soon but um oh my gosh I just love
the formulas so much so it does have
this like wax the I used it once or
twice
we're not waxy but like rubbery type
thing you can use to kind of blur it out
I don't really ever use it I don't
really have have a need for it I just
love this so much if you haven't tried
one of these and you're so tired of
everything else out there you need to
try one of these it blew my mind
next thing is a mascara this is the
covergirl super sizer now if you're like
me and you feel like everyone on YouTube
is talking about this and it's kind of
annoying you're like it's just another
drugstore mascara how good can it be
because for me I feel like every time
there's a new mascara suddenly it's
every youtubers favorite mascara and I
don't understand that because I end up
trying all of them in the end not all
but many of them and some of them you
never hear
talk about because I'm just like it was
just kind of meant what's it terrible
where I felt like I needed to let you
know don't buy this it's horrible but it
wasn't like life-changing and so for me
I just get annoyed and that's just me
but I just get annoyed when every single
person is talking about the same mascara
because it's brand new and I'm just like
but this one is unbelievable it is
probably the best I'm trying to think
through some of my drugstore favorites
this is I think I really think it might
be the best drugstore mascara I've ever
ever ever ever tried I need to buy a new
one because this one's starting to get
old but it's just the covergirl super
sizer the brush is really weird and I
thought I would hate it it's like
basically they're little prongs sticking
out like two of the sides and then the
other side it's like there's nothing but
the way I use it I don't really know how
they intend for it to be used but what I
do is I use the pronged ends first and I
just wiggle it right at the base so it
almost tight lines my eye and it really
gives a lot of volume and it pushes your
lashes up then I'll let that dry for a
second and I'll use the ends where
there's like nothing on it it's
basically just mascara and like a stick
there's no like prongs and I'll use that
to add a bunch of volume because all
it's doing is adding on more of the
product then I'll go back to the prom
den and kind of brush through it to make
sure that it's not like weird or clumpy
or anything it's the only mascara I feel
like that like holds a curl it's really
volumizing it's really black it doesn't
flake all over the place it is just
everything you need all in one and I'm I
to be honest I don't even really like
the packaging I think it's kind of like
cheesy but it doesn't matter it is so so
good it totally took me by surprise so
if you haven't tried it and you're
really tired of everyone talking about
the same mascara as la la la this is one
that is absolutely GMU d89
stamp of approval amazing this is mostly
drugstore this time around this is the
only high-end product on talked about
this is the Smashbox always on liquid
lipstick honestly the formula is okay
it's okay I just love this shade it's
it's a matte liquid lipstick kind of but
it doesn't dry down completely matte
which I kind of like because it makes it
a little more calm
well the shade is called in demand I
also like babe alert but this one I
really like I'm not wearing on my lips
today although this looks really really
similar but this shade is just the
perfect everyday color where you really
do look put together it does have color
to it but it's not like you're trying so
hard like a really bright red lipstick
that you're gonna have to futz with all
day
it's just perfect these are pretty darn
comfortable I must say so I'm gonna try
and see if I can find a drugstore dupe
for this shade cuz again the formula is
nice but it's not like groundbreaking or
anything like that but I just I had to
mention it next thing is a mascara
primer this is the l'oreal voluminous
primer i'm wearing it today with this so
i paired these together and i feel like
i know it's hard to see on camera and i
don't ever wear like fake lashes so most
youtubers are just like their lashes are
like mink coats just going up and stuff
but mine are like you can't even tell
they're there but for me my eyelashes
look great in person to me because i
paired these two together this is
amazing as it is it really is but i've
really been liking this primer it
surprised me because i feel like a lot
of white primers are just kind of
gimmicky like i feel like they're not
actually doing anything but this one i
love the brush it's that same l'oreal
voluminous brush which i already love
but you just again you put it on you let
it dry i've noticed that it's not
getting weird gunk all over and i've
been using this for a while so that kind
of blows my mind and what i like is that
the white is not peeking through because
in the past when I've used drugstore
white type primers for my lashes the
white kind of peeks through the black
throughout the day and I'm like what
like No No thank you I'd rather just not
use one at all but I have not noticed
that with this so I really really have
been very impressed with that
and I do feel like it has added even
more volume especially at the base of my
lash next thing I was so excited to
finally get my hands on these these are
the this is the elf well I don't know
I'll put the name down below and on the
screen but it's these elf little
highlighting beads and it's in the shade
natural similar to like the girl on
meteorites type and I used to have those
but I think the shade that I got I've
sensed it cluttered it the shape that I
got was like the lightest shade
and I feel like or maybe it was like the
next step up but it just didn't do
anything but these I feel like are
really nice they it comes with a puff I
usually just swirl my brush in the
actual beads but what I like I'm wearing
it today it's just a really natural
highlight it's not anything crazy I'm
not really adding anything right now but
but I just think it's just a nice blush
you could even put it on the tip of your
nose kind of just anywhere you want a
little bit of glow the look it gives
reminds me of the hourglass ambient
lighting powders because again it's not
a ton it's just kind of a nice finishing
definitely love these if you can get
your hands on them I bought mine online
I haven't seen them in stores yet but I
wonder if they will be soon I don't know
all right next thing this is what I'm
wearing on my eyes today I can't stop
using this it's this L'Oreal quad and
they came out with all these new quads
this one's in the shade French biscuit
and I'm wearing every single one of
these today what I love is that I think
it's kind of an interesting combination
it's got two shimmers and then two
mattes this matte right here is just a
kind of peachy tone one I used it just
under the brow bone I use it to kind of
blend everything together I used this
one here all over the lid this kind of
shimmery bronze and then I use this
matte Brown in the crease and then I use
this kind of shimmery well actually like
glittery black blue type shade in my
outer corner now this one does have
fallout you will have glitter on your
face so you have to be really careful
what I did is I just sprayed my little
brush I was gonna use with something you
could spray it with water you could
spray it with fix+ or a setting spray
I've used different setting sprays and
all of them worked fine but I sprayed
the brush first then got it and blew off
any extra glitter that was just hanging
out then I kind of worked it into the
outer corner just a little bit I still
had a little bit of fallout but I was
able to kind of brush it away and it was
fine so once it was set like that it was
fine but without it you do have it
everywhere but it's such a beautiful
beautiful shade here they are swatched
they're just so pretty
honestly my favorite shade really is
this bronze II shimmery shade that I
have all over my lid because on it I
want to
this entire week almost every day this
week I just put that in the lid and just
kind of blended it out to the crease and
that was it and it just looked so put
together a nice but really really quick
and really inexpensive as well so I love
these I have a couple more of their
quads that I'm kind of trying out but
this one I was just like oh my gosh I
can't believe how much I like it I feel
like I haven't found a drum store quad
that I've loved as much as I love this
one in years I really feel like it's
been years so I love that the product I
didn't really like this month is this
Elizabeth Mott blush and show me your
cheeks we got it in a subscription box
and it's in the shade peach pink it's a
really pretty color of course the
packaging is not her original packaging
it's one that she used for the
subscription box but it just doesn't do
anything it's a pretty color it swatches
okay but it I put it on my cheeks and I
swear like 30 minutes later it was gone
and so for that reason I'm like you know
there are a million blushes that are
really really inexpensive like elf has
three dollar blushes that stay on all
day and so to me there's no excuse why a
blush wouldn't stay on all day any more
in this day and age where there's so
much out there that's amazing for really
cheap so I was just like no a lot of
time for you sorry but I just don't
that's that last thing another favorites
a hair favorite my hair when I'm not
wearing at my natural curly wavy type
textured hair it's pretty thin like it's
not very I don't have very thick hair
and you can probably see it today but
this stuff blows my mind
it's the og X or organics is what it
used to be called argan oil of Morocco
elevated finish spray I tried a million
of these type products from them and I
you know they're pretty good none of
them have been like so good that I felt
like it just changed the world but this
hairspray is amazing it reminds me of
the Bed Head masterpiece hairspray that
I love but it's really expensive so I
like never buy it unless Ulta usually
will have good sales everyone smile on
that it is an amazing hairspray but this
stuff is really good as well and I just
feel like it I completely missed my hair
it really holds on to my hair but it
doesn't make it crunchy but it does it
does have a little hold to it like you
can feel it but it's not crazy crunchy
it's that medium which is what I need no
matter what
I'm doing my hair whether it's curly or
like this I I just feel like I need
there to be a little bit of hold a
little bit of texture to it and grit but
not so much that you can see it and it
perfectly balances that I don't know
exactly how much this is I don't
remember but I know you can find it at
drugstore so you just need to kind of
look around also online of course but I
love it and it smells really good too so
if you're on the lookout you're just
kind of an a hairspray rut and you need
something new that's actually really
good I would give this a try I'm
definitely buying it again once I run
out so those were all my favorites for
this past month let me know what your
favorites and also some of your fails
were down below I love reading about
those especially the fails don't we all
just love hearing about like crummy
products out there I don't know what's
wrong with me but I love watching those
videos too let me know what other videos
