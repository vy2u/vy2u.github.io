feel like I've been gone for a while I
was on a cruise but I was still
uploading some videos and I've even
filmed something that I haven't put up
yet but I'm ready to share some July
favorites with you guys but also some
that I actually one thing that I really
didn't love this month that I felt I'd
mentioned in a video recently and tried
it out so I wanted to make sure you guys
know that it's not very great this is a
sponsored video it's sponsored by nug
beauty and they I actually have some
favorites of theirs that I wanted to
share with you guys first and then we'll
get into the rest of my favorites so
let's go ahead an get into it so if you
haven't heard of nug masks I remember
hearing about them maybe a year ago they
kind of gained like a cult following on
YouTube because of these tiny little
pots of masks that you can purchase at
Target and I had heard of them had
wanted to try them and so they recently
sent me some and I tried them and I fell
in love with these two you know they
have seven different masks and there may
or may not be a giveaway that I'll tell
you about in just a second so one of my
favorites probably my number one
favorite is their hydrating mask and
actually my husband Tyler tried it too
when we got back from our cruise our
skin and you can if you see me up close
you'd be like because my nose is peeling
like we were putting on SPF like
freaking 50 constantly while we were on
our cruise and we were still getting too
much Sun so this was a godsend last
night we were putting one on and we kind
of shared this pot because there's
really enough in it that you could
totally get more than one use out of it
but we both put it on and it just felt
amazing you leave it on for a couple
minutes smells really nice it's um
camellia seed oil and spirulina extract
but it's good for dehydrated skin so we
left it on and we were just laying there
just like oh my gosh this feels so good
it was exactly what we needed the other
favorite I really like is their soothing
mask and this one shea butter and
chamomile extract and it's really good
at just kind of calming your skin down
so I think it'd still be good for dry
skin as well but I think it's just good
like if your skin maybe you've been
breaking out a little bit and you maybe
have some dry skin or some wine just to
kind of balance your skin all together
and I really liked the smell of this one
too is a really soft scent so for both
of these I love them all their masks are
amazing Paskus all their masks are truly
incredible and
have kinds for every kind of skin type
so definitely look into them I'll leave
links for this below you can get these
for like three bucks each and you can
also buy packs of five for like sixteen
dollars from Target as well so if you
knew like for me I know I like the
hydrating kind that's probably once you
figure out which one you like the best
that's the route probably to go but
awesome the other thing I wanted to
mention of theirs is their lip mask this
was awesome so I had this SPF 30 lip
balm and yet I got so burnt on my bottom
lip I don't even want to show you but
this was a lifesaver I had used this
like the whole month before I left and I
wished I brought it with me because it's
just totally you know this white formula
that you just put all over your lips you
leave it on for about 20 minutes and
then most of it will sink in but you
just wipe off the rest and it just felt
so moisturizing and I swear once I got
home and I started using it I used it
twice both the day we returned in the
next day I feel like it just healed it
so much faster than it would have been
without it so for me I really really
like this I left it in the box you guys
could kind of see what it would look
like but it's just a little silver a
little gold pot again you can buy it at
Target and if you're interested in the
giveaway there are two ways to enter and
there are two winners that will be
picked what you'll win is one of all of
their masks I'll have the info on how to
enter and when the winners will be
chosen down below if you are interested
alright so let's talk about the one
product that I did not like this one at
first I loved if you've seen my
waterproof makeup video which I can link
below chaebols blog but I love doing
that video and I was shocked at how well
the makeup stay but this one was one
that it stayed really well but it's the
sheen and the glitter in it that really
turns me off it's the Rimmel natural
bronzer and it says it's a waterproof
bronzing powder and it's in the shade
0:20 sunshine now they have a few
different shades and I haven't looked
closely enough yet to see if the other
ones don't have glitter but this one has
straight-up gold glitter in it and I put
it on today just to like ensure that I'm
not crazy and it's literal gold glitter
and you can see it it looks like I'm 12
years old in the 90s so when I just put
glitter all over my face because that is
what I did and I
I just don't like the way it looks I
think it just looks weird and it doesn't
look luminous in a good way it just
looks weird so for me this is one that
I'm probably gonna pass on I just was so
sad but it did say I'm well and
waterproof so I want to look and see if
they have non glittery ones if you
already know let me know which shade
next favorite I have on my lips so this
I just recently hauled in my ELF haul
although I filmed that quite a while ago
this one I cannot stop using it's the
elf lip balm it has SPF 15 no this was
not what I was using in the Sun when it
my lips cover but it's in the shade nude
and it's just a really thin tube you
just twist it up and I have it on my
lips today and it's become oh yeah
sorry I just I'm gonna put on some more
it's the perfect shade where you kind of
look put together I love this color but
I've just been using it all the time
even when I'm not wearing makeup like
last night we went grocery shopping kind
of late at night so I just put on a
baseball cap but I just threw this on
and it's moisturizing it protects from
the Sun and it just I think it just
looks nice so this shade I'm loving and
it's really inexpensive another product
now this you know going from inexpensive
to a little more expensive this is the
lorac pro 2 i just recently bought it i
was torn between this in the lorac pro 3
in the lorac unzipped and the lorac
unzipped gold like all of them I've
sworn between I ended up going with this
one just because it had such a wide
range of colors now I used this today
for my eye look I used mocha kind of
everywhere I use it all over the lid and
then up into the crease I used the matte
black to really smoke out the outer
corner there and then I threw a little
bit of rosy all over the lid what else
Coco I also used in the outer corner and
on my lower lash line and then I just
used like light brown and nectar and
buff to kind of blend and then do under
my brow bone with buff so I used a lot
of these colors and I just think it's
such a good range anyway it's just such
a wide range of colors and of course
like lorac always has in these pro
palettes a row of shimmery tight shades
and a row of matte which i think is
absolutely amazing these are really
buttery shades but they do like the
packaging does get really
really quickly so that was an awesome
purchase if you're really wanting to
kind of branch out and you haven't
bought any yet that's a good one if you
don't like really playing with those
colors you might not love it them
because there are a lot of colors in it
what I'm trying to bring a child so the
next favorite is an inexpensive one this
is from the brand makeup revolution and
if you didn't know which I think most of
you do this brand has been in the UK
correct for a while and in other
countries but it just recently come to
the States and this is one of their
baked highlighter palettes no baked
highlighter powders in radiant lights
and I bought this at Ulta pretty
recently and it's just this gorgeous
glimmery
kind of pearly white tone it's got a
little bit of a pink tone but it just
kind of do you see how easily that
blended out it just ends up looking so
beautiful on the skin I'm not wearing
today I'm wearing this other item I'm
gonna mention in a second but it's just
such a gorgeous highlighter it's really
really soft it blends well I've noticed
with a lot of highlighters I have that
are really pigmented like this they
don't blend as easily so once it's on
it's not as easy to move and it just
ends up looking like a strip
I feel like this blend so beautifully
and flawlessly that it never ends up
looking like you just got a strip you
know down your face so really love this
they have a couple of other shades I'm
thinking about I would need to swatch
them before I bite the bullet and buy it
with my hair beard right today in it
okay makes me think of like tonight
usually good alright so the next thing I
wanted to mention is the highlight I'm
actually wearing this was a surprise to
me I might have even mentioned it in
another recent favorites I don't know
although I don't think I ever did June
favorites this is the Cougar mineral
face and body shimmer and diamond kiss
and a lot of you guys told me Jessica
you've got to try it
and so cuz I was just like ah like I
didn't really care about it it's a
yellow loose powder and so when you
first put it on there's a lot of powder
there but when you start to blend it
it's like oh wow that's kind of
interesting and that's way too much but
when you blend it it's just this
gorgeous kind of well I mean obviously
it's highlighting but it's not super
shimmery it does have a little bit of
glimmer to it but it just ends up
looking so amazing and what I've noticed
is when I put it on
makes it look kind of poreless as well
because it's so finely milled it's just
unbelievable and I haven't looked yet
online to see like how much this is
straight up or even like do they have
other shades because I would be
interested to try others so if you know
let me know but I am in a research that
and see but I was so pleasantly
surprised I think got this in the
boxycharm is that right cool
so speaking of powdered mineral type
things this is one that I think I
decluttered and then I literally pulled
out swiftly because I might I might not
if I don't remember but in the end I
didn't and so this is the Maersk mineral
eyeshadow in your toast and this one
looks like kind of a champagne toast
kind of a color I'm wearing it on my
lids as while I kind of topped it but
let me get plenty oh oh no I just wasted
a ton it's just like exploded
but oh my gosh it's just this gorgeous
let me see yeah it's showing see how
gorgeous that looks and it's so much
finer than like the L'Oreal infallible
store even the MAC pigments are this is
just so like tiny tiny and it just stays
put it doesn't move and this color is so
beautiful cuz it's got that kind of
golden bronze but it actually has kind
of like this greenish yellow shift to it
as well so it catches the light in the
coolest of ways I ended up bringing this
with me on our cruise and I wore it
every single night because I just
couldn't get enough so I loved it the
next thing I mentioned is this elf
shimmering facial whip and if you
watched my ELF haul you know that I was
freaking out over this I'm wearing it
today on my cheeks it's this liquid
blush that usually these are more like
highlighting type things but this is
obviously more of a blush color and when
you put it on this is in the shade pink
lemonade it's just this gorgeous very
blue toned pink but what I do is I put
it on my hand like this get us any
sibling brush elf cells a fine one I
mean I think the one I was using was
from it cosmetics just the one I had
closest to me you just get a little bit
in there even dab a little bit off cuz
it is a strong color and then just dab
it on your cheeks wipe it off and then
just blend it with the same brush and I
just think it well for sure it stays on
all day I mean this stuff is like
freaking glue but um it just ends up
giving such a nice
Sheen you don't even need highlight with
it and I was just so impressed these are
so cheap I don't member if these are a
dollar or $3 but it's somewhere in there
I think it might be a dollar
they're amazing if you like like what
highlights they have more highlighting
shades of these that's actually
typically what they are so it's an
amazing option and it stays put the next
thing I wanted to mention is from scrub
love and actually this was sent to me
from a subscriber and I it took me a
while to try it just because I had so
many scrubs but I finally tried it first
of all it's a coffee scrub which is my
favorite kind of a scrub it has caffeine
which can be great for dull skin that
just kind of needs waking up if you will
but it's also more of a coarse one and
it has this smell that's like it's it's
making me hungry for it it's making me
hungry right now
it's chocolate coffee and oranges that's
the smell and actually there might be
all of those in it let's see yeah it
says it has coffee it has pink rock salt
and orange peel vitamins E and C sweet
almond oil and sweet orange oil I don't
know where I'm getting the chocolate but
it smells like it
it smells like those chocolates you
would get like at Christmastime or
whenever that's usually when I got them
that you break and it breaks into like a
orange so it's chocolate orange flavored
it is I think it's maybe like Palmer's
or something like that I don't know it's
amazing and my mom always gets it for me
every single year my mom and dad and I
loved it that's exactly what the smells
like the only complaint I have it I wish
it came in something other than a bag
because in the shower
I don't like opening the bag and getting
I'd rather be in a jar whether it's
plastic or well probably not glass I had
a glass jar I had made some of my own
scrub hey Jon I thinking about the glass
jar in the shower and I should've known
that athenaeus anyway but that's my only
complaint it is an amazing scrub my skin
felt incredible after using it I'm
really sad that I'm like a half of the
way down because I don't want to run out
but it's awesome
I'll put info on this below last thing I
had to mention another subscriber sent
to us me and Tyler and it's this Mickey
Kantor company brand potato I'm
struggling gain is lacking area it's
this candle from maple whiskey candle
company
and it's in the scent black the black
pearl as in Pirates of the Caribbean
this candle company has disney sense
like if you're a disney world not like i
am
these are sense that will remind you of
things like rides and things like that
Tyler and I always talk about this dank
smell and not think like that I learned
from you guys what that the other
meaning of that word is it's not what I
mean just kind of like this weird dingy
smell and this is like dead-on it's like
this kind of almost smoky which is
perfect for Pirates of the Caribbean but
also watery kind of dark smell and it is
awesome we've been burning it for a
little bit I'm like trying to like burn
it slowly because I don't ever want to
run out of it ever ever ever and Tyler's
obsessed with it too so we just fight
over it it's incredible I will link this
