going to share with you guys my January
favorites and flop so let's go and get
into it its future Jessica here this
video is going to be very long because I
just I'm about halfway through and only
three like five products so I'm just
letting you know now hunker down get you
a snack get you some coffee get you some
tea
so the first favorite is what I'm
wearing on my lists I'm actually working
on a video today about the entire line
of these and it is the ofra long lasting
liquid lipsticks now these are amazing
because they're an incredibly thin
formula you paint your lips with it and
it dries down I put this on about 10
minutes ago it dries really quickly but
it's not drying on your lips and I feel
like so many liquid lipsticks will do
the same thing but they dry down and
after like 15 minutes you I saw and it
just feels crappy and stuff but this I
did a wear test for the video that I'm
working on and I wore this through like
wine and tea and coffee in a whole meal
and dessert and it really held up really
well I wouldn't say like by the end of
the day it was perfect by any means but
longer than anything else I've tested so
very impressive it's the shade that I'm
wearing that I really really like it's
Santa Anna so the next product is kind
of newer to me it's this elf prep and
hydrate bomb they send me things every
month and you know some of them I love
so I'll mention them some of them I hate
so I'll mention them in a bad way and
then others are just kind of
middle-of-the-road so they you know
never really get mentioned but
definitely really liked it's the elf
prep and hydrate balm sorry to say that
I think mary said that but it's just a
stick it reminds me of their moisture
stick I don't daily moisture stick I
think is what it's called there is
similar but this is a little bit more
hydrating a lot more slippery so what
I'll do with this is in this very dry
wintery time we're going through I love
this stuff there because I've always got
to redness there I can just quickly set
it on and then I'll go work on something
else get my coffee made maybe and then I
come back it's sunk into the skin it
this is what I reach for when I'm really
in a rush otherwise I'll use one of my
favorite moisturizers like might be
niggling one that I like but if I'm like
if I've got like 10 minutes to do my
makeup I grab this and stick
go make my coffee come back and finish
my face so I love this I think it's
great for the price and you know else
really impressed me with their skincare
not all of it is my favorite but I
really found myself reaching for a lot
of elf skincare lately and if you
haven't seen my elf skincare video where
I talk about the best and worst I'll
link that below but yeah very impressive
stuff for really cheap speaking of
skincare this is from Scandinavia I love
their makeup finishing spray it's in
Scandinavia makes urban decay's I don't
know if they make all their settings
raised that I know like their their
all-nighter is made by Scandinavia
they're amazing they don't make many
products and that's what makes the few
products they made feel amazing I say
amazing that many times but this is
their post makeup recovery spray and
when I first received this in the mail
from them well like a month ago I was
talking about you know what is the ideas
this and the idea it says you're
supposed to be like five minutes after
you've washed off your makeup you're
supposed to spray this on your skin it's
supposed to kind of replenish your skin
of what you just stripped away and what
wearing makeup all day can do to your
skin it says our zinc infused myths
rapidly replenishes lost nutrients and
moisture immediately after removing
makeup highly purified witch hazel and
gentle exfoliant help prevent clogged
pores that can lead to breakout sweet so
I've been using just for like a month
now well I guess maybe more like three
weeks and I love it
like I get excited to take my makeup off
at night to spray this on because it
feels calming it feels like you're doing
something good for the skin I love this
stuff and I feel like it's really been
helping my skin calm itself back down
and the nozzles on these are awesome
they spray it so easily which I always
appreciate okay the next thing this is
kind of random so I've gotten really
into like dry oils and I say really
instant like this is literally the only
one I've tried so calm down Jessica but
I love this stuff because it's I think
it's really expensive but here's the
thing I bought it on HauteLook which i
buy honestly like the things that I've
eyes are high-end I just wait for a lot
of the expensive products that I own to
be 50% off on the look and then I go on
there and buy it and I'll link that down
below this stuff is so good and all I do
with it
coz there's a million ways you can use
dry oil from the way
understand it and I haven't done a ton
of research but I'll just kind of get a
little bit into my hand and it's just a
really thin oil not a thick seer in the
oil so I'll just kind of get it between
my hands and then instead of hairspray
this is second in here today so that's
what's up but instead of hairspray I've
been using this just like on the bottom
half of my hair so I'll heat style my
hair and then I'll just kind of run I'll
kind of comb through my waves or curls
with my oily hands and it'll kind of
keep them together a moisturize then
make them look so silky soft beautiful
that it smells good and then it's like
I'm perfuming my hair but I don't put
any of my roots because I get very oily
very quickly so that is a no-no for me
but I love it and I literally haven't
reached for my hair spray when I'm
wearing my hair down in well probably
like three four or five weeks so this
stuff is really nice I use there are a
million dry oils out there so I guess
really what I'm saying is my favorite is
just dry oil generally but this one
smells really nice and there's something
about it is there something on my lips
other than it was a note from oatmeal
that's very embarrassing anyway I just
feel like this stuff is very like
Parisian and just like cute and
old-fashioned and the smell of it is
very like in a way reminds me of a
Chanel type smell not like Chanel number
five so that's really a very particular
strong scent but almost like a lightened
version of that kind of scent but I
don't mind it I like it and again it's
not making my hair crunchy or anything
like that which all right so this is
another weird day I have a lot of weird
things that I've been not weird but
different things that I'm trying is
falling in love with this is from
tweezerman these are it's a light-up
freakin set of tweezers so you literally
tweeze with it oh I feel like I'm not
awake yet this morning and so I feel
like I'm just repeating myself I'm so
sorry there is a difference between just
having good lighting and tweezing and
having a life that's pinpointed at the
area it's illuminating eyebrow hairs
that I didn't even see in my like really
good makeup mirror light so I thought it
was kind of gimmicky they sent it to me
in the mail and I was like mmm but then
I tried it and I was like oh
my gosh like I get excited to tweeze my
eyebrows I'm getting you excited about
really boring stuff I know but it really
took me by surprise let's talk about it
done I always like to splash these in
here there
I love elf as you always know I'm up
front with you guys and a lot of this
stuff kids tend to me you guys know that
this is part of my job but of course I'm
always up front with you guys when I
don't like products and so this is the
elf micellar cleansing water I don't
know what's in this I'm being genuine I
have not looked it up and I will look it
up after today because oh it has this
very fragrant scent which makes no sense
to me in my cellar water because the
idea that micellar water is that it's
you know very sensitive skin compatible
and the other idea that is that you
should be able to use it not to rinse it
off well when something is this
fragrance a lot of skin breaks out from
that and I I just recently tried this so
this isn't why I was breaking out
although I have a feeling if I kept
using it and really irritate my skin but
I put this you know on a cotton round
and I would get my face makeup off and
then I would get another cotton round to
do my eyes now I've used like four
different micellar waters and I've used
the term as my eye makeup no problem no
stinging or anything like that well I
tried this and holy moly my eyes were
burning for like five minutes and I feel
like my eyes do get read easily so
that's never really a telltale sign so
my eyes are red every morning when I
wake up like I just have low tear duct
production or whatever that would be
called but it even says gently smooth
over the face and eyes to remove makeup
no need to rinse use daily to run use
daily or as often as needed
no it was horrible if you use it on your
eyes and it doesn't bother you maybe I
got on your back but I have a feeling
it's just it's just the makeup of this
that makeup that is comprised of that
it's just messing with me and I will say
I used this the past few nights
and I use because I thought oh maybe
I'll just not do it on my eyes will do
my skin my chin was burning all day
yesterday so again it really didn't make
sense this is the only other thing other
than like a foundation I've been using
forever then I put on my chin so I kind
of feel like it has to be this soap I
don't
like it horrible for sensitive skin stay
far far away
go on beauty list get the Bioderma or I
mean the Garnier micellar water I know
there's controversy with to some of the
ingredients so and again I a lot of you
guys have said yeah there are just
certain ingredients you know it's kind
of inconclusive so far so use your own
judgment on that but stay far far away
to this I know everyone talks about the
laura mercier translucent scent powder
you guys this stuff doesn't even make
sense
I've tried oh my gosh like 30 different
loose setting times I have tried so many
high-end low-end all of it this is the
best stuff in the world and what I
realized is that what I've had this
breakout here I'll put on like a
concealer stick or something on it I'll
kind of tap out around so what kind of
lens in a dress my skin and I'll just
take this powder I'll literally just dip
my finger in it and put it all over
there really thick and wait and then
brush it off kind of like baking is it
but it you can't move the product
underneath anymore literally literally
it the foundation or concealer
underneath this when you put on a thick
layer does not budge so I've been
wearing this you know I used to only
trajecsys but what I realized for me and
my skin even though I dry skin it
doesn't make my skin look any more dry
which makes no sense and I'll put it all
over my face and it just makes
everything blend together so much more
than if I didn't use this all over the
place I feel like it makes my blush
London and my bronzer blend into my
highlight zone I mean everything so
always put on top of all of it and I
know not everyone does that that's not
necessarily the best way to use it in
some people's opinion but for me it's
really working so and again it's just
makeup you can do it however you want
there are no real rules but oh my gosh
this stuff is stupid amazing you can put
it on top of lipstick and it'll like not
budge I mean it doesn't make sense how
good this is so if you've been thinking
about biting the bullet it might be time
for you to bite the bullet because the
more I use this more I'm like holy moly
this stuff is so good they were just so
freaking excited about makeup
alright speaking of looking a little
more flawless this is the bare minerals
concealer I've had this stuff forever
honestly it might be time for me to get
a new one soon
but it's their well-rested shade and I'm
sure I heard this from like Emily Noel
or someone amazing that I loved a long
time ago this stuff is so good because
it's this very yellow tone so again you
need a different tone if you're deeper
than me etc but I think this is one that
you know it can still work for a range
of people but obviously it's not going
to work for everyone but it's very
yellow very opaque loose powder and the
idea is that the idea is that it just
brightens it conceals the only downside
I don't wear this every day and the
reason I don't is because it can look
very cakey it's one of the few products
I own that can look very cakey so you
have to be careful I'll usually use my
little use just a smaller fluffy brush
you can even use a fluffy eyeshadow
brush honestly but I'll just put it on
my under eye when I really want it to
look a lot more brightened maybe I
really didn't get sleep the night before
different things like that when I just
feel like I need that extra I will use
this and it just I used it today
I really do feel like it does a good job
but I can even see even from here I've
got a mirror right here that it is
starting to look a little cakey so it's
kind of like it's not the perfect
products but I really do love it and I'm
consistently bringing it when I travel
as well you know for photographs and
stuff I don't know about like flash
photography it has SPF in it as phase of
20 I wouldn't trust it for that but for
everyday even just like regular photos
out in daylight I think it's a great I
mean I've used this ton when we travel
and it's been fine so I've got a pallet
oh my gosh
I mentioned that the bomb sent me a
bunch of stuff and I've tried a lot of
their stuff and I've loved lots of the
years some things I didn't but this is
one that I surprised at how much I liked
it and how much I can't stop using it
it's there the ball ma petite I shadow
palette and you guys taught me there's a
mirror here and they always have like
they're thicker cards with cardboard but
it's cardboard kind of packaging but I
thought oh that's so cute it says eat
your heart out you know then you guys
taught me that you can open it up and
let's all thank goodness because I'm
thinking I mean that's really cute but
it's going to be kind of weird to get in
there very glad so the names of this are
hilarious their food names like Bruce
shut up mac and cheese
race inbred Kate our top rocky road ice
cream what it doesn't really get but
these are unbelievable oh my gosh what
finger did I not use I don't know gosh
let me kind of just so that's what I
think wasn't as good as I wanted it to
yeah this it looks better when you find
at the brushing it wasn't as good as I
want it to be this one take our tops
it's really pretty rose gold it wasn't
quite I guess it can be but upon first
yeah it can be better but upon first
watch it's not like ideal but everything
else is the top row makes me big of
Neapolitan ice cream but I've been using
that like actually I used like the
little like lighter pink in my treats as
well as the medium brown they're
bruschetta I used under my brow bone all
that I use this in my treats today
already choked it
Alfredo pops I think I used on my lower
last one or trying to remember
so literally I've been using every shape
it's one of the very few pallets that AI
can get a complete look I can totally do
different looks with it and I use every
single shade so you know the one I use
the least is this jalapeno poppers but
honestly you could put that like all
over the lid it's a very like it blends
into my skin tone it wouldn't blend in
with everyone's but that might be the
only one I use a little bit less I mean
it's just not but I still like so
amazing it is so amazing it's so cute
again wait for this to be on HauteLook
it's half the guys just saying it's
worth let me say this it's worth the
full price I really do think it is but
if you know you can't swing it but
you're really dying wait for it to get
on to look and buy it because it will be
off
I've talked it to death and I've done a
separate video so this can be a very
quick mention but this milk makeup blur
stick is amazing I have a video all
about it if you are interested in it
where I explain what's what to do but
basically I'll put it on my nose or
anywhere I've got big pores I'll put it
on as a primer and then use maybe other
primer elsewhere that I need I don't put
this all over my face because I don't
need it but it is incredible
flawless thought it would be dumb and
loving it kind of a product so
definitely check out the video link
below so the next Pokemon I mentioned is
kind of an in-between but I wanted to
mention it because I feel like I don't
have as good of a follow-through like
all show at all and then I feel like all
either mention it that I loved it or I
absolutely did but I don't mention the
met in between products so I wanted to
mention a met product these are the
Maybelline dreams
what is it dream brightening creamy
concealers I use two shades twenty and
thirty they sent these to me I'd say
that they're met because they're not a
horrible product but they're not one
that I think you need to run out and get
but if you're looking for a creamy
concealer stick that you could use as a
face concealer I think these are pretty
good you should be able to use them
anywhere like their brightening so
technically you should use them maybe
under your eye if you wanted to cream
highlight with it there they're good for
that but again because they are they're
a decently creamy stick you do need to
set them so like a Laura Mercier powder
or I mean you could use any setting
powder but I do think you need to send
them so I've been using this darker
shade even though it's supposed to be
brightening it's darker than my skin
tone I'll just kind of dot it around it
kind of blend out the edges like I
mentioned earlier and put this on top of
it it doesn't involve day I could be
like rubbing my face and it will not
move and it's not that this is an
amazing product it's that this is but if
you're in the market for that and you
don't want to spend an arm and a leg on
a nice stick concealer I think these are
pretty good so I think they're like I
guess I should say they're like a step
above man but they're not like holy moly
this is the best thing in the world it's
just kind of in-between
side note I've gotten so many snaps from
a lot of you guys saying that you
literally download snapchat for the
first time just to be able to follow my
staff and that has made my heart so full
because honestly I got on snapchat for
the first time not okay the tunis time
terrible I got stabbed her for the first
time to follow other youtubers because I
was like what is snapchat so I got on a
my actually my niece who's like in
middle school had to teach me how to use
it too
forever to understand it but once I has
learned it and that I got to know it
better and I started getting stats from
you guys on like pull my graphs it's
such a fun platform because it's so easy
and quick but you feel like you're like
living alongside people and that I think
it's what's so cool and then I started
following celebrities and like oh my
gosh I love it I'm totally addicted next
one is this NARS oh my gosh
velvet look like what in the heck is
this stuff now I want like three more
shades it's I have it in the shade bound
it's a very popular shade it's a blue
toned mauve you know it's a really big
but it's just this whipped comfortable
lip product you don't need a lip liner
with it I would assume if you had a
darker one like a red you might just
because of the nature of just that color
but they're so ridiculously comfortable
they wear off beautifully throughout the
day which is huge to me so I'm trying to
wear it throughout the day and not
reapply I need it to just wear off
nicely so then I just end the day with
you know nothing on my lips but it
doesn't look like crazy and cracked and
creepy and weird does that make sense
I love it I love the shade I really do I
want to find like maybe if there's like
a peach peachy one and maybe I don't
necessarily know that I was like this
formula in the deeper shade only because
you know it's not meant to perform like
a liquid lipstick like this and when I'm
wearing a deep berry or a dark red I
will I don't want it to move and I don't
want it to look inconsistent and I think
the nature of this product is not
necessarily to look just totally all one
color I think it's kind of dimensional
and for me I don't like that in darker
color so I think I'm going to stick to
neutrals and light colors in this that I
do want to get another shapes if you
have a recommendation let me know
because naturally I'm sure I will place
a Sephora order in the next month
another quick favorite that I mention
all the time but I have to mention again
because it was a genuine favorite and I
thought about not talking about it but
in case you haven't seen me talk about
it so it cosmetics superhero mascara
this stuff is stupid this stuff is
stupid I'm wearing it today and I feel
like the lighting never shows my makeup
or lashes the weight as they are I'm not
wearing fake lashes or anything but I
feel like this stuff just holds the curl
volumizes like crazy you can keep
layering it I think
you can get a little heavy-handed like a
few but I did like three four layers
today but I love it because it actually
stays like this all day long and even
like I really like the covergirl super
sizer but I do feel like that and just
fit everywhere I do feel like that
eventually throughout the day you know
it doesn't ever look bad but it doesn't
hold it as long as this does this stuff
is stupid amazing I hate that I'm gonna
have to buy another one because they're
expensive but I am and a half to one
gripe I have about it in the packaging
like and I don't know if I'm just like a
messy mascara user but every time every
time I shut it and I've been using this
like a month and a half now like mascara
squeezes out and it's not as they're
like wet mascara but it's like you know
just some of it kind of goopy every time
and I'm like okay I don't think that I'm
like crazy with the way I open and close
my mascara but that drives me nuts I
wish I don't know how they can redesign
it but anyway this stuff is amazing I
have literally been telling everyone in
my own like personal life about that
mascara it's so ridiculous I have
another mint product I hope you like
that I'm mentioning I guess it doesn't
really make sense in my favorites video
maybe I should do a separate math
product video but I'm checking that
master and by the way again from Emily
well clearly she's one of my favorites
anyway but these were good and bad they
have good and bad qualities these are
these new elf pallets that they sent I
have it nude and smokey mapped I don't
know the name name of it if I find it
I'll put it on the screen but it's got
everything you need you know what I mean
it's one of those kind of all in one's
house so you've got three eyeshadows
this one's the nude one you have three
eyeshadows two-faced products and then
two lip products why are people still
putting lip products with powder
products I don't understand it or maybe
I'm crazy and there's a lot of people
out there that like that and maybe these
sell well but I don't see how because
once you use it a little bit like I
literally have any mints washes because
I'm like I have no desire I also don't
have a lip brush that I'm carrying
around with me to be able to reapply so
if I put this on in the morning I'm
gonna have to take this big supper with
me and
for us and after I'm done using the
liberal to reapply i'ma have to clean it
up before I put it in my purse like it
doesn't make sense to me I get it like
if you're a makeup artist and you're
having to apply a lot of different you
know using the same products a lot of
different people that make sense and if
you actually have the time to sit there
and paint them and retouch them but in
real life it doesn't make sense to me
but the products on this side are really
nice these eyeshadows are so beautiful
honestly some of the best
I think the elf has made again the kick
up powder but I can get past that you
know you tap your brush off whatever but
these are so beautiful I really like the
smoky matte palette because it has some
rosy tones here so there's like a
lighter and then there's like a medium
kind of mauve color and then a black I
have been using these three a lot lots
of powder them just really pretty I
don't necessarily create a whole look
with it I think you could I've used like
the medium mauve shade just all over my
lid and into the crease and that's it
just a very simple look and you're out
the door and then you can kind of use
the block to just kind of smudge around
the perimeter of your eye and it looks
really nice and really simple so another
favorite of mine is this beaker bkr
water bottle I heard a lot about these
this is 32 ounces I got on Amazon I just
was looking for and this is totally
random favorite obviously but I was
looking for a good water while that was
glass but wasn't going to break that I
could throw in my bag and not worry
about it leaking that was just
dishwasher safe like I had a lot of
stipulations of what I needed because I
need to drink more water and when I'm at
work teaching if it's not like once like
all drink like I had a smaller water
bottle and I would drink it and then not
have time to refill it so I just
wouldn't drink water but this one's big
enough 32 ounces that I'll drink this
all day long at work and then I'll
refill it at the end of work and so the
rest of the night I try and finish one
more and so then I'm getting 64 ounces
of water that's awesome but I loved it
since Watchers say it is glass like this
you even wash with it on kind of cool
the lid is totally League proof you can
hang it on stuff it is heavier and
the other gripe I have about it is that
they have a million colors oh my god
said like baby blue mint
it's kind of pricey but I thought to
myself you know what I'm investing in
myself and then I'm not using throw away
plastic water bottles I mean I would
recycle them but you know what I mean
and so I'm saving it that way and it's
one that makes me happy and it should
make last me a very long time I felt
like I was getting some kind of new
water bottle every six months because
something would happen to my old one or
just get really gross and grimy because
I couldn't just wash it and so I'd be
doing it by hand and I feel like I
couldn't get to the bottom and so it'd
get gross as I am iliyan reasons why but
it's such a good investment
they have like even bigger ones I think
that might be too big and it doesn't fit
in my cup holder they do sell a smaller
size in I think it's like 16 or 18
ounces my husband has that one in black
and he kind of said it's nice to de fits
in a cup holder said but it is he wished
it was a little bit bigger not as big as
this but maybe like 24 ounces so I
haven't found them anywhere online I do
wish they had one kind of in between but
I love it so if you're kind of looking
for that or maybe you have a gift card
for Amazon or I mean they sell this in
many places like sure okay so those are
all of my favorites and flops for this
month my birthday month I was snapping
that I turned 28 and literally a couple
days after turning 28 I found my girl
first gray hair I thought this is 28
okay I'm ready for it I guess I gotta
because it's posted so that was pretty
crazy but it was so shiny and glimmery I
called Tyler that gosh like when my hair
goes all white I'm going to be like
shining in the Sun anyway but it is what
it is so I hope you enjoyed a link all
