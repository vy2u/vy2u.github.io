going to share with you guys my November
favorites and flops I actually have one
flop this time around but it's one that
was more expensive so it's like even
floppier you know what I'm saying so I'm
it's like a super floppy flop and it
makes me really sick as I always do when
I am doing a sponsored video I tell you
right away in this video is sponsored by
Rio geo which I have been trying out
some of their products just on my own
and then they contacted me and I was
like yes because I was in love with this
one product I'm going to show you so
it's so perfect so this is their don't
despair repair deep conditioning mask
this stuff smells like almonds and just
like sweet goodness the way that I use
this product is when I do my once a week
like deep cleansing shampoo that I use
then I like to use a deep conditioner as
well because yes I like to get all the
product out of my hair with a shampoo
like that but when I use a clarifying
shampoo it does dry my hair out so this
is what I always pair with it I've been
using this stuff for a couple months now
and I love it what I do is I put it in
my hair and you can put it in roots the
tip I did it actually last night for
this week and so when I do that you let
it sit in your hair for five to ten
minutes I'll usually shave my legs you
know get everything else done that I
need to do exfoliate and then it's time
to rinse it out and my hair just smells
amazing my husband was just telling me
he always kisses me up here and he said
oh my gosh it smells so good so smells
amazing my hair is really soft I feel
like it's so much healthier my hair you
know I heat style it all the time and so
it's really prone to breakage and I
really feel like this stuff just makes
it look so much healthier feels
healthier looks healthier everything so
I love this stuff I will link it below
if you're interested in it it is one of
the best deep conditioning mask side
ever ever used so I'm realizing as I
look through all this stuff I think
everything except for two things are
drugstore which is awesome they're just
been so many amazing things at the
drugstore ladies that I've been trying
out and one of them is rediscovered but
let's start with one that was new to me
even though it's not a new product this
is the NYX pore filler and I actually
got this in a set from Ulta like a
little gift set they had and so I tried
it out I have never tried a pore filling
that actually worked like I'd put it on
and I would look okay but this stuff
actually literally fills your pores I've
never tried one that actually did it
it's like baby smooth you can see that
they're filled and then you put on your
foundation I use this today with the
Revlon Colorstay foundation I'm gonna be
mentioning in a second and it looks so
flawless like it looks flawless when I'm
really close to a mirror and far away I
mean it just looks so nice so this is
one that I can't recommend highly enough
and it's like around five dollars at the
drugstore so even if you're like me and
I've always been skeptical of the pore
filling type primers try this one
because I was blown away so the
foundation this is a rediscovered
favorite I recently bought this and a
darker is shade just because I felt like
it tone-wise fit my skin better than the
other one I've been using so this one is
in 250 fresh beige which I would say
typically would be a little bit too dark
for me give or take but it's been
working really well once it's blended on
at the skin and this is the one for
normal to dry and they finally here in
the u.s. have a pump on it which is so
exciting to me so it's less messy when
I'm putting it on but this stuff just
really is good and every time I try
other foundations that I end up really
really liking like I love the elf
flawless finished one but I retried this
and I'm like this stuff really is
amazing and it does stay on your skin
all day it doesn't break up on my skin
if you have really really oily skin I
would not get the normal to dry one I
would get the other one the one for oily
combo skin but I really really like the
normal to dry formula and I just can't
speak highly enough about it it's just
flawless and it stays all day the next
favorite took me by surprise this I
recently hauled in a recent video
it's the Maybelline Color tattoo crayon
is that what they call it and it's in
charcoal chrome and this is not
something that I would typically think I
would love but I really did love this
it's just one of those pointed thick
crayons it's in this kind of dark pewter
I just said that weird pewter whatever
um charcoal type color maybe that's a
better word for it it's why they need a
charcoal chrome but I use this on my
lower lash line I actually used it today
I've used it on my lid as well just
blending it out but what I do notice
about
I don't think they blend out as well as
other products I've tried but I think
it's really good for under the lower
lash line if you like that kind of a
darker look like I did today just
because it doesn't move all day you can
smudge it enough that it looks really
nice but like I said it doesn't just
blend away which I like for that purpose
but I really really like I was surprised
I liked this as much as I do and I keep
reaching for it every day so I think
that really says something this is the
only shade I'm talking so fast
take a breath Jess this is the only
shade I bought but I'm thinking about
going back and buying maybe a couple
more if you're wondering what's on my
lips it's the color pop like liquid
lipstick in bad habit which it's the
only one I have there's and it's I just
I do really like it it's kind of perfect
for this time of year alright so the
only high-end favorite I'm going to talk
about today
although I could probably talk about a
million high-end favorites but this one
really stood out to me it's a sigma
brush and I hadn't heard about Sigma 2
million years I used to be an affiliate
I think I still am but I don't have the
code so just I'm just gonna put a normal
link for this below not my affiliate
link but um this is their soft angled
contour and they said this to me a long
time ago and I just recently got around
to trying it it is the softest brush so
well made and I love it for contouring
but I've also just been using you just
for bronzing because you can kind of
flip it long ways and just really just
and just bronze it up and I just think
it's so simple to use foolproof soft
well made just across the board a really
nice brush and I just find myself
continually washing it and re like
grabbing it again to use that week so I
really really like it another brush much
cheaper is from ELF and it's their
highlighting brush where has this brush
been my entire life it is the perfect
shape perfect shape and I literally will
just dip highlighter in it and just kind
of and it's done and I think it looks so
I still have some highlighter on
I'm just using it's perfect you can just
get it wherever you might need it
they're a little up there I just got it
in my eyelashes anyway it's just so
beautifully perfect I I look back at the
old brushes I used to use for my
highlight and I just laughed because
this is so much better and it's you know
I don't know under five dollars so I
will definitely like this below honestly
it's worth going to the elf website and
ordering just this and checking out
because it is that good maybe order
yourself to I don't know I kind of want
to have another one so when I'm washing
this I have another one because I don't
want to use any other brush for my
highlight like ever again next one I
keep mentioning this I feel like in
videos but it is so good it's the
Physicians Formula youthful wear powder
foundation it's in the illuminating
finish you have to get the illuminating
finish I haven't tried the matte finish
one but I love this one it's not a
highlighter it's a powder foundation but
it just has this glow quality to it and
the way I use powder foundations I'll
either put it over like a just a BB
cream just to add a little more coverage
or just to kind of set my makeup and
make it look even more flawless I'll
just grab a big fluffy brush dig through
it and just get it all over my face it's
that's my makeup but it looks so healthy
and natural it doesn't look dusty or
cakey but it also doesn't look crazy
glittery or anything it just is perfect
just perfect and I've been looking for a
dupe for my it cosmetics version of this
there celebration foundation
illumination powder foundation and
honestly honestly you guys this is
better I like this so much more and it
totally took me by surprise so grab a
coupon if you can go get this from the
store or get it during a sale and get
one of their highlighters with it
because they're highlighters are amazing
this is the high-end flop that I didn't
like this is the sila smudge pot I love
steals eyeliners there stay all day
liquid liner if you can if you're a true
blue Jam Beauty 89 fan you know I've
talked about it for years but this one
first of all I like the way it smells
which I know is really weird it kind of
reminds me of play-doh so I smell my
cream products like a weirdo but it's
just in black and it's just not it's
almost as if when I dip my brush in I
feel like I've said this before my
channel maybe I have but like I'll put
it on my upper lash
line and try and make a thicker line
with it and it always looks like there's
a gap in the middle of it no matter how
much or how little of the eyeliner
product I get on the brush it's almost
as if the edges always look great in the
middle
maybe it's the brushes I'm using I've
tried it with like three different
brushes three different brands and no
matter what I do it's like this is too
thick but creamy and so it just skips in
areas it's really weird so I don't know
I just I feel like I wanted to use it up
because these are around like 20 dollars
and I don't want to just get rid of it
but like I hate using it so what's the
point I don't know so I would say stay
away I realize that maybe I got it done
I don't know the last favorite this is a
another elf one this is from their
skincare line this is their hydrating
bubble mass I have snapped about this
stuff to where I had it on my face
showing you guys like as it foams it's
just crazy you look like Santa Claus all
over your face but you put it on and
it's just like a normal cream you
literally all just kind of get some on
here you literally pull it off or you
push this down and a little bit of the
like gel cream it's just a regular Joe
comes up you have your face kind of
slightly damp and you just put it on
your face just a thin layer and then
that's it and you wait a couple minutes
and it just starts to foam and pop and
crackle and fizzle and all that good
onomatopoeia but and it just sends up
creating this like foam on your face
like bubbles and you just let it sit on
there for five to ten minutes and then
you just rinse it off and it's so nicely
moisturizing and also different it just
feels nice on your skin I'm trying to
get my husband and try this because
he'll do masks with me everyone smile
but he hasn't tried this one and I'm
like you have no idea it's crazy so I'm
excited for him to try it as well but
and I think it's kind of cool packaging
that you kind of push down on the thing
just interesting inexpensive skincare a
great mask so I would definitely
recommend that any of their skincare
line I'm trying a lot of it out right
now and I really like honestly I like
everything I've tried so far and I do
have a video I did a while ago on some
of the skincare they already had out if
you're interested in some more of their
skincare and kind of what my thoughts
are on them I will link that video below
if you are thinking about placing the
order on elf and you want to get that
highlighting brush but also maybe this
and some other skincare I'll link that
video if you're interested do you guys
see this hair that keeps
going like this though and it's like
creating a necklace on my neck hair
