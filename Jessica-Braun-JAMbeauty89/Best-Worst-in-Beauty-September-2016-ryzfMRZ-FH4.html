my September favorites for you and I've
got some flops let's get into it alright
I've got a lot of drugstore let's start
with something I rediscovered that I I
just forgot how amazing it is this is
the Milani shadow eyes and it's the
12-hour wear eye shadow and almond cream
and it's just an eyeshadow pencil very
very creamy very very inexpensive but
this one if you have a skin tone like
mine is the most perfect under brow like
brightener so if you're trying to really
clean up around your brows like I didn't
use it today just because I had it in a
separate pile for this but anyway it's
just awesome and what I usually do is
I'll just line right under and then just
take either my finger or a brush to kind
of blend it down so it just cleans that
area up you could use it to like kind of
highlight your face if you wanted to
like a matte highlight you could use it
like all over your lid and just blend it
so that it's a primer and it cancels out
veining it's just amazing it's the
perfect kind of all-in-one multi-use
product and I forgot how amazing it is I
feel like I should buy a new one though
I've had this for a while it's kind of
looking gross and I'm that shallow but
I'm gonna keep working on this on but I
just love it if you haven't tried it yet
you definitely should I want to try they
have like a brown one they have some
other colors I want to try some more of
them just to kind of get a feel for if
they're all this good next product that
excites me is the L'Oreal quads they
recently sent me a ton of their stuff
and I was a so excited so excited but
these were two that like I don't know I
feel like I never buy eyeshadow quads
and so even when I have them I feel like
I never used them so I was like you know
what this is a great time to try them
out make myself use them and see how I
feel about them you know just kind of
creating one look with a quad oh my gosh
I got so many compliments when I would
wear both of these it was unbelievable
unbelievable so I think if I had to pick
my favorite of the two would be French
biscuit I might have already mentioned
this on my channel I don't know but this
one's great because it's got two mattes
and one shimmer and then one like crazy
glittery shimmer now the woman fled or
does have fallout so you have to be care
with it these were surprisingly
pigmented so blendable and just
beautiful I would use like the really
bronzy shimmery one all over the lid and
just blend it into the crease and leaf
and it looked so refined and nice and
like with some depth like it was just so
surprisingly good and then the other
quad I really liked from their line was
boudoir charm this was another one that
I could use any of these darker colors
they're all shimmery any of them is a
one shadow look they all look gorgeous I
love that it's got this kind of burnt
wine color and then it's got another
kind of shimmery gold and then a
shimmery Brown and they're so pigmented
this is drugstore and it's really
blendable so beautiful I just love it so
I was very impressed if you're kind of
in the market for maybe something new to
shake up what you've been using these
are so lovely and I think even the
packaging they did a good job with
alright so the next thing this is a more
high-end product or more expensive this
is from benefit and it's their Corral
stay with me now because this looked
very gimmicky to me and I was like what
and I've never really used benefits brow
products I've never really been
intrigued by them and I am an eyebrow
pencil kind of girl like that's just
what I use I've tried powders I use that
for a while like the Anasazi one I've
tried like dip brow pomade once and
they're okay but I never like reach for
pomade type products more often than a
pencil this one completely changed the
game for me I don't know what it is the
color was perfect it's an in number four
and it's a cream gel brow and so the
idea is that there is the pot and then
you just pull this off and I thought I
wouldn't like this I love it I I think
because it's really easy to clean this
up because it is it's not like a crazy
pigmented gel like a gel eyeliner would
be where they have the similar packaging
this one is not so the brush I can
really quickly clean off and then I'm
not as worried about putting it in there
cuz with the cream liners I'm always
like like I'm putting that in and it's
not perfectly clean and anyway so that's
not an issue for me with this and it's
just so like waxy and so the color like
i'm swatching it there and it looks
scary it doesn't come on that way it
comes on just perfectly enough that you
can blend it with this bully so that
would be the only downside I wish out is
fully that just came with it but that's
another thing so I was just impressed
like I feel like I used it on my brows
today I feel like it's easy to use it
blends perfectly it's not taking longer
to do my brows but I feel like my brows
look better than they used to just a
little bit more fulfilled in a little
bit more even so I really like it if
you're kind of in a rut with your
eyebrows you feel like you need
something different it's not working
maybe give this a try I think you might
be surprised I know what it was
speaking of surprised this is from Misha
beauty and it's their glam art gloss and
it's in the shade SC r06
first of all these are pretty
inexpensive products compared to you
know like benefit and stuff like that
but the packaging looks so luxuriously
high-end I was so impressed it feels
well-made like it doesn't feel like a
cheap lip gloss and it wears beautifully
when I was recently in Chicago I brought
this with me and I was so impressed so
it's really really pigmented nice doe
foot applicator and it just looks so
gorgeously milky on the lips I loved
wearing it and so for me I have had this
in my purse I can't stop wearing it and
I'm not usually even that big on peach
shades but I've just been so into this
shade so if you're in the market for a
new lip gloss and you maybe want I mean
you want to just branch out a little bit
I would really recommend this I want to
try some other shades of this because I
fell in love and I was so taken by
surprised by how much I loved it and I'm
so glad it's not crazy expensive so one
of my fails well actually it's three
fails and one I have a bunch of shades
of the two-faced lip injection glossy I
was very excited about these two-faced
sent these to me and I was all hopped up
because I love Too Faced but you guys
know even the whole product is sent to
me doesn't mean that I'm going to always
love it and that I'm
you know not going to share it with you
I will and these I was not impressed
with so the idea of the lip injection
products is that they plump your lips I
like lip pump plumping products I don't
mind a little bit of a tingle I know
some people do I don't mind that these
however were an intense tingle like way
too much for my liking some people
really like I feel like Tati she
wouldn't mind this I know she like loves
that stuff she is so into that but for
me it was way too much I told my friend
Sarah I was gonna make her try it and
then I forgot to have her try it because
she loses her mind like she loses her
mime it's like icy hot or bengay so I
was like oh she will really lose her
mind with this but anyway not on your
lips not on your lips but anyway this
stuff was just too much for my liking
now the colors are pretty like this ones
in spice girl which I love the name of
and it was just again
milky color just a really nice light
spicy color but again they're just too
much so if you don't mind that then you
probably wouldn't hate these but if you
do then I would say far far away and I
notice a little bit of plumping I mean I
didn't notice anything life-changing but
I mean it is just a lip gloss after all
always nervous that I've got like bat
wings I'm drinking how speaking about
I'm drinking coffee and on the cup
there's like that's anyway but I feel
like every time I drink coffee like I
end up with like lipstick little like
bat wings you know what I mean makeup
problems alright so next thing that blew
me away
this month is from ELF and it's their
flawless finish foundation I feel like
I've had this product off and on but I
never really gave it a fair shot so I
finally got a shade that's perfect for
me it's in the shade sand I can't
believe how good this stuff is this
really blew me away it's so it such high
coverage but it looks nice on your skin
like it doesn't look weird or gross I
was wearing this the other day and one
of my friends said your face looks
really nice that I was like thanks like
I feel like no one has ever said that to
me and this is what I was wearing and so
I just I'm so impressed with the quality
of it given its price and I love that
the packaging it's
glass packaging a really nice I mean
it's like NARS type of a pump and really
nice thick lid so great packaging
awesome product the shade for me it was
perfect and I just can't say enough good
things about it so you'll probably hear
more about this as I use it more and
more last thing I want to mention is
from sleek makeup and this palette is
amazing
everyone needs to know about this
palette so their prices are absolutely
affordable and they now ship to the US
so this is their eye Divine palette in
all night long these colors are
everything they are the perfect in my
opinion mix of like neutrals but there's
some like wine and some olive type
colors it's just so pretty and their
shadows are always so gorgeously
pigmented and rich and blendable this is
another palette that every time I have
used it people always comment like about
what are you wearing on your eyes that's
really unique color that's a really you
know got a mix of a couple of mattes and
mostly shimmer which is that's kind of
the ratio I like I like shimmer more
than matte but it's also got this kind
of weird like golden green color which I
just think is kind of fun to pop like on
the center of your eyelid now these are
not shadows that are like I don't know
like urban decay shadows where I swatch
it once and it's just like BAM and your
face but then sometimes they're hard to
blend thieves are they still swatch okay
but it's more in the way that they apply
and wear and that's why I really liked
them I'm playing with a lot of different
sleek palettes right now but this is the
one that really caught my attention
because of the shade selection but also
I just like the way it wears it's fun to
apply it I feel like it blends really
nicely together and I feel like because
we're also inside of this makeup world
we get lost in swatches and we feel like
because something swatches so amazingly
it must be an amazing product but
sometimes those are the eyeshadows that
are not as easy to blend you know what I
mean so for me and for my everyday wear
I don't always want a really really bold
look in fact most of the time I don't so
I've really been reaching for these so
if you're similar to me and you have
similar tastes I think you would like
the sleek palettes but I really liked
this one some other honorable mentions I
figured I would mention
if you are like on the market to buy
some stuff from sleek this ones it's a
limited edition one so I think you'd
have to get it quickly but it's called
good night sweetheart and it is the most
beautiful if you like like those berry
tones I wore this the other day and oh
my gosh I loved it I loved it I loved it
I really like these shades but again
it's limited edition so if you want it I
think you have to get it really quickly
but the other one I think you guys might
like is an unnatural and it's just
really neutral colors but a lot of
deeper tones too and there are mostly
matte with a couple of shimmer so again
if you know you'd rather have matte you
like those Browns and stuff this would
probably be more up your alley
all of them are really nice the last
product I'm going to mention is from
Jake at beauty and it's one of their
highlighters it's a baked highlighter
called
well it's called you go nope it's called
you glow girl baked highlighter and it's
in the shade white goddess the packaging
reminds me of like the hard candy
packaging which I don't mind it's kind
of domed but this looks like crazy right
like it's a crazy stark golden
highlighter right isn't that crazy but
it looks amazing if you're very specific
about where you place it so like if I
just got a little bit like right there
and then just kind of blend it a little
it looks so nice on the skin I just
really really like this I feel like it's
so like I don't know in your face but if
you apply it really smartly it can look
really really nice so Jake at beauty is
pretty affordable I know you have to buy
them online which is always you know
that's how I feel I'm like I can love a
product but I hate when you can only get
it online like this and the sleek
product because it's like ah like I
would so rather just go to the drugstore
so I don't like always mentioning these
but it is really nice so I felt like you
guys need to know about it so let me
know if you're I'm interested in trying
more from Jake at beauty let me know if
you have other products in them that you
guys
really love I know not a lot of people
know about the brand but this is a
really nice product I like it so that
was everything I have been absolutely
loving this month let me know what your
favorites and your least favorites from
this month I love reading them and I
know a lot of us like to all go through
and read them just to kind of learn
about the products you loved and hated I
hope that you will subscribe before you
leave to catch more of my videos and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
