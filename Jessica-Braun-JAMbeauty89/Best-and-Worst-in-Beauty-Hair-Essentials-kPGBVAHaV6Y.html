I have my hair essentials for you so one
of my favorite favorite favorite hair
products that I've ever come across in
my life is the Bed Head masterpiece
hairspray you might not be able to read
it cuz of the glare but um this is
usually in like a deep teal colored
bottle but it was in pink I think cuz I
bought it back during like breast cancer
awareness so I've actually had it for
quite a while it lasted a while but it's
just it smells really really nice and
it's funny I feel like it's a hit or
miss smell because I've heard people say
that they hate the smell of it but I
actually love it it doesn't smell like
hairspray it smells nice like a body
spray almost anyway but it just it's a
really fine mist that comes out of the
nozzle and it just it's it has the type
of hold that you know it just feels nice
it doesn't feel hard but it still does
kind of keep flyaways down it keeps I
don't know it just seems to be the right
level of hold for me now if I want a
stronger hold I'll usually reach for
something like this this is the Aussie
awesome volume hairspray and I really
don't reach for this often I don't even
keep it with my like normal hair stuff I
keep it in my bathroom so like I would
actually have to go I had to go and find
this because I was like I use it maybe
once every couple months if I've done a
hairstyle that I need a ton of hold but
that's pretty rare for me so um but this
is nice and the Aussie hair sprays
usually smell really nice they're Sprunt
spray I think they still call it that
has a really nice smell to me that's one
that I always use like back in high
school and so just like every time I
smell it I think of like high school
memories and stuff but that's also a
really good one and that is more along
the lines of this a little bit more of
the hold that this has but um so I like
these two products but definitely this
is my favorite the thing about this is
it does it is pricey but I've seen it at
Target okay this is crazy and I didn't
buy it and I'm so mad at myself I saw it
at Target these are normally like $17
and when I bought this one it was on it
was like half that price
which still like nine eight or nine
dollars which is still expensive for
hairspray but I just love it and it
lasts me quite a while I want to say
I've had this since like October um
anyway but what was I saying oh I saw it
at Target for like it was two in a pack
for the normal price of one so it's
basically buy one get one free and I
didn't buy it and now I can't find it
again and I don't know why I didn't buy
it but yeah so everyone's how you can
find good deals I'm sure there are tons
of websites I know where you can find
good deals on salon hair products so
definitely look online before you just
buy it at like Ulta but I think that I
don't know it's worth the money I love
it okay moving on dry shampoo and this
is where I need your guys's help because
I've tried I swear a jillion dry
shampoos and I have never found one that
I love the closest I found would be the
Oscar blondie he has a sham a dry
shampoo that's for brunettes and so it I
think it kind of it didn't have a white
cast to it and most dry shampoos do and
I tried this one because someone had
told me about its the suave carrots and
infusions dry shampoo and the smell it's
alright it's better than some dry
shampoos but it definitely smells like a
dry shampoo and of course I was the
white cast and I I don't know I'm not a
big fan of this I don't know I just feel
lost when it comes to dry shampoos
because I really haven't found what I
like and I'm really sad about it because
it makes I don't know washing your hair
every day really does mess up your hair
like washing of a shampoo and but I feel
especially in the summertime when it's
warmer and you're sweating more often or
if you go to the gym I'm constantly
having to wash my hair and it'd be so
nice to be able to just use some dry
shampoo but it just looks crazy I mean I
do it properly you know I brush there I
let it dry brush there it still has that
white cast and I just can't deal with it
so this is almost gone you'll probably
see in an empties video coming up but
yeah I'm not a big fan so if you have
any suggestions dry shampoo hit me with
it
alright so for heat protectant sprays
this is my favorite again this I think
it's around 14 or 15 dollars depending
on where you look maybe a little more
expensive but I got a really good deal
on this I get a really good deal on
from my hairdresser but this is the
matrix sleek iron smoother and it's just
nice it's it almost serves as a
hairspray and I noticed a lot of these
do once you spray it on your hair and
then when you run through your hair with
whatever heat tool you're using I keep
looking over there because my curling
wand is over there that's quite looking
at it anyway but it almost it really
does help grab on to the style and hold
on to it kind of like the texturising
spray I told you about in one of my past
videos so I really like this I just
really do it it just seems to be a nice
balance between that it doesn't stiffen
your hair so much that it just feels
crunchy but it also does provide a
little bit of hold and I really do feel
like it is protecting my hair so this is
like my second or third bottle of this I
really like it and that I mentioned this
in my March favourites video this is the
not your mother's beach babe texturizing
spray and it has sea salt it says it's
infused with deep dead sea salt and sea
kelp I really like this these are only
like four or five dollars I've seen them
at Walmart and Ulta I'm sure you can buy
them online their whole line is really
nice I want to try their hairspray but
this again just add some texture to your
hair give some grit to it if it's really
really clean if you're wanting to do a
certain style where you'd need a little
bit more texture this is great and it
smells like actual coconuts not like one
of those sweet coconuts it smells like
actual coconuts which is really really
nice yeah so I really recommend this
again this is really inexpensive and
it's a lovely product okay another thing
is the I feel like I'm getting a cold
you ever have that moment like and
you're just like oh my gosh I think I've
got a cold if I'm feeling that moment
maybe this is the moment that I need to
drink one of those like effervescent
tabs that emergency no yes no there's
another one though Oh airborne oh my
gosh okay what am I talking about oh
it's a crazy day okay it's so rainy out
it's been rainy but I guess that's
spring for you right but I wish it were
sunny anyway okay so this is another
product that got to be powder 'fl and
this is amazing because you spray it
spray it you squeeze it it's like a
powder and there's like a little
but I used to just kind of - it straight
in my hair but um it would get in it's
of course a white powder so it was like
the dry shampoo would get kind of a
weird white cast so what I've been doing
is just dumping it in my hand and then
flipping my head under and getting it at
my roots
it adds amazing volume and what's really
cool is if it starts to fall at all
through the night like your hair is not
as volumize you can just run your
fingers through it like this and it like
reactivates the volume it is the
weirdest and coolest thing and I know
that the not your mother's brain which
is the same brand as this has their own
version of this and it's called girl
powder and that's really good too and
that's around four or five dollars this
I think is around four dollars as well
so I love this and I don't remember if I
read it it's the got to be powerful I
think I read that but it's great it's a
really cool product especially if you've
got if you want that volume I mean it's
a nice and I don't use it every day but
I definitely use it like if I'm going
out at night you know with the ladies or
with my boyfriend just to add a little
bit of volume okay this is one that I
would never have thought was essential
but it is amazing it's the suave vibrant
shine spray and what you do is you shake
it up and you can like literally see
like glittery nonsense floating around
in there and you spray it in your hair
and it adds shine and it has a great
smell this might be my favorite smelling
hair product I've ever come across but
it is the coolest thing it just adds
some shine it doesn't make your hair too
greasy or anything because it's
definitely some sort of like oily type
spray but it is the coolest product I
and I've never even heard of these
frankly until this past year I really
like this and I'm sure that when I run
out of this I will probably be rebinding
it cuz it's great and it makes my hair
smell great especially if it's like day
two and you're like you know on the
verge where you're like I could wash my
hair but you know what I mean this is
pretty awesome this would be my go-to on
Days oh my god okay a few more things
okay these are my favorite hair ties and
if you follow me on instagram I have a
picture of these from a while ago when I
bought these from a shop on Etsy and I
think it was like May May
a boutique or something but they're just
these hair ties that are I mean they're
simply just elastic bands but they're
thicker and then they're just tied at
the end but I really like them because
they're cute on your wrist like you know
they can go along if you've got like a
bunch of bracelets stacked or something
they're just cute and they've got these
little things you can have a bunch of
them on at a time
they have glittery ones playing one
shimmery like two-piece ones like there
and they have ones that are bigger like
for like a true headband but these are
just so cute and there's so many colors
you can get them for so inexpensive and
of course you could also just go to the
fabric store and buy some of this and
just make them yourself so I just think
these are so cute and fun they look
really cute if you like braid your hair
and put use this instead of a regular
ponytail at the end of your braid it
just looks almost like it's a bow which
is one of my favorite things so um yeah
they're just they're so cute I love them
and bonus they don't leave a dent in
your hair so if you're one of those
people that you know I and I used to be
like that
if you won't know any time if my hair is
stick straight and I put my hair up and
then I have a dent that bothers me but I
don't stick straighten my hair too often
anymore but these are awesome and these
would be great for you if you have that
problem okay the last thing again I have
a question for you these this is one of
those I'm like bun creator type things
and you put it in your hair or you put
it like at the top of your ponytail and
you roll your hair in and it the hair
just constantly goes around it and then
your hair is over it so you really can't
see this and they have them in like
different shades I think I bought mine
at oh I think I got it like hmm how
bizarre but anyway but they sell them
everywhere and I'm definitely you can
find them online but these are
interesting but I don't know I've always
I always notice that my bun is like too
big like grandma bun big it reminds me
of my grandma but and so like I've just
noticed myself not using this anymore
because my bum was always just I mean it
was still tight against this but it just
was too big for my liking
it wasn't quite the look that you want
when you do like a high bun so I'm
curious to know if they sell smaller
ones than this but yeah I haven't been
reaching for this as often but if you've
got a problem with creating a bun or
maybe your hair isn't quite long enough
to give it enough this would be a great
product for you because
here I'll be able to wrap around it a
couple times at least and that would be
great for you so I recommend that if
you've you been looking for a way to get
maybe a more volumize bun and I think
that is all and thanks for watching and
