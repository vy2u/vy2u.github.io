brand-new to YouTube and this is a brand
new channel and I decided to start
making videos to kind of focus in on the
best and the worst of beauty products
and hair products and fashion style
organization and even health because
that's something I think all of us are
kind of focused on being healthy and
being the best we can be whether that be
you know learning how to stay organized
and be organized but also you know
learning what products were great for
what skin types with skin colors etc so
um yeah that's why I decided to start a
channel and here we are and I figured
for my first video I would do a like a
favorites and unfavorite kind of review
of beauty products I've really been
loving and maybe products I've really
been hating so here we go we'll start
with some that will kind of go back and
forth one product I've been loving is
the bomb down boy blush and it's just
this really beautiful like pink colored
blush it's a cool toned pink in my
opinion and it's just really really nice
their blushes are always really really
pigmented and just kind of nice I don't
know their blushes are very luxurious um
of course they are a little bit pricier
but I really really like that I think
you will too um one thing I have not
been liking and it's something that so
many people recommend it's the NYC sunny
bronzer no for me I'm so fair-skinned
that like this would never work I should
have known it's so it comes across very
reddish on my skin and just it's just
bad news bears for me like look so bad
on me when I put it on but in its place
I found an even cheaper alternative
which is crazy because this is only like
2 or 3 dollars this is only $1 holla and
it's the elf clarifying pressed powder
and I got it it's a regular powder but I
got it in a much darker shade to use as
contour it's in the shade light beige
and it's kind of a gray toned um you
know if you can see that but I used it
for contouring today and it's just a
nice light contour color it doesn't come
across
reddish or brownish or muddy on my
really fair skin so if you're a fair
skinned girl like me you are going to
love this so go out and buy it only a
dollar and again it's in the shade light
beige and I'll list all these things
down below um something that I've been
hating is the it's just I don't it's not
worth the money it's a Revlon Colorstay
concealer I think it's like eight or
nine dollars and it's got the sponge
applicator and it's just like it's just
a mess like it kind of hurts to apply
almost and you twist it up and it comes
through and but the sponge is like hard
it's not like the soft sponge is like
the Maybelline ones that they have now
and it doesn't provide really that much
coverage I mean maybe I don't know if
you liked this I would like to know
maybe maybe for different skin tones
would work well but for me it really
didn't work and I got it in the shade
light and what's next has an SPF of 15
but I don't know I wasn't a big fan um
some things I've been loving the Sigma
brushes this is the sigma f84 angled
kabuki I do use it for my foundation
it's really really nice I used it today
and this is the Sigma f80 6 it's their
tapered kabuki and it comes to a point I
like to use this for concealer and
highlight just kind of blending those in
really nice brushes they're not as
expensive as the Mac brushes but they
are still kind of pricey so you know but
I think these are worth the money my
boyfriend actually got these for me for
our three year anniversary and I love
them ok um something I have not been
liking the elf cream eyeliner I bought
this a while ago and I just recently
started using it kind of trying it out
again and it's just it's okay but I love
the L'Oreal lacquer liner and the
Maybelline eye studio gel eyeliner those
are great this not my cup of tea it was
just too creamy almost it was just you
had to do a bunch of layers and it was I
think three dollars I'd rather spend
three dollars on like three of these or
something okay something I've been
loving my nail polish I'm wearing these
right now the main color that I have on
is the Revlon nail polish in charming I
love it and then also on my middle nail
have the selling insta-dry and lively
lilac it's just a really pretty almost
like light grape color but I love those
together I think it's just kind of fun
especially for springtime okay um I've
also been loving the jumbo eye pencil
sorry the NYX jumbo eye pencil and it's
in the shade sparkle nude and it's this
really pretty like orange color I'll
swatch it for you guys it's like not
orange I mean like peach it's real
shimmery and peachy and I like to wear
this under my eye and also you can of
course wear it on your eye like a cream
eyeshadow is like an eye primer or base
for your powder shadows it's really
beautiful and of course it lasts like
all day um another thing I've been
loving another elf product I always been
like surprising in these days the it
wore off but it's the elf shimmering
facial whip and it's in the shade lilac
petal and it's just you it's just a
little squeezy tube and you get just the
tiniest amount out and it is the most
shimmery beautiful highlight color it
reminds me of benefits high-beam but a
little bit more creamy but I have it on
as my highlight today and it's just so
subtle if you put on a really small
amount a little bit goes a long way and
it's only $1 yet again $1 huh love these
dollar products it's so awesome okay um
another product I've been loving and it
might quickly become a Holy Grail
mascara
it's the Maybelline rocket mascara I
just have the regular not the waterproof
it comes off with makeup remover I'm not
sure how well it will come off without
it but it's just got the rubbery
bristles you need one coat it sets
within like a minute so you probably
can't get a second coat on and once it
does dry or set it's hard to get another
coat on because it gets a little clumpy
but usually you don't need it because
it's really volumizing I have it on
today if you can kind of see it's just
kind of it's just a nice mascara and
it's simple one coat and you're out the
door
another thing I've been loving is the
Revlon balm stain or just kitten just
bitten kissable balm stain and honey and
it's just this nice kind of rosy color
of course it stains your lips for quite
a while too moist
rising they kind of smell minty and
there's you know what I thought there
was SP evidence but there's not I don't
know why I always thought that there's
not SPF in case you were wondering but
this is my favorite shade from that line
so I highly recommend that and a lip
product I have not been loving now don't
get me wrong I love the baby lips I love
the baby lips line but the ones with SPF
really dry my lips out and I'm sure it's
because there's SPF but this is just the
plain clear one I don't remember if I
had a name or not but it smells like
lemon yeah but it drives my lips out
like one application so it's a no-go for
me um I think that is all but um yeah oh
I wanted to show this shirt this I got
at Target if you follow me on instagram
you'll see that I posted about this but
it's this really nice like peplum top it
has a nice like zipper in the back
um it's I don't know I just really
really like this top it's comfortable um
I just really like it so I head out to
Target I know they have it in cobalt
blue - someone told me on Instagram
although if they're in the clearance
section they might be on their way out I
don't know but I really like the top
Targa has some good deals right now and
really keep spring clothes out so go
check them out anyway I hope you've
enjoyed this very first video that I
made and I would love it if you would
subscribe if you enjoyed it and of
course I would love for you to comment
down below and let me know what your
favorites have been what you have not
been liking now way I don't go out and
