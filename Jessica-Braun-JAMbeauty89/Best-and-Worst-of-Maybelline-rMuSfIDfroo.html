best and worse of Maybelline products a
lot of people have been requesting
videos kind of focusing on drugstore
products and what's good and maybe
what's not so good so we'll go ahead and
get into it so one of the things that's
by Maybelline that I absolutely love
are these Maybelline age rewind
concealer 's and I have one in an actual
concealer shade it's in the shade light
and so it's more of a yellowish tone
door just like I'm sorry more of a nude
toned color for under your eye not sure
if you'll be able to see it and then I
also got the one that's in the
brightener shade number sixty and so
it's more of a pink toned shade and so
what I'll usually do with these is layer
them I'll put on the concealer shade
first under my eye blend it out and then
I'll put this one on the brightener
shade and I'll usually make a kind of
triangle shape here and then even go out
to kind of highlight my upper cheekbone
and then blend that out and that kind of
serves as a really nice highlight that's
not shimmery that's not white or
anything weird but it looks really
flawless on the skin so you don't even
really need a powder highlight on top of
it but of course you could if you want
extra highlight there
I love these products they blend out
well the applicator it kind of seems
weird but it's really not when you use
it I kind of like it
and yeah I just really like them once
these are both kind of close to running
out I'm sure I will be repurchasing
probably both of these but if only one I
would definitely repurchase the
brightener shade because that this
really pairs well with really any
concealer so I like that okay one
Maybelline product that I'm not so big
of a fan of and I know I'm gonna get
some flack for this one probably for all
of these but it's the Baby Lips and I
own three shades I own pink punch peach
fizzes oh yeah I'm sorry peach kiss and
then the one that's just kind of like
the plain one quenched and I don't know
like they're not terrible but the ones
that do have SPF which I think peach
kiss they don't make them with SPF but
when I bought it it was SPF and then
quenched has SPF as well they're very
drying on my lips and then the ones that
don't have it like the pink punch it's
too much color for what I would use the
for so while they're not terrible and
I'll still use them I don't think I'll
repurchase any more of them because I
keep buying one thinking I'm gonna like
a different one and I don't I mean if
there's a shade that I don't have that
you know you love please comment down
below and let me know but I really
haven't fallen in love with any of these
three so I figure maybe I shouldn't
spend my money on any more of them but
my opinion you know my lips so maybe
your lips react differently okay a
product that I love from Maybelline are
the color tattoos I only own three
shades I own bold gold which is this
really beautiful gold shade and then I
own one of the limited edition ones but
apparently there's a barely branded
which is out that's really similar to
this but this one is in barely beige
which I use as a base for my eyes all
the time just a really nice pearl color
and then I also own let's see bad to the
bronze which is this nice bronze kind of
almost taupe color when you actually
apply it this one is a really nice
crease color but again any of these I
reach for these two the gold one and the
pearl one more often for like kind of an
all over the eye look you can wear them
alone you can wear them as a base these
are just great products they're around
six or seven dollars at the drugstore
and they always have fun limited limited
edition ones coming out and they also
have really bright colors I don't
usually opt for those just because it's
not my style but they have some
amazingly powerful colors out there so
if you're into that or if you have
really dark skin tone they would look so
beautiful on you ladies so if you
haven't tried these definitely try one
out I would I would recommend one that's
more of a pearl shade to start out with
just you can use it as both a base and
just an all over the lid color if you
want cuz it's just so versatile I
haven't I've had all of these for
probably two years if that may be your
and a half and none of them have dried
out on me they're just really nice and
they're apparently akin to the Mac Paint
Pot so if you're looking for a cheaper
alternative those are a great way to go
okay another favorite from Maybelline is
the Maybelline rocket mascara I talk
about it all the time I wear it every
single day it's kind of one of those
rubberized brushes with these rubbery
bristles it sets kind of quickly like
within a minute so you kind of got to
know what you're doing and get in there
and get to work before it dries but once
it dries it's a really nice look I think
it separates the lashes pretty well and
it just it it holds the curl all day for
me I just really like it I don't get the
waterproof typically ever in mascara
unless I'm like using it just to swim
but I really like this one and even
though I don't use the waterproof it
seems to kind of be waterproof which is
kind of nice you know right now it's
allergy season so my eyes are itching my
eyes are watery I'm constantly trying
not to interesting them but I do you
know so this has been a great mascara
for that as well so if you do suffer
from allergies or just watery eyes this
might be really nice and you don't even
have to get the waterproof formula but
you definitely do need a makeup remover
to use this so keep that in mind okay
something I've not been a big fan of
from Maybelline it's kind of worn off
but this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer and I got mine in the shade
light and I probably should have gotten
a shade lighter but I I don't know I was
hoping this was more of like a yellow
tone concealer I noticed so I don't know
if you can kind of see that but um I
don't know it's okay but I'm not gonna
repurchase it and I don't think it was
worth the like eight dollars that I
spent on it you know and Maybelline does
make a good concealer so I think I'd
rather spend my money on these than on
another one of these but um I just I
used to I think I post on Instagram like
a long time ago when I first got this
that I was really loving it but I
realized that five hours into my day
each time I wore this all of my dark
circles would just peep through and I
was like what I was like that is not
what I want my concealer to do so I've
been trying to use this to just use it
up but once it's gone I can't wait to
toss it and be done with it okay one
thing that I'm kind of medium about on
the fence is the dream matte powder and
everyone talks about this it's you know
kind of a cult favorite when it comes to
powders but I don't know I haven't
really noticed anything remarkable about
it I really like my Rimmel stay matte
powder
that has worked so well for me over the
years that you know I bought this
thinking it would be similar and I guess
it is but I think this is almost a
little bit more powdery than that now I
think that if rimmel ever discontinued
their stay matte powder which I think I
would sob the day that that happened but
if they did I think maybe this would be
second choice but it's not my favorite
but if for some reason Rimmel is not
sold in your area this would be a nice
alternative so it's not a bad powder but
it's just not my favorite okay ooh the
maybelline superstay lipstick one of my
favorite lipstick formulas of all time
it smells incredible oh my gosh
it smells like berries and it the
formula is moisturizing but not too it's
not like a wet look at all but it stays
on for a long long long time and as it
wears off it wears off nicely it doesn't
wear off in weird patches or anything
like that I haven't noticed that it
dries my lips out I love this this is my
favorite shade it's in perpetual peony
it is this beautiful beautiful cool
toned pink oh my gosh is gorgeous and if
you again if you have darker skin tones
this is going to look incredible on you
but I think it even looks nice on pale
skin so I think any skin type will love
this color on them and it's beautiful it
stays on and I love the smell and they
have a lot of color choices for that
line but that's just my favorite okay
another thing that I've been kind of on
the fence on is the Maybelline BB cream
and I got it in the light sheer 10th
tint it has an SPF of 30
of course it says it's an eight and one
beauty balm who knows I mean they make
all these claims who knows but I've
talked about this a lot on Instagram
because people are saying you know I'm
surprised you like that it kind of looks
you know orange on my skin or it's too
dark for me or you know there's lots of
different things and opinions people
have on all the BB creams but I liked it
at first I don't notice that it turns my
skin orange it actually kind of matches
my skin tone pretty well and I think for
a light you know just something on your
face if you're in a rush it's not bad
and it's easy to apply but I don't know
I don't know you know what I mean I
never reach for it
unless I know that like maybe I'm gonna
be out garage stealing or out doing yard
work I don't know I don't ever do yard
work what am i talked about but you know
what I mean those occasions where you
just feel like I don't really want to
waste foundation on today I'll reach for
it but I never really like the way I
look at it I just noticed that it's okay
it's better than just my plain skin but
long story short it's okay it's more
like a tinted moisturizer than anything
I won't repurchase it but I'm not just
gonna like throw it away like also use
it but I don't know I guess this would
be good like on a beach vacation to
throw this on instead of you know
foundation you know what I mean just
because it does have that SPF but I
think you might want even higher than
SPF 30 on your face if you're on the
beach like you know it's okay all right
let's see another thing is the
Maybelline eye studio quad I love these
the only con is there is a lot of fall
out but my friend Sarah sent these to me
and they're amazing and my favorite one
is the taupe temptress I just brought it
up in my April favorites recently it's
just a beautiful they have so many
different quads these are all beautiful
they're so pigmented and this one is in
let's see smoky cinnamon and it's got
these green like olive colors in like a
chartreuse color and then this beautiful
cinnamon color love them they always
have like a highlight type of color
they're beautiful but there is a lot of
fall out so you really have to shake off
your brush they have those like guards
like and I know ELF sells one where you
can hold it while you apply so the
fallout lands on the little like guard
thing but they just make me laugh that's
way too much work for what it is you
know what I mean I don't know that's
just my opinion but these are beautiful
if you haven't checked them out
definitely go pick one up in a color
selection that you really like that
would you know kind of go with your eye
type because they really make my eyes
pop I really really love these and I
find myself reaching for them all the
time like even over my naked palette
which never happens
okay another honestly favorite is the
Maybelline one by one and a lot of times
I'll use this in conjunction with my
Maybelline rocket it's another
rubberized brush but it really does
separate lash as well I wear it alone
sometimes but it's not my favorite on
its own but when it's paired in
conjunction with a very volumizing one
this will separate the lashes really
nice and again the formula it does stay
so I really like this I recommend this
if you don't like that really really big
voluminous look and you like your last
should be really separated and soft
you're gonna love the one by one Volume
Mascara it's just I really like it and
I'll ready purchase it again because it
is really good in combination with other
mascaras so and that is all my
Maybelline best and worst products I
hope you learn something new if you have
any more recommendations for Maybelline
products your loving or maybe once
you're hating that I should stay away
from please let me know down below and I
will talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
