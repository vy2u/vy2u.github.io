have a quick video for you guys I was
thinking about kind of brands that I
featured on my channel and a lot I used
to do a lot of like gems of the
drugstore or where I would just kind of
do brand overviews and just kind of show
you and share with you my favorites and
least favorites of the brand and then I
thought why never really do that for
high-end and then I was like oh that's
because I don't own that much high-end
stuff that I could really say okay let's
talk about NARS I have like a NARS
praten have a NARS product anymore I
might not have anything from NARS
anymore so that's kind of too difficult
for me to do but then I thought you know
what the realm of high-end
there's kind of this medium ground that
a few brands kind of fall under and one
of the brands that I thought of is the
ball and then it was on its let me
rephrase its on HauteLook right now
which means it's like 50% off and I
thought why not do this now get it up
for you guys because this is a brand
that I would never have bought full
price I would hear about them on YouTube
and I'd be like oh and I kind of add it
to my wish list that I'm sure most of us
have like a list of things you want to
eventually get but then I would never
have bought them because like the
plushies are $20 and the eyeshadow
palettes are just as expensive as any
other palette and so it's one of those
things that I was like I don't know but
then when they start started appearing
on whole look in the blushes were all a
sudden ten dollars and the palettes were
all of a sudden only nine fifteen or
twenty almost like maybe and so that's
how I first started buying them now I
only have four products in the bulb that
I absolutely adore that I wanted to
mention to you guys there are a few
products that are on my radar that I
eventually want to try and I'll mention
those at the end but I figured I would
let you guys know about the brand now
that way you can check it out while it's
still for crazy cheap on HauteLook right
now I think it's only for like maybe
three days on there so definitely check
it out because that look is a flash sale
site so the link is below let's go and
get started one of my favorites and my
friend amber actually sent me this one
is the mary lou manizer from the balm
and it's just this beautiful shimmery
powder and obviously it's marketed as a
highlighter but you can also use it as a
really shimmery eyeshadow and it does
even say that it says highlight
highlighters
shimmer and eyeshadow it's one of those
that it's as a highlighter it's almost
too much so you have to be really really
conscious of how much you're using of
this and look at it in different lights
because if you step out into the
sunlight and you've got a streak of this
on you're going to be so embarrassed
stop on to me before but it's so it's
really really strong but it's beautiful
as an eyeshadow too it looks a lot like
steal a kitten so this right now is like
ten or eleven dollars on the site is
usually 20 bucks two of my blush
favorites from them and a lot of people
ask which blushes I would recommend
because they have a lot they have the
insane blushes and then they have like
their classic line and I own two from
the classic line one that I got a little
later I don't know why I put that quotes
I got it like recently is the hot mama
blush and this is just a really really
peachy coral very shimmery without
actual specks of glitter kind of blush
what I love about it is the way that it
blends into the skin both know I guess I
would assume all of their blushes but at
least in these two they blend so
flawlessly so they never look splotchy
and they're shimmery one the hot mama is
not it's just not shimmery I mean it's
got a sheen but it doesn't look like
weird flecks of glitter like some
glittery or shimmery blushes do so I
love that and this is like one of the
very few coral colors that I actually
like on myself and this is always the
one that I grab and use when I'm like
going out on the town this is the one I
always use because I just love the way
it makes me look and feel so I love this
this is ten dollars on the site the down
boy blush from the balm it's the
prettiest most perfect pink color it's
completely matte again ridiculously
pigmented but blends so flawlessly on
the skin the packaging to all of these
is like this kind of thicker cardboard
paper but I've had this for like three
years and I've never maybe two years
it's never bothered me really it's easy
to travel with they're all so thin so
the last thing I want to mentioned but
it's not a part of the sale but in the
spirit of sharing what I like from the
balm I've got to mention it because it's
one of my favorites it's the shady lady
from the balm palette this is their
Volume one
palate they have I think three maybe
even four volumes of it but it just has
nine shadows a really nice mix of
shadows most of them are shimmery or
like a satin finish not even some of
them look kind of matte but I would say
they're more of a satin finish but all
of them are beautiful
it's the palette I reach for more than
anything I travel with this a lot
because of the selection of colors I
think when I got it on there it was like
twenty dollars instead of like 40 but
they have their new tude palette which
I'll insert a picture of here because I
don't own it but it's got a ton of
shadows really natural colors but also a
lot of selection and from what I've
heard it's just as buttery as all their
shadows are they're just so luxurious
and that ones on the site as well and
I've heard nothing but good things about
that so some of the products they're
kind of on my wish list that I might be
purchasing this time around I've got my
eye on the in stain blushes they have a
huge selection they're essentially the
same thing just different packaging but
they kind of like from what I've heard
that somehow it kind of like stains your
cheeks I don't know if it actually does
or if it's just saying that it's really
great saying powder power powder powder
on the brain what I will say about the
classic blushes which they also have
frat boy and cabana boy which are also
wonderful these stay on all freaking day
they stay on longer than my math blushes
do they stay on longer than my tart
blushes do these stay on all freakin day
it's crazy whoa
so um I've got my own insane blushes
I've also heard that the time what does
it call the time bomb concealers I've
heard those are really good and really
really creamy and that they don't crease
I'm not sure how to try them but I've
heard those are amazing they have a
whole line of skin care as well I've
never tried any of it I kind of want to
look it up on polished choice and see
like kind of how each of the items rank
and if they're good if they've got great
ingredients or if it's kind of so-so or
half-and-half so I might look that up
and look into their skin care just cuz
why not but they also have like hair
care stuff I think they've got dry
shampoo but I haven't tried any of this
so I do want to try some of those
products anyway so link below for that
sale
last for like three days like I said and
it's on HauteLook probably every couple
of months so you know if you miss it
this time around sign up for an account
at least and you can like what I do is
I'll add a reminder when I see it's
coming up I'll just add a reminder on my
phone so I would love to know what your
guys's favorites from the bomb are so
let me know down below if you've tried
some things that I didn't mention that
you love because like I said I'm kind of
looking to buy some more stuff from the
bomb and I hope this video is helpful
for you guys and I'll catch you guys
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
