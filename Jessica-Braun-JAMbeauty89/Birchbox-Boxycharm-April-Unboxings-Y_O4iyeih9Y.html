an unboxing for you this will probably
be a quick one this is my boxy charm and
I also have my Birchbox so let's dive
right in the boxy charm is $21 a month
it is pricier but you usually get more
full sized items the theme for this
month is boho glam ooh
the very first thing are these pur
cosmetics like beauty sponges three of
them
so my they field may be too dense let me
go wet when I'm sure it's the sea so it
got of course substantially bigger and
it feels pretty topic I do think it's a
little bit denser than a Beauty Blender
typically is but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's bad not everything
has to be exactly like the Beauty
Blender so I am excited to give you try
and my dog no-kill tune up my brand new
black one I'm so excited to have a Black
Beauty Blender why I don't know it just
one on one and I'm so excited I finally
bought it and those suckers are twenty
dollars and he chewed a chunk out of it
I'm still using it like I'm using it for
like baking you're like putting on you
know powders and stuff but I want but
this is awesome so I'm excited I think
that's awesome it came with three
alright next thing in here I have fits
or maybe it's similar this is the
project beauty hair Girt in strawberry
banana I feel like the thing I had
before it was like a leave-in something
but this is the shampoo so that's
intriguing it says it's got quinoa
sulfate paraben free and it's helped it
will help tame unruly frizzy and dry
hair hmm that sounds like my hair so I I
will give that a try this is an
interesting bulk so this next one oh
it's kind of broken
so Oh for a highlighter in Rodeo Drive I
happen to already have this I guess it's
not broken it's just like powder got
everywhere and that's the thing it's
hard to ship it really is a pretty
highlighter though it's like the most
ridiculous golden highlighter ever I
really do like this I'll probably pass
this on to a friend I just need to kind
of wipe it down but it's not broken that
is good so awesome that if I didn't have
that be very
I feel like I got my know in a boxy
charm
either way it's we both eyeliners are
really really good oh I always forget
so the three-piece blending sponges were
$36 yeesh
the highlighter is 35 the hair Girt is
$10 so the next product in here is from
cargo gosh where's Carville Ben you know
I feel like I used to like really care
about that brand and now I feel like I
don't know and what are their good
products what what have you guys tried
that you really liked I know a lot of
people used to like they're like HD
powder anyway so this is a gloss retails
for $16 and it's in the shade Umbria
oh so the dough foot is really flexible
but like too much after Larry try to
wipe it new one and it's like not wiping
the gloss I wonder if it's supposed to
be like that it's just kind of a sheer
wash kind of a beige e golden color it'd
probably be really pretty maybe on the
center of your lip so that's pretty cool
and again it's the full size and cargo
is still in my opinion and Express the
brain awesome so the last thing in here
I thought look like chocolate it's the
concealer collection from indie
measurable difference so oh wow that's
way more than I anticipated so it
literally has all these concealers and
it's got some warm tones some deeper
tone some lighter a pretty decent range
okay I can tell you right off the bat
they're really inconsistent because like
one of them is really creamy and the
other one's kind of dry mmm I don't know
I don't know I might try it you know but
they don't feel very good quality and
which concealer you don't really want to
mess around if you're taking the time to
really conceal and match things you want
one that you know will work so so out of
that the boxycharm I really really like
the highlighter of course and the 3-pack
of Beauty sponges I feel
finches I don't you can never have too
many and that's right like that and the
lipgloss seems pretty nice too so not
bad I only did my favorite month but
Salemba let's move on to first okay I
love the message behind this literally
so you open it and it has this right on
top and I notice you know the box is
kind of plain which it usually is really
colorful and patterned you know it says
pretty beauty packaging might have us at
hello but in the long run it's what's on
the inside that matters the most I guess
that's not it's sweet I mean they're
just talking with packaging but of
course I'm just saying about life you
know anyway
awesome I can't wait let's dive in so
the first thing when my favorite brands
this is the RMS beauty what are they the
ultime cup remover wife I didn't even
know they made those
so these retail like a people out a pack
of 20 wife for $16
that's awesome looks like there's like
coconut oil in it that's pretty cool so
totally excited to try these these are
perfect for travel to remove makeup so
you're not having to bring like a
separate makeup remover especially if
you're flying and you don't want to
worry about that many liquids so that's
pretty cool
next thing is this Marcel BB cream in
golden glow and so this the full-size
retails for 29 per been free oil Oh wood
started filling out paraben free oil
free it's of course much too dark for me
hey maybe I could use that with my I
just um I just did a haul of the four
products I just I just filmed a Sephora
haul just before this video and it's way
too light for me maybe I can use this to
mix it with but it seems really nice and
creamy and like really soft actually um
so it says it gives it a golden glow
while controlling shine and masking
imperfections but I did the little dark
anyway okay next thing a mica one of my
favorite hair brands this is the
bombshell blowout spray the full size of
$24 smells pretty good there's stuff
always smells really good is this the
brand I think you know it says this is
the star ingredient of the brand
it's got seabuckthorn berry and
intentionally intensely nourishes hair
so lightweight styler volumizing mousse
and perfects for a sleek Wow feet do
says it can even kind of texture so
that's pretty cool I will definitely
give that a try next thing in here is
this hashtag girl power liquid lipsticks
oh it's one of those very very thin
friends Nina Kat Von D formula very thin
but packs a big punch color wise and
dries down pretty quickly I'm kind of I
don't know are you guys getting over
liquid lipsticks the way I am I just
kind of am tired of them I have a whole
bunch of my collection I don't wear them
that often but the packaging is really
pretty and this color is pretty it's in
the shade I'm a ball mouse i MMA all one
word and involves be a wse so the last
product is from super goop there's Sun
defying centering oil with metal foam
SPF 50 the full-size of 34 how does this
work it's non greasy sunscreen prevents
moisture loss texting it's free radical
damage and leaves skin curiously soft
yeah so it is a spray oh my it
definitely has a strong sense be aware
of that but that's cool I've never tried
a sunscreen that's like an oil like this
that actually has SPF usually if it's an
oils like for tanning which also by the
way the inside of the box is really cool
I might use this to store makeup in -
that's cool so not bad I'm really
excited about the RMS wipes even though
it's only two of them and I'm really
excited about the sunscreen and the hair
product
the lip product is nice will I use at a
ton I don't know
and then the Marcel I might still try to
use maybe mixed in with some stuff but
yes so I don't think this is my favorite
month for either box if you're
interested to see some of my past
unboxing I will link my a huge playlist
down below you can kind of pick through
what you would like to see and otherwise
I will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
