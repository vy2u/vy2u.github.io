got the birch box unboxing for january
2014 and this is actually the first
birchbox i've gotten in a long time
because i canceled my subscription
because i just hadn't been happy but
lately i've been watching a lot of
birchbox videos of other people here on
youtube and I've been really impressed
I'm like dang they stepped up their game
so I was like man I'm about to subscribe
again so I did and so this is the first
one I've gotten in quite a while to be
completely honest so here it is the
birchbox and I've already opened it
already looked at but that it comes with
this info card as they all do with it's
got the full size retail prices on it so
Birchbox is ten dollars a month if you
don't know and it comes with I think
typically for products and then one
lifestyle extra you'll see what the
lifestyle lecture was for this time okay
so first things first the thing that
made me laugh it's the dr. Lipp original
nipple bong full lips idea and say it
with a straight face but I guess this
was something that nursing mothers used
to use but it's apparently really really
great for anything that needs moisture
so they talked about like your elbows
your lips your skin you know whatever
your cuticles so I actually am really
excited to use it's a hundred percent
natural it's hypoallergenic etc so this
one the full size of this is 1450 of
course this is just a little trial size
so I actually want to open this because
I want to know what it feels like
because it says it's basically like a
cult classic amongst a lot of makeup
artists especially in London it said so
I'm curious to know if it's ever going
to come out as it's just full of a are
you kidding me okay sorry I've got an
attitude today listen to me whoa it
feels like it's like thicker then it
doesn't really have a smell it's like
thicker than petroleum jelly I gotta
show you another little clip it snippet
you know I'm saying I can get it out
look at I'm squeezing as hard as I can
okay can you guys see that probably not
it's right there it's like it's like um
nice porn is this neosporin I don't know
I don't know I guess we'll see I mean
obviously I'm gonna give it a try and
see how I like it but it's interesting
it is interesting but I guess if you got
really really dry lips that probably
would be awesome so she's like an
overnight treatment type of thing uh I
got it my hair hey you guys like my
shirt Minnie Mouse I'm also wearing yoga
pants what else is new but um this one
was one I think I got from Target like
on crazy clearance and every time I
where'd everyone psych you'll a
twelve-year-old him like good it's half
my age perfect more than last thing what
anyway okay so the next thing it came
with was this one hundred percent pure
fruit pigmented natural mascara I when I
first saw this I thought it was lip lip
balm or something doesn't it look like
it be lip balm but I don't want to open
it I want to look at the one but I don't
want to because I don't want to have
another mascara open another one so this
one the original price of this 4 full
sizes $18 so I'm excited to give this a
try someday down the road what I finally
get around to it because I got a lot of
mascaras to try out the next thing it
came with was this I'm actually really
excited about this this might be one of
the coolest products I've ever ever ever
heard of this is from the brand Ruby
wing and it's this nail polish and oh
how pretty it's so cold it's so pretty
well guess what happens this is what it
looks like like inside apparently now I
haven't tried this out so I don't know
how well it works but I can't wait to
this is what it looks like inside just
as pretty goal you go outside and
apparently it turns into this like berry
red like Ruby slipper type color in like
the sunlight or the daylight or whatever
what so it says there's a picture on
here I don't know it's as inside and
outside so that color right there is
what it would look like on the outside
it's in the shea what's it called ride
em cowgirl I'm really excited to try
this because that is like the coolest
thing in the summer how cool would that
be I love it so I'm really excited about
that in the
full-size for this is ten dollars i'm
assuming this is not the full size but
so I mean nail polish come on you ever
used up a whole nail polish maybe ok the
next thing it came with was this surge
normal I have no idea I don't know if
you can even see it it's this dry
conditioner what is that was exactly my
reaction too it's like dry condition
really talking about so I'm thinking oh
maybe it's just a dry shampoo there's
Colin energy I couldn't you know I don't
know so turns out what does it say it
says it's a hydrating mist that adds
instant softness and shine two strands
no running water required so basically
it says you spritz it onto your hair
from like here down you avoid the roots
because it is conditioning so you do it
from here down especially down here and
it says it's a really great thing to do
after dry shampoo so once you kind of
dry shampoo it up here you dry condition
down here interesting right this is you
know what those days when you don't
shower and wash your hair you don't wash
your hair i should say are becoming more
work than just getting in the shower and
washing your hair you know it's so funny
but um i'm interested to try this I've
never heard of a dry conditioner so it's
pretty exciting and the full size of
this is $25 so so the lifestyle extra I
was talking to my friend kirsten from
its kirsten here on youtube and I was
telling her that I was going to fill
with birchbox unboxing and I was like
why these lifestyle extras why like I
signed up for a makeup subscription box
because I want makeup not this which is
T you can it's just so funny to me and I
get it you know it's fun to have
something different i'm sure a lot of
you guys like that i'm not saying
obviously i like t it a lot I drink tea
every single dick but it just made me
laugh some like seriously come on come
on I'd rather have a lip balm or
something but it comes with three
different teas this is Jasmine green tea
and then blackcurrant bliss oberst I
mean and Earl Grey these are both black
teas which I'm not a huge fan of bhakti
but I love green tea and it's the brand
is a mod tea and it says for a full size
so I'm assuming
box at seven dollars so you know I mean
it's better to get this then not
anything else at all I guess but it just
makes me laugh to be honest I'm just
like come on so I'm kind of interested
to see what next month's lifestyle extra
will be hopefully it will be T again I
mean I'll drink these but it also came
with like a roll of ok talked about how
to earn points on birchbox and it has
this like whole sheet of note cards
they're cute this is go get him tigress
see we yes happy happy happy and be
awesome and it's just got all these
things ways to be happy interesting I
actually was planning on doing a video
on kind of ways to live your life in a
more happy way let me know if you'd be
interested in that because I don't know
I think well obviously we all struggle
with happiness from time to time but um
I don't know lately I've had a lot of
things that I've been doing and
practicing and just ways of thinking and
being in the world that I would love to
share with you guys so if you're
interested let me know down below

obviously that's not makeup related but
it is something that I feel like I've
have a little bit of expertise on these
