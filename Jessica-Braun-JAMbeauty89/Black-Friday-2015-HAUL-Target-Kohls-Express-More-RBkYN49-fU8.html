gonna be bringing you a Black Friday
haul so we and by we I mean my husband
and I went Black Friday shopping and
we've logged in the entire time I will
link the blog right up there as well as
down below if you're interested in
seeing kind of the behind the scenes of
when I was buying all of this stuff but
other than that let's go ahead and get
into the hall so I have I think it's
like five or six different stores we
started at Target I have two different
bags from Target to share with you guys
the first thing all of their clothing
and like women's clothing accessories
etc I think was like everything except
for like undergarments and socks
we're 42 soft so this shirt first caught
my eye it is so so cute and it's kind of
like a fitted sweater which I love and
in the store it looked red but it really
is kind of more of an orange but I love
that I had the navy blue and white plaid
on it and that the sleeves were just
that plain color and it's pretty soft so
I was so excited to find this all of
these this plaid I got a lot of plaid
and of course I already own a lot of
plaid I love it and it makes me like the
90s and like home alone Christmas time
which is like my favorite which is a lot
of our favorite I think that's why we
all love it so much but I was very
excited about that fine there and a lot
of this stuff these were things that
I've been eyeing at Target for a while
anyway and then when it was 40% off I
was like I'm if I'm ever gonna do it now
is the time so this next one I used to
have a shirt like this that I wore but
it was a little large on me and then I
when I washed it once it like shrunk
really oddly so I got rid of it but it's
just a plain white denim shirt a
button-up and I love the sleeves how you
can kind of roll them up that way it's
just a really kind of loose-fitting but
not too loose you know there's kind of a
fine line but it's really comfortable
and it's a really soft denim where I
feel like the one I had before wasn't
quite as soft so I was really really
excited about this one right here and
then one that I've been
I mean for a long time at Target was
this plaid shirt and again it's a
button-up but it's green and black and I
love it so much I have a black and white
kind of similar to this plaid I have a
black and white plaid shirt that I got
there a couple weeks ago that I love
that I wear like all the time I was like
I need more so I found this one I was so
excited this one's different cuz it
buttons up all the way down whereas the
black and white one I have only buttons
like three or four down and then the
rest is just a shirt you know so I was
very excited again it's so soft it's not
like a thick thick flannel it's kind of
thinner and just really soft so I like
that that way you're not like I don't
know I feel like I sweat too much if
it's any thicker the next shirt I got I
haven't seen it target yet and this is
one that I figured for just going out
would be really cute it's just a tank
top but it's a little bit closer in
around the neck and then it's just got
this like metallic threading throughout
that makes it look really just fun and
comfortable - it's not form-fitting at
all I feel like this would be cute on
its own when it's warmer out but it
would also be really cute under a
cardigan with a cute statement necklace
or without the statement necklace it's
just a really pretty piece and I really
like that it's got this silver exposed
zipper on the back I think I just like
that
a lot so I was excited I feel like I
don't have very many like dressy tanks
that I could wear under something and oh
this would be really cute with the
Blazer - or kimono there's a million
things you can wear with so love that
and oh another thing I got was this is
kind of mourning you guys this is just a
black long-sleeve t-shirt I got it in
its crew neck because I bought a fur
vest recently if you saw in one of my
recent videos in my vlog where I talked
about it I am trying to figure out what
looks good with it and I knew that I
really wanted it just a plain black
long-sleeve shirt so this was like a
couple dollars it's like perfect so
that's what that is for I also got this
their jewelry is also 40% off and I
found this piece that's like this black
almost like drusy stone but with the
gold and it is actually like semi-fitted
I feel like a lot of bangles that I get
are really really big and this is a
stretchy one
but are really really big and they end
up like going all the way to here and
that drives me bonkers so this one
actually like stays you know that's like
a radius all except that it'll fall down
but this one it's perfect so I love it
so much this was originally $12.99 so it
ended up being under $10 for sure oh
these were like three four five I only
got one pair though these are these like
heather gray like really light grey
plain gloves but what I loved about them
is that their touch screen compatible so
you know they look like really simple
gloves and these are so good I have lots
of cutesy gloves but these are so
practical for all the traveling we do I
need a really packable pair of gloves
that are touch screen compatible that
would match anything and these are
perfect so kind of thinking I should
have gotten more than one pair just like
when these wear out but I would figure
Target will probably sell gloves like
this for ever and then the last thing I
got at Target is this novel and it's
called Z and it's a novel of Zelda
Fitzgerald who is the wife of F scott
Fitzgerald who wrote like the Great
Gatsby and they were really big and like
the writers group of friends back in the
20s and so I've heard really good things
about this book and of course it was a
New York Times bestseller although
there's so many books that are New York
Times bestsellers but I was really
excited so I'm excited to read this book
moving on the next place we stopped was
cool and they had some pretty good deals
but as I walked through it you can see
it in the blog I kind of felt like it
was just a lot of the same thing and I
already had bought enough plaid like at
Target and also what I own so I was like
ok there's a lot of fad there what's
your so cute but I didn't really need
anymore so the one thing I loved was
again this kind of heather gray colored
sweater but it was actually kind of
fitted you see that so I really really
liked that and I loved that had just a
little bit of design to it where there's
a little bit of a difference in the
texture in the middle versus the outside
so my biggest complaint the sweaters is
that they never not never but a lot of
them never look I just said it again a
lot of them don't look flattering on
like anyone and they're just so boxy and
then you just feel uncomfortable or
they're too thick but all the things I
found were very again like kind of
flexible and thinner
and this one's a little bit thinner too
but it's still going to be warm so I
loved this and I love this color it
really is the same color as these gloves
like I think it's so pretty
and that one was the doorbuster do it
was like $10 but they have a lot of
different colors I had my eye on there
was like a wine colored one that was
really really pretty too I also got this
pair of champion socks I go through
running socks
I wear them out to be frank and these
are usually get Nike ones but they're
really really expensive but they're
really nice but with our puppy he keeps
running away with my socks and chewing
them up before I catch him with it so
I'm like okay these Nike socks are too
expensive to be going through like that
so I found these ones by champion and
they're gray and black and I love color
but for me I just like to have really
boring gym socks like gray and black
only white ones show dirt too easily and
it kind of grosses me out and the bright
ones I don't know like it clashes with
my shoes and I know that sounds kind of
dumb but that's just the way I feel so
I'm really boring with my gym socks but
these felt really well made and there's
like a reinforced ankle and heel area
which I really liked so was very excited
about that and I got six pairs for the
price of like two or three pairs of Nike
ones so and then the last thing I got at
Kohl's was this pair of golden hoops it
was by the it says the ear edit but I
think it was under the apartment nine
umbrella I don't know like that brand
but I loved how thin these were and I I
always have a pair of silver and gold
hoops because I travel with them and I
like usually bring like one pair of
studs and that's it because they work
with anything but I had recently lost
one of my two golden hoops and I love
the big just really thin ones cuz again
they just look really nice and put
together but a little edgy but not
really I just love them so I was very
excited about that fine the next stop
was Express and they had their entire
store 50% off and I was like oh my gosh
because I love Express's clothes that
they're really overpriced for what they
are and even when you find them on sale
it's not always very reasonable still so
the first thing I got was again another
kind of going out top that you could
layer under a blazer which is this tank
top I loved it and here's the thing you
guys I mean you're learning about
you got obsessed with like the 1920s
this made me think of like art deco so
kind of the same and I just I loved the
shapes I loved them as gold and a little
bit of silver and then just it's plain
on the back and it's kind of like a
halter and it looks it feels really
comfortable it feels decently well made
for what it is I mean this isn't
something that I'm gonna wear all the
time that I'm gonna really wear it out
and of course I'll have to watch it on
the delicate cycle because that's the
one downside but I was very excited
about this fine and I think it ended up
being about yeah about 14 bucks so I was
like that's not bad for a shirt that
it's so pretty it's so pretty and the
other thing I got at Express were these
pleather jeggings or well no I guess
you'd call money leggings jeggings would
only be up there jean ones and these
were still over $20 but I was like you
know what I've been wanting a pair like
this forever because they're so pretty
under like tunics and things with boots
and I don't know I just always wanted
some and these actually feel like the
inside is like just Paul yet or I don't
even know what this would be called but
just a really stretchy comfortable
material on the inside because that's
the thing when I always look at them I'm
like those look uncomfortable but these
actually feel like they would be
comfortable and they're just fitted all
the way down and I am so excited to wear
these with all kinds of things because
you can dress these up and down they're
awesome
the next place we went was was an
American Eagle Aeropostale air possum
and I found this coat and it was this
was the priciest thing I bought this was
originally $100 and it was 60% off so it
was 40 but I was like okay for a really
nice coat it's not as well-made it's
like one you're gonna spend $400 for
like at a department store I know that
and it's evident but it's one of those
cute coats that I was looking for one to
take with me to London and I know if
you're annoyed about me talking about
I'm trying not to talk about I'm just
excited about it um but it it's crazy
fitted and it's like the most fitted
jacket I've ever had but it's got these
cute toggle buttons here and but it also
zips so the toggle buttons are kind of
for decoration but you also actually can
use them but the main thing is the
zipper all the way up and it kind of
flavor
at the bottom it has a hood which that
it's so hard to find a cute jacket
especially like a pea coat that's
actually kind of thicker like this with
a hood because it's going to rain I am
sure a decent amount but it's got really
nice pockets and I was so excited about
this so if they ever have a sale like
that again you guys have got a look at
their coats and of course Bethany Mota
has aligned now this isn't from her line
she had a lot of cute coats there too so
definitely something worth checking out
because the air box was not a place I
would think to go for coats but I was
very impressed and the last thing I'll
share with you is something from the
Disney Store I love Disney if you didn't
know that about me and we go to Disney
World like once a year sometimes twice
sometimes thrice no I don't think we've
ever around three times a year I wish
but our dog is named Pinocchio
and so it's our first year having him I
mean we got him in Jo August I think I
don't know when but um this is a little
Pinocchio ornament we found at the
Disney Store so we were like you know
what that's perfect because my mom
actually got us that little like puppies
first Christmas or whatever kind of
ornament so cute we could put a picture
of him as a puppy but this was just one
that we wanted to buy for ourselves as
well just because first of all it's
Disney but also just Pinocchio even
though it's not a puppy but he's kind of
standing like a puppy there so that is
everything that I bought this past Black
Friday I would love to know what deals
you scored and if you've got a video
about this or anything like that even
blog post let me know down below because
I love seeing what else is out there and
the nice thing about Black Friday deals
is even if you can't get the same deal
you can at least see like especially
with the target and cold stuff those
things are still there so it's not that
you can't get them it just might be they
might be a couple dollars more so I love
seeing this stuff other than that I hope
that you enjoyed this video and if you
did please subscribe and I'll catch you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
