going to be sharing with you some of my
favorite Black Friday makeup and beauty
deals at Ulta and Sephora I am
specifically looking at what they're
offering and kind of curating and
picking out the things that I tried that
I know I really love that way you can
have a good idea that if you're gonna
buy it is gonna be something that is
worthwhile it's worth the money and if
you're gonna give it as a gift to
someone it's something that they will
most likely really really like so
without further ado let's go ahead and
get into it now I want to mention
something that I used before I online
shop anywhere and before you think this
is sponsored it's not sponsored in any
way at all I use Ebates
every single time and when I first heard
of a makes a couple years ago and I've
actually I have worked with them in the
past but this one not they don't even
know that I'm doing this video I was
kind of skeptical because Ebates just
sounds like a sketchy online scam I
don't know why it just does the name I
don't think is a great name regardless
what you do is basically you go to the
site you make an account and then every
time you're gonna online shop you go to
Ebates first you search for like
whatever online retailers so Sephora
Victoria's Secret Nordstrom whatever
they have almost everything and there's
a certain percent cashback every single
day sometimes it'll change especially
during like Cyber Monday Black Friday
it'll usually be higher percentages so
I'll search for Sephora
Ebates and then I'll click Sephora on
there it'll take me in a separate window
to sabores website and then I can shop
and stuff take forever whatever and then
when I check out it will automatically
apply to my Ebates account so if Sephora
were like 10 percent cashback that day
if I'm spending $100 which is very
likely when I'm placing a sport order
I'm getting $10 back in my bank account
and it's as simple as that it's not
sketchy I've been doing this for a
couple years now and
every time especially at this time of
year I've made like a couple hundred
dollars back just from doing cash back
because I'm buying a lot of my gifts
online
so anyway Sephora and Ulta do their
Black Friday deals differently sephora's
main thing is that they have these ten
dollar deals Ulta just has just lots of
really good sales so they're all
different prices and all the info is
linked and listed below in the order I
mention them I've got my little curated
list here let's start with Sephora
because the ten dollar deals I think are
some of the best online the first one
I'm going to mention is this Tarte easy
glowing deluxe cheek set now it looks
like this comes with a blush and a stick
blush I have owned many Tarte blushes
and their stick blushes both of them
stay on all day inferred like the stick
blush for a creamy cheek product which I
don't really love cream blushes but they
actually it's actually stays put and I
was very surprised with the way that
they wear these look like more kind of
bronze II Chloe shades and I think you
can actually even pair them together a
lot of people will use a cream product
and then they'll put the powder on top
of it just to make it last even longer
so this would be a great set their
blushes are typically and I don't know I
can't tell in the picture if that's a
full size or not but the full-sized
Tarte blushes are like 20 I want to say
like 26 dollars something like that so
they are not cheap so to get this set
even if it is a mini with the stick for
ten bucks is a really good deal because
that blush you're not gonna go through
anytime soon it's a gift that anyone
that would receive this would love it I
mean there's there's such high quality
the next product I'm gonna mention is
this first a beauty kit it's called
they're so long dry now first date
Beauty the only things I've tried from
them are their cleanser the cleanser
they have I just said cleanser really
weird cleanser the cleanser is really
really nice it's rated pretty well on
the Beauty pedia site that I always talk
about where I was check out like what
skin care is actually good for you and
what skin care is really not this one
comes with their ultra Repair instant
oatmeal mask and their intense hydration
skin protector it's their ultra Repair
Cream
so people that love this stuff love the
ultra Repair Cream I've never tried
these particular product
but I'm mentioning it because I know
first a beauty really does have some
great products so it's worth trying
especially for ten dollars for yourself
if you're wanting to branch out with
skincare but it's also a great gift for
people that you know really take care of
their skin or want to take care of their
skin this next one I mentioning for ten
dollars is one of my favorite deals that
they have at all this is the Too Faced
sexy lips and lashes and it comes with
two products and they're both deluxe
sizes it comes with the Too Faced better
than sex mascara and the shadow
insurance I'm looking at the picture on
my phone in case you are curious of why
I keep looking down
they're both great products the better
than sex mascara is really really nice
it gives you very like velvety kind of
plush lashes it's not the best muster
I've ever used by any means but it is
one of the ones that I do like and it
just very feathery and then the shadow
insurance is a great eye primer that
small size lasts a surprisingly long
time and frankly the deluxe size of the
mascara lasts just about as long as a
regular tube of mascara anyway at least
in my experience they have so I think
that is an awesome way to try two new
products if you know you've got someone
that's just a beauty junkie they will
love those and again a lot of these are
sized so they're they're truly stocking
stuffers because most of them are really
small sizes and they're so cute that
they're great stocking stuffers as well
the next thing I want to mention is the
buxom strut your stuff set and this
comes with three pieces it comes with
one of their lip glosses which I love
they're usually very tingly and they're
just beautiful on the lips and then it
also has it looks like one of these lip
pencils which I've never tried and an
eye liner so I've never tried the other
two but I know for the lip gloss alone
they're amazing and again that lip gloss
lasts a surprising amount of time I had
a baby one that lasts me quite a while
so I love buxom lip products I would
have to assume the rest are good but
I've never tried them the next thing I
mention is this living proof set now I
have tried when I wear my hair naturally
curly I use the living proof like curl
line at least that's what I've been
using lately and I really do like that
it's kind of expensive so for this set
to be ten dollars for three different
products
that's awesome now this isn't pectorals
this is their perfect hair day line I've
tried the perfect hair day dry shampoo
and it's great I have not tried these
but I wanted to mention this one because
I have heard amazing things about the
perfect hair day line and this comes
with the styling treatment which is one
of the products I've heard people really
really like so I I did I want to buy
this kit to be honest with you because I
want to try all these it has a shampoo
and conditioner as well
so definitely and I'm assuming their
trial size which really that's kind of
perfect because a you can travel with
them if you're traveling for the
holidays but it's another great gift set
as well
the next thing I'm gonna mention is this
Tarte set with three pieces called their
fanciful favorites Deluxe discovery set
and it has another one in there blushes
that I talked about it has the Mary Kuja
which people love on their skin you can
kind of use it as a serum you can kind
of people will mix it with that I mean
you can do so much with their maracuja
I've even heard people putting in their
hair and then the lights camera lashes
mascara that one's a nice one it's not
my favorite but honestly again for the
blush and the oil alone I think it'd be
worth the $10 the mascara is kind of an
added bonus this is a great one for a
beauty lover or for you if you've been
wanting to branch out into the higher
end of things but you're not sure where
to start that's a great kit to start
with this next one mention another
absolute favorite of this whole
collection is the Urban Decay triple
threat travel pencil set and it's smoky
matte so it looks like there's like a
brown a lot it looks like a navy blue
and a black I love there are twenty
four-seven liners there and that's what
these are they are so creamy but then
they don't move and I feel like a lot of
creamy liners I've tried they end up
smudging throughout the day these are
creamy to apply but then once they set
after like 30 seconds they are not
budging I actually use it today just
like the black 24/7 to tightline my eyes
I ended up putting I always put gel
liner on top of it anyway but it's so
creamy and easy to get right between
your lashes you know I love it I think
that is an amazing deal they're not the
full size there's still some
but again they last a decent amount of
time and to get three different shades I
think that is awesome
the next thing I'm gonna mention is by
Smashbox not Smashbox not let's check a
box the next one is by Smashbox and it's
a two piece set called there art love
color primer pair now I've only tried
one of these - I've tried the photo
finish primer I love it it's at least
the one I've tried assuming this is the
same one it looks like it is kind of
more silicone base so it's almost
velvety to the touch but it does a great
job of filling in your pores and holding
on to foundation so it stays in place
all day the other piece of it is the
primer water which I've heard great
things about in fact I'm planning on
ordering because I've heard such amazing
things about it from what I've heard
it's got like caffeine in the spray so
it's just really good at waking up your
skin I don't know how true that is but
I'm just dying to try it so I might wait
and get this set but I haven't quite
decided in the last thing I mentioned
from the Sephora $10 deals and again
there are more deals but these were the
best in my opinion is this Jack Black
duo now this is typically for men and
that's why I'm including it because this
is an awesome for really any guy because
even the most macho of guys they should
be moisturizing their face they should
moisturize it especially if they're
trying to kiss your lips but it comes
with their lip balm which is really
famous and I've even used that I really
like it so it doesn't have to be for men
and then it's got this facial
moisturizer again could be for a man or
women it doesn't really matter I just
know that Tyler my husband really likes
the Jack Black line and I always get him
kind of something from Jack Black for
Christmas almost every year so I
probably will get this set for him but
it's called the comfort enjoy - I don't
know if I said that so I know a lot of
these for both Sephora and Ulta are I
think every single thing is available
online but only some of the deals are
available in stores so you might have
better luck just staying in staying cozy
inside and ordering it online rather
than going out because not all of these
deals some of them are online only is
what I'm trying to say so let's go into
the Ulta one now the older one I know
for sure starts on Thursday as in
Thanksgiving at 5 p.m. it's getting
earlier and earlier you guys it's hardly
Black Friday if it starts on Thursday
but that's all a mess anyway I don't
know I couldn't find anywhere exactly
what time
Sephora one starts I don't know if it
starts like midnight or what if I find
out anytime between now and when I put
this video up I can edit the description
box so you can see the time but I know
for sure also starts at 5:00 p.m. on
Thursday so I picked out these aren't
ten dollar deals these are all different
prices so I'll tell you the prices I go
through them there are a few good men
gifts on here as well but then a lot of
awesome goodies so the first thing I'm
gonna mention I'm probably going to be
ordering on Black Friday and it is this
sebastien hairspray deal they're
typically 1895 for a full sized and
Sebastian hair sprays are some of my
favorites but they're so expensive
I never splurge on them ever it's too
much for a hairspray unless it's like a
miracle worker which this is close
anyway it is 795 on Black Friday so I
might order two but I love all I've
tried I think every single one and
they're all really good I can't even
pick a favorite but they have like you
know some four different hair types etc
different hold so just think about what
you like
they always smell pretty decent and they
just work really well I think the
Sebastian shaper zero gravity is the one
I really like for like a few years like
a tousle touchable hold that's a great
one for that but they're all really good
and 795 I am so excited this next one
I'm going to mention is one of my
favorites and so I don't need to buy it
because I own it they're doing a 50% off
a benefit I shadow and lip deal and
according to what it says it says all
benefit I in live I don't know
but looking at the picture they provided
with it the first thing that came to
mind was their creaseless cream shadow
and my favorite shade is RSVP in fact
let me grab it so you can see it now you
guys know I'm very picky about what
stays in my collection I get a lot every
single month whether I'm hauling it for
videos or whether companies are sending
it to me and I'm very picky about what
stays i declutter like every month in
fact I'm the declutter video I think I
just put up this has stayed in my
collection I love it I actually just got
it this year it's this beautiful cream
shadow that's just like this I love it
so much it's so shimmery and wonderful
and it stays put all day they have other
shades as well but this is the one
that's like the standout one for me so
I definitely recommend that and 50% off
of this is awesome because I want to say
this is around like 20 dollars should be
10 which that's not too far above like
the Maybelline Color tattoo so they'll
be a great way for you to try one of
these or give it as a gift to anyone
else the benefit lip products I haven't
really tried much out to be honest I
know they have like the posy tint like
lip balm posy balm and all those
different things I haven't tried a lot
of those but I know I love the cream
shadows okay the next one is from Too
Faced and I really really like this set
I think more than the ones at Sephora I
can't I can't really decide but this
one's a little more expensive this one
is a 16 dollar set but you get three
different things you get a melted
lipstick you get the better than sex
mascara but then you also get there I'm
assuming it's there it's one of their
bronzers I can't tell and it doesn't say
exactly what bronzer it is but all the
Broncos are really really nice so I
think that's an awesome deal the melted
lipsticks I'm assuming it's deluxe sized
but that lasts forever
what you just don't run out of that and
the melted liquid lipsticks are
beautiful they're high color high
pigmentation but they're really really
pretty and they're comfortable on the
lips so I think that's a pretty darn
good deal whether it's for yourself or
for a gift the next thing is this $10
deal for it cosmetics brushes now this
is a line they created for Ulta I've
never tried them but I've tried a lot of
it cosmetics brushes and their every
single one is the most amazing brush
I've ever tried they are so unbelievably
soft but they also actually work well I
feel like sometimes the brush can be so
soft and you're like wow this must be
nice but then it doesn't actually blend
well or it doesn't you know apply maybe
something liquid very well or something
powder these everyone I've ever tried
I've tried face brushes I brush as they
are all incredible incredible so I've
never tried the Ulta line of them but I
would have to assume they've gotta at
least be on the same caliber for ten
dollars to get three and it looks like
they're shorter ones which I mean that
isn't really around
I don't think I've ever cared about the
length of it but I think that is an
awesome deal that might be one that I
pick up as well just because I think it
is awesome the next two I'm gonna
mention are for men this first one is a
set from Clinique and it's their
Clinique for men essentials kits and it
looks like maybe there you have a couple
of options of kits it doesn't exactly
say but they're 1950 each if you know
you've got a husband boyfriend whatever
maybe a dad I don't know that is wanting
to take care of their skin better or
maybe they just like it I think this is
pretty cool I've never tried it but this
is something I'm thinking about getting
mr. Braun so um
not not mine not my father-in-law my
husband did you get that anyway I think
I mean it's $20 so it's a little pricier
compared to all the other deals we
talked about but if you know that's the
perfect kind of a gift for someone it
might be worth it for the most part
Clinique skin care across the board gets
pretty good ratings I haven't looked
this set up specifically but okay the
next one for men I'm gonna mention is
from Jack Black and that's the same
brand I mentioned from Sephora this
one's $12 but it comes to three things
instead of two the other one only had
two this one has the beard Lube so if
you like Tyler right now has a beard and
he always grows at November but then it
just stays throughout anyways so it's
beard loose so it's good I think it's
like moisturizing for their beard I
think he might have this actually but
then it also has that same face
moisturizer and the lip balm so this
just has one extra product the beard
lube but it's only two dollars more so
that's really a better deal than this
for one in my opinion but if your
husband boyfriend whatever it doesn't
have a beard then that wouldn't make
sense the other kid makes more sense so
I had to mention that the next thing is
a $19 deal and it's a three piece set
from Tarte called the Tarte legendary
lips and lashes set and it comes with
those like camera lashes lights camera
lashes mascara that same one from the
other kit but it also has one of their
Tarte lip balm stains those are really
nice they're really minty I'm not a big
fan of balm sayings to be honest I used
to have a bunch of I got rid of because
I just never warm but if you know
someone does or
they're younger or they like more of a
washed out look on your lips washed out
sounds negative I don't mean that in a
negative way just see more of like a
lighter coverage then they would love
that because they really are a nice
formula and they feel really awesome on
the lips but it also comes with one of
their liquid black liners I haven't
tried it I've heard they're really
really nice I don't know it looks nice
and I like the way that it's thin so if
you like if you know someone that does
winged liner that'd be a great gift for
them or for yourself if you're wanting
to those kinds of brushes are really
good at getting a winged liner so much
more perfect than probably usual at
least that's the case for me oh the next
deal is the benefit majorette blush it's
ten dollars now I don't own this I've
tried to have swatched it in store it's
more of like a creamy blush and it's a
peachy shade it's the cutest packaging
and if you know someone that likes cream
blushes or just blush in general they
probably really like this it looks like
a little drum you know like have a new
six trombones but it's so cute I'm
thinking about buying for myself
although I know I don't need it but I
think that's a great deals regular
twenty eight dollars so ten dollars
twenty eight that's pretty awesome
so those are all the Ulta deals I pulled
out again there are more so I will link
the Black Friday site for both Ulta and
Sephora down below because there are
more deals than what I mentioned I just
picked my favorites I also wanted to
mention that Urban Decay's website is
20% off site-wide on Black Friday
Birchbox if you buy anything from their
online shop which I do all the time
because they carry so many brands you
get 30% off if you're in Birchbox ace
and if you're not you can get 25% off
the promo codes for those are below
Anasazi of Beverly Hills is 25% off all
brow products I really like their brow
is a lot of people like their dip brow
pomade I'm not really big on brow pomade
but for their amazing I like their clear
brow gel and 25% off is actually a
pretty big chunk because their products
are expensive for what it is if I learn
about any other beauty deals that I
didn't mention out loud again I'll kind
of have a list below there are tons of
websites out there with lots of compiled
lists but I'm trying to narrow it down
for you guys because I think it's really
overwhelming to be honest so hopefully
you found this video helpful if you are
interested in
my drugstore makeup hauls and reviews
and other things that's really what my
channels focused on here I can link my
playlist below with my most recent ones
and I hope that you'll subscribe and
