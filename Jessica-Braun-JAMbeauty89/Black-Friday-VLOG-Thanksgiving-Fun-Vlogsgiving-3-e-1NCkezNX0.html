I always look so awesome at the
beginning being sarcastic I always look
crazy so right now I'm sitting at our
kitchen table here and uploading the
next vlogs giving and I decided to add
day-in-the-life to the title because
I've that's the kind of video I watch I
realize I'm like that's kind of what
we're doing here so that way people kind
of know what they're getting with it
because people vlog in so many different
ways it's amazing anyway I am eating
oatmeal out of a Rubbermaid like
Tupperware type container because all of
our bowls are dirty in the dishwasher is
going so that's what I'm using but I
used coconut sugar today we'd bought
we've had it for a while on buy two
cautious on a whim because we're like
I'm gonna try that it's actually really
good I usually use like a little bit of
brown sugar but I just kind of
substituted coconut sugar and then
there's obviously blueberries in it but
I love old fashioned oatmeal like on the
stove I just love it anyway
so that is what I'm up to this morning
Tyler actually has a much shorter day
because it's the day before Thanksgiving
so he is gonna be back for lunch and
then he'll be back a couple hours early
but I need to go to the grocery store
today during the day because by the time
people get off of work the day before
Thanksgiving the store is gonna be crazy
and we still need to get stuff for punch
for my my side of the family's
Thanksgiving
Pinnochio get out of there buddy and
just a couple of other things so it's
gonna be an interesting day here but I
know I'm not gonna film it all today so
that kind of frees up a couple quite a
few hours of time which is good what can
I do to get you out of my bed so that it
doesn't smell like feet cuz your paws
smell like feet and Cheetos but you're
so cute okay so we are currently driving
at about five miles an hour behind a
like construction
thing I'm trying to go to the grocery
store to get some other Thanksgiving
things that we need but also even like
get some holiday shopping done so I'm
really excited to do that and we're
celebrating Thanksgiving with our
separate sides of the families on
different days which is a great thing
because then we can really spend time
with both sides of our family so it
worked out really well but we're also
celebrating my father-in-law time
there's dad's birthday on Sunday so
making sure we've got the gift for him
done and tonight when Tyler gets off of
work we're going to order a pizza and
just like chill and wrap some gifts and
it's gonna be awesome so I'm really
looking forward to my the only person
that feels ridiculously happy when I see
Christmas okay so I am all done all
kinds of things I also forgot I had to
get a gift for my new nieces baptism so
that was exciting so I got something for
her it's my sister's a little baby girl
it's exciting and that is happening for
us on Saturday so there's a lot this
weekend well exciting well so am I the
only one that listens to classical radio
stations anyway I think wasn't do it
every time I'm in the car I'm like the
weirdest 26 year old you've ever met and
it's the matted one so even if like
stuff gets on it so it looks cool
accessories are fallen so we're gonna
I'm gonna make a cheese cake tonight and
then we're gonna do some chocolate
cookies soon another cheesecake for my
family this weekend two cheesecakes
coming up lots of cheese spots it's like
to go with girls in here you're welcome
love you so much so we've got our little
Christmas lights also look at the moon I
know yeah it's not showing nearly but
it's like orange but then it's like I'm
covered really
good morning happy Thanksgiving morning
Happy Thanksgiving
oh I wasn't saying it to you no Marty
said it to you a lot anyway so these
robes if you didn't know Tyler made for
us what was it a couple Christmases ago
and they have our name
oh he's losing his mind who are you
doing but he thinks he's a raptor ever
since we watched Jurassic Park last
night our Jurassic world mean crazy boy
anyway made these for us and they even
say like our name they got a little
Mickey heads on the sleeve anyway we
always I wear them a lot I wear mine a
lot but we were on holidays my favorite
dancer it's a holiday I only bring out
those moves oh okay so I am we had a bet
and I lost so I have to go to the store
to get the newspaper because we don't
like subscribe to it cuz we don't have
time to read it very good anyway but um
to get the ads for Black Friday so I'm
gonna go to the store and I need to get
stuff for corn casserole cuz turns out
I'll make it a quart casserole now - so
your casserole is the bomb my mama's
really a make up list on my way to the
store luckily the stories are all like
one minute from our apartment when we
have a lot of stores around so it works
out I'm deciding I might go
I don't want to go to the store called
Meijer cuz it's the big grocery store
it's my favorite but I figure it'll be
crazy so I'm thinking maybe I could go
to Target but I don't know where they
sell the newspapers at Target or if they
sell newspapers and that is mission
number one for this trip so we're gonna
see I think I'm gonna go to Meijer I'm
so nervous
I've been once before on Thanksgiving
morning to the grocery store and the
lines were so unbelievably long I swore
then and there that I would never do
this again
Here I am oh my gosh I'm like nervous I
got butterflies oh I was in and out very
quickly that was awesome I think because
I got out I mean I don't know now it's 9
o'clock in the morning but I think
because I got there earlier that made a
difference I'm not going back later to
find out but that was awesome so and I
was able to find the newspaper and it is
like this thick with ads I'm like it's a
good thing we recycle think about all
the other newspapers across the nation
that have that many ads in them if not
more and they're not going to be
recycled that kind of I'm Tyler what do
we have going on
I love Al Roker I love them
doing breakfast sandwiches you have to
try them yes they're pretty good they
are very good and my brother who lives
in San Diego was the one that introduced
me to them when I went out there cuz
he's like Oh mimosa so you gotta like
right
he drank them like every day though I'm
like me somebody sailor it's expected I
think it's part of his training I think
for same way he sure didn't he's crazy
this morning he also ate coal which is
what we're cleaning up there oh yeah
yeah so I was lighting the fire and I
kind of swept some of the old stuff out
and then I walked away and I came back
and he had something on the floor I
thought oh it's just a stick and I
looked at it no piece of coal just
cheering on a piece of coal we know what
he's getting for Christmas that's right
christmas came early
so this is my Thanksgiving outfit for
today I've just got a black dress that I
think I'm sure I got it like Marshalls
or somewhere it's I'm realizing from the
front it just looks like a blob but I
guess I could belt it but I don't love
the look of a belt with like a statement
necklace and I definitely want to wear
this necklace then I've got my boots on
and then just some black tights I got it
cold so I'm excited I might put some
little like gold studs in or something
and you know take my hair tie off my
wrist but I'm excited we're about to go
and the corn casserole is done and it
turned out okay and we're gonna bring
our newspaper with ads because my
sisters and I like to look at the ads
you know you know our sisters alright so
we are glammed up glammed up gong clamp
- that's like glamorous camping yeah we
are almost to my parents house we're
gonna drop off recyclables cuz there's
no place anywhere near us that has
recyclables so we've got to go to there
spend it down to do so and we've got all
our my car is like full of stuff it's
crazy even the trunk is but I've got a
lot of makeup that my sisters are gonna
go through so they're gonna be excited
anyway
yeah yep lipstick that's like rough it's
Anna oh yeah pretty cool it is actually
pretty nice I have I have already - so
we're leaving my parents house the most
magical time of the year it's although I
think this the target you'll start in
hours ago we're just kind of going we
have nothing in ten o'clock at night
right now yeah just about
yeah and so we're literally just going
to peruse and we're gonna go to a mall
near us as well but we figured target
usually has just good deals on like
seasons of TV shows which we actually
really like to own so we're just going
for fun I want to look at the clothes
cuz I remember a couple years ago when
we went there were a lot of really good
deals yeah one every year
for the past several years that go with
my friend Ben and we've gone out of like
ten o'clock at night and we stayed out
all night
we don't even hardly ever buy anything
we just like going in but Friday
shopping the first year we gone together
just was currently looking for a new
book I like
but you also like novels oh yeah yes
that's so I'm like a witch that's why
Eric Larson is so good cuz he writes
history but in the weaved in genomics so
this is about Hitler's Berlin Eric
Larsen wrote double annoyed City which
is so good the World's Fair in 1893 no
sounds right anyway but I saw this book
called Z and it's about Zelda Fitzgerald
who was the wife of F scott Fitzgerald
and so it was in the roaring 20s and I'm
I just love learning about that time
period but it is a novel and Tyler just
alerted me that they're doing like a
what do you talk like a series a pilot
on visit netplan Amazon Prime trying
anyway they're doing a bunch of them to
let people vote and decide like what
one's gonna be picked up and continue
but I want to read this so I think I'm
for sure gonna get that because for our
plane ride to London I want a book but
I'm also thinking I just picked this up
it's called the Paris architect in 1942
Paris I don't know
this is so exciting though because I
haven't felt excited about reading a
book in a while so
so we're also getting two seasons of
Modern Family fifth and sixth season
when they were like seven bucks 80 bucks
apiece awesome freaking deal because we
have seasons one through three or one
through four
but I love this show it's one of my
all-time favorites it's eleven eleven
drinking some coffee that we brought
mm-hmm Starbucks but we were like we can
save literally like almost ten dollars
by brewing or so the lights in here went
oh oh oh so we are bye
can I get it around to it Kohl's can you
I ca yeah and then there's actually Ulta
behind us but it's not open till the
morning
well anyway so we're gonna go in Kohl's
and see what they have there cuz we
thought this mall we went to is gonna be
open but of course it's not we didn't
look anything out we're just flying by
the seat of our pants but I found some
awesome stuff at Target and I think I'm
just gonna do like a Black Friday haul
video cuz there's a lot of cute clothes
that I got it was all 40% off I was like
yeah I'm gonna need all these things
I've had my eyes I'm so excited so
they've got a lot of deals but there's a
lot of things already have like I have
way too much slide now chapter target
like I can't buy any more plaid but they
have a lot of cute sweater so I do have
a couple in my hand we'll see what I end
up actually buying but they also have
like a fool's cash deal so that's pretty
cool
in lots of thick leggings thermal
language so much to my surprise they've
got Disney like little sets like jewelry
sets they're so cute like some of them
is you're worth melting forward like
Olaf and a snowflake but it's a dormer
it is adorable
this one says I'll be here Mickey if
you'll be mine baby so we were just
walking around and we ran into Libby

12-course than it's ever been but I mean

just here to have fun this is crazy and
we have drink a lot of coffee it's quick
yeah you know our moms are amazing it is
still hot
they have like vacuum insulated mugs
that we've been using for years so we
quickly realized that the line here is
not worth it yeah they had some like
decent like things are like $14 like on
racks but it's nothing that I'm willing
because the problem is yeah and they
don't have they're not like Target in
places where there's like a million
