gonna be doing three different
subscription box and boxing's for the
month of July 2015 and so today I'm
going to be unboxing if see glossy box
in boxycharm now if C is $10 a month
glossy box and boxycharm are both $21 a
month I can have info and links down
below these are all three sent to me for
PR purposes to do with what I please and
I like to unbox them on my channel so
you guys can get a peek at what is in
them each month so let's go ahead and
get into it let's start with epsy cuz
that one seems to be a lot of people's
favorites so it always comes with
products are like in a bag in this
month's bag oh it's actually it's like a
fabric bag it's really cute and it's got
that sort of chevron print to it I
actually really like it
sometimes the bags are kind of wonky
you're not well made at this month I
actually really like so first thing I'm
just gonna grab okay it's a Tarte
bronzer this is their Park Ave princess
waterproof bronzer I think I used to
have this size and then I got a full
size so I gave the sample size to a
sister someone regardless this the
sample size is like might as well be a
full size that's plenty of bronzer it
takes a very long time to go through
which is awesome and this is an
expensive really nice bronzer so that
it's amazing that it came with this and
if you don't know this bronzer it's kind
of like a lighter bronzer and it's got a
little bit of shimmer to it I really
like it
I really do but it does have shimmer so
if you know you don't like that they
sell a matte version of it as well which
is really nice but the shimmery one it
really is pretty okay the next thing in
it is this lip balm it says Jersey Shore
Sun mcgann go nutrient dense anti-aging
lip conditioner says it's got calcium
magnesium copper zinc and it just looks
like it's got a lot of oils got beeswax
sunflower oil so I think this will be
really nice just in the summer time to
branch out and maybe try out a different
lip lip balm or chapstick because I feel
like I'm in a rut and I use the same
ones but I love
so that's why but it's always nice to
try something new all right the next
thing in here is looks like a pencil
like a I'm along assuming an eye pencil
I have no nails right now so it's quite
a challenge to get any of this hook open
so it says jelly pong pong and it's got
beeswax in it as well and it's like a I
pencil I think you could use it as a
liner it's like thicker but you can also
use it as a shadow pencil and it's got
really nice like kind of coppery brown
tone to it I like that the next thing in
here when I first just now looked at I
thought was one of the Revlon ones that
have the little quilted packaging I
don't even know if they still sell that
but it's bellapierre and it's a lipstick
in the shade
inkay ooh this oh this looks like the
lipstick I'm wearing right now maybe
even a little bit brighter but mmm okay
there lipstick smell like vanilla oh and
by the way one of my favorite lip
glosses ever it's called vanilla pink I
think or vanilla sponge cake it's 5 I'll
appear as well.there lip products are
really really nice and they smell really
really good but that's the color it's
really really pigmented I just like that
a lot
ok so the last thing in this bag is this
cool wavy cheese salt spray and it's
like a little deluxe sized shake well
apply to damp or dry hair style with
figures for a beachy wave okay that
never works for my hair because my hair
is naturally curly so it's either gonna
be like pretty straight with a little
bit of wave but not really in a cute way
or it'll be like kind of a curly wavy
that you see but this stuff just makes
my hair really like I mean this type of
stuff not this product salt spray is
always make my hair look ratty but not
in a cute way so I don't really have the
type of hair that works for this but
I'll give it a try so all in all with
that bag for 10 bucks I mean this is
worth 10 bucks alone the Tarte bronzer
but the lipstick is really really nice
and then the other products are nice as
well but those were the two that I'm
really really really excited about
moving on from there
let's do glossy box next again this
one's $21 and it comes with this little
card that tells you what's in it I don't
want to
yeah let's go ahead to see it's so cute
it's just so cute art look presents good
feels like okay alright the first huge
thing in here is this
koishi I don't have to say it if you can
help me out let me know down below anti
cellulite booster
it's a paraben free see what it says
it's got a metric natural complex that
combats existing cellulite while
preventing the formulation of new
cellulite hmm
it also is a local effect on reducing
fat tissue if that's true that would be
awesome I mean we've all got a little
bit to cellulite so there's no shame in
that but anything that would help would
be awesome I've heard and who knows
I've heard that there's no way to get
rid of it just straight up I don't know
if that's true but it certainly would be
worth a try so I'll let you guys know
because if it even works a little bit
that's always nice a little bit helps
you know okay the next thing in here
with another lip balm this one is naked
lips peppermint
it says 99% organic 100% natural what's
in it
sunflower oil coconut oil it's got a lot
of the same things that were in the
other but those are always nice too so
again a great way to throw like in your
beach bag I wonder if this has SPF
although the ones with SPF always dry my
lips out so I don't know I don't think
it does okay the next thing in here it
says hey honey I peel good then cream
creamy honey peel cream it's a lot of
the word cream
it's an exfoliant it does not have a
Ajay's it says it's aaj free apply on to
clean and dry skin massage for two to
three minutes or until the texture is
oily and smooth rinse with water and pat
dry so I'm assuming this is for your
face not like your whole body right so
that's pretty cool I would bet this is a
full size I wonder if it set this is
half the size of the full size so this
for the full size is $59 this anti
cellulite booster by the way is $22 what
else have I already opened this
chapstick it says that that one is five
dollars in 50 Cent's so it's a kind of
still pricey for lip balm but
- Beth okay so the next thing in here is
this pencil it says face Stockholm and
it's a lip liner and it says the shade
is Yvonne whoa that's like a brown
isn't that cool though I don't have one
like that I'll tell you that right now
it's literally like a bronzy brown that
is so cool though it's just a regular
pencil one it's not retractable so it's
not it's decently creamy for a pencil
one I mean that's a tall thing and the
last thing
oh that retails for seventeen dollars
and the last thing in here retails for
twenty-six and it's a cargo blush okay
you need to know that when I was first
getting into makeup and like kind of
dipping my toes in the water if like
some of the more expensive makeup and
saving up to buy some things I wanted
cargo blushes so bad and I never got one
I ended up buying a bronzer once and it
was like way too dark it did not work I
ended up using it although for the most
part anyway so this is not their full
size I don't know if I just said that
it's not usually the blushes are bigger
but again with blush and especially when
you're a collector like I am you're not
going to go through the whole thing so
the shade is let's see if it says it
Coronado
oh I've heard of this shade oh and it's
like a light peach that's like my
favorite it's R okay so it's really
light if you've got deeper skin than I
do it might show up it would almost look
more like a highlight which could be
pretty cuz it looks like it's got kind
of a satin finish to it not shimmer but
just like a satin finish I will
definitely use that especially as we're
finishing out the summer here so that
was a pretty good box I would say for
the blush and what else was in here I
didn't you know the lip balms cool that
I like the masks and I think the
packaging is cute and I hope it works I
think that'll be nice and I don't have
any peel-off masks right now and the
anti cellulite stuff I mean that is nice
and it is summer and we're all exposing
our legs and I think most people are
self-conscious about it and that's okay
so the last box is foxy charm and it
says summertime redness greetings from
Miami this July we're bringing the heat
to you okay all right so whoa so the
first thing in here is really big
says wait a minute we already have this
this is the gorge I'll make you look
amazing daily spray I actually unboxes
not a fabfitfun box that I just got has
this exact same product in it I hope I
like it because if I do I've got to if I
don't then I've got to to deal with I
don't know
so this retails for $30.00 29.95 and
it's basically a leave-in conditioning
spray that like heat protects and D
frizzes and it literally does everything
in one so I am really excited to give
that a try oh and it says get $20 off
gorge hair calm use the code BC 20 so
feel free to use that that's pretty
awesome the next thing in here is this
your mineral Sweden and what it looks
like it's like it's a loose powder it's
white it says transparent veil let's see
what it says about it retails for $26 a
soft transparent setting powder with an
ultra light silk texture it settles into
a soft matte surface while minimizing
fine lines of course
so you apply it over your foundation and
reduce shine and set your makeup so that
sounds pretty awesome a ton in here so
you're not gonna be running out you
actually get to have the product which
that's what I love about these kind of
more expensive boxes you really are
getting full-size um the next thing is
the oprah eyebrow pencil and universal i
literally have like three of these i'm
not even joking now it really it is that
which one is it this one
it is a nice color and the lighter you
know they say the lighter you do it the
lighter the color will be and the harder
you push and there's kind of a gradient
there the darker it will be or the
deeper it will be but i have so many but
i need to keep one and get rid of the
others i need to i already need to
declutter again that's crazy okay
and that one retails for $13 for that it
is nice and it's creamy so if you're
looking for one it's not bad the next
thing is a brush and it's Vasanti brand
it's their blush brush and it retails
for $29 that seems like a lot just
feeling the quality I mean it's soft and
it feels nice but not $29 nice like elfs
brushes feel like this and they're like
three dollars so I'm just saying
so yeah just a blush brush it feels nice
but I again
this is not where $29 knowing no and the
last thing in here is this to mascara it
says indium flow greater than it's an
XXL black and this one retails for $21
the packaging is really really cute I
don't want to open it because I don't
want air to get into it before I can use
it and I've got way too many mascaras
open so I don't want to waste yet
another one but I will certainly let you
guys I'll show you guys the brow movie
on the Instagram when I do finally open
this so along with that one I'm mostly
excited about the mascara and this
finishing powder just because I don't
have I don't think I have a white loose
finishing powder I know I've tried the
alcohol but I don't think I still have
that white one so that would be really
nice to kind of play around with
