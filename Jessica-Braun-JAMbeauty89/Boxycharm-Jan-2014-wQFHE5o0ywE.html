boxycharm for January of 2014 this is
the first subscription box that I've
gotten in the new year
so again they sent it to me last month
and they also sent it to me this month
for free which is really nice so that I
can show you guys what's in it and you
can kind of decide for yourself if this
is a subscription box that you would
like to get or not it's $21 a month and
you get like five to seven full-size
beauty products and I have to admit that
I've already opened it and this is a
really good one and it's better than
last month's and last month I liked it
but this ones is even better
um okay first of all it's always just
like the black box with the writing in
the last month it was a different color
ribbon so I don't know if it changes the
color ribbon each month that's just cute
and then when you open it there's it's
wrapped in tissue paper and there's
always a theme and this theme is cheers
to a new year how appropriate
so this year we want to make sure you're
looking your best start 2014 with your
best foot forward with some of the best
beauty products we've hand selected for
you okay and then it explains what every
single item is and it has on the back so
as we go through it has the price of
what the of what it write in the
full-size retails for oh I'm sorry these
are all full-size stuff so what they
would reel to retail for um separately
so then we can trying to get an idea of
like you know is it worth it or not
because it's $21 a month which is
pricier than most but we'll go through
and you'll see for yourself because I
was really excited about this month's
okay so I'm so excited so it's got this
cute these are always different colors
cute little like I'm filling stuff I'm
so excited that every single one of
these I'm sorry I like can't even
contain it okay we'll start with you
know we'll start with his bigger item
it's a body product and they have it
wrapped very nicely so it doesn't get
messed up during shipping and this is a
full size um let's see it's called the
reveal or rebel or it's not spelled like
revelry
you know what I mean it spelled
different like it's French so I really
don't know it's re ve IL le it's not
gonna show up on there anyway it's a
worn vanilla sugar
did I say worn warm vanilla sugar brown
sugar body polish and I loved it I was
kind of looking at it and showing my
boyfriend it the other night and it just
looks so like like real sugar you know
what I mean and they always say you know
you can use all kinds of different of
sugars for exfoliants so I'm really
excited to try this is a really nice
size it is they're full size and this
retails on its own for 1675 and this
says it's an exfoliating moisturizing
scrub treatment for the body gently
polish away dead surface kills cells and
skin dulling debris to reveal smoother
softer skin beneath and this is a great
thing to do I'm using scrubs I don't
like to use them every single day just
cuz I don't know for me I feel like
that's gonna rub my skin and you
probably can but I just don't and but it
really is nice especially in the winter
just to get rid of that dead skin and
really you know smooth your skin out and
then of course you need a moisturizer
afterwards but so I'm excited really
excited about this actually so they also
sent this be a bombshell single
eyeshadow in birthday suits and this is
perfect timing because my little wet and
wild Brule one that's like a dollar
ninety-nine it's like this for me it's
skin color but it's not skin color for
everyone obviously but kind of this some
like a light peach colored shadow that's
what the white wild one is and it's just
kind of it's a little worse for wear the
packaging kind of falling apart cause
I've had it for quite a while and I've
had to like spray it and smash it back
down with alcohol you know what I mean
just to get to stay together because
I've had forever it lasts forever but
this retails for $14 it's in the exact
same type of casing like matte shadows
are really really cute
that's what the back looks like umm
retails for $14
it says the perfect matte nude color is
great for a base or for highlighting I
agree so I'm really excited about that
in packaging is cute okay because
packaging really matters by the way I
saw in my local CVS which I bought some
things at CVS and I will be doing a haul
soon on that stuff because I also
ordered a few things from Mac not that
many things just a few things
so I'll have to do another video on that
stuff but anyway I saw that they have
the Physicians Formula little um I don't
know what the collection is called it's
like nude glow and all these little
glowy products and they all are like
rose gold packaging with like little
bows all over them like I literally was
holding all of them and I'm like I
literally went on I didn't buy any cuz
I'm like they're gonna be on sale in a
hot second and then I can get them cuz
come on I'm not made of money I'm gonna
be a teacher and I'm not even a teacher
yet so if that tells you anything okay I
just got coffee you ever drink coffee
and it like splashes up and now I've got
like a coffee like stash up here okay so
the next thing I love all of this okay
this is the model code gel eyeliner how
cute is this box Jo eyeliner with
inbuilt brush long wear black gel
eyeliner I was glad to see this is black
because I'm running low on my L'Oreal
infallible one that I used I just
dropped the box but it's one that looks
like this like the Revlon Colorstay and
a lot look like this now where the brush
you just pull this off and there's the
actual little brush there and then you
can just flip it and put it on and then
you've got a handy dandy notebook no I'm
kidding who can name that show I hope
most of you can if you've got a kid you
definitely get just a little brush and
of course it's just black um oh I was
gonna say where's the lid classic how
many times am I gonna do that I bet a
lot um so you know good packaging great
for travel because you got the brush
with you and what's nice is if for
whatever reason you're in a spot where
you can't like wipe this off you know
how you've got it you have to wipe off
the eyeliner if you're gonna pack it but
if you're in a spot where you're
traveling and you can't wipe it off for
some reason you could just stick it back
in and know that at least it's not going
to get on the sudden your makeup bag
it's not gonna be great for the brush
but you know it's nice to have that
often so that retails for $22 and like I
said all of these are the full size so
this retails for $22 wait now I'm
looking at the wrong one no I was
looking for any one $22 um it says the
smooth gel based liner achieves
beautiful long lasting lines offering
the precision of a liquid liner with the
application ease of a gel for foolproof
beauty I love gel meddlers okay um the
next thing is this spa ritual
nail polish I hope that yeah the color
seems to be coming through isn't that
beautiful
it's like it reminds me of Essie I have
it like wrapped in rubies but I've never
tried this brand and this is a really
cute bottle I think it's a really just
cute shape again like it matters but
whatever I just love the color it's in
the color flower child and it's a
shimmer and I can't wait to wear this it
definitely makes me think a fall in
winter for right now it's still winter
so of course I'll probably your wear it
year-round who cares okay and that one
retails for spa ritual Oh $12 jeez
Louise but um I'm really excited to try
it and then the last thing is this
full-size lip gloss no I'm sorry it's a
liquid lipstick so it's the Ofra or
ultra brand if you know how to say that
let me know because I am curious it's
their long-lasting liquid lipstick and
Angeles or unless it's on headlights I
don't know depends on what language
you're speaking I guess and I'm sure
that looks backwards to you but um sorry
if she knows this retails for 1990 and
I'll swatch this on my hand it looks
like it's just like a nude whoa it's
certainly like thicker if you can kind
of see that it's like it's sort of like
wha'd lipstick is it good but it oh the
texture is really not oh my gosh it
smells like vanilla I love that this is
a very interesting it's definitely a
nude nude like like nude colored liquid
lipstick I guess so
you know what this might be great
because I'm really fair skinned so I
wonder how that'll look with my skin
tone I don't know that it'll look that
great I'll try it of course but it would
probably be really nice over a really
deeper gloss like this or especially
even deeper ones something like this and
kind of mute it a little bit although I
don't know because it seems pretty
opaque this is beautiful though and I
really like the texture and the smell so
I might have to look into this and see
what other colors because I'm now I'm
curious which is the whole point right
for these companies to do this okay
anyway so this is the full-size it's
1990 jeez Louise almost twenty dollars
and says it's a one-step full lip color
that is creamy and soft and texture
while moisturizing the lips and creating
a long-lasting lips
effective certainly feels moisturizing
on my hand I guess we'll see on my lips
so I'll have to let you know but that is
everything and this was I think honestly
it's been one of my favorite boxes I've
ever gotten all the products in this are
actually useful for me they all seem
well-made it's certainly worth the price
let's do this math so if it's twenty one
dollars a month
seventeen this is gonna be rough thirty
thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty
about eighty five dollars in total and
you only pay $21 to get it so I I was
really impressed and you can ask my
boyfriend I don't know how you would but
you could because he was there when I
was opening it and kind of looked
through it looking through it and I was
just like every single product actually
likes and I feel like every box that I
get whether it's if C birch box whatever
look there's always something that I'm
just like oh but this one I mails here
did I get a package I'm waiting on my
speaking of Ipsy I'm waiting on my Ipsy
box she's staring at me making this
video this is hilarious she's like what
are you doing anyway um hahaha oh wait
she's still delivering mail and still
staring at me yeah she didn't see me
wave this is so funny it's this is the
weirdest thing making videos because
people are just like what are you doing
you know what I mean it's just such an
odd it's almost even hard to explain to
other people what I do like on the side
they're like wait what do you do I'm
like I make videos and I like review
products and you know like makeup and
they're like wait what they're people
watch that like yeah people watch that
tons of people do but it's just so funny
like I'm not even why is the mail lady
still here she's still like looking at
me and like driving by slow she's trying
to drive over snow banks there's so much
snow here okay well if you're still
watching this good for you because I the
Box ended a long time ago you must
really care anyway so I was really
really honestly honestly impressed with
this box this month so definitely check
them out if you're interested and yeah I
guess that is all and I'll catch you
guys very soon on a haul coming up
I'm gonna be doing a new makeup
collection video soon which I'm very
excited about just be patient but it's
it's gonna be nice I want to try and do
a makeup collection like an updated one
more often not just once a year maybe
even twice a year because honestly for
me it's just kind of fun to see like
going back to my first one and watching
and going to the second one to see you
know it's card this will be my third one
already which is crazy but I think
they're just fun and I catch myself
watching makeup collection videos more
than i watch any other videos so anyway
okay so that is all I will shut up and
I'll catch you guys very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
