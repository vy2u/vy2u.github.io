boxycharm
unboxing for month of March and I know
March is almost over but it's such a
good deal it's 15 dollars a month and I
have just fallen in love with this
company and it's crazy because I love it
see so much and it's only ten dollars
but this one just always seems to at
least the past few months it's just it's
better and you'll see why this is what
it looks like and different colored
ribbon each time that usually has to do
with the theme so let's see it says
spring beauty so it sounds like it's all
spring theme and it's got a breakdown of
how much everything costs regularly so
and it's all purple and oh it all kind
of got shoved didn't it okay so the
first thing I see is this pur Lisse pur
moist hide your balance moisturizer and
let's see what it says about it mmm the
original oh so this is a full-size it's
1.7 ounces yeah you can tell us we'll
size and this retails for $55 for this
size oh my gosh
and it says this delicate hydrating
moisturizer is infused with ingredients
to give your skin a boost against
environmental damage so that's really
nice it says it's sensitive and
anti-aging normal to dry it's got
vitamin E French marine plants white tea
and blue Lotus and says you can use it
day and night after cleansing and toning
of course so cool I'm really excited to
try that I've never tried anything from
the pur Lisse brand so that's gonna be
really nice sorry if I sound stuffy I've
got a cold yet again you guys ever feel
like that where you get sick and you
just get over it and then like three
weeks later you've got another cold
well longer than that but still okay the
next thing is this model Co oh yay the
lipstick party proof cream lipstick and
it's in the shade pinking of you that is
so yes look at this packaging it's white
it's got a mirror and it says model Co
oh my gosh look at that pink
oh it definitely feels incredibly creamy
it's just a bubblegum pink that is so
pretty I'll have to try it out and see
if it's how it wears because it does
feel really really creamy and
moisturizing for sure what does it say
this retails for seventeen dollars
Wow but this is so beautiful it says it
doesn't dry or flake we'll see
ultraviolet long-lasting even has a
built-in mirror so this is so cute oh my
gosh I'm so excited to try that next
thing is it looks like nail polish it's
I guess the brand is called strange
beautiful and these are both full-size
there's two of them and they retail for
$18 these are like in similar packaging
to like the julep polishes you know but
it's two-step well no I don't know it's
a three free product so it doesn't have
formaldehyde to to lean I don't know how
to say that and DBP but they're like
connected by the packaging so I could
probably pull them apart but they're all
wrapped so I think it's willow and
band-aid I don't know how I feel about
the names of the colors but this and I
don't really know how I feel about the
colors to be honest this like orangish
and this gray I don't know maybe I'll
give it a try maybe it'll be in a
giveaway because I don't I don't think
their colors that for me I would wear I
think it may be someone that was Tanner
or darker than I was might look okay but
I don't know anyway okay moving on next
thing is this bellapierre shimmer powder
in this retails for $14.99 and it's just
a little pot and that it's called earth
and it looks yeah it looks like it's
just this beautiful bronze color I'm not
gonna open it I feel like I have like
ten of these bronze colored dusts and I
don't need any more so again this might
find its way into a giveaway alright
next thing is this bellapierre makeup
base and this retails for 1899 what do
they mean makeup base it says this
wonderful makeup base helps transform Oh
shimmer powder so ones like this the
other one I just showed
you transform shimmer powders from
shimmery to matte after all variety is
the spice of life it can also be used as
a concealer for hard to cover up
blemishes okay so it sounds like it's
like a new color cream shadow or you
know what I mean okay it really is I
want to feel it huh it feels really
really creamy you're not gonna be able
see it up wash so you kind of can't see
it's not shimmery though but yeah it's
just this beige colored they said you
could use this concealer I don't know if
it's thick enough well maybe it
certainly is moisturizing I kind of want
to try that under my eye and just see
what happens one day who knows cuz it is
it's really moisturizing it feels nice
anyway but in the packaging actually is
really cute can you guys see that it's
just cute so alright so the total retail
value 5570 I don't feel like doing that
math I mean it looks like it's it's well
over 100 it looks like it's almost 130
dollar retail value so if you go back in
my box of charm videos from the past
you'll see that it really has
progressively gotten better and better
and I'm just it keeps kicking if seeing
Burch boxes but to be completely honest
so really excited about this retail
value ice is definitely worth it
so I hope that was helpful for you guys
if you're interested of course there'll
be a link below and of course more
information about this will also be
below and I'll catch you guys very soon
