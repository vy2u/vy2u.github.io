a boxycharm unboxing and this is for the
month of February so I'm kind of cutting
it close on like it's almost March but
uh so I figure I should film it um so it
always comes in a box like this it had a
pink ribbon on it but I've already taken
it off so this is a subscription box
that comes once a month if you choose
you can cancel it at any time and it's
$21 a month and you get five to seven
beauty products now what I have been
liking about the boxycharm boxes is that
a lot of times you've already heard of
the brands that sounds really stupid but
sometimes it's nice like you'll get some
drugstore you'll get some high-end it's
always a really good mix so I've I
really kind of fallen in love with
boxycharm and I feel like each time I
get a box I love it a little bit more so
and this one was no different it they
might be the cutest ones the way they
package them they always have something
cute like this is for Valentine's Day so
it's a little sweetheart sticker and of
course it's kind of Valentine's themed
and it goes through what you get in the
box and the prices so we are gonna
tabulate this and see if it ends up
being worth the $21 it looks like it
definitely will be but we'll look anyway
so it always looks so cute so one of the
things the first thing I see are these
eyelashes and this looks like what brand
is it it's the brand eyelash II and it's
hand tied lashes and the full size is
nine dollars it says and they look kind
of natural as natural as fake lashes can
be you know what I mean
so right now you guys know I don't
really wear lashes but it's always nice
to have a few bit look how adorable it
like it's like a little drawer it's just
so cute so that is nine dollars on its
own now the next thing I see is a NARS I
almost have lipstick no I wish nail
polish and the shade is ver sale oh my
gosh stop I just sounded like I was from
Indiana which I am Versailles I am so
embarrassed there's a town in Indiana
and it's pronounced the way that it is
just pronounced here is Versailles
actually and and it smelled like
Versailles because obviously that's what
it's named after and so now I'm
embarrassed that I just said it the nd
in a way Versailles I'm sorry
everyone that speaks French or if you're
from France Versailles anyway okay so
it's this really pretty kind of like
golden e color also yeah I'm I will
explain what these stains on my hands
are in a second and you will laugh at me
when I tell you there so this nail
polish is retails for $19.99 okar with
just those two things
we've already break in or we've already
saved money because it was a $21 box so
let's keep going shall we the next thing
is this we'll do this one a Mirabella
what is this an eye definer and the full
side this is a full size and it's $19 I
think all of these are just full sized
so it's $19 originally and it oh it's in
bronze so it's all silvery and Purdy
let's give it a swatch aru it's
certainly just you know typical bronze
color there's nothing really special
about it but you know what I will say
that I like that it's not shimmery or
sparkly or anything so a lot of times I
don't use the stark black under my eye
I'll just use some sort of brownish
color so this would be one I would
totally use and every time I use a
shimmery pencil no matter the brand I
always end up with a little bit of
glitter down here so this is actually
gonna be really nice to not have any
glitter in it so I'm excited and it's a
solid full size so that was twenty eight
and this was 19 so that's thirty forty
seven dollars so far is that math write
down so the next thing is another
Mirabella product and what is this is
the Lala lips I think this is one of
their new products I was watching Sam
Sherman's video if you watch her she's
just so cute and I think she featured a
bunch of Mirabella products and this is
one of their new ones this is the sweet
velvet lip pencil and it's in the shade
well I don't know yet
it looks really pretty so far so it's
just a classic like crayon type oh it
glides on like crazy smooth oh isn't
that so pretty and this is like really
cute and this is just cute and it's not
as like fat as most of the lip pencil
type like you know I think of the Revlon
balm stains and things like that those
are so thick this is like really small
and the full size which this is I think
it's got to be is $23 so what is that
like now we're at like $70 this is crazy
and then the last thing
is this Pandora's I've never heard of
this brand Pandora's box and it's what
is this Pandora's make a box at the
blush which retails for $18 whoa okay
that was adorable this is what it looks
like it's like paper packaging kind of
like the balm has you know and it's in
the shade no please tell me this is it
just says palette blush that's what it
says and I it looks like you can remove
yeah oh that's actually not a bad thing
you can remove it yeah I think the shade
is pow
and it looks like a really light coral
colored blush very light I feel like it
could look really pretty and like light
on a darker skin person like it would
show up kind of satiny or if you're
really fair like me it would show up I
want I wonder if like mid-tone skin it
really wouldn't show up on I don't know
I mean it's nice and pigmented I don't
know that's really pretty though and it
feels like the I can't stops watching it
it feels like the balm blushes to be
honest it's that's really really nice
so I'm actually really excited so that
was five full-size products like a
million dollars I don't feel like doing
the math anymore
um but I to be honest I'm impressed this
might be my favorite one yet I don't
know though because last month was
really awesome too and you saw how
excited I was in that video because it
was just really awesome it was awesome
so I want to explain the stains I'm
again so I had gotten some referral
credits from some of you guys signing up
for Birchbox like with my links below
and so I've gotten some referral credits
on Birchbox website now you can't return
return what redeem those credits for
boxes like monthly boxes but you can get
like full-sized products so I was kind
of going through and I needed a new
detangling spray because I had been
using the it's a 10 miracle spray but
I'm almost out and I'm like scraping it
dry and you've got to spray it so it's
really tricky
oh no the battery's running low anyway
so I found this Bain de terre I'm
probably butchering that it's their
instant combing detangler and I haven't
tried it yet but I'm excited and it was
like 13 bucks on there so it was not bad
so I'll link this below and the other
thing I got was the lipstick that I'm
wearing I'm sure you guys are like woah
just that's the darkest thing you've
ever worn on your lips
ever and that's exactly what I thought
when I put it on but I was like it's
okay like I don't know that I'd wear
this out though I don't know but I
bought it because or I got it with the
referral credits because it was my
favorite it's the best samay or bass ma
lipsticks that I love and I love the
shade exotic pink and every time the
past few videos you guys are asking me
what I'm wearing it's always that so it
comes in an adorable the lower little
packaging and oh my gosh and it's in
this is in the shade cherry red and it's
just so much darker than I thought and I
looked at swatches online well that
doesn't look that bad it looks so much
darker my lips though doesn't it like
probably because my lips are semi
pigmented on their own not crazy
pigmented but but isn't that gorgeous so
I just love the formula of these so
definitely check it out you can't really
buy this brand in many places you can
get it at on Birchbox website Besame has
their own website it's the same price
but I figure you might as well get it on
Birchbox at least I do because I don't
know I figure you get points I think for
buying things on there too I don't know
if you do actually don't pull and by the
way the stains on my hand are from just
applying this lipstick and like
literally I like I got some of my teeth
so it's been like this and I got a
little bit there and then I wiped it and
then a stain I'm like oh my gosh so I
can only imagine that the my lips are
going to be stained however not the
worst thing if you have a color on that
you liked and it's kind of stained all
day like and just throw some balm and
over it and it's just like good to go
you know so I'll have to let you know
because this color is vampy it's kind of
fun though right I don't know I just
can't decide maybe I should return it I
don't know what do you guys think I know
it's gonna be so splitsville and like
half of you guys are gonna be like I
hate it and half are gonna be like it's
awesome
or maybe all of you guys are gonna be
one way I don't know I feel like it's
not even even although I don't think my
lips are even I am not symmetrical at
all okay that's all I'll talk about
today I'll shut up with my crazy dark
lips anyway but I'll catch you guys very
very soon and I hope you guys are having
a wonderful wonderful wonderful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
