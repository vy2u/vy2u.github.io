be unboxing my boxycharm for January
2016 I usually do this video with like
my Ipsy unbagging and all that stuff but
they come at such different times of the
month for me that I ended up waiting and
then suddenly it's the end of the month
and the next ones already come out and
I'm finally getting the video up because
I finally have both of them together
sorry I'm just decided I'm just gonna do
them as they come so this is boxycharm
let's go ahead and do a good show so the
theme is eyes on 2016 and the first
thing I'm seeing is this I brush set and
it says it's called the royal and
langnickel brush set full-size it's $24
so they're like 8 bucks apiece 8 times 3
is 24 I can tell they're synthetic and I
almost don't want to open this I'm just
gonna pass this on right off the bat
because I know for my taste
I really like non-synthetic like kind of
more natural bristles because I feel
like it blends the shadows better this
the shadow never applies correctly for
me in my taste
and it doesn't blend well so I just know
that I don't like them I know that one
of my sisters will and I'm going to my
parents house today so I think I'm just
gonna literally save this hand it off to
them they will love it a lot of people
do like synthetic brushes that's just a
my taste thing next thing it's the
reveal
smokey so the reveal house if you don't
know about them most of you guys
probably do but if you don't the brand
is Coastal Scents
and they put out these pallets that are
very very similar to the Urban Decay
palette so they've got like they're
revealed one and you revealed two and
they're all like similar to the naked
palettes and of course Urban Decay just
came out with their smoky palette so
suddenly Coastal Scents has their smoky
palette I do think that's funny
there's nothing wrong with it because I
mean clearly it's really big right now
so but the thing about the reveal
palettes is they have way more shadows
in it way more and it's much cheaper so
the price for this is I don't know I was
thinking these are way cheaper I just
to the price and it's $40 for this now
yes it comes with a lot more shadows but
I would say spend a little bit more and
just by the naked palettes cuz they're
even better these are still really good
but unless you find a crazy deal and I
know sometimes on the Coastal Scents
website they'll have really good deals
on this stuff but $40 seems steep for
this I'm just gonna say it and maybe I'm
the only one that thinks that way but it
looks like they've got some nude or some
matte shadows and a lot of shimmer let's
just watch some so I'm gonna swatch this
nude so I'm going to swatch - why do I
keep saying nude I mean Matt and I'm
also going to swatch some shimmering
ones just to get an idea just watching
the ones I would wear
so these are some matte white Wow here's
a shimmery one and another one okay hmm
let me try a few others because I don't
I don't feel like that's a fair shake
for this kiss the thing is with so many
shadows they're so hit-or-miss that not
all of them are gonna be good so let's
try a couple other sharing ones see if
we can get it better okay that looks
pretty so this one swatch really weird
it's just so powdery this one however
looks pretty so that's just it it's so
hit-or-miss so some of them are crazy
creamy crazy beautiful others are really
powdery and not pigmented so you know
when you're getting down any shadows
though I don't think that's the worst
thing well in an ideal world they're all
perfect is really it so I would say
really I don't know don't buy it for $40
if you're gonna buy it
get a good deal on it like if they have
a 50% off sale on their site do not
spend $40 on this spend $40 on a to face
palette they're way better but still
crazy that this came in the boxy term I
mean can we just say that I keep
forgetting this isn't a review of this
this is the fact that in a $20 boxycharm
you're getting a $40 palette that is
pretty crazy so for that reason alone
that's amazing I need to keep my eyes on
the prize here so the next thing is this
mascara from blink and it's full size
I love boxy terms pretty good about that
and it comes in like a tube and I think
the reason it does is because this is a
tubing mascara where the idea is when
you apply it it's almost as if the
mascara creates little tubes on your
lashes I don't like the idea that that
grosses me out now that I'm saying it
out loud I'm still gonna try it but I
don't even like talking about it I don't
know why it does it that freak anyone
else out I can't think about it anymore
okay stop
anyway i'll try to-- okay the next thing
is from starlooks
moran i used to unbox the star boxes
like the star look star box I was always
so hit or miss with those because some
of their products are really good and
some of them are were really bad but
they were really overpriced for what it
was and I always said that I think I
made the company star looks mad because
I was very honest I mean I always am but
I think I was I mean I was very honest
about how I felt like their prices were
ridiculous for what they were putting
out they weren't very well known and
they were crazy expensive so unless you
got the star box you I mean it was too
much so they stopped sending it to me in
a way that's fine or just being honest
this is their luxe long wear eyeliner
pen so does that oh no not two sides so
if I feel like it looks like there
should be another part to it like that
twist there's not so it looks like it's
a felt tip eyeliner whoo it's crazy
black oh I like it you can get really
thin you can get pretty thick I like
that and if it stays this black as it
dries so I will definitely use this I
always use something like this to do my
wing and to just kind of go over my gel
liner so that will definitely get used
so that was everything in the box
typically it comes with five things that
was only four but I think because this
was such a big item a big ticket item if
you will that kind of makes sense I
don't mind it as much they said before
another one of the revealed palettes so
that is pretty cool like I said
overpriced alone but really cool that it
comes in the box eternal and there's
some nice shadows in it so that was
pretty awesome I Boxey trauma
has a special place in my heart because
I love that it's full size if see I love
to but you know you're paying a little
more but you're getting full-size things
so then if you really really like it you
have the full-size but then on the other
hand if you hate it you have a full-size
of something you don't like it's kind of
like tip for tat you know anyway so
hopefully you enjoyed this I will link
