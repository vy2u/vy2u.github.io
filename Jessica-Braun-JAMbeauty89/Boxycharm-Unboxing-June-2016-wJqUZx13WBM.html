gonna unbox the boxy charm for the month
of june I'm waiting on my Ipsy to arrive
I know it shipped but I'm leaving town
tomorrow so I was like I want to at
least share this with you guys cuz by
the time I get back it'll basically be
July so I don't know if I'll still do
the Ipsy but it will just be super late
let me know below if you're still going
to be dying to see it but I know by then
a ton of unboxings will have already
happened so just let me know but boxy
charm is 21 dollars a month let's go
ahead and dig in though it says um girls
just wanna have set uh oh god just wanna
have some though the first thing right
on top is this pharmacy spelled with an
F hydrating coconut gel mask ooh with
echinacea green envy and it says it's a
brightening one activated by activated
by anti zine rich purple broccoli
extract wow that it's made exclusively
for boxy charm so is it like a one time
oh there's a couple so you open it and
there are three in here and it just says
to clean your skin remove the mask
unfold it put it on your face leave it
on for 20 to 25 minutes remove and
gently massage the excess of formula
into your skin that sounds fun I love
coconut based things i don't know why i
don't know if it's because of the smell
I don't know if it's because i don't
know i just love it so these because it
makes me think of like beach vacations
but um yes i'm really excited about that
i will definitely try and i love that
it's got more than one use cuz the thing
about masks like if you try one and it's
a one time using you're like oh my gosh
i loved that you have to go buy it again
you know which it makes sense but it's
really nice when there's a couple i hope
i like it i'm thinking about bringing
one of these with me on vacation to try
just like on a night we're going to
disney world which we go a couple times
a year most of you already know that
we're like a huge disney nerds and
tylers now a disney travel agents so we
feel like we haven't excuse even though
we would go regardless if you are
wanting to see what we're up to i'll be
doing tons of snapchat videos instagram
posts we're definitely gonna be vlogging
we always post our vlogs however on my
husband's channel so i'll link it below
if you're wanting to see what we're up
to we vlog a ton it's a lot of fun this
next thing is all bubble wrap
oh it's by the brand Oprah it's their
pressed powder oil control and so it's
just clearly a white I presume it would
go on kind of translucent although
that's pretty white definitely is white
like even when you swatch it you know
you can see that when you rub it in it
still kind of stays pretty white of
course you're going to be using a brush
it's going to apply a little differently
to be honest I'm not that oily so this
is one of those powders I probably would
not use a lot I'm certainly going to try
it specially here in the summertime I
guess I could bring it with me to Disney
World because it's gonna be you know
like 90-something degrees except for
like every day it's supposed to
thunderstorm too so you know how that
goes Florida weather so I'll think about
bringing this just because that might be
really nice to truly mattify but I don't
mind having a little bit of shine
country I don't we'll see next thing is
from girl lactic might be the first girl
actic product I've ever owned it's their
precise eyeliner marker in black noir
ooh I can't draw a straight line for the
life of me it's very very black I see
that it's starting to kind of feather
out but not a ton um it's got the same
kind of tip that I really like it's like
my see let's say all day one so this I
will definitely use I'll use liquid
liner every day to get the little wing
and I just kind of top everything with
it so i'll definitely use this i'll let
you know how it is so the next thing it
says it's cougar by paula done and it's
a mineral face and body shimmer and
diamond kiss so it's I mean these are
definitely full size as they usually are
and it looks like it's like yellow tone
so i don't know if it's supposed to be
used like as a highlight it's kind of
it's got a nice shimmer I mean it
doesn't really show up because it's I
mean it's just a loose finely milled
powder but um it definitely has kind of
a golden gleam to it so I feel like this
actually might be really nice as a
highlighter it is yellow tone so I think
if you have more of a warm tone skin you
would probably really like this it just
says lightly apply the product to
desired areas using a fluffy brush okay
well thank you um so this I will
definitely try i don't know that i have
any loose highlighters right now so I'm
really intrigued by that last thing in
here is a full-size nail polish by lv
x I know we've gotten one at least from
them before it was kind of a peach color
and I still haven't tried it this is a
really pretty like periwinkle color in
serene it's a good name for it see how
opaque it is looks pretty darn opaque
now I know a lot of the people that
commented on my last 11 we got one of
these said that it i dont rember if you
guys said it was streaky or if it
chipped really quickly i don't know but
i'll try this probably like my sex feat
top coat to make sure it stays on for a
decently long time but i'm excited i
love this kind of a color that was
everything in the box let me know what
you got in your box this month i'm also
curious if you've tried any of these or
if you tried some other things what you
would recommend let me know down below i
will link my subscription box playlist
if you're curious about what i got last
month in my box each arm and my Ipsy and
many others and other than that I hope
that you'll subscribe and I'll see you
