gonna unbox the boxycharm for the month
of June I'm waiting on my Ipsy to arrive
I know it shipped but I'm leaving town
tomorrow so I was like I want to at
least share this with you guys cuz by
the time I get back it'll basically be
July so I don't know if I'll still do
the Ipsy but it would just be super late
let me know below if you're still gonna
be dying to see it but I know by then a
ton of unboxings will have already
happened so just let me know
but boxycharm is $21 a month let's go
ahead and dig in though it says girls
just wanna have step Oh though the first
thing right on top is this pharmacy
spelled with an F I'm hydrating coconut
gel mask ooh with echinacea green NZ and
it says it's a brightening one activated
by activated by anti zine rich purple
broccoli extract Wow done it's made
exclusively for boxycharm so is it like
a one time oh there's a couple so you
open it and there are three in here and
it just says to clean your skin remove
the mask unfold it put it on your face
leave it on for 20 to 25 minutes remove
and gently massage the excess of formula
into your skin that sounds fun I love
coconut based things I don't know why I
don't know if it's because it's smell I
don't know if it's because I don't know
I just love it so these because it makes
me think of like beach vacations but yes
I'm really excited about that I will
definitely try and I love that it's got
more than one use because the thing
about masks like if you try one and it's
a one-time-use and you're like oh my
gosh I loved that you have to go buy it
again you know which it makes sense but
it's really nice when there's a couple I
hope I like it
I'm thinking about bringing one of these
with me on vacation to try just like on
a night we're going to Disney World
which we go a couple times a year most
of you already know that we're like a
huge disney nerds and Tyler's now a
Disney travel agent so we feel like we
have an excuse even though we would go
regardless if you are wanting to see
what we're up to I'll be doing tons of
snapchat videos Instagram posts we're
definitely gonna be vlogging we always
post our vlogs however on my husband's
Channel so I'll link it below if you're
wanting to see what we're up to we vlog
a ton that's a lot of fun this next
thing is all bubble wrap
oh it's by the brand Oprah it's their
pressed powder oil control and so it's
just clearly a white I presume it would
go on kind of translucent although
that's pretty white definitely is white
like even when you swatch it you know
you can see that when you rub it in it
still kind of stays pretty white of
course you're gonna be using a brush
it's gonna apply a little differently to
be honest I'm not that oily so this is
one of those powders I probably would
not use a lot I'm certainly gonna try it
especially here in the summertime I
guess I could bring it with me to Disney
World because it's gonna be you know
like 90 something degrees except for
like everyday it's supposed to
thunderstorm too so you know how that
goes Florida weather so I'll think about
bringing this just because that might be
really nice to truly mattify but I don't
mind having a little bit of shine
country I don't know we'll see next
thing is from girl lactic this might be
the first girl act ik product I've ever
owned it's their precise eyeliner marker
in black noir ooh I can't draw a
straight line for the life of me it's
very very black I see that it's starting
to kind of feather out but not a ton
it's got the same kind of tip that I
really like it's like my see let's say
all day one so this I will definitely
use I will use liquid liner every day to
get the little wing and I just kind of
top everything with it
so I'll definitely use this I'll let you
know how it is so the next thing it says
it's cougar by palo done and it's a
mineral face and body shimmer and
diamond kiss so it's I mean these are
definitely full-sized as they usually
are and it looks like it's like yellow
tone so I don't know if it's supposed to
be used like as a highlight it's kind of
it's got a nice shimmer I mean it
doesn't really show up because it's I
mean it's just a loose finely milled
powder but um it definitely has kind of
a golden gleam to it so I feel like this
actually might be really nice as a
highlighter it is yellow tone so I think
if you have more of a warm tone skin you
would probably really like this it just
says lightly apply the product to
desired areas using a fluffy brush okay
well thank you so this I will definitely
try I don't know that I have any loose
highlighters right now so I'm really
intrigued by that last thing in here is
a full-size nail polish by LV
I know we've gotten one at least from
them before it was kind of a peach color
and I still haven't tried it this is a
really pretty like periwinkle color in
serene it's a good name for it
see how opaque it is looks pretty darn
opaque now I know a lot of the people
that commented on my last one one we got
one of these said that it I don't
remember if you guys said it was streaky
or if it chipped really quickly I don't
know but I'll try this probably like my
sex beat top coat to make sure it stays
on for a decently long time but I'm
excited I love this kind of a color that
was everything in the box let me know
what you got in your box this month I'm
also curious if you've tried any of
these or if you tried some other things
what you would recommend let me know
down below I will link my subscription
box playlist if you're curious about
what I got last month in my boxy charm
and my Ipsy and many others and other
than that I hope that you'll subscribe
and I'll see you guys in my next video
