different makeup subscription boxes to
open I am so excited I'll be opening up
see and glossy box and foxy charm
all of these are sent to me by the
companies for consideration for me to do
with what I want and I like to unbox
them here on my channel so you guys can
kind of see what's in them etc so any
information you might have want to know
like the prices of them etc will be
below I've said etcetera like twice
already and it's been like 30 seconds
stop saying etc alright let's get into
it so let's start with the cheapest one
which is epsy and it always comes with a
makeup bag this one is $10 a month and
this one is really cute like a canvas
type bag and it says contents my life
breakups to make up I like that um so
let's see what's inside
I haven't peaked yet sometimes I have to
admit sometimes I peek because I'm just
like like I can't wait but I actually
was really good this meant that I have
not looked at all so okay but first
thing is like bigger can't quite get it
out okay so it's a card its Urban Decay
revolution high color lip gloss oh okay
so it's got like the lip gloss two
different shades here I kind of hate
things like that I never end up trying
them out I don't know why I really
should but it's just such a hassle I
might forget that time for all that but
it did come with this Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on lip pencil and ozone colors
this huh it bro where's that the tips oh
it's in the very so the tip broke off
that sucks but it's like white so it
must be like a yeah it's you can't see
it it's like a clear wax so I would
assume you what would you put this on
the outside here lips - let's see prep
your lips this lip pencil applies
invisibly glides on smoothly and grabs
onto color so you actually put it on
your lips I wasn't sure a lot of people
you know you'll put it around your lips
but on this one you actually line your
lips and fill it in and this is like a
primer and it keeps it in place so once
I sharpen it that will be cool that
stinks that it was already broke up
that's right so very cool I actually am
excited to give
want to try because then like for travel
for example I'm going to be gone for
three weeks for my honeymoon I could if
I like to this just bring this and I
wouldn't really have to worry about a
bunch of different lip liner colors to
go with different this would go with
anything so that's pretty cool the next
thing in here is a brush now they've
sent some of this brand whatever brand
it is a Luxy is the brand they've set a
few of these brushes but this one it's
their tapered blending number 205 is
like the kind I use in my crease every
day just kind of sloppily putting the
medium color in the middle this will
absolutely be used so I'm actually
really excited about that one the next
thing in here is this bellapierre
cosmetics gel eyeliner in Ebony I'm
hoping I would assume evany would be
like black and I'm kind of hoping it is
because yeah it is
it's black but it's kind of a gray tone
when you see it um well it blackens if
you layer it it gets yeah so that was
with one swipe and that's with a few
layers so it's not too bad if the kind
that you sharpen I will certainly give
it a try yeah it looks a lot blacker
with two layers okay the next thing is
this
well the organic pharmacy face cream
double rose rejuvenating cream o for
radiant glowing skin so it says apply
every morning after cleansing so I mean
I think it's just a moisturizer right oh
wow it really does it's just kind of
like a white cream it really does smell
like roses so if you don't like the Rose
smell you would not like this but it
feels like silk once it's rubbed in wow
that's a very strong rose scent I don't
know if I can handle that much Rose whoo
but if you like rose you will love this
the last thing in here is that's not
your mother's and I actually do like
this brand deja voodoo style extender so
it says lock in style into your next
shampoo this unique lightweight cream
will ward off any bad hair spirits it'll
block humidity repel dirt and oil but it
adds body and flexible hold okay this is
a lot of claims made with conditioners
for long-lasting frizz control and
improved shine okay but how do you use
it
begin with damp hair
apply a nickel size amount to poems put
it all over your roots to tips focus on
the areas of your hair that tend to get
the most oily so you'd focus it like for
me I would certainly focus it up near my
roots comb hair then silent as desired
I'm actually really excited because for
me if you do have oily hair like mine by
the end of the day it is totally oily
mine's a mess cuz Tim it out and I guess
it's gonna rain and I've been in and out
I look my hair doesn't look its best
anyway this could be a lifesaver for me
because gosh my hair gets oily so fast
so this is fantastic
so that's all that was in the Ipsy bag I
need for $10 to get the Urban Decay one
even though it's broken a really good
brush the liner seems nice and this I'm
just excited to try and then the you
know the face cream um where was that
yeah it's still really strong I was
hoping the scent would die down but it
really hasn't but for ten bucks that's a
lot so that is really I think of one of
the better if see bags that I've gotten
recently so that is awesome okay so
let's do the glossy box next and then
we'll do the boxycharm so the glossy box
is this adorable pink box last month was
the first time they sent one to me and
it didn't have their classic box because
it was like a special themed one and I
was kind of sad because like all I was
hoping to get the cute one with the cute
inside day so let's see oh this is the
thing that tells all the prices alright
so the first thing in here is this
Sebastian oh that's a good brand style
britta'd 9 it's so it's a hybrid
hairspray it says what is it supposed to
do you can spray it on damp or dry hair
to add hold style as desired okay I mean
that's it so I think maybe that's why it
doesn't really say why it's multi
benefit but regardless let's see what
the price for the full size of this is
the price is 1996 for the full size and
of course this is just the travel size
so it's a heat protector it adds volume
and texture Wow
paraben and alcohol free it's
lightweight also offers curl definition
UV protection and enhances shine okay
that is
benefit if it really does do all that
that will be amazing that's pretty cool
so but $20 from full-size I mean if it
were that amazing though I would totally
pay that okay the next thing in here is
this Oh glam glow power mod dual cleanse
treatment so for this one Wow the full
size of this is $69 but it says it's for
all skin types it's hypoallergenic
dermatologist tested treatment features
a custom for clay blend alongside
cleansers and exfoliant for super clean
velvety skin so it sounds like me that's
clearly a cleanser so that's I'm
actually interested to try that it's
kind of like the greenish grayish tone
and it's got you can feel the little
exfoliating beads in there too
so it smells really good
well I guess it's mixing with that rose
but it actually does smell really nice
so that's pretty cool so the next thing
in here is this first of all this
adorable box but the brand is teased
with three ease trendy cosmetics and
it's a nail lacquer and I think the
color is cadmium rush yeah okay first of
all the packaging of this is so cute so
reminds me of like the julep polish
because it's like a almost almost like a
lip gloss ooh why I smell it it's nail
polish not lip gloss yes I literally
like inhaled that hard that was real
gross but it's a really okay here's how
I would describe this color it's like a
coral but it's like a muted coral like
it's been toned down just a little bit I
really like this color so I'm excited to
try that and I've never heard of this
brand but I cannot get over the
packaging so this retails for $14 and it
is the full size next we've got a clear
Easter retexturizing gel so what does
this say about this the full-size of
this is $80 oh my gosh
it's a complexion perfecting gel smooth
skin and refines pores so is it like a
primer no you wipe it off oh it's an
exfoliator reduces pigmentation and skin
imperfections including rough skin bumps
and Ralph
dry patches so yeah you put this on
after you cleanse your face and then you
rinse it off as well so this is a rinse
off exfoliator not like an AJ or a VHA
or anything like that so very cool I
will try that why not and the last thing
in here I'm actually very excited about
I'm assuming a lipstick but what does it
say
it's a douche it's do you CC e or do Qi
I don't know
Cosmetics mineral matte lipstick and in
the full-size which is this is $20 this
is the new york-based color brand
introduce this uniquely textured stuff
talk soft soft oh boy soft touch
lipstick which leaves behind a rich
velvet matte finish has SPF 10 vitamin E
and this is a pretty pink shade it says
oh it is a pretty pink shade oh yes
mmm feels really dry it was like tugging
at my skin such a pretty color though
here I want to show you what I mean so
I'm trying to it's like why does that
look like a completely different color
no it doesn't it's like it's cut yes it
does this looks almost like an orange
and that's like pink when it's layered
so it's like I don't know I'm just being
crazy but it is I don't know how to
describe this texture it feels dry but I
don't think it actually is and like they
said it's a unique texture it's I don't
know but it's such a pretty color I
can't wait to try this so cool the
packaging is really cute on this too it
doesn't feel heavy like a lot of
expensive lipsticks are and this is $20
you would think it would feel a little
heavier than this it's really light
which is fine but just something I
noticed but so that was everything in
the boxycharm I was really excited about
this lipstick and the nail polish and
the hairspray
I'm not since right now I'm in the
middle of kind of switching out my
skincare routine and I'm really trying
to test out this group of products then
I'll be doing a video on soon I'm not
wanting to try a ton of skincare right
this second but I will save these to try
soon so that's what within the foxy
charm that was a good one too I cannot
wait to see what is in the box each arm
so glossy box is $21 and so is boxycharm
so this is a
great to compare these two especially
since they are the same price to kind of
design what would be more up here Ali
for what you would want if you're
spending 21 dollars a month on it so the
theme of this one is bold and beautiful
I'm seeing some of these things that I'm
really excited so here's what I will say
about boxycharm versus glossy box in my
short experience with GlossyBox
I've noticed that boxycharm has a lot
more full size than glassy pucks
GlossyBox has at least in the past two
months especially just glancing at the
baggage charm there's a lot of full-size
things in here that look amazing whereas
with the glossy box it was kind of hit
or miss so let's go ahead and dig in the
first thing in here is this body ography
brow trio interesting okay really cute
packaging it's like a pewter no not a
pewter like a dark it's not quite black
though it's almost like a brownish I
can't describe it like a bronze and it's
it's all powder and they're a trio of
brow products so oh they're way more
pigmented that I thought so those are
the three colors here they are here so
that one would probably be closest to me
that's supposed to be like a highlight
right under your brow bone and then of
course that's a little bit more
chocolatey but yeah I really like this
one it's very taupe topi I was going to
make a joke open now right anyway so
that could actually be really really
nice so I'm excited to give this a try
this one the retail price for this is
$19 so Wow Wow
and there of course they're all matte
because that would be weird you're
putting shimmer in your brows in my
opinion it would be weird but it also
says it comes
yeah the brow brush is by body ography
as well this one is also $19 it does
feel really well made though so it's
just like my honest Asya one where it's
got the spoolie on one in and the very
detailed angle brush on the other these
are fantastic and this feels very well
made compared to like the elf ones I
have which are good but you can tell the
difference this feels really nice so I'm
excited to give this a try using the
brush to moving on okay so this next one
I'm smiling because of everything that's
left is awesome this is the Lauren B
Beauty nail polish and I've gotten one
of these
for but it was in a read that I really
wouldn't wear it was like a blood-red
and she's not my style but this one's
$18 and what color is this Sunset
Boulevard makes me think the musical
it's like a bright coral and on the
camera I think it's coming off a little
more red than it is but it really is
like a well it's one of a watermelon
coral like if you mix the two
I like that I'll probably wear that a
lot this summer because it's such a fun
bright color
next up oh my gosh I'm so excited about
these last two so this one is a Monaco
bronze shimmer bronzing powder and it is
a straight-up full-size first of all I
love the way model code does their
packaging I think it is so fun and cute
oh I just love it
so this one retails for $22 that it is
the full size and it certainly is a
bronzer not a contour shade in my
opinion and it's got shimmer because
it's a bronzing shimmer let me find a
good spot for this so you can kind of
see it really is more orange tone but
it's like light bronze so for me even
though in the pan it looks kind of
almost scary in actuality it's actually
a really nice bronzy color and I think
this will actually work I just said
actually a lot to stop it really nicely
with fair skin like I've got I am so
excited this is the it's so buttery and
I feel like I've had so many miss
experiences with model Co and I'm so
excited that this one is a hit because
I've had some good things for model Co
but this is the first one that I
genuinely felt like oh my gosh this
feels absolutely high-quality so I'm so
excited about that and the very last
thing in here is what I'm the most
excited about couldn't believe this this
is by the lip bar and I had heard of
them I don't I mean I'm sure from
someone I watch here on YouTube but I
never tried them never really looked up
how expensive they were this lipstick
that I'm about to open his $20
originally so it's way more expensive
than a matte lipstick which is true for
this glossy box one two that was more
than a matte lipstick cost so that's
pretty cool anyway so let's see so it
comes in like its own little velour
packaging or a little pouch I guess I
should say look at the packaging can you
guys see that oh I mean it's like so I
mean I've never want to look
had the coolest and it's like
three-dimensional so when you open it
it's got a little little kiss here and
this is a lip bar but here we go
I just noticed the color it's like
purple what maybe it'll swatch different
let's see oh no it's pretty much purple
man I'm gonna try it anyway because this
could be maybe a wearable purple it's
hard to find and maybe if I could have
cheer it out a little bit because this
is the coolest I was hoping it'd be like
a really awesome everyday color but
regardless I mean I certainly do not
have a purple lipstick so I actually am
kind of excited to try it although part
of me is letdown because I was hoping it
was like a light pink I need to branch
out I know it I know but I mean you when
you know what you like you just you know
what you like I'm a teacher I'm not
gonna wear bright purple but I might
wear bright purple in a video so why not
office packaging so much so I would say
I mean again you can't compare tipsy to
these kids $10 and frankly it's you kind
of held its own this time around because
there were a lot of good things than
that
I think boxycharm takes the cake though
out of the tube for this month we will
see what next month brings last month
I don't think I was able to do them
together because of the timing that they
shipped but this month they whoa I'm
trying to wipe off that liner that came
in the Ipsy bag I just scrubbed like
back and forth four times it's not going
anywhere
what was this this was the bellapierre
gel eyeliner okay so that's amazing like
I literally just scrubbed back and forth
wow that's so awesome it's not gonna be
fun to get off when I'm actually trying
to wipe it off my eyes but hey I mean
that's what I want I wanted to not move
during the day so that gosh I might even
wear them on my wedding if it stays that
well that was awesome so all in all I
love subscription boxes I know a lot of
you guys do too if you enjoy them as
much as I do I can put my playlist of
all the other subscription boxes that
I've done on my channel below definitely
subscribe if you enjoyed it I will catch
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
