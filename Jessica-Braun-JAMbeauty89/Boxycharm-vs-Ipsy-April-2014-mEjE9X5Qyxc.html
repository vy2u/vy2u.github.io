have an Ipsy versus boxycharm box
because ever since I cancelled my
Birchbox subscription I can't really do
the Ipsy versus Birchbox
and I thought you know what I always do
an Ipsy video and I always do a
boxycharm video why not put those
head-to-head against each other so the
only difference would be that they don't
cost the same so that's something that
it's certainly worth mentioning so you
know and of course there's info down
below with links if you're curious about
either one of these programs so if she
always comes in a pink little thing and
it always has a makeup bag and it's $10
a month boxycharm is $21 a month however
a lot of times you get more in here or
even if you don't get more it's always
higher-end so I'm excited to show you
guys what came in both of these boxes so
a nipsey's the theme was they always
have it on a card
the theme was well Beauty rocks so it's
got kind of a rock and roll theme and
this is the bag kind of cute it's um
they always it's like some months it's
really well made and sometimes it's not
this one's kind of in between
it feels really thin but I like the
zipper if that makes any sense probably
it doesn't okay so the first thing that
I see here is this packet and it's an
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
so it looks like it's in let me pull it
out it's in the shade black velvet Wow
and it's one of their you know it's not
the full size but it's still pretty good
size assuming that the pencil actually
goes down to the bottom but I've never
had one of these Urban Decay ones I
don't think wow that's certainly black
is black and of course the packaging is
cute it's actually you know some caps
for eyeliners are kind of crappy this
one's really nice like it's not gonna
crack or anything if you push it too far
so really like that and holy crap I
would pay $10 just for this so to get it
with other stuff that's pretty so
waiting okay another thing in here is
this Mary Kay at play jelly lip gloss
and it's in the shade it says berry me
I'm surprised to see
Mary Kay in these because that's it's
kind of a catalog makeup type of you
know about Mary Kay well if you do you
know what I'm talking about so it's
interesting to see it one of these but
it's this lip gloss it's in a squeezy
tube I'm just not a really big fan of it
but the formula might be really nice but
this I'm gonna swatch it but this might
find its way into my giveaway drawer
because it's just kind of a sheer
pinkish red I mean it's it's nice it
feels a little sticky and thick but I
don't really mind when lip glosses are
sticky you know but I don't know how
much you said would actually get out of
this because it's not I don't know which
is not something I usually use so we'll
see the next thing in here is this pop
goes the shadow and it's Elizabeth Mott
premium eye shadow it's a single and
it's in the shade champagne it's a zoo
okay so it's this all does it yeah it
kind of looks like ooh okay that's
really buttery look at that color
I'm gonna kind of double swatch it cuz
I'm fair so it's hard to see it you just
do you guys see it there it's really
really shimmery and beautiful whoo I'm
feeling this is gonna be in my everyday
makeup drawer like right now probably
use it tomorrow that's really pretty
okay another thing in here is this dr.
Brandt microdermabrasion skin exfoliant
so it's a decent size I wonder how full
it actually is who knows but it's point
to five ounces that's not bad it's
always nice to get to try I got another
dr. Brandt product that I haven't tried
I think it was from Ipsy and it was
their primer so I need to try both of
these really but awesome another thing
in here is this Jasmine roll-on perfume
oil hmm
that smells like jasmine well of course
it should but it smells amazing if you
like the smell of jasmine you're gonna
fall in love with this oh my gosh and
how perfect for spring I'm sure that was
on purpose but oh it just makes me so
happy
you know those smells that just make you
happy this is one for me oh my gosh so
that is amazing now I
some points I could trade in for
referring friends to get some other
things and they had both of these
available and so it's this Tokyo milk
dark and they're both lip balms but one
is in salted caramel caramel that's how
the car around my what is wrong with me
caramel or caramel however you want to
say it oh my gosh it smells like yeah
it's just a sheer lip balm but a lot of
product in here this is like whiter than
most little lip puffs that I get and the
other one is in the scent la vie and
rose Oh rose if I can get it open I hate
ones like this cuz I really there we go
oh wow that one really smells like rose
but again it's not colored it's just
clear oh these are really cool though I
think out of the two smell wise I like
the salted caramel one but I'm really
excited so that's all that came in it
that was pretty awesome for ten dollars
I had been met
I'd like an Ipsy almost never
disappoints now let's dig into the
boxycharm so like I said this one is $21
a month but kind of across the board
it's usually higher-end so and I have
been if you've been watching my past
boxycharm videos I saw more and more in
love with it every single month so this
theme is strike a pose and it's got all
the info on the back of the things Wow
okay the first thing I see is this huge
thing it's this cool way finishing oil
for your hair and it has a pump oh
that's awesome I need to get the shrink
wrap off of it but it's the brand if the
brand is cool way cool ways
glow finishing oil it's got vitamin E
and poor for a seaweed extract so it's
supposed to make your hair beautiful and
shiny throughout the day yeah so this is
great because I actually have another
light hair oil I was about to open but
maybe I'll open this one first
cuz I'm excited and I love I just think
the packaging is really cute don't you
guys holy crap and that's straight-up
full-size and the original price for
this is 29.95 for this side whoa the
next thing I Spy is this lip not look
polish nail polish by bellapierre and
it's this really pretty color it's in
the shade aqua teal I've never tried any
of their nail polishes the bellapierre
nail polishes can you guys tell them
sweating look
see the little curls it's hot here now
which is awesome but I'm starting if you
ever noticed that it's probably because
I'm sweating because I've got little
curls my hair is naturally curly anyway
so yes let's see the original price of
this one is $15 genies for this it's
really pretty and I don't know that I
have this color in any nail polish so
that'll be nice
the next thing is this lip I was gonna
say lip gloss but it says it's a liquid
lipstick in the shade of Hollywood and
it's at the brand Ofra now I got one of
these before from them and it was ok but
it was a color I had never used so I
ended up getting rid of it but that it
smells great it smells like cake batter
and the color is really pretty but the
its it is a similar formula to the
Rimmel apocalypse or the what do they
call them year in the same the ones I
have
it's called apocalypse everywhere else
but what does it called here oh my gosh
Rimal you know what I'm talking about
very similar formula but kind of goopy
err the other ones a little bit smoother
but this is a little bit goopy but it's
supposed to stain for 5 hours is what it
says so that color is absolutely
gorgeous so I'm I'm gonna give it a shot
even though it's weird and goopy and
makes a weird noise when you close it
listen alright alright alright okay two
more things
oh the original price for that by the
way is nineteen ninety jeez what a good
year that was I was turning one that
year okay
the next product is this I pencil by
model Co and that loved model Coast
packaging it's just white and it usually
has pink riding on it I'm not sure if
that's focusing or showing up but it's
just all cute I love the white but it
has a sharpener in it and sometimes that
kind of drives me nuts just because the
sharpener gets dirty and then you get to
like clean up before you throw it in a
makeup bag or at least I feel like I
should and sometimes they don't stay on
as well right now this is shrink-wrapped
but oh now I've opened it let's swatch
it oh so that's it
wow it's blacker right here it's blacker
then that was the Urban Decay one so hmm
it is black black black that's awesome
well I wonder about the staying power of
this versus that Urban Decay one but
really nice in the original
price of this one is $18 and even the
boxes are cute I just think that cute
nothing that really matters but hey it
certainly doesn't hurt the last thing oh
I'm excited about this is a model Co
blush oh my gosh and this is all of
these are full-size I don't know if I
said that which is usually the case
almost all of the products are always
full size with boxycharm this is eight
to 18 dollars originally and it's a
blush and I love blush I'm so excited oh
yeah they should this is like a fall
color
it's called amaretto sunset amaretto is
one of my favorite word's do you ever
have favorite words that just sound
beautiful to you amaretto is such a
beautiful word to me in a beautiful
flavor and scent okay this doesn't have
a smell I was I was very hopeful this is
a very deep beautiful color but I just
wish it was wow it was given to me in
the fall because I would have loved to
have worn this last fall so I'll
certainly be wearing it this fall and
any time of year but it's a beautiful
fall winter color in the packaging again
it's just so cute and trendy isn't it
uh-huh
I love that so quickly doing the math
here and kind of rounding this is 105
it's over $100 worth of products and it
costs $21 for all of these so certainly
certainly worth your money especially
since all of these are gonna be useful
to me there's not a single whereas with
the if C which I really liked this month
a lot but out of all of them I think
like the lip gloss I'm probably not
going to use the shadow I will use the
the perfume oil I just love so I'll find
a way to use the exfoliant I wish it
were more full-sized you know it's nice
to try it but I love that like with
boxycharm
they straight-up gave me a full size of
this hair oil and this is $30 straight
up so you know you kind of take it with
a grain of salt and just know that the
cons you turn because you're paying more
you're getting more so that's another
thing you have to keep in mind so my
suggestion would be if you're currently
getting like if your view of like two
subscription boxes right now and they're
both like 10 or $15 apiece you can
easily get boxycharm cancel both of
those and get back to charm 420 and its
really really good Pro I don't
clearly I like boxycharm and I know but
I love fc2 and I can't imagine canceling
that one ever just like Birchbox I was
like cut the cord sorry Bertie but
however I will say I've been getting
things off their website because they'll
offer free shipping and they have a lot
of options on there so I still use
Burke's box's website to buy makeup and
beauty items but I just don't subscribe
to the box but anyway here anyway I hope
that was helpful for you guys let me
know if you're subscribed to either one
of these or if you've if you're
subscribed to a box maybe I've never
even featured or heard up I would love
to hear about it cuz there's so many out
there that are all kind of different in
their own way and I love that about it
so let me know down below and I'll catch
you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
