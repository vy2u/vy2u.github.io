going to do my MC vs. boxycharm for
January you guys I haven't gotten my
boxycharm in month the Sun months now
they sent it to me complimentary so I
couldn't really complain you know what I
mean
but I context them and said hey remember
me what happened they're like oh sorry
you can get the next one I'm like
alright thanks I mean I could pay for it
what you'd be awesome but you guys know
I love reviewing these for you guys on
my channel because I love subscription
boxes I mean truly love them but these
are two of my favorites so I love
comparing them even though they're not
the same price but just in the realm of
subscription boxes these are two of my
favorite so I just always throw them
into the same video if C is $10 a month
boxycharm is $21 a month however you
will see typically boxycharm has a lot
if not all full-size products and like a
lot of high-end products so I'm excited
to see what's in it especially since I
haven't had it in the past few months I
can't really complain because I get it
for free to review so I mean you know I
know I'm being silly I hope you guys
know that I'm being silly you guys know
that I'm being silly right okay you guys
need to let me know if I've got lipstick
on my teeth because every time I wear
these it seems to happen right now I'm
testing out the Rimmel showoff matte lip
velvet and it's in the shade meteoric
matte and I keep seeing it like all my
teeth do you let me know if it's on my
teeth alright so if C will start with
like I said it's $10 a month and it
always has a little makeup bag with it
so oh oh so I also cashed in some hip C
points if you refer friends or if you
review products on there you get points
that you can cash in for free things and
it looks like I've got a few of those in
this so oh three things so the like
theme is fresh start this is a kick-off
so clean the possibilities are endless
get ready for a fantastic and flawless
2015 awesome so the bag is blue and
white and orange which i think is kind
of a fun combo reminds me of the night
in the early 90s and then that fun maybe
in the 80s
so that's kind of fun it feels a little
more well-made than a lot of there so
that is nice so the first thing I'm
seeing is the melanin gets mojito lip
balm
it says daily protection soothing
treatment fatty acid absorption
technology so mojito I wonder if it
smells like it hmm
it smells minty so yeah a little bit
so it feels really really like vaseline
like which I really like in a lip balm
especially if I'm doing it like I'll put
on lip balm before I start my makeup so
by the time I'm done my lips are super
moisturized or at night before I go to
bed so I'm excited about this one the
next one is a liquid eyeliner in jet is
the color and it's from Coastal Scents
so and on the side there's a sticker and
it's not even a sticker it says 25% off
for if Seebeck subscribers or really for
anyone if you have the code the code is
liner 25 off at checkout I don't know if
it's only good for this or what or for
their liners let's see I use liquid
liner everyday I kind of do a triple
layer I do like pencil liner I know it
sounds ridiculous pencil liner then gel
liner and then liquid liners I just do I
don't know I always have so it's in one
of these kind of doodads and I haven't
used one like this in a long time
so let's see
you can certainly be very precise I'm
wondering if you can do a really thick
line - yeah so it seems super black like
I said it's in the shade jet so that's a
good thing um okay not bad at all
I probably will use it and I I don't
keep like liners I just go through like
especially liquid ones I just use these
up like they don't sit around in my
collection for long so I will definitely
get some use out of that that is for
sure the next thing in the bag is this
Pacifica ooh natural mineral coconut
eyeshadow I was just at this store
called fresh time and I don't know if
they're all over the nation or where
they are but they sell a lot of Pacifica
products and I was watching them and
falling in love with them so I'm excited
to get one so this is in the shade
ethereal I said it right and ooh it's
like this really really pretty well just
kind of off-white color that looks
really really beautiful oh yeah oh my
gosh that is the most beautiful lid
color I will certainly use that I love
ethereal is a great name for it kind of
heavenly almost or otherworldly I will
definitely use that that's a great one
that's just a good one
the next thing I'm seeing is this Pro
Bell nail lacquer and it's this kind of
interesting blue it's all it's I don't
really know how to describe that looks a
little brighter on camera than it does
in person in person it's a little more
muted which is kind of cool almost like
light jeans in a way it's in the shade
into the blue and that's pretty I let's
see how you know opaque it is it looks
kind of opaque that would definitely
need at least two coats
I'm just based on looking at the brush
the fact that you can kind of see
through the brush yeah I mean I'll use
it I think it's a really pretty one
that'll be pretty in the spring and
summer especially the last thing in this
bag cuz these always come with five
things is oh it's an Elizabeth moth
all-over shadow brush it's all pink and
cute it's a little shorter than most
brushes are oh it feels pretty well made
sometimes brushes like this that
these are not the best but it just it
feels really soft and yeah I mean I'll
certainly use this is a great shader
brush so the three things I got with it
with my like reward points the first
thing is this jcat and I hear everyone
talk about J cat cuz it's always in
subscription boxes but I don't know that
I've ever received anything from J cat
but it looks like one of them it says
it's really dark it's hard to read
wonder lip paint so I think this is
supposed to be similar to like an OCC
lip tar where these crazy thick lip
paints that you can mix and make
different colors or do whatever you want
with this is a crazy dark color it's in
red potion so we're gonna see if it
comes out this color or if it's a little
lighter or what so it's still pretty
dark oh well looks like um I mean that's
pretty dark let's swatch with what's
left on my hands still really dark I
mean it looks like you can blend it out
to be more of a berry color so of course
I just applied a ton you wouldn't need
that many will I ever wear this well
maybe I would like to say no but I mean
it's similar ish to what I'm wearing on
my lips now so I guess I might wear it
but it seems like it'd be so much work
to apply that I don't know that would be
worth it the next thing that I got from
those points is this NYX butter lip balm
I might go ahead and pass this on now
it's in red velvet but I just did my
declutter and I got rid of another shade
of this just because it's not that
they're bad I just don't really need any
more right now in a red balm I know that
I'm not gonna wear so I'm not even gonna
open it I'm gonna pass it on because
just knowing that I just decluttered the
other one for the same reason I don't
feel the need to hold on to this one for
now so okay the next thing is this
bumble and bumble prepare to be blown
away repair blow dry serum in cream to
repair hair with every blow dry so it
sounds like it's kind of like a blow
drying cream or like a heat protectant
cream which is nice the bumble a bubble
of course is really really expensive so
that's nice okay so moving on to the box
each are
these always come of course in a box so
let's see the first thing on top is
their card and it says celebrate in
style cheers to a new year charmers the
best is yet to come and we're ringing it
in by celebrating in style with a little
make-up join us in celebrating by
sharing ok yeah yeah yeah so on the back
I love this it gives the prices in the
descriptions of everything in there so
usually retails like in the end for like
$100 I don't know how they do it and
like still make money on the deal but
whatever the first thing on top it looks
like these are those like foil or what a
metallic like fake tattoo things let me
see yeah flash tattoo that's what
they're called it's the purely skin
sparkle flash tattoos it's just one
sheet this retails for $12 so this would
be fun to wait until summer and even
then I don't know if I well I'm gonna
keep it and see if I will just cuz we're
gonna be at our honeymoon most likely in
Europe and it just might be fun you know
if we're like on the Mediterranean I
have no idea so we'll see if I actually
do otherwise I'll pass them on if I
don't use them past summer but it's
really pretty I mean it's a fun concept
if you haven't seen flash tattoos in
action they they're all over Pinterest
if you type it in or just Google search
they look beautiful I'm really tan skin
on pale skin like mine I don't know that
they'd be as cute but you know so that's
kind of fun the next thing in here is
this Mirabella product and what is it
says prime for face let's see about that
oh it's a long tube
mirabela prime for face not again and it
doesn't say anything but ingredients so
on here let's see what it says
if this is the full size and it retails
for $29 it says infuse your skin with
vitamin E while minimizing pores and
fine lines with the silky face primer
avoid the lash line it says interesting
and then it says use sparingly what so
should I not use this everyday or do
they mean just don't use a lot I would
assume it just means don't use a lot I
don't know so I I kind of like the tube
and I like that it's thinner most
primers are light either in giant pumps
which take up a ton of room for about
the same amount of product so for me I
travel a lot so let's just see what this
is like here it's a
clear primer so it's probably similar to
a lot of the ones I already have oh yeah
blends out to be very very silky that
silicone feeling gosh does feel silky er
than the ones I have though wow it
almost looks shiny though do you guys
see that so I don't I don't know if
that's gonna transfer on the face
although that could look really pretty
under a mattifying foundation end up
like it'll like add that shininess under
it so it'll be like a satin finish so
this is one that I actually will try I
don't I feel like I get rid of so many
Mirabella products that I don't even try
them and I don't really know why I do
that because they're expensive but I
mean given what I do I've got a lot of
everything so I'm actually gonna keep
this and try this because I don't know
it just it's seems nice and like I said
I like the packaging it'd be so much
easier for me to travel with if I end up
liking it alright the next thing in here
is this VFR beauty for real the perfect
pencil lip enhancer and it says not
tested on animals good that's all it
says just beauty for real on here let's
see what it says it says this is the
full-size and it's $14 for this the only
lip liner you'll ever need this special
shade complements and enhances the
natural shape of your lips for the
perfect pout line your lips and pair
with your favorite lipstick or gloss so
well let's just see how universal this
is we're gonna use it on top of this
primer it does feel like it you know
what it looks like sore from Mac well
this is a little more Brown but you know
I know everyone's going for that look
I'm not gonna say who it looks like but
everyone's going for that kind of color
and this looks a lot like it so that is
pretty cool it feels a little dry I mean
I think you guys can kind of see how dry
that looks but I'm not - a lot of times
I kind of like a drier lip liner because
when I've got a lip liner that's the
retractable that's really creamy it ends
up not doing its job of holding
everything inside the lines if you will
so when it's super creamy I find that
it's going outside the lines just like
my lipstick is so it kind of defeats the
purpose so I don't mind that this is a
little drier I am feeling
actually use this a lot because it's a
really it is a neutral color it's a
little deeper but again I don't mind
that so cool I mean certainly in style
right now to the next thing in here is
again from beauty for real and it's
their lip cream ooh feels heavy oh it
feels very heavy this is like a heavier
packaging which I like so it has a
mirror where you can it said has a
sticker that you can peel off it says
true color lip cream the shade is always
there and it retails for $22 this is the
full-size it says your lips only better
this color enhances and defines your lip
color for a gorgeous natural look okay
oh it's a light oh it's got a little
light inside like inside the I'm gonna
blind you guys so you can see what
you're doing you know Wow
so this looks like let me turn this
little light off a lot of its really
gimmicky but at the same time it
actually is kind of useful so oh this is
kind of a similar shade to it those
would go well together I like this even
better this is just a pretty rose color
I really like that color and the
packaging is simple and cute and it's
got a little mirror light for all your
mirror and light needs you know cuz
we're always putting on lip gloss in the
back of a dark van so funny but you know
you never know what you might need it
that is a really pretty color and it
feels creamy oh is that the smell of
that hold up oh no this just smells like
nothing really I think that primer is
what I'm smelling let me smell this
primer it's got kind of this soft like
laundry smell the primer does that's a
awesome it smells really good so very
excited about this lip gloss so there's
one more big thing in here which I'm
really excited about I'm kind of seeing
it and I'm like oh my gosh but in there
there's a card this is Tarte 20% off
your purchase on Tarte calm the code is
Boxey jan as in January JN and it's good
from February 3rd to February 12th so if
you're wanting to buy some from Tarte
for 20% off that's pretty awesome
so this huge thing is it is tar oh my
gosh this is well this is definitely
full-sized it's the mayor Kuja bronzing
serum I think I saw this in someone's
video and I was like what oh wow I just
pulled everything up Wow
so it is a straight-up full-sized
maracuja bronzing serum so is this the
kind where how does this work
oh yes that's right it's an oil and
there's like a button on the top that
you push to let the oil fall out and
from what I hear if I remember you like
mix this with your lotion to make it a
bronzing lotion which is so flippin cool
let's read what it says so woah this
retails for forty-seven dollars
what okay it says hydrate and even your
skin tone to help find signs of aging
for aging for a firmer brighter
appearance the gradual self tanning
complex delivers instant radiance as it
naturally bronzes for a healthy glowing
complexion how to so you dispense two to
three drops of the serum in your hands
and apply to clean dry skin oh so you
don't mix with your lotion you just
apply it to clean dry skin on the face
and neck oh so maybe if you've been
self-tanning like everywhere else and
you wanted your face to match and you
don't want to use your self-tanner on
your face you can use this that is
pretty cool I actually you know in the
spring and summer I usually do use at
least like natural glow or things like
that where I do get a little more color
without actually being in the Sun and
getting color so that may actually be
really nice to add a little bit I'm very
interested I think when it gets to that
time of year I might do like a demo or
first impressions with this just because
I think it will be funny because I will
probably not know how to do with it but
I also think it might be helpful to just
kind of see how it works because it's
such an odd concept really so that is
really really cool so overall if I had
to pick a winner I mean it seems no it's
not always boxycharm but I mean come on
this is like a fifty dollar product that
I would never buy for myself but if you
were wanting to spend $20 on a
subscription box you want to trust that
you're going to be getting full-size
products so
if it's five product and you break it
down to you know twenty twenty divided
by five that's four bucks a piece for
all of these different things I mean you
cannot beat that but most of all I think
I'm really excited about I'm really
excited about all of these other than
the flash tattoos with Ipsy I'm really
excited about the shadow and the lip
balm because it smells minty which I
love the line or two because I I just
use liquid liner so for me that's useful
and I love that it's black and it's not
in some weird like green color that I'm
only gonna use a few times so I'm really
excited about that as well the polish is
pretty but I mean it's I don't know I
mean polish is polish but it is pretty
and I'll use it and the brush is nice
I've got plenty but if you were someone
that you're trying to build up your
collection any subscription box is great
for that and Ipsy a lot of times we'll
send a brush which is kind of nice if
you're building up your brush collection
overall I love subscription boxes if you
do to definitely subscribe I've got all
kinds that I'm always uploading and I
can link below my subscription box
playlist if you want to see just a ton
of them being unboxed I do all different
kinds this is of course this makeup
focus but I also do one that I love
called try the world which is like a
travel food box which I love I'm hoping
to kind of infuse some more different
subscription boxes I love my tea and
coffee ones as well so definitely check
those out and subscribe and I'll catch
you guys in the next one bye the wear
time on this I would say is pretty darn
good I would say it would last all day I
don't think you need to reapply I mean I
don't know anyone that reapplies their
foundation
anyway but I think that it does a really
great job I did not use a prime
underneath it the wear time would be
even better if I did but I really wanted
to see how it would work just on my skin
as it is with just a moisturizer
underneath so I was impressed with how
well at war it doesn't it didn't break
up or anything weird didn't oxidize I
mean I am super impressed with this
foundation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
