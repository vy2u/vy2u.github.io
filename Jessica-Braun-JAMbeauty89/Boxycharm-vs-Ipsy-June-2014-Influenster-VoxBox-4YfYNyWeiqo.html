versus boxycharm for you and I also have
an influencer voxbox that I figure I
would throw into this video as well so
let's go ahead and start with the IPPS
llevarse boxycharm since that's why most
of you are here and then if you want to
stay tuned at the end I'll show what is
in the Influenster box so let's start
with the if see one it's always in its
trademark pink little bag or box or bag
okay so well is there a little blue blue
so it seems $10 a month and hopefully
it's got like a little thing okay first
of all oh my gosh this makeup bag though
this is so cute this okay if she's been
killing it with their makeup bags last
month's one that was the canvas one I
loved this one is adorable it's got like
this kind of wine print but like the
darker colors it's Rebecca Minkoff of
course it's cute so that is pretty
awesome I'm assuming they teamed up with
Rebecca Minkoff for this bag there's the
sheet that I want so it always comes
with the sheet the theme is pretty in
paradise so there's that okay so the
first thing I'm seeing is well what is
this a I'm assuming it's a perfume it
says real tree for her
do you oh okay I'm just gonna risk it
please smell good please smell good
please smell good what
it smells awesome
it reminds me of something I don't know
what but so it's the real treat for her
Oh de parfum I really like the packaging
on this that it's um even though it's
just kind of a trial size that it's got
the spray nozzle but it has a lid for it
it's really nice if you're traveling
with it because there's nothing worse
than having just the sprayer and it
getting all over the place so I look
different today
looking at myself I just look like odd
am i okay anyway so that smells really
nice I'm excited about that
ooh the next thing I'm okay it's a marc
anthony dream wave speech spray and it
says it creates sexy tousled beach waves
all year long it's just a classic spray
nozzle you can use it on damp or dry
hair scrunch it to amplify the wavy
texture allow allow to dry naturally for
a soft finish or high-voltage way to use
the diffuser while scrunching yes so
just like a classic one again great for
traveling and this these really even
though they're called beach braid you
can ear use them year round I really do
like being at the beach and using a
spray like this like after you know when
you're going out at night you don't
really want to do your hair because it's
humid and hot where you are and you know
you've been on the beach all day this is
just such a really nice thing to just
kind of throw in your hair I just I mean
I don't know about this I never tried
this brand but you know the next thing
what is this in Oprah or offer brand
eyebrow it says it's a universal eyebrow
pencil so that's kind of cool I know
there's a lot of companies that are now
coming out with these and gosh though I
mean even with the lightest touch I feel
like well I don't know I don't feel like
this could totally be universal but it
might work for me I mean just because I
happen to be brunette but still think
that's cool what I'm excited to give it
a try because I have not found anything
that even compares to the mustachio brow
Wiz but what is this be a bombshell
cosmetics this is their lash out mascara
now I've gotten mascaras from them no
let me rephrase I've gotten the Obamas
shell products from them all the time
and it's kind of for me hit hit or miss
like I kept getting that cheek stain
thing
and it never worked well for my skintone
I don't know why but so I'm excited to
give this a try I have a few mascaras on
back up so I don't know how soon I'll
get around to this but I mean mascara
certainly gets used I know that much and
the last thing in the bag is this NYX
butter gloss yes in creme brulee I have
been wanting to try one of these this is
just this really nice kind of nude paint
color creme brulees are really actually
a great name for this but these are ones
that I've been wanting to try and I
never actually get they smell like
vanilla cupcakes it's amazing but I
never buy them so I'm so glad this
worked out so well now the last thing
that I got with my Ipsy thing is you can
get when you review the products that
you get you get oopsy points and also
when you refer friends so you can
exchange them for freebies that they'll
have every once a while up on that
channel channel you know what I mean on
the site I was able to get the full
size.you a lip gloss in peony and it's
just this really beautiful blue tone
Barbie pink color and the packaging is
just cute and little but it is a full
size I thought oh my gosh that's such a
good deal then they actually had two
different colors I was gonna get both
but the other one was like sold out if
you will even though you weren't buying
it but it was sold out but this one
wasn't I was really excited those of
that one that alone made me so excited
but this didn't come in like the regular
bag you had to use the points for it so
regardless this was pretty awesome for
ten dollars I mean are you kidding the
NYX butter gloss alone is like five so
it is bag I love so so far it's II
killed it next we've got our boxycharm
which you guys know I love as well this
one's more expensive I'll have all the
info down below for all of this stuff so
the first thing okay it says bridal
beauty June is a month for weddings we
think there's nothing more beautiful
than a gorgeous bride yes yes yes okay
so it's got all the stuff there so first
of all the first thing I see is this
Tarte card for 20% off you can use the
code boxycharm 14 so all but it's only
valid like in parts of July so it's not
valid until July 7th so it's up to keep
in mind abut that's really nice and then
it says finally a mascara you'll love
while giving you a special chance to try
it so there's a coupon so I'm so yep
first thing I'm seeing is that mascara
this is the Revlon bolt lacquer by girl
luscious lengthen Volume Mascara now
I've tried just the girl luscious that's
in kind of like the more like rainbow
packaging almost and it was okay it
wasn't my favorite but it wasn't the
worst so I would be interested to try
this I like that it's in blackest black
and it is not waterproof so I think for
me that would work well just we'll see
how the formula is but it looks like the
brush is uh if you look at this card
here looks like the brush is pretty
normal there which is kind of nice next
thing oh okay this is good
I'm really excited this is the Terina
Terrence you know I dream hyper liner
color isn't it
Oh cute robot oh it's like a blue oh my
gosh so it's like this kind of
iridescent navy blue color and the
packaging is adorable all of Terina
tarantino's packaging it's just cute
like this one's pretty simple but it
just always has this touch of just I
don't know just adorable so that's a win
the next thing I'm seeing is also Trina
Tarantino and what is this the iDream
hyper light under eye brightener okay
there we go
like it look again the packaging is
adorable
it certainly has a salmon color to it
that is for sure but that can be
fantastic under your eyes so I'm really
excited to give this a try I kind of
want to wipe it all off so I don't get
it all in the cap I think I could just
wasted a ton but again the packaging is
adorable it looks like a nice formula
and an interesting color I don't know it
might almost be too pink for a lot of
skin tone so that's another thing you
know regardless the next thing I'm
seeing is this strange beautiful nail
polish duo now I've got one of these
before and they were in colors that I
didn't like but these are actually
colors I might wear they're just so
pretty so the last thing in here really
excited about this is the Tarte cheek
stain in blushing bride and the
packaging of the Tarte things are just
so cute and let's just go through shall
we because that was everything that was
in this one this is kind of insane it's
hard
cheat scene is $30 and this is the
full-size so that alone is like freaking
baller the I dream hyper liner which is
that terena Tarantino blue eyeliner was
$15 and that's the full-size the terena
Tarantino concealer the brightener was
$22 for that full-size the nail lacquer
set is 18 and the Revlon mascara of
course is like $7.99 I mean that's one
of this so so when you add all those up
that is 93 dollars worth of products for
21 dollars every month boxycharm eats
better now if I had to pick between the
two this month the Ipsy or the boxycharm
I don't think I can I'm probably the
Boxster I'm but then again the Box term
is more expensive so you kind of in my
head I'm like well it better be better
because it was you know essentially
double the price of the $10 if see bags
I actually I'm excited to try every
single thing that I got what a good
month for a subscription box that is
very exciting to me so that was awesome
now if you would like to see what's in
the Influenster box I will open that now
now this is the here's our go up this is
the vow box box of which the I guess the
idea behind it was if you're getting
married or in a serious relationship or
something now I'm not engaged or
anything like that so it was just kind
of funny that I was chosen for this but
I was like whatever I mean okay I'll
take the box for free of course so it
was just kind of interesting but it has
the breakdown of what's in here so the
first thing I'm seeing is this Ecotools
pure complexion facial facial sponge and
this is the stuff that's maybe with that
cognac fiber or cognac I don't really
know I'm assuming it's cognac but I
loved mine that I got from dr. sponge so
I'm excited to try the Ecotools version
because these are a little more readily
available to me where I live so I'm
really excited to try this this is the
kind of sponge that's really hard when
you first get it and once it's dried out
but then you get it wet and it softens
and then you use it to kind of mildly
exfoliate your face and kind of clean
your face off and then when you hang it
back up to kind of dry it just drives
back to the hardened form until you use
it
stay so really really like those but you
do have to replace them ever you know
I'm replacing like every month I don't
like using it for very long I think it
says you can keep them one to three
months so I don't know about three
months but I mean you probably can
anyway the next thing I'm seeing is this
tide to go instant stain remover always
useful I remember back in the day when
they first came out with these I would
always get stains on them you know the
classic white shirt and I would use it
and then there'd be like an even weirder
stain like all around where I used it so
I remember being very turned off by
these initially but I'm assuming the
formulas gotten better and it's better
than it was hopefully so excited to give
that a try again and it'll just be a
nice thing to have with you in your
purse I never have one it would be nice
or maybe in my desk in my teachers desk
the next thing I'm seeing aha I already
own this the Sally Hansen complete salon
manicure and it's in the shade Barracuda
this is actually one of my favorite nail
polishes and it's just beautiful it's
one of those blues they it's just as
opaque as it looks it's just beautiful
this formula is one of my favorite
formulas so excited to get this again I
might hit pass this on to my sister who
I think will like it more and buy more I
mean like it as much as I do because I
already own it you know what I'm saying
the next thing I'm seeing this will be
useful the pure silk rich and luxurious
shave cream raspberry miss I don't know
you can't really smell it yet I don't
know if I've ever tried any pure silk
shaving cream so but I do use shaving
cream so it'll be nice to have that'll
be the next one I use Yahoo and the last
thing in here woah this is the Olay
Regenerist luminous tone perfecting
cream an assistant it phased the look of
discoloration and then it also claims
that it fades dark spots in eight weeks
that's interesting I mean it seems like
it'd be I mean the packaging is cute I
know that jar packaging I've been
nerding out on polished choice and this
is like the second time I've already
mentioned it but in another video but
polished choice you can get reviews of
all kinds of skincare of things and kind
of learn more about what's good in
skincare what to look for what to avoid
and things like
especially when you keep in mind your
own skin type but one thing it mentions
on every moisturizer if it's in jar
packaging it really you know the fact
that all this air and light is hitting
it every time you open it and then
you're dipping your fingers into it - it
can really counteract and kind of make
the active ingredients in here and not
work as well so that really makes me sad
that the jar packaging really does
lessen the effect of those ingredients
of some ingredients doesn't mean I'm not
going to try this I'm not going to be a
snob about it but it is one thing to
keep in mind when you guys are looking
for skin care I've been trying to be a
little more conscious with that as well
I might use this I might pass this on to
my mom as well just because I don't
really have dark spots that I'm too
worried about I mean I've got freckles
galore it's not like I'm far from
perfect but I think my mom will like
this more than I will so I might pass
that on to her but pretty nice I do love
Olay products a lot of Olay products I
really really like so that was pretty
cool
I love Influenster if you haven't signed
up you I don't remember if you have to
get invited or not anymore but I think
you could just sign up but basically you
just give them information and you take
surveys on all these different products
or I mean review different products and
over time they'll get to know you and
you get points and then they might ask
you hey we're gonna send you this type
of box or you know so that's how that
happened and you don't get them it's
like you get them every month I feel
like it's every maybe two to three
months maybe less maybe more depending
on how active you are and how active you
are on the site really but I really do
like it every time I get something I
always end up discovering a new favorite
and then there are other things that I
don't like as much but it's usually just
new products anyway I'll shut up I've
been blabbering so I hope that was
helpful for you guys I know that was
chock-full of a lot of different things
but I'm excited to give a lot of these
to try and pass on when I'm not going to
use but I hope you'll subscribe for more
videos and I'll catch you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
