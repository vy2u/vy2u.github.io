share with you guys the things I'm
giving my bridesmaids if you aren't one
of my bridesmaids please click off do
not watch this because you will ruin the
surprise of what you're gonna get so if
you are one of my five please go watch
it affirm video of mine these are some
things that either their old favorites
of mine or they're just things that I
think they will love they're kind of
girly but they're still personal because
one thing that is the worst if you've
ever been a bridesmaid is when the gift
that the bride gives you is something
that like says like their wedding all
over it so you don't necessarily want to
carry it around day-to-day but some of
the best bridesmaid gifts that I've
received have been ones that either like
or personal for me like they had my
initials or something that was useful to
me for every day after that not just on
the day of the wedding so that's kind of
one of the things that as I went into
planning my wedding and thinking about
what I wanted to give my bridesmaids I
wanted to make sure these were things
that were useful to them but I did want
to do some cutesy things that would be
useful the day of as well for some of it
now I was lucky enough that Erin Condren
which you guys know I have loved that
stupid stupid website for so long I call
it a stupid because I've given so much
of my money to that website it's crazy
but I've been so blessed that you guys
have clicked on my referral links in the
past and so I've gotten a lot of
referral credit on there that I've been
able to get some of this stuff and the
media team of there also contacted me
and offered to send me some of their new
personalized kind of bridesmaid z-type
gifts that they were just launching and
I was like yes please goodness yes so I
was so excited and it's actually really
cool stuff so I'm excited to share it
with you guys know this video is not
sponsored they're not paying me anything
to say anything about it but I wanted to
show them to you guys because they are
really cool so let's start with those
things and then I'm gonna lead into the
other things that I've kind of picked
out on my own that I wanted to give each
and every one of them so all of these
things there's like one two three four
five six seven seven eight ish
items they're gonna be in some sort of
basket or something maybe wrapped in
cellophane to give on the night at the
rehearsal dinner but I don't have that
basket yet because I've got a few more
months so this is just what's gonna be
in it so the first thing which I think
is the cutest is a pair of flip-flops
now it's not just any pair of flip-flops
they Erin Condren I mean they like
personalize everything so it's the
initials of each bridesmaid so it's her
initials and you could get like all
matching ones to be like your Bridal
color like on Erin Condren website they
had like a whole matching set of
everything I wanted all of the
flip-flops match but the other things
that you'll see I picked out patterns
that I thought that each individual
bridesmaid would like instead of just
getting one collective matching thing
for everyone I wanted it to be a little
more personal but I did get the same
flip-flops so we could all match and
maybe get a picture together and I got
some for myself too although it was
crazy because of course my initials are
JM but on that day I will become Jessica
bronze would be JB so it was cool to see
that on my flip flops of course I won't
wear them yet but it was just cool
anyway so those are really really cute I
thought that was such a fun idea we can
all wear those like while we're getting
ready in the morning and our receptions
outdoors so if we're tired of wearing
our heels we could totally wear our cue
flip-flops okay so another thing from
Erin Condren this I okay they sent
little like clear bags and what I'm
going to do is fill them with candy
again I've got a few months so I didn't
want to fill it with candy now and then
the candy get all weird what I wanted to
show you are the labels and the labels
that I made on the site say it couldn't
say I do without you and then just my
name so I just thought they were so cute
of course you can put whatever phrase
you want but that's like a classic one
that I think is so sweet and so I'm just
gonna have this filled with candy and
I've got a whole pack of these labels
that you can order and so I think I'm
gonna put them on water bottles for them
as well and maybe a few other things I'm
not sure but I thought that was so cute
and you can have it so that it says you
in the groom's name as well like if it
was from both of you maybe if you were
giving gifts to both the groomsmen
in the bridal party and another errand
conscient thing that I picked out for
them are these cards that have their
name on it so it's like a pack of eight
or ten cards and then you pick out the
color envelope to go with it and it
comes in this cute erin condren bag but
like for one of my sisters she's a mom
of three and married so I had to save
her family name but for some of the
other bridesmaids they're not married so
I just had their name on it but I think
that's a cute gift that they can use for
anything for thank-you cards or just for
anything and it's just I don't know I
thought it was so cute and this is one
that I picked up different patterns for
each and every bridesmaid that were more
fitting to their personality the last
Erin Condren thing that I picked out are
their body butters and it's the scent I
guess is Island Fleur and I have smelled
the stuff and it smells unbelievable it
is just like juicy yummy yummy news
you know it's a summer wedding it's in
June and this is such a summery scent so
I figured this is just kind of a nice
gift they could use that day to put on
their arms whatever it's really really
moisturizing it is kind of pricey in my
opinion for a body butter but I do like
the idea of putting some sort of lotion
or body butter in the basket for them
because they can use it that day if they
want or not it's kind of up to them now
moving beyond just the Erin Condren
stuff so other stuff that I threw in
that are just favorites of mine that I
thought would be useful for them first
thing no one will be surprised if you've
watched me for any length of time the
EOS sweet mint lip balm I don't really
like the EOS oreos lip balms but the
only one I like is the sweet Met kind
it's so it smells like sweet mint and
it's actually moisturizing and it's I
love the color I mean everything about
it is lovely so I bought five of them
for my five different bridesmaids to put
and again they can use it the day off to
get ready and from that on you know
forever
well it'll run out quick because they'll
fall in love with it too and they'll use
it up another thing I threw in are these
Pacifica essential makeup removing wipes
Pacifica actually sent me a ton of
different things which was such a
blessing because they really are nice
and I kind of just split them up and so
I'm giving each of my bridesmaids
one of these or one of the coconut ones
so that is awesome and again use focus
they can remove their makeup at the end
of the day after the reception or
whatever or if they're just wanting to
take off their lipstick maybe that they
wore for the ceremony and they don't
want to necessarily wear for the actual
reception just useful useful useful and
also cute another thing I threw in is
this will anus skin food now I have this
full-size of it right here it is an
amazingly moisturizing thing but the
smell is really strong so I didn't want
to get them these huge ones that were
kind of expensive and then them not like
it so they're these I think they're one
ounce not even 0.34 well geez I thought
these were at least one ounce whatever
but it's a really cute little skin food
and I love this stuff so I'm hoping they
will too and again if they wanted they
could use it then or just put it in
their purse whatever and then the last
thing I'm throwing in there that I know
of so far is a box of my favorite tea
and I think I think what I might do is
put little notes on every single thing
that explain kind of my reasoning kind
of the way I'm explaining to you guys
but with this one it's my favorite tea
and you guys know that but it's such an
amazingly relaxing tea so I figured
maybe I put a note on it that just says
something like you know so that you can
relax after a long day of listening to
me boss you around I don't know you know
something cutie I won't really do that
bossy guys calm down but I love this tea
and I know that they will too so I
thought that was kind of a fun thing to
just throw in just something different
and I do think that I might get some
other things to put in there maybe some
make up B items but makeup is so
personal and all of my bridesmaids are
very different and they all would wear
different so I might go out and get
maybe the same lipstick but a different
shade or maybe I don't know so I might
be throwing in some other things I'd
love to get some ideas from you guys of
things that maybe you gave to your
bridesmaids or just ideas that you have
because I'm certainly open to any and I
would love to add even more because I'm
so thankful for my lovely bridesmaids I
will put links below for I think I can
find links for all this stuff definitely
for the Erin Condren things I can find
links for but I'll find links for all
the other things as well in case you're
wanting these for just yourself or maybe
you're gonna take some
ideas hopefully this video was helpful
for you guys if your wedding planning or
maybe just to have ideas for just some
new things for yourself to try I
certainly have had so much fun putting
things together and I would love to hear
