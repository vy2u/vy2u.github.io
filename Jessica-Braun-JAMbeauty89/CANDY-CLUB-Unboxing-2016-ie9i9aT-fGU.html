excited I'm doing an unboxing video
which I do all the time but this one is
for the candy club which if you haven't
heard of it it's a candy subscription
box unboxing and I can't stop smiling
because I'm really excited to see what's
in it and to eat some candy right now
I like the biggest sweet tooth ever but
especially right now my mouth is like
water and just thinking about eating
candy in a minute thanks know I'm always
up front with you guys this is sponsored
by candy club and I'm really excited to
work with them for this video so let's
go ahead and get into it so basically
with the way this works is they have a
survey that you take when you first sign
up on the website even before you
purchase or anything so you can kind of
get a feel for what to expect but the
survey is really quick it's a couple
questions basically asking like okay how
much do you like sour candy sweet candy
spicy candy just so they can tailor your
box to your individual like likes you
know to be what you like when it comes
to candy so I think that's really cool
because it makes it just a little bit
more personalized but this would also
make a really good gift for other people
so you could choose it based on what you
know that person likes as well which i
think is pretty cool I know that they
gave me a code for 50% off your first
order plus free shipping like it's all
in one so I'll link that just below as
well if you're curious or you're wanting
to try it so let's go ahead and open it
I'm so excited
so the first let me just show it to you
so it has some little like informational
things but then oh my gosh so cute
comes with it looks like there's a bunch
of candy like it's littered throughout
and then there's three like actual jars
of candy I'm so excited to see that they
sent okay well first of all let's start
with like the extra candy so it looks
like this is like taffy um it says can
you love the premiere candy of the Month
Club okay so this is sweets cotton candy
saltwater taffy
it's one of the oldest family-owned and
operated companies in the u.s. founded
in 1892
psychotic saltwater taffy since 1910
it's whipped to perfection I got to try
one of these I haven't had salt water
taffy in so long my mom's love saltwater
taffy I got to give her some of this
stuff but I'm assuming that it's cotton
candy flavored so certainly blue it
tastes like cotton candy hmm okay so
that is really good that tastes exactly
like cotton candy and to be honest
that's one of the best saltwater taffies
I've had because sometimes the flavors
are just kind of like that gram but that
was really good
okay so let's get into the actual jars
oh I just noticed that has the nutrition
facts on the back I don't really want to
look to be honest because I don't want
to know but that is really cool and like
my mom for example is gluten free so
there might be some of these things like
if I were to share it with her she
wouldn't be able to eat so I think
that's awesome that they have that and
the boss comes with up to 3 pounds of
candies so they have like when you take
the survey you can either get Club
favorites and that's the one I'm pretty
sure that I got because that was the one
when I took the survey that it pointed
towards but they also Club classic so
it's more like retro nostalgic candies
and then they have clubs sours and more
where it's got a lot more like sour and
fun candy like that so let I'm gonna
start just on one side so the first one
these are looks like the little gummies
but they're little butterflies let's see
what they're called this is the Albanese
mini dummy butterflies
located in the heart of the Midwest this
family-run business has been striving to
create the world's best gummies for over
30 years and they have awards to prove
it
bold fruity flavors okay I love that all
of these are like family-owned companies
and like really old okay hmm
I seriously love gummies and I always
forget how good they are cuz like if I'm
like in a candy aisle I never reach for
gummies but then when I eat one of my
it's so good that was the red one I
think that was like cherry this green
one that's like green apple these are so
good so very excited about those the
next thing in here are looks like jelly
beans
these are the gimbals sour gourmet jelly
beans in the sour located in San
Francisco gimel suspend delivering
smiles and find candy since 1898 Wow
mouth-watering sour gourmet jelly beans
are made with real fruit juice twelve
different flavors they even pump like
mango lime pomegranate I gotta try these
I'm so excited I gotta have my dad try
these because my god loves jelly beans
mmm okay that had to have been tangerine
that was so good let's try the blue blue
is always the best mmm no no try green
I'm just gonna eat them all I gotta stop
okay so those are crazy good and they're
not as sour like if you're not big on
sour these weren't like crazy sour just
had that little bit of a twist to it
which I like because regular jelly beans
I'm not a big fan of but when they're
like really good flavors I love them so
these were really really really good I'm
like craving more right now all right
the last thing in here is they look well
they definitely look sour sour power
wild cherry belts it's an exciting new
flavor lip smacking tart cherry tangy
and everybody since 1985 candy lovers
not been able to get enough of sour
powers wildly popular sour belts
let's try I'm my mouth is you know when
you're anticipating something sour in
your mouth like waters and puckers like
before you even try it that's what I'm
experiencing right now these are long
I'm gonna like rip it in half because I
don't know how sour you are I'm nervous
hmm okay all right they're not okay no
they're hitting this outer part of my
tastebuds I was gonna say they're not
that sour and then it went to the other
side of my mouth oh my there it is um
first of all the texture of these is not
what you would expect it kind of is
because they're like they're like kind
of gummy but they also have that crunch
but they're not as crunchy as you think
either it's I really like it I'm I'm
like obsessed with textures and I will
love a food based on the texture alone
without even dealing with the flavor so
I'm weird like that but I loved eating
this the texture is just cool also
they're just really good okay I have to
admit this is my favorite these are my
favorite they're so good and I like sour
but the other two they weren't like
super sour they were just really really
tasty too but I just really liked these
I'm gonna be eating this will be gone
and like so I think this is so much fun
and that's why I wanted to do this video
because you know I do tons of
subscription box unboxings where lots of
makeup lots of beauty you know but it's
so fun to do something a little bit
different and you know if you've got
kids and you know this would just be a
fun monthly treat for them like for you
and them or if you just love candy or
maybe you're like kind of a candy
gourmand and you like that kind of you
know the fact that these are all from
different places which i think is really
neat that's what makes it special
because they could go to any bulk place
and get tons of candy but I think it's
really cool that they're from very
specific places so as I mentioned I will
have the link below with the promo code
as well so you can get 50% off your
first box I know they have like tiered
things where you can get one month for a
certain amount you can get a little bit
better of a monthly rate if you do six
months etc so all that info is on their
website but I would recommend it I had a
lot of fun doing this I hope you enjoyed
watching and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
