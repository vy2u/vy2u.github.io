gonna share with you guys a ton of dupes
I don't do dupe videos very often
because I like to be very thoughtful
about the duplicates that I'm finding so
if you're interested in seeing the new
dupes that I found please just keep
watching I just take pita chips and
hummus and I marry like self-conscious
that you can see it in my teeth
I don't think you can boy I love pita
chips and hummus anyway okay so let's
start I'm wearing okay now I can't wear
all the dupes cuz some of them like
there's quite a few lip dupes but on
this side of the face I am wearing
either Hayat nor drugstore and on this
side of the face I'm wearing the other
one I'm not going to tell you which one
is which I almost told you I want to see
I'll let you know at the end of the
video see if you guess right I'll show
you this side show you this side I'm so
excited
okay so let's start with some of the
face things the first one that like it's
glaringly obvious to me that these are
dupes one of my favorite Mac blushes the
one I actually wore my wedding day is
called full of joy and it's this
beautiful almost purple toned pink so
certainly a blue tone pink it's just
kind of a satin almost matte finish but
it definitely has a little bit of more
of a satin quality to it
and the dupe for it that I found is by
makeup geek and it's called secret
admirer
and again it's I mean their exact look
at that they are exactly the same shade
so when you swatch them you'll see that
they are really really really really
really close they have a similar finish
on the face as well again at the end of
the video I'll tell you which one is
which but I'm wearing this blush on my
cheeks right now another blush that I'm
not currently wearing is the blush by
benefit called coralista these smell
amazing which is what originally drew me
to the Benefit Box blushes I love them I
own a lot of them and even though I've
decluttered so much I keep most of these
because I love them so much this one is
just a really pretty
shimmery blush color it's sometimes
powdery depending like it kicks up a lot
of dust but the dupe that I found for it
is by Milani and it's their baked blush
in Luminoso this one I had and got rid
of a long time ago but I recently
repurchased it because it's just so
beautiful and it seemed that they kind
of reformulated it I would say that the
Milani one is a little almost a little
bit lighter and in my opinion more
flattering on a fairer skin tone I'm
kind of light to medium
I think Milani is a little bit more
flattering than corrilesa is however
they're both so beautiful they're really
really close and I love both of these
and all of the ones I'm showing you they
have a similar wear time as well let me
look through them and if it's any
different I'll be sure to mention that
but like both of these they stay on all
day so even formula wise they're very
similar the highlight that I'm wearing
today I have a dupe for which the first
one it's Mac's soft and gentle people
have talked about this for years the
gorgeous super shimmery champagne
highlight the dupe I found is by elf and
it's their baked blush they call it but
it's clearly a highlight and it's in the
shade pink tastic these are almost exact
you guys and again I'm wearing one on
one side one on the other I love them
both I could be in a dark room and
either one it's the exact same like I
could grab either one and put it on and
no but I look awesome
I love these highlights I'm in a really
weird mood can you tell like I don't
like it and like I'm too goofy like I'm
trying to scale it back but I feel too
goofy today okay
simmer down Jess alright so the next
thing I'm going to show you I'm also
wearing the expensive one is the laura
mercier secret brightening powder I
recently got this and I don't know like
I feel like it's good but people like
like talked about it like it's like
change in their life but for me it
wasn't life changing so that might be
because I had previously tried the Sonia
Kashuk brightening powder and I really
liked it and I was
this is great so when I bought the laura
mercier one I put it on and I was like
this is just like the Sonia Kashuk white
exactly so again I'm wearing this powder
one of them is under one I am one of
them is under the other they are exactly
the same you guys they're the same you
can save so much money and just buy the
Sonia Kashuk one this is one that I feel
extremely strong about just wearing a
Victoria Secret like little like you
know what do you call this like a
pullover zip up I love these I could
live in these I want to get more colors
if I can find this online I'll link it I
literally could wear in this I literally
could live in this okay so now let's
move on to some lip duplicates so the
first one I'm wearing on my lips I'm
wearing this half is one this happens
the other did you notice did you notice
for real or did you not notice and
you're just saying oh yeah I noticed it
I can't tell the difference now on the
swatches you'll see there's a slight
shade difference but the expensive one
is the Too Faced la creme lipstick these
are so moisturizing and it's in the
shade sugar-daddy and it's just kind of
this neutral kind of peachy color but
it's just kind of a nude color and the
dupe is by Rimmel and it's in their ever
popular shade airy-fairy
and these are so so similar even in
formula I would say the Too Faced one is
a little bit more moisturizing whereas
this one's not but they're both really
comfortable one of them is over here and
one of them is over here if you see one
is a little glossy err than the other
then you've probably figured out which
one is the Too Faced side but I love
both of these and I have been wearing
both of these a lot without realizing oh
I like them both a lot because they're
both like the same so love both of them
so this next one is both a formula and
kind of a shade do so this NARS lip
gloss in Turkish Delight people have
raved about because Kim Kardashian liked
it way back when and it is a really nice
lip gloss I mean I I bought it because
of all the hype but I don't think that
the lip gloss formula of this is any
different than like any lip gloss ever
like it's not it doesn't like stay an
extra long time
doesn't make your lips like plum I mean
there's not really anything to write
home about but this shade is what so
popular it's kind of this milky almost
sheer but it has a little bit of a tint
to it kind of a gloss well Revlon came
out with a new shade and they're super
lustrous line called sky pink and this
one sky pink is a little bit more of a
cool toned pink and so that's why it's
not totally 100% a shade dupe but the
formulas for both of these lip glosses
are I swear identical they wear the same
and even though the shades are just a
little bit different they look exactly
the same on my lips exactly the same so
I would say if you've been wanting this
and maybe it's been on one of those like
I have a list on my phone is like make
up a really long list and make up I
eventually want to buy like a wish list
if this has been on your wish list for a
while I would say it's it really is not
worth the money just buy the Revlon one
it has the same look on your lips the
same feel and you'll save a lot of money
spend it on something else so these last
two dupes are more like formula dupes
because these aren't necessarily one of
them is kind of close but what I've
noticed is that these two lines of these
lip products are very very similar in
their formula so the first one is by YSL
these are their Rouge poor pur Couture
I'm so sorry I'm really bad Rouge pur
Couture um line of like they're lit
they're almost like lip glosses but
they're not and I didn't know what that
meant until I tried it but it's like a
it's like a gloss so you put it on and
it's you know about a little bit of
color this is in the shade 19 um but it
it almost is like a bomb
staying kind of a feel on your lips it
actually at first it feels weird and
just weird I don't because it's really
thin it's a really thin consistency but
then it kind of dries onto it and it
feels kind of moisturizing and it stays
on your lips it's bizarre but I like it
so would I buy another way
like in another shade probably not
because I discovered a drugstore dupe
that I would totally rather spend my
money on this is the l'oreal colour
riche extraordinaire lip color and i
have it in rose melody now these two are
not color dupes for each other but these
the formula of these laurio i never
remember how to open it
i mean it's the same exact they look
similar but it's the same kind of
applicator and it just feels exactly the
same on your lips where it feels like a
really thin consistency but there's
still color to it and they have like
deeper colors but it just feels kind of
comfortable on your lips in a really
weird way you got to try one I'm telling
you if you haven't tried one like this
you got to try at least one so you know
because it's like a different world of
lip products but these are absolute
formula dupes for each other I would say
save your money and just buy the l'oreal
one and the last one is one of my
favorites this is the Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick and this is in the shade
patina
now these colors I'm about to show you
are similar but they're not the dude the
colors aren't dupes for each other but
the formula is so this Stila stay all
day liquid lipstick is my favorite well
I should say one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks because it really does dry
matte so once that dries it will be
matte but it smells nice it feels semi
comfortable it's the most comfortable of
the liquid lipsticks I've tried most of
them are just so drying but it's pretty
comfortable this Milani amore matte lip
cream I love it's in the shade lust Wow
now that I'm looking at it again they
almost are color dupes for each other I
didn't for some reason I thought they
were way different if it's just the
formula but the formula of these I swear
is the exact same they're both very
liquid but they dry matte they stayed
the same throughout like a couple hours
of wear and now I'm seeing that those
are almost dupes for each other I would
say the Milani one is a little more I
don't even know they really are so close
but I love both of these but now that
I've tried a couple of the ceilin ones
this is the only one I've kept because
the other colors just kind of didn't
look right with my skin tone but now
that I know the Villani ones are better
I think I'd rather just spend my money
on more of these instead of spending
money on these they're the same
so hopefully this dupe video was helpful
for you guys I've done I know at least
one maybe two other dupe videos I can
link up there where that little eye is
but I can also link down below for you
if you'd like to see some of my other
dupes from the past otherwise I hope
that you'll subscribe and catch more of
my drugstore and high-end makeup videos
and I will catch you guys in my next one
