dupes video for you I I love doing dupes
I've been doing them for years but I'm
always very selective so today I have a
lot of dupes and then I have one or two
that I wanted to show you that I've
heard our dupes that I really don't
really believe are does that make sense
so I'll save those for the end if you're
not interested I don't know but even
with the ones I'm saying that aren't
truly truly dupes I I still like both
products so we'll talk about that when
we get there but if you enjoyed this
kind of video I hope that you'll
subscribe and give it a thumbs up if
you're interested in my last tube's
video that was a couple months ago maybe
like 6 months I really don't know how I
will link it below otherwise let's go ed
and get into it where to begin
holy moly so I'm gonna try I would say
most of these I'll be trying on my face
so half of my face I used high-end stuff
half of it I use drugstore see if you
can guess which first thing let's start
with something that I was very excited
to find I recently did a facial oils
video like primer oils and how I use
them which ones I love from cheap ones
to expensive ones well one of the ones I
mentioned is the Smashbox primer oil
it's really expensive in my opinion
however you don't have to use a lot each
time you use it and I'll put this on as
a step before I put on like a regular
primer sometimes I'll use just this but
often times I'll put this on my face let
it sink in for a few minutes extra
moisturizing then I put on a primer or
foundation etc so that's how I have been
using it well I found out that NYX came
out with this Hydra touch oil primer and
guys these are the exact same products
like I cannot express to you that I
could be blindfolded and I would have no
idea which one was which other than like
feeling the packaging it is a little bit
different so one thing Smashbox
packaging is nicer they're both glass
bottles but the lid on the NYX one
you'll kind of feel is a little dingy
feeling but it works so that's fine
other thing the Smashbox comes with one
fluid ounce and the next one comes with
0.67 fluid ounces so that's one thing to
keep in mind now if you've never tried
one of these and you're not even sure
that you're gonna like it you might not
want to fool fluid outs either
so that's another thing to keep in mind
I applied the Smashbox one to this side
of my face now you know which sign is my
end and then I applied the NYX one to
this side and so I like to kind of rub
it in a little bit and then press it
into the skin and you can see that it
adds a lot of moisture at first your
skin kind of looks oily literally here's
you are putting an oil on it but after a
few minutes it just kind of sinks in and
it's so moisturize I feel like it's a
beautiful canvas for makeup because you
know all of those dry areas you have are
soothed if you will so I really do feel
like these have the exact same effect
for me these are true dupes if I ever
ran out of like the Smashbox I would
just buy the NYX one and if you've not
bought either I would still just buy the
next one because I really think that
there's no reason unless you just wanted
a full hmm unless you wanted just a full
fluid ounce there's no reason to spend
the money on the Smashbox one the next
one is absolutely the same thing another
product I love using in the mornings is
my milk cooling water stick now this is
kind of a minty feel to it where it's
cooling you can use it all over your
face often times I just focus it around
my eyes but the one thing that drives me
crazy about it is how big it is because
I only use it mostly around my eyes it's
hard to kind of get around there and
like in that little crease there well in
walks the Physicians Formula refreshment
ID puffer it's got cucumber and bamboo
they are different colors but I mean
these are clear completely clear
transparent products I like this one
better and the reason I like it better
is not only because it's a little bit
smaller of a stick so I can really get
around there easily I feel like this has
just a little bit more of a minty
cooling effect than the milk one does
and that's what I'm wanting I'm not
using these to cure fine lines or
anything like that I know they're not
doing that but what I am using it for is
that refreshing feeling in the morning
my eyes are tired I want them to wake up
you know I haven't had my first sip of
coffee it's 6:00 in the morning I've got
to go to work it's a Monday all of those
things that suck right before you know
work this at least makes it just a
little bit better so with that in mind
again I would I would recommend the
physician's formula not only is it much
cheaper but it's easier to use and it
feels better because neither one of
these are gonna be like a sudden healing
product that cures you know all these
under-eye was that's not what they're
about so knowing that I say save your
money this is the one I reach for more
often anyway
this milk one has one point two ounces
this one only has point 45 so this is
more than double and you have to look at
the price and think well if I bought two
of these would it be around the same
price and if you're dying to try this
then maybe it is worth it it's kind of
those things but I still just enjoy the
actual formula of this one better you
know it's always and that's why I'm
trying to check all the ounces because
that's always something to keep in mind
oftentimes drugstores could actually
have very very similar formulas but
they'll just give you less sometimes
because they know that well if we're
gonna make any profit off of this we're
gonna need it you know what I'm saying
and I get it
kind of stinks but I get it and at least
that's a way that you could try these
products without breaking the bank lots
of skin primary products today I've been
on a kick so I have loved for a while
the Becca backlight priming filter this
is great if you like kind of more of a
dewy radiant look to your skin and when
I say radiant I don't mean like glittery
I don't mean shimmery because that's not
at all the effect this gives cuz that
was my original fear I'm like I don't
want to put like something shimmery all
over my face to put foundation on top of
that's not this at all so it's a really
nice packaging frosted glass you can see
the pearlescent formula of this product
but what I do is I just get a little bit
and I will just oh well I'll put it all
over my face just as if it's a primer
that's how I treat it like a primer and
it just gives this really nice glowy
effect now I've been trying the
Physicians Formula spot light
illuminating primer as well I am very
happy to say that this is the I swear to
you the exact same it looks exactly the
same it looks exactly the same even in
swatches it does and you can see as I'm
applying
to the other half of my face the same
after look they stay on now are either
one of these primers gonna hold on to
your foundation and make it last long or
no the point of these primers is not to
make your foundation last longer it's
really just to give that glow from
within underneath your foundation I love
products like this I probably have I'm
embarrassed to say like 12 primers
similar to this but the Physicians
Formula is the closest I found to this
one and they both just they're my
favorite ones of those kinds of primers
because they do just impart that glow
that you look at someone that's wearing
it and you're like wow they're they're
so effortless look at their skin but
odds are they're probably using
something like this under their
foundation and so while it might look
effortless they might just look dewy
it's these products can absolutely give
that effect you gotta see it to believe
it on your own skin does that make sense
I really really like these but totally
the drugstore beats out the Becca Becca
and buy beats out I mean they're the
same so go either way but you can
certainly save a ton of money let's talk
about a concealer now this is not a
shade dupe which that wouldn't make
sense anyway because concealer we all
wear different shades but I have loved
this NARS soft matte complete concealer
now I should that's with the caveat I
did not like it at first it was really
drying I was usually under my eyes uh
but it I started using it on breakouts
and I also use it as an eye primer
that's how I use it today
oh I love it so much it's so especially
it's an eye primer even though it's not
at all how it's marketed it's it cancels
everything out it holds on to shadow I
freaking love this stuff
so the formula of it really is like it
says a soft matte formula so it's creamy
but it really does try down to kind of a
matte finish well then I tried this
Milani secret cover cream concealer now
here's the thing this is the lightest
shade and it's too dark for me so I
can't actually use it in any way that's
useful to me and I'm hoping they expand
their shade range on all ends but this
is a very similar formula at first when
i swatched I'm like oh it's like kind of
greasy like that's you know but once you
actually blend it in
it really does dry down to this kind of
Matt feel that's a very similar feel now
again if you're lighter or if you're
darker you're not going to be able to
find a shade in this but if you're kind
of in the medium range you probably can
and it's worth a try now do I think
these are formula wise exact dupes no I
think this one like I said it's just a
little bit more emollient but I think if
you can find a shade it's worth a try
because I do feel like as I looked at it
and I put shadow on top of it I'm like
it really gives a similar look to this I
do think the NARS wants a little bit
more higher coverage this one's a little
bit more amoliant so there's just slight
differences but they're similar enough
that I'm like I feel like this is worth
mentioning I almost didn't talk about I
was like I'll mention it in case someone
sees this and they see their shade and
they're you know yeah I think it's worth
a try I have a brush dupe this is the
Anasazi a23 highlighter brush I used it
today on my right side and I recently
bought the Milani all-over blending
brush holy cannoli
this stuff it's the exact same thing
it's the same shape and frankly the
Milani one is so much softer it washes
better the anasazi one is more of a
natural bristle so it you know kind of
tends to stick out and the more I wash
it the worse it gets and I haven't even
had it that long and the Milani one the
more I wash it it's it's just a soft
it's really not changing now I do think
this is more synthetic but it gives the
same effect for so much cheaper and I'm
like they're both cute brushes I like it
because I can dip just the side of these
into highlight and just get it right
there and then I'm done if I want to
throw a little bit on the tip of my nose
but they're they're just kind of
effortless to use and I appreciate that
so I really like both but like I said
the Milani when I do think has actually
more pros than the Anastasio one and I'm
just gonna mention this one but I want
to say that I don't own the NARS one so
I know some of you guys be like well you
don't own it you don't even know but I
figure again it's worth mentioning for
the sake of knowledge so this is a brush
from japonesque it was like 20 bucks so
it's still not super cheap but I bought
it at Ulta a while ago and I liked it
today I used it for contour oh no today
I used it for my initial highlight I
used like more of a
more of like a just a glowy highlight
with this and then I used a more
specific super papow highlight with the
other brushes but you can use it for
bronzer blush whatever you want really
it's really soft wash as well this is
looks-wise totally a dupe for the really
expensive NARS
yep CHEO brush and I'll put it on the
screen now like I said I've not felt
that one I will assume that one's gonna
be super soft but this one's really soft
- they're both tapered they have the
exact same shape handle it's kind of
like this like kind of bambooee wooden
kind of a feel and I feel like you know
NARS brushes can be so hiked up but
they're so ridiculously expensive which
is why I don't own it so I wanted to
mention this one if you've just been
eyeing that or maybe it's been in your
wish list and you're just like oh I
really want it go buy this girlfriend
because it's like 20 bucks which is
still expensive but it's really really
good and at least it will kind of like
appease that part of you that likes the
shape of it because for me I just like
the shape of it another primer do oh I
love this primer so much this is the
Laura Mercier foundation primer in
hydrating long ago back when I feel like
all the old youtubers were talking about
Laura Mercier's products and that means
she's still around and I love a ton of
products but I feel like there was a
long stretch like five or six years ago
where a lot of Laura Mercier's products
were very very hyped up well back then I
tried one of they just original primers
and I think I tried a tinted moisturizer
in similar packaging and I was just like
man man you know well then I learned
that they have this hydrating version
and I was like do tell need to try so I
bought it I fell in love day one of
using this and this was you know quite a
few months ago it's a very calm oast gel
like but it's still creamy kind of a
formula and it just my skin just drinks
it up it I feel like my I always have a
good makeup day when I use this and
that's huge because there is nothing
worse than getting ready and looking at
yourself and being like my skin looks
terrible or you know what I'm saying and
I know most of you guys watching her
like yeah
girl I know any fact that you're talking
I had one of those today while I was
getting ready anyway so love this
product it's expensive so I had already
loved this NYX hydro touch primer I feel
like I've talked about a lot of NYX
today well no I really have NYX is very
good at duping things anyway I'd already
loved this and recently I was trying
this I was like gosh this really does
remind me that NYX one so then I just
kind of swatched them as much as you can
swatch a primer next to each other and I
realized you know what these are like
the exact same thing like exact the NYX
one has a blue tint to it I mean they're
translucent once you blend them in so it
doesn't matter they look and feel the
exact same on the skin I feel like again
I have a good makeup day with both of
these there's a reason I love both and I
feel like they're the exact same thing
so don't let the blue throw you off
because they have the same look on the
skin the same feel the same kind of wear
time if you will I love both I I kind of
feel like I love both so much even
though the same thing that I want to
always have both in my collection is
that dumb
that's dumb I know because they really
perform the same but I just I love them
both so much
hey I say both weird I both a lot of
people point that out on my oh I didn't
realize they did I'm like I guess one of
my sisters see both both both both next
up is the cover FX custom cover drops
now there are a bunch of products out
there that are similar to this like I
know hard candy has some pigment drops
while those pigment drops I owned for a
while and they got so weird so quickly
and I've had this for quite a while and
the formulas just like when I first
opened it so what I use this for is to
lighten or darken foundation so I have
two shades and I I do exactly that I use
the lighter one I have to light and
foundations I'll put just a couple drops
it's a little dropper and I'll just mix
them on my hand and then use my sponge
to apply perfect it works perfectly and
what I love about the cover effects is
it doesn't affect the actual foundations
formula
now one that I was trying because I'd
heard it was a Duke was the Knicks total
control foundation drops this is meant
to be a foundation year but you can also
mix it with moisturizer and then you can
do the same with the cover effects to
make more of a tinted moisturizer and
I'd also heard a lot of people were
using it to lighten or darken
foundations well I tried it this way
quite a few times with quite a few
foundations and what I realized is this
really does because it is meant to be
more of its own foundation
it really does affect the foundations
formula and the overall look other than
just the shade so while I do think this
is a cheaper version if you're in need
of something to lighten or darken
foundation but you don't want to spend a
bunch of money cuz you don't think
you're gonna use it a bunch I would say
go with the NYX one
I know NYX has another product that's
darkening and lightening I haven't tried
those like specifically for that but
it's not the same format as far as I
know I think it's more of like a squeezy
to kind of a thing not that that matters
it doesn't matter anyway so out of these
two I really do still love the custom
cover drops especially if you can find a
shade that's just perfect for changing
things for you or if you find one that's
perfect and you'd much rather just mix
it with your moisturizer and go to town
like it's a tinted moisturizer and
that's it it's just so versatile and I
really really like it I get these
sometimes the other shade the darker
shade I got I bought on HauteLook for
half off so just keep your eyes on that
website because I'll link it below
because sometimes cover affects is on
there you can get yourself for 50% off
another product that I don't I heard was
a dupe and I just don't quite think so
and I'll show you what I mean this is
one of my favorite products this is the
Dior lip glow this is one of those
products that's kind of a clearish pink
and it's supposed to kind of use the
temperature and pH of your lips to
change colors to be your perfect pink
that kind of a thing well I freaking
love this stuff more than I ever thought
I would but it definitely has a nice
like at least with my skin tone and my
lips definitely darkens to a darker pink
well I had recently been sent this
Catrice volumizing lip balm from what I
had heard this was a very similar dupe
because it kind of changes color well
this is much much lighter now this does
have a little bit of a tingling effect
which
does feel actually very nice and while I
do really like this product and it's
really inexpensive I would totally
recommend it I you know I literally will
throw this in my purse and use it all
the time it's just not exactly the same
and you can already see that these are
changing with my skin tone I don't know
why I put it in quotes but sometimes I
feel like they don't change and I'm like
hmm this is more of just plumping not
really that color change and this is
more color changing so something to keep
in mind I really like both but I do
think they're just they serve different
purposes so don't let the fact that the
packaging looks very very similar throw
you off they're both good not the same
so that is all I have for you today if
you have any dupe recommendations let's
get a conversation going down below
because I know I freaking love dupes
it's like the most exciting thing in the
world to find especially when the dupe
beats out the high-end or it's at least
the exact same so with that in mind let
us know below your best dupes and I
would love to start planning for a new
video and try some of your
recommendations out as well and if
there's anything that you've been trying
that's or you're wanting to try it it's
really expensive and you're dying to
know a dupe for it let me know that
below as well so I can kind of keep my
eyes peeled and start trying different
things I feel like my hair is crazy
today anyway I hope you'll subscribe if
you enjoyed and I'll see you guys on my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
