dupes for you guys so I've been working
on this for a while and I'm so excited
and I actually had a lot more but I
narrowed it down cuz I was like you know
what I want these to be true true true
dupes not like kind of you know what I
mean so these are my favorite dupes I
own both the high-end version and the
drugstore they're both so
interchangeable and I'm so excited to
share them with you guys cuz you guys
know I don't make a lot of money as a
teacher so I'm always looking for
cheaper versions of expensive stuff I
know you guys are too so let's go ahead
and dig right in
alright so the first thing that I was
really excited to share with you is a
dupe for a matte lipstick this is max
creme Cup and it's one of my favorite
it's just a really nice neutral pink
color and I've loved it for a long time
but it's kind of expensive MAC lipsticks
are well-known they're totally expensive
compared to drugstore lipsticks and then
I fell in love with this maybelline
color whisper and it's in the shade lust
for blush and again it's another nice
neutral pink and I loved both of these
separately for a long time and I only
just recently realized oh my gosh
they're the exact same thing and so here
in these swatches aren't showing you the
bottom one is Mac's cream cup and the
top one is the color whisper and lust
for blush both of them have about the
same sheen to them the same color and
they both look the same on my lips so I
love both of these honestly I end up
reaching for the color whisper more and
that was how it was even when I didn't
even realize these are dupes for each
other I really love love this color
whisper and I love the formula too okay
so the next thing is eye primers and I
have loved the Too Faced shadow
insurance for a while it's not my
ultimate favorite but it is really good
but I end up usually going for like a
cream shadow over one of these types any
day anyway but the Too Faced shadow
insurance is really really good and of
course it's more of a liquid cream than
like a potted cream and you just put it
all over your lid and it holds onto your
shadow all day and it really does work
really well well the wet and wild
version now this is the
wild by Fergie and it's the take on the
day eyeshadow primer these are the exact
same product like part of me is like are
they genuinely like are they made in the
same place I don't think they are no but
I mean they are literally the exact same
they perform the same way throughout the
day I literally did a test with these
where I wore the shadow insurance on one
and this on the other and they both
looked exactly the same at the end of
the day it was amazing this one pretty
darn expensive now this is just a trial
size but the full-size pretty expensive
the wet and wild way way cheaper so
certainly certainly recommend just pick
up the wet wild one okay so the next
thing are I don't really I want to say
concealer but it's not liquid concealers
it's like powder concealers I have loved
this bareMinerals concealer and well
rested and so many people talk about it
but it's pretty pricey I think this pot
is like $18.00 and I love it and it
comes with a decent amount of product
however that's a lot of money for that
now I don't think I'll ever run out of
this which is kind of nice so you know
when you spend 18 dollars it's not going
to expire anytime soon so it'll last you
a while however it's an expensive first
purchase I found the elf eye brighter
and I have in the shade buff these are
totally dupes for each other they both
have the same color I think that the elf
eye brightener and buff is a little bit
lighter but they have different shades
of this so if you wanted one that was a
little deeper you could do that these
are really inexpensive as we know about
elf products and the bare minerals of
course is more expensive this has been a
monthly favorite of mine in the past as
well the elf one is really absolutely
the same it wears the same throughout
the day they both prevent kind of
creasing and I you can wear these alone
just to do a little bit of lighter
coverage but I like to wear them to set
my regular concealer but either way you
can use them and I love them both so
much the one difference is the bare
minerals has an SPF of 20 and this one
does not have an SPF however really I
don't like to wear too much SPF under my
eye because if you're getting flash
photography taken you know if you're
going out this is going to show up a
little more like a white cast under your
eyes and this one won't so that's
something to keep in mind when you're
going out and you're where
one of these that's something to keep in
mind okay so now the rest of my dupes
are eye shadow dupes and I'm really
these are the ones that I'm the most
excited about I think so
one is the dupe for the Mac pigment in
tan this is a cult classic it's one of
their most favorite famous pigments
because it's absolutely gorgeous and
this of course is just like in a little
pop my friend gave me because the
full-size pigments are much bigger but
they're expensive and you know how often
are you going to use a pigment but it's
so absolutely stunning it's this
beautiful bronzy gold color and it's
just absolutely stunning the l'oreal
infallible shadow and amber rush is
exactly the same and here's the swatches
here the bottom one is the Mac pigment
and the top one is the l'oreal one they
are absolutely stunning they both wear
the same they're both a loose pigment so
they're really similar in that respect
as well I kind of like the packaging of
course this is just in a little pot
anyway but I like the packaging of the
L'Oreal infallible ones because they're
easier to deal with most pigments are
really just tricky they get all over the
place they're hard to pad off this is
genius packaging and it keeps it all
compact when you're traveling too which
is really nice okay one of my favorites
shadows in the universe is Urban Decay's
half-baked I have a half-baked is in
both the original Naked palette and the
Naked 2 palette that's how widely loved
it is and I ended up buying it in the
old packaging really cheap like so many
Instagram sale so I bought it
in the single form as well because I
bring it with me every time when I
travel I just adore this gold shadow it
looks so pretty on the lid but then I
found this which is another L'Oreal
infallible shade and it's an eternal
sunshine and again I love the packaging
of this of course the Urban Decay one is
a pressed shadow and this is a loose one
so that's something to keep in mind
however so much cheaper and they're the
exact same color I mean look at these
swatches the bottom one is the Urban
Decay the top one is the L'Oreal
infallible they look the same they wear
the same I just adore both of these and
these I can't
for both cuz you know they're the exact
same the last dupe I'm going to share
with you guys is one of my original
pranksters I love steal a kitten and
it's one of the most beautiful shadows
of course my packaging like fell apart
which stinks but and I've actually had
to repress this because it's so
pigmented it's almost like it's a
pressed shadow but it falls apart really
easy it's very crumbly so I've had to
repress it quite a few times but it is
the most beautiful shimmery champagne
shade ever and it's so light BAM and so
it's hard to find a dupe or at least it
was for me for a while and so I
eventually crumbled it bought this
however I've since found two different
dupes for you so one is l'oreal
infallible I know you're so tired of
them but it's in the shade iced latte
and this one is absolutely stunning and
the other one is the Maybelline Color
tattoo in barely brazen now if you look
at the swatches barely brazen is on top
then the middle one is the iced latte
L'Oreal infallible one and then the
bottom is Cielo kitten you'll see that
honestly ice latte I think is a better
dupe for it it's just it's just as
pigmented as Cielo kitten so I think
these are the closest but I wanted to
mention this one too because if you
don't want it to be as stark this is a
really good option for you and this one
the barely brazen one is buildable so
you could build it two or three times to
be as pigmented as silicon so hopefully
that was helpful for you guys to watch I
know it's a lot of fun finding these
dupes for you guys really helpful
because I know we're all like not made
of money and there are some people that
have so much money and they can buy all
kinds of Hynek products but I can't I
know most of you guys can't so hopefully
this was wonderful if you'd like to see
another one of these let me know and I
can keep my eyes peeled for more dupes
for you guys in the meantime please
subscribe to watch more and I will catch
you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
