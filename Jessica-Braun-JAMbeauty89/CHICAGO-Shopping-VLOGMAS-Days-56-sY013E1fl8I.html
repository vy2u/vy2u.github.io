to think of something to be meaningful
for us our first year of marriage or a
pickle
I don't know German pickle cuz it's a
you know tradition but it's free to get
in here you just can't leave drinks but
it's not as bad as wanting a crown over

their bubai Nanea in a mug and that lady
was on mug
she's like the mascot but I'm sure yeah
but I don't know what the tradition yeah
