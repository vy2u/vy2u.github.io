going to declutter and I also included
any like specifically under-eye setting
powders with it just as I figure it kind
of makes sense in here more than
anything else so the way I've been doing
these this time around is I've just been
asking myself okay if I look at my
entire collection what would I buy again
so like I'm pretending my own stash to
pretend like okay what do I love enough
to keep that much that I would buy it
again
right off the bat some of the ones I
know I love and would keep I've been
using this naked skin weightless
concealer a lot do I think it's like the
most amazing concealer of all time no
but do I really like it yes I've
traveled with it which usually has to
sign that I really like it enough to
have only that to use for like a week
long or however long so this one I
really like I like that the doe foot is
like that kind of flat kind of flattened
out just but I don't know why I like it
but I really do and it blends well all
of these concealers crease I don't care
what anyone tells you at least on me all
of the new but if I kind of give it a
minute kind of Pat it into the crease
one more time and then use a setting
powder that really that completely
transforms any of them so something to
keep in mind but definitely a key for me
another definite keep is this Kat Von D
one I just recently got it and I really
do like it it's got really high coverage
I have it in l7 warm they have a million
shades I mean the reality the beauty of
concealer is you know even if it's not
perfect for you it'll you can still make
it work but I really like this is very
very brightening very high coverage but
it's not as high coverage just say like
the tarte maracuja creaseless concealer
that kind of a concealer it's not quite
as thick and tacky and I really do like
it
so definitely keeping that both of these
are pretty new to my collection
I'm still trying out the YSL Touche clot
one and again it's new to my collection
I just don't I like it but I don't quite
see why everyone's like why it's such a
cult classic you know what I mean it is
nice it blends very quickly into the
skin it is not a coverage type of
concealer so if that's what you're
looking for this is not for you because
that's not the edge
the ideas that it's just radiant it
brightens the area I like it but I need
to try it more to figure out why it's
such a cult classic but I do like it
another one that I love it reminds me
the YSL Touche claw is this one from
number 7 it's their radiant glow
concealer and this one is amazing it's
just as good as Y itself but I probably
even better because I know why I like
this it does the same thing I mentioned
the other one does but it's so much
cheaper so I don't love that the
packaging gets super dirty super quickly
but I love this concealer alright so now
let's just kind of go through these one
by one to decide what I want to keep
those are the four that really stood out
to me and ones I absolutely adore so
starting here the superstay better skin
I've had this for quite a while does it
have an expiration date on it usually it
has like that little symbol that tells
you how long not singing anywhere but I
have had this a while and it's I like it
it's not a bad concealer but I think
it's kind of you know it does some
things you can never tell how much is
left in it or not but um no I like it
like I like this one better than this
Maybelline one now this fit me is in the
wrong shade I will tell you that I
literally used it yesterday and I was
like okay that is way wrong what was I
thinking I have no idea so I'm going to
definitely pass this Maybelline one on
the better skin I think I want to just
use up and then get rid of because it is
I like to shade again it kind of has
that like gray tone that I really like
but it's brightening it stays in place I
like it so continuing on I love I've
gone through a lot of a cosmetics
bye-bye under-eye but I and I liked it
but it's more coverage than what I need
right now where I'm at with my skin but
I really like the vibrant under-eye
illumination this one is not quite I
don't want to say the other ones matte
because not I mean it's a concealer
which is kind of a different world but
this one I really liked and I'm not it
just kind of added as Chloe finish it
was really nice I did still have to set
it because I mean please it's super
tacky super high coverage but I think it
looked a little bit nicer than the
regular one did on the
so I'm definitely going to keep it I
know my sister is obsessed with just the
regular Valentine right so I'm but I
really like the eliminating ones this is
so hard today love like all of these
that's my problem so this is the l'oreal
visible at the blur and this one again i
have it in fair and i was so surprised
how much i like this again it kind of
has this almost grey tone to it and i
love that
it just ends up looking really natural
on me of course that wouldn't look
natural on everyone but again you just
to set this one but i just really like
it i love it comes with a pretty good
amount of concealer like this comes with
point two fluid ounces this comes 2.6 so
it comes with a lot of concealer you
really can get all of the youth out of
it because it isn't a squeezy tube and I
was just very surprised by how much I
liked it this one I go so back and forth
with this is the maybelline instant age
rewind from the drugstore and I like it
but I feel like it's just kind of I
don't know now that I tried so many more
drugstore concealers this one doesn't
Wow me as much this was a little bit too
yellow for me as well so I'm going to
pass it on I like the like brightening
wand but that one's almost too pink as
well so I kind of need to find a common
ground this one's the neutralizer shade
so it is meant to neutralize dark
circles things like that but it's just
too yellow for me it doesn't quite work
the bornus waste concealers I like I
don't think I need to keep both I have
fair and light I'm going to keep light
and get rid of stare but just using
getting ideas to watch wise in case you
you're fair like I am and you're curious
does that one is fair and then light I
mean they're so fun I think white has a
little bit more of a warmer tone to it
you can see them there I like them both
but I certainly don't need them both so
I'm going to keep light and pass on fair
one of my sisters will be very excited
so this is the right
a shade of the Dream Lumi and I do like
this but it's very my dogs barking in
the other room it's just very pink it's
just too pink and even when I blend it
out I used to love this I think again
now that I've tried so many more
products it's just a little bit too
almost salmony for me and I again I
don't need that much but if you do you'd
really like this but I'm going to pass
that one on as well those kind of views
that I've had for a while that it might
be just time to get rid of this tarte
maracuja creaseless concealer I love but
this is years old and that says twelve
months so which is time will I
repurchase eventually maybe but I have
this NYX one that is just as good and I
just recently got the NYX gotcha Covered
one in light the same kind of a you know
kind of squeezy two very thick formula
kind of reminds me to buy my under eye
illumination very high coverage it's
waterproof as well I did like a
waterproof test video and I wore a full
face of makeup and tried out a bunch of
things like this that were claimed to be
waterproof to see like if you just stand
in the shower with water running over
you for minutes will it stay on and
everything did it I was so surprised
with all drugstore so I really really
like this very impressed by it so this
Mac Pro Longwear concealer I have had
since forever does it say doesn't have
the little thing with the years but I
have had this for so long it's starting
to look really gross I can't believe
I've only use half of it or maybe make
like two thirds I've had this for so
long so it's just time to say goodbye I
feel like I've had this since I started
my channel which is terrifying to me so
I need to stop using it and pass it on
but I'll probably buy a new one
eventually I might get it a shade
lighter on them this by the way I have
in NC 15 actually that was pretty good
maybe I would get the same so this dream
Lumi I like a little bit better this
one's in ivory so it's not quite a
brightening radiant type shade it's more
of a natural for me kind of a shade and
I do really like these so I'm going to
keep that this I just don't ever use
this is this closing cover pencil
concealers by Nisha is a really
creamy concealer stick but I just don't
ever use it it's a little bit deep for
me if you want to conceal comfort
pimples and stuff but this I'm glad to
get rid of this is a Sonia Kashuk quad
I've talked about a couple things it's
really creamy some of them are well no
they all are but they it doesn't work
like you try and like blend it in and it
doesn't I love that it's got different
undertones and then it has this powder
to kind of set it but I just never ever
use it I don't like the way it works
just kind of glides around and never
just stays put so that I'm getting rid
of it so for a banana powder look this
is just too yellow for me the perfect
example here we kind of get it out of
here is this this is a NYX banana powder
and it's much lighter than that that is
totally more for me considering my skin
tone so I'm going to keep the next one
which is an amazing and get rid of the
Oprah one and pass it on to someone that
might really really like it but I'm
going to get the next one this is the
lab these are all powders I'll talk
about in a sec but this is the last like
actual concealer by Bobbi Brown it's
their corrector in light bisque and this
is one of those things that I just like
to have I don't use that very often but
it's like I really was just really tired
that day and I needed I had dark circles
whatever this is ideal so it's not an
everyday kind of a concealer but it's
the only thing I have like this for if I
needed it and it's a great it's such a
better it's such a better formula than
the Sonia Kashuk one is it actually
stays in place so I really like that so
now I've got these six powders I'm
already keeping my NYX one I love this
is a press one but really does a great
job brightening and setting the
under-eye but these I just got in the
set and I'm still kind of trying out to
determine what I like best the only one
I might consider getting rid of is
they're all translucent but this is
violet vanilla and vanilla rose this
pink one I think doesn't make sense for
me so that might be the only one I would
like to think about getting rid of at
this point this early in the game
because I don't think pink is what I
quite me
under there but for now since I did just
recently get these muscle training out
I'm going to keep them try them out I
probably won't necessarily keep all
three we'll see but I really really like
them I love all three of these as well
this bareMinerals concealer and well
rested is fantastic it is so brightening
very yellow but I mean if you want to
look like flawless under your eye this
is the way to go it is so perfecting and
beautiful now if you get too
heavy-handed with it can look kind of
crazy but it is what it is I still
really really like it so definitely
keeping this I would repurchase that
again and again since everyday minerals
one I just watched they're very very
similar to the bare minerals but a
little bit lighter not quite as like
yellow toned so I might keep that as
well
and then this is the Laura Mercier one
and it's their secret brightening powder
in number one and it's very similar I
have like her whole loose powder as well
but this one's just a white translucent
powder it's just very brightening I like
it so I'm definitely going to keep so
this is everything I'm keeping this is
what I'm getting rid of I think I've got
too much and always but of course this
is my job and some of these but once I
use them up I'm not going to repurchase
but I don't think I'll repurchase the
better skin or the Dream Lumi or be born
this way you know things like that these
I might not have all of them forever but
the rest I use all the time other than
Bobby Brown so I love them I use them I
know that I could close my eyes reach in
a drawer and grab any one of them and
really like the look that it gave me so
that feels great these are either just
too old or they're not the right shade
or I just don't like the formula so this
is great to get rid of these some of
them will just go straight in the trash
these are pretty old but other ones that
are pretty new I might pass on to a
sister that doesn't mind but yeah I
think I did okay it's not my Vespa
clutter if you're interested in watching
more declutter they've done some really
ruthless ones my blush when I get a 50%
of my own collection my bronzer when I
did the same get rid of a lot of
highlighters foundations etcetera so
definitely check those out as well as
all of my other years of declutter
videos
