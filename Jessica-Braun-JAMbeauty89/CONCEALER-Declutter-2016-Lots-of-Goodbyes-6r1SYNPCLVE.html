concealer powders I am going to organize
these and then we'll go through them one
by one
how can I forget that I also have the
rest of the collection of the Too Faced
Born This Way concealer so these I'm
going to also set out here because I do
need to do something with these and make
a decision with what I'm gonna do with
them so these are all my concealers now
let's just start over here this is this
Sonia Kashuk hidden agenda
concealer palette and I just have
decided I don't love concealers in pop
form I was not as impressed with this as
I thought I would be considering a lot
of people on YouTube at least a couple
years ago love to this stuff but it was
just okay and for me I just don't it's a
little bit too dry for my under eye and
I know a lot of people actually want
that and need that so I'm gonna pass
this on this is the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye I really like it but I find
myself when I've had like the full size
of my collection which I've sent to
clutter just on my own but I just
recently got the smaller one I actually
really do like it but I never need that
much coverage and when I do I have other
things I can use so I'm just gonna pass
this on before I even open the little
seal this is the visible lift blur
concealer and I am shocked at how big
this concealer is like it's just a big
you'd think it would almost be like a
foundation in a way but it's actually a
really nice concealer I was impressed
with the foundation as well if you've
seen my foundation declutter I was very
impressed with the foundation like I
said so the concealers pretty good I
think it blends better with your hand
than anything I've tried it like with a
brush and I don't think it blends as
well and I don't use Beauty blenders
every single day but it works ok with
that as well so I am going to keep this
this is this boots number 7 radiant glow
concealer and it's one of those pen
types and it's just kind of a glowy
colored concealer I was very impressed
with this I wish that the actual
packaging didn't get so dirty because it
always grosses me out but I really do
like this
so I'm gonna keep it so this is the YSL
Touche clop neutralizer it's just kind
of a peachy toned
one but it's a neutralizer not
necessarily a concealer so it just kind
of adds the color to your skin
I just find that with my skin tone it
doesn't it's just not working I don't
really need this so I think I am gonna
pass this on even though it kills me
because it's YSL and I don't want to but
I just don't use it gotta be honest with
myself alright so these when we might as
well talk about all of them these are
the Too Faced Born This Way concealers
now I have three shades that I think
work okay with my skin tone and then all
of the rest of these don't so like
there's medium deep tan dark deep medium
tan tan let me see this is light medium
though because I'm thinking maybe the
fair one might be too light and maybe I
could switch it with this now that I do
have a little bit more that is I think
too dark I think I'm gonna pass these on
and let the ladies at work go through
these it's like oh my gosh I can't
believe but what am I gonna do with all
of them I think I am gonna keep these
three though this is fair very fair and
let me go ahead and open this one and
light they're all so similar though let
me kind of swatch them and decide so
that's very fair fair light and that was
the light medium so light medium is
definitely way wrong
I think light and fair are good I think
very fair is too light and obviously the
light/medium so I'm gonna get rid of
very fair and just keep these two this
is the maybelline instant age rewind
eraser and this is in the shade oh this
is the neutralizer one and I really this
is the first time I bought this one I
used to buy the pink like brightener one
which I like but I think I like this one
better because it has like that yellow
tone to it so I love this again I wish
the packaging didn't get so gross but I
do love that actual concealer
alright so sorry I had to replace my
battery there so this is the Bourjois
healthy mix concealer and it is so bad
like I really mean that and I again I
wanted to love this I was so
disappointed but I hadn't really heard
great things about the concealer I'd
heard good things about the foundation
and so if you saw my foundation
declutter
get rid of that one as well but it just
never blended into the skin like at all
it looked crazy I had to take it off
I've tried it like three or four times
every time same thing so I think it's
just not good with my skin this is the
maybelline superstay better skin
concealer this one's oh well goodbye
wrong pile this one I like actually it's
kind of the one I keep grabbing for
because it's so quick to apply and I
mean really and it blends so easily and
it really does brighten that area so for
me I'm like it's kind of the perfect
concealer and I feel like it's almost
gone too so whether I'll repurchase it
or not will depend probably more on how
many concealers I still have I need to
use things up this is the tarte maracuja
creaseless concealer this one doesn't
look like it but it's actually I'm
pretty sure almost gone yeah there's
only like that much left so this is one
I really do like but it does leave your
under-eye really dewy but it has amazing
coverage so this is one that I
definitely don't use for everyday I did
for a while and then I realized you know
what like I just don't need that thick
of a product but it really is an amazing
concealer if you have a lot to cover
this is the Mac Pro Longwear concealer
you can see that it's getting pretty low
but I'm gonna use it until it's dead and
then I probably will buy it again
because it's one that I travel with
constantly it is amazing I just wish the
pump were more controlled where you can
control how much comes out that's all I
wish they would redo that but other than
that I hate it when it looks like this I
like to like hit it so it gets concealer
everywhere that looks better doesn't it
yeah I love this stuff so much it was
worth the $20 or so that it cost in it
lasts forever it is last to be so long
all right this is the bare minerals well
rested concealer I never use this
because I got the clear kind and I don't
know what other kinds there are I bought
this when we were on our cruise but it's
it doesn't really I mean it kind of
brightens the area but it doesn't really
I don't know like cover I don't really
know I guess it's just meant to brighten
but I don't love it I've only used it a
couple
I think I'm gonna pass it on this I just
bought this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 20 it's a little
bit deeper than any of my other
concealers but what I like about it is
it actually works pretty well to cover
face blemishes color wise but it also
still looks good under my eyes once I
blend it you'll see kind of lightens up
and it really is a nice formula for a
long time I didn't get what all the hype
was with this but the more I've used
this I've realized you know what
actually does blend really well and
really quickly under your eye
it does settle into fine lines however
but honestly like all of these do at
least for me but it works really well if
you said it loved all of these to be
honest this is the bare minerals well
rested powder concealer and it is
incredible it I've had this for ever
again it lasts for a very long time it's
a very light powder but it really
brightens the under eye you don't even
need a concealer with this it works well
on its own but I love when I want to
look really flawless I'll use this and
I'll use this and it is absolutely
remarkable it is probably like if I
could own only one thing out of all this
it'd probably be this because it's so
incredible this is the everyday minerals
one it's pretty darn amazing as well
it's the same exact type thing where
it's a mineral concealer it's really
brightening do I really need beause
probably not and that's the only thing
I'm thinking I'm like you know I really
don't need to have both of these they do
the exact same thing I think I might
just finally pass this one on even
though I love both but I like this one
just a little bit more I'm never gonna
run out of like either one of these
these are gonna last let me look at it
yeah this is probably halfway full and
I've had it forever this is actually
pretty full and I haven't used maybe I
should just keep both of those though I
think I'm gonna keep both because why
get rid of and they are a little bit
different of tones this the last thing
is this Laura Mercier secret brightening
powder and this again a similar idea but
this I even like to use
it's even more finely milled
I think it's not as brightening but it's
still nice this looks really nice if
you're just trying to highlight your
face as well so I think I'm just gonna
keep all of them I really do love them
all there's a reason they've kind of
stayed in my collection for quite some
time so this on the top is everything
I'm keeping this down here is everything
I'm getting rid of I think I did a
pretty darn good job I mean it's
obviously still more concealer than I
could ever use in a before they'd go bad
but a lot of them are for the most of
the way gone like all three of these are
pretty much gone right here but I love
them all and I use them all and I feel
like for pretty much all of these I feel
that I can remember the last time I use
them because it wasn't that long ago
whereas with a lot of these I always
look at them and just look right past
them because I never want to use them so
