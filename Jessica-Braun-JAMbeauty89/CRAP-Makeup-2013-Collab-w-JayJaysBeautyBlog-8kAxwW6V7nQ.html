bringing you a collaboration video this
marks my very first collab with anyone
else here on YouTube and this is a
collab with my friend Jordan she goes by
JJ Weezy and I will of course link her
channel down below I have absolutely
fallen in love with her and she started
a channel after I did but her channel
has grown way faster than minded I don't
know what she doin is she doing
something right her personality is just
she's just so sweet and generous she's
got a little kid oh and he is cute as
can be
and if you're if you've got children I
just think she's so relatable whether
you have children or not of course I
don't but she just she talked about how
to save money which I love because
that's something I also do and I just
think we have a lot in common which I
really like and I just think she's so
fun to watch honestly so her channels
link below she also did a products I
regret buying video which if it's up
before my or after mine I'll link it
below either way eventually there will
be a link below so look out for that um
anyway so this is gonna be a fun video
because there are a lot of products that
I have regretted buying over the years
and some of these you might recognize
from past like favorites and fails video
as fails that I've mentioned but I've
kind of gathered everything together
this is gonna be fun so oh okay one of
the first things I want to mention is
the Revlon just bitten kissable balm
stain I love these
but this shade which is in the shade
darling looks so bad on my skin tone oh
my gosh it looks really pretty there it
doesn't look like anything but in real
life it's like kind of a purplish like
Barbie pink and it looks so bad it makes
my teeth look yellow it just every time
I wear it
someone will be like what's on your lips
I'm like okay Nix Nix Nix hate it so for
me the shade didn't work but I do love
the balm stain so it's kind of a hit or
miss you know and that would probably
look good on darker skin people for sure
okay another thing I regret buying which
is a big one big letdown is the Laura
Mercier tinted moisture
I got this on a good deal but it's just
it looks orange on my skin it's not the
right shade but beyond that it makes my
skin look so greasy and I don't really
have oily skin but it makes it look so
greasy it's just the exact opposite of
what I want Anna tinted moisturizer in
the packaging like fell apart like the
glue came off so like it's just for
something that's so expensive I couldn't
believe how the packaging was just like
kind of crappy and it just looked
terrible on me just terrible so that was
a big fail another thing I regret buying
is this Victoria's Secret it's a line or
duo and there's like a glittery side and
like a darker just like regular pencil
side and I don't even know if they sell
this shade the shade was smoking mirrors
but the glittery side is just chunky
glitter and then the other side it's
smooth but it ends up like running not
running I'm like smearing on my eyes
throughout the day so this was just a
fail and some of the Victoria Secret
makeup is really good but some of it is
really bad so this one was one of the
bad ones I hated it this is a more
recent one I brought the voluminous
million lashes and waterproof and it's
like in the gold tube
I honestly bought it because of the
packaging and because I needed a
waterproof mascara when we were going to
Miami in Key West this it was terrible I
don't even know how to describe it you
know what I'm almost curious to know I
don't even want to try it again I
couldn't get this stuff off no matter
what I tried it was the weirdest I've
never experienced that with any other
waterproof mascara or anything um not
only that but the packaging link won't
shut properly like it's like not lined
up and I can't silly but it bothers me
anyway and it was just smeared like you
put it on instantly be like all the way
down here it's like what I literally
never experienced the problems that I
experienced with this with any other
mascara in my life it's very weird so I
do not recommend this mascara just
across the board just don't another
thing and I think some people might
fight me on this one the origins vytas
Inge I didn't see I know that there was
a big fuss about it for a while and so I
got it and I don't like it I mean I
don't see what the big deal
as I didn't think my skin looked better
because of it I certainly couldn't wear
it alone
you know and it's not like it says that
it's got great coverage or anything like
that don't really have any coverage but
it was I don't know I just don't see
what all the buses I don't think this is
worth however much it was I don't even
remember now but it was pricey I
remember that and I just don't think it
really helped my skin that much the SPF
was nice but there's only SPF of 15 so
not worth it ladies I'm telling you
another one this one's okay I don't know
why I don't like it this is the Revlon
Photoready cream blush and coral reef
it's like the one that's like almost
like orange and I just it didn't stay
throughout the day now a lot of cream
blushes don't stay and you can kind of
pile a powder blush on top of it but if
I'm using a cream blush it's usually
because I don't want to use more than
one product I just want to use a cream
blush and it just look kind of nice and
flush and moisturize but this one didn't
really do anything for me and I just
hated it it was nice because it came
with a lot of product in it but it was
like $13 when I bought it
first of all Revlon what are you
thinking $13 your drugstore brand that's
like that is a ridiculous price anyway
but I just didn't learn it's not worth
it another thing that I really really
didn't like was the elf conditioning lip
balm mostly because it smells like
burning plastic no it smells like
melting plastic and I don't know if it's
just this shade or what it was in the
shade mellow melon and it's kind of like
this fun funky color and it was pretty
pigmented which threw me off because I
didn't really want anything that
pigmented but it sheers out a little bit
but it's still got a decent amount of
color which you know that's fine but it
was the smell it literally made me feel
so nauseous throughout the day and every
time I tried it right now I mean most of
these products I literally have put in a
separate little basket that I just in
it's like in a drawer I don't even look
at because these are products I know I
just hate I can't even make them work
for me
okay another one now this is a lesson
learned this is when I was first kind of
getting into makeup and I wanted
try some mac eye shadows right and have
a lot of money I never have a lot of
money but I especially didn't then and
um I went on eBay and I saw Wow Mac
eyeshadows of cheap on eBay and I knew
that obviously not all of them could
have been real Mac but I found one like
you know I kind of read some of the
reviews and I'm like gosh maybe this is
legit so I ordered just one and it was
only like $7 wasn't that big video and
the packaging came in and it really
looks exactly right I mean it literally
I've compared it to my other Mac it
looks exactly the same and it was in the
shade all that glitters
I already swatched I now have all that
glitters in a palette that my friend
amber got me this is the one that was in
the ebay one and this is all that
glitters from Mac look that is a huge
difference so obviously it wasn't real
so it's kind of wasted money I could
have spent that that and three dollars
more and gotten a pan of it you know
what I mean so that was kind of a bummer
I should have known and yes - lesson
learned oh I should have known but but I
tried it nonetheless and now I know for
sure so totally different shades totally
different finish I mean it's like out of
this world and totally different anyway
um another thing that I regret buying
and this was actually I didn't buy this
one this one was sent to me from a
subscriber and it was so sweet she sent
me a bunch of different ones and this is
one I'd wanted the wet-and-wild 8 pan a
palette that was their matte collection
and this is called drinking a glass of
shine they might have renamed it like I
heart matte or something like that but
once I got it I was so excited about it
but then I realized none of these are
colors I will ever wear this is much too
red for me I don't really wear these I
might wear that but the rest of these
I'd never wear it's just not in my taste
so that was a bummer because I was so
excited about an entire palette of matte
shadows and then I got it and I was like
oh my gosh I'm never gonna wear any of
these colors so there's that that was
kind of a letdown - okay
another one that I I don't regret buying
because it was only a dollar it was a
Milani product I found at the Dollar
Tree you can always find Milani products
there I loved it and it was in the shade
green it's in the shade eternal and it's
there I didn't even tell you it's in the
shade eternal and is there green like
infinity liquid liner and it says UPS it
first of all look at how the brush was I
don't know if that's gonna it's like all
like raggedy and then it it says it
wears for 24 hours except for it
absolutely does not it's a really pretty
color but it was like gone after an hour
I was like what he was just gone and
probably no wonder was at the Dollar
Tree maybe that was why but I was really
let down because Milani
is such a pretty color and they usually
have such great products so that was a
huge letdown maybe it was just old
that's the other body anyway okay this
was a doozy this is the all may wake up
eyeliner and highlighter and I was
really excited about this because I've
been wanting a navy blue highlight or
eyeliner and then it came with like a
little white highlighter this thing is
the worst product ever the I almost
laugh about this blue this look I wish
you could have seen like I'm not even
gonna be able to describe this the
finish on this blue is the weirdest
finish it's not like a navy blue it's
not sapphire it's like a weird dusty
like cornflower blue if you know what I
mean like it was just so weird I was
like that is not at all what I pictured
when you see the blue like on the cap so
that was a letdown and then the white is
just bizarre the the you could probably
see it right next to it the feel of it
is I don't really know how to wear it it
has like glitter in it I'm like I'm not
gonna use it right there with a bunch of
glitter in it and I'm just
it just seemed odd the whole product was
weird I'm like how am I supposed to use
this together so that one and I think I
ended up getting like a good deal on it
but still I was like man and now I'm
stuck with this little sucker so that
was another letdown okay the last thing
that I'm gonna mention is the I actually
recently got these again from the dollar
store it seems to be a trend maybe I
should stop buying makeup at the dollar
store these are the LA color shimmering
loose eyeshadow with
I got it in two different shades I got
it honeysuckle and sunshine
absolutely titled and they're beautiful
right well the packaging is what killed
me on these you unscrew the top and then
you take this off and it's a little
brush that's like already dipped so the
brush gets all im9 I was out of the
paint um what am I saying look like
talking about anyway it's just like
messed up like the brush gets messed up
you like dip it into this weird thing
and then it just goes everywhere you
can't get it to stay it's not as
shimmery as I thought it would be if you
can even see that it's like right there
it's not even shimmering and it's called
the shimmering loose eyeshadow and it
just got all over my face bottom line
these are only a dollar still wasted
dollars even if all of these things only
cost a dollar I would have wasted like
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen like
thirteen bucks except for some of these
were like $40 ridiculous anyway so those
are all the products i truly regret
buying and wasted money however i'm
looking at these things things and for
some of them that like for example to
balm stain that it was just the color i
didn't like i'm thinking of like friends
or sisters that i might like those
colors so same with like this matte
palette so anyway those are all of the
products i hope that was helpful
definitely check out Jordans channel
below to check her video i can't wait to
watch it
and I will catch you guys very very soon
