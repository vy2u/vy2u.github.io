a video inspired by my friend here on
YouTube Samantha March I will link her
channel and her video version of this
she did it a while ago and it was all
about cult favorites that she's never
tried now I don't know if she got the
idea from someone else but since I
watched hers and that's what inspired me
I figured she'd be the one I'd mention
now you can't make fun of my hair
because it's been after a long work day
and it just I'm like flip-flopping it
you ever like feeling happy with your
hair so you're like let me just like
flip it this way and then it looks good
for like two seconds Senora Chloe let me
flip it back so I'm gonna try not to
mess with my hair there are absolutely
no promises
anyway so I am so excited to do this
video because I thought you know there
are a lot of products I haven't tried
but what was kind of crazy to me is that
as I did kind of scroll through like the
best sellers at Sephora and Ulta I
thought holy ok know I've got like my
simplehuman a lot of you guys asked
about this mirror it's this simple human
mirror I can link it below it's awesome
but I have it here and when it's facing
you it's like an automatic light which
is great when you're getting ready but
not now I don't need anymore like okay
wow boy this this video has been
derailed so quickly okay focus so I have
tried so much makeup and that's not like
ragging about it I mean that's my job
here but it was kind of amazing going
through and thinking wow like I really
have tried a lot but there certainly are
some things that like I feel like
everyone's try and I have it and so I
wanted to share it with you this video
is just for fun I'm not really sure what
you're supposed to get out of it at all
I mean so you don't have to watch it
like I feel like this is just like I'm
just here to chat and I've got my little
coffee and my reindeer mug and then just
get a chat about a bunch of makeup I
guess for me it's beneficial to me
because I want to hear what your guys's
thoughts are like do you feel like if
you've tried these products are they
worth the money are they where all of
these products are ones that are like
Sephora kind of high-end ones if you
want me to do a drugstore version of
like drugstore products I haven't tried
let me know I don't know if that would
be fun to watch weird to watch I don't
know I'm not sure that this video is
gonna be very good let's just go ahead
and into it oh but I hope you'll
subscribe before I get too far into it
we're like five minutes into the video
alright so the first one I've been
compiling a list as I've come up with
them one that I haven't tried that I
feel like has like I don't know that
this is necessarily a cult favorite this
is a rough place to start but this venti
foundation that's new I know that the
big thing with it is it's awesome
because of the color range finally a
line where they're like actually
embracing you know everyone as it all
should be and so that's really me and I
totally get the height behind that but I
do know and the reason I haven't you
know kind of pulled the trigger on
buying that is because so many people
with my kind of skin type dry kind of
normal but kind of more on the dry side
don't really like it and so I feel like
okay well I could put on like a primer
oil underneath and a really moisturizing
primer and all this stuff I'm like
sometimes I don't want to go through all
that work and I already have foundations
that are really high coverage that I
have to do that with that if I'm gonna
go through all that work I'd rather have
that kind of coverage so I don't know if
I eventually will buy it or not I did
recently pick up the primer from her
line and her lip the universal lip balm
gloss balm is awesome so I am trying out
some things from the line I think I just
bought the highlighter too but the
foundation I'm not sure what do you guys
think is it good for dry skin I've kind
of just heard like mmm kind of things so
I am I'm kind of curious to see what you
guys think that foundation by the way is
$34 did I say that alright so the next
thing I've never tried are the Anasazi
aglow kits I almost bought them these
are $40 by the way I almost bought them
on I want to say Black Friday
I think Ulta had them for like 40% off
or I mean it was a really good deal and
I almost pulled the trigger on that one
but I didn't because I thought you know
what I have so many highlighters and
Highland's that I already love and I
like trying out highlighters but these
Glo kits I don't know that I need them
have necessarily gotten bad reviews a
lot of people love them but for me when
I look at like any of them I think okay
I definitely use that color I might use
that color and then there's always two
that I definitely wouldn't use like they
wouldn't work as a highlighter for me
and I know some of them are meant to be
bronzers but I don't really love glowy
bronzers so I'm like so for me I think
it's just never really made sense to buy
and I almost feel I could be away some
money
and on top of that the only other reason
I might buy that would be for like
review purposes but I feel like
YouTube's already so oversaturated with
posted saturated oversaturated with
reviews of those glow kits that I'm like
I don't think I really need to add to
that noise especially if I don't really
have the desire to you know what I'm
saying but what are your guys thoughts
on those glow kits or if there's one one
you'd recommend what would be the one
you would say that people should get
alright
why does face ID not recognize my
freaking face it don't recognize me it's
like sunglasses on but that all like
look right at it and it's like no I'm
like another product I've never tried is
the Marc Jacobs
Highliner eyeliners is out there called
these are what price are they $25 and
here's the thing I do like a lot of Marc
Jacobs products like I like their
lipsticks which is what I'm wearing
today I'll talk about in a minute
I love their lipsticks I really like
their coconut primer I've even tried
like their coconut like gel like
highlighter I like that too so there's a
lot I do like from their beauty line in
their eyeshadows but I've never really I
don't know I'm gonna say this and then
I'm gonna completely go against what I'm
about to saying I want to say I don't
like spending a lot of money on on
eyeliners I'm losing it you guys I don't
like spending a lot of money on
eyeliners because they're just eyeliner
I feel like if it's a pencil liner
I freaking fly through it because I wear
it every day also the drugstore has
unbelievable eyeliners let me show you
alright I just picked up two they're
both like almost gone you can tell I
love them one of my favorites in the
drugstore is the Milani stay-put
waterproof eyeliner it's literally I
need a sharpener I'm getting really
closely at first of all the packaging
looks like the Urban Decay packaging
amazing creamy incredibly black eyeliner
then I also love the Rimmel waterproof
scandalised liner again they I feel like
the same formula I think I like the
Milani one better probably only because
of the packaging which I don't care how
it sounds cuz if they're around the same
price why not pick the one that you like
the packaging better if they're
performing the same anyway know who I'm
explaining that to I'm sure any of you
guys understood that these are amazing
so why spend you know twenty-five
dollars on an eyeliner it's gonna be
gone like that now will I ever try them
maybe just because I want to and let you
know or like maybe
I ever did like a Marc Jacobs like all
about the brand kind of video I might
have tried enough to be able to do that
I don't know let me know if you'd be
interested that might be farther in the
future because I think I'd want to try
some more you know maybe a foundation
from them things like that but I say
that but take it with a grain of salt
because one product that I absolutely
loves that I have repurchased a lot is
the hourglass 1.5 millimeter eyeliner
only because it's got like the tiniest
tip and it's super creamy I'm in a
minute I'm gonna talk about that in
another video I'm filming tonight which
is why it's in front of me about like my
most repurchase makeup products that I
keep buying again and again and that is
one of them so that's what I'm saying
like I love drugstore liners but like
that one's amazing and it's like this
big so it makes tightline really easy
okay the Kat Von D shade + light contour
now I do have their eyeshadow palette
I'm gonna be honest since my style is so
different than Kat Von D I mean like
like her approach to life in my I just
feel like we're so different what do I
know about her approach to life I don't
know anything about her anyway but like
I feel like we are very different style
wise and so with that in mind like I
look at like the packaging or stuff and
be like but then I've tried some of her
stuff and it's really good and then I've
tried some stuff that I really didn't
like usually not because it was
necessarily bad but because it wasn't my
like her liquid lipstick I think it's
just a little bit too drying for me
anyway so I tried her eyeshadow palette
I loved it I can link it below it is so
creamy pigmented buttery I mean all that
you want it blend so well but when I
think about like the contour it's kind
of the same as the highlight kit I don't
need contour palette I'm gonna use one
to two shades out of the six or eight
you know I'm talking my any contour
palette out there and so I have a few
like I have one from else it's really
good but do I reach for a lot no because
I only use one shade from it maybe two
and so for me it just doesn't make sense
now if you're a makeup artist it might
make more sense if you're just a
collector or you love Kat Von D or you
genuinely just love contour kits nothing
wrong with that I've heard it's
absolutely amazing I swatch it in stores
I'm like holy moly
I just know myself and I know that I
don't
have that need and I also know yet again
that there are cheaper alternatives
where I don't feel like I need to spend
the money on a contour kit now when I
spend the money on a really nice contour
powder like a single yeah because I
travel a lot and if I know it's really
good or I want to talk about it with you
guys and review it then it's worth it to
me but a whole kit I hope I'm making
sense look that contour kit by the way
is $49 that's a lot for a lot of shades
I'm probably not going to use I've also
not tried the huda beauty liquid
lipsticks they're $20 each I am kind of
interested to try them though I know a
lot of people like love them I've tried
now one thing from huda beauty and it's
her eyeshadow palette the like purpley
one but yeah her desert dusk really
interesting palette still developing my
opinion it takes me a while to decide
interesting I think it's pretty good I
mean I've been using it a lot did I wear
any of this today I think I have
cashmere yeah on my lid but I also put
like a color pop shadow on top of it the
math I really like the shimmers are kind
of interesting you just have to have a
really good primer underneath you got to
be careful with it super lots of I don't
even want to say necessary fallout it's
just a lot of powder that kicks out
because of the nature of those shows but
the huda beauty liquid lipsticks on my
end I'm just again I'm a broken record
I'm I say it one time and I'll move on
I'm kind of over liquid lipsticks I'm
done saying it that's why I don't think
I'll ever buy them that's all find the
boss palettes those are $45 I think most
of them are I have to admit the Laura
Lee was it yeah it was viola Voss and
Laura Lee her pout looked amazing and I
wish I would have bought it I is it
still available it's probably still
available on her site like the violet
boss site now that by the bosses told us
Sephora though it's now more on my radar
sewing room so I've looked at like their
holy grails palette that's the one I've
got like in my loves on sports so that's
when I actually might try have you tried
by Lovaas shadows like I heard they're
really good but then I feel like I don't
hear about him a lot anymore so I'm like
was it just like a I don't know you know
what I mean like everyone's like oh
let's all talk about this and then it
phases out so it's like wait so was it
good or was it not like why are you so
using it
so I'm curious if you guys have tried it
are they weren't that what's the best
violet boss palette out there fiver to
buy one to be the first one I try which
one should be but really the shadows the
colors that Laura Lee picked for that
palette were gorgeous okay another thing
I've never tried is the I've just been
hearing about this mascara ever right
the Lancome most year big mascaras $25
I think it's beauty with Emily Fox who I
adore
I think it's her that really really
loves us so she's who I keep hearing
about it from but I know I've heard it
from other people that is just this
amazing mascara and she is like the
mascara Queen she does these like
mascara tryouts I'll see if I can find
one of her mascara one where she'll try
out like eight mascaras you get to see
them all like literally on her lash it's
amazing and it's got to be so much work
that she puts into it and I so applaud
her for that anyway um so she's made me
want to try that especially considering
how many mascaras she's tried and that
that one's kind of stuck out to her so
that is one that I probably will buy but
again I'm like ooh $25 for a mascara I
love my lash Paradise so much although I
will say I can tell mine is getting
older because today I was kind of
freshening up before filming after work
and I had black fallout everywhere like
I've never seen so much in my life and I
thought was i eating my eyes and i
Michael I think I was but even still I
mean it was a lot so I think it's time
for me to replace the mascara um okay
next one I've not tried the makeup
forever matte velvet plus this is $41
I've heard people talk about this for so
long hey it just doesn't sound up my
alley because I don't love matte skin of
course I'm saying that my skin probably
looks super matte I don't know um I
really don't I mean it just depends like
if I'm gonna wear a wham-bam highlighter
I might mattify my face a little bit
more to make that kind of even itself
out with the route I don't know but
typically I like more of a healthy glow
to your skin I don't like you know I
don't mind if I have a little bit of oil
shining through because I do think it
kind of breathes life into my face and
it makes me look a little bit more
youthful so that one's never really
intrigued and it seems like it's a kind
of watery format am i right I feel like
it's like a war watery format and I you
don't love foundations like that I don't
know what it is but I feel like it just
like spreads over my dry skin and it
never actually covers and I have like
redness on my nose and it wouldn't cover
that so I'm curious about your guys's
thoughts too especially if you have skin
like mine do you feel like it's good do
you feel he's not worth it you know what
are your thoughts so this video is just
for fun I hope it was I guess enjoyable
and watch I'm not sure that there was
much to learn I guess I did bring up a
few products here and there so any
products I mentioned I will link below
if you're curious about them even if
they were products I mentioned that I
actually own other than that I hope
you'll subscribe and I'll see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
