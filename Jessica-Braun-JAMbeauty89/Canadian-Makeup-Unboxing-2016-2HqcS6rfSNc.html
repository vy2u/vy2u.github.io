going to share with you guys a Canadian
makeup haul these are actually things
that a Canadian subscriber of mine named
Sam sent to me in a lovely package
everything was so cutely wrapped I
opened it in my own time and then as I
opened more and more and I read all of
her like notes regarding all the
products I was like oh my gosh
I have to share this with you guys so
Sam thank you so much this was such a
like treat to open one day after a very
long day at work so let's go and get
into it so it's gonna kind of go out of
order I'm gonna try to put it like in
order as much as possible one of the
first things that were in the package
was this nukes Paris beauty kit and it's
got their gel or their face cleansing of
makeup removing gel which I've actually
tried I like it okay but I have not
tried this youth in radiance revealing
hair I think it might be like a serum or
moisturizer I love that they're travel
size so I could travel with them we're
leaving really soon on a Disney trip and
a cruise so I might be bringing one of
those with me we will see so she not be
a bunch of Canadian drugstore products
and a lot of them are still really
expensive products but she also sent me
some Mac things and I wanted to show you
guys cuz I don't do a lot of mac falls
on my channel so I want to show you that
stuff first and then we'll get into the
drugstore stuff so she sent me two
different Mac lip liners and she was
saying you know I might I know you might
be surprised to see Mac here but yes it
is a bunch of backs up and Mac is
Canadian which I really hadn't realized
so the first thing she sent was one of
their pro long wear lip pencils which I
have never owned a pro longwear one I've
owned their regular line which she also
sent me one up but the pro longwear one
is in staunchly stylish and this one is
just a perfect kind of peachy Brown nude
lip liner it's kind of the one I've been
looking for for a long time but I
haven't found because it's gonna go with
virtually any nude color this will
probably be one that I bring on my trip
with me cuz again it will go with most
things it also sent me their regular lip
pencil in the shade talking points and
this is just a beautiful bright pink
shade and
I don't know that I have a bright think
I might have one that I bought in London
but I really really like this color and
it goes really well with the next two
lip products for Mac she sent she sent
this Mac Zac Posen lipstick it's a matte
lipstick and dangerously Brad however
this one really does have more of a pink
tone to it so it's kind of interesting
that it's called dangerously red this is
more of a pink live almost like a
strawberry red maybe is a better
description but I really really like it
and it's a really creamy mouth formula
and then she also sent one of my
favorite things she sent it's the retro
matte liquid lip color and it's in two
matte with love matte ma tte and this is
a beautiful bright matte pink and I do
not I don't think I have any matte paint
quite like this it's a gorgeous hot pink
it does not budge she mentioned in the
note with this that she was like once
you get it on make sure it's exactly how
you want it because once it sets it's
not going anywhere without makeup
remover and she is so right I wore this
out one night and it stayed on for a
very long time I was so impressed and
the color is gorgeous she also sent me
something I was so excited to try this
is the Mac strobe cream and I've now
tried it a couple times and I've mixed
it with my foundation and it just makes
my skin look so glowy without using any
highlighter or anything like that
so this I was so she saw a video where I
mentioned I wanted to try it so thank
you for this it was so thoughtful
the last Mac product she sent word the
Mac lustre drops and this is in the
shade pink rebel and it's just a really
pretty like kind of peachy golden kind
of a highlight and I've used it a couple
times like just right on my cheekbone
and it looks so beautiful and natural in
a way because it doesn't kick it doesn't
have any power so it just kind of melds
with your skin I love this and she was
saying this is one of her favorite
highlights another thing she bought me
was from the brand Vasanti and she was
saying she had never actually tried this
but someone kind of helped her pick it
out this is one of my favorite products
ever this is a façades you see the
light powder highlight duo in golden
child and it's this it's a duo it's got
a lighter shade in a more golden shade
there and alone they're absolutely
gorgeous and pigmented but you could
also swirl them together
and that's what I've been wearing it
it is so beautiful you can put a lot on
to make it really like phantom in your
face you can put a little on it looks a
little more natural it's so beautiful it
stays on all day
and it's such a soft powder it feels
very luxurious she also sent a Basanti
lipstick in game time and this is just a
really pretty it's a berry color but
it's almost like an everyday berry color
because I feel like it's one you could
wear out like to work or even out at
night and it would work both ways
without feeling too in-your-face I
really really like that and it is so
creamy and pigmented she also sent a
Vasanti lip gloss and it is in the shade
it's a lip shine in Tasman and it's
again a berry shade it does have some
glittery shimmer to it and like kind of
a blueshift
but it looks really pretty over that
lipstick that I just showed but it's
also really pretty on its own which she
had mentioned in her card so I love this
I'm excited to try some normally one at
once she also sent them qual products
this one is the quo lip cocktail tinted
lip balm in number one and it really is
just like a lip balm it's like a sheer
wash of light pink it's really really
comfortable on my lips so I can wear
this to work like I want to bring this
to just put in my desk drawer so I can
just throw it on without a mirror and it
looks it makes my lips look alive
without worrying about any color getting
anywhere weird
another quote product she sent is one of
my favorites this is their baked blush
and it's in the shade pitch and I'm
actually wearing it today on my cheeks
you don't need a highlight with it I'm
wearing a highlight but you do not need
one with it it's a beautiful shimmery
peachy pink it's that classic peachy
paint that so many people love but what
I love about this is it doesn't kick up
any powder so it's not getting there's
no weird glitter fallout in weird places
it's a very smooth finely milled powder
I was so impressed with this and it
stays on all day she also bought me this
is it quo yes this is a koala lipstick
in number 10 and this is a deeper berry
color deeper than the one I showed you
before it's so beautiful though I feel
like this is gonna be gorgeous in the
fall and the packaging it's this
gorgeous blue packaging and it presses
in to say I love that
she also sent me some eye shadow things
so she sent me a koala single shadow and
it's the back-to-basics eyes shadow in
the shade Prem which makes me think of
Hunger Games but this is just a classic
neutral color for my skintone would be
neutral for everyone obviously but I
love this to blend all of my eyeshadows
together I've been using it all week and
it's so creamy just a perfect color for
me for that purpose so I really like
that and of course it's matte she also
sent me some Marcel products this is the
Marcel a little quad and it's their eye
shadow quad and jungle fever and it has
these beautiful green shapes to it and
it also has these neutral shades on top
it does have a little bit of fall
they're really really pigmented but you
do need to like tap your brush off
before you apply it because there was a
little bit of fall out a couple days
I've tried it but I really do like the
shades she also sent this Marcel
dual-ended liquid eyeliner pen it's the
double precision liquid eyeliner pen
it's in waterproof which is awesome it's
an intense black I've learned a couple
days this week and I do like it I
realized there's a like there's a brush
tip which is really thin but I realize
it's a lot more pigmented with the felt
tips so that's the one I've been using
it's really easy to get a winged look
without having to mess with it too much
so I really like that and that side
seems to be really black whereas the the
brush tip is not quite as black it's
almost like dark grey you also send me
some things from Annabelle she sent the
smokey nudes palette from Annabelle and
it has ten different shades there may be
three semi matte shades some satins and
then there's one like dark brown one
that has some glitter it's pretty
pigmented it's um I've only worn it like
once or twice so far and I like the
looks it gave me but I do think the
shadows that are kind of like hit or
miss like some are really really good
and some are just like good none of them
are terrible though the brush that comes
with it I love the sponge tip applicator
because it's really really angled so
it's really easy to like do like the
lower lash line kind of smudge which I
do like everyday so I love this it's
been really fun to play with and the
last thing and hopefully I pulled
everything out of my collection I've
actually fill in this video
and the whole thing was super blurry so
I'm literally filming again like a week
later so hopefully I got everything back
out of my collection that she said but
this is the Annabelle expandable mascara
and it came with their Kohl eyeliner and
I haven't opened it yet because I've got
like six mascaras open which is
ridiculous for me for anyone that's
ridiculous so I don't want to waste yet
another one and open it and it go bad in
like three months so I'm gonna wait to
open it but I'll have to let you guys
know maybe on my social media how I like
it
so hopefully this haul was enjoyable for
you I know it was so exciting to get all
this in the mail thank you so much Sam
this is just like Christmas if you're
curious about any of the products that
will list them below if you'd like to
catch some of my American drugstore haul
videos I will link my playlist as well
and I will see you guys in my next video
