to share with you guys seven different
dupes that I have discovered and I am so
excited about them I've actually been
working on this for a while every time I
find something that I think is a dupe I
test it out for a while so I can let you
know about you know does it we're about
the same way you know how what are the
differences what are the similarities
and should you splurge on it if you're
looking for that kind of a product or
can you really save the money and
totally get almost the exact same
product if not better for a lot cheaper
which is always what I'm about here on
my channel I will have the price
difference of both of the products down
below as well as lists and links of
every single dupe I mentioned if you're
curious alright so gosh I love dupes I
always die when like BuzzFeed will post
a thing like a list of dupes but I
always giggle because as I read through
them I'm like okay we all know about all
these dupes like for us here in this
like obsessed beauty community we
already know about a lot of those so I'm
hoping that I have a lot of new ones for
you there might be a couple that after I
had thought I discovered it as I looked
at some dupes on what what like those
people already know so there might be a
couple that are already out there but I
thought I discovered them and then I
realized I didn't and that was really
sad to me but it doesn't matter
let's get into them so the first one is
a dupe for ayo sell product so this was
a product I got a long time ago from
Influenster and it's the YSL it's like
the prettiest compact of all time it's
there to xalapa fector and the idea of
this product is that you can use this
kind of waxy balm to put on areas of
your face that you feel like a really
oily that you need to tame the oil but
what I love about this product is that
you're not tacking on powder on to your
face where you're just going to look
really really powdery especially like if
it's summertime you don't want the sun
shining and showing all the powdery
cakey nests or in the winter where your
skin is already dry and you really don't
want to add any more dry ingredients to
your face that's where these kinds of
products come in it came with this
little sponge not a sponge but like a
powder puff type thing that you can dip
into the product get some of it on and
then you can just put it on your face
and press it into the areas like your
t-zone that you feel like our oily it
really works the first time I have this
I think I had planned to declutter it
like at some point
and I was decluttering because I was
like I'm not using it I don't really get
it well I had seen some video someone
using it I'm like oh so then I couldn't
stop using it but here's the thing it's
really expensive and it gets dirty
really easily because think about it
you're putting this where you can
already see some of the makeup on it
you're dipping this into it you're
putting it on your face then there's
makeup on this so then you need to watch
this then you feel like you need to wash
this too so it just gets dirty easily so
for me I'm like I don't want to spend a
lot of money on this when after a while
it gets really gross and you just kind
of want to buy a new one but that's just
me that's where this product comes in
this is the elf HD mattifying balm and
it is the exact same thing the only
difference is you've got a different
type of sponge this one is a little bit
more spongy the other one is like kind
of soft this one is like a true sponge
so it's a little bit easier to clean so
it's the same thing where you just dip
it into there you get some of that waxy
product onto it and then you can just
put it on your face where you need that
modification it's not a word yeah I
think so I wonder if somebody looked
that up let me know anyway it totally
works the same and I'm going to be
honest with you guys I think it might
work better and the reason I think this
works better is because it's a little
bit easier to get off of the actual
product this is a thicker than this is
so in the end this is creamier so it
applies really quickly you could even
use your hands like if you feel like
you're getting really oily like for me I
know this is going to sound weird but I
feel like I get really weirdly oily
under my eyelids so I like putting
something like this it kind of meshes it
all together it mattifies but it's
somehow like melds into your skin so
nicely that it makes your skin look
healthy still it doesn't look dull and
that is why I think out of these two
honest to goodness you're better off
buying the elf one I think it's a better
product and again if it starts to get
gross and weird a this is easier to
actually just scrape off the top layer
because it's creamier but it's so much
cheaper so you don't feel like you're
breaking the bank every time you need to
repurchase it so for the price
difference of these two I think you're
better off with the elf you're welcome
it's like 1 p.m. and I'm still
Coffee right now that's where I'm at all
right this next one I was also really
really excited about but this one's a
little tricky because price-wise they're
kind of the same so I almost don't know
which to which to call the expensive one
here I'm going to show you both at the
same time this is the Mac strobe cream
this is the smaller size this is the
pixie glow shinde dude they're about the
same price if you buy the full-size Mac
one but in a really weird way these are
the exact same product so if you ever
had like a gift card to like Target
where you could buy the pixie one or
maybe a gift card in Nordstrom or Mac or
something where you could buy this one
the Mac strobe cream in this small size
I think is like around $10 if I'm wrong
I'll put it on the screen but this is
around like $10 but the full-size is
closer to the price of the pixie one I
honestly they're both really really good
they're both that same type of kind of
lotion type primer II highlight II
product but they look exactly the same I
mean do you see a difference here this
one's the Mac one that's the pixie one
they have kind of this whitish almost
lilac shade to them in a really weird
way they both feel the same on the skin
I've worn them both many many times I
feel like I'm wearing the exact same
product like if I close my eyes and put
it on and then looked at myself
throughout the day I would have no idea
which one I put on they add a really
nice glimmer to your skin for a while
again I didn't really understand the use
of these products you can mix them with
foundation but honestly I really like
just putting it on my skin first on a
day that I feel like my skin is just
really kind of dull or maybe I'm wearing
a really mattifying foundation I'll put
this on first just all over and then I
can put that on top and for me it works
if you have really oily skin you might
not like these kinds of products either
way you go it's a win
so my next dupe is the dupe for the Too
Faced milk chocolate Soleil bronzer this
is not the chocolate Soleil this is the
milk chocolate Soleil but I mean really
either way you go but I think this one
is more close to the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer and this is in the light
shade so if you're a more fair skin like
me you would love either one of these
bronzers now the milk chocolate Soleil
is a really light bronzer it
really is but it's a really creamy nice
texture that they don't move throughout
the day it has this nice chocolate type
scent and it just looks really nice and
natural on your skin you never feel like
when you look at your skin you're like
oh my gosh I'm wearing a ton of bronzer
I look like a bronze goddess no it's
more of an everyday natural bronze where
you do look a little bit warmed up but
it's not super obvious the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer has instead of
chocolate more of a coconut smell but
it's really almost the exact same shade
if not exact the butter bronzer might be
a little bit more warm they're not exact
shade dupes but the formulas of these
are so similar the way they look on the
skin is almost exactly the same and they
both last all day
to be honest out of these two I use the
butter bronzer almost every single day
because I feel like it's more
comfortable on the skin and the shade
because it is just a tiny bit warmer
looks even more natural I don't know how
else to describe it so like for these if
I were to run out of one I would go back
to the butter bronzer again and again I
hope they never discontinued this
because it is probably my favorite
bronzer I've ever owned in my life and
the fact that the two-faced one is you
know probably about ten dollars more if
not a little bit more in physicians for
me I can get coupons for they have sales
so that would I would say definitely
wait because Physicians Formula can be
you know thirteen or fourteen dollar
products but if you wait for a sale it's
definitely the time to buy so it's worth
waiting for but it is incredible it's so
smooth and buttery I know a lot of
people are talking about this but this
one is for a good reason there's a lot
of hype around it for a good reason it
is an amazing amazing product it's not
gimmicky at all it's just a great
product next one is a dupe for this it
cosmetics genesee qua lip tint now this
is one of those products where when you
put it on it's a clear ishbal mew can't
see it it transforms your lips into this
nice healthy light pink shade so it kind
of warms up to your lips and it adjusts
according to your lips
well elf has a similar product for way
cheaper and it's in its there I think
it's called like their lip
hello or something again I'll have the
name below but it's in the shade perfect
pink it appears to be almost exactly the
same
however the elf one's a little bit
Pinker and when you swatch them on your
hands the elf one comes off very pink
but when you put it on your lips it's
exactly the same so I almost feel like
the elf one is more reactive quicker to
your skin than the it cosmetics one is
cause of that I end up going with the
elf one more often than the cosmetics
one because I I like to see what it's
going to look like I don't want to wait
five minutes and then see because if I'm
heading out the door I don't want to put
something on and then look crazy so I
really like the elf one because it's
really quickly reactive to the heat on
your lips and you'll even see like when
you swatch it right now it's just pink
but like once I swatch it on my hand it
goes on clear it's right there and it
slowly transforms to that but what's
crazy is when it reacts to your skin it
starts to get the pink on here as well
the darker color and I think that's kind
of cool because it just shows it really
is reacting to that temperature change
so you're seeing it transform right
before your eyes so again out of the - I
like the off one better and I know it's
like kind of crazy but that's why I had
so much fun doing this because I was
finding so many amazing really
inexpensive products doesn't mean the it
cosmetics one is bad it's really really
good it's just really expensive for what
it is and if the elf one works just as
good if not better why would you not
just save the money all right so next up
is a dupe you may or may not have heard
of this is one I thought I'd discovered
and then very quickly when I like had
looked it up in like okay well I did not
discover this everyone seems to know
about it but it's definitely worth
mentioning in case you haven't heard of
it so I love the Mac pigment in tan love
it it is like it might be one of the
prettiest eye products I've ever owned
it's just a loose pigment so you have to
be kind of careful with it when you open
it but swatch out it is the most
beautiful iridescent bronzy champagne
e-everything color I mean it's just it's
a change your world kind of color it
looks unbelievable on the lid you could
just wear it alone you can wear it on
top of stuff oh my gosh wet dry doesn't
matter it's gorgeous but
this pigment is like twenty-something
dollars now you can get a smaller one
for 10 and honestly that would last you
forever but this size is over $20
well the L'Oreal infallible loose shadow
in the shade amber rush is exactly the
same so it comes in a pot where you take
off the little thing and it's kind of
pressed but it's still a loose pigment
but it is kind of pressed and it's just
as ridiculously pigmented so here is the
L'Oreal one and there is the Mac one
they're exactly the same I think maybe
maybe the l'oreal one is a little bit
warmer but then i see it a different
like angle and it doesn't seem to be
their exact
they're both amazingly creamy for a you
know powder product technically
amazingly creamy they do not budge the
l'oreal infallible is totally totally
waterproof like if you're showering it
stays on that kind of a product so I
love these both but honestly you can
save some money and get the L'Oreal one
or you could just get the $10 Mac one
because it's going to last you a million
years but I have to admit I kind of like
the packaging of the L'Oreal one better
because it doesn't necessarily get
everywhere it's kind of pressed so it's
not just blowing powder all over the
place but both amazing if you don't own
either one you need to own one of them
because it is just unbelievable I had to
wipe the swatches off but I did I just
kept staring at it there for just a
little bit longer all right this next
one I am so excited about it's going to
save me so much money
so one of my all-time writer dye
favorite products is the Sela stay all
day liquid eyeliner I have used it for
years I always have one in my collection
and I always travel with it well it's
like twenty-something dollars and so you
know it's a liquid liner it runs out
over time this is it right here it's
just you know a felt-tip one you can get
really precise that's how I do my little
mini wings everyday and it doesn't move
I can trust that even if it's raining
outside the eye liner will still be
there
it'll so be there with bells on well I
bought this to try for my waterproof
drugstore makeup test
video where I tested a bunch of makeup
in the shower to see if it stayed on
this is the essence eyeliner pen and
waterproof same exact felt tip to it
it's only like a couple dollars versus
twenty dollars and it is just as black
if not blacker and it does not budge at
all and the proof is in that video if
you watch it it does not move at all
looks just as black I am so excited
because the seal one is so expensive and
I bought it for years and years and
years when I think of the couple hundred
dollars I've probably spent on these now
I can buy just as many and only spend
like 20 or 30 dollars cuz I really think
this was like maybe two maybe three
dollars it is unbelievable so I don't
know honestly I don't know if I'm ever
gonna buy the Ceylon one again we'll see
but I really don't know that I have a
need to because I have found the exact
same product for way cheaper it works
just as well so you're welcome you're
welcome you're welcome if you like this
kind of an eyeliner pen you will love it
alright the last tip I'm going to share
with you today is a concealer dupe
I love both of these this is the tarte
maracuja creaseless concealer
it's a crazy heavy duty thick concealer
it reminds me in a way of like the it
cosmetics by my under-eye
- getting older and it's almost gone
it's a really tacky concealer so if you
don't like that kind of concealer you
would not like this but if you've got
really dark circles or you know I don't
know you like a really bright under-eye
this is gonna be your BFF it does not
move it is amazing it um I just love it
because it is tacky I feel like it does
take that long time to set and so it can
look a little greasy on your under-eye
so you do have to set it with some kind
of a powder but I love it and this is
one that like I like I said it's getting
older it's starting to run out do I want
to repurchase it I kind of do I love
having it my collection however I found
this NYX gotcha Covered concealer and
it's waterproof and again I tested this
in that video and it did not move this
is so similar for so much cheaper same
type packaging we had to squeeze it out
it's a thick tacky concealer oh my gosh
it's right there so there's the tart one
there's the NYX one this one the NYX
ones in light and I want to say I got
this one in like light it might be fair
it doesn't actually say on here anymore
but similar they're the exact same
texture exact so if you've been if
you've been thinking about getting the
chart one but you're like I don't know
if I'm gonna like the formula get the
next one it's the exact same it wears
the same they're both is thick they've
got it the same I I think Nick's might
have a little bit more of a shade range
to be honest I'm not 100% sure but it's
like five dollars versus twenty
something so definitely get the next one
because if you're not sure if you're
gonna like this and then you end up not
liking this kind of a texture of a
concealer you don't want to have wasted
that much money way better to have done
five dollars and of course you could
probably return either one but still
honestly I don't know that I'm gonna
repurchase the Tarte one now that I've
tried this we'll see but honestly
they're exactly the same so those are
all of my dupes I hope you enjoyed this
I hope it was helpful for you that maybe
you have a couple of items that you can
not get the luxury you can get the
drugstore and know that it's kind of -
the exact same thing I think we all like
I know for me I love having the high-end
stuff but if they're doing the exact
same thing we don't need to spend our
money on the high-end one we can be
smarter about it and save our money and
use that for something else you know
anyway so I hope this was helpful if you
enjoyed this I do dupes videos every
once in a while I love doing them I'll
link any of my other dupes videos down
below if you like drugstore more
affordable videos than I think you would
like my channel that's usually what I
focus on I hope that you'll subscribe
before you leave and I'll see you guys
