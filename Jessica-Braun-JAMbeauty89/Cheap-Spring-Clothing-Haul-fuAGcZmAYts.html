if you recall in a past haul video
pretty recently I had a bunch of things
in the video but one of the things I was
hauling was some clothes from a website
called dresslink and a lot of people
were asking is that a scam like is that
website of scam because everything's
really cheap and it's from China I mean
everything's costs less but it doesn't
mean it's cheaply made and you will see
what I mean in a second so they offered
to let me pick out some more things
because one of the coats that I got
didn't fit me right and I was really sad
about it if you watch the video you know
and it just didn't seem well-made so
when I went on the site again I was like
okay I'm gonna like really take my time
and pick out some things that I think
are going to be good there were reviews
on there so I read reviews of the
clothes you know to really find the the
gems of dress link calm so the link is
below by the way the links for every
single product here is down below so if
you just want one of the things like
this coat that I'm going to show you
first then okay so the first thing I got
now this was a little pricier on there
but it's this trench coat and it is
exactly what I've been looking for you
can see that it's really fitted and it's
got it's just so well made it's got all
these cute buttons it's a classic trench
coat on the back it's got the classic
little it's just so cute it's exactly
what I've been looking for and it's
really really well made I wish you guys
could feel it like all the stitching is
done well the material it's made of is
really high-quality you can tell you can
tell it's like weather proof it's hard
to explain but it fits amazingly the
pockets are adorable it's everything I
wanted and more
and even the sleeves are fitted so if
you've been looking for a coat like that
I am just like shocked by the quality I
was showing my dad I wore it over the
other day and he was like wow
that looks like a really nice coat I'm
like let me tell you about this coat but
I mean it's just so nice like it's
literally my new favorite coat no
exaggeration so check it out if you've
been in search of one that's fitted and
well made because that one just took the
cake and I was floored so onto other
things some of the stuff I've worn
like it might be wrinkly because I was
so excited about these so this is this
adorable turquoise sweater now it's kind
of balloony at the top and then a little
more fitted at the bottom and the
sleeves are like balloony and then
fitted so I always wear it like with the
sleeves kind of pulled up it's very like
80s but it's comfy and kind of breezy
but still warm it's perfect for the
spring to be honest so I've been wearing
it and I just really really like it I
think it's just cute and fun and just
something different than what I usually
wear and again inexpensive so it's when
it's win now another thing I got was
this kind of floral see-through almost
like a Members Only jacket it zips up
and it's just this really cute sheer
light spring jacket I love it the only
thing I don't like I actually cut them
out it came with shoulder pads and I
very meticulously cut them out it was
hard to do but so that's kind of a
downer and like all of this lining at
the top kind of flips out so I might
kind of stitch it down so that you know
out of the two things I've shown you so
far in this it wasn't as well made but
it's really really cute on I wore it the
other day and I got a lot of compliments
on it so I love it and it's breezy for
the spring another thing I got this is
more for fall and winter is this black
sweater now it's a high-low sweater you
can see and it looks a lot wider but
it's so cute with like colorful leggings
the sleeves are comfortable they're kind
of bell sleeves not totally bell but
they're loose all the way down
I just I'm fallen in love with this and
it's really really just comfortable and
for when you're just like walking around
maybe with some cute boots just oh I
love it
like I'm gonna wear this to the pumpkin
patch with the cute scarf and cute boots
I clearly can't wait for fall already
and it's only May oh my gosh okay
another thing I got was this dress now
it's red I picked up red they have a few
colors what I liked was the stitching in
it you can see like it kind of goes
diagonal it's just really cute now when
I actually tried this on it's a little
wider it's almost like a shift dress so
if you've been looking for a shift dress
for cheap this is a good one for you but
for me my hips are the biggest part of
me so it really kind of accentuates
those
not a good way I don't think so I think
I might wear this a few times I might
wear it with like a cardigan over it so
it's not as obvious you know she's gotta
find ways to accessorize right now I
just hit myself in the face with that
tag that's looked around now but I like
that this one okay this one was too
loose
oh my gosh I have no words when I saw
this I was like did I pick that out and
I looked back I'm like I did in person
it looks terrible it's like an ease just
look at it I mean it's kind of
interesting but the back is like this
shiny fabric it literally looks like a
bad 80s pretty and pink dress I laughed
out loud when I saw it like well this
will be garage sale we're having a
garage sale soon on totally and that
garage sale you know what maybe I should
say go for like Halloween I could be
like pretty in pink girl whatever name
is this okay moving on
another thing that I am absolutely so
glad I got this dress I love that it's
this nautical navy blue and white stripe
it's kind of shorter so you can wear it
with leggings I love the coral detail on
the collar that's on the inside of the
sleeves as well it's just so cute I'm
such a sucker for anything nautical or
anything that reminds me of like the New
England area I wish I lived out there
anyway all right next thing I got these
adorable high-waisted black pants now
these are super-dee-duper fitted all the
way down I love them I love the zipper
detail at the top it's so like Greece
you're the one that I want you know I
just I love them again I think those
were under five dollars and they're
really elastic and they feel well-made
same goes for this the nautical dress
shirt type thing I showed you feels
really well-made as well I also got a
few pairs of high-waisted shorts now
these look how cute they have elastic in
them on the back which I'm not a big fan
of but I love the scalloped bottom
they're on the front and they fit really
well they're comfortable they don't ride
up in the wrong places like some
high-waisted shorts do so I really like
these again under five dollars I also
got these pink high-waisted shorts
I loved the seam down the middle of the
legs on
front me in the back it zips on the side
and these feel really really well made I
this was one that I was surprised and
how well-made they feel and both of
these are lined pretty well not
necessarily lined but they're thick
enough especially these that they're not
see-through or anything like that and
the last thing I got which and were it
was I think these are like $2 they're
denim jeggings they're not really denim
they're you know like that stretchy
material but they kind of I don't know
this is something you might get it like
forever 21 for a couple dollars too so I
mean it no big deal
they're nice to have again to go under
shirts but I wouldn't wear them like
alone with a regular shirt because it'd
be like you know anyway those are all of
the things I got from dress like I'll
catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
