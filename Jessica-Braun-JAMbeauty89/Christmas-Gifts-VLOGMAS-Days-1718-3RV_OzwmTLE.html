except for tomorrow as teachers records
day so I gotta input grades and I'm
gonna level all my books because I've
gotten a lot more etc oh but right now
I'm going to the store because I need to
get something for a party I'm going
through now which is a snap holiday
party at one of the one of my fellow
teachers houses so I'm excited for the
Hat and I'm just excited to unwind and
relax yay
also it was pajama day today and I I
wore yoga pants cuz I was like I always
feel awkward in like thin pajama pants
at school but but I got my comfy hoodie
on so that's pretty awesome it was an
awesome comfy day good morrow today is
Friday and it's a teacher work day so
I'm headed to work a little lighter than
usual this morning because it's a little
later because we don't I think we don't
need to be there totally hate anyway I
actually might be late I'm trying this
is a weird morning anyway but the staff
party was really fun last night and I
know that we will have a bunch of the
leftovers for that party here today and
what I heard our principal is gonna be
providing breakfast this morning so I'm
quite excited and starving time I was
like let me make you eggs I'm like no no
no there's gonna be a breakfast don't
don't you waste your eggs on this save
them for tomorrow hey but tonight we're
gonna have my parents over to give them
their Christmas gifts and
make some dinner for them etc so I'm
excited to see them over at our place
and that's gonna be nice and Pinocchio
can see him a little bit because he's
gonna be staying with them while we're
in London so just getting used to them
more and more
I'm gonna miss Pinocchio also look at
this awesome shirt I bought it in Epcot
at the Mexico pavilion there and I
remember posting on Instagram back when
I bought at this past summer saying
should I buy cuz I was torn cuz it's a
kids shirt and so I was like I don't
know my Fit weird and it doesn't fit
perfectly that is for darn sure but it
was totally worth it and I'm really glad
that I bought it but it stunk because
when I posted that I remember I was like
I don't know we left and we went around
like on the other side of Epcot and then
when I decided I wanted to buy it we had
to leave for like a reservation we had
so we had to run all the way back buy it
and then go and it was hot anyway weird
what you remember isn't it also some
early-morning thoughts my friend Lisa
who I work with sent me or gave me as a
Christmas gift this book of daily
devotions and I know not everyone that
watches me is religious or Christian but
what I loved the message in yesterday's
it was talking about feeling empty and
like feeling like you have a void in
your life and not knowing what that is
and I've certainly felt that way in the
past and I think we all feel that way
from time to time but it was just
talking about how God can fill that void
and you know when you reach out to him
and you pray to him and ask him for help
throughout the day you might not realize
it but by the end of the day you're
gonna realize that God has filled that
void and you're gonna feel that
throughout the day you didn't realize
you were feeling less and less empty but
by the end of the day when you're laying
down to bed you'll realize that wow I do
feel fulfilled and I don't feel alone
and I don't you know and I just I loved
that thought that throughout the day
you're not gonna realize it but God is
filling you up with happiness and with
fullness and I don't know that's just
been stuck in my head and I was telling
Lisa about that the other day and she
was just like yes like it's so true and
on those days that I'm feeling so either
just crummy because it was a bad day but
not really for any particular reason
there's no reason for me to be upset or
sad and when I do reach out to God and
just pray I always feel better and not
necessarily instantly better but just by
the end of the day I'm like oh wow my
day really turned around I wonder why
that is and I remember oh yeah probably
because I reached out to God so even if
you're not religious I feel like you can
still take something away from that like
you know whatever higher power you
believe in or you know whatever you just
put your faith in reaching out to that I
think can really make a difference even
if it's not immediate that's all my
wisdom for the day my Friday was stumped
right there's that Sun again so excited
I of course bring in some work home but
grades are in all that stuff I just need
to get some plans together that way when
I come back in two weeks I'm good to go
I have like half my plans done which is
stressing me out because usually I have
all my plans done by like Thursday for
the next week but not this time folks so
that is that anyway so I've got to go
home and in about three hours a little
less than three hours my parents are
gonna come over so I need to make sure
we've got everything we need and
hopefully I don't need to go to the
store I go to the store everyday it's
crazy I know but it you that's all so I
am taking like a 20-minute nap or trying
to and he has been sitting like this for
like ten minutes
starin I think he's waiting on daddy hi
puppy dog hmm all right that's enough
kisses there's enough kisses for one
afternoon I think you're the reason I
keep waking out I think it's your kisses
mmm
I can't sleep with him all over me and
you litter
yes he has brought me every school he's
brought me like five toys leave you
there are my whispies again they can't
hide they don't lie lion wisps yeah when
I was in kindergarten I told tile Tyler

kindergarten everyone called me lying

lion everyone smile Hey No

POW right in the kisser so we've got our
gifts from my parents under there
Tyler's got gifts wrap for me I got a
wrap his gifts tomorrow because we're
doing your big gift cuz I'm like it's
just a waste of wrapping paper so I'm
like I'm sorry your big gift isn't that
rapidly I don't mind it is it what hey
we're really weird and picky about our
wrapping paper - we have to - rolls
