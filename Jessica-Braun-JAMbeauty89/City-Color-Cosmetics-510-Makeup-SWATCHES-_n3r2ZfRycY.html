to bring you guys a swatch video /semi
first impression to review video of a
ton of makeup from City color cosmetics
they recently sent me a PR package with
like all of these eyeshadow shades a ton
of blushes but also to different
highlight and two different contour
palettes that they also sell all of
these are really reasonably priced and I
wanted to share them with you guys just
because there were so many and I wanted
to swatch all of them but mostly because
I was really impressed and to be honest
so I am going to swatch all of the
blushes I had eight different blush
shades then I've got all all of the
shades of their shimmer shadow
eyeshadows but then I also have all of
their highlight and contour ones so all
these will be swatched up close so let's
go ahead and get started so the blushes
that I'm going to show you are there be
matte blush shades and these are $4.99 I
found them online the website I'm
literally on it right now city color
cosmetics calm I have eight different
shades so I'm going to swatch them all
side by side so you can see what they
look like compared to each other because
some of them are really really close but
before I show the swatches I wanted to
say that these are really pigmented but
they also actually last all day I've
worn my favorite shade is blackberry
it's just a really normal everyday color
for my skintone and it has lasted an
entire work day teaching and not only
that but I love that it's matte because
then I can be really picky about what
kind of highlighter I want to put on
whereas when I have a shimmery blush I
kind of I don't know it's just kind of a
frost of color and it's not always
flatter so there are twelve shades in
the B matte blush collection I'm showing
you eight of them four of them before I
don't have or sold out so I'm not sure
when they'll be into stock I don't know
but I'll just show you the eight I have
and currently they're the eight in stock
so I guess that works out let's go ahead
and get into the swatches of all of
these then we'll move on to the
eyeshadows
so there's shimmer eye shadows are $6.99
each which is a little more expensive
than the blushes and if you look at the
pans the eye shadows are much smaller
but they really do pack a really big
punch and not only that there are let's
see four times four
there are sixteen shades I have all 16
shades and I'm going to kind of go in a
rainbow order with the swatches because
again some of the colors are really
really close but they're kind of like uh
they're definitely a powder but they do
have a creamy like texture to them which
I really really like I like using these
on my lid especially like for a really
shimmery wash of color so let's go ahead
and get into the swatches of these
so the highlight trios that they said
they have two different ones they have
the first collection which is a lot
lighter and these are both $8.99 but
they also have one that's a little bit
deeper and so if you're crazy fair you
could almost get away with some of these
as bronzers although they are pretty
shimmery so you'd have to like a
shimmery bronzer but they're all
beautiful
um I think 9 bucks is not bad because
again these are insanely pigmented they
last all day the pans are really large
so let's go ahead and get into these
swatches
so the last thing I'm going to show you
are their contour palettes
now the first one they came out with is
a very warm toned palette these are 9.99
and again it's got kind of a
highlighting shade and then kind of a
lighter bronzer contour and then a
darker one or deeper one but the second
one is a little more cool tone and this
is the one I'm really drawn to with my
skin tone it also seems to be a bit
lighter so if you compare the two you
can see that you know the kind of deeper
shade is a lot lighter the medium one
this one is a lot more yellow tone but
then the highlights this one's a little
more beige and this one's like a pure
white so let's go ahead and get into the
swatches of these as well so you know
this is kind of my first try with City
color cosmetics I think I've had one of
their blushes in the past as I've always
told you guys any time makeup companies
send me products I don't have to show
them if I like them well enough I like
to share them with you guys because I
feel like if they're really good and
especially like these if they're a
reasonable price you should know about
them I want to tell you about them so
this was kind of that case where I was
like man you know I've had a lot of full
line sent to me and some of them I just
never mentioned cuz they're just kind of
wishy-washy they're not terrible but
they're not great but I really was
impressed with these and when I saw the
prices online I was like hmm these
blushes are only five dollars that's
cheaper than some drugstore blushes
right now and frankly this is one of my
favorites I've ever owned this one in
blackberry I just I can't stop using it
so hopefully that was helpful for you
guys if you're interested in more of my
drugstore reviews or my swatch videos I
will link my playlist below I hope that
you'll join our little family here and
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
