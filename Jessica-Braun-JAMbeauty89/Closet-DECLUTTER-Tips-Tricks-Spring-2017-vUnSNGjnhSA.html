very different video for you today I'm
taking you along as I clean out my
closet it's spring I feel like I need to
refresh this beast of a closet we're
moving in hopefully a couple months we
don't have a lot of space and I also
don't want to move a lot of things and
it's just that time of year that you
feel like getting rid of old things
trying some new things out in your
wardrobe so I figured I'd bring you guys
along with me now this video is
sponsored by thread up and so I've got a
box of things that I picked out from
thread up comm and they actually have a
discount code for you guys it is 40% off
your first order I will put all of the
info for that 40% off code down below
but I picked out a bunch of items that I
thought were really good for spring or
they were things that I needed to
replace in my closet or I just wanted
something different but I also wanted to
show you my declutter across I've done
lots of declaring videos here on my
channel and I kind of have a thought
process for it and so I wanted to take
you guys along on that journey as well
as I pick out some clothes that maybe
I'm ready to pass on and get rid of so
this is my side of the closet here and I
really don't have a ton of clothes
because I try to be good about weeding
through things
each season but I do feel like there are
a lot of pieces in there that I could
definitely say goodbye to and pass on so
that someone else can love them so this
is the before and I'll show you the
after at the end it probably won't look
that much different but I will feel
better about it and that's the most
important part so here's my box I am so
excited to show you guys what's in it
okay so these are the pieces I have
picked out so thread up is awesome
because you can type in your size online
and search only through what would
actually fit you because all of the
clothes they sell are like new and so I
found all these pieces from all these
different amazing brands that were just
so fun some of them are really trendy
some of them are just cute and I was so
excited to get these in the mail and
actually hold them in my hand this one
looks so cute it's from American Eagle
if you save a ton of money of course on
these clothes so I'm really excited
about that piece I also thought this was
so pretty for spring this one was from
j.crew and it literally still has the
tags on this one I also picked up some
just black dress pants I like that these
worse
skinny ones and they're from the brand
and Taylor which I love the white and
Taylor pants fit me I love this one this
is just this gorgeous like knee length
skirt that was from H&amp;amp;M that I thought
was just so girly and feminine and
perfect for spring I also picked out
this pink Victoria's Secret Lounge shirt
that I just thought was really cute and
perfect for either working her out
working out or lounging around the house
oh my gosh okay this one's from Lauren
Conrad which I love her clothing line at
Kohl's but it has this gorgeous design
on it and the pattern it has like actual
glitter it doesn't come off or anything
but and then it ties in the back and I
thought that was just so so beautiful
then I picked this out from Express and
it's just like a normal roll blue tank
top but it has this tire on the neck to
the side which I thought was so so cute
and then also I needed some new shorts
so I've had some white shorts and some
coral shorts before but they're just
kind of worn down they don't quite fit
me right anymore some of them are kind
of stretched out so these were from 7
from for all mankind and I loved this
color I loved that it was just a little
bit rolled up and then I love white
shorts in the summertime this was from
BCBG Max Azria so now that I have all of
those to be added to my closet and I'm
so excited about them I do feel ready to
get rid of some things I don't like to
buy a bunch of new things and then just
keep the same thing and just keep
compiling them so let's pull my clothes
out and go through them shall we
so I think this is everything other than
my dresses and I think I have some
dresses sprinkled in here but I just
recently went through those so I don't
know that I'm gonna go through those I
just want to go through mostly my tops
so another thing that's really awesome
is you can order a bag from thread up to
send back clothes that you're not going
to keep and I think that's really neat
and so that is what I'm planning on
doing with all of my clothes that I am
getting rid of right now so my first
rule of thumb is take everything out of
the closet now usually I take everything
off the hangers but this time I am going
to leave them on because I figure I'm
not going to be getting rid of half of
my clothes this time around I've done
that before I can link that video below
this time around I just want to just
kind of weed out those pieces that I
know I'm not getting the use out of
they're just gonna sit there I'm just
gonna end up moving them to the next
place and still not wearing them so the
thought process I have as I continue to
go through it is I ask myself would I
buy this again in a store because if I
wouldn't buy it again that means I don't
really love it enough to keep it because
I'm not going to necessarily want to
wear it again I also ask some other
questions like have I worn this in the
past year because as I go through all of
the four seasons if I still haven't worn
it that means there really has not been
the time or the need for that piece now
the only difference would be if it's
like a special occasion type of thing
like a black cocktail dress well if I
know it fits me really well and I really
like it I just haven't had an event in
the past year that's okay to keep but if
it's a cocktail dress I've kept but I
know I don't really love the way it fits
me then there's no point in keeping it
because that when that event comes
around I'm gonna want to go shopping for
a new one and not wear that one so I
might as well get rid of it and of
course the classic konmari method of
asking yourself does this bring me joy
and I notice some people that sound
silly but it really works for me when I
think about like when I see this too I
just feel like or do I feel like oh my
gosh I love this shirt I want to feel
like oh my gosh I love this shirt about
all of my shirts or at least where I
know that oh wow I've loved a lot of
outfits I've done with that top before
so let's
so I've got a pile of clothes to send
back that I'm getting rid of and even
though I didn't get rid of like a ton of
things let's see I got rid of one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven pieces
I already feel yet again that my closet
is a lot more refined a lot more curated
than it was before
one thing I've kind of realized is like
some of them were just like ripped like
this I loved but it was ripped and it's
such a thin fabric it wouldn't be very
easy to fix without it just ripping
again and since I spent like $10 on it I
kind of told myself like there's no
reason to keep it I'm not gonna wear it
ripped and I know myself I know that I'm
not going to fix it now if you're
someone that you know would then that's
different but if you're like me I mean
just get rid of it Jessica and then
others were just not really my style
anymore as I've kind of gotten to know
myself as I've grown a little bit older
you know each year and each time I do
this I get to know my style more and
I've realized like I don't love button
downs like this I just don't I've kept a
couple that I like maybe with a vest in
the fall or I might like with the
cardigan but like this was one that
really stood out to me and every time I
look to my closet everything I'm getting
rid of here was something that kind of
stuck out like a sore thumb
and I thought like why don't I like it
just kind of made my closet feel stale
so I'm really glad to get rid of these
things I had a couple sweaters that like
this I just don't ever wear this is one
that I have like three sweaters like it
and I love the other ones and this one
was the one I would always pass over so
I figure it's time to get rid of it and
then others that just had stains or
they're just like peplum tops aren't as
in style anymore and they don't look
awesome on me so I'm finally getting rid
of that peplum top I'd had this is just
not really my style anymore it's cute
still and I'm sure if I had it maybe I'd
wear it like one more time but it'd kind
of be me forcing myself to wear it and
then this fur vest was kind of a hard
one to decide on and this is one that
I've almost a cluttered a couple times
so looking at my closet now I do feel
like it is
much more refreshed like I said there
still I mean just about as many clothes
but now I can add in my thread up pieces
and not feel like I'm just adding more
clutter to my closet so I love that I
feel like my clothes can actually
breathe I feel like I can breathe easy
knowing exactly what's in my closet and
just feeling like it is totally ready
for spring hopefully this video was
