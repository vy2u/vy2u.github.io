the 80th time I've tried to film this
video because someone calls or you know
it's just one of those days and if you
film videos you know what I mean when
you're trying to get it done and
everything that could go wrong does go
wrong let's try it again shall we okay
so I'm gonna do a collective haul today
I'm just gonna kind of focus on the
beauty products that I got because the
other thinks it's kind of random in the
video be too long so um first I got um
some mail from a subscriber slash
Instagram followers slash friend her
name's Sarah I'm gonna link her
Instagram down below she's awesome
um and she sent me it was such a
surprise I had no idea she'd already
sent me a package with all these wet
wild house that I've been looking for
and she sent them to me and that was so
awesome and then she just surprised me
with another package so she sent me this
really cute notebook which is great
because I'm constantly making lists I
always have a notebook like in my
nightstand in my purse just kind of
everywhere I go in my car so this is
great it's so girly it's got these
really cute like pink hearts I love it
and then she also sent me this really
cute Nicole by OPI nail polish it's from
the Kardashian Kollection it's car
dashing through the snow it's this
beautiful just like tons of different
colored glitter in there I'm so excited
to use this probably for an accent now I
think it'd be gorgeous and the beautiful
thing is but go with any color and then
she also got me this chapstick cake
batter which I'm really excited about
I've been talking about how much I've
loved chapstick lately
can't wait for the cake batter batter
yeah then she also sent me the color
tattoo and barely branded and this is
awesome because I posted on Instagram
that I hit pan in my barely beige and
everyone was saying this was a good dupe
in fact not a dupe I mean it's the same
brand but an even better version of it
because barely beige is limited-edition
this is barely branded and apparently
it's an even better formula as well so I
am so excited about this it's a nice
pearl color which I use all the time for
my eye base so here's what I'm really
excited about the she sent me the nude
awakening wet and wild palette it's the
only one I've been wanting that I
couldn't find that was left that I
hadn't found yet I guess what I'm trying
to say I am Gork oh I just said I am
gorgeous guys know that it's not that
oh I'm a mess this morning you guys I
have had nearly enough coffee okay I'm
really excited about this soft brown
color right there it's just so pretty
it's what I use all the time in my
crease a color like that so I'm excited
to have another kind of version of that
I love these Sarah you rock thank you
you guys check out our Instagram like I
said I'll link it below okay so I went
to see the s and got some physician's
formula because there was a deal where
it's like six dollars off of every
physician's formula product so both of
these were six dollars off of each of
them this is the eye booster it's a
liquid eyeliner I got it ultra black
I've had it before and I kind of liked
it but that was when I was using it
alone now I typically don't use liquid
eyeliners alone I use them on top of
cream eyeliners just to kind of set them
really excited about this now and then I
also got the shimmer strips custom eye
enhancing eyeliner trio that's in warm
nudes there's a copper there's a bronze
and there's a black so three different
retractable eyeliners I always use like
copper and bronze II colors on my lower
lash line it's a little less less harsh
so I just really like it under the eye
so I'm really excited about that I also
bought a color tattoo in toughest taupe
can't believe it taken me this long to
buy this because taupe is one of my
favorite things to wear on my eye and I
can't I just can't believe it's taken me
this long goodbye honestly so I'm really
excited about that color love the color
tattoos I bought this from a
recommendation from a follower on
Instagram it's the wet wild cover all
foundation I haven't tried it yet I'm
excited to but I'm nervous to you know
um I'll let you guys know how I like it
I will see I mean it is a foundation it
says it's medium to full coverage and
then it says lightweight satin matte
finish it says a lot of things it's
making a lot of claims so we'll see but
this is only like three dollars so you
know I'm kind of excited because if I
love it
that would be awesome right okay so I
also I'll talk about this the such base
it's the set feat brand if you will but
it's their base coat it's a rich filling
one so it really provides a nice smooth
um finish there I tried it with my nail
color today I'm wearing pink blink or
pink wink it's one of those from Sally
Hansen insta-dry really it's a nice
Barbie pink I love it
this was really nice I'll let you know
as I continue to use it if I like it
because the base coat really is the key
to get making any nail polish lasts even
if it's a $1 nail polish or a $14 nail
polish
you know base coats really make a
difference so I went to Big Lots and
found some awesome deals
I found a Julie G nail polish she's a
youtuber it's this really pretty emerald
green which is the color of the year
according to Pantone really pretty it
doesn't I don't see a shade name
anywhere on it though but I'm excited to
try that I've never tried a Julie G
polish because they're not really sold
anywhere near me
I also found a Maybelline Color
sensational lip color I already have it
swatch since I told you I've already
tried to film this video like 80 times
it's called mauve me it's a really
really pretty color I've worn this a few
times already and I use it with a nude
lip gloss on top cause it's a little
darker than what I like on my skin tone
but it looks really nice with the nude
lip gloss so there you go by the way big
luck this was a dollar fifty by the way
and this was only a dollar so what Big
Lots if you have linear you check it out
because they have insane deals on tons
of makeup and a lot of it isn't even
discontinued some of it is but not all
of it is so I also got the brilliant
brunette hair spray shampoo and
conditioner not hair spray they have the
kind for coat treated hair and the kind
of fur non color treated mine is not
color treated so that's the kind of guy
it's called multi tone revealing I'm
excited to give this a try and see if it
really does bring out like my natural
highlights and lowlights will see I'll
let you guys know I'm liking up but it
was a good deal at CVS and I needed a
new shampoo and conditioner um Target up
and uh pray in the cotton rounds for
only two dollars for a hundred that's
the best deal I've kind of found
anywhere for decent cotton grounds so
had a coupon for five dollars off and
this was only $5.99 I bought two I gave
one of my sister if you follow me on
Instagram I posted a picture of stocking
up on all kinds of stuff so you know I'm
not really picky about razors so these
are cute their ship Quatro right right
can't really go wrong I also got a good
deal with a peel away coupon and a
Target coupon for the natural glow I
always get the medium to tan even
obviously I'm not medium to tan skin
tone but the light to medium is just to
light it takes way too long to build
color and you never really get enough
color to even make it worth it
these they're don't streak they now have
less of an odor which is I really
appreciate and it really is nice and
buildable it's kind of mistake proof you
can't really you know I'm really way too
nervous to use any other self tanners
but this really is mistake proof so if
you're nervous about that and give these
a try they run for around eight or nine
dollars sometimes even like 10 or 11
depending on where you are they're
really expensive like CVS so go to like
a target to get those things I also
bought I've been looking for a hair
spray to replace my Bed Head masterpiece
this got to be smooth operator well I
should say my sister told me about it I
tried it then I went and found it in
Vaughn but I had a two dollar off coupon
it was in like the mail for a got to be
product it smells really nice I think
it's kind of a dupe for it because it's
a touchable hold it has a nice smell and
a cute bottle to and it's so inexpensive
so as I use it some more I'll let you
guys know but I have a feeling I'm going
to really like it okay and then the last
thing I also got a big lock that's where
I get my makeup remover wipes these are
only a dollar each for 30 so it's a
month supply so inexpensive compared to
all the other makeup remover wipes that
get so pricey for what they are these
nights they stay moist all the way
through the last one is in it's only a
sticky thing they also packs of 60 for
two dollars and they are let's see they
have like a plastic thing to close it
with the 60 packs but I still notice
that they're drier towards the end so I
always go with the 30 packs for a dollar
and they stay moist all the way through
the end and that is all that I am going
to haul for today umm but I hope you
guys enjoyed this and let me know if you
want to see a haul with the other stuff
that I have recently bought like um some
shoes and it's just some other jewelry
and accessories and things um let me
know if you do want to see that if not I
might not haul it but anyway I will see
you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
