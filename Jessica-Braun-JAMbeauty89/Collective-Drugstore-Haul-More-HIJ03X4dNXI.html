and I got I got a Bloggie here can you
guys see him come here Simba he wants to
play he has literally a leash and he
wants to play tug of war do you see this
oh I just posted like a really short
video on Instagram which by the way it
is awesome that Instagram now this video
it's so much fun but I've just Doodlebug
last night where you gonna sleep okay so
that's enough hi everyone Oh cute Oh
Jesse he's a good boy anyway loves to
lick though he will lick your leg your
arm your toes for as long as you let him
we could do it for hours I think anyway
okay so today I have a haul that's good
it's like random like it's from like
weeks ago and like yesterday and like
you know so get ready to enjoy this one
so first I'm gonna start with some books
that I've gotten I have a bunch of
beauty products coming up in a second um
the books first I bought this one before
my trip to New Orleans it's uh is
everyone having fun or no hanging out
without me
bye Mindy Kaling and she is one of the
writers from the office and I love this
book I read it in like two days I love
the office she has a new show called the
Mindy project and oh my gosh it's
hilarious and if you like the office and
you like um well and you're a girl then
you'll love the mini project I'm not
sure if you're a guy I don't think
you'll really like that show though
I love it I love her she's so funny and
she's very different than her character
on the office which I was glad for
because circuit on the office you know
it's just kind of annoying so the other
books I got from the store called Half
Price Books it's a used bookstore except
for they have a lot of brand-new stuff
too and they'll always have like really
good deals on like bestsellers like
after their prime you know what I mean
so they'll be like a dollar so I got
Water for Elephants which I've never
seen the movie I like to read the book
first so that's what I'm doing
and then I also bought the help these
are both like a dollar so cheap they're
literally brand new like the spines
aren't even broken I love that so I'm
gonna read these before I ever see the
movie and then I also got one fifth
avenue bike
miss Bushnell and she's the one that
wrote the Sex in the City novel and the
Carrie Diaries and all that but I've
never actually read those books which is
kind of funny but I love those shows so
I figured this would be a fun like kind
of beachy girly type read same with this
one this is called chasing Harry Winston
it's by Lauren Weisberger and she was
the author for the novel of Deborah
Wears Prada which I did read which is a
fantastic B treat if you're looking for
one so I'm excited for those speaking of
books I mentioned this in my history men
on his bone he's so cute on my travel
I'm like getting packed with me video
these magnetic bookmarks I've already
taken a bunch out but they're so that's
like $3 they're so cheap they just
magnetized they fit this is the book I'm
reading right now and it just fits right
in there it doesn't fall out there's
like one side that has like an arrow so
like where you are it's got an arrow
they're just so cute and they have these
are just high heels but they have like a
ton of different kinds they have like
spiritual ones which like a lot of like
Bible verses I was thinking about
getting those and they're like bigger
which is kind of nice too but anyway
they're awesome magnetic bookmark search
for them so at the hotel in New Orleans
that we were at I thought it was gonna
be Paul Mitchell products because a lot
of Marriott's have those but these were
mapping body works aromatherapy orange
ginger and it's volumizing shampoo and
conditioner and says energizing and this
smell is very like energizing it's
citrus but it's toned down by the ginger
and you can really smell the orange and
the ginger and it's a really really nice
smell I really like it it has the body
lotion as well i mean i didn't i used it
maybe once or twice it's just lotion you
know but uh so if you ever seen any good
deals on these about the body works hey
let me know be it's worth the try cuz
they smell good it really did kind of
add some volume to my hair i really
enjoyed using him while i was there and
when i travel i try to use the shampoo
and conditioner there cuz it's nice that
they're provided and you know a lot of
times it's really nice one so yeah so I
snagged those before I left
let's see another thing this is actually
something my sister gave me because she
didn't like it was the end
I see city curls curling brush mascara
and I saw it at the store it was like
two or three dollars but she bought it
cuz she was trying to get her lashes to
curl a little bit better and um you know
the brush is all right it's kind of
curved yeah it's kind of curved bigger
thing it was okay like if you're really
in a pinch and you need a really cheap
mascara it's alright but it's just
really hard to work with like I
literally had to like work out it's like
five minutes like I'd have to let it dry
and then do it again and get rid of
clumps and you know it ended up working
it was okay but I didn't notice that my
lashes were any more curled than usual
it was just you know it was just okay so
I don't think I'd ever purchased it with
my own money but it's fun and I'll
probably try it a few more times just to
see if I can maybe it's one of those
that's better after it's right out for a
little bit longer you know okay another
thing I got at Target recently I think I
had a 75 cents off coupon from Target
calm it's their eye makeup remover
they're up and up grand it's good I mean
it's the kind we had to shake it up and
I just put it on a cotton pad wipe it
off it really works well to get off my
like with the rocket mascara can
sometimes be hard to get off it always
takes it off well I don't like lose me
lashes or anything like that so I like
it it's alright I mean I'd buy it again
if they were a good deal cuz you know
it's not bad I think I paid like under
five dollars not too bad
okay another thing that I got is this
Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid makeup
I've never had this before and I've
heard kind of mixed things but mostly
good and I'd I it's one of those
products that I know you guys know what
I'm talking about you go to the store
and every time you're like walking
around the store whether it's like CVS
or Target you always like look at it and
maybe even sometimes you put it in your
cart but then you always put it back or
you just walk away from it you're like
no you know I finally bought it cuz I
had a two dollar off coupon like a
Target coupon and then a dollar off
manufactures or vice versa I think it
was the other way around so I could
stack the coupons and so I got like
three bucks off so it wasn't that bad I
paid under ten for it and it's like a
twelve or thirteen dollars something
like
so I'm parched for coffee hold on
parched now I'm just like tired anyway
so I went to Big Lots and I got some
well I got this makeup brush they always
have the London Soho brushes and this is
a blush one I've never seen I already
have a lot of their eye brushes that I
got for like two or three dollars there
and they're really really good they're
really soft and I use them all the time
but this one is not as soft as those
it's not to say that it's not soft but
it's not as soft as I wish it was but um
it's got a nice shape it's like flat and
then it fans out and it's okay I've used
it like once or twice I'll continue to
use it and see but it's cute like I'm
digging the bright pink and how it's
real thin and long loving that but um
yeah so we'll see y'all use it some more
so more things I got my favorite makeup
wipes I talk about all the time it's
tough I'm not sure how to pronounce that
FPL or peel I don't know brand but it's
a green tea once it's $1 for 30 you can
even beat that and they're great and
they smell nice but then I saw a new
scent and its citrus and I'd never seen
citrus I've seen the aloe one and a
cucumber one and I don't like the smell
of cucumber and then like an unscented
but citrus so excited to try these I
don't want to Openings I won't drag him
out but I really want to know what they
smell like
I bet they smell so good okay so I also
got these ponytail holders dollar 50 for
like a jillion yeah 32 but it's a ton of
black ones without the metal and then it
also has these cute like gold and silver
ones I was like those are adorable so
I'm really I usually end up using the I
got some right here like the kind I got
from Etsy that's like the tied thick
thick elastic but these are nice to have
on hand to like for the gym and things
like that um and I also got this lash
blast volume for three dollars and fifty
cents check that price tag right yeah
and I'm assuming the only reason it was
there they had a ton of these and it's
in the shade very black it was because
it's in the Olympics packaging and I'm
kind of wishing I'd bought more than one
I might go back but I have a ton of
mascara
that I'm like that are like waiting in
the wings for me to try and I'm so
excited so I feel like I shouldn't get
too many but then again it's kind of
Awesome
and I've actually never tried this and I
know everyone like a lot of people love
this so I'm really excited to give it a
try I feel like I will like it because
it's got kind of like a brush that
reminds me of like the rocket so I'm
excited to try it I think that's all and
look this pod is needed
he just need the boy come here's me plug
oh he's so totally here did you guys see
that's not that just flew out of his
nose he's so sleepy anyway we'll leave
