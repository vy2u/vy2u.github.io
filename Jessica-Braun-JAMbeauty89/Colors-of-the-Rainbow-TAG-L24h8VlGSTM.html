going to do a tag video and I'm gonna be
doing the colors of the rainbow tag
which was just recently kind of started
and it's kind of fluttering around
YouTube and I thought that is such a fun
tag especially in the springtime and
year everything's kind of more colorful
anyway so it's just a happy time and
this is a happy tag so I'm excited so
basically the tag is that you pick out
some of your favorite things but they
all coincide with the color of the
rainbow so you pick something red orange
yellow green blue indigo violet and then
also pink and then multicolored so here
we go so I'm going to start with red the
beginning of the rainbow so the first
thing I picked and this isn't 100% solid
red but one of my favorite things that I
used to travel with is this Sonia Kashuk
like travel bag it's almost like a mini
duffel bag if you will because it's not
that big it's about as tall as my
forearm but when you it's got like this
side pocket here and I feel like there's
something in it there is there like
travel boxes in it um anyway but it's a
it zips up and then you can open it and
opens really really wide and it's got
these it's got all this the fabric
that's like really easy to wipe away and
it's got all these pockets inside of it
so it's great you can keep things kind
of separated and like I said it kind of
opens really really wide and so you can
fit a lot and it's long enough you can
fit like full-sized hair sprays in it I
ended up using this more for like
overnight type of things but this is
great also for travel
I just don't bring as many full-sized
things when I'm traveling like via
airplane so I can fit a lot more in this
that's for sure but it's great Sonia
Kashuk always has some really nice
travel bags and makeup bags and they the
patterns change like every season I got
this on sale of course but there I think
they usually run for around 20 to 30
dollars but they really are well-made
and they always have really cute
patterns too so that is my read item my
orange item is kind of orange it's this
perfume it's my absolute favorite it's
Miss Dior and I've talked about it
before in my makeup collection video
which I can link for you guys if you'd
like to see it but
Tylar my boyfriend bought this for me
when we were in Disney World and Epcot
and we were there right before Christmas
so it was one of his Christmas gifts to
me and I loved it and I loved the smell
and now both of us associate this smell
with Disneyworld
now I want to like spray it I just love
it it's a very strong smell so you
really don't need more than like one
skirt maybe two skirt squirt maybe two
but it's just great they'll smell lasts
a long time and I just love it it's a
really nice feminine smell but it's not
too fruity and it's not too musky it's
kind of a nice balance between those two
so I really like it and the bottle is
cute too so it's win-win there okay
let's see we've gone red orange yellow
again this one's not 100% yellow but
it's one of my favorites and I haven't
mentioned it yet
it's the Dickinson's original witch
hazel and you can get witch hazel I mean
so many brands sell it I've even seen at
the Dollar Tree but this one I got at
Walgreens and they sell a lot of
different they have a witch hazel face
wash which I like but I don't Ida
haven't repurchased but this is really
nice it comes with the ton I think it's
around five dollars and this is just
great for razor burn it's great for just
obviously as an overall toner for your
face I don't use toner every single day
but I find that this is a lot less
drying than alcohol-based toner so this
is great it's more natural than other
toners so I definitely recommend witch
hazel if you find yourself with dry skin
after using other toners this is a great
one I really really I love that I've
repurchase this quite a few times for
the past few years and this one bottle
lasts like forever because again I don't
use it every day okay so my green
another face product it's the freemen
facial clay mask with avocado and
oatmeal and it's just that it's a green
clay mask you put it on you let it dry
for a little bit and then you wash it
off with warm water again I don't use
this all the time but when I do it's
just really nice my skin feels really
soft after using it I feel like it does
kind of purge my pores a little bit not
a hundred percent but my face does feel
a lot clearer and look a lot clearer
after using this so I would say I use
this maybe once a week maybe usually
like once
every other week I would say but I like
it again you can purchase that at
Walmart I mean any drugstore I think
sells that I really like it and it's
like three or four dollars okay for blue
I have this shirt from Target and I have
a few things to say about the blue
column I wanted to feature baby blue
because I've been wearing so much baby
blue I have a lot of baby blue earrings
and bracelets in this shirt and I just
really like it it's a nice alternative
to mint because I love mint green and I
own a lot of mint green things but it
doesn't look that great on my skintone
and I find that baby blue looks a little
bit better I'm saying that but I'm
wearing like mint shorts right now and
it looks alright but I don't know I was
just excited for kind of a change from
mint and baby blue is everywhere right
now but these shirts I also wanted to
mention because they're just great
target sells them they're under $10 they
have tons of colors and patterns
and they're the best things to wear in
the spring and summer because you can
just throw them on you know how they'll
fit they're comfortable they're not too
snug and they're not super expensive so
you're not worried about if something
happens to them or if you're sweating in
them or you know what I mean
they're just great they're so versatile
and you can dress them up and dress them
down so I really recommend going to
Target picking some of these up I've got
a few colors and I wear them all the
time in this summer cuz they're just
easy
they're easy to just throw on okay so
for indigo this is the closest thing I
could find and it's one of my favorites
it's this sleep what do they call it
it's from Bath and Body Works it's there
aromatherapy collection and it's a sleep
body lotion it's in the cents off milk
and honey I already have a backup of
this purchased I leave it on my bedside
table and I use it every single night I
use it on my hands and I use it on my
neck in this area because the smell
really does relax me it's probably just
a placebo effect but it does and I
really like the smell and now I kind of
associated with sleep so I just it's a
very calming feeling and I really really
like this lotion again like I said I've
already repurchased it so I really love
it oh I love it so much
okay so for violet this isn't really
violet but I really this nail polish I
mentioned all the time because I love it
it's the Sally Hansen inside rag which I
just Instagram a photo of like four of
these shades that I have that are really
similar and I just love them but this is
in the shade lively lilac and it's just
that a nice lilac color it's just so I'm
not wearing it on my nails today it kind
of looks like am but I'm not it's just
such a pretty color I actually like this
formula I used to not but lately I have
been I like the way it applies and they
have so many different colors and
they're like three or four dollars
they're not expensive sometimes it's
more expensive like CVS but really love
this color one of my favorites I think
if this ran out I probably would
repurchase it because it's my favorite
lavender II lilac colored nail polish
that I own or that I found so I really
like it okay so for what we'll do pink
the Beauty Blender
I waited so long because I didn't want
to buy it because I was like it's
expensive for what it is like it can't
be that great blah blah blah blah blah I
found a good deal online for a 2-pack oh
my gosh you guys like I can't speak
highly enough about this Beauty Blender
you get it wet you squeeze the excess
water it grows a little bit and then you
just apply your foundation it's a
flawless coverage I do use it today I
just love it like I can't speak highly
enough about it if you're kind of
teetering on the edge I would say buy it
I've never heard anyone say a bad thing
about the Beauty Blender I absolutely
friggin love it okay last thing multi
color this is my umbrella that I love
and it's Vera Bradley my sister got it
for me and I think having a pattern
umbrella is just so fun because you know
when it's rainy it kind of at least for
me it kind of puts me in like a funky
mood I'm like it's rainy like I here I'm
not gonna look good you know there's
tons of things that go along with having
a rainy day so having a fun like
multicolored umbrella it's just like a
little extra shine in your day you know
what I mean and this one they're really
it's really well made but I love the
pattern it's like that dark with the
purple and green I just really like it I
feel like this is one of those patterns
if I had picked it out I wouldn't have
picked this one out but now that I have
it I've fallen in love with it so
definitely recommend looking at Vera
Bradley's like umbrellas because they're
really cute and it's just a happy little
slice to your day especially if it's
raining out
you have to have an umbrella anyway and
plus I end up like actually bringing it
with me more often than if I just had a
plaintiff row that I really don't care
about you know that I don't have it
because I never bring it and then it's
all rainy anyway I'm blabbering so I
hope you enjoyed this tag and I'm
thinking about doing a follow-up video
where it's colors of the rainbow nail
polish edition so let me know if you'd
like to see that in the comments down
below because I think that'd be fun to
show like my favorite nail polishes
according to the color of my favorite
red my favorite orange polish etc I
think that'd be fun so um let me know if
you'd like to see that and I will
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
