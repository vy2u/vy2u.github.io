bringing you a review of the color pop
blushes that are now out they are called
the super shock cheek and they are eight
dollars apiece and I have five different
shades here I'm wearing one today so
we'll go ahead and start with that one
I'm going to show you swatches of all
five of these but then I'm also going to
show you a demo of me actually applying
this in two different ways you can kind
of get an idea of the best ways to apply
this kind of a product the formula of
these is different because it's like a
cream to powder finish it's creamy and
you'll feel that when you swatch them
like you could push your finger and it
would could push all the way to the
bottom of the blush but it's very
powdery once it's on so it's a really
cool formula so stay tuned if you're
curious about how to apply these so the
first one I'm going to show you is
called prenup which is one of my
favorites and this is just a really nice
simple everyday rosy pink cheek this is
one of their satin blushes they have
both satin and matte and this is one of
their satin ones and you can see today
there is a little bit of a glow around
it I don't have any highlight on or
anything like that so there is a little
bit of a glow on these but not enough
that there's I mean there's no
detectable shimmer or anything even when
you look at the swatch you can see
there's no shimmer to it but it's not
completely matte I love the satin
formula the next I'm going to show you
is called trickery and this is a really
nice peach toned blush and the thing
about this one is I noticed it goes on a
little more sheer so you can build it up
if you want but I think if you are fair
like I am and you're but you've been
looking for a peach blush that doesn't
make you look crazy I think this is a
really nice option because it is more of
a sheer wash you can see in the top of
these two swatches is just with one
swipe and then I built it up like three
or four times with the bottom swatch
again that is another one from there
satin line the next one I'm going to
show you is called thumper and this is a
little bit more of a brighter pink than
prenup was this is one of their matte
blushes and again it doesn't look that
much different than the satin ones but I
do like this one for just a little bit
more of a bright look especially I think
if you're going out at night and you add
a really nice highlight on top of it I
think this would be absolutely gorgeous
and you can I mean as I kind of blend it
out you can totally control how much you
apply which you'll see here in a little
bit when I do my demo these last two are
a little bit deeper so this first one is
called between the sheets and it's more
of a dusty kind of deep brownish red
color again this is from their matte
line and it this is the color that I
think for my skintone as I shear it out
it looks a lot better but I would
definitely have to be careful with one
like this because for me when you're
really fair this can tend to look a lot
muddier than it would on someone with a
deeper skin tone I think this would be a
really pretty option if you had an olive
complexion just because I feel like
those would complement each other really
well
the last one I got I think is more of a
bronzer and I was pretty excited about
this one starting my hair is a mess
because I let it air dry and I don't
know what to do with it to be completely
honest with you okay
so the next one is aphrodisiac and it's
more of a brown I mean just like a
straight-up Brown it does have a little
bit of a red tint to it but this could
totally be used as a bronzer especially
if you do have a deeper skin tone I
think for me I have to be really careful
with it but again it's totally workable
or you could just use it as a very
neutral blush either way I think it's a
really cool option now I'm going to go
ahead and leave into the demo where I
show you how I apply it and after that
I'll go into kind of the nitty-gritty
details of the pros and cons of this
product so I picked my favorite which is
prenup I like this for my skin tone and
it's that really pretty pink one who I
can't talk today so I'm going to do one
cheek with a stipple brush and the other
cheek I'm going to use a regular blush
brush I'm gonna do the stipple on this
side so I'm just gonna stipple it on iam
and I'm just going to press it into my
cheek I might have to rub it a little
bit yeah now this time I'm going to kind
of swirl it maybe pick up a little bit
more there you go so you can see a
little more of the color it still
applies a nice even wash of color and
I'm just kind of put in an era where but
it's such a pretty pretty pink color and
I think for my skin tone in the
springtime it's just really really nice
now I'm going to use the blush brush
these are both real techniques by the
way and just get some on there and so we
pit back mostly just focusing on the
apples of my cheeks but sweeping it a
little bit further back and the reed
like applying it with both of these
because either way you have a lot of
control I know I've got a break out
there just calm down everyone but I
think as I'm looking at this now I think
it does apply better with this Dipple
brush um just because you have a little
more control and you're in control of
how much is on there a little more than
with this where it's tapered and it's
really not meant for this creamy
consistency so I think a stipple brush
is your best bet but I think it does a
really nice job of applying it but I did
want to show it to you with a powder or
a powder based blush brush so you could
get an idea it still works but I do
think stipple brushes are a little
better I love the Real Techniques one
with this blush because it's a little
more dense
I love the elf stipple brushes but I
don't love using them for this because
it's a little too flimsy I think for
this formula so like I said before the
price point of these is great it's eight
dollars a pop and they'll usually do
like free shipping when you spend $30 so
you could get some of their eyeshadows
you could get a blush or two and maybe a
lippy things like that so there's a lot
of amazing products that they do sell I
have done a color pop swatch video &amp;amp;
demo with their eyeshadows which I can
link below if you're interested where I
show what those are like and how they
are best applied as well I do think
these are an excellent option if you are
going to place an order
anyway you should certainly get these I
would say it's worth placing an order
just for these blushes because they're
different and they have so many
beautiful colors and on top of that they
last really well throughout the day I
don't own any products that are like
this I don't have any cream to powder
blushes I have cream blushes but those
are completely different than these and
frankly for me cream blushes even the
ones that I love they don't stay on
throughout the day the way that these
are I don't think these are as
long-lasting as a regular powder blush
like some of my favorites are the balm
their blushes stay on all day matte
blushes stay on all day elf studio
blusher stay on all day as do the NYX
powder blushes those don't budge these I
think last very well but they don't last
as long as those other ones do these
don't really have a noticeable smell of
course the texture is really interesting
on these and if you haven't swatched one
of their eyeshadows or blushes it's the
same texture as the eyeshadows very
creamy and just weird it makes me think
of squint in a way if you've ever played
with that it's the sand that when you
put it in water when you take it out of
the water it's instantly dry it's just
odd I do think that these for the most
part you they're all hits you can't
really miss with any of these however
some of them do go on a little sheer
than others which again I don't mind
because I'd almost rather it be a little
sheer that I can build then it'd be
something crazy I do think the best way
to apply it is with a stipple brush I
kind of converted myself in this video
because I had been applying it with just
my regular blush brush but I realized
that it really does look better with
this Dipple brush so that's what I would
recommend
I like the Real Techniques one but elf
has some that are like I had mentioned
earlier they're good and I like them for
other things but I think this one works
a little better for this the packaging
is of course adorable it's just the
white packaging with the name on the
back and then the lid that screws on
they do say to keep them closed tight
tight tight and to not leave them open
for too long
because it will dry out it is a creamy
texture I'm tightening all of mine right
now it is a creamy texture overall what
I recommend these blushes yes I think
for $8 that's absolutely drugstore price
range and frankly in the drugstore
there's not a ton of great blush options
there's certainly nothing with this
formula out there so I would definitely
recommend them I love love these blushes
I really liked their eyeshadows there
are some that I like and some that I
don't like as much but I do think it's
worth it and eight dollars you know even
if you were just to get one I would get
prenup it's the most beautiful in the
universe if you were just to get one
find a color you know you would wear
every single day and eight dollars is
really a small price to pay for a really
good blush so I hope that video is
helpful if you're interested in more of
my drugstore reviews and demos or any
other reviews and demos that I've done

guys in my next one bye
