doing a quick review of the colour-pop
line and when I say line I mean just
some of their shadows and then some of
their lippie stix cuz really they don't
I think that's all they offer at least
right now and it's kind of great because
that just means they're super focused on
perfecting the formula of those two
things
oh no they do offer lip liners as well
but I didn't buy any of those because I
feel like lip liners they might be
amazing but there are so many amazing
lip liners that you can really get one
at any price point I don't know I wasn't
too concerned about it so color pop let
me pick out $30 worth of stuff for free
which is really nice of them so is nice
because I was able to pick what I wanted
but no this is not a sponsored video
they're not paying me to say anything I
just wanted to show them to you guys and
I also am going to show you my eye look
that I used all the for shadows that I
have here in a second so stay tuned I
also showed the application of this and
how I feel about how it applied so it's
kind of like a first impressions demo
video anyway the lippie stix that i
picked out was Lumiere which is the one
that Kathleen lights here on YouTube
helped to kind of curate if you will to
pick the color I don't know and then the
other one I have is el bebé and then
before shadows that I got and you'll see
the swatches of these lipsticks here in
a second the four shadows that I got our
girl crush which is this taupey color
here and it's a matte formula which I
really like I really really like it
awesome for the crease that's how I
applied it which you'll see here in a
sec hustle is the next shade that I got
which is like this deeper purple with a
little bit of a red tint to it I used it
on my lower lash line today which I
thought was kind of fun
sequin is the next shade that I got
which I am absolutely in love with such
a gorgeous almost like amber rush from
the L'Oreal infallible line and I used
it kind of lightly on my lid this and
the next one I used on my lid and the
last one I got was I heart this which is
this gorgeous kind of white gold shade
but when I applied it it applied a
little more sheer than I'd anticipated
which you'll see so now that you've seen
the up-close swatches of these shadows
I'm going to show you how I applied them
for this look which is a really simple
which you know for me makes sense and
that's what I usually do so it just made
sense to me so I'm going to show you how
I applied it hey I know I look crazy
right now every time I get to this point
in my makeup where I've done my face and
I've done my brows but I haven't done my
eyes I always laughs I'm looking at
myself in the mirror because I feel like
I look like a freak is it like just
crazy because I got nakey eyes with
strong brow so I will certainly look
more normal I promise
soon but I wanted to try a few of these
that I just showed you and actually
applied in my eyes and let's just see
how they look when they're actually
applied because I could show you
swatches all day but sometimes that just
looks completely different on your eyes
when you apply them so I'm going to
start with a primer this is the wet and
wild Fergie take on the day eye shadow
primer and I would compare this to the
Too Faced shadow insurance except for of
course the Too Faced shadow insurance is
way more expensive in this a lot cheaper
but in my opinion they're the exact same
formula and they work just as well so
it's just like a liquid kind of cream
you don't need very much in fact I think
I've got too much I want to dab a little
bit off on my thing but I'm just going
to apply it to both that way I mean the
shadows might be amazing on their own
but I do this every day no matter what
so for me to be able to compare it to
other shadows that I use I need to know
how it does with the same primer that I
typically used you know what I'm saying
girl okay so it's blended in I think
what I'm going to do is try I heart this
on my lid because it's just a really
pretty shimmery shadow and then I might
find a place to throw sequin in I don't
know and this end might end up looking
crazy
I just don't know and then I'm going to
use one of the two darker colors there's
like the taupe one and then this hustle
I might use this one to like maybe line
my lower lash line or something and then
girl-crush which is that other one I was
telling you about maybe I'll use in the
crease but it might be too dark I don't
know let's just see so since these are
such an interesting almost gel like
consistency I'm going to use my fingers
for a lot of it because I just feel like
it'll have the most intensity that way
so I'm just going to get a little bit on
my middle finger here and apply it to my
lid oh well
it certainly is shimmery but it's not as
um I mean I know this isn't like a color
color but it's almost sheer in a way so
that's kind of surprising so I'm going
to add another layer and I'm just
pressing it in I'm not really like
rubbing it across except for in these
corner areas where I don't want to get
it everywhere trying to see I notice a
little bit of fallout and that could be
just because I'm patting it in and if
you applied it with a brush with like
maybe some water or some mac fix+ on it
that would probably prevent a little bit
of that so let's go ahead and do it to
the other eye as well
I can't describe this consistency every
time I use it I feel crazy because it's
like it I can't tell like is it it is
like a cream almost and like when you
push against it kind of balances back
like if I were to push really hard it
would go all the way through does that
make sense it's so cool and weird okay
so I think what I'm going to do is get a
little bit before I do I to make this
look look uniform I'm going to use a
different shadow just to be like a
medium buffer color in the middle so I'm
going to use Mac Omega here it's just my
favorite go-to shadow just to kind of be
in between to make it all blend together
and you can get just sloppily I just
kind of softly apply it all throughout
my crease all the way up to my almost
all the way up to my brow bone I guess I
should say
also if my face looks greasy I'm trying
out some BB creams right now for a
different review video kind of all
hidden if killing a few birds to one
stone
so my face with teary seats because I'm
trying out this BB cream and I'm really
not sure how I feel about I'm trying out
two different ones actually anyway so I
think what I'm going to do is before I
do anything else to my lid with this
amazing color I'm going to use the girl
cross shade and maybe do a little bit
right in my crease let's see and this is
a matte shade and I'm just going to
focus it right in the crease I'm not
really going to go too far above or
below it just kind of deepen that area
it seems to apply really nicely I wasn't
sure if it would kind of blend nicely in
there because of its consistency but
it's doing a good job I think I'm going
to go back with this brush and just
blend those together a little bit or at
least try to so now I'm going to go in
with sequin and I'm just going to dab a
little bit on the kind of outer corners
of my lid just to keep that white in the
center of it just kind of add make it a
little more interesting I'm going to
take just a naked fluffy brushes to
blend all of it and I'm kind of blending
lighter on the lid I'm not really
pulling it because I don't want to get
rid of all that color
so now I'm going to throw on the bottom
part of my lashline I haven't lined the
top yet I'm going to use hustle just to
add some definite see this what I'm
talking about when I push my brush into
it it instantly did that dent all the
way in so it they really are like a gel
now I could line the top with this same
shade but really the black liner I'm
going to put on top is going to cover
completely anyway so I'm not going to
worry about it for this look but you
absolutely could especially if you want
more of a soft lined
look I'm impressed with how well it
blended together because I thought for
sure it wouldn't blend as well as it did
so that is pretty surprising there's not
I mean there is a little bit of glitter
fallout here but not as much as when I
use any other shimmery shade that I have
of other brands so I'm impressed with
that as well I think that's a testament
to the the consistency of it just
because it is more gel light almost like
a cream it sticks together a little bit
better okay so now that my eyes are done
I do want to do my lips and and the two
shades that I have I have Lumiere which
is the one that kathleenlights helped
pick the color or whatever and then I
also have el bebé and they are both a
matte lippy stick and I think today I'm
just going to go with Lumiere because I
love the shade I love the idea of it so
again sorry about my note that's so
funny
it's very it seems upon first glance
pretty creamy especially for a matte lip
so let's just see how it applies I'm not
going to use a line or anything because
I just want to see what it looks like I
had a chapstick on earlier it's kind of
blended into my lips which is probably a
good thing so let's go ahead it's a lot
darker than I envisioned and more purple
it's going on pretty smooth I just can't
get over the color the other one just
for swatching sake since I'm not gonna
apply to my lips is LBB and it's a
little hold certainly darker but it's
more of a wine color which is really
pretty it's really pretty so I just
tried to wipe these off just with the
dry washcloth and they're not going
anywhere most of them which is probably
a good thing same goes for the lippy the
lipstick swatches umm so the price of
these are all $5 which if you don't know
that by now you do now they're all $5
which i think is really cool because for
this quality of shadows it really is
amazing um you can get them online
I think it's color pop gum or something
I'll put the link below it's just the
regular website link um I can't think I
try I'm trying to think of a similar
product to these and I really can't
because like I said they're not quite a
cream shadow but they're also not quite
a you know just powder shadow it's like
something in between ah I can't
it's just I've never experienced
anything like this and like I said if I
were to push deep into this if my finger
would go all the way through because
it's just they're so bouncy and gel like
that's so cool um this is something
that's almost worth buying one for just
to feel what I mean because when I Tyler
was with me when I first tried it and I
was like Tyler rub your finger in this
like it's like what like seriously this
is unbelievable and I can't believe only
five dollars I think the packaging is
really cute I like the white it's a very
clean look but they don't get dirty
because it's more of a you know plastic
you feel and they're just cute I mean I
feel like that's part of the reason I
wanted to try them alike they're just
really cute and I know everyone talks
about it but I want to try them to the I
didn't notice a you know a weird smell
with the eyeshadow the lips kind of do
have a smell I almost like a vanilla ish
smell but it is a little different and
the first time I applied it I was like
ooh like it is a little I don't know
it's just a different smell it doesn't
bother me too much it's not like the the
Milani lipstick smell
just can't do I wish I could because I
love those lipsticks i can't not like
that bad but it's just it's noticeable
in my opinion the eyeshadows you know
they don't feel like they're on their I
think they they certainly stay where
they go I mean that is proof they are
not going anywhere even without a primer
of course I primed my eyes with it in
the lip product it feels really nice it
does feel almost sticky and you can kind
of see here I'll zoom you in you can
kind of see when I pull my lips together
that they kind of take a second to pull
apart watch it's kind of like and not
sticky sticky but just a little bit
sticky I think for application of these
I don't think you necessarily need a lip
liner with it which I thought was really
cool because I thought for sure I would
now maybe with the darker one you might
want it but with this I didn't feel the
need for it because it's not it's not
moving and that's one of the benefits I
could see how this might start to feel
drying because even though it is pretty
creamy especially when you swatch it I
feel like after a while I mean it
already is kind of showing every line in
my lip which a lot of matte lipsticks do
so I could see how this might eventually
be drying but it feels really nice right
now and then the best way to apply this
I think is either with your fingers I
mean you could just do it with a brush
obviously which is what I did with the
like the girl cross shade in my crease
but I also feel like you could
absolutely do it with a wet brush just
because if you want that crazy pigmented
look especially with the shimmery ones I
think that'd be a great way to apply it
so overall what I recommend these yes I
can't even really think of like a
cheaper option I've heard that maybe
hard-candy has one that's similar to
this but there I was just at Walmart and
they're like I want to say like 6 or 7
dollars like what so although I think
there might have been two in that pack
so you might be able to find cheaper
dupes but honestly you guys these are 5
bucks
I think that they have a deal like
always where if you spend $30 you get
free shipping or something like that I
can if I find any coupons or anything
I'll certainly write it down below but
you know it's really not that expensive
and if you're wanting this is kind of
like just treat yourself kind of thing
because you can't find in a source you
do have to take the time to order them
but I think they're really good
if I were to recommend one of these I
would recommend I heart this because I
think it is the most wearable shade out
of the ones I got of course they've got
amazing crazy colors but I just think
it's such a pretty pretty champagne e
color so overall would I recommend it
absolutely of course I would I think I
would recommend the shadows over the lip
products so obviously I was able to get
these for free from them but I am
probably going to go back online and buy
my own more shadows because these really
are amazing would I buy some of the
lippie stix I don't know I think they're
nice but I don't think they're I don't
know I can't decide really yet but I
really do like this color because it's
different than anything I own and I have
a feeling I'll be wearing it a lot so
thank you kathleenlights for picking out
a color that we all could wear and it
actually looks really cool
hopefully that review is helpful I know
this is just added to the millions of
color pops watch videos and first
impression videos and all that but now I
get it I didn't realize how cheap they
were so when I kept seeing all this
stuff like ah I don't want to spend $20
on a single eyeshadow and then I looked
it up and I was like wait they're only
$5 so I'm definitely gonna be going on
and buying more of these because they're
amazing okay so hopefully that review is
helpful definitely check out my reviews
playlist I do a ton of drugstore reviews
here so check them out and I'll catch
you guys in my next one bye I'm like
nervous to do it in front of you would
it be honest with you like do you even
watch my videos or the what like what
was the last video you watched mine
