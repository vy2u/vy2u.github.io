my November favorites let's go ahead and
get into it
so I have been doing vlogmas like crazy
and I'm really enjoying it and a lot of
you guys that usually don't you guys are
telling me that a lot of you guys don't
usually watch vlogs but you're really
enjoying it so I'm glad that you are and
that was kind of the same for me I
didn't really get why people watched
vlogs but last year I started just
randomly watching a couple people's and
I was like okay these are actually fun
to watch
it's really weird it really is weird so
if you've never watched something you
definitely should not necessarily you
have to watch mine although be awesome
you did you don't have to but I mean
just someone you really really like
watch their vlogs you'd be surprised
cause it's really weirdly fun to watch
their life and I always learned a lot
from people's vlogs like just about
random things like the way they do
things like oh I should try that in my
own home you know things like that so
I've really been enjoying that which is
why this November favorites is so
delayed because I've been kind of busy
doing that but I'm like okay I got to
refocus because makeup is my game so I
met the person I'm going to show you is
this little case for your Beauty Blender
I have been looking for something
because if I travel with my Beauty
Blender I always feel gross putting it
in my makeup bag and then zip it right
up all wet and gross but this way
there's little holes in the bottom so we
can like breathe and still dry out but
it's got two little things on the side
it says everyday smile on the back and
they've got a couple colors and it's
just so cute I was like yes so I thought
I think it can fit the Real Techniques
one this one I mean it should be able to
fit any of those kinds of blenders so it
doesn't really matter what brand you
have oh I'm just now realizing I could
put the everyday smiles with the face in
the front just probably how it should be
I don't anyway I was impressed it's a
really simple idea but kind of an
important one if you've been looking for
that and it's adorable so if you want to
store
and it Beautyblender I can't say that
booty blender and then just put it like
over on your vanity it's so adorable so
I think this is something that was very
needed in this market awesome ok another
favorite is this mascara favorite you
guys I have tried a lot of mascaras this
is one was actually one of the very
first high-end mascaras I ever purchased
for myself way before I had a channel
and it's the Lancome Hypnose drama and
I'd always heard it was amazing well it
is amazing I cannot stress that enough
the but it's that simple brush I mean
there's nothing crazy about the brush
it's not waterproof which is good cuz
waterproof and me just don't mix well it
just stays put and it keeps my lashes
curled and I've got more compliments on
my lashes the past few weeks wearing
this that I ever have in my life because
it actually holds the curl it separates
it doesn't clump but it gives enough I
mean I I can't say enough good things
about this everything I want my mascara
to do this does that's all safe so if
you're wanting to splurge I mean you
guys know I'm a drugstore girl but when
a product is amazing I'm gonna tell you
about it whether it's expensive or cheap
and this is amazing the next product is
one that I think might be a dupe but I
want to do a dupes video on it this is
the Sonia Kashuk brightening powder and
this was I think around $10 at Target
and it's just a powder that you can use
to brighten any area of your face it's a
loose powder very finely milled it has
kind of this sparkly quality to it which
I used to not like there it is there
it's just kind of white but you blend it
it really does brighten I've been using
it under my eye area and I just like it
now when you get up close you can kinda
see the sparkle so that's gonna bother
you then you would hate this don't even
don't even try but it's so slight and
it's so finely milled that I don't think
it's obvious enough to turn too many
people off and it really does brighten
and I think that helps it brightens so
you could even use it down your nose
right here
I really was impressed and I think it
might be kind of a dupe for the Laurie
laura mercier brightening powder which i
just got and you'll see in a haul soon
but i wanna
compare them and kind of put them to the
test before I say that it's officially
is okay another favorite is this is a
rediscovered baby this is the Milani
shadow eyes it's probably under five
dollars the shade is almond cream and
this I have had forever and it hasn't
dried out it sharpens easily it's just a
crayon and they have other colors you
probably can't even see it because it's
pretty close to my skin tone but it is
amazing at just a primer I literally
though do-do-do-do-do and then just
blend it all in it gets rid of any
discoloration on my lid on my brow bone
anywhere then once I've done my eye
shadow I'll put it right under my brow
and just blend it in whether it's with a
brush or my finger and it just really
helps to define that area you can also
use it like on your lower lash line like
your lower waterline to make your eyes
pop there's so much you can do with this
and it's so inexpensive they have other
colors but this is just the one that
over the years I've kept and loved
another favorite is this blush this is
from benefit and it's their blush called
Dallas it's kind of a bronzer II blush
color and that's what turned me off and
so I had tried all of I think I've tried
almost all of the box blushes this is I
love them all and that really is the
truth they all stay they're all
beautiful they smell nice and the
packaging scoots got it all going for it
except for it's expensive but this one
is the first one that every time I put
it on a month oh yeah I like that I'm
wearing it today it's very natural but
you can also glam it up but I like this
because when I'm wanting to go crazy
with my highlighter or microns or
whatever I can wear this and know that
the blush isn't going to come back with
it so for that reason alone I love this
but I just like it I traveled with it it
might be the blush I bring with me to
London which that says a lot because I'm
gonna pick something that I adore any
new next favorite this Milani amore
matte lip cream I thought I was gonna
say it the wrong way there I have it in
the shade lust 0-4 and it's this
beautiful pink
I'm not wearing today I know it looks
similar to what I'm wearing I'm wearing
Revlon lipstick in pink in the afternoon
but it is such a beautiful lip color it
dries pretty matte I would say it dries
completely matte or at least to a semi
matte it's not dry now I love the color
these are so comfortable on my lips I've
been looking for a matte lip cream
that's comfortable and this one is so I
want to still get other shades but
they're hard to find around me so but I
love it super impressed and it smells
nice and isn't the packaging just like
classy I love that next favorite is if
you've seen my winter like secret
weapons video for dry skin I've talked
about this skin and maybe you actually
sponsored that video but they don't know
I'm making this one this is a favorite
of mine you guys it's their primer spray
and I have struggled with primers for so
long because I would use you know like
regular silicone primers or like
lotioning primers and just I felt like
it never did anything like I would put
it on and think oh so-and-so says this
is amazing so it must be so I put it on
and then put my foundation on oh my god
didn't look good next day I've tried a
different way I've just never been
impressed and I'm like why do people
wear primer deputy I just and so I just
wouldn't wear them well this stuff like
you spray it on your face and it's
almost like it kind of makes your skin
look a little bit better like a little
less red but then you let it dry and
then you put your foundation on and it
just sticks to it and it doesn't move
and then they're finishing spray which
I've always liked I wasn't going to
mention it in this video because I just
always already liked this and already
shared that with you guys but then you
spray that on top of it after you've
done your makeup and I used both today
I've used both every day for the past
couple of weeks they're amazing and I
can't say enough I won't talk about any
more because I I've already done like a
lot of talk about it it's amazing
two more favorites so this one wild by
Fergie highlighter this is called
Hollywood Boulevard and every time I saw
this in stores I was like no like I'm
gonna hate that cuz it's like yellow and
pink and got a little bits of brown
that would not mesh with my skin at all
I was wrong because it first of all it's
a huge pan it's really inexpensive
it's crazy glittery but you can blend it
to be so nice it looks dark but when
you're putting it on with the brush it
just looks so beautiful gosh I swear
troops that just makes some of the
lipstick in with it
I swear whatever I'll make some of the
best highlighting powders it's so funny
but they really do this one in the
reserve your cabana one that I love
they're both two of my favorites and
they're both by wet and wild so this is
one that I was impressed with it just
looks nice it can look patchy if you're
not careful so I usually use a very like
a smaller more precise brush to get it
where I want it and then use a different
brush to blend it that way it's not just
blending everywhere because it is so
shimmery but it's beautiful in speaking
of shimmer my last favorite is this Mac
pigment in vanilla
I wore this I've been wearing a lot
lately I like to spray like use a
setting spray on my brush and then dip
it in here and it's just a loose pigment
it's really really a glittery white
pigment and this size is only like I
think it was like 10 bucks and then I'm
never gonna go through this I mean you
use so little of it and I'm not big on
pigments I don't think I own any other
ones right now I think I got rid of them
all because I wasn't using them this one
I'm so impressed with I'm wearing it
today on my lid although it's kind of
packed on top of a lot of other colors I
was just playing well I'm getting ready
today anyway so impressed with the color
and if you wear it on its own it's just
this stark beautiful just astounding
glittery white it's beautiful and it's
so perfect for the holidays so those are
all of my favorites for this month I
hope you enjoyed off links for
everything down below and I would love

been loving this month I think we would
