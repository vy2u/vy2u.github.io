declutter okay not all of this because
these are setting sprays I don't know
that I'm doing that right now but all of
my foundations this has gotten
completely out of hand
to the point where I'm like so
overwhelmed that I just want to you I
mean most days I just want to use my
favourites like this BB cream is one of
my favorites so I'll just grab this and
do it like every single day so I'm gonna
pull these out kind of line them up make
it easier to kind of see them all and
we're gonna go through them I'm gonna
get rid of some and if I'm a little
nervous because I don't know I just get
nervous I love foundation so much but I
also know obviously they go bad so let's
just do this okay so if I counted
correctly I've got 67 foundations here
oh my gosh I really I know that I'm
still gonna have a lot at the end of
this but I really want to try to cut
this in half because yes I know I'm not
going to use all of these and the
realist in me is sickened by this but
then the per you know I know that this
is one of my jobs and that obviously
these are not all things I've purchased
with my own money a lot of them were
sent to me in PR or you know or I was
buying them for a video specifically my
problem I know that I'm gonna run into I
run into every single time is when I get
to a product that I really don't know
yet how I feel and that's really
problematic for me with my job because I
don't want to get rid of it without
knowing for sure did I hate it did I
love it is it mad so I think what I've
decided I'm going to do for this
specifically is make a separate pile of
foundations that they're gonna get tried
one more time now for some of those it
might be more than one time but it
should be rearranged so with that in
mind I'm gonna have that separate pile
that way
I think I'm literally gonna put them
right up on my vanity not even in a
drawer so that over the next week or two
I'm gonna try each one and decide that
day if I know enough to get rid of it if
I know enough that I love it I want to
keep it or if I still need more time
with them so that's kind of gonna be my
remedy for that because that way I think
I'll feel too bad with some of these
just getting rid of them just like that
without trying them let's start the way
I always start
pull out things foundations BB Creams
that I know I love love love and that I
use all the time so I would never want
to get rid of so let's see oh hold on
let me rearrange a bit all right my
favorite product is my Missha BB cream
I'll link my favorites down below
probably not gonna like every single
thing I mentioned but this is the
perfect cover BB cream I have the shade
number 23 which is darker their shade
range is terrible but the coverage this
is like the most beautiful BB cream so
I'm definitely gonna keep this but I
think the next time I buy it I want to
try number 21 and see how that looks on
my skin very great toned but I kind of
like it on my skin so that is an easy
keep and I'll show you at the end what
I'm keeping what I'm giving away this
has become a favorite of mine this is
the cosmetics by bylines foundation it's
just a very moisturizing foundation and
I found that in winter my skin really
really liked this the coverage is I
would say maybe medium it's bill it's a
little bit buildable but on my nose for
example sorry Pinocchio my dog is
chewing a bone right back there loudest
could be but he's so happy I can't even
disturb him
anyway I I really really like this stuff
so I think I used to have a couple
shades and I must have gotten rid of
them and just kept this I'm in the shade
light another easy favourite my eight
cosmetics CC cream absolutely love it
also in the shade light again I want to
try the one down maybe I think the next
one down is fair and see how that one
looks because I think this is just a
little bit dark for me right now by
lemare foundation this is your gonna die
when I tell you this it's crazy that I
completely forgot I own this it got
shoved to the back of my drawer I got
some new products and I was trying out
literally forgot about it until just
this moment when I'm staring at it so
that makes me sick to my stomach because
I know how much this is like a hundred
dollar foundation and I really liked it
and so definitely gonna get my money's
worth and use this so definitely keep it
and I did really really like it again I
still feel like I'm developing my
opinion on this because I don't want to
give you a half-hearted opinion I really
want to know how I feel these are some
easy keeps for me these are the cover FX
custom cover drops I have a lighter one
and a darker one so for me a lighter one
is in ten and then in 25 is a bit darker
so I can I
only use this for changing the shade of
foundation you can make moisturizers
like take a moisturizer and mix this
into it to make your own kind of tinted
moisturizer or you can wear it alone his
foundation I'm not a big fan of that
formula for my face but I love this to
change the shades because you'll see a
lot of these are definitely too dark for
me all right let's just start going
through these because I'm starting to
feel overwhelmed so this is very new to
me I think it's too dark this is the
Tarte shaped tape very controversial
because of their shade range or I should
say lack of it I have it in the shade
fair light neutral eye I definitely want
to try it out just know how I feel about
it just so I can compare if anyone asks
do I am I gonna do like a separate
review on this or anything no but yeah
so I just recently you know I really
haven't tried it but it has the giant
doe foot I have the hydrating version I
actually quite like this I'm gonna put
this in a maybe at the end because I I
think the shade is definitely too dark I
can just lighten it but I actually
really did like it and I haven't tried
it in a while so I'm gonna put this in
the try me
pile same goes for this this is the
Becca cosmetics aqua luminous perfecting
foundation
it's got like a dropper this I bought on
HauteLook and I checked the batch code
and there's nothing wrong with it like
it's it's not old or anything but the
first few times I used it I really
didn't like it so again I want to
continue to try and make sure I know for
sure that I don't like it and if I
really decide that then I'm just gonna
declutter it these two elf foundations I
have porcelain and sand it's time for me
to get rid of sand it's too dark and I
really don't need two shades of this
right now so sand is going to go and
frankly that one's pretty old and then
I'll keep porcelain this is one of my
favorite foundations it's like six bucks
I was just I wore it like twice this
week I absolutely adore this stellar
foundation is another one I've only
tried a couple times I remember the
coverage was not great I really did not
like it how it applied with the sponge
but I haven't tried it yet with a brush
it's there well it doesn't say what it
is but it's it's the just the stellar
foundation that's on
for its website so going to put it in my
to try pile to decide this Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD is really really good
I liked the older formula I got to stop
saying that though because it's been
years since it's been around so it
doesn't really matter I thought them but
I have it in the shade y2 25 again I
think it's a little deep for me but I do
like this I just wore it the other day
so this is what I'm gonna keep is it my
holy grail no but do I really still
really like it yes well yeah so far I'm
only getting rid of odd this is terrible
so here's the problem I have these I've
got another one where is it here
these drugstore foundations are ones
that I feel like I've hardly tried like
I I knew both of these I really didn't
like so honestly I think I can get rid
of these I remember really not liking
these so this is the all my best blend
forever this is the Revlon insta filter
they just they didn't have great
coverage they didn't blend as well as I
wanted ironically and I don't know I
just wasn't impressed with them there
are too many other good drugstore
foundations out there so those I'm going
to go ahead and pass on these three
however look at the difference in shades
is crazy
these three however I'm gonna put in my
to try as well because I know I've tried
all these a couple times but I really
don't remember exactly how I felt I know
that this Milani one I did lie I think I
liked both of the I want to say I liked
all three but again going to try I know
I'm gonna sound like a broken record in
this video I'm so sorry ahead of time
this alia one I don't know I had asked
you guys if you were interested in me
doing like a review of this brand it's a
new brand of Sephora I I don't know I
haven't really been impressed with many
of the products but I guess that
shouldn't stop me from doing a review
because I want you guys to know that so
I'm gonna keep it again try it again and
once I'm ready to actually film a review
of the brand I'll be able to include
this in it and then probably declutter
it was I just aren't being so so two of
these naked skin one and Duns I don't
think I need both of these so I think
I'll keep light and get rid of medium
light this is more of like a BB cream
and a lot of people it's like their Holy
Grail I like it enough that I definitely
want to use it some more but it's
certainly not a Holy Grail so I can pass
on
along with this these are these like
kind of hydrating tinted moisturizer
things from this brand that came with
this tool Oh color me I just I tried one
of the shades and I just didn't like it
so no pass those on easy peasy lemon
squeezy
this Ulta one I didn't like I did my
whole Ulta brand review where I tried on
a bunch of products for you guys I
showed you and told you my feelings
after trying them for a couple months
and this is one that I know a lot of
people do like I think it's just a
little drying for my skin so mmm I want
to pass it on now I've three shades of
this Physicians Formula healthy
foundation so do I need all three no a
giant doffo which is awesome that's just
fun and I think the packaging of these
is so pretty let's just see
that's probably closer these definitely
have a strong smell it's not the worst
smell in the world but it's definitely a
strong one so definitely these two are
closer to my skin tone so I think I'll
definitely pass on the eat darker one
but I think I might keep those two
because I feel like I could I think I'm
gonna keep lc1 and pass on lw2 I mean
they're honestly they both work for me
so I just don't need two of them so this
is the Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating
tint this one also has a doe foot
applicator and I do like this it's not
the highest of coverage but it is
comfortable for just like a quick throw
it on your face kind of a thing so I'm
going to hold onto that so rearranged a
little bit here so these cushion
foundations I like them light ivory this
is wet and wild light ivories my shade
so I'm just gonna pass these two on and
keep them my shade Physicians Formula
love velvet foundation is comically
wrong for me shade wise this is in the
shade ivory so gonna pass that one on
alright so I've got these NIC the NYX
total control drops in the glossy a skin
perfecting skin tint the glossy ones
getting a little old and I do like it
but I'm gonna try this one again the NIC
what I'm gonna keep I just recently
purchased and I like it this was a
letdown this is the cargo one base
concealer foundation in one the idea is
that instead of putting foundation all
over your face you could put this just
on the area's you need it and blend that
in and that'd be enough but it just
didn't really do anything for my redness
so I was like hmm I don't think this is
a product for me so I'm going to pass
that one on
and when I say pass on you know
depending on the level of use some of
the things I'm going to donate some of
them I'm you know if they're really used
I'll let my sister's go through because
I know they don't they typically
wouldn't mind and friends and things
like that so that's kind of the and if
it's really old I'll just toss it so
okay this lift and luminate is pretty
old I feel like I should get rid of it I
mean you can just tell and I love this
foundation so much but it's just time
these mark freaking Jacobs foundations
were horrible now I will say this I want
to try one of them I want to keep one
because I've heard a lot of people say
no the trick is you've got to do this
you've got to do this like straight with
Mac's mac fix+
so I haven't tried that yet but they
sent me these I know this one's too
pinky so I'm gonna pass that one on fare
130 fare 110 I think I'm gonna go with
fare 110 and if I need to darken it I
can but I think that's again a little
bit too pink so I'm just gonna keep the
one oh I did not love that foundation
another foundation I did not love was
the Urban Decay Naked skin again so many
people love this but it just never looks
good on me so I'm finally this is so
hard because I've held onto this for so
long because I'm like oh but it's urban
decay and it seemed as expensive and
like everyone else loves it but it's
just something I can't love and I need
to accept it move on and pass it on to
someone that will love it oh do I have
to Illya foundation so Jessica
definitely gonna go ahead and pass on
the more yellow one which is the shade
Tularosa so that one can go okay said
I'll keep this one this one is if you're
curious the shade is called Sonora the
lighter one I might get rid of pile is
looking bigger than my keep pile so far
so that's that is awesome
alright I don't need both of these
Rimmel lasting finish
2500 breathable I just recently got
these so I definitely still want to try
them you swatch I've tried them once and
I did like it again this has a doe foot
as well that's clearly the new trend
which is kind of nice I think it makes
application easier although when you get
to the end of the actual foundation
there's gonna be a lot in there that
you're gonna want to try to see this was
the problem one was to light woman's to
dark so I thought well I'll keep them
and mix them both because when I mix
them it's actually a really nice shade
for me but perhaps it'll be easier to
keep the darker one and just lighten it
with my custom cover drops so maybe
that's what I'll do so this darker one
by the way is 103 true ivory and the
lighter one was 81 fare ivory so I think
I'm gonna keep this one and get rid of
the lighter one and just lighten it if I
need and the reality is this will
probably be perfect in the summertime
too so works both ways I have two of
these ultra Repair tinted moisturizers
and fair and light C neither one of
these are open these are brand new i
gosh Ferrer is gonna be dark enough gosh
that's almost orange as it is so there's
no way I need light which I'm sure will
be a step darker than that so I'm not
even gonna open the light I'm going to
pass that one on and keep the fair so I
can at least try it out I do have a new
one of the number seven lift and
luminate it's actually a different shade
let's compare they sent me this a while
ago this one's the new ones in cool okay
won't you rip in the box Jess this one's
in cool ivory and the one I have is warm
ivory and actually cool ivory does look
like it might be a little bit better for
my skin so keep the new one I'm gonna
pass this on spray on osmotics I tried
it once and I just like yeah so I'm like
well why mess around with it let someone
use it won't still new it's got a SPF 45
which is really nice these two I really
like they're more BB creams that I
genuinely like a lot I do think I need
to use them up soon because I think
they're starting to border on a little
being a little too old you know what I
mean I know they're fine now because
I've used them recently but it's
definitely gonna be soon so in the next
six months I want to use these up and
then pass of well or
probably just throw them away I have two
of these two-faced peach perfect I
certainly don't need both I've got
porcelain and vanilla oh my gosh that's
porcelain what I liked this foundation
but I remember this being the problem
these were far far far too dark just for
me again I can lighten so I'll certainly
keep the lightest of the two which I
guess would be this one porcelain and
I'll just have to lighten it which is
fine that's why I own the custom cover
drops but still looks like whoa that's
so keep porcelain pass on what was this
vanilla all right
speaking of shades I have two of these
number seven stay perfect I'm gonna keep
warm ivory and pass on cool ivory in
this because just looking at it I do
think this one's a little more neutral
for me even though it's called warm
ivory so I'm gonna keep warm ivory pass
on kalari this is another favorite
favorite foundation period and it's a
little more it's closer to drum store
price and it is so beautiful on the skin
medium to full coverage wears really
well throughout the day just gorgeous so
you will notice I have a thousand of
these Rimmel foundations this is the
American version without the pump I'm
gonna pass this on to a sister that I
know will use this because my lovely
Canadian sisters two people have sent me
the Rimmel lasting finish in my shade
one hundred ivory and which one have I
actually use this one's unopened this
one is opened yeah so I'm going to keep
this one in here and I'm gonna put this
in my backup drawer because I freaking
love this stuff so much you know what
that's making me think
well no but this one was already getting
a little old or was it I had one and
then I like it was old and then I bought
a new one I don't know if this was the
new one but I want to say they've
discontinued this in favor of their new
line what the they're breathable but I
am praying that they did not get rid of
this line because this is one of my
favorites so I'm still gonna pass this
one on to his sister but I'm excited to
keep this this backup alright we're
getting closer
so this vial is healthy
sir from covergirl I actually really do
like so I'm going to keep that I don't
think I need both of these hourglass one
sand shell was my shade so I'm gonna
pass on buff but my favorite you'll
notice it's the only stick foundation
that I have it's my favorite this one's
still pretty new to me the barbell
foundation I I do like the CC cream
better like way better but it still
really is nice it's got decent coverage
for basically being a tinted moisturizer
it's got decent coverage I just like the
coverage better on this and this the CC
cream wears better but I do like both so
I'm definitely gonna keep both alright
so this Jiwon she has been such a not a
what's the word for it
it's had mixed reviews that's what I'm
trying to say on YouTube they sent me
this quite a while ago and perfect
vanilla is my shade and I really like it
now this is not a high coverage
foundation it's a very kind of
moisturizing simple foundation but I
just like the way my skin looks with it
now I don't need these two shades so
I've got shade number five and six
I don't need shade number four is
perfect so keep this past those two on
Jessica I'm so proud of you I've been
holding on to these sheets like well
maybe I'll use them some other time but
I mean the reality is I'm not going to
now this double where I have an acrux I
am struggling to find my true shade in
this but I'm gonna keep this because I
do like it I just lighten it with my
custom custom cover drops so boy it
sounds like I'm sponsored by like cover
FX custom cover drops I swear I'm not I
just I really taken to using that you
see anyway these I just recently was
sent and I'm really enjoying and I
actually am like mixing all of these
shades so I don't know that I'm ready to
get rid of any of them let me just watch
them let me get an idea these are so
liquidy and I'm really struggling to
find a way to get these out of the
bottle without absolutely getting it
everywhere other than like doing it with
my finger over it obviously ooh that one
might be what is this one this one's
cool
buon but see the problem is they're all
such different undertones that when I
mixed them I think this is the one yeah
this is fresco in fresco is super
neutral and I loved that and I know that
sounds crazy but it it is so nice on my
skin I don't know what it is about it so
especially when I like started mixing
some things so maybe I will see this is
what I mean I feel like I need to keep
all three I know for sure I'm keeping
fresco and cool bone because cool bones
probably closer to my skin tone but I
need this to kind of balance it out so
maybe I will pass on ecru because I do
think just like the other ecru that I
have of the regular line but that's not
far off for my skin tone either when I
mix all three it's like the most perfect
shade so I'm just gonna keep all three
that's just what I'm gonna do okay so
these are the foundations that I'm
keeping in my try it now try it this
week pile I'm just gonna literally have
them on my vanity to make sure I try
each one and decide if I want to keep it
or pass it on I could see myself keeping
maybe one or two of the drugstore ones
and maybe one of these higher end ones
and that's enough because I certainly
don't need to keep all these unless
somehow I was absolutely in love with
all of them but so I foresee this pile
dwindling down to maybe three once I've
tried it so that is that so these are
all of the foundations I am keeping
keeping one two thirty one thirty one is
not bad I guess thirty two if you count
my backup over here so 32 that I'm
keeping now while I use all these up of
course not well I probably eventually
get rid of one of these shades as I play
with the more yeah and of course the few
I just showed you that I might be
keeping but I think 32 out of 67
I really have essentially cut my
collection in half and that even though
this is still a ridiculous amount I feel
like I can like breathe easier like okay
I know how I feel about all of these and
then there's those last few and I don't
feel quite as overwhelmed with my
collection you know I don't have five
shades of every single product I don't
you know so that is a great feeling
though these are all of the products
that I am getting rid of one two three
four five six seven eight nine put your
petite
18 19 20 - one - two - three - four -
five - six - twenty-seven so you know
not exactly half but I feel good about
like especially these high-end products
that I knew like these market Jacobs
ones I know that I don't love them but
the old me would have been like well
I'll keep all three it's like why so
I've got one to continue to try just in
case same with the Giovanni these are so
expensive so I always feel so
self-conscious about like getting rid of
them just in case but there is no just
in case I don't need them so again I'd
rather pass these on mother knew in case
someone absolutely loves them and so
other things where I just had other
shades formulas I just don't like some
of these are just old so that is a great
feeling I'm proud of myself I think that
was decently cutthroat it wasn't my best
but it certainly wasn't my worst if you
want to watch more of my declutter
videos I will link my declutter playlist
down below for this round in 2018 I've
already done highlighters and palettes
so highlight highlighters in palettes
I'll link both of those below and then
I've got years of declutter x' where
I've gotten rid of even more in the past
if you want to watch the playlist there
are tons you can kind of pick and choose
which ones you're interested in which
ones you're not so so I'm still planning
to reorganize this drawer this is
actually just like a drawer divider I
got at The Container Store but all of my
foundations fit here and I can almost
see all of them I think I want to
eventually reorganize like I said but
I've got more to declutter more drawers
to kind of free up before I can really
spread this out but I I deal II I want
to be able to see them all so I can you
know I'm not digging through the back
through three layers of foundation but
much better it's only two layers instead
of like four which is what it was which
is nice but again
eventually all reorganize but I figured
you might be interested to kind of see
what it looks like now I hope you
enjoyed and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
