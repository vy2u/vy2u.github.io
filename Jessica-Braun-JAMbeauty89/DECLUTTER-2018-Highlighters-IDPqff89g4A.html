are just going to declutter my
highlighters I have felt very
overwhelmed lately by my all of my
drawers yeah
like incredibly overwhelmed and the
problem I'm facing right now because
because I am a youtuber and I review
makeup for you know one of my jobs is
that I've got a lot of stuff in here
that I've not even tried and I always
feel so torn with the clutters because
I'm like do i declutter it and not even
try it or do I keep it but then do I
want to keep it in the drawer with all
of this stuff so that's something I'm
trying to figure out today how I want to
manage this because it really is getting
to that point where it's overwhelming
again and I do this probably once a year
sometimes even more than that so if
you're interested in my past to clutters
I've done some not actually pretty
recently I will link the playlist below
I've got years of declutter --zz I'm
usually pretty ruthless I don't know how
I'm gonna be this time around I really
don't so I'm just kind of in the mood
I've got my little Lacroix here and I'm
ready to declutter so what I usually do
is I start with products that I love and
today in my head what I said to myself
was I want to start by pulling products
that I'm proud and excited that I own do
you know what I mean so that's kind of
my thought process first first thing I
am always excited to use my Becca poured
cream in Champagne pops so I'm gonna
keep this one oh I wanted to show you
this container the cosmetic archive this
is a container they make that's
literally made for the Alex Shores I
think all of their containers art and
she is a lovely subscriber and she sent
me a couple of these and this is the one
I think I might use for this highlighter
drawer so I'm gonna put the things I'm
keeping in this and I know the
Lighting's all weird it's kind of
nighttime and I only have some of my
lighting out so hopefully you guys can
see okay so I also love this Laura
Mercier matte radiance baked powder so
much so I'm definitely going to keep
that what else oh my gosh essence pure
nude I use like four times a week it's
not ice I mean I'll use it every single
day so I'm definitely keeping that this
Tarte one in stunner I
really really liked as well and it's
newer to me so I'm still excited to own
it and use it huh this is where I always
get like so thrown okay um what else do
I feel like oh yes about oh oh no but is
a highlighter see how I was thinking
this was my blush this I do want to keep
and I want to make sure I get more use
out of this is the Dior Dior skin nude
air Luminizer so I want to get more use
out of this one so I want to keep it
this one still new to me it's the
Lancome dual finish highlighter and
sparkling pêche gorgeous the wet and
wild highlighting powder and precious
petals I get a lot of questions about
this it is a nice highlighter I just
don't ever reach for it and so I'm like
why even keep it but what I'm gonna do
this is gonna go on a maybe pile because
I have a couple other wet-and-wild
highlighters I want to show you and then
I might decide from there what I want to
do so that I'm just gonna kind of create
a little maybe oh they're this pure nude
from her natural nude from Physicians
Formula I've loved for a long time
I still use from time to time so I'm
gonna keep that same goes both of these
actually I probably could have pulled
out first-round pure afterglow is
absolutely stunning stunning highlights
such if you have more fair skin same
goes for the pixie one in London luster
so keep those the uLTA Beauty
illuminator I think I'm gonna pass on
I've already reviewed this so I don't
feel the need to keep it and it was nice
but the duo kind of not duo chrome but I
don't know it was a little bit powdery
but it the finish on it just didn't
match my skin tone very well so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that one on and
I don't know where to put it now we'll
do the pass on pile over there
the master chrome in 100 Matt gold I
just think this is too too dark for my
skin tone I mean right it's gorgeous but
way too dark so I'm gonna pass that on
actually let's make that the pass on
tile this will be the baby it's harder
for me and my pregnant belly don't
reached over there over and over again
okay speaking of like odd coloring for
me this Milani one is new to me it's
hypnotic lights in lustre light but
again it's one of those colors that I'm
just like
just not quite what I like so I'm gonna
pass that one on - all right these pop
Beauty highlighters
I feel like I don't need all four these
are pretty recently new to me they're so
like creamy though I mean they really
are kind of unbelievable this one
however has glitter glitter and it's
like white that's so pretty
this is where we all get torn with
highlighters because it's like well okay
that one's definitely too dark I can
pack that on last finger here okay that
one - gosh these are gorgeous though
how's those two on I think these two I'm
gonna put these both in the maybe all
right this one I think I'm gonna go
ahead and pass on I talked about
actually oh Jessica quite recently the
cargo HD one and it's a highlighter in
bronze but again it's little dark so I
wanted as a highlight and it is earth
sorry as like a blush almost blush
chopper I'm sorry I don't know what I'm
saying anyway I just I don't really
reach for it anymore so I think I'd
rather just pass it on to someone it
would actually use it and can be excited
about it this fancy Beauty one I'm still
trying out I think I like it will I ever
buy another one no because I just don't
think it's anything above and beyond
what's already out there you know what I
mean so I'm gonna keep it because I want
to keep trying it out but I don't think
it's a must-have for anyone to go run
out and buy its Milani one and strobe
light it's just too dark for me pass it
on
this is so hard cuz I always want to
have some of these but if they're too
dark this over one in Rodeo Drive see
it's a little bit too dark but that one
at least blends out a little bit better
so I think I will keep this over one
does it help if i zoom in a little bit
all right so I've got these two
meteorites from Gere lon mm-hmm
I never reach for these I really truly
don't think if I were to keep one I
don't even know I just don't need them
jokes could just pass them on I'm gonna
pass them on that's
hard because there's so much offensive
but I just don't ever use them alright
so I have these hello halos let me pull
a few more in and I've done a review of
these I really really liked them I don't
need all of them though so I think I'm
just gonna keep this one in halo goodbye
and just pass on all the rest they're
gorgeous
I just don't need them all
RMS beauty I love my master miss mixer
and my living Luminizer their cream
highlight so I'm definitely keeping
those two these two are just was not
impressed with either one of these I
just felt like it was like I don't know
like they weren't anything they really
weren't I push down on this so much
they're okay but they're nowhere near
anything else I've tried so I think I'm
gonna pass these on start a clever girl
it's Kevin a Quan one I just don't ever
reach for it's part of this trio thing
the NiO setting powder I just don't ever
use that I'm gonna pass it on these Ilia
ones I'm still trying out these are like
they're highlighting sticks and I do
still want to try these out cuz I've had
a lot of questions about this brand so
I'm gonna keep them but if I end up not
liking them all pass them on so it's
kind of a we'll see about you kind of a
thing these three I love my next dose of
do I love my wife L glow shot this only
one is really really nice for the
drugstore do I need it still actually I
think I might pass on these elf ones and
I'll keep the aimer one elephant is why
I sell are kind of similar so I'm
definitely gonna keep those two and I
think about these this gigi hadid
tinted or liquid strobe it's in gold
it's way too dark someone to pass that
one on this is the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter in opal I repress this because
of course it's shattered it's still so
beautiful so I'm gonna keep that one I
think I'm gonna keep both of these for
the time being so I'm working on a dupes
video and I want to keep testing those
too
this urban decay and Chris and Leanne
really pretty I don't ever reach for it
and it's still new to me and I still
don't want to reach for it so I'm just
going to pass it on
this milk makeup glitter stick I'm going
to pass on I just don't it I don't ever
use it the loop what was this the
holographic stick in Mars I did like
this do I keep it or do I just go ahead
and pass it on mmm zhenia maybe I did
like this to face highlighter it
reminded me a lot of that other one the
Becca cream one so I'm going to keep
that I really like both of these the
Marc Jacobs and the Becca shimmering
skin perfecter this cover effects stuff
I again I feel like I've only used like
once so I feel like I should use the
little more before I pass it on so I'm
gonna keep those three okay
so my two hourglass palettes I'm gonna
keep these are still new to me but I
don't think I need both but if I did a
review I'd want to be almost watch Alton
so again I'm going to keep these because
they're new with the understanding that
if I don't like them I'll pass them on
etc these two are from this new this as
well this new wet-and-wild line I think
I'm gonna keep the loose highlighting
powder because I'm intrigued by that but
these two these colors don't look up my
alley so I'm just not even gonna open
that I'm gonna pass them on the butter
highlighters I they're not bad I just
don't love them I'm just gonna pass them
on same with this color pop amber
crystal liquid highlight I didn't love
it let's see oh the master fairy
highlight no it's just not it's not my
cup of tea same goes for these two jcat
they came out with two new colors this
greenish one is mermaid skin this
orangish one is moon and back they're
brand new I'm gonna pass them on while
they're still do cuz someone will love
those these color pop highlighters
I like wisp but this has like a purple
shift to it over the moon I'm gonna pass
that one on and spoon has a lot of
glitters someone passes on and keep wisp
there's no rhyme or reason to where I'm
putting these in there I'm gonna have to
organize that alright so we have these
elf duo's I don't like any of these I'm
just gonna pass all three on I really
didn't this farce Ollie jelly beam I'm
still trying out I liked what I've tried
but again I just want to continue to
figure out how I like it
this is this butter LONDON glazing face
glow I can't remember what this was like
this is more like a price less like a
highlighter and more like a almost
primary I might hold on to that and keep
trying that alongside the farce Ollie
these chant cat beauty things are
gorgeous i think i've swatched him
before but i don't need all three like
this dark ones way too dark for me this
one's kind of borderline so I think I
might keep the light one and pass on the
kind of more champagne one so I can
still try it out some more these loonies
shimmer ista loose highlights again I'm
gonna keep the light one and pass on the
bronze one but see there I'm like well
maybe I should keep it to go along with
the other lore'l things let me think
about this one
this coverfx highlighter in sunlight I
just bought on HauteLook so it was like
50% off it looks like it's gonna be a
really like almost boring highlight but
in a way I might like but I literally
haven't even tried it on my face so
definitely gonna keep that one for the
time being alright so we've got these
cover effects glitter drops these look
so fun for someone that like likes this
kind of thing you know because they are
truly blue glitter I mean how fun is
that can you put it on your eyes like is
it I safe that's what I would be curious
about it's in the shade lunar by the way
I mean it's so gorgeous so again I might
keep it just to I want to look more into
it oh my gosh that's not coming off okay
maybe I don't want to keep I'm gonna
keep it alongside my alongside this one
but I might move this maybe to my eye
jar but I want to look it up and see if
it's I safe I'm sure you guys can't tell
me
this okay this is an this is a highlight
stick from wet-and-wild again it's
limited edition um last time super
interested in doing a whole video on a
limited edition line I don't like to
keep too much because unless I just
absolutely love it
it's something that eventually I'm not
gonna be able to talk about on my
channel you know what I mean so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that one on
these liquid glow things maybe I will
keep all of this looming line now that
I'm thinking about it this included just
to try them out like in a video so I'm
gonna go and keep those and again might
be getting rid of darker shades
eventually this is from Catrice it's
like a highlight bronze contour palette
I think I'm gonna keep it but I might
move it to do I really need it they just
said this to me
but I mean I don't know that I'm even
that interested in it the pans are so
small it's gonna drive me crazy I'm just
gonna pass it on this prismatic thing
from Kevin of Quan is kind of cool so I
want at least give it a try it just got
it in the mail I love my little girl on
little beads so I'm gonna keep that and
then I still have more don't worry guys
we've got some pallets coming these are
from Catrice that I just got strobe to
glow highlighter stick so these are
rough these are like hard to get going
well no they're not that was just that
one so there's three different tones
that one looks at my alley again I might
keep them just to try it and then we'll
see if I decide to get rid of them or
not alright I've got this milk makeup
quad I don't ever use I'm gonna pass on
cokie one again i'm just not interested
in this let me put that in the maybe
TARDIS pro glow i do like i need to use
more often than i do you like it so i'm
gonna keep that for now this strobing
glow is really nice from profusion it's
more than what i will ever need but i
think i'm going to keep it because i do
want to talk about this in a video if i
do like just a profusion video but this
is one of their really good
product so I'm gonna keep that it's
wet-and-wild highlighting palette I used
so few times that literally I did a
whole wet wild video and completely
forgot I own this didn't even mention it
it's it's fine it's okay I just don't
really care about it like that's about
the only shade I can pull off so pass
that on
keep that this is an Etsy palette that I
just have some highlighters and then a
blush in I do want to keep it because
these highlighters are nice but mostly
just for the palette I might rework it
and put shadows in this and then swap
some things around but I do want to keep
this so let's look at my babies you know
what I'm just gonna get rid of all of
them cuz I'm not gonna miss him any
there we go bye babies all of you sorry
okay so this is all that I'm keeping got
kind of my palettes over here again I
need to kind of reorganize a bit but
that is awesome and then look at all
that I'm getting rid of look at all this
this is crazy
it's amazing what just sits in my
drawers and like I said some of its new
some of it I've had a while some of them
are just shades from a range I just
don't need so I'm gonna donate what I
can
things that are unopened things like
that and then the rest I might bring in
to work and let the ladies at work go
through once I've done more to
cluttering we'll see I like to share the
love my sisters have so much makeup my
friends have so much makeup so I try to
like spread it out anything that's used
so anyway I hope that you enjoyed this I
know this wasn't super high quality like
most of my other videos are you know a
little bit better of quality but I was
gonna do this anyway tonight and I
thought you know what why don't I just
film it so you guys can at least get a
glimpse into kind of my thought process
and just some things I'm keeping and
getting rid of this time so I've got it
all organized in my Alex drawer that
actually I can't show because my palette
drawer is so full that something is
stopping hits of Tyler's probably gonna
have to remove the drawer so I can
figure it out but I just organized this
just to show you so these are all of my
like cream highlights liquid highlights
just hourglass palettes and just kind of
random and then like my regular
highlighters a few palettes and then
these are all those new things I'm
wanting to try out
and then I just have my couple pilots
back there and I think that's gonna work
I wish I could shove it but these uh
these containers really do fit like
literally like a glove that is amazing

declutter playlist watch some more I
hope you'll subscribe and I'll see you
