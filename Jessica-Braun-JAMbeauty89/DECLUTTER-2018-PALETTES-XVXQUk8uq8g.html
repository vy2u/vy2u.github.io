declutter my palettes this is like one
fifth of my palette so we're just gonna
kind of do it in little sections
I'll pull more out I literally this
palette drawer was so full I had to have
Tyler unscrew the drawer above it
because if they were sticking up too
high and I couldn't shut the drawer
above it so that's when I knew it is
time this is gonna be difficult because
I just have so many true-blue favorite
palettes and then there's also new ones
I'm trying a new favorite so this is
always a little bit tricky but let's go
ahead and get started alright this is
one of my favorite palettes the pixie
and it's Judy time palette it's so good
definitely keeping the hats I'm gonna
pass this on I used it a little bit and
it was really nice the Urban Decay and
Kristen Lee Anne but I'm not gonna use
it enough it's going to get lost in my
collection I already know it so I'm
gonna pass that one off violet Voss Holy
Grail palette is like my Holy Grail I
spilled coffee in it and it was
resurrected from the dead and I can't
believe it still works and love this
palette it's such a mess and I love so
definitely keeping that one
the Just Peachy Maps is still pretty new
to me and I'm really enjoying it the
Milani bold obsessions please I'm
obsessed with the two Milani pounds so
definitely give me that
alright so I think this is another one
I'm gonna get rid of I did like this
yeah it's such a nice traveling palette
but I don't really need it so again I'd
rather a friend or someone since I've
already used it that's actually excited
to own it own it you know what I mean
Jaclyn hill palette yes of course I'm
enjoying this I feel like I still
haven't used it enough like I've used it
a ton where I really I know I like it
but I just want to use it even more so
definitely keeping that the cielo
palette in soul the eyes are the window
to the soul
this is one that I told you I'm just not
getting a lot of use out of so I need to
use it more because it's still really
new to me but it's just one of those
palettes that I don't know I just it's
not as inspiring to me as I'd hope it
would be superhero power I've already
owned this is brand new so this
another one they sent so I'm going to
donate this one the Catrice ultimate
chrome collection this is still new and
this is not something up my alley so I'm
gonna donate that one as well the collab
one I actually really have been enjoying
so I'm gonna keep this for now
and then this makeup forever one I
recently bought I'm still trying out so
I'm gonna continue to keep that one okay
so next round sweet peach palettes one
of my faves so I'm definitely gonna keep
that one Modern Renaissance I love shade
my eye I love but again I need to get
more use out of this golden state of
mind one from colour-pop I just didn't
really care about
I just didn't it's kind of gritty for
what it is and while they can still look
really pretty I just again I'm never
reaching for it so pass the naked 3 wait
I thought I'd get rid of this Jessica or
did I not I don't remember what I
decided I thought I was getting rid of
this or maybe this was the one that I
said no I don't know and I like couldn't
get myself to get rid of it I know for
sure I'm keeping the Naked 1 palette
naked too I think I'm just gonna keep
all three let me put these in a maybe
pile
these profusion ones are pretty nice but
do I really feel like I like need need
them I haven't even opened this mochi I
was I'm gonna pay I'm gonna donate the
smokey one since its brand new the
sultry palette again was nice but these
are not necessarily colors that are at
my alley there's like maybe two or three
so I don't need to keep the whole
palette for it master palette by Mario
I'm gonna keep I ended up buying this on
eBay I I think it's legit but I have
been enjoying using this so this is
gonna go in the maybe as well persona
identity palette I have him adoring
right now so I'm definitely gonna keep
this the clover palette I have actually
quite liked I really like a couple of
these shades but again this is a palette
that I'm not using a ton of so I could
see myself I want to use it some more
but I could see myself perhaps one day
getting rid of this these jeez you have
to eat ones there alright I'm just gonna
pass on I'm not gonna I never reach for
him
now that I've reviewed them so pass this
you say one I'm gonna pass on again the
colors are just okay very uninspiring
I'm gonna pass that one on the studio
makeup on the go palettes I loved for so
long they're getting kind of older so I
think I'm gonna go ahead and pass these
on there ones I really have loved I've
talked about him a lot but I've had him
for quite a while and I think they've
kind of served their purpose
I'm sorry studio make a bond that goes
you're really good but I gotta pass you
on this wise art visi art palette I'm
definitely gonna keep I love that the
other Milani most loved matte palette I
love this stellar palette it is nice I
should use it some more I don't really
know my feelings on it and it's a newer
brand so I should use this some more
before I decide I love the regular
chocolate bar palette and the semi-sweet
I actually really liked a lot too so
Kiki this is where it gets a little
trickier this makeup geek one is
actually just a oh I did have singles in
here I might take these singles and put
them in let me show you I have these two
Z palettes so I might move these singles
to here and then pass the palette is
really nice I might think about keeping
it for travel but I mean I don't know or
see so I'm gonna put this with these to
talk about here in a minute
this semi-precious from colour-pop again
I never reach for there's nothing really
wrong with it I just don't ever use it
it's Ilia quad I haven't even tried do I
have oh I have another Ilya quad they
sent so I'm gonna at least try these
before I decide this all may one was
actually pretty good I was pretty
impressed with this one do I think it's
the most amazing pad in the world no but
I was impressed same with this
Physicians Formula
these elf ones I do like but again I'm
not reaching for much
I don't know I'm torn though because I
do like this t42 I think I'll pass on
this one and keep these but I'm gonna
move into my single sure
speaking of elf I've got the mad format
too and the original mad format I do
like both of these I'm gonna keep those
alright what a beauty desert dusk I feel
like I'm still testing out I don't love
all the glitters but I do like the
shimmer ones and the map so when I
continue to use this the Natasha did on
the same thing I don't think I will ever
buy another one cuz I don't think it's
the quality's not above products that
are half the price do you know what I'm
saying so I don't think it's worth the
money so I'm definitely gonna keep it
and keep using it but I would never buy
another one
these Milani ones are really good too I
might keep these maybe I'll pass on the
all may one you know I'll even pass on
the physicians for me just because again
they're getting lost in my collection
someone else can love them but I'll keep
these little anyone's okay so continuing
on I have these wet-and-wild palettes do
I need to keep all of them probably not
I definitely want to keep the new
comfort zone and this the rose' in the
air one that's like the modern
renaissance I think I could pass this
one on and be fine and then I look down
so I'm going to keep those three and
then I have oh this pop beauty one I
just don't need it there's again I think
have I even open it how i swatched it I
might be able to I don't know that i've
swatched this i don't know it's not
sealed so i don't know if i can donate
it or not but either way I'm gonna pass
it on the Melissa Michelle buy old set
palette is really really nice just gets
lost in my collection so I think I'm
gonna keep it she need to actually use
it
Inglot I love these four shades I picked
up I think when we were in like Ireland
so in Dublin perhaps so I'm going to
keep those and then these Marc Jacobs
ones I really like but again I
completely forgot I own them there we go
alright so back to these I'm gonna get
rid of the amber eyes from proof
fusion and I think I'm gonna keep these
two it's the collector of me I can't
help it all right so I have these like
singles here that we need to suck up
that so what I would like to do is put
these these are Sephora collection Z
palettes aren't they so pretty get all
of my singles within these and then kind
of maybe organize them from there and
then I don't really need all these so I
have like a Mac quad that all of these
can fit in for travel I have this makeup
geek one I have this boxy charm if see
one so I have a lot of options for
smaller travel things so I kind of need
to narrow it down and just leave it that
way I'm kind of leaning towards this one
because I feel like it's the most like
sturdy when it comes to travel and
there's a nice big mirror so I think I
might pass on the Matt quad that's kind
of crazy and then I might just pass on
this smaller Z palette and then I have
this other Z palette that's just a plain
black one I'm gonna pass on so you can
see I've got highlighters I got rid of
in a different declutter video but I've
getting rid of all of these palettes I
think all in all I mean that's not bad
that's certainly enough to make a dent
in how many I'm holding on to so as I'm
reorganizing this back into my Alex
Shore we'll see if there are any else
anymore that I pull out and decide you
know I'm just not gonna keep them okay
so we've got it all organized into there
I've got it so that my singles are
easier to get to cuz I feel like they
were lost in the back and I put some
pallets back in the back that I've been
using for a long time like some of those
drugs are ones that I've had for quite a
while I know how I feel about them so I
want to keep them for the time being but
I don't need to reach for them every
single day and then some palettes I
didn't want to forget to keep using I
put up here like like I said that
natasha does know know that desert does
that I'm like you know I really need to
use some a little bit more actually I
might even get the Bartlett boss under
there so larger palettes kind of in the
front which is usually the opposite of
what I do and then I put these all of
those palettes they're those Marc Jacobs
ones there so I remember to use them
same for the Ilia ones I'm trying to use
and other than that I've got like my
little travel thing up there my Inglot
and my smaller things for single shadows
and oh let me make sure I can shut the
jewelry yes so much better so so much
better if you want a sneak peek of my
highlighter drawer if you haven't seen
my highlighter declutter it doesn't look
nearly like as pretty as that but I got
rid of a lot so good feelings all around
if you enjoyed it clutters definitely
check out my decluttering playlists that
I have I will link it below and I hope
you'll subscribe for some more and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
