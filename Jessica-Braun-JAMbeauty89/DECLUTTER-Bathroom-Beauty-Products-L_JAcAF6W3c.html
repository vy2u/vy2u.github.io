realized how much crap and how many
products I had just kind of in my
bathroom and I have you know a ton of
cabinets in there and plenty of storage
but I just have so much stuff I feel
like I don't even I there's no way I
could possibly use it all but also I
feel like I don't even know what I have
or I'm not using things because other
things are in front of it you know
there's just so much stuff so I pulled
everything out into my bedroom just
because there's better light in here and
then I also have the like drawers that I
have under the sink in here as well that
we're going to go through so let's go
ahead and kind of declutter this and
maybe I'll either find new places for
things get rid of them or we'll see so
first thing I see is the baby shampoo I
use this for cleaning brushes so this is
something I would keep so I'm going to
put my keep things to the left here all
right this is something I got at IKEA
and it is just a you know thing to hold
cotton pads and there it's mint of
course for round ones but I bought
square ones because I it was just
cheaper the day I got them but um I
think I'll keep it I need to refill it
clearly I think that's something you
know why not keep it's a nice way to
hold I can grab it without having to
open a bag this holder I don't really
use I have my toothbrush that I'm
currently using so that is obviously a
keep them kind of set it up right there
but I'm not really using it for anything
so I think I might repurpose this again
and use it for my brushes again which is
what I used to do but I don't think I'm
going to use in my bathroom because
there's no purpose so I'm going to put
this actually up on my vanity here um so
okay I got how many of these do I have
to contact lens solution things one of
the dates on these because some of these
are old this one expires in June of 2014
buh-bye trash that will be my trash pile
back there um Bausch and loan sensitive
eyes this expires in October of this
year so this will be the one that I keep
and use and it's a better brand anyway
let's see this I just got and I use all
the time so this is a definite Keith
this is the moisturizer I'm currently
using just because it's summer and it
does add a little bit of a glow this
first of all this thing is falling apart
I don't really like this it works while
removing your makeup I think it was
either breaking me out or something so I
think it's just not for me
and I was keeping it to talk about but
this might just serve the purpose
because other people love it and there's
mineral oil in it which is an ingredient
that not everyone wants to have in their
skincare you know I've got plenty of
things that mineral oil so to me I mean
I try to avoid it but it's not that big
of a deal but I just I think it was
breaking me out so that was my main
thing so that is going to be a get rid
of product this just needs to move to my
I have a section of my bathroom that I
didn't pull out that I already organized
in a video that has like my travel size
thing so this just needs to move to
there so this is going to be in a
separate pile that just needs to be
reorganized alright argan oil I actually
have this split into two different
things so I could have one in my
bathroom and one in my bedroom but I
think I might just consolidate them
again and just keep it in one because
I'm not really using in the bathroom
ever so I'm going to put this up on my
vanity this is the toothpaste I'm
currently using it's the Rembrandt
deeply white I actually like it it's
feeling pretty light I think I'm almost
out of it I've been killing it but I
actually liked it originally had a weird
kind of peroxide taste to it but now I
don't really notice it as much and the
toothpaste I was using before was
breaking me out so glad for this so
that's a keeper this is actually my
prescribed if you will toothpaste
because I just have really crappy enamel
but I'm wondering if there's a date on
this this expired oh my gosh this
already expired Jessica trash I suck at
this gross alright oh that makes me
really sad I have another one but that
is scary I didn't even realize how long
I'd had that okay so I have all these 3d
white strips that I really don't find
myself using all the time but these are
not cheap so I'm gonna keep these I'm
gonna I need to just put them in a spot
where I'll see them you know
because they're not cheap and they you
know I'm not throwing those out all
right so those are keepers this came in
a a star box actually and I I just don't
think I'll ever use it so I'll put this
in the get rid of pile on up maybe I'll
put it in a giveaway um what is this is
this just lotion I'm never going to use
it I'm being real I'm never going to use
it Clarins body lifts cellulite control
I don't think I'll ever use this either
um glam glow bright mud eye treatment I
don't think I'll use this either and
really I was reading some okay if you
have a heard of the website polished
choice it basically goes through like
all kinds of skincare ingredients or
products and talks about the ingredients
and if it's like great or terrible and
these got its pretty bad like the
ingredients are just there's not them
really that really improves anything it
just has like a you'll have to read
about it but anyway so it says you know
it might look like it's actually doing
something but after a day it's not it
was just like a hairspray like
ingredient that makes your skin look
tighter on your eyes for like a day I
don't know it's interesting just look it
up you'll know what I mean because that
clearly I am NOT a know-it-all when it
comes to skincare but I just don't think
I'll ever use it alright this is a
whitening lightening whitening pen and I
got this on HauteLook and I just I have
been using I just recently got it so
this is another keeper for me I actually
have notice to change which surprised me
this is Mario Badescu silver powder I
just got so I'm keeping this this is for
like helping with like blackheads and
stuff on your nose supposedly or with
your pores so and actually it's a
palette it really is a powder but you
get some water on a cotton pad and dip
it in here and put it on your nose it's
kind of interesting so I only use it
once I'm not sure how I feel about it
all right what next this is a
self-tanning mousse that I really like
it's comparable to you know like the
whoops
the saint-tropez and things like that
it's really good and it's so much
cheaper I just don't use it that often
but when I do I want to have it because
it's the only one I have
so this is definitely a keeper I just
need to actually use it at some point
all right let's see here this is a Oh
what's the brand it's a mixture of this
cleanser what is it called oh it's the
dr. Bronner's magic soap liquid
concentrate and you have to mix you have
to you know water it down a bit so
that's what this isn't I've been
cleaning like my Beauty Blender with it
and some brushes and it's really really
nice and it comes in a huge jug on
vitacost for like really cheap so this I
just put in a travel bottle and I have
been using so that's a keeper whoops
all right the Jergens BB body is dang it
I want to keep like all of these things
this is really not my best work I'm
usually pretty good but this is really
nice the problem is since I'm wanting a
little bit of a glow I've been using
natural glow instead of everything but
this would be nice like in the fall when
I'm not worried about having any color
because it doesn't really add color but
it really does make your skin look
beautiful so I am going to keep this but
maybe I'll put it away until fall these
are all of my mary kay products that was
just recently sent there this goes
together this is the moisturizer this is
body lotion so these two go together I
think these are breaking me out and I'm
really really sad because I know some
people love these but once I started
using them I started breaking out and I
think it's just because my skin is
stupid sensitive and I hate it so I
think these I might not use I'm going to
talk about because I want to do a Mary
Kay video but I'm going to kind of put
them away because I'm not using them
because I really think they're breaking
me out this is a toning lotion I'm
trying to use but again when you kind of
stop for a day or two with this you lose
a lot of your glow so I'm like mmm I
want to try this but I'm it's hard but
I'm going to keep it for sure and try it
these are the microdermabrasion things
I've only used them once so I need to
use these a little bit more and decide
how I feel about them these are green
contacts that I bought from a Rando site
and they drive my eyes nuts you might
have seen me wearing them a few times
but they make my eyes crazy
they they're really really crappy
quality so I I don't know I might keep
them because I want to do it like
Halloween if I want to do something with
green eyes but I don't think I'm going
to keep in mind bathroom because I'm not
ever using them in their this Mary Kay
makeup remover is amazing this is my
josie maran argan cleansing oil which I
really like so those are keepers
although I don't really need both in
there at the same time just going to
keep them both for now this is also it's
a it's pure jojoba oil and I also use
this for removing makeup so it's just
another oil to add to my arsenal I'm for
me too many another body lotion that I'm
not currently using right now but that I
will not in summer so again I don't want
to get rid of it but I guess I don't
need to keep it in my bathroom right now
these are q-tips which I use all the
time but I might find a better way to
storm than just in a bag so that's one
thing to think about so looking in here
first of all it's just dirty I need to
just actually clean it before I put it
back in there but this is a little three
drawer thing I got from Target a long
time ago
I've got some floss which this is the
floss is so definitely keeping that
samples but I'm never going to use I'm
never going to use any of these I know
I'm not I might as well just get rid of
them empty contact whoops contact lens
thing this is another one of these why
do I have to abuse why hair ties
I like having hair ties in the bathroom
but I don't need this many so I'm gonna
move these back to my room maybe just
keep like one this is a random one so
maybe I'll just keep the one I put the
rest on my vanity um I want to look this
up on polish tools and see if it's a
good toner it's Arkana brand will see my
Beauty Blender solid I do use so that's
certainly a keeper and this goes with my
Mary Kay cleansing like brush that
you'll see here in a sec so I'm gonna
look this up and decide on that
if I want to keep that English empty
that out this drawer system is from Bed
Bath and Beyond and it's actually two
different ones there's the bottom one
which is deeper and then the top one my
boyfriend got them for me I really like
it and it fits under the bathroom
cabinet really well so I've got my
contacts obviously those are keepers you
don't like to move this out of the way
for now
face wipes I don't need to keep my
bathroom I should keep my vanity cuz I
actually don't really use them on my
face anymore I use them to wipe off
squatches so I'm gonna move these into
my room I don't think I'm ever gonna use
these I really don't I think I might
just get rid of my god I'm a big laughs
anyway this needs to be moved into my
bathroom or into my room with my candles
where I keep all of my unused plug in
things so that's what I'm gonna do with
that
you know better already so I have one
more of these left but I don't need the
packaging because it's taking up room so
I'm gonna throw that away this goes with
this so I'm gonna keep those together
because there's I think how many but
yeah there's like two left so I'm
definitely not getting rid of that
obviously razors and refills are not
cheap so those are keys this is the Mary
Kay cleansing things that I was telling
you about so I really really like it so
definitely keeping that another contact
solution this one doesn't expire until 7
to 15 so this is definitely keeper but
again I don't need to necessarily well I
guess I can keep it in here because it's
kind of where keeps backups back here
I've got my self tanning mitt from st.
Moritz
I should obviously keep I need something
to apply it these are the instructions
to the cleansing brush I don't think I
need them pretty sure I know so I might
just toss those this is what I use to
hold my hair back when I'm cleaning my
face my dry brush for lymphatic dry
brushing I do every single day before I
get in the shower so that is the key
these are like pieces for this thing I
might keep elsewhere they don't need to
be in the bathroom
these are bath bombs but this one's
really old so I think I'm just gonna
throw this one away
this is one that I still have left for
my Diane hockey days back when she was
sending me things so I think I'm going
to keep this and save it and use it or
at Christmastime is this more more
pieces from that and then this I'm never
going to use I got from Bath and Body
Works a long time ago and I'm never
going to use it so I'm going to take
those out those things that I'm keeping
now onto the bottom so in here it's much
taller so you can fit kind of taller
things this is a shower cap it's the
only one I have so that is worth keeping
this is a bath pillow thing that I have
never used so why keep it I think I
might toss it this I don't know I might
this - it isn't sunscreen goes bad I
know that is there a date on this
anywhere would it be no it's literally
like wiped off this is getting pretty
old
I think this it might be time for this
to go and I just ordered some more
natural sunscreen from Vitacost last
night actually this is old and I don't
want dark town that's come back when I
was in high school and I was like yeah I
totally don't need SPF
I'm never going to age and that would
mean I've had that for like seven or
eight years that's disgusting this is
this is lotion that I love but the thing
broke so I'm gonna use the one from
another one but I have another one open
right now but it's all the same it's all
sleep lotion and I love it so much so
yeah but these all are a mess I've got
lotion all over everything but so those
are worth keeping I just need to keep
going through them alright this I use to
spot clean brushes so I'm thinking maybe
I should leave it in my room not in the
bathroom but we'll see oh I was gonna
I'm trying to side this I actually got
last summer you guys think it's still
good
I think it'd have to be fine right I
mean it was only it was literally not
even a year ago I'm gonna keep this for
a little longer because I'll use it
clearly this is the next scrub that I'm
going to use and I'm almost out so this
I'm so excited I'm not going to have
backups of everything anymore this is
the next deep conditioner I'm going to
use which I'm also almost out of the one
I have now so that is exciting but I
think this is also a deep conditioner
but of course so keeping these are tan
towels which I got in my what was it the
not Influenster um the lower summer
beauty box and I'm curious to try them
so I'm going to keep it self tanning
stuff this is like my travel loofah that
I always bring with me
so definitely keeping that so I've gone
through everything now it's a matter of
reorganizing it into this stuff found a
few more things in my bathroom in
another little corner that I want to try
and organize with it I got backup cotton
squares this Epsom salt foot soap that I
really like but I can't really keep in
my shower just because the packaging so
I want to find a good place for that and
then I have two hair sprays I haven't
open that we are also in my allure
summer beauty box so I want to find a
place for those as well this I just
found is really old I think I'm gonna
throw away too and I also just found
this Palladio one I've had for awhile
and it's almost gone and I just don't
really like it I kept using it because
I'm like well maybe I'm just crazy but I
just don't like it so I'm just going to
get rid of it and then this I bought as
a replacement for like the Johnson and
Johnson version of the like Body Wash
stuff and I would use it for my face but
I just don't like this either I've used
the decent amount but I hate it so I'm
just going to stop using it these are
new skincare products from Paula's
Choice that I've done tons of research
and I'm really excited to use so these
will definitely be incorporated in where
my main section of my bathroom of the
things I use so those will definitely be
included so these are all the things
that I me they're throwing away or
getting rid of or passing on to someone
else if it's unused like some of my glam
glow things I might you might end up
seeing them either in a giveaway or find
bundling things to sell like on an
Instagram sale but otherwise they are
gone I have
organize this in a way so basically
these are all kind of backup items like
my hope oil I'm going to use once I've
run out of my cleansing oil and once
I've run out of my Mary Kay makeup
remover I'll move on to this I've got my
tan towels here my backup of that the
Arcana toner the BB body I mean all
kinds of things like that for their back
we've got the razors and the conditioner
and then my alcohol for cleaning spot
cleaning brushes and those at the bottom
I've got more backups my scrub my
conditioner the contact solution the
lotions I'm just not using right now my
target one the after Sun one in the st.
Moritz fake tanning stuff and then the
Epsom salt the baby shampoo and then
like my other like various little things
in my mitt is there on the side so it's
nice and I know everything in there now
I know what's all in there it's that's
kind of the beauties is where I've got
it in my bathroom you can see it in
action there and let's go ahead and move
up and you can see how I reorganize the
main area of my bathroom this is the
main area it's kind of like a two-two
door little thing right here right next
to my sink and so here I've got just my
everyday most used things so I've got my
silver powder the little brush cleanser
my two new my nighttime moisturizer in
my cleanser because I would use
obviously those together my cleansing
oil to get my makeup off my natural glow
my toothbrush my toothpaste floss and
then in here I've got my whitening
products and then the brush heads for my
cleanser my few extra things in my solid
cleanser this is where I decided to put
my q-tips that worked well got my little
thing to hold my hair back my dry brush
the cotton rounds and then the cleanser
thing so that's all that is in there so
then in this section which is next to my
shower this bottom part opens and this
is where I keep all this stuff you
really didn't see because I've already
organised this so behind this is my next
shampoo and conditioner I'm using whoops
but in these little bins I've got travel
shampoo and conditioner travel lotions
and hair spray and then travel body
products and then this is just a spray
for the bathroom and then I also have
this is the doctor
Bronner's castile soap I told you guys
about that's really cheap on vitacost
for this huge thing and then you water
it down you use it for everything and
it's like not bad for you or anything
and then I've got tampons I've got
toothpaste here and an extra toothbrush
and things like that so that has kind of
already been organized by me in the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
