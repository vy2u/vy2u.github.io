bronzers holy cannoli
I don't have as many bronzers as I do
like others things however this is still
ridiculous
I would like to keep like four we're
gonna see how I do might be more than
four and you know some things I keep
something oh I'm planning a review on
this whatever but trying to be really
good about just know Jessica get rid of
it so I can get rid of this pure one I
really liked it but frankly I don't even
know that they sell this anymore and
it's pretty old so that one can go this
Marc Jacobs one is really old I've had
forever twelve months that's funny I've
probably had it for three years it can
go this guy's face FX I really really
enjoy so I'm gonna keep this this hula
quickie contra stick I am very surprised
to say that I love this it's really
quick to blend out so I'm keeping that
that I thought I would totally hate and
I ended up loving it these elf ones can
go this okay where this is where it gets
a little trickier this Smashbox contour
kit I never ever reach for and I've kept
because I know so many people love it I
don't reach for it
someone else can love it this Catrice
sun lover the more I've used the less
I've liked I felt like it was a little
splotchy because when I first showed it
I think it was like a first impression
I'd maybe tried it once more I've tried
it I don't really like it it can go
butter bronzer it's old and broken it
can go it's to face one I do like the
Physicians Formula I do not but the Too
Faced one I liked it but frankly I like
like these kind of cream rozzers better
so I'm gonna pass this on this Chanel
one I freaking love so I'm going to keep
it what's the date 18 months we're
probably getting close but I'm gonna
keep it it's our three favorites the
sculpting glow is really really good too
let me put this in a maybe do I really
need this and the D the Chanel one
probably not so that's a maybe this is
getting pretty old but I totally
recommend it the bronze booster or
contour is really nice
this models own one can go it's a crazy
color
it can just go its way wrong for my skin
tone I never reach for the bottom
deserts I never reach for any of these
these can all go I don't reach for any
of them this NARS one is still newer to
me and I do like it so I'm gonna keep
that one
it's tantalizer I never use the ultimate
I don't use like any of these it's crazy
this is what I do use from time to time
I actually like this one it's a little
orange see but that I don't know I'm
gonna pass that on the bronze goddess I
recently got I have the brush for but I
don't ever use so the brush can go I
feel like I just haven't used enough to
even know like how I feel about it
so I feel like I should keep it and like
actually try it out you know this
tomforde one's really new to me so I'm
still trying that out all right so the
number seven I don't need all three let
me narrow this down got golden sands
which I was my original one I loved
what's this one caramel and maple I'm
gonna keep maple I feel like that's a
nice shade for me they're all pretty
close and I'm just gonna pass on the
other two I'm gonna pass on this whole
Kevin Taquan book someone will love this
and I'm never reaching for it the pixie
one I never reach for but it is nice the
profusion one I never reach for poops
I'm putting these in the wrong pile
these can go alright so what we're left
with these two are good but I'm gonna
pass them on I never reach for them
hoola it's not bad I just that's a maybe
I just don't ever reach for the
chocolate Soleil I do like that let me
think about those too so I have two
hourglass ones this one is diffused
bronze bronze light and this one is
luminous bronze light okay it's a little
more cool tone and that's warm so I
think if I'm gonna keep one it's gonna
be this one not the luminous so the
luminous can go this one can stay I'm
just gonna pass these two on I don't
need them and again I was keeping them
because they're cult classics but why
I don't even use them and then I have
the two Kevin of Kwan ones I've got the
one in light the sculpting powders that
is and the one in medium honestly the
light one is so slightly different that
I feel like I'm just gonna keep the
medium and pass on the light because I
don't feel like there's not enough of a
difference and I think the medium still
looks nicer on my skin so I'm gonna keep
the medium and the sculpting glow I'm
just gonna pass on because I'm not gonna
get through both of these honestly and
I'd rather finish one you know what I
mean so I'll pass that one on - is
everything I'm passing on here oh my
gosh a ton compared to what I'm keeping
which is just those things so that is a
good feeling
obviously my favorite drugstore bronzer
is the number 7 one it is so good and
you know some of it will go in the
garbage this really is pretty old and
broken so like that'll go in the trash
but a lot of it will get donated or
passed on and it's a good feeling and
I'm proud of myself because again I got
rid of some high-end ones that I've been
holding on to for so long but again for
no reason I wasn't using them so I'm
excited to just have products they
genuinely use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
