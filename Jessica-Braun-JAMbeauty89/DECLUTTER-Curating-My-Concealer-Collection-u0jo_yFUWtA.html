concealers some concealing powders some
skincare it's just a mixture
I can't even shut this drawer that this
is in because it's so full that's
ridiculous so I'm gonna be very
cutthroat and as I have been and get rid
of most of it and keep only what I'm
genuinely using if there are some things
that I feel like you know what I haven't
tried long enough to decide then I do
have a separate little drawer in my
closet where I'm gonna keep products
that I just need more time with but
they're not necessarily a part of my
curated collection yet does that make
sense and then if I try and decide I
don't like it you can go so let's I'm
gonna sit I'm gonna start with the
concealers I'm going to spread them out
so they're easier to see
Bobby Brown this is one of my favorite
correctors of all time it's gotten lost
in my thing it's one of my favorite so
I'm definitely keeping that joke a
beauty I didn't like back I didn't like
the pixie I didn't like Milania didn't
like glossy I didn't like even the
benefit I didn't really like so I'm
gonna pass all of us on and the benefit
ones pretty new but it was just
unimpressive I was so sad because I it
was supposed to be like the array space
and it's totally not so all of those are
finally gonna go this by by under is
actually pretty good let me think about
this I'm gonna put this right over there
it's NARS one I have grown to love for
actually priming my eyes but I'll use
this sometimes on my like facial skin
too so I'm definitely keeping that I
didn't like this ELF powder this
bareMinerals one is really old so that
needs to go Besame one is old I like
these two under-eye powders but now I've
learned that the Charlotte Tilbury is
leave it's the best thing I've ever used
so my under-eye like ever ever ever I'm
gonna finally get rid of my next one
this is all I'm gonna keep the powder
the Laura Mercier one's pretty good too
so I'm gonna keep this this Mac I
actually do use this on my face to
conceal blemishes I'm gonna get the Mac
one too
this does not work very well at
concealing blemishes so I'm gonna pass a
hot even though it's called bye-bye
breakout arraign these three can go
I just don't reach for in the covergirl
stellar and Maybelline master camo
what else okay what are some of my
favorites I love this mac prolongwear I
just repurchased it I hadn't had it in a
long time so I'm definitely keeping that
this milk makeup flex concealer is new
to me and I cannot put it down so I'm
definitely keeping that it doesn't make
my skin look old and creepy it's really
nice the Ulta full-coverage liquid
concealer I adore I use all the time mmm
what are okay some of these are newer to
me like this Catrice camouflage I've
been enjoying a lot and it's newer to me
so you definitely keeping that this is
crazy
oh the NARS one I recently repurchased
and I'm enjoying more than I used to I
think it looks a little more natural and
I'm growing to like that more I don't
mind a little bit of imperfection
showing through my under-eye if it looks
a little more natural to you know what I
mean especially in real life I'm a
teacher I'm close to people a lot and I
don't know so I've actually been
enjoying this more than things - did I
say that enough my goodness Jessica you
said it ten times alright these it
cosmetics perfect lighting things I just
don't ever reach for so those can go
this Revlon one was okay but I don't
really care this wet want one is old
that one needs to go let's see oh this
infallible one is way too dark
NYX gotcha Covered is fantastic but I
never need that much coverage and this
looks a little darker I feel like it's
changing color a bit I love this
bourgeois radiance reveal corrector or
concealer you can't get it in the States
as far as I know I bought it when I was
in Dublin maybe I love this stuff so
much that's something I grab when I
don't even want have to think about I
just throw it on I have two of these
wipes I'll chew shikaku I really need
both I like them but I don't need both
I'm not gonna use both so I'm gonna keep
this one and passes in they're the same
shade don't ask how I got to I really
don't know I don't think I bought too
but you know what who knows alright
there's Kevin of Kwan born this way
sorry the Kevin of Kwan and the Born
This Way
I just don't reach for those can go
another Kevin of Kwan this Catrice
brightening concealer oh yeah it was
that kind of pink and I'm like no I'm
good good my under eye already looks
crazy enough I don't need to emphasize
its craziness oh I really like this
Clinique beyond perfecting it's really
high coverage but it is more lightweight
and that's why I've been reaching for it
a lot more lately let's see I never use
this real deal I wanted it so badly I
finally bought it and I never use it and
frankly
a little bit too orange for me this
Neutrogena one I have not even tried
it's like a moisturizing one for your
face oh yeah I have like used it once or
twice so I shouldn't say I've never
tried but then I it just got buried so
I'm gonna keep that one yeah it's Kat
Von D 1 and this Urban Decay one they're
just drying I can't get over it and that
the Tarte shaped tip is drying too but
not quite as much so so I'm gonna pass
these on I might I under eyes can't
handle it this is a 401 and this
revolution one are still pretty new to
me so I feel I'm gonna put these over
here I want to think about those along
with that a cosmetics one the all hours
concealer I feel like I've barely tried
as well I'm gonna keep Tarte shade tape
because I'd like to use it up do I think
will repurchase it not really it's I
don't think it's bad I've said it I've
explained it too much on my channel
probably but it's just not my favorite I
know a lot of people love it but I do
want to use it the retouching erase is
pretty old
this pixie one just what didn't impress
me that can go smack stick concealer
it's like exactly the same as the other
one this one might be a little bit more
moisturizing I feel like I should keep
both and try them this onna me bright
concealing a lick sir I've barely used
it's so dirty though is it just a
concealer oh so I want to try that I
really like this brand so I definitely
want to give that a try and then this is
this osmotics concealer and so much more
oh my that might be a little too orange
so pass that one on all right I'm gonna
pass on the it cosmetics one the
revolution one I just remember really
liking everyone thought maybe it's a
dupe for Tarte shape tape but it just
kind of made my under eyes look a little
dry and old I'm just gonna pass it on
the Sephora bright future gel serum
again I haven't really tried a ton oh
but I feel like I'm gonna like it so
again I want to try that and then this
YSL all ours okay I think that's too
yellow don't you so I'm gonna pass that
one on
now into some skincare let me set this
stuff out it's not all my skincare I
have drawers and drawers of this of
skincare unopen in my closet that's the
declutter for another day but these are
ones that I have opened and tried so I
kind of keep them together just to kind
of be able to use when I'm getting ready
so these aren't necessarily ones I use
at night these are more ones I use
before putting on makeup all right so
let's see I really really like this
moisturizer this serum the dropper is
broken and driving me crazy it's gonna
go out of these three my favorites the
Physicians Formula so the other two can
go
this beauty shield stuff I love but I
think it's gotten a little bit old it's
almost gone anyway so I'm gonna toss it
the caffeine solution this says twelve
months and I've had it for a year and a
half it needs to go in the trash same
goes for this ordinary this natural
moisturizer I've had this for longer
than a year it needs to go in the trash
this original skin matte moisturizer I
do really like this serum is gorgeous I
love it
this zit zapper this i refresh I'll keep
those I do like those I've got some eye
drops why do I have three well that's
alright I'll keep all three toes this
eye cream I just moved on I felt like it
started to turn like it's smelling weird
and so I did really really really liked
this eye cream but I don't know like
does it have a date no it doesn't oh yes
it does six months well that would be
why I've definitely been using this
longer than it just smells a little off
and I'm like I don't think I want to put
this right next to my eye anymore but I
really enjoyed that stuff this bright
booster royal elixir I've already gone
through my primers and I kept a few oils
so I'm gonna pass this along it's really
nice though it's really really nice I
just can't go through them all before
they go bad alright so these this eye
treatment serum from onna me I'm going
to keep this wonder glow from Charlotte
Tilbury I'm not going to use I know
myself
the original skin matte moisturizer I
really really like so I'm going to keep
that and then Charlotte's magic cream
I'm gonna hold on to as well cuz I want
to actually say this is everything I'm
keeping I just have my concealers here
these were like heaping above before
I've made two under-eye powders buy more
potted concealers and then a couple of
skincare products and then this is
everything I'm getting rid of so some
stuff that's gonna go in the trash I'll
sort through it some of it I'm just
gonna pass on to sisters some of it fits
able to be I can donate it so that's a
good feeling just all of this was
clogging up my drawers and so many of it
again
I was keeping because it's a name-brand
and I'm like oh well you know maybe I'll
make it work well no and like this is so
new to me but it's it's terrible so
anyway that is this declutter if you
want to watch more of them definitely
stay tuned subscribe hit that
notification bell otherwise I'll link my
declutter playlist so you can see some
more because I've gotten rid of a lot
and saw my other videos and this was
still a lot - but it was just less to go
through compared to like my lip products
and things like that where I got rid of
like 90% of it so I hope you'll catch
those and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
