shadows eye primers by glitter pigment
etc cream shadows everything's kind of
all-in-one I've got some more over here
I'm gonna be pretty cutthroat I'd like
this all to fit and like two of these if
not less this is gonna be difficult I
know that I can do it though let's just
go ahead and get into it so let's start
over here this NYX white eye primer
there we go
NYX eyeshadow base and white is amazing
for like glitter or shimmer that you
really want to pop I use it all the time
it's really really emollient but it
works really well for that's really
sticky and then another favorite of mine
is the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot keeping
and the Paint Pot in Indian wood those
were there because I use them all the
time the Mac pigment in tan I literally
used today on my eyes so definitely
keeping and I also love vanilla so those
are gonna stay now on to the harder
parts so I have these cover effects kind
of glitter things these are really
really pretty I know that I love the one
in celestial it's a really pretty kind
of creamy white and I just Pat it onto
the lid when I wear it and then what's
the other shade I really like is this
sit this is oh maybe it was magic that I
like that's more of a pinky tone I know
this purplish one I know I can get rid
of and then this one's a little more
bronze e is called moonstone I probably
won't wear moonstone as much so that one
can go do I really need both they're
both so pretty I think I might keep oh
these are newer to me so I don't feel
too bad keeping them this cela
one and jezebel is newer to me as well
and I really I mean oh my gosh it's
unbelievable so definitely keeping that
- these are exciting still you know what
I mean and so I want to return this tiny
seal one I'm gonna pass on these color
pop ones were just okay if there was one
I really liked though these are their
supernova shadows it was either this one
or this red one this one's Walk of Fame
see these are so much chunkier than the
beautiful Sela one so it's like
hmm you know maybe was this red one this
is in firecracker
there was one that maybe that might have
been it what's this one I'm doing press
let's not really care about any of these
I don't think I need to keep any of them
those can go this wet-and-wild liquid
cap suit one I actually just used and I
get ready with me kind of a thing it's
very similar to that coverfx one
actually it's very very similar but it's
limited edition I really liked it I
don't need both so I'm gonna pass this
on it is really good though so if you're
interested I wouldn't turn my nose up at
it cuz it is actually really nice I've
got all of these little pencil type
things and I never reach for any of them
my NYX jumbo eye pencil and white I
don't use cuz I use this NYX one now and
the rest of them I never use I'm gonna
pass them all on whoo
this one I'd been trying out but it
doesn't pack as much of a punch as I'd
wanted it's this Laura Mercier caviar
eye stick and rose gold it just doesn't
do much so I'm gonna pass it on these
milk makeup things have seen better days
this have a date on it had these for a
little while it does not I feel like I
don't reach for these as much now that I
have these ones with the DOE foot
they're just so much easier to apply you
know what I mean I'm gonna get rid of
this darker one after party these are
all so pretty
I think I'm just gonna keep after party
and pass on the other two I don't think
I need all of them this elf one is
really dried up that can go is purple
one I'm never gonna use these glaze and
I glosses really are amazing but my
favorite is icing so I'm gonna pass on
the moonshine one this maersk
thing is gorgeous but I never use it so
go this one called single shadow and
brulee I swear to you I only opened like
a month or two ago and it's already that
far gone it is an amazing single shadow
I use it every day to just blend
everything together so looking
my Primus here it's gonna pick out a few
favorites and get rid of the rest
because I just don't need them I really
like these two the Smashbox and the NARS
this Smashbox one is more white than
ours is kind of more translucent but I
really like both the ultimate eye primer
is also a favorite I really like this
Catrice prime and fine brightening one
and then I think have these the shadow
insurance is pretty old and the urban
decay I'm gonna keep the shadow
insurance is pretty old it can go and
the rest of these honestly I just didn't
really care about these Physicians
Formula ones were terrible oh the
glitter primer I do think I'm gonna keep
that's a newer addition to my collection
this Milani one super old the flower one
was actually decent but I don't feel
like I need it
covergirl one was just okay pretty
vulgar was actually that was pretty good
I don't need that many of those so I
think I'm gonna keep it or sorry get rid
of it and pass on the Physicians Formula
one soon all of these color pop ones
I've had for this long and I have not
felt the need to open so those are all
gonna go I don't deserve to keep them
now these color pop ones are open and I
do want to keep a couple because these
are so quick and easy to throw on the
lid birthday cake is so pretty oh my
gosh look at that so I'm definitely
keeping birthday cake this one in
birthday girl is also pretty it's a
little bit more golden tone instead of
pink I love both of those this one in R
it's so pretty these are just so
stunning I think I can get rid of those
those this one in heinie is really
pretty too that purple one can go this
matte one I actually really did like so
I'm gonna keep that for now and try to
use it some more and then this golden
one is in fluffy maybe
- golden it looks little dried out so
past oh no alright flipping her around
here this Sarina Tarantino thing I've
had for so long twelve months I've
probably had it for five years I'm not
maybe even six I've had it for far too
long it's gorgeous but it's time I don't
even think that brand says that brand
even around anymore he's infallible
metallic paints are gorgeous let me
think about those I have the L'Oreal
infallible one it's the same as the Mac
one and I've already talked about in
dupes I don't need both and if they're
gonna go bad I might as well keep the
one I spent more money on that's kind of
my logic if they're the same these are
also old I'm gonna play about the
Smashbox woman these L'Oreal singles
were actually really nice do I really
need them oh this NARS duo and it's old
I really like these this is crazy
alright this black panther this black
this matte black and panther I'm gonna
keep cuz it'd be great for traveling the
rest of the colors I don't think I
really need to keep I might hold on to
nutty and see if I can get some use out
of that cuz it's a really pretty color
and it looks really pretty all over the
lid then blended so I'm gonna keep that
these colors were nice I think this was
one of my favorites just to put all over
the lid was this one that one's more
yellow I keep those too and pass those
on out of these I didn't pass them all
and these are really really nice but I
don't find myself reaching for them and
then this Maybelline single shadow is
gorgeous I'm gonna keep that's not bad
that's all I'm keeping oh my gosh and I
do have by the way other ones these I've
got up on my vanity I'm definitely
keeping I guess I can put them with it
these I really like these Maybelline
single shadows so I'm keeping all of
those and you know what with that in
mind maybe I don't need to keep these
L'Oreal ones I'm gonna pass the law real
ones on they're a little older anyway
everything
being it looks like a lot more cuz I
just kind of spread everything out you
know so I can actually see it what a
concept I can see all of the colors and
then this is all I'm getting rid of that
is a great feeling I'm certainly keeping
a lot less I love that I can actually
see what I have and yeah I feel pretty
good about this if you liked it clutters
like this definitely check out my other
ones where I've been just as cutthroat
if not more
some of them I've gotten rid of like 90%
of my collection it's crazy but it's a
great feeling so definitely check those
