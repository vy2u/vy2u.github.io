had a realization that I have already
decluttered these pallets semi recently
and I wasn't satisfied with what I'd
gotten rid of and I realized like for
example this is a new palette of mine I
love this palette and I thought to
myself I should feel the way about I
feel about this palette about all the
ones I own and if I don't then I should
pass them on to someone that will feel
that way about the palette because I've
already spent the money that's the
reality some of this was PR some of it I
bought you know obviously this is a job
of mine but I really should feel that
excited like I feel about this so that
is kind of my mentality going into this
if I end up with five pallets at the end
so be it and so this is one that I'm
keeping obviously it's my inspiration
for this I I know so many people feel
that this palette is boring but to me
I'm like you know what it's right up my
alley though it's exactly what I love so
that's my inspiration I'm definitely
keeping this so here we go I'm going to
get rid of this it was ok I did it I
used it in a video I liked it but I
wasn't super impressed the clover
palette I like a couple shades in but
again I'm never reaching for the I don't
even like this there's nothing even in
this that can go these wet and wild ones
I do like but I don't ever reach for
because I have other ones I like better
you know what I mean so there's nothing
wrong with these but I'm gonna pass them
on same goes for the elf like I like
these there's nothing wrong with them
but I don't reach for them because I
like other palettes better I feel like I
have another one in here somewhere so
I'm gonna pass this on the naked Heat
I'm really enjoying a lot same these
were actually in my everyday makeup
drawer same with this oh no it's this
one is yeah this Marc Jacobs one I love
both of these so I'm gonna keep these I
adore them this one I do like but I
don't feel like I like it as much as the
other one so I think I'm gonna pass it
on the back top pallets pretty new to me
let me think about this one
these two no these three I literally No
these four I literally just got so I'm
gonna put these on my vanity to try some
more because I don't want to like get
rid of them or keep them so they
basically are not a part of my curated
collection until I decide they are so
they'll just sit on top of my Vani until
I try them long enough to know how I
feel
this was terrible this tart make magic
happen palette that can go gladly
this will listen Michelle I really do
like but again I don't reach for it as
much as I had hoped I would so I'm gonna
pass that on this master palette by
Mario I bought on eBay I was all excited
but I never use it that's gonna go this
Martin mega forever I recently got I
never reach for it it's gonna go I'm on
a freaking rampage oh geez
oh these two can go the marvelous malls
from dose of colors I just didn't end up
liking it can go stellar one I never
reach for these two Ilia ones I never
reach for these Milani ones now that I
have my new obsession these two the most
loved mattes and the bold obsessions
then these can go I don't even need them
the other ones are even better so I am
keeping these lovely the persona palette
you guys know is one of my favorites the
identity palette I freaking love this
shimmers and the mats are gorgeous
here's the other elf one I'm gonna pass
on the okay this viola boss when I
absolutely love it has taken up quite a
beatin beating but I really do love this
so I'm definitely keeping that this
collab one is nice but I don't need it
that's just peachy mattes I really like
but you know what I'm never reaching for
it I really don't I have plenty of these
colors let me this is gonna be a maybe
modern Renaissance
I'm torn because I do like it but when I
compare it to my soft gallium and how
much I love this I feel like I don't
really need the modern Renaissance
you know what I mean let me this is
gonna be a maybe as well we're gonna see
what I'm keeping at the end and if I
even need those colors you know the
Jacqueline Hill palette I never reach
for but I
to reach for it more so I'm gonna keep
it but get rid of more stuff so I can
actually like see it and use it I'm
gonna get rid of the Naked 2 &amp;amp; 3 I never
use them I'm very proud of myself I'm
gonna get rid of them I really really
never use them so those can go my naked
one I do so use this from time to time
so I'm still gonna keep the one the
other two I'm very glad to get rid of
them proud of myself the semi-sweet
chocolate I really do like but I don't
reach for it very much the regular
chocolate bar I do like that one the
peach I also really like see this is one
reason why I'm thinking like do I really
need the Just Peachy
if I'm keeping this because I love a lot
of like luscious I've almost hit pan on
I love nectar and peaches and cream but
you know what the more I look at this I
feel like I use like those but I hardly
use any of these so do I really need the
whole palette because like with this one
I feel like I actually use a lot like I
use those I use those mats I've used
that I'll use that so I use more in this
palette than I do in this so oh my gosh
am I really gonna get rid of the sweet
peach I think I am so maybe I will keep
this let me think all right Huda beauty
I don't ever use it I don't ever use it
it makes me so sad let me think about
this one too I just recently got a same
at the Natasha - Nonna I feel like if I
have less palettes I will use this so
this one I'm definitely gonna keep
because I mean I've literally used it
probably four times and I don't feel
right getting rid of it just yet
the its Judi time palette I love but I
don't reach for it because I have so
many palettes so I'm gonna pass it on
the shade and light such a good mattes
palette but really do I need both of
these no and honestly out of the two I
think I'll use the visor the v's art one
more so I'm gonna keep the veto art pass
on Kat Von D I cannot believe this the
Stila one I'm never ever reaching for
I'm just gonna pass on these single
shadows I want to be able to use so I
think I'm gonna
keep my single shadows but I you know
with the hopes that I'll actually you
know use them these Inglot ones I got
they're kind of sentimental to me I got
on a trip and I do use when I travel so
I'm keeping these I am gonna keep my
chocolate bar palette here's the thing
all of these are similar I think out of
these four I should keep one I don't
think I need all of them and frankly out
of the four I think I do like the modern
renaissance better the hood of beauty
ones just it's just not up my alley I
should have known that one I bought it
and this one is nice but I mean there's
a lot of repeats and I just don't need
it
and then the backtalk one honestly I
might keep to talk about I'm gonna put
it on my vanity to talk about because I
want to do like a new palates kind of
review but then I'll probably pass it on
I don't love it so I'm gonna keep my
modern renaissance this is everything
I'm getting rid of I'm getting rid of
some naked palettes a bunch of Too Faced
palettes the Kat Von D hoodie beauty I
feel really good about this cuz I felt
guilty holding on to these when I know I
don't use them so as I look out on this
I'm trying to see if there's anything
that like when I see it I feel like no
Jessica you really shouldn't keep it but
I don't know that I feel that I feel
really good about what's left this is
manageable I can use it I still think
it's almost too much but I genuinely
really like these palettes so I don't
feel too much pressure to keep them you
know or to get rid of them that is so if
you enjoy this kind of declutter
definitely subscribe to stay tuned for
more i'll list my declutter clay list

more if you're in a mood and other than
