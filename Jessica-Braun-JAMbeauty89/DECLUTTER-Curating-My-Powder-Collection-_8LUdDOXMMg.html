powders I have been pretty cutthroat in
all my declutter this so far I'm
struggling I've been talking so much
because I've been filming all night I
really would like to get this down to
like two loose powders and two to three
real powders and that's it I know that's
crazy considering how many I have but I
just this is so much I don't need this
much so let's do this first thing I can
get rid of this bareMinerals it's not
the right shade these two I haven't even
opened so do I really need them no they
can go these two Jiwon she ones are nice
do I ever use them no they're gonna go
peach perfect I do like velvet I tzer's
okay see that's how I feel like all of
these are just okay so I feel like
because of that because I don't feel
strongly one way or the other with any
of these they could all go this okay
well this is one of my favorites this is
a repurchase and I'm already about
halfway through this one my favorite
powder foundation of all time the it
cosmetics one definitely keeping so I've
got my first thing to keep yeah um let's
see this coverfx one I do like this
Lancome one's a little bit
is this the one that's like actually my
skin tone let me see it's their
translucent powder yeah it's a little
dark for me oh well not really when you
blend it whoa it's got crazy coverage
okay holy crap this stuff is so silky
and if you can get one that kinda
matches your skin so this is 100
translucent but it does I feel like it
does have a little bit of a color this
is so nice it actually covers some
imperfections too so I'm keeping this
one the NARS one I've kept this crystal
powder forever and I never use it it can
go
the stellar one can go coverfx I'm
thinking about kind of thinking it might
be able to go and frankly I've had this
quite a while I think it's just time
one's empty
alright okay let's do this
wet and wild one I can go bare mineral I
don't really reach for any of these like
I literally don't and they're good like
the stay matte is really good don't
reach for it never reach for these this
needs to go in the trash this is so old
where to begin
peach blur this one actually I forgot
that I liked and I forgot about so I
think I actually I'm gonna keep that one
and actually use it what a concept this
okay here's where I'm struggling because
I just recently put the dim light
ambient lighting powder all over my face
and it actually darkened my skin and it
did not look good so I'm gonna finally
pass this on I really like it but I
think it's formula that's changing
because I've had it for Oh quite a while
and this is 12 months it's definitely
older than that so this is kind of my
replacement for that this is the Laura
Mercier candle glow powder in the shade
number one so we're gonna try that one
in its place this covergirl one I do
like but it's too dark for me
I've raved about it because I think the
formula is great but they just have a
terrible shade range I've got two of
these powder foundation to have this NYX
one and this Ulta one honestly these are
good but I still like this it one better
let me think about them because I also
have these positions formula ones that I
do really like well an easy one to get
rid of while I'm thinking about is this
Catrice one I don't really like this
essence brighten up one made my under
eyes look so almost it's gotta go oh it
was comically bad okay this pot beauty
setting one I wasn't really impressed
with that can go this is a loose powder
that I think is really nice it's this
Mustafa brand silky cotton loose powder
it's beautiful
like really beautiful so I think it's
expensive though but I'm gonna keep it I
think I'm gonna get rid of my
illuminating Physicians Formula one in
favor of this matte one from physicians
format I just I think I like it better
and then I'm just gonna pass these on
so this covergirl one it's getting the
creepy bumps on it they gross me out so
I think it's just time to go it's a
great powder though one of my favorite
the drugstore so some of these I haven't
even tried
I think the banana one from Milani I'm
gonna pass on just shade wise I don't
think it'll be a good fit this fit me
when I'm still trying out I'm gonna put
on my vanity because I'm not sure if I'm
gonna keep it or not depending on how
much I like it this by Terry hyaluronic
powder Hydra powder again I'm still
trying out but I do really like it so
far this Laura Mercier powder is old
it's just time it just is I've had
probably two or three of these over the
years but I just kind of noticed it's
not quite smelling like itself and it's
been what's the months on this twelve
months I probably had this particular
one a year and a half so it's just time
this is new to me I'm still I have
honestly at the time I'm filming this I
haven't tried it out now by the time
you're seeing this I might have turned
it out because this is prerecorded but
so I'm gonna keep this and same with
this Milani I haven't even tried it so
I'm gonna put them all on my vanity and
then this Caroline one I think I'm just
gonna pass on I keep it's pretty but not
pretty enough to keep that's all I'm
keeping that's all I'm getting rid of
this is crazy like I'm constantly amazed
at how much just sits in my drawer I
don't use and again some of these are
ones I actually really love but you know
if I'm not using them they're getting
old and then I have to get rid of them
anyway so for most of these I'd rather
get rid of them now while someone can
enjoy them then later like this where I
feel like I should just toss it you know
because it is older so I'll sort through
those I'm pretty proud of that and of
course there are those three that I'm
keeping to try out that I'm keeping on
my vanity to decide if I want to keep
them with these in my collection but I'm
feeling pretty good about that
so another successful declutter if you
like these definitely check out my
playlist I have I've got lots of these
where I get rid of just as much and so I
will link that below definitely
subscribe to catch more and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
