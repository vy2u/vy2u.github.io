is from the cosmetic archive she sent
these to me and I freaking think these
are cool as heck they're expensive but
they're really nice so I figured it was
worth mentioning cuz I know you guys are
gonna ask no not sponsor or anything
like that so I'm in a declutter a bunch
of blushes here I'm I would love to use
this for blush bronzer an highlight I
just did my bronzer to clutter I don't
know what water I'm putting these up but
I ended up keeping like eight bronzers
and getting rid of the rest so that's
totally plausible that I could use this
for all three for a blush bronzer
highlights we'll see I do love blush I
mean I love all of this but I just got
too much and I do I find myself varying
what I use but I'm realizing that really
I'm varying but I'm using the same color
so it's like what why even I don't know
I would love to one day be able to get
through one whole blush I know that
sounds ridiculous to some of you but oh
alright let's start over here I'm gonna
get rid of all of them I have not
reached for any of these some of them
ever the cloud paint is okay but it's
more work than I care to do they can all
go good job Jess this pixie and Chloe
Morello palette is really beautiful
I like the blushes a lot that's why I
put this in my blush store because I
figure I'll use it more there but I have
these shades in my collection I just
don't need this but it is absolutely
gorgeous but I know someone else will
love this same for this someone else
will love this I never reach for it but
it's really really nice
I just don't reach for this I do really
like it but I don't grab it same goes
for these all of these color pop ones
can go I don't like their blushes I
don't like using this formula so those
can go to someone they can be donated
these two I'm they're just too bright
they're these like what are they
Lancome macaron ones that are kind of
creamy
I'm just not using them someone else
will love them alright what else oh my
gosh okay
some of my favorite blushes I love dim
light it's so beautiful really I love
both of these so I'm probably
keep those two I'm still loving my tart
blush in risque so I'm probably gonna
keep all three of those hmm
I've got a lot of favorite formulas and
that's where I run into trouble because
I'm like well I love all of these
I do love my Dallas powder probably one
of my top few favorite blushes of all
time
so definitely keeping that I'm gonna
pass on this pixie one it's just too
shimmery same with the quo one it's
beautiful but I just don't reach for it
this is too pinkish like bluish pink for
me so that one can go it's a great
formula though I don't ever reach for
these Bobby Brown ones there's nothing
wrong with them they're beautiful
I just don't grab them so I'd rather
someone else love them this elf one I
bought again it's candid coral and I
really like this shade or no that's
called sorry
mellow mauve it's just no this is what's
mellow mauve is really really pretty I'm
gonna hold on to that one
same with Bom Beach I love this color
the UH again color pop I don't like this
butter highlight thing I don't really
reach for this Too Faced one those can
go it's number seven one's just a little
too dark
stellar one's a little too glittery um
Smashbox trio I just don't gravitate
towards it's really really nice though
this one was too light for me which is
really surprising but it just was so
that's gonna go these Kevin Taquan ones
I never reach for though these like
they're almost I don't know they're just
kind of weird I like them all right now
I'm leaning towards some that I
genuinely do like this Dior blush I love
this was a splurge when I bought it and
I still really like it it's in the shade
my rose being that one
okay so I've got all of these here three
strobing blushes some flower and this
Ulta one these flower Beauty ones are
gorgeous
the old one is nice but I don't
eat it I've got too many colors just the
same and then which one these Oh Jessica
I think mrs. summer peach or is it mrs.
amber brown that I really liked I think
it's mrs. amber brown that I really like
someone to keep that and pass on the
other two let's start gorgeous
and then I think I'm gonna keep both of
these or maybe I'll just keep the pink
flower one and pass on the peach what's
this one called peach Primrose
I liked this though I'll just keep the
pink one
these NARS ones I've got deep throat and
I've got sin sin is so dark let me think
about those two these number seven ones
are also really nice but a lot of them
are way too bright or dark so those
three can go this one peach velvet oh
yeah this is what I do like it's kind of
a brighter peach I like that I have
these two Mac ones I have eternal Sun
it's a little brown and then I have
Melba I freaking love Melba no that is
different than Dallas I'm gonna pass on
eternal Sun gonna pass on let me think
about those still this collab one is
actually a really nice everyday pink
color kind of a bluish pink but is it
the same as the flower do I really need
both let me try
yeah I feel like these are pretty
similar so I'll keep the flower pass on
collab the collab one is really nice
it's Papa don't peach one is really
really pretty it is a little more
glimmery but this is such a pretty blush
so I don't mind keeping that one these
sleep ones are too bright too too bright
they're a nice price they're really
pigmented but I'm never gonna wear that
even with a light hand it's not gonna
happen so those are gonna go my Becca
ones here I really like all of these
songbird
so there what is this flower child and I
think camellia I'm not ready to get give
these up yet you know I think I think
I'm gonna pass on deep throat from NARS
and keep this one cuz they're really
really similar and then these are like
the only two deeper brighter blushes i
have which i think is kind of fun
like for winter time so i think i am
gonna keep these two and I know I love
that one so there we go so that's not
too too bad and then I have two
hourglass palates do I really need both
problem is I really like both this one I
like more it's got more variety so I can
travel with it and I have a lot of
options with what I'm gonna wear
so that's one thing but it gets so dirty
but it's so good so I think I'm gonna
pass this one on I'm surprised to see
myself do it but I'm gonna pass this one
on I'm surprising myself so do I really
need both of these hourglass blushes is
the real question let me swatch this one
again such a pretty color but do I
really need it this one I know I love so
I'm not getting rid of it so it's like
light but it's it looks nice on the skin
I can't really explain that one I feel
like it's between this and sin because
sin is a very similar well not really
they're a little bit different
I think if it's between this and sin I
should keep the hourglass because I feel
like it's but that one has such a
glitter in it I think I'm gonna pass on
the hourglass one it just has too much
glitter so now looking through these and
deciding is there anything left that I
want to get rid of I think I might pass
on the balm balm Beach I've got too many
shades similar here I really do the
number seven one I don't need I can pass
that one on okay I feel good about that
I don't like I don't look out on this
and feel guilty about keeping any one
thing so I think that is a good feeling
is everything I'm getting rid of I am
very proud of myself again products that
I've had for so long that I do like but
if I'm not using them enough there's no
point in keeping them and then I can
really focus in on the ones I absolutely
adore you know what I mean so I feel
really good about the amount that I'm
getting rid of versus what I'm keeping
