ridiculous that I even need a drawer for
primer so my goal is to cut this by like
75% and so my three categories I do is
my donate slash giveaway pile and some
of them of course will just go in the
trash but like if they're super old or
whatever and then I also have sorry I
did a lift to clutter I can't get it off
you guys I'm just stained and then I'm
gonna do a pile of keep of course and
then a pile of products that I just
haven't tried long enough to know how I
feel but I'm gonna keep those in a
separate area and that's kind of how
I've decided that I have to do this
because this is one of my jobs because I
don't want to get rid of something that
maybe I've tried once and like I think I
like it
well it doesn't necessarily deserve to
go if I really don't know if it's worth
keeping or not yet so that's gonna be
how I do this let me spread these out
over my little area there and we will
get started okay so here we go I counted
the other day I have like 60 something
primers hold on I might have a few up
here yep yep alright so oh my goodness
like I said I'm gonna try to be very
ruthless because I keep doing the
clutters and then I feel like well I
didn't really get rid of anything I'm so
sorry about my hand I know it's annoying
like I watch the clutter something like
drives me crazy but it's all lip
swatches I can't get off it alright so
right off the bat these milk ones I'm
gonna get rid of the illuminating one I
just have never cared about so that can
go and then this one I've had for quite
a while I do like it but I don't find
myself reaching for it a ton I have
other blurring primers I use on my nose
that I like better so both of those are
gonna go
these primer waters these primer spray I
don't have any desire to try from jcat
so I'm gonna pass those on while they're
new this I absolutely adore
however it's I can't it's not like sold
in the States any more at least as far
as I've seen I don't know why I think
well I think it is but it's only on Kat
Reese's website so I find myself using
this less and less even though I love it
and I have had it for quite a while now
so
I think I'm just gonna pass it on maybe
even toss it I did not like this Ulta
primer that one can go
let's see angel veil is nice but frankly
I used to keep it because I'm like oh
it's a drugstore dupe but frankly this
is like sixteen dollars now so it's
hardly a drugstore product so I don't
reach for it much and I don't really
need to keep it for dupe purposes so I'm
gonna get rid of it um let's see I have
a lot of these like lumi products I'm
gonna keep the lighter one I think but
if I'm keeping like four or five
Lumi type primers then I might not keep
this one does that make sense so I'm
gonna keep it for now but then I'll go
back through my pile at the end with you
guys and show you like let me take this
one out that kind of stuff we shall see
pore filler I really just don't use this
first light is basically gone I'm
planning on buying the full size on the
Ulta 21 Beauty days of sale what 21 days
of beauty but you'll probably be seen
this way after that sale so we'll see
but I'm gonna go and this is ready to go
in the trash see this is the problem I
have all these are all like glowy kinds
of primers so let me put all of these
together how about that and I'm gonna
pull that Lumi one back in what are my
other glowy I think that's a glowy
primer it's not technically glowy I
think I got most of the glowy primers
here my favorites out of all of these I
love this onna me powerful priming serum
it's kind of got a shimmer to it but
it's got really good skincare and really
I wish all of these were like that so
out of all of these I know I'm gonna
keep this one that's the first primer
I'm keeping officially how exciting I
don't ever reach for this or the
covergirl nothing wrong with either one
but again I have far too many why keep
them all so that's on I don't reach for
the L'Oreal visible lift the hook is
focused the elf glow lotion these are
all nice this Urban Decay
but again I don't need all of these the
Revlon Photoready pour word oh that's a
pore reducing primer
let me think about that one kiss strobe
cream and peach light I don't use very
often I kind of want to get like the
original strobe cream again let me think
about that one too the skin illuminator
is really nice these are all nice okay
out of these two I'd rather keep the
number seven so I'm gonna pass on the
Loreal the dewy is just like these these
are like all three the same which is
awesome but do I really need all three
I've already mentioned these in a dupes
video they're both so good but I really
don't need both knowing that I'm not
going to get through both of these so
that's what makes me think maybe I pass
this on I know that sounds crazy but I'm
really trying to have a curated
collection of only a couple of primers
and if I'm gonna do this I've got to do
it right you know what I mean so I can
get rid of this Catrice one for sure I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of these two
I know I'm gonna keep the back of one
because I really do love this the
spotlight is just the same but I don't
need both and if I've already spent the
money on a one you know let me see this
number seven this might need to go in my
try a little bit before I pass it on
that is so pretty hey I got more that
lip product off I had to use like the
ICO mascara off more wipes to get it
okay sorry that was totally off topic um
I think that I'm just gonna get rid of
them all I know that's insane
and I know some of you guys are probably
freaking out but I'd rather donate them
so someone can be using them you know I
think that's it I part of me feels
really guilty for having all of this
stuff I just don't need it
alright so this too should clot blur
primer from YSL I use all the time
absolutely love I always have good
makeup days when I use this so I'm
keeping three primers so far getting rid
of like 15 these little minis unless
it's one I absolutely love like the way
I so many I'll keep because I travel
with it I don't need these too so I'll
keep the little why I sell travel one
and get rid of that one again I've got
these two I think I'll keep the Mac
strobe cream but the blemish one let me
think about these I am going to keep the
Mac one but I'm gonna put it in my
travel drawer I just use this today and
could not believe how good it was the
ordinary hide here in Silla
on primer really really enjoyed this so
I am gonna keep that one
I'd like forgotten how good it is this
fancy beauty one I keep using and not
really caring about so I'm finally gonna
pass it on oh that's a good feeling the
calming primer I a love love love 24
months how long have I had this that's
my concern with this one is I've had it
for a while so I think I might pass this
on kind of makes me sad but at the same
time like it's it's just old so my pass
on I mean toss because I do think it's
old this Ilia thing I'm not even sure
what it is and it doesn't say it says
cucumber water stick I don't know what
you're supposed to do with it it doesn't
really feel nice on the skin so I'm
gonna pass it on I have all these
hydrating primers so out of these I
really do like my primer Iser so I'm
gonna keep that one this stellar one I
didn't really care for so I'm gonna pass
that one on this is difficult the elf
ones good but I don't find myself
reaching for it much the coqui one was
actually pretty good
oh my gosh one of my favorites my Laura
Mercier hydrating primer like this stuff
is amazing so I'm definitely gonna keep
it definitely my probably my favorite
hydrating primer with that in mind again
I've got a dupe here but do I really
need both dupes this next one's almost
gone so I think I'm just gonna throw
this away / maybe just use it up put it
my everyday makeup drawer and then keep
the Smashbox one because they're the
same product but I use my NYX one up
that's pretty nice this Too Faced one
does feel nice but I don't find myself
reaching for it and I'm not really sure
why cuz it does feel good when I use it
so I think I'm gonna keep this past
these on and honestly I just think this
Marc Jacobs one is old I'm gonna I'm
gonna get rid of it I've got all these
primer oils these are amazing I
literally love I think all of these I
just recently got a new one I'm trying
missing here Oh
okay so out of all of these I don't need
them all obviously this is a new
favorites from Kevin o Quan I think I
broke the lid though like yeah like I
literally broke the lid oh my gosh
Jessica you freaking idiot but it's so
good now you kind of shake it up I'm
really not even sure if you're supposed
to but I do and it really is weightless
it's like in the skin so much quicker
than any of these it's the craziest
thing so I do think I'm gonna keep this
and you know what I'm gonna get rid of
the two-faced one I don't care enough
about it
alright these far Sally ones I don't
know I think they're good but do I
really need to keep them the unicorn
essence is like a pink one I don't
really care about it I think they're
kind of the rose gold elixir I did like
but I don't need all of these like this
primer argan oil where spray I'm just
gonna catch these on I am so proud of
myself I really loved this derma eat one
oh my gosh does have glitter in it you
do have to kind of shake not glitter cuz
it doesn't show up that way but again
I've already done this dupe do I really
need both of these probably not so I'll
go ahead and keep the expensive one just
cuz well I've already spent the money
guys these are the same product I'm
telling you but I know a sister has her
eye on this so okay and then I think
I'll keep this - I just love primer oils
alright some that I think I'm just gonna
go ahead and pass on just looking here
there's nothing wrong with these I just
I've used some once they're talking like
this he's a couple times I just don't
care about the urban decay it's ok again
it's got SPF 30 which is really nice but
I don't know see with these that's where
I get torn once we get into SPS I'm like
maybe I need to keep it this is so old
I've had this forever SPF of 50 which is
awesome but I'm pretty sure it's expired
and that you don't mess around with SPF
and you know what I've had these a while
too so I'm just gonna get rid of them
this elf color correcting liquid primer
no freaking way I did not like it
this brightening primer was ok it was
actually pretty good but not good enough
that I really am dying to keep it you
know this Milani touch-up stick
and it's okay I don't like it enough to
keep this the ordinary product is so old
I it's disgusting
this is so gross twelve months it's
definitely been longer than that it's
their high spreadability that's gonna go
these makeup transforming drops I don't
need those colors this osmotics primer
right I just don't care I'm sorry I know
that sounds terrible I just I'd rather
someone else have them okay what is the
date on this does it say it's in another
language I don't know this stuff is
amazing my friend Laura turned me on to
this you have to like buy it online
because it's not sold here in the states
SPF of 50 it's probably getting close to
a year old so I'd probably be nearing
the end of using this and then I have
this new SPF of 30 pharmacy product that
I want to try like I haven't even opened
it so I'm thinking that's all the SPF I
need so I don't feel too badly about
getting rid of that other stuff I'll use
this up and then move on to this so I've
got all of these like pour kind of
filling primers honestly out of this one
is to this blurring one here out of all
of these this is the best one it's so
expensive I
I know so some people love this some
people don't I've tried the tarte
timeless clean slate and I cannot get it
to work for me but the top just stuff is
freakin amazing it's a little bit more
emollient so I find that my dry skin
soaks it up I only use it on my nose and
t-zone area this stuff is amazing it
blows everything else out of the water
so like the cover FX blurring primer the
bye-bye pores hourglass mineral vent
that's so good too though but a part of
me is kind of like do I even keep any of
these do I just get rid of them I think
I might just get rid of them oh my gosh
I'm feeling very proud of myself right
now I did not think I'd be able to get
rid of all of those so my last few are
just kind of random quatre
I don't know how to categorize oh this
is a moisturizer so it doesn't
technically belong in here these are
technically both moisturizers and I
really like them both the Hello fab
oh the first day Beauty coconut skin
priming moisturizer and then the
cosmetics humidified deep moisture oh my
gosh these are both amazing let me see
this I feel like I've not tried enough
this YSL so I feel like I should put
that in that drawer to actually like try
the elf number 7 I'm gonna pass on this
cabinet Quan thing I've had forever I've
used it twice didn't really care about
it
Maybelline's okay this original skin
origin stuff is really really cool but
mine's all clogged and I tried to clean
it out and it still wouldn't work so I
don't know what the deal is I really
really like this stuff but I'm gonna go
ahead and toss it you guys have no idea
I've tried so hard you can see little
bits that came out when I thought I got
it cleaned out but I didn't anyway so
that's gonna go this lore primer again I
feel like I need to try both of these
some more because they're so expensive
this one I bought this one was sent to
me and I just I don't feel right getting
rid of them without really having any
idea how I feel this I only used like
two or three times and I know some
people love so these are gonna I'm gonna
continue to try I'm just gonna pass
these to one so this is all I'm keeping
that's it I know it's still way more
primer than I'll ever need but I am very
very proud of myself I'm thinking about
I might pass this on I feel like I
really like it but I end up reaching for
these more often for every single day
and this is the one product that
everytime I keep looking at these I
start feeling guilty about keeping so
I'll pass that on to someone that will
love it these are two that I'm wanting
to try out some more and then the rest
of these I've got my moisturizers my SPF
my pore filling some travel and then my
little beauty oils some hydrating wands
some more like kind of not shimmery
glimmery glowy ones and then just some
standard primers I don't think that's
too bad I'm really proud are you guys
ready to see what I'm getting rid of oh
my gosh this is crazy like I looked in
the shore and I thought oh certainly I'm
going to
keeping you know this and this and this
and I'm getting rid of so many that I
thought I would hold on to but you know
what I a lot of them I was keeping
because of the brand name or cuz other
people like them but if I'm not reaching
for him why not pass them to someone
that will love them and they're just
taking up space so I love that my little
collection here is so much more curated
it feels so good one thing I'm realizing
is you'll notice I really don't have any
drugstore primers and it's not that I
don't love drugstore you guys know I try
it out but like this one is basically
gone and then the rest of them like
there's so many really good glowy ones
so it's not that I don't like them but
if I spent the money on both the
drugstore and the high-end and I'm only
gonna be able to use one up I think I'd
rather just use the high-end if they're
both the same you don't have saying so I
don't want you guys to feel like oh of
course you got rid of all these
drugstore ones so that clearly shows not
really it's just that you know I spent
my money where I spent it and I want to
make sure if they're the same thing that
I'm getting my money's worth in that way
because there's no way in the world
after reviewing these that I could
possibly use them all up so if you
enjoyed this style of declutter
definitely subscribe stay tuned for many
more declutter as I'm filming a bunch
