some liquid lipsticks and I have my lip
liners up there I'll pull down when
we're ready to do it so they're all kind
of they're kind of separated but they're
like most of those are liquid lipsticks
but they're kind of mixed in I don't
think it really matters let's just start
so the way I like to start my two
clutters is by looking at it and saying
okay what would I buy again so what
sticks out to me is something I would
totally buy again I love this Marc
Jacobs lip lip gloss it's in the shade
moon glow and it's just a really pretty
light very simple you can barely even
see it lip gloss so this is one I just
recently bought I'm still excited about
so I'm definitely going to keep that one
um this is one of my favorites it's from
Rimmel it's an blushing Belle graves
just a really simple lip gloss kind of
iowa's called a grey pink it's so pretty
definitely going to keep that this is
one of my favorite liquid lipsticks I
wear this all the time it's completely
worn off but it's by color pop and it's
in bad habit I might always call it bad
behavior but it's bad habit and it's
just this gorgeous berry I'm gonna wipe
it off really quickly before it stains
my hand anymore than it's already saying
but I love this so much I just filmed my
lipstick declutter before this so my
hands are a mess um I really like these
smashbox always on lip liquid lipsticks
but I don't this one's in always this
ones in in demand I really like that
color and then this one's in babe alert
feel like I don't need both but I really
like both I think I'm in a silky boat
cuz they actually are quite different
colors and I just love this formula it's
so comfortable
I really like this formula these two
infallible Pro matte glosses so I'm
definitely going to keep both I love
that format it's like a whipped kind of
formula these over liquid lipsticks I
they actually just sent me a ton of them
but they're I literally just got them so
they're still in boxes I'm not going to
get rid of any of them because I want to
try them out it's actually one of the
ones they sent called Atlantic City it's
just this beautiful red and then this is
one I've gotten like in a box of some
kind it's called mocha I love these it's
honestly it's the best liquid like
lipstick formula I've ever tried
comfortable it stays on all day amazing
so definitely keeping those and keeping
the other ones in veteran
boxes there so for the rest of these
let's just start going one by one
because I really don't know I kind of am
really in that mood to get rid of a
bunch this is too much to sort through
when I'm looking for a gloss right off
the bat these three bareMinerals lip
glosses I'm just going to keep one of
them this one in flirt looks like a
color I don't really have it's kind of
like this purplish gray and I really
just think that's such a cool different
color so I think I'm going to keep this
and get rid of these just because I
don't need this one's in forbidden and
this one's in totally and I just don't
need all of those so keep one get rid of
two not bad
these elf ones this pout Perfector is
really cool it's like this crazy
glittery lip gloss so I'm going to keep
this but I think this one I actually
really like it but I'm not ever reaching
for cuz I have so many this one's in
bitten pink and it's a beautiful color
very very pigmented but I just don't
need it so pass on I really like this
glam art gloss it's from Misha Beauty
it's a pretty peach I really don't have
a lot of peaches and it's just so
comfortable it smells good and the
packaging is beautiful so I'm going to
keep that I'm going to keep this I have
the whole collection of the sweet peach
things I'm planning on filming a video
about the entire collection here soon so
I don't want to I only have one out here
the rest are still in their boxes but I
wanted to remember to mention it it's a
nice for me I don't think it's like
life-changing by any means but it smells
like peaches which I think smells really
nice especially in the summer time just
kind of a classic lip gloss so not like
change your life but still good so I'm
going to keep that and the other ones
until I film the video and then I might
declutter after that some of those these
are the new rim will my gloss lip
glosses and I have non-stop glamour and
stay my rows non-stop glamour is one of
my favorite like peachy colored ones
this is actually the new packaging but
it's this glittery beautiful peach so
I'm going to keep that I think I'm going
to pass it on pass on say my rose I just
don't really it's just another pink one
you know got too many this Revlon ones
getting pretty old it's in Supernatural
it's their Super Lustrous one it's just
it's a pretty color
but it's just getting pretty old these
two I'm just never reaching for it's a
Catrice one and a bellapierre one I'm
going to pass them on this elf one I
thought I would reach for more than I do
but I don't I don't reach for any of
these three things so I'm passing them
on these I like both of these these are
kind of dupes for each other but I like
them both so I'm going to keep them okay
so these are from by Terry it was sent
to me I'm never going to wear the purple
or the gray or the white now these two I
might actually wear so these are the
bomb De Rose and Neutra color this one's
in 200 I haven't even opened this so
really pretty like light pink isn't it
pretty
so I'm going to keep that let me try
this like peach see it already looks
like it's separating but I haven't even
opened these yet that's kind of a cool
color so I think I'm gonna keep those
two but I'm going to pass on these
colors I know I'm just in my heart never
going to wear all right so moving along
right here I've got this gerard
cosmetics I don't know if it's a liquid
lipstick or lip gloss but it's in nude
and it's really pretty
must be a lip gloss it's a really pretty
nude color and this is the only thing
from gerard cosmetics I own I'm not an
affiliate or anything like them but yes
I think I'll hold on to that for now
this is my beloved NYX beige lip gloss
it's called beige but it's this
beautiful pink eye this is the second
one I bought I love it definitely
keeping okay on further investigation of
this L'Oreal infallible one that I was
going to keep earlier in the pink it
doesn't look very good on me so I'm
gonna pass that one these three liquid
lipsticks literally look the exact same
the steel one I've had for quite a while
I think I'm going to pass that one on
the Milani one I've had for a while too
so I think I'm going to keep this before
and pass on the Milani because I've had
those other two for a very like
embarrassingly long time now I have a
couple of Reds here that are liquid
lipsticks the Kat Von D one I have to
admit I was not very impressed with when
I compare this to the Oprah one the Kat
Von D one cracked everywhere and it just
didn't stay on dry why to keep
reapplying it whereas the Oprah ones
like we're comfortable they say I mean
it's unbelievable so I'm going to
get rid of this because I just didn't
love it this nuance one I don't remember
why I kept this from the last one oh
it's kind of a lip gloss I don't need
that I'm going to pass it on
alright so this is a bright pink liquid
lipstick from Mac in two matte with love
but it's spelled ma te it's a really
pretty bright pink liquid lipstick let
me try it on and see if it actually
looks good on me actually it doesn't
look bad so I'm going to keep that these
two are from Giorgio Armani and they're
still pretty new to me I got them from
Influenster is their lip magnet in 400
it's kind of like a red orange kind of
thing that's really pretty
and then this one is in 505 looks like a
kind of standard pink yeah so definitely
keeping these I want to actually try
them out perhaps review them my channel
and then this is the Too Faced melted
I just never ever wear this I'm going to
get rid of it I don't know why I keep
holding on to it like I'm ever going to
change my mind but I never I don't like
applying it alright so I have my color
blurs here I think I am going to get rid
of this this red one called pardon my
crimson I don't know if when I'm wanting
a red like this I don't want it to look
like that I don't know it's kind of a
dull red so I'm going to pass that one
on
I like oops I like to mauve it I think
it's one that I really really like maybe
and then this one's similar I think this
is I'm blushing
oh yeah that one's much more ping so
there's actually the colors on here
looks similar but they're actually very
different and then this one's in berry
misbehaved I like this one a lot it's a
really cool bright pink I really like
that so I think I'm going to keep all of
them these are I like the color blurs I
think they're I just like them that's
why I keep buying more colors that that
partner in crimson is not my favorite so
I'm going to pass that one on so this is
a bite Beauty
line and defined lip primer I haven't
even tried this yet so I do want to give
that one a shot out of these I know that
I love this one this is a star looks one
called Paula's Choice and it's this
beautiful so what it's not polished
choice
it's called Terry's choice and it's this
beautiful berry I always use this lip
liner when I wear a berry lip so I love
that super creamy I love the color pop
lip liners these are colored there look
how crazy it looks though I kept
sharpening it and it now it just looks
crazy but it's a really pretty kind of
trendy color right now looks crazy
though but I really do like that this is
the only red I currently have and to be
honest it's not that great since 714 and
it's an OK red lip liner but it is not
great so I'm going to keep it but I need
to keep my eyes peeled for a better one
I love this Mac staunchly stylish one
kind of a nude colored I have a couple
Gen nude ones but they're not very good
like they're kind of dry this one's in
vibe I'm gonna get rid of maybe this one
was in vibe they're just not great I
don't think I need this color here I
just don't ever wear lip colors like
that I don't have a bright pink so I
feel like I should keep it
you know this one is a Kiko one and 3:02
that one I have nothing like so I'm
definitely keeping that I actually
really do like that and this one is a
deck of scarlet one and it's kind of a
nude one as well looks like it looks
just like that one what was that one
staunchly stylish let me see no it's a
little bit different pretty similar
though but I really like both so I'm
going to keep both because that's about
the only color I wear all the time
this is everything I'm keeping that's
what I'm getting rid of I would say I
did pretty well as I kind of look I see
a lot of similar colors and that's kind
of frustrating to me but for these
they're you know like the bareMinerals
one I like having at least one from
those since I do like the formula if I
want to reference them or anything like
that so I think I still did pretty well
there's some that again as I try more of
them like my over liquid lipsticks and
the two-faced ones that I have in my
other room once I tried them out they'll
probably you know some of them will be
weeded out but I feel good about what
I'm getting rid of I'm not going to miss
any of them color wise or formula wise
whichever if you enjoyed the clutters as
much as I do I will link my playlist
below I've been doing declutter for
years so you can watch tons and tons of
declutter videos and I hope that you'll
subscribe to catch my future once and I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
