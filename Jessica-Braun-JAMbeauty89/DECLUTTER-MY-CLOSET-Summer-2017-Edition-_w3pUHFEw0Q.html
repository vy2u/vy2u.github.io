going to show you my new closet at my
new house now I need to organize it and
that is the goal of this video I'm in
summer mode right now in my head and I
know a lot of you guys are too and for
me we just moved in and all of this is
just mixing together I've got dresses
and winter shirts and summer shirts it's
just a big ole mess so I just bought
some new summer pieces and I wanted to
show them to you guys and also weed out
some of my old summer pieces that maybe
they're just not my style anymore maybe
they don't fit me anymore they're old
they're tattered whatever the reason
might be
I love decluttering and I love sharing
my journey with you guys so let's go
ahead and get into it so as you can see
all of my clothes are just completely
mixed in I've got you know tank tops mix
with Blazers mixed with kind of more
dressy shirts I mean it's just all
together I've got sweaters as well
so I really need to reorganize I'd like
in the end to have my summer stuff
together and my winter stuff together
and made me like Blazers can be together
things like that so that is my goal I'm
not gonna worry about like shoes and
accessories today I just want to focus
on the clothing portion you see any of
my special friends up there if you can
name all three of those things up there
you win at life another quick tip is to
purchase one of these they're really
inexpensive if you don't have a lot of
room in your closet or you don't have
like dressers or drawers and you need
somewhere to store pants and shorts
these are so inexpensive you can use
these for anything you can use them for
sweaters if you don't want to hang
sweaters it's really not ideal to but
for me right now I don't have the space
to put sweaters anywhere else
thread up is actually sponsoring this
video and they are who I picked out my
news summer clothing from I love thread
up because they are really inexpensive
they sell secondhand clothing most of it
is in like new condition and I've done a
couple videos with them because I love
them and I'm always upfront with you
guys when I'm being sponsored they did
give me a 40% off discount code which I
will link below if you're interested in
trying it for yourself what I love about
the website is it makes buying second
hand really easy because you can type in
your size and the type of clothing
you're looking for and it filters it
that way so you're not looking at a
bunch of stuff and falling in love with
something and then realizing oh they
don't have it in my size so it makes it
really easy there are so much on this
website it's insane and so yeah I just
wanted to show you guys what I picked up
I don't have their packaging
always so cute I've already torn into
this because I was way too excited but I
picked out a bunch of things so so for
example I picked out this cute black
dress it's really really form-fitted so
I need to be a little bit more fit I
think but just one of those really
pretty like cocktail type dresses I
picked out this cute tank top isn't this
so adorable I was really excited about
this because I feel like I can dress it
up or I can like tuck it into some like
jean shorts and make it look cute in
that way too these bright orange shorts
these are from j.crew and I feel like
j.crew can be so expensive and these
were so inexpensive and all of these are
in really really great condition this
little dress made my heart happy and I
just thought I just want it it's gonna
be a looser fitting dress but it has
these really cute like almost Minnie
Mouse like pockets and I just thought
that was so sweet I could totally wear
it to work to teach in but I could also
if you I felt like I could dress it up
at the Blazer I could wear it as it is
in the summertime just so many different
things I could do with that then I
picked out this dress because it has
pockets
anyone that likes dresses knows that a
dress with pockets is like the most
amazing thing it was a really nice
quality and I just thought the pattern
was so pretty something different red
and gray I got these beautiful blue
shorts from Express now these are these
literally feel brand new I mean they
look like they were never worn ever and
that oh my gosh it was so inexpensive
then I got this little dress this is
actually from Target and what's funny is
I actually remember seeing this at
Target awhile back and I remember they
didn't have my size and I was so sad so
it was so crazy seeing it online I
thought oh my gosh that's so perfect
but I just thought it was so cute and
flouncy and it looks really comfortable
then I got just this Victoria's Secret
pink little like workout tank I figure
that's perfect to throw on and go on a
run I burn through workout shirt so I
love that I can get some that are
essentially not even used but for really
cheap since I wear them all the time I
wear them out then we got this cute
dressy tank from forever 21 and it looks
like it's never been worn as well but I
just love this cream
I used to have a shirt like this but
this one looks like I would wear it a
little bit more often I thought that
crisscross pattern was so beautiful then
I figured this this was actually more of
a work purchase this is from express
it's just a cream top but I figured that
would look awesome under a blazer and it
actually be pretty comfortable then I
got this strapless tank and this was
from a White House Black Market and I
loved how it looked like it was kind of
wrapped and I clearly loved black and
white stripes then I got a lot of stuff
I was like really going to town but when
it's so much cheaper it's you just can't
stop yourself this adorable dress it's
from this brand called fire Los Angeles
and it's just this gorgeous like it's
got this cute lacy detail it's shimmery
and I thought it just kind of reminded
me of the 20s in a way and I loved that
about it and then lastly I got a tank
top from Target just to throw on with a
pair of jean shorts
I loved the bright colors and it just
looked really comfortable okay so I
pulled out all of my tank tops and short
sleeve shirts that I would wear in the
summertime so this is one that I just
recently got it's got this really cute
design on the back so I want to keep
this I've only worn it like once same
with this one I love how this is pleated
I think it's so pretty and it looks
great with the Blazer this I think it's
just comfortable to wear it's cotton and
I don't I feel like I don't have a ton
of just plain cotton tank tops so I like
to keep some just because it's just
comfortable in the summer this is a more
dressy one from Express that I really
really like so I wanted to keep that one
as well
oh this is a dress I love this dress so
this is one that's really really another
comfortable just kind of bumming around
the house kind of a tape top this one's
pretty too I brought it with me on my
recent trip so I'm gonna keep that one
this one I brought with me and I
realized I didn't like it because of
this collar so I'm going to get rid of
it I'm never this is one of those things
that I like but I'm not ever gonna take
the time to like try to iron that little
delicate piece so for that reason I'm
just gonna have to pass it on sorry cute
shirt
this one's comfortable it has like a fly
open back which is really I think it's
just cute and fun and I just like the
pattern so I'm gonna keep that one I
love this one as well it's just really
flowy this one I'm gonna pass on it's so
cute
awkward to hang but it's one of those
you know it's off one shoulder but it
just sits weird on me and it makes me
feel uncomfortable so I'm gonna pass
that one on as well good always good to
be honest with yourself this is really
cute and comfy I just like it if it's
very like peasanty and very forgiving if
you're feeling bloated that day which I
like this one I like as well again very
similar but I like the design on the
bottom this one I think I bought and I
have never worn but it's so cute I think
it'd look really pretty tucked into like
a black like long skirt or something
like that so I do want to keep it this
is an odd one you know what I think I
might put this with my workout shirts
because I think I will wear it more
often like that then I will like hung up
because it's not really I don't know
like it's not that kind of a shirt I
feel like I don't know so I'm gonna put
this with my workout clothing I love
this tank top it ties in the back and I
just think it's cute I like this one as
well it's got the like little sleeve a
thumb I love this yellow one I'm gonna
keep that bright and sunny this one I
haven't worn yet I've washed and it got
a little warm just in washing it but
it's the kind that almost looks like
it's tucked in when you're wearing it
which i think is kind of cool so I want
to at least try that out another cotton
one that's comfy to wear in the
summertime I love this this is one that
I wear with leggings a lot it's kind of
like you know draped off the shoulder
but it's really comfy as well I really
like this one as well it looks great
under a blazer so I'm gonna keep that
one this one I always think about
passing on but my husband every time I
wear it my husband just loves on me and
I don't really know why so it's kind of
those things that I do like it and I
think I'm gonna keep it for that reason
then I've got this cute old navy tank
it's just comfy so I'm gonna keep that I
really like this I got from Kohl's
this one I wear all the time again it's
great with just leggings you just toss
it on its loose this one I got from that
who what where brand from Target and I
think it's awesome so I'm gonna keep
that I wear that one just wore this the
other day just an old Navy tank top this
I really really like it's from loft and
I
someone keep that this looks awesome
with jean shorts this I think I I
recently got this one I think I would
wear that to work with like a black
camisole underneath this is a dress
which I just think is so cute and I love
the pattern
put it with the dresses this is just a
cotton kind of a tank top from Elle I
think I got it
is that Kohl's I mean I just love it I
love the color this one I go back and
forth with it's weird because I get
compliments on it like when I've worn it
to work with like leggings but I just
feel like it's a weird top I don't know
that's gonna be a maybe this one I'm
gonna pass on I keep keeping it thinking
I'll wear it and I never ever wear it so
it's just time goodbye
cute little shirt this one I do like
this I've had it awhile but I do like it
I just feel like I never ever wear it
I'm gonna keep it for now this I'm going
to go ahead and pass on I liked for a
long time but I never actually ended up
wearing it I like this one so I'm going
to keep that this is the most
comfortable tank ever it's more like a
tunic so I wear it with leggings and a
blazer to work and I love it this is
more of a pj top so I'm gonna take that
off cuz I it's one that I'm not gonna
wear out it's too I don't know frumpy
but it's comfortable this is one of
those like things you pin under it's
really cute I like tucking in into like
more dressy shorts so definitely keeping
that this is completely see-through it's
so cute but I can't find a way to wear
it where you don't see everything
underneath and the camisole just doesn't
look right because it's a shorter more
cropped tank top so I'm just gonna pass
it on I love this one I forgot I even
own this it's one that's draped off the
shoulders as well but I love that pink
this is just a comfy one for work under
a blazer as well so I'm gonna keep that
got this cute white kind of dressy one
that I think is really pretty and then
my off-white like cream shirt I wear all
the time and then I love this
she wore this top two that want the
two-faced event in LA that I went to
last I think it was December tucked into
a long black skirt and I thought I just
love the scalloped edges so I'm only
getting rid of one two three four five
shirts but I feel like these are all
things that every time I see them in the
closet I'm like okay it's time to get
rid of that you know what I mean and so
it already feels better I'm excited
let's go organize so the first thing I'm
going to do is separate the tank tops
from the like short sleeves you know
what I think I'm going to get rid of
this as well just because I've had this
for a long time it's kind of worn the
zipper is a little bit broken in spot so
it's just time
ok so now it's time to put these in the
closet and organize the other parts of
it I found a couple more pieces I wanted
to get rid of I'm gonna finally get rid
of this if you watch any of my declutter
as I go back and forth but it just makes
me look really frumpy so I'm gonna pass
that on this is just too structured and
oddly like big and it's just not
comfortable to wear so I'm gonna pass
the bomber jacket on and then this is
well gosh all three of those are from
Target I just don't ever wear it and I
kept thinking I would and I never did so
I'm gonna pass all three of those on so
that's good now our total is 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 shirts feeling lighter already 10
I forgot about this bomber jacket okay
so I finally have it organized I've got
all of my tank tops here which is so
nice and then I've got my short sleeve
and then into long sleeve and like
quarter length then I have all my
cardigan type sweaters here and then my
Blazers and bomber jackets are there got
like my kimonos together my sweaters my
like North Face type things vests and
then over here I have like skirts and
then all of my dresses and then any crop
tops I have here I want to see if I'm
gonna actually wear them this summer and
if I don't I'm gonna pass those on and
then here with the shorts I kind of went
through them and I realize you know I
don't want to get rid of any of these
just yet all of them are ones that I'm
wearing I've recently got rid of some
shorts and then my pants I went through
those before we move so for right now
those are all ones than those you can't
see they're down below but I feel really
good about this I didn't get rid of a
ton but I certainly got rid of a good
amount enough that when I buy new
clothes I like to get rid of some
because I don't want my closet to I mean
I've got way too many clothes as it is
it's already overwhelming so I don't
want to end up just accumulating tons of
cute clothing but never getting rid of
anything so some of my decluttering tips
because I know some of you guys like to
just kind of hear it from me my thought
process if you're curious about how I
usually do clutter I've tried so many
different ways I love decluttering so I
will link some of my past videos down
below but for me today what I learned
was that if it's a piece that every time
look in the closet it catches my eye but
not in a good way
like I always see it no Micah and I
never ever want to wear it it's time to
get rid of it it's one of those things
that if you have those pieces that stick
out like a sore thumb it's probably a
sign that it's time to get rid of it if
you're just annoyed every time you see
it or maybe you feel guilty every time
you see it because it was something you
spent money on and you never wear pass
it on you've already spent the money
it's already gone that's just a sign
that it's time to let it go someone else
will end up loving it and then you don't
have to feel guilty every time you've
already spent the money so just let the
guilt go away and that's also a great
lesson for us in the future say us you
me anyone that shops ever just that you
know just because something's on
clearance and you're like oh my gosh
it's on clearance I should buy it it's
my size doesn't necessarily mean that
it's something you're gonna wear so why
even spend the three dollars and ninety
cents on that clearance shirt if you
know that well you don't really need it
and it's not really your style or you
know whatever the reason might be just
because it's a good deal does not mean
you must buy it save that money spend it
on something you genuinely genuinely
want so for me as I've been shopping
what I ask myself is when I look at it I
think am I gonna still be thinking about
this shirt in like a week like pan I
should have bought that shirt that's a
good sign to buy it especially if it's
something that's an investment so
