Pinocchio's cage we have one of our
friends staying with us right now so so
what am i explaining all this to you
guys anyway so we have his cage in my
room because normally it's in the guest
room it doesn't matter anyway so I'm
just on my bedroom floor there's where
usually film and I am decluttering some
stuff now I'm gonna be honest I've
already started to cluttering because I
was like I just need to like I was in
the mood and I was like I don't really
it's it's more difficult it's hard to
explain but it's difficult to film it
because you almost your thought process
is different and I feel like I'm even
more cutthroat when I declutter not
filming if that makes any sense and if
you've ever filmed declutter yourself
you probably know what I mean but you
might understand me regardless so I'm
gonna show you so far kind of where I am
in the process what I've decided to get
rid of I'm hoping to get rid of some
more and then there's still some parts
that I haven't gone through so let me
flip the camera around I apologize for
the lighting but this is just real life
so these so far are brushes that I'm
wanting to keep and then I've got this
giant pile of brushes that I know for
sure I'm getting rid of some of them are
absolutely brand new some of them I've
tried a couple times in some I've just
had for years and it's just time so I
apologize ahead of time I've half of
these are dirty and half are clean I'm
trying to keep them separate like those
are clean these are dirty it doesn't
really matter at the end of the day but
so right now I'm kind of at this point
where I have these left to go through in
a couple more face brushes then I want
to go through what I think I'm keeping
and I'll scooch them out of this weird
lighting and really be a little bit more
cutthroat with what I'm keeping and
decide from there does that make sense
so like looking at these I've kind of
grouped them by type kind of and I'm
just trying to be like what I'm trying
to do is look at it and say okay what
brushes do I get so excited to have like
in my little like brush Cup I keep some
in my bathroom some in here those in the
white one are the ones I used like
constantly because that's what I have
like where I film and that's usually
where I get ready it's only when I'm in
a hurry that I get ready in my bathroom
so for example like I really like this
brush right here it's the it cosmetics
she guys shadow I when I see it I get
excited to use it so those are the kinds
of brushes I'm wanting to keep what else
do I get excited to use I really like
this flower beauty one so I think I'll
keep that I did not like using I had
this Sedona lace one I'm gonna get rid
of that I did not like using it I and I
can't really explain why I
I love this brush but I don't like that
this is dual ended and it's just like my
own personal thing so I'm gonna get rid
of that I bought like this Mac one but I
never ever reach for it I think I've
just realized I don't like using it so I
think it's just time to get rid of it
makes me sad but I don't ever use it
good job Jess that was hard I kept
eyeing it I'm like no I'm not gonna get
rid of it but I don't like I didn't like
using it same goes for this shape the
Sigma one was okay my Mac 224 I think
I'll keep the Mac and get rid of this
Sigma cuz I liked the Mac one more so
you can see I've already got a pile of
some of these over here and I'll go
through them in a sec I promise so out
of these kind of flatter ones this Mac
one looks crazy look at that it's like
all tattered it's just I'm I'm proud of
myself
this Mac one is fine and I feel like
it's gotten lost in my collection and if
I'd like notice it I would have used it
so I am gonna keep this one and then
we're left with a bunch of these I can
get rid of that one I don't really care
about I think I did like this Sigma one
I think it was good at like placing
shadow and then these three can go I
don't really feel anything about him so
why keep them and I think originally my
concern was like what if I get rid of so
many brushes that I'm like oh no like I
only have one of this kind of brush well
first of all I could just go and buy
some new ones like elf has amazing
especially eye brushes they have amazing
eye brushes some of my favorites and
I'll try to point them out while I'm
filming this so for me I'm like it's not
that big of a deal just get rid of a
bunch of stuff a lot of this stuff I've
had for years and otherwise it's just
I'm drowning and always you know alright
so looking at these I'm just gonna pick
out my favorites I've had this elf one
forever it's just time it
old I never went for this one I did I do
like this one a lot what is it Sedona
lace EB 21 I use that a lot for my lower
lashline keep I think I remembered
really liking this one it's a royal and
langnickel detail brush it says it's
like boem 18 I liked that one and I
think I'm just huh I might keep keep one
like bottom lash kind of shader brush
and I'm just gonna get rid of those oh
good job Jess okay eyebrow brushes let's
see I have barely tried this pretty
vulgar one I know I like my Anasazi one
and I like the elf one I want to have at
least two so I can have them in both
rooms which do I really want to get rid
of maybe I'll just get rid of how the
elf one is really good mmm okay I'm just
not I like them all so I'm just gonna
keep all three it's not that big of a
deal just okay liner brushes I am so
picky about liner brushes like weirdly
picky if it's too thick it doesn't work
the way I need it to this is a brow one
I don't need it so that can go this Mac
one is my absolute favorite the Mac 265
it is time for me to get a new one
though like I've cleaned that it's just
old I'm gonna keep it as a reminder that
I need to buy a new one and then I'll
get rid of this one but it is the best
eyeliner brush I've ever come across and
then what was the other one that I
really liked was that this caridy one I
think it was because it's very very
similar it's Kara de 22 so those can be
my two that means I can get rid of this
one pole this one seems nice - the star
looks I might still get rid of it I love
the sparkly ones but this one's too
thick I don't have any of these flat
liner brushes and when I use shadow I
like to use it this Sigma e 15 so I'm
gonna keep that this is this Kevin a
Kwan one I don't know I don't ever use
it I'm gonna pass it on and then this
pretty vulgar one I might keep just
because I like that it's got both ends I
don't like dual ended but I like
it has both options and then I'm just
gonna get rid of these oh yes this is a
good feeling all right I think I only
need one of these and I think my
favorite is this a cosmetics chic
foundation so those two can go out of
these I really do like it's a short elf
like brush I don't know why but I love
it so that's a key I don't need that
this is an elf one I never use so that
can go too
oh my gosh this is a good feeling
alright um remove these into what I'm
keeping this I mean I think I'm gonna
keep gonna go and put it over there I
have an elf small stipple brush and I
think I am gonna keep it cuz I bought it
intentionally because I love this brush
and I didn't have any more all right so
now sponges oh that goes away now
sponges I know this is gonna grow some
of you out because they're all so dirty
I'm gonna be honest it kind of grosses
me out I need to clean them I can't wait
I did not like this it was an elf purple
brush that's gonna go these are all my
beauty blenders I'm gonna keep these I
just need to clean them this flower
beauty one is like my ultimate favorite
so definitely keeping this L'Oreal ones
another favorite I don't like this
Ecotools one I'm just gonna get rid of
it I don't know why people like it and
it could just be a style thing like this
flower Beauty one is so squishy so some
people don't like that but I do so I
don't know I'm gonna get rid of it this
NYX one I honestly didn't really like
either a lot of people did I need to
keep it for a haul update but once I do
that video it's gonna go and then I've
got like tweezers and scissors these
scissors are pretty old so I think I'm
gonna get rid of those I don't need all
these tweezers you know they these are
the best ones these two so I think these
all can go okay and then this is one
that came with this onna me little thing
and I haven't used it yet so I'm
definitely gonna keep that and I have
more okay this is a Beauty Blender but
it's all messed up and I know it's
shallow but it bothers me so I'm just
gonna get rid of it
no these silicone sponges are the
silliest thing honestly I've started
using these two just like squirt
foundation on I usually squirt it on my
hand but instead I've been squirting it
on this so then I can just rinse it off
honestly that's just an extra step I
don't need to do so it's gonna go this
is like an elf one I didn't like the
Sephora cake and baked I just I don't
like the shape
I get like if you bake but I don't so
for me it's kind of silly so I'm gonna
get rid of it these okay here's the
other Ecotools one I really didn't like
these what were these were these the
ones that came with like I think these
are actual Beauty Blender brand that I
bought so I'm gonna keep these like for
concealer this was the L'Oreal one but
it does not oh no this is another elf
one so that one's gonna go that's right
it's not the L'Oreal the Real Techniques
one I don't I need to try this again
because I do a lot of you guys have said
you feel like they reformulate it and I
have kind of felt the same way but based
on like placing this against like the
one I used to have I wish I still had it
so I'm gonna keep it and try it and then
I think eventually and I think this was
the one these came with Ecotools I don't
know what they came from I think I'm
just gonna get rid of him wow that's
that's pretty good I didn't think I'd
get rid of that many yeah okay
so by the way I keep these in this
student I think last year got me this
it's supposed to be like a little drink
holder but I keep all my sponges in it I
think it's so cute
okay Apple okay so these are all my
dirty ones that I think I'm keeping
those are all my clean ones I think I'm
keeping isn't and saying how many are
dirty right now so but this is kind of
my so far my pile of what I want to keep
it's still too much my idea is that I'd
like to have two of everything like I
said and I've already explained why and
then if there's just like some extra
special brushes then I can maybe keep
those but I just don't need three to
four of every kind of brush okay so
let's pick out my powder brushes and
decide between them what I've used as
powder brushes I guess is how I should
say it are there any up here not really
okay so currently I have three brushes
that I view as powder this was pretty
good but it just wasn't my favorite it's
a Tarte one it's very very stiff so I'm
gonna get rid of it good to powder
brushes not bad so those my final
verdicts will go over here alright let's
do maybe like concealer brushes so I've
got like those two I use to blend in
concealer
I used that sometimes that yeah these
two I do
are there any up here sometimes I use
this right here any other ones I don't
want to forget any like I need to
separate these from those okay I think
that's all that I use for concealers so
looking at these here and they are very
all they're all very different brushes I
will say that these are like the exact
same thing do I need both no but I like
to have the dupe you know because this
really is very very very similar so I
think I'm going to keep both just
because I like to be able to tell you
about the dupe and how it really is good
so I'm gonna keep both of those out of
these I love this brush for concealer
and need to clean it but it's the diva
Beauty so3 I love it so I'm definitely
keeping that and then I don't really
need this one it's a little bit firmer
than I like and it's pretty big so I'm
gonna get rid of that one and then these
I just haven't really gotten to try out
I got sent them through like octal II I
think from the brand for free and I just
haven't gotten to try them out as much
as I'd like to and what I have used I've
really liked it so I'm gonna keep trying
them and then maybe you decide um so I
didn't get rid of a ton of those but
it's kind of a special case scenario
alright let's do what I use to set my
under eye powder I use this one of those
this that's more highlight this I use
that I know I don't really use that one
for that I think that might be it so for
setting under I've I love these two and
I I love all three I really do I use all
three of them all the time all three of
these are dirty because I used them so I
think I'm gonna keep them all not
following my own advice
okay so concealers done let's do well
you know what we didn't even do
foundation so let's pull all the brushes
I like to use for Foundation and try to
keep the clean ones separate this is
getting more and more difficult to do I
should have just washed them all
oh this is a powder bro no I use this
for bronzer sorry I struggle with this
cuz I do kind of use different things
use that for bronzer I don't actually
use that for foundation so I don't want
to pull that with this oh do I use this
one yeah I do alright so for foundation
I got all of these this one is like a
weird brush but I like fell in love with
it and I can't explain why but I really
do it's the it cosmetics angled radiance
and it's totally not a foundation brush
but I use it all the time for that this
one I love too but it's really old so I
think I'm just gonna pass it on from it
cosmetics this one is like the brush you
have to use with the hourglass vanish
sticks so I'm definitely keeping that I
love my artiste one and I love my leg or
one so those I'm keeping then I've got
these two I don't know I feel like I
don't use either one of these very often
I like this Real Techniques one I don't
know I loved these though maybe I'll
keep this Sedona lace thing get rid of
the Real Techniques one so there we go
not great but whatever is this artiste
one dirty I don't know I'll sort through
those after I'm done alright so let's
talk bronzer what do I use for bronzer
you use a lot of these umm this one I
might use for bronzer that's all I blush
okay oh I use this one sometimes for
bronzer so I clearly like different
things for bronzer like I use all kinds
of different things I do want to keep
this because I think it is great for you
know what let's just pull this one into
it too and where's my my ELF small
stipple so maybe I can get rid of this
small elf one goodbye so I have two of
the stipple kind like if I'm using a
cream bronzer and like that and then I
really like these two for bronzer and I
like all four of these this one I think
I can maybe pass on I don't need it all
but out of these four like I've been
using this one lately and I really
like how tapir or how how its shaped and
then I like these two as well I think
I'm gonna keep all of these I really
really I like all of them
alright blush let's do it blush I think
I use all of those that's more highlight
okay so blush wise this is my favorite
this is a close second
this is like this Sedona lace duo-fiber
this is the it cosmetics I don't know
what it is but it's the best blush
Project ever owned I don't really need
do I feel like I have used this though
these are all very different but I like
them all again I'm just gonna keep it's
not too bad though I mean considering
what I do I guess it's not that big of a
deal to own more than one you know
alright so highlight brushes I love this
elf highlighting brush of course I move
these and now that Sun is over there let
me switch okay these are like basically
the exact same product this Sephora and
the Sigma but I really really like them
this is a little bit too wobbly I think
I like it though I like all of these yet
again here we are I think I might keep
them all because I like switching them
out and I love the shape of all of these
and then I like having one fan brush I'm
just gonna keep them this I use
sometimes just for like primer and I
only have one and I'm fine with that I
got rid of like three or four so alright
so now on to eye brushes these are the
only clean ones of course okay so I've
got these kind of sorted into categories
here so I've got my two like really thin
liner brushes but I also have this dual
ended one and I just don't use these
often enough so I think I am gonna get
rid of this dual ended one from pretty
vulgar even though it was pretty good
and I think I'm going to just keep one
of these I think I'm gonna keep the elf
one I think it's pretty good and I just
don't use it enough to keep both so then
I've got this really bizarre our teeth
one that I do you
it's interesting to use I like to use it
with powder more than anything and then
these two that I already showed you so
those are gonna be my liner brushes that
I keep I don't think that's too bad all
right so these I consider small fluffy
brushes I have like my bigger ones and
then these are the ones I have to have
every day for like my outer corner
crease my favorite is this elf crease
brush it is the best crease brush I've
ever used ever I mean it really is the
best I love this thick cosmetics one as
well and then what is this brand this is
like such a random one but I use it all
the time all of these so I think I'm
gonna keep all for it because I do I
mean this is an everyday staple for me
when I'm doing my shadow every single
day same with these I love this Sigma
when I've had forever this Mac one I've
had Mac 224 I've had forever and this
Sephora when I really like to what is
this one this morphe when i don't like
as much so I'm gonna pass that one on
alright these are more like shader
brushes kind of this is one of my
favorites again it's an it cosmetics one
their stunning eye shadow I love how
glittery those aren't so fun Marc Jacobs
one I think I'm gonna keep just cuz
they're still new to me and I want to
keep trying them out I think I did like
this Sigma one and I'll keep this Mac
one and I'll past these two on good job
Jess I didn't think I'd get rid of more
I'm proud he got to encourage yourself
along the way cuz it's hard also have I
shown you guys my coffee mug I'm filming
this I don't know when this will go up
probably in October I'm filming it in
October and this mug is everything isn't
it awesome oh my gosh alright so now
I've got kind of smudge type brushes
some of them are more like liner this is
the only like smudger like with a foam
kind of a thing like spongy from elf so
I'm gonna keep that it's actually pretty
good I'm gonna keep this Marc Jacobs one
and this Sedona lace one I really really
like I think I'm gonna pass this royal
and langnickel one on I might keep the
Sigma one and you know what I don't
really need that I'm gonna pass it on to
oh my gosh I'm so proud
okay oh I passed you on little one
alright out of these my favorites I use
these for my under my brow bone I love
this elf one and I love is that cosmetic
so I'm gonna pass on the Sigma one
that's secondly a concealer brush anyway
but whatever and then I'm down to these
brow ones I just don't need all three
maybe I'll the reason I like to keep the
elf one is because it's really good and
again it's an affordable brush option
for you
this anasazi one is great it just is and
the spoolie is the best and then this
pretty vulgar one is really good too I'm
just gonna keep them on okay so I am
officially down to what I am keeping
here which I'm sure to many of you looks
like a lot but to me like I just left
the room and I came back in and saw the
pilot I'm like this is awesomely
curated to me it's awesomely curated and
then there's this huge I mean if I
really spread all this out is huge pile
of brushes that you know I just wasn't
using at all and some of them I like
would force myself to use so I'd wait
longer to clean my brushes so I'd use
them I'm like this is dumb life is too
short
use the brushes you love and just get
rid of the ones you don't and on the
plus side I have a bunch of brushes that
now I don't have to clean because I'm
getting rid of them I let my sister's go
through them and I always tell them like
hey if it's dirty you might want to put
this good lucks yes
but yeah so this this feels good cuz
this was like weirdly a part of my
collection that was starting to feel
overwhelming I'm excited to clean those
up again like this and this will
probably be gone sorry it's hard to see
what the Sun these two will probably be
gone once I film about this one and try
this one again so that's also a good
feeling and you know what I might even
over time some of these Beauty blenders
they're they're getting pretty old you
know what maybe I will just get maybe
keep one of them that's newer maybe oh
it's just time to get rid of these whoa
sorry I forgot I was oom din so I think
I'm gonna get rid of these two old ones
maybe invest in a new one or two because
the reality is these are really good but
I love my flower in my L'Oreal one so I
don't feel like I need them
these are just getting real gross so
it's just time good job Jess also so I
used to have this side of my closet like
filled with bags of bags for like travel
I'm now down to this one bag and it has
makeup bags my travel pillow travel hair
dryer you know a book bag little like
electronic things for travel and I got
rid of all of this look at all of these
bags of backs like literally let me set
my coffee down this one is a bag of just
makeup bags and all these stuff that I
was keeping use a month oh it's Ted
Baker oh like it's an expensive
brilliant well I'm not using it I have
like this really nice book bag that I
use in college I don't use it anymore
I'm like well just in case I don't need
it all of these bags I mean it was just
time and I'm sorry that I didn't film it
cuz it was just one of those things that
I was in the moment and I just needed to
do it last night but I feel so proud
it's just a good feeling and then I put
all of the makeup brushes and things in
here that I'm getting rid of so it is
like literally it's the four bag full
heavy of brushes that's awesome
overall I feel really good about where I
am in this process I'm kind of in there
oh my gosh I'm kind of in the right
mindset I think and you really do need
to get yourself in that mindset my
husband's currently reading finally got
him to read it he's reading The Perks
what am I talking about not the Perks of
Being a Wallflower
here's remember that book what am the
life-changing magic of tidying up I was
gonna say the perks of tidying up I love
that book I'll link it below if you've
never read it but I've done lots of
Marie Kondo style on video as well I did
like a clothing one the rest of them I
guess aren't really her style but just
with her mindset like you know if you
don't get like a surge of joy when you
see it then don't keep it there's no
point like anyway so it's a really good
feeling but you do have to be in the
right mindset I can link some of my most
popular declutter videos I've been doing
declutter makeup videos for ever and I
usually am pretty cutthroat but I've
also done some like decluttering tips
kind of videos which I can link below
because I do think it's helpful to watch
to clutter videos and tip videos before
you start so that your mind is thinking
clearly and your your you're reminding
yourself of those different menthe
does that help you actually get rid of
things so anyway my husband's reading
that book so he's in this mindset and
you know like thinking of like my purses
and clothes and shoes we just moved into
a new house this past summer so you know
we moved a lot of stuff and realized
like why do we why do we have this you
know what I mean so it's awesome that
we're both kind of thinking the same way
so I hope you enjoyed if you did please
give it a thumbs up definitely subscribe
check out my other declutter videos if
you are in that kind of a mood and I'll
see you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
