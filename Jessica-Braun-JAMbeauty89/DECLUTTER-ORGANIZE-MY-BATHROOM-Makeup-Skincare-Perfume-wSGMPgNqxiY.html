overcoming a little bit of a sickness I
think anyway so today we're gonna
declutter my bathroom so I've got this
main drawer here I've got some perfume
back there I want to go through a couple
of other drawers I've got skincare and
here I'm just some things that either I
have tried for a while and I'm like okay
I think I don't like them I want to get
rid of them or they're just things that
have frankly some of the makeup items in
there have been in there for a while and
I literally forgot I even owned them I
don't care about them so I need to get
rid of those as well so let's go ahead
and start to declutter so let's start
with my perfume collection I recently
added a couple new perfumes to my
collection I haven't mentioned them yet
on my channel and I've been wearing them
for a few weeks and I kind of know how I
feel about them as well I got my new
perfumes from fragrance calm and this
video is actually sponsored by them and
I'm excited cuz they offer a 30% off
code which is JB 30 and it's good till
Mother's Day May 13th of this year and
30% off is crazy because if your perfume
you're buying is like a hundred dollars
that's $30 off so the reason I like
fragrance calm and why I like to buy
perfumes from there because I have
bought from them in the past just on my
own is because it's just cheaper for
example like Gucci Guilty here this for
the this is actually a 2.5 fluid ounce
but I just remember that the one fluid
ounce was $50 on their website and on
Sephora
it was 65 and they're both exactly the
same and packaging I mean they're
authentic nothing weird or fishy going
on and so that alone is crazy but this
one for example I got in a with no
packaging meaning it just came in a
plain white box and it was so much
cheaper and on Sephora it's way more
than that I don't know the price but
I'll put it on the screen so you save a
ton of money by getting it just with no
packaging if they offer that for the
perfume you want I would throw that box
away I already have so for me I don't
keep the perfume boxes so it doesn't
matter to me when there's literally it's
all brand new so
it's just a box okay so definitely check
them out I will put the link to the
website and the coupon code down below
if you're interested in purchasing your
next perfume from them or maybe buying a
gift for a mother in your life but the
ones I recently got was Gucci Guilty so
this is a very new one this is a very
popular perfume and it's kind of sweet
but kind of spicy too and it's very I
don't know it's kind of different for me
and I like it and then this one is the
misty or just like this one that I
already love but this one's the Eau de
Toilette so I really like that it's just
a little bit lighter in a way which is
kind of nice and the spray I think this
is a really nice one for me this is the
YSL I think it's called mall Perry and I
love this one this black opium one is
more of a kind of fall and wintertime
one for me also from YSL I'm about
halfway through with it but it's
definitely a heavier scent so I don't
like right now I'm not really reaching
for it a ton this one's another when I
got on fragrance calm and it's one of my
absolute favorites this is the Lancome
la vie a Belle and I freaking it's very
very sweet but I love it and then nest
indigo is another one I really like
again kind of a deeper scent but I've
never smelled anything like this it's
one of my favorites this however I think
I'm gonna do clutter this is Versace
bright crystal I think I've had it for
just a little bit too long and it's
starting to smell a little off I'm gonna
definitely pass this one on but all of
the rest
I really do use and of course some of
them are newer to me so those I'm gonna
leave alone so we're gonna go in this
top drawer here this is where I have
makeup some prenatal things
you know cotton round some skincare so
let's declutter this these many doctor
has me taking tums or calcium and some
vitamin D this is a prenatal I don't
really like it to be honest with you
I've ordered a totally different brand
and these are also prenatal vitamins I
have that I take in every other day with
these because they have a lot more to
them anyway so those have to stay but
this thank goodness is almost
and I'm excited to try the new kind I
got I can link to the new one that I
thought that has way better reviews down
below I've bought it on Amazon these I
just recently purchased it's that
Shiseido facial Cotton's I'm
repurchasing from Sephora so those
always live there usually they you know
fill up that entire space they're just
so soft and they don't soak up so much
of the liquid if you're using it for
essence love it
okay like for example I never use this I
always keep it some like oh oh use it
but I never do so I feel like I should
get rid of this clip I've had it forever
so I think I'm gonna pass that on / I
don't know see if a sister wants it
released these oh this is a suction cup
for our squeegee and our thing so that
needs to go in our shower this I use
every day for my contact solution
I do actually use these from time to
time only when it's a mask that's really
kind of thick and hard to spread and
then this just helps get it off but it's
not like I don't like to use like my
Clarisonic to get my mask off so with
this I feel like oh it's not too
expensive so if it stains that I'm not
too worried about it although really it
never stands it I've got some contact
drops some glass cleaning cloths I use
those this these I literally I don't
even know why I own these I really don't
I think I might take like one silver one
off because I could see myself using
that to kind of have my hair some up and
some down and maybe one of the gold ones
and then I think everything else the
rest of it I'm gonna see if a sister
wants or a friend cuz they're literally
I don't even know why I bought these so
keep those past these on bobby pins
obviously I will use those so looking
back here like again I have why did I
buy this it's a little barrette I've
never used it back
go the rest of these I've got these
really fun like hair ties I can link
these below they're great because they
don't give creases in your hair if
you're worried about that I have really
textured natural hair so I don't worry
so much about creasing cuz usually my
hair was either curly or wavy but yeah
this is a broad I do use from time to
time some of these I used to hold hair
back so I think for the most part the
rest of these I want a key yeah because
like this is a cute hair thing I have
used before a couple of times but I used
to have like bags of hair things and
this is like literally all I have left
that and my bobby pins so I don't feel
too badly about that
that's very whittled down already
looking at this makeup this is where I'm
like okay it's time like this I want
candy under I kind of powder from Too
Faced no I didn't like it I don't know
why I was putting products in here like
oh I need to do makeup in here well I
really don't do that very often I like
to keep some of you because I do for I
did the other day for example but this I
don't like I can go the bye bye redness
is pretty good so I will keep that in
here I can't go there the city color be
matte blush is so pretty it's in the
shade blackberry it's so pigmented it's
like the prettiest color definitely
keeping that the contact thing can go
over here by these oh mama mama bronzer
I just don't care for I mean I don't
think it's bad at all I just never use
it and even when I get ready in here I
don't use it so I'm just gonna pass it
on tartlet and bloom is really nice and
it's funny when I did my palette
declutter a lot of you guys were like um
where's your chocolate and bloom totally
forgot it was in here this is the
perfect palette to have in here because
while I really do like it it's not like
a palette I'm dying to use everyday but
it's really good and I can do any
everyday look I need and that I think is
the perfect palette to have in here
because it's kind of it includes every
shade I would need so I don't need any
extra shadows or anything like that this
primer is old of old it was fine it was
a Hydra
primer I don't think it's any more
special than like the NYX hydrating
primer but it's also really cold so I'm
going to throw that away this is old -
it was almost gone but this nine months
I've definitely had it longer than that
it was almost used up though I really
really like this Kota Li vino source
it's a really nice moisturizer for under
makeup and that's why I used it so much
because it's not too greasy but it's
still moisturizes so I highly recommend
but I need to throw it away um this SPS
honestly how long have I had this I need
to look into like in my past videos it
might be time to toss this because I've
had this for a while too it's the super
goop mineral sunscreen SPF 40 I only
used it a couple of times and I don't
think this is cheap I'm sure they sent
this to me long ago but with SPF I don't
like to mess around like if it's expired
I don't want to use it and then my skin
react poorly or get burnt because it's
not working you know so I'm gonna look
into that but I'm probably going to
throw that away
this volition setting spray it's there
mattifying miss I actually do like and
it's fine so I'm gonna keep that I've
got a couple of lip glosses here this is
the buxom lip gloss and dolly these are
like plumping I guess I can swatch these
huh it's a little bit deeper but again
it's so sheer that it looks it looks
nice so I'm gonna keep that one this one
I really liked it's in the shade
sweetheart it's one of the NYX mega
shines but you guys were so I wore it in
the video alone and you guys were like
Jessica that looks terrible on your lips
and like I feel like in person it looked
maybe better but now I'm in my head
about it I'm like well I don't want to
wear it out anymore so I'm gonna I don't
know just get rid of this one I think
it's just a little too Matata I really
liked it though but I have really like
my lips have like really I don't know
deep lines in them so I think that's
part of why it didn't look as good on me
so if you've really plump youthful lips
you might like it
this Sephora gloss was nice
just don't need it honestly I have so
many glosses like this even after the
cluttering I don't need it I'm sure my
sister will use that one
this Marc Jacobs eye primer I was not a
big fan of but I used it again the other
day and I was like actually it's okay I
what I didn't like about it is that
it'll like on the outside of your eyes
where you the primer ends sometimes you
can see where that line is and it's
really weird
but I use it the other day and it was
okay and I thought you know what to have
in here to try to use up a little bit
more before it goes bad I'm gonna try to
use up some more that this Naked skin
concealer I don't know if it went bad
but the color is a little too orange a
yellow for me maybe it was always that
way it's light warm the sheet is light
warm so I don't know it's just not the
right shade so that one I might see if a
sister wants but I might just throw away
cuz I have had it for a little while
this is almost gone this coat Aleve you
know perfect serum but well it's
probably like halfway gone I really like
this year I'm gonna put this in my
travel tour though different area I'm
even see if this Kat Von D tattoo liner
is any good yeah it's kind of like
watery and not as black so that it's
time to go this the paul mad lash has
been in here for a while I think it's
time for that one's a go this liner
should be fine this is the pixie i
define waterline they make really great
liners yeah that one's great so keeping
that one hourglass arch brow pencil I
really like there's just a little bit
left but I will use that up so keep this
pretty vulgar cream liner
yeah it looks just fine in there I liked
this I think it's a little overpriced
because I don't think it's any better
than like the Maybelline or the L'Oreal
gel liners they sell at the drugstore
but it is good so I'll so use it and
there's nothing wrong with it yet I
makeup remover pen this one's pretty old
I'm gonna toss this is this Knightley
lip
see I forgot I even comb this from
Dermalogica I remember really liking it
so I'm gonna keep it and maybe actually
use it this is the glossy a halo scope
in the shade quartz it's nice it really
does do a good job like when I use like
a beauty sponge with this and tap it
onto the top of my cheekbones it
actually does look really nice so I
think I want to keep that so let me read
or ghen eyes
those are we organized I do want to fill
in the gaps from my regular collection
with like you know pull over a mascara
I'll probably bring my NYX worth the
hype mascara because I think it's good
but it's not my favorite so I think I
might bring that over here because I
know I wouldn't hate using it but I'm
not gonna miss having it like in my main
collection for the next month or two I
need so I need that I might want to
bring a bronzer over here in a
foundation but other than that I mean oh
and a concealer probably so over here
I've got some skincare these are these
Sephora sleeping masks I definitely want
to use this is the Lotus one which is
moisturizing and soothing and then this
is the green tea which is mattifying I
bought these just to try and I really
liked them this is I don't even remember
where I got it I think a brand send it
to me or no I think I ordered it on
HauteLook it's too big like it's
literally too big on my head so I think
I'm gonna pass this on q-tips I
definitely use this is so old it's the
karez Greek Greek yogurt advanced
nourishing sleeping facial I love this
you put it on and just sleep with it on
and it just sinks into your skin but
it's starting to smell a little bit odd
and this was I think the second one of
these I had I really liked it but it is
time to go this moisturizing moon mask
it was actually pretty good but again
what is the date yet Oh 24 months
actually that might be okay I might try
to use this up in the next maybe two
more times I could probably use that up
I mean if I put a ton on I don't want it
to go bad cuz it was good so I'm gonna
keep it with the idea that I'm gonna use
it up would I repurchase I mean it's
nothing crazy compared to other ones so
I don't think it's like anything you
need to spend the money on these are
these petrology
I chose my husband and I both use these
you just put them on under your eyes and
leave them on for awhile so definitely
gonna move those up as well I got rid of
all of this here some of it will go to
sisters some of it will go straight to
the trash and then I have the perfumes
and hair stuff
on the other side there let's keep going
alrighty so in here I just got this
little like it almost looks like a spice
rack at me well oh jeez but it's a
thinner this way so it's not as wide and
it's so perfect for holding skincare you
can still see it all so if you have
anything like this and you need kind of
a storage solution it really is nice the
only thing is when you have thin ones
like this I need to like find another
spot for so let's go through this stuff
now keep in mind these are products that
I have open I have a ton of skincare on
back up or I just have some skincare
just in my makeup collection because I
use more during the day but this is
typically stuff I use at night and some
of it like I haven't actually opened
this and I can't really use it while I'm
pregnant this is the Sunday Riley Luna
so I'm gonna move this to my serums
drawer that I have in my closet of
unopened skincare because I just can't
use it right now and I'm excited to use
it but I need to wait so that is just
gonna be moved um this is the cleansing
oil I'm using to remove makeup right now
it's the tatcha camellia cleansing oil
it's almost gone it's probably to here I
already have another one I really like
this when I first used it I thought it
was breaking me out so I literally took
it out of here for a while and I used
some other stuff and then I just pulled
it back out maybe a month ago and I
realize it was not this it was it must
have been something else cuz I've been
I've been using it for a few weeks and
nothing weird has happened so although I
do have a broken breakout on my chin but
that is a hormonal pregnancy breakout
trust me
so anyway gotta keep this almost done
with that this Sunday Riley just
recently sent to me and I was freaking
losing it really this and the Luna and
the title so these two I've been using
lately this is their enzyme water cream
moisturizer I like to use at night and
then this is their it's a calyx folio
it's a lactic acid treatment and it
makes my skin so bright and so glowy I
freaking love it but it's so expensive
this is another cleansing balm I'm still
using from L'Occitane it's almost gone I
love this line I've used up most of it
is I think the last product I have left
but and I'm so mad at myself because
most of it I just filmed an empties
video and I forgot to put these in there
and I'm so mad stuff because I finish a
bunch up at the same time anyway but
this one's almost continence their
makeup removing bomb and it is nice it
definitely has a fragrance to it so if
that bothers you you will not like this
but it does this is this origins plant
scription serum that I'm using I'm
probably I don't know I've used up that
much because it's going up I like what I
go and repurchase I don't know because
I'm not noticing a huge difference in my
skin this is my husband's stuff by the
way over here this is this grande lash
serum what I noticed is it does make my
lashes longer it really does but I
forget to use it you've got to use it
like all the time so it's in here I want
to use it up but the problem is even if
my lashes grow like they will stop the
second I stopped using this so I don't
know wonder how that I don't really like
this is from chunk elephants there's
Saba complex I serum I don't know why
but I don't think this works and I've
been using it for quite a while they
sent me another one and my husband's
using it and he's like guy and I'm like
I feel the same way it's just gone yeah
and I know that drunk elephant always
says you've got to use all of their
products together and I get it I guess
but at the same time I'm like but it
still should be able to do something on
its own because not everyone can afford
every product from drunk alpha I mean
that's it they're so expensive
so I like a lot of drunk elephant
products this is not one of them so I'm
gonna use it up it's almost gone and
then no I would not buy this is one I do
like though they're marula oil I used
this a couple times a week just as an
added layer of moisture on my skin
before going to bed if you use a little
bit it's not as greasy as you'd think
but I always end up using too much and
then it's really greasy but I'm like
that whatever I'm going to bed anyway so
I just really like I always wake up the
next morning with a really hydrated skin
these two are the two like toner slash
essences
I'm using I like to use the Kota Lemoore
in the morning so like after I shower
I'll just use a cotton pad to wipe this
this is the Vino perfect essence I feel
like it's just kind of preps my skin for
what I'm going to put on it and it's
it's nothing too strong it's it's nice
but again this is expensive and then
this fresh rose hydrating toner this I
used at night it definitely is a strong
scent has little rose petals in there
but I just really like it my skin seems
to like it
again it preps my pores and my skin for
everything else I'm gonna put on like
serums and stuff helps it absorb it a
little bit better so I just like this I
could see myself buying this again and
frankly I feel like I've been using this
forever and it's not going anywhere
this is one the polished choice resist
treatment this is a another chemical
exfoliant similar to the good Jean good
jeans because it has lactic acid but it
also has glycolic and malic acids so it
has a lot going for it but I feel like
right now it's almost a little strong
for my skin good jeans is strong too but
I feel like I don't need both going in
my collection so I think I might put
this away for now and pull it back out
once I'm done with it good jeans because
it's good for 12 months I'll definitely
be ready I only open this like a month
ago so after I'm through the good jeans
I'll pull this sucker back out and be
able to use it up before it goes bad
products I can't live without my nose
lips sleeping mask that's all my lips
right now I wear all day long all night
long it's like all I wear on my lips
anymore
it looks so it's like this light pink
you know kind of sheer lip product but
it smells amazing it feels amazing my
lips are so healthy and yes will
repurchase freaking adore this stuff
this I wanna buy a full-size of this is
a sample of the Laneige water sleeping
mask it's almost gone I probably like
one more use you put it on and just
leave it on if you want and it's just
really moisturizing overnight this
hyaluronic acid I think I need to get
rid of I've had it open for longer than
12
so I really really like it I could see
myself buying this again because this is
so inexpensive and my skin loves
hyaluronic acid it just adds a really
good hydration really simple hydration
and I really like that but I need to
throw it out this Origins salicylic acid
I can put away right now I can't use
it's good you put it on on pimples and
it can kind of dry it out but I think
salicylic acid is one of the ones that I
shouldn't be using while I'm not the
Guru when it comes to that I know what I
know and I'm trying to learn Oh
this was one I thought was working it's
the Boatshed exfoliating peel joke cuz I
would put it on like oh my gosh she can
feel the dead skin coming off and you
guys were like uh no Jessica that's not
dead skin and I'm like Eeyore right I
tried it a bunch of different ways I'm
like yeah it always pills up even on
your fingertips where there really is no
dry skin it would do the same thing I'm
like okay so kind of gimmicky don't I
don't need it anymore I'm gonna pass it
on / maybe throw away this drying lotion
again it's kind of like alcohol in it
and a lot of other stuff so I don't like
to use it right now I know my husband
uses it from time to time so I might
kind of move it to his side Kiehl's
midnight recovery I a nice eye cream I
still not found like this is one of my
favorites I've ever found however I
still feel like I'm on the hunt for like
the best eye cream ever so if you have
any recommendations please let me know
because I do really like this stuff I
have repurchased it more than once but
again I feel like I just haven't found
that Holy Grail one ski the Navy a post
makeup recovery spray I'm just trying to
use up its kind of a toner
you know there's witch hazel in it and a
couple other things I don't think
there's anything wrong with it I think
it's good but again I've got so many
toners and essences I want to try and I
think this is just kind of standard so
it's okay
a contact solution case oh this is a
weird product this is the touch of
gentle rice enzyme powder it's literally
a powder I'm actually using this as my
cleanser right now so what I do is I
dump a little bit of the powder into my
hand and I get like the tiniest bit of
water and lather it up and then I just
rub it on my skin gently this stuff is
amazing my skin feels so clean but but
hydrated still it's
sucking the life out of it and it's so
cool so I'm almost out of it I could see
myself eyeing this again but at the same
time again I have so many cleansers I'm
back up but I this I really did like
amazing moisturizer belief the true
cream moisturizing balm so hydrating
getting near the bottom now I have the
aqua version but I just learned that
that's the one that's not quite as
hydrating so now I'm like dang it so
this is the one I like it's so good I'm
flying through it but it's one of the
best moisturizers I've ever tried and
then this is the AL Genest power serum
holy crap it's a serum that's in like a
you know kind of a cream now I know a
lot of people don't like jar packaging
I'm trying to power through it so it
doesn't completely affect all of the
ingredients in it because your packaging
is not the best for skincare it's just
not but this stuff is freaking amazing
my skin loves it I feel like it drinks
it right out and I just I love the way
my skin reacts to it so then I've got my
Clarisonic Mia I freaking love it's
probably about time to replace my head
there but I have my little hold where he
told you guys I've got my holder I love
it and then I also have this I've been
using a ton lately from PMD it's a
vibrating cleanser the reason I haven't
changed my Clarisonic is because I've
been using this the past like month and
a half and I actually really like it and
you don't have to clean the head I mean
you clean it but you don't need to
replace the head ok I need to do a
review on some PMD products I've been
trying out for a while
soon but this is one I feel loving so
that is everything we were gonna clean
out of there I can rearrange a bit
so this is my haircare drawer this will
be pretty quick because I'm pretty much
using everything in here I don't really
keep a lot in here that are not most of
these are almost gone like this brioche
you know curled is almost gone
I just recently picked up the volumizing
tonic from Aveda and I'm really liking
it though dry shampoos I've got two of
them in here I'm gonna put this one away
honestly I have been really enjoying
this
oh gx1 and I don't like a lot of OGX
products but that one I've been liking
so let's see see I've got like a perfume
sample in here what is this Atelier I
don't need that I didn't even know
wasn't there this is one of my favorites
from nooks I was talking about recently
in my haircare video this oil from
L'Oreal is pretty darn good I put in wet
hair keeping that then I've got this
David curl buildup Buster this would
need to go in my shower so I'm gonna put
that in my shower is braids aid I do use
from time to time
curling lotion that's pretty much it
curly mousse and hairspray so I'm gonna
put this away and put this in my shower
I'm not really getting rid of much but
these are all products I'm using very
exciting drawer my toothpaste toothbrush
bio oil my oil from L'Occitane I use
deodorant for Schmidt's dry brush two
different creams i oh no this keeps
getting stuff back here I always try to
reach for it I can't get it and then my
two created the new thing on my tummy
because I am over 8 months pregnant now
so not an exciting drawer but these are
all things I use all the time so I'm not
getting rid of any of that so I don't
think this was the biggest declutter
I've ever done but I feel like I
recently declared this room and I was
still able to pull all of these things
out things that have gone bad things I
don't like things I'm just not using
that I want to pass on and then these
are products that just need to go
elsewhere you know this little group so
I feel good even though like I said it
wasn't a huge purge it's still a good
feeling to weed out those things that
are just sitting there and every time
you open the door you kind of
see this like especially the makeup I
see this group of things and I'm like I
don't even use this like some of its old
so now I feel like when I open the
drawer everything in there is fresh it's
fine to use it's being used that's a
good feeling so I have other drawers
we're not going to go through today it's
got a lot of just stuff that really I
recently went and organized under there
like these can't trade a point these two
right there
I just recently organized so there's
literally I kind of glanced someone
there's literally nothing to get rid of
in here so I'm feeling pretty good about
that now I need to convince Tyler to go
through his stuff he actually is really
good though about like he's really I'm
just gonna show you this one's actually
really organized like he's even got a
little cup I love him he's so cute
anyway so so he doesn't have a lot that
he is going to be getting rid of I'm
sure but if you're interested in
fragrance calm I will again leave the
link for down below and the 30% off code
which is JB 30 if you're interested in
purchasing some perfume I'm telling you
it's just so much cheaper and it's the
same thing so if you already know a
perfume you want it's probably on there
it's all authentic and it's just cheaper
and especially if you can find one
that's not in the box because it's like
way cheaper anyway so other than that I
will see you guys in my next video and
if you want to watch more of my
declutter I will link my declutter you
playlist down below and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
