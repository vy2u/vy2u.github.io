well hello guys so today's videos gonna
be kind of vlog style I'm looking at my
closet right now in my office and I just
need to clean it out it's needed to be
organized for quite a while and you know
I'm wanting to declutter a bit today but
I'm also wanting to just mostly organize
so it'll be a mixture of both
probably more organization than
declutter but I know I like watching
these kinds of videos just because it
kind of inspires me to go through and
organize declutter you pick up a few
tips here and there and I'm also gonna
be unboxing that little box right there
a bunch of clothes I just picked out
from thread up for I'm pretty cheap so
I'm excited to share those with you as
well so let's get to organizing and
decluttering my life okay so I just got
a another thredUP package I'm a little
obsessed his videos actually sponsored
by thredUP I've worked with them for
months and months I love buying clothes
through them because it's all gently
used like new clothing and for me like
right now my size is changing because
I'm pregnant and so I'm wearing lots of
sweaters but also I just like switching
out my wardrobe and I love that it kind
of breathes new life into clothes so I
have a 40% off code that they gave me I
will put below and on the screen right
now so if you're interested in trying
this out you can search the website
through your size or like what you're
really looking for and I think that's so
cool and every time I go on there like
once a month I see all kinds of new
stuff so anyway so I am excited to see
well I'm excited to show you guys what I
picked out this time they have the
cutest polka dot packaging oh my gosh
this I am really excited about right
here on top this really cute cardigan
because I love cardigans because they're
forgiving you can wear them if you've
gained weight whether you're just
gaining weight or losing weight this is
so wonderful because you can just leave
it unbuttoned and just have like a flowy
top underneath or you could have a
fitted top underneath but this is so
pretty so the brand is j.crew which in
my opinion is very expensive but of
course it's so much cheaper on thredUP
because it's like new clothing so really
excited about this I think it is so
pretty and just kind of different let's
go here
oh yes so this is a like dress actually
but I'm planning on wearing it more like
a tunic with leggings and of course in
the winter a sweater so the brand is Jap
na and I just love this color this is
one of those colors I love wearing and I
feel like I get a lot of compliments
when I wear this color and I just love
that it's loose and flowy feels really
well-made another thing this workout top
so I'm wanting to get more into like
prenatal yoga and things like that and I
need a little bit bigger of a top so
this is the brand Lucy and so it's a
little bit of a bigger size than what I
currently own and it's got kind of a
built in piece up here which I really
like and I've been in the store Lucy and
they had a lot of cute stuff but I've
never bought anything there so I'm
excited to own something from that brand
another thing is this really cute
sweater the brand is Lauren Conrad which
I always you can search by brand as well
and I literally always search Lauren
Conrad first again just a flowy top the
sleeves are so cute they kind of bail
out about halfway down and I thought
that was so pretty again really a loose
shirt so it'll work it might be a little
short for leggings we'll see I'm not
sure but oh my gosh I thought this was
so pretty um so this sweater I loved the
color there's little bits of like
glitter threading throughout as well the
brand is Sociology and it's just kind of
an open little sweater it feels so nice
it looks like it's in perfect condition
oh this color again I just love this
kind of I guess this is more this is
more like a pink color the brand is
Jessica but it just looked like a really
pretty reddish pink cardigan again I my
goal is to have like cardigans in every
single color I have like white black
gray green right now this will make pink
I think I've got a blue one and then I
also got this like kind of dress again
I'm gonna wear it tunic style it's from
the brand body central and I'm planning
on wearing like maybe a blazer with this
I thought that'd be cute like a gray
blazer I don't know a white cardigan I
think would be cute and just wear it
with leggings cuz it would be a little
too short otherwise but feels really
really soft this I couldn't believe was
on there what was the brand I'll put it
on the screen because I don't see the
tag but
I loved it was a really nice brand from
what I remember and I loved that it's
got this cute little tie up here it's
super fashionable right now but again
it's just kind of a loose sweater really
nice and thick and well made so I was so
pumped about that I also got this
infinity scarf this is the softest thing
oh my gosh because you can't tell how
soft it is when you're looking at online
just a simple infinity scarf I've really
gotten away from those big body scarves
right now just because I don't know how
to wear them they're they're
overwhelming to me but these are just so
perfect I can throw it on wrap it one
more time and it's super warm and this
feels so soft and then I got this from
Nautica this is the first thing I've
ever purchased from the brand Nautica
it's just a sweater but it has this
little clasp here in the middle and I
just thought it looked so pretty again
it's a longer one so it worked great
with leggings and a longer shirt as well
and I love navy blue let's open these so
again they wrap you so nicely oh oh yes
maternity tights these were brand new
though and I feel like I can never have
enough so I am really pumped about these
so I got this little necklace was on
there and they package it so nicely in
that box so it's protected I just
thought that was pretty and then I also
got this necklace which I just again
thought was so pretty it's just got this
really pretty kind of rose gold jewel
tone and you can wear it tight or loose
on your neck but I just thought that was
gorgeous so that was cool so that was
everything in my box this time around
that I picked out definitely check it
out to use my 40% off coat if you do I
know a lot of you guys have purchased
from there and you've really had a good
experience whether you buy a couple
things even some of my family members
have gotten on board because I talk
about it so much because almost I feel
like 50% of my closet now is from
thredUP it's so it's all just you know
consignment or like new clothes so
that's awesome so definitely definitely
check it out and thank you throw it up
for sponsoring this video okay so I have
got stuff everywhere I just pulled it
out of the closet now I've had these for
a little while and that's where I
organize excess skin care cuz I don't
need you know if I'm not using it it's
not open I like to keep it kind of out
of the light I can shut the closet doors
but also you know I
just don't have room in here now the
other thing I wanted to clutter and
organize I've got some hair products
down in these bottom like three or four
drawers that again they're unopened ones
they don't need to be there they should
probably be in drawers like this and
I've got like random empty boxes from
like phones and stuff I'm like why am i
keeping the boxes so that's the task and
just figuring out if I can get this
shelf we've had for a while for Mikey
it's like 20 bucks at IKEA I think I'm
gonna try to I think it'll only fit here
and just kind of rearrange so that I can
also leave these up but just be able to
slide them into the closet so we're
gonna kind of declutter as we go oh my
goodness okay we're making a little
progress here so Tyler brought up this
shelf I think I just showed but I'm
pushing it kind of here because I can
still squeeze and get to things but it's
not meant to be like decorative it
really is meant to be functional so I
don't mind that it's kind of more in the
corner because these drawers need to be
in a spot where I can still pull things
out so if they're too far in the corners
then I can't really open the drawers
easily and that's why I decided to put
that there because the other thing is
these I want to be able to slide in but
I think I'm going to move this over here
and move these kind of over here because
really I have my extra filming things
like a blanket I can do close-ups on if
I want things like that and then all of
these hangers I started to take I'm
going to take them down to our basement
closet because they're all extra and I
brought on HauteLook I can link that
below if you're curious because they
were really cheap on there they're like
the cream velvet kind of hanger but they
really have no purpose in here I don't
need them in here and I don't need that
many extras on the same floor so if
you're gonna put them down there until
we need them and that way I've got that
vertical space to be able to put these
taller things kind of in that region
okay so I'm looking in this drawer here
and these are boxes I can declutter I
mean there's no I keep them in case I
need to return anything but guess what I
never need to return anything and then
this case I'm just gonna put elsewhere
it doesn't need to live in this room at
all I'll put it in my closet as like an
extra you know case now looking up here
like I've got I bought a few candles at
Target on sale and I don't really need
those too
can be in a drawer figuring I can either
store them on like the shelf I just put
in or just elsewhere again cords like
this is really prime real estate and
this I'm sure I can find another spot
for so I'm thinking like over here is
where I could put you know if I wanted
to store candles I did end up putting
like my tray up here and this is where I
put like dirty makeup brushes and things
like that by the way the reason I didn't
take this down is because it's ripping
and peeling and I'm like until we can
fix the wall behind it I'm just gonna
leave it up I think that looks better
than like really gross
3m strips it was from the person that
lived here before us and she never took
it down and I thought oh maybe I'll use
it but then anyway um I guess I did hang
a few things up there but so far that is
the plan well I've sketched these over
this box over here we got I think I want
to say we get these at IKEA but this box
I have gifts so things that I've bought
like because it was a really good sale
and I thought oh this would be a good
gift in the future you know candles bath
and body products nice frames nice
headphones random things that we've
accumulated are brand new so we keep
those in case of a rainy day or if we
need like a you know gift exchange kind
of a gift so we always have that box
going and then this is actually items
that I'm giving away whether it's I've
declutter dydt for one reason or another
some of them are new some of them are
not so I like to wait till that's full
and then go through it and donate the
unused stuff to a women's shelter and
then the other half let my sister's go
through so that's what's going on there
sorry I'm so out of breath I guess
that's what I get for filming at like
five and a half months pregnant
um but I love having those and then I
used this like it was like a three
dollar Trash Can I bought at a store and
all I use it for is empty product so I
wait till this gets full and then I film
an empties video so I like to keep this
somewhere in here usually like right
here it's perfect
I like that system and I like that like
those are black I like that that's not
see-through so I'm not just staring at a
lot of products I think if I had my way
these wouldn't be see-through either I
mean it doesn't really bother me it's
just more visual clutter you know
and I did write like labels on them for
the skincare that's inside of each one
do you have keepsake boxes um so like
this one is keepsakes from Tyler or from
me and Tyler like this is a sign that
our friend Carla when we got to Spain
she held up and it said like welcome to
costigan and it was so cool and like
cards Tyler's got me over the years that
were extra meaningful just random little
things like he he had made me a CD when
we were dating oh my gosh when we went
to Mackinac Island just random things I
feel like I forget that I have this box
and I need to be better about putting
things in it so because of course I have
like a wedding box and that's like kind
of different so that's what's in there
and I like to keep that in my closet
here cuz I do have some keepsake boxes
in our basement and then these are like
things from our friends notes from other
friends some youtube things that are
special I want to remember them beyond
just pictures and videos so I don't keep
a lot of keepsakes I'm actually kind of
choosy about what I keep but these I
like to keep up here so I need to find a
spot for these in the closet another
thing we do actually have it backwards
these are all cards so we will sometimes
once a year really every other year
we'll go and buy a bunch of birthday
cards Congrats sympathy that way at a
moment's notice we have a card for what
we need and the reality is cards are so
expensive so you know for at the Dollar
Tree and we see like oh it's two for a
dollar or whatever if we find some cool
ones we'll buy them some of them at the
Dollar Tree you're like yeah but a lot
of them are really cool so this I'd like
to have again where I can reach it not
like all the way in the basement where a
lot of our other stuff is so this I'm
gonna find a spot for as well okay so in
these drawers I had to change my shirt
because I got sauce on it I've made
various I'm like a 5 year old
so these are things that I can totally
get rid of like this I already have
another blow-dryer why in the world
would I need to so this I'm going to
pass on these are hair ties but I really
I don't ever reach in here for hair ties
I usually use some of my bathrooms I'm
gonna move these
my bathroom that goes with that
hairdryer these are products I've
actually started using um this I used
almost all the way to the end I'm gonna
call it it's kind of smelling a little
odd now and I actually really like this
I thought this was really expensive and
then I saw it at the drugstore I'm like
oh it's actually not as bad as I thought
but regardless I I think it's kind of
smelling a little odd I've had it for a
while because I don't use it everyday so
I'm gonna go ahead and put this in my
empties bin this dry shampoo is the one
I'm currently using from bumble and
bumble this I literally just opened up
and use it actually I use it yesterday I
really liked it this caviar CC cream I
also use this is gosh that's almost gone
the or beige right that is the most
expensive hair product I've ever bought
I'm ridiculous and then this braid aid
is actually really cool it helps your
braid kind of stay together so that
drawer needs to be wiped out these are
like products I haven't opened yet so
this is my favorite hair spray of all
time it's a new one so I'm definitely
keeping that but I brought over my clear
drawers to be able to put things in
because that's where I'm not wanting to
move these backups I'm not sure exactly
how I want to separate any of those so
I'm just gonna kind of make a pile so I
have all these drives she said I bought
for anything from Ulta recently so I'm
definitely keeping both of these and
just haven't opened them yet
because I'm using the one um this dry
shampoo from lush I mean does it ever go
bad I I feel like I yeah I've got like
another year I feel like I've only used
it a couple times so I feel like I
shouldn't get rid of it yet but that's
one that I I'd rather just be able to
spray it you know another dry shampoo
holy cow Lee
another dry shampoo Joseph ruk ooh
texture spray okay and I have not tried
this from academia another texture spray
oh my gosh dry conditioner dry
conditioner is a freakin secret weapon
because this is something that if you
are dry shampooing your roots to get rid
of the oil when you kind of brush that
through if you brush it through some
people just use their fingers the ends
of your hair end up looking really kind
of gross and dry so I always spray dry
and those like in the ends of my hair
and it looks so fresh so I love having
dry conditioners on here this L'Oreal
said to me bedazzled it made me kind of
laugh but that's actually completely
awesome and I was so excited and I've
actually never tried well I've tried l
net but it's been a really long time
that's what I should say and it says
this is unscented which is nice so
definitely gonna use that and try it out
Sebastian
this actually is open so I need to move
it because well is it maybe I use the
other one out this is pretty good again
I prefer this is the best hairspray I've
ever tried so this is still what I
prefer but I'm gonna obviously keep it
you set up another dry shampoo oh my
gosh and then this is like a glitter
spray I'm gonna pass this on all right
so that drawer is empty for now looking
in here I have a shampoo and conditioner
from Shea Moisture it's a nourish and
silken shampoo definitely gonna use
these this will probably the next thing
I put in my shower but this see it would
make sense to kind of separate shampoos
and conditioners from sprays you know
what I mean where do I go okay this is a
mousse um have I used this I think this
on I found my favorite mousse of all
time it's the living proof mousse for
curly hair and it is so freakin good
but have I even used this maybe I should
keep it and try it cuz I don't want to
get rid of it and then I have never
tried it what if it's really good and I
know that this brand it's definitely
cheaper than living proof so I will keep
it see how I like it
this is a like a hair oil from Kerastase
I'm definitely gonna keep and use
because right now the hair oil I'm using
is this one from pie shell I'm not sure
how to pronounce it um so when that's
out I'll probably do the Kerastase one
next this is the igk prenup instant
spray hair masque
it says in shower treatment works in
under a minute you spray it in your hair
huh I will try that but I need to
actually put it in my shower um this I
actually bought from a salon it's a
color protecting gel cream and I don't
need it for the color protection because
I
don't dye my hair but it's four hits
basically a heat protectant and she was
saying it would be really good for my
hair so I was like well I'll give it a
try but of course I have it and I have
not given it a try
um Bumble and Bumble surf spray I want
to keep because it's like the only one I
have like that oh just kidding sir Foam
spray ooh I like that this is part
mousse and part salt spray see I'm not
gonna end up getting rid of anything
body moves for air drying moisture
healing mask I love moisture mask I've
got these Kerastase ones I don't know
that I'm I get rid of any of these I
know I recently when my sister came to
town I ended up going through all this
and like giving her a ton of stuff so I
know kind of recently I've gone through
this so I don't know why I'm acting like
I'm surprised this is another repairing
mask so are these and Kerastase is
really expensive so I definitely want to
use those this is a shampoo and I think
these go together so I'd want to
definitely use those together and then
this is an oil I do want to try that as
well so good job just you got rid of
like two things upon further glance I'm
gonna get rid of these for this I think
I like having cuz it's bumble and bumble
and it's like a famous product but I've
only used it a couple times and I don't
really like the way it makes my hair I
think like I was saying I would like the
idea of like it being part mousse but
this just makes my hair kind of sticky
so that I'm gonna get rid of I'm just
gonna get rid of this I know I don't
like it
unicorns mane I just don't need and then
this is partly gone and I feel like I
don't love the way my hair looks when I
use it and so I'm just gonna either put
it my empties been or maybe just pass on
to a sister since like it's halfway gone
my sisters wouldn't mind but that makes
me feel at least a little bit better cuz
I'm like okay this is a lot of crap that
I'm keeping and these are the ones that
when I looked at the pile I thought
mm-hmm I really don't feel that strongly
about them organize it I put anything
that would go in the shower so shampoo
conditioner hair masks for in the shower
all of those are in here and then
basically everything else because these
are things I would use outside of the
shower and even though this is much
fuller
I honestly usually have way more shampoo
and conditioner I just took out one set
and put in my shower so
I expect that this will fill up again
quickly and I like having that room so
so for my organization I just used a
little Avery labels so we have a lock
Tyler uses a lot of them first business
but this is the size of already used and
I grab the marker I use so I'm gonna go
ahead and label these as I'm thinking
shower hair products and then just hair
products cuz I don't want to get it
doesn't need to be that detailed the
reality is it's just for me I know but
if you were curious to see before I do
that kind of what's in these drawers
this is my body care drawer so I've got
you know so lotions things like that and
it's all again these are things that
have not opened I do have some body wash
but I think I'm still gonna leave it in
this drawer instead of moving it's like
the shower products because that's I
just want that to be for hair anyway I
feel like I'm over explaining that so
masks and treatments so I've got some
things in here I just haven't quite
gotten to yet different like even like
eye masks I don't keep my sheet masks in
here because I have them in my bathroom
and I have way too many of those and
then I have my travel toiletries drawers
so I have just all kinds I actually
recently declutter this if you'd like
it's how I've already gotten a lot more
which that's why I declutter but yeah so
that's all of this is the door I go to
every time I travel and starting down
here these cleansers like cleansing
cloths this is my favorite cleanser of
all time this is a backup I just every
time I see it I just like buy it oh I
forgot about this though I'm kind of
excited to try that that's supposed to
be with this cloth anyway and then
moisturizers big ol mix I think yeah I
keep I creams in here as well lots of
lovely things backups of some of my
favorite products like my derma e
products that I love number seven all
kinds of stuff and then I have toners
exfoliate miss Lee it's cuz I needed
somewhere to put all these things
basically so I've got some toners um
like I said kind of miscellaneous but a
lot of it is like toners and exfoliators
uh serums just tons in there and
recently was in that drawer grabbing
some new serums to try and then makeup
removers
I've got got a squishy weird wait do I
have this in here Anna I don't um anyway
and then I also have like my Clarisonic
heads my backups or when I need them
those are also in there so that's the
way I've organized these these I bought
I mean you can buy them anywhere they're
just Sterilite brand they're really good
you guys and if you're on a budget they
do the job and same goes for this this
is oh this stresses me out okay so these
are lip products that I haven't gotten
around to trying or their shades I just
haven't opened yet so I've got stroke of
Beauty NYX some Revlon shades I haven't
open bareMinerals
it's overwhelming and then I've got all
these flower Beauty ones they recently
sent so I want to try all these are the
yeah those are beauty too but my thought
I don't know if I want to do this like
in here or if I was like I want to leave
this actual thing in here but if I want
to find another way to do this because I
feel like they're in hearing that I just
forget about them you know so it's like
well then why did I even separate them
out but I I want to separate the ones
I've used from what I haven't because I
don't wanna a forget about them but also
me which I do anyway but also I don't
want to try all of them it's like I try
one and I'm like okay I don't like this
well then I can pass on open one's on
you know what I mean so I kind of like
having that separation but what I would
like to do is have like a drawer labeled
maybe this one as regrets
so like any time I try a product a few
times and I'm like okay I don't like it
I've got a spot for it cuz as of right
now I don't and then it gets swallowed
back in my collection and then when I'm
like ooh I want to do a regrets video of
products I didn't like I'm kind of
digging through and I forget about a
bunch so I think that would be a good
organization system for me and I did end
up moving this tray back up here this
actually we used to hold cards for us at
our wedding and I made it on Erin
Condren
I love that website I will link it below
anyway so that's that let me go ahead
and show you because this really is kind
of the end I'm pretty much done show you
what I've done before the Sun Goes Down
so you already know what those are I hum
this is a from where I live when they
featured me in there
newspaper is so exciting a really big
moment for me in my life so that's like
really special I need to get it framed
but for now I didn't want it to get all
wrinkled and put away so but I'm kind of
concerned that light will get to it and
faded so I need to get it framed soon
but and I've got a Disney little
calendar there I was able to fit these
in here just fine and I didn't have to
like break them down which is exactly
what I wanted I've got an extra light up
there I don't really use a few hangers
but the rest time I've brought
downstairs and then all of my backup
camera stuff then over here I've got my
backup candles I found a few more in our
hall closet that I pulled out something
we've someone got us at our wedding some
pictures which I was just excited even
though they're kind of tucked away it
makes me happy every time I see this and
I feel back because these hadn't been
put up they'd beaten randomly kind of
put up and they didn't really have a
home so I'm excited about that then I've
got my beauty sponges in there ones that
I really don't reach for that's why
don't I don't care if they're far back
my kind of school supplies I kind of
flipped through and I'm like honestly
this is it doesn't look organized but it
is and that works that's all I need and
then I've got my cards and then I ended
up putting those chords I showed you
earlier chords and extra cards and then
my trash bags for my trash can in here
in that little thing and then my
keepsake boxes and then I'm gonna ask
Tyler to hang this up it was a wedding
gift to me from him anyway just really
special so I feel like it's not a pretty
closet do you know what I mean like I
like it because I know how everything's
organized but it's so functional now
it's so functional to me I love that
I've got open space if I need it
but to me I've got like a cute seaside
that's so useful and then a really
functional section and like I said even
though this isn't Pinterest perfect I'm
laughing because the more I think about
it the more I'm like yeah I would never
post those on Pinterest because people
have like the most beautiful
organization for things I'm like well
here we are guys but it works for me and
so
you're kind of in that mode of
organizing decluttering find something
that works for you it doesn't matter if
it's not if it doesn't look perfect it
doesn't really matter because you're
gonna be more concerned about how easy
is it to access the things you need to
access more often is it organized in a
way that makes sense to you so you'll be
able to find stuff is there stuff in
there hiding that you really don't need
to keep things like that so I am very
content
I feel like hah so there is my nice
clean closed completed closet like I
said if you're interested in thredUP
definitely check out the link below and
use the code Jessica forty-four forty
percent off your first order and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye
