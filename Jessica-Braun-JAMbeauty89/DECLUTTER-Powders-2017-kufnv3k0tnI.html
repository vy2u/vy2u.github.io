loose powders and they're a lot of them
are really good that I'm going to try
and be really ruthless about okay but if
I'm not using them why keep them so
again I'm going to do it the way I've
been doing all Omega clutters where I
just look at it and think okay what
would I go and buy again because I love
it so much the one that stands out right
away is my favorite loose powder I've
ever tried to Laura Mercier loose
setting powder and translucent there's a
reason this has such a cult following
and that so many people like it and I
think it's just such a if you've got a
skin tone anywhere similar to mine it's
just the perfect color where it doesn't
end up giving you a weird white cap I
don't know what it is about it but this
stuff is like magic I've used it flash
photography and it looks great you know
you can bake with it if you like doing
that kind of thing on your under eye eye
it's just amazing good packaging easy to
use it's just the best that's right it's
it is the loose powder that made me fall
in love with loose powders if that makes
any sense because I hadn't really gotten
it before this like I tried a
millionaire monk I don't get why people
love it use it every day but now I do
so that is a easy peep for me another
one that I just recently got that I am
not joking when I say I completely
forgot that I had and I pulled it out
and I'm like oh my gosh like that is
I've got way too much loose powder when
I forget this is the NARS translucent
crystal powder
it looks like I've used it a ton because
these get dirty so easily but I've only
used it like twice and then I forgot I
had it and I know how terrible itself so
I'm excited to have less so that I will
use it so I'm definitely keeping that
try it out some more I have no idea how
I feel about it yet
this is an easy feat this is the
Physicians Formula youthful wear powder
foundation it's got to be the
illuminating finish it is amazing
amazing amazing I use this every day I
travel with it every time no matter what
it's what's amazing about it is it
offers a lot of coverage but it is like
light reflecting it's not go away I
don't mean it's not a highlight of any
needs but it has this beautiful Sheen
about it that makes it look makes your
skin look healthy and that is what I
love I don't want my skin to look crazy
crazy matte which is why I don't have a
lot of mattifying powders here in front
of us I love this this one
just the same these are like do this is
a dupe for this the same exact things I
just said about the physician formula
it's true for the it cosmetics it
cosmetics celebration foundations
elimination it's ridiculous title but I
love it so much you can tell and almost
hit pain actually a kind of halves you
can come to see that I love this so much
but now that I found this I feel like
once I run out of this I'm not going to
need to repurchase it now if they send
it to me I would be overjoyed because I
love it but yeah and just why see if you
saw my foundation be clutter the it
cosmetics CC cream that I love I wear in
light it's the same I wear light and
that's an imperfect amazing amazing
amazing and beautiful and photography
well what else could I not live without
I feel like that's it so now looking at
these let's kind of go through them this
pur cosmetics I love a lot of pure
cosmetic stuff this is just too dark I
had a couple of shades honestly all of
them are a little bit too dark for me so
this is an easy pass it's a beautiful
formula really it kind of reminds me of
those two that I love up there beautiful
packaging I mean I honest to goodness
want to keep it for the packaging but
considering I won't use it it's not
worth it but isn't that just stunning
and it like feels well-made it doesn't
feel cheap but I'm going to say goodbye
there's something to say goodbye to as
well this is the infallible Pro matte to
dark I don't know what I was thinking I
bought this myself it was over the
summer so that was part of it but it's
not a bad powder but I don't really like
super mattifying colors and so on it's
of course not the right shade so I'm
going to pass that on so if you do like
mattifying powders I actually think
you'll like that a lot it's a good one
from the drugstore this I'm going to
pass on this is the shuttle scratched up
this is the Maybelline master fix loose
powder it just leads such a white fake
calf on my skin that it's just not worth
it there are better ones at the
drugstore and I'll show you in a second
so I'm going to pass that one on now
these are my eyes okay I have four more
loose powders left this is a cover FX
one I just got I'm still trying out on a
few guys it reminds me a lot of this
Laura Mercier one they're both really
nice they're both a similar color feel
to the skin I've been using the cover FX
one all week and I
really do like it so I'm going to keep
that my mom and you keep one of these
drugstore loose powders and the elf one
is actually unopened again it reminds me
of the Maybelline one it's a very white
powder it's not bad but again it means
such a white cast that it's not really
worth it for me but I know someone a lot
of people love this so I'm going to pass
this one on out of these I love the
boots number seven the boots number
seven one reminds me of the Laura
Mercier one as well but the NYC one is
actually pretty good because for the OL
I for the same reason because first of
all it is so messy oh my gosh in fact in
a second when I'm on to this but it's
got that kind of beige color versus
white and I like that it's not quite
stark right stark white but it is very
messy so I think I am going to keep both
of these I know I said I was only going
to keep one but I think it is measurable
alright moving on so we've got these
three bare minerals they're pro powder
foundations that they sent this was in
light natural this one's in golden nude
number thirteen and this one's in golden
ivory zero eight so eight nine and
thirteen they look so similar don't they
I mean like can barely see a difference
which kind of tells me like do I really
need all three no they're all going to
kind of have the same effect this one's
the most neutral I think so I think I'm
going to stick with this one and pass
these two on I just don't need both I
actually have like five or six they sent
me then I got rid of some but now just
narrowing it down a little bit more I
feel like I don't really need on so I'm
just going to keep one I'm proud getting
rid of all that good job yes I thought I
would not so this this power is from
Nisha and I love their BB cream that I
have from them if you I mention it in my
foundation to clutter so good comes with
a little sponge beautiful packaging and
then you open it this way it's just a
little bit honestly like too light for
me don't you guys think I know the light
kind of washes out but I really do think
it is so I think I'm going to pass that
on even though
nice but I'm just not using it because
of that reason next thing I have these
two Dukes then I found a deuced video
where I talked about a ton of really
expensive products like YSL here and
then what you can get for cheaper that's
just as good and this was one of them
I'll link that below if you're
interested shameless plug this one's
getting kind of old though it's the YSL
- should caught blur Perfector it's
really nice but it's just getting old
and kind of gross but the idea of these
is that it's kind of like a balm that
you can use to mattify your face but
instead of using powder or like rice
paper you're using this I really like it
but I like the elf one just as much it's
a little bit creamier but I like it a
lot so I'm going to keep the elf one and
I'm going to pass on the honestly I
might just throw away the YSL one we'll
see I might see if my sisters want it
just because it is why I found it's nice
but I'm going to tell them you know it's
kind of old so well okay so this is
everything I'm keeping this is what I'm
getting rid of I feel good about that
because every time I kind of look in the
drawer that house these I felt
overwhelmed and I would see this one and
this one is and know that they weren't
quite right for my skin or my skin tone
and I knew I had three of the bare
minerals and it didn't really matter
which one I grab which is kind of nice
for like kind of overkill I don't need
all of that so I do feel good that it's
much more pared down I don't like that I
still have five setting powders but I
know that it's nice to having drugstore
options that are really really good and
then these three I just really like in
like the NARS and I'm still trying out
so and of course these powders I really
like so not that I would fit up about
50/50 I've got nine here and I had eight
that I'm getting rid of so that is
awesome very proud of that if you
haven't seen my ID clutters before this
not only from this kind of go around for
2017 but also my other ones from past
years that I've done a lot of
decluttering I will link that entire
playlist below if you're kind of in that
mood I hopefully you'll subscribe to see
my other declutter that are coming out
after this and I will see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
