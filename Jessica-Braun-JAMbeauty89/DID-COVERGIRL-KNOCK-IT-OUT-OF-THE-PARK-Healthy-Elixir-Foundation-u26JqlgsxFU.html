to share with you a review and demo of
the new covergirl foundation this is
their vitalist healthy elixir foundation
they say that has vitamins it's got
sunscreen SPF of 20 I have it in the
shade 710 which is the second to
lightest shade they have 14 shades and
it's around 1199 at least at Ulta on all
those books but they only have six
shades but on CoverGirl's website it
says they have 14 so I'm sure it depends
on where you go let's go ahead and read
the claims of this foundation and then
I'll show you my demo of me applying it
I'm wearing it today so covergirl says
discover healthy looking skin bottle new
vitalist healthy elixir foundation is
infused with vitamin E b3 b5 plus SPF 20
for correction protection and perfection
all-in-one this full coverage foundation
makes skin glow with a healthy look from
the inside out it is definitely not a
full coverage foundation when I think a
full coverage I think of the L'Oreal
infallible total cover which I'm going
to show you this is not my favorite
foundation just because it can be
drawing but it is definitely full
coverage look at the swatch here of this
foundation this is what I think of when
I think of full coverage I don't think
of a more liquidy product that really
kind of ended up cheering out the more
you put it on so I think of this kind of
a foundation it's very it's kind of
thicker more mousse light but it
actually stays in place but it can be
drying now it's not necessarily a bad
thing that this is not full coverage and
I'll explain what I mean in a second
they also claim that this gives a
healthy look that I totally agree with I
think this foundation ends up giving
your skin life where it looks like
you're a normal person and you're alive
but it just looks without much more
perfected I would rate this as a medium
coverage maximum but it's really
beautiful
so let's go and look at this product in
action so you can kind of get a better
idea of what I mean okay so I'm going to
apply this just going to apply it to my
hands first and I'm using my L'Oreal
blender this is actually a brand new one
but I have one that I've been using a
time that I love and let's just go ahead
and dive right in this is a pretty
decent color matte
for me this is the shade 710 and it does
have SPF of 20 which I appreciate in
which you are a little higher but at the
same time usually my moisturizer has an
SPF gosh this floral plunge is not as
good as like the first one I got I feel
like a little bit harder to work with
but you can see it's got some decent
coverage right above bite right here and
like a breakout up there kind of a mess
right now
but it still has some decent coverage
okay this is like way more firm than it
should be I might have to switch to a
different I mean this is crazy it's
different okay so I switched to my
flower beauty one which I don't know if
you can tell but this one's like crazy
squishy and this one's like really dense
but my other L'Oreal one wasn't so I
don't know if I just got a bad batch out
of them and so let's keep going with my
flower beauty one I'll link both of
these below I just love how this
foundation makes my skin still look like
skin it doesn't make it look older than
I actually am because I just realized
with so many foundations I might like
them when I first apply them but as I
look at myself in different lighting
throughout the day I just feel like it
ages me I'm only 28 years old and I feel
like sometimes they look older than I
really am especially like if you see me
in person you know now you can still see
a little bit of redness I don't think
this is a high coverage foundation but I
think if you don't have a lot to cover
this is like a step above a tinted
moisturizer or BB cream because it it
does have that coverage but it also adds
this luminosity it's not shimmery by any
means
it's just healthy-looking I think that
they titled this really well it really
every time I worn this I've been wearing
it for a couple of weeks I feel like yes
and it's like all day long I feel like
it wears pretty well
it covers enough and if you ever feel
like you know you need a little bit more
coverage you could always bring a
powdered foundation powdered a powder
foundation or something like that if you
ever felt like you need a more coverage
you know you could apply more I've done
essentially two layers here and I feel
like that's about as
covers as it can get for me my nose is
always red so I feel like that's an area
where I'm kind of self-conscious even in
videos you can see it no matter how much
I try to cover it's kind of crazy
but I feel like that's something I could
just dust some powder foundation on that
because the rest of my skin looks so
nice with it that I still think it's
worth it so obviously I do like this
foundation a lot do I think it's
something that I wear to like an event
where there would be flash photography
no because there's a TS of 20 I don't
want a chance of having a ghost
flashback kind of a white face like that
but the packaging is stunning
I think covergirl finally I feel like
they've been and I don't mean this in a
mean way covergirl not that you're
watching cuz I'm sure you're not busted
but I feel like they've been kind of not
behind the times but kind of behind the
times when it comes to like everyone
else is like doing all this trendy stuff
and cute packaging and I feel like
covergirl just like they're kind of
trying but they keep missing the mark
and I think they really hit this out of
the park this time around the gold and
the white packaging with the clear lid
the fact that I have a pump the fact
that it's more healthy for your skin I
feel like we're all just kind of looking
for something that looks nice but we're
not ruining our skin you know what I
mean I'm so tired of wearing foundations
honestly like this one where I just my
skin ends up looking older than it
really is and I do think this does a
great job of making you look beautiful
so all in all do I think you need to run
out and buy it yes only if you can find
a shade that works because you know
drugstore foundations don't always have
the widest shade range I think 14 shades
is pretty good compared to some but I do
know that some other drugstore ranges do
have more of a color selection however
if you know that everything I've shown
is said about this is totally up your
alley and you're looking for something
like that then absolutely go run out and
get it I hope that this video was
helpful for you guys and if you're
interested in more of my drugstore
reviews videos I will link my playlist
below I have done ton of the foundation
reviews tons of reviews of all kinds of
products out there so hopefully you can
find something that you are interested
in and other
that I hope you'll subscribe and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
