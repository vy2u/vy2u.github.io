to share with you guys a ton of stuff I
got in Disney World the last time I was
there we were there for the marathon
weekend and if you didn't know my
husband is a Disney travel agent and so
you can book your trip and plan your
trip for free shameless plug so I'll
link his website below because that is
what he does
and so we go to Disney all the time we
love Disney we love Disney way before he
even became a Disney travel agent but so
we got a bunch of stuff there it was a
whirlwind he blogged while we were there
and so I will link it I think it's two
different videos so if you want to see
us there and find this stuff and going
through those all the marathon
festivities and also just being in
Disney and eating in Disney I will link
that below but let's go ahead and get
into the hall so the first thing this is
a newer product this is the wall I don't
know what it is it's a black mug it's
like mattified and it has a d for disney
with the sorcerer and Mickey and then on
the other side it says Walt Disney World
2017 I thought holy moly this is so
classy I bought it for my husband just
was kind of a gift since you know he ran
the race it was the very first full
marathon it was just really exciting so
I bought this for him and surprised him
once we got home with this but it's so
nice that we fight over who gets to use
it all the time I think that pretty much
everything I thought I got in mouse key
Epcot because it was kind of like I had
that time to vote and I was like okay
this is when I'm in a shop so I can just
bring everything right home with me
we're back to the hotel so this however
I got um actually on Main Street these
are these little sterling silver mickey
earrings they were dispenses there were
$45 but I've had so many of the cheaper
ones and I feel like I replaced them
every year because they get all weird
and gross because I wear them all the
time so like you know what it might be
time to invest a little bit of money and
a little bit nicer ones because I love
Mickey earrings like this and I liked
that these were a little bit bigger so
they catch the light even more and
they're really pretty but we're annual
top holder so we also got a percent off
so that also kind of took the cost down
a bit but I've been wearing these all
the time I just saved the box so I could
show it to you in there but I love it in
the box is so cute because as a little
Mickey's all over it is a little bow
next thing I got are these little
highlighters I'm a teacher so I use
highlighters a decent amount and these
were again
be pricey for what they are $17.99 that
is ridiculous I'm going to be honest I
didn't know they were that expensive
until after I checked out and I left and
look his receipt and whatnot but they're
so cute I like whatever I will use them
so there's four three colors there's
goofy Mickey Minnie Donald and I think
they're so so cute and they say Disney
parks on them so it was one of those
things I'm like like I said whatever I
will use them they're so adorable I also
got some clothing so I bought a coat
while we were there literally because
the day I only have like two days are so
quick but it was literally in like the
30s when we were there I've never ever
experienced that there and of course I
literally left Indiana where I'd live
and it was like snowy and cold so I left
my big coat in my car when I parked at
the airport and all I kept thinking was
I wish I had my big fluffy thick black
coat so it is so cold and we were
outside you know long enough that I
would but I have to buy a coat and they
happen to have some out probably because
it was cold but it's it's really nice
like furry on the inside coat in the
tags at Disney parks but it has a hood
this up it has pockets but it has little
quilted mickey heads all over it and
it's just plain black and so a lot of
you guys when I was posting you know
snapchats while we were there and things
like that you guys are like oh my gosh
where is your coat from it was bought on
Main Street at the Emporium and I love
it I don't think this is going to be
easy to find honestly and let you maybe
find it online but it I don't think it
will be because I think it's so rare
that they have these out but it was
amazing I've been wearing it just at
home all the time because it is warm
it's kind of a sinner warm jacket if
that makes sense I love it
one thing I've been wearing like
non-stop since I bought it is this
ridiculously retro Escott sweatshirt
it's a true sweatshirt just gray plain
gray on the back but the front has this
really pretty rainbow it says Epcot
Center and I just love it it makes me
think of all like the old Epcot that I
wish I would have seen when it is still
around like very 80s and 90s kind of an
Escott feel and I just love that I love
that it's being brought back
so much and so I had to have it it's
definitely like bigger this is a size
small I didn't see any extra small I
don't know if they don't sell them or if
they were just out but I wanted it to be
big and comfy and just kind of like a
lounge around a house on a really comfy
Saturday kind of a thing and I have
certainly been wearing it a ton it's one
of those things that this is probably a
sweatshirt I'll end up having for 30
years and you know what I mean I'll just
always have it and wear it all the time
next clothing item actually my husband
bought for me is this runDisney shirt
because I was supposed to run a half
marathon there and that's where I came
down however it was canceled literally
the night before I have my flight landed
Friday night the race is supposed to be
early Saturday morning and they canceled
it because there was like a lightning
storm predicted and they they're just
like we can't you know you we can't do
that too much reliability and I get it
and it was very stormy next morning so
it would have been a weird race so they
canceled it it was such a bummer and it
was still fun but it was definitely a
bummer but if you bought me this and I
love the color it's a long-sleeve
running shirt I just love that it says
run Disney I'm sad that was going to be
my first run Disney right she still gave
me the half marathon shirt it's like
yellow I don't know where it is and they
gave you the medal but I'm like feel
like I don't even deserve it
I don't but if I were smart a lot of
people still like went out that morning
at some point when it wasn't raining and
ran the half marathon so they like
either they ran the same course or they
just ran 13.1 mile so they could still
say they did it even if it wasn't
official then they didn't feel stupid
wearing the medal or the shirt and I
kind of wish I'd done that but it is
what it is so we got a couple magnets we
always always always try and buy at
least one mug and we always buy a magnet
everywhere we travel and this time we
bought two one that says the year 2017
because there's our first trip in 2017
it was just cute and then and we always
put all of our magnets from our travels
on our washer because it's magnetic and
then it's not just cluttering up our
fridge but it's still something that
every time you do laundry we can see
them all and we always write the year if
it doesn't say it we always write the
month and year on the back and like
sharpie like a silver sharpie and I also
got Disney's Wilderness Lodge magnet
which is so cute because this is our
first
staying there and it's one that's been
all my list forever to stay at and I
loved it so much and if you want to see
some behind the scenes again check out
that blog but it was so so amazing I
wish I had more time there but I loved
it they also got some pins again we eat
sure and pick out one pin that's
meaningful
except for since he was running I was
doing a lot of the shopping so for him I
picked out since this is his first year
as a Disney travel agent I picked out
this little suitcase that's got like
Mickey stuff all over it I just thought
I was so perfect for him and then I
picked out Cinderella and the reason I
picked out Cinderella this time was
because it was kind of towards the
beginning of January in this the
beginning of the year I'm trying to just
be better this year and what I love is
in the new live-action Cinderella
they're like the phrase but Cinderella
kind of lives by was to have courage and
be kind and I love that it's resonated
with me so much and so just having that
in mind as a goal being more brave and
being even kinder that just I just love
Cinderella and so I thought you know
what this is the one that just stood out
to me and I thought that's the one for
this year so or for this trip so I love
those we don't have a lanyard right now
we kind of keep them in a keepsake box
and we don't really trade since they're
all meaningful not that I'm opposed to
trading because it is something I think
about all the time but I just never have
actually done but if I were to do that I
feel like I would need to buy just once
they don't care about because these are
all meaningful so one other thing I
wanted to show you in this video is
there's this company called Lillian &amp;amp; Co
and of course below lien is Walt
Disney's wife's name and these two
youtubers that I love I will link their
channel below
they are Disney youtubers so they blog
they talk about all things Disney etc
but they also run this company
and so she recently said hey can I send
you some stuff and I was like yes these
are amazing so first of all the
packaging is unbelievable be like they
clearly spent a pretty penny on this the
box is beautiful
so well made they have this beautiful
like velvet pouch that says Lillian in
tow and they sell these beautiful metal
bracelet and they have these Disney
phrases on them and I literally as I'm
looking through their website and like
oh my gosh
literally want all of these so they sent
me three different ones and I love I
kind of asked I like the mixed metal so
this one is gold and it says never grow
up love that and then this one in silver
says there's a great big beautiful
tomorrow which if you love Disney you
know what that's from that it's from the
Carousel of Progress I love that and
then this kind of rose gold one says up
to Neverland and those all three just
make my heart so happy so I loved I kind
of kept the box but it shows you that I
have loved wearing these the past few
weeks just on my arms is kind of mixed
you can totally like bend them to be a
little bit more taut if you want that
feel or if you want to looser I mean
it's kind of up to you but they have
these different metals to choose from
they have even more phrases on there but
they're so pretty if you're a Disney
lover but you don't want it to scream
Disney these are perfect and you can
wear them in your everyday life and so
to you you know you've got a splash of
Disney but other people don't so this
doesn't sponsor by number anything like
that I just thought it was really cool
and I really think we'll see something
to me so I had to show them to you guys
so I will link these their website and
these products below if you are just
interested you can see a great gift to
like if you've got someone that loves
Disney they would love this like I
talked about a mile a minute and I also
feel like I swear there things I missed
but if you love Disney hauls I've done
quite a few on my channel I will link
all of them below I just go ham when I
go to Disney every time and we go like
you know five times a year it feels like
but I still always by way too much I
just love it and I wear it all the time
