a Disney Hall holy-moly I bought a lot
of stuff from Disney World stuff from
the Disney Cruise and also stuff that I
bought on Etsy or that some of you
lovely people have sent me that also
have your shops so I will link anything
that I bought like from Etsy or that's
from one of your guys's shops that maybe
you sent to me I will link those shops
below and of course I'll mention as I go
so if you enjoyed this kind of video
definitely give it a thumbs up and let's
go ahead get into it so one thing that I
used was this bag for years to travel
with and lovely subscribers sent me this
and a whole set of these with this
really cute print so I will put the link
for these um clear bags below cuz she's
got all kinds of prints Tyler got one
that was like the TSA size and it had
just it was like black with Mickey's on
it love them real I mean they're perfect
and I have like a whole set so I used
the TSA sized one and I used like a
little wallet size thing she sells all
in this same really cute like Disney
doodles pattern I think it was called
but this is meant to hold ears of course
you could have a whole toiletries as
well but that's how I traveled so these
were the ears that I brought with me to
Disney World this one I bought on Etsy
beforehand
oh um like a hot glue or something I
love it it's light pink velvet and cream
velvet it was so comfortable so well
made I just like fell in love with this
thing isn't it so cute so that was like
something that I had ordered
I mean honestly when I wrote it from
Etsy I always like factor in like a
month of shipping time sometimes it
takes forever
but I don't think this one took too long
so I'll try to find the link to it below
but also a different subscriber has a
shop and I've got again I'll link these
below and these were some ears she sent
to me I loved this one it made me think
of like Jasmine which is the character I
was playing when I met Tyler he's
playing Aladdin if you didn't know so
this one was very special to me and I
actually took a picture of my baby bump
in a shirt I bought on Etsy that says
like shining shimmering splendid on it
and wore these with it and they matched
so well and another one I loved was this
one so it has that
Disney doodles print but it has this
navy blue bow and again these were so
comfortable so well made I've had a lot
of ears from Etsy over the years and
these were probably all of these were
like incredibly well made like as good
as Disney if not better and they're way
more comfortable than Disney because the
Disney ones that you buy are so tight on
your head it's so uncomfortably tight
so speaking of Disney ones this one I
actually didn't buy in Disney I'd had my
eye on this for like a friggin year it's
a holiday set of ears and I really
wanted them they had them on the Disney
World website like the Disney parks
shopping actual site for half off it was
like twelve dollars so I was like yup so
I placed an order and bought these and a
couple other things we're also annual
pass holders so we you know you get a
discount off of it as well but I haven't
even worn these I mean I literally got
them in the mail after the fact but we
weren't really going over the true
holidays anyway so I just wanted to have
them for future visits you know but I
love them I mean I've now gotten to the
point where I'd so many ears I need to
figure out like an organization system
so holla if you have any ideas but that
was such a good deal and while we were
in the parks they still had this for the
full price so I was like when in doubt
if it's a seasonal one check on their
app before you buy it in the park
because they weren't on sale in the park
as far as I knew they weren't marked
down like on the price tag but they were
half off at the same time on the app Oh
some sweet things when we first checked
in at the contemporary we say to the
contemporary went on a cruise and then
we came back and stayed at the boardwalk
for a few days before coming back and
then I had to go back to work but we
told them we were expecting of course
our first and so the lovely cast member
that was checking us in he was so he
clearly loved his job and it was so fun
but this one says happy birthday baby
Bron and then this one says first visit
coming soon
so I thought those are so cute he even
put tape on top so that it wouldn't like
wear off
so I figure these will be something
we'll have to put maybe in the nursery
somewhere something cute like that we
have a long ways to go in that nursery
whoo oh my gosh
something free we got on the cruise on
pirate tonight we were on the Disney
Dream and it was so much fun so they
give you everyone in your room a little
pirate handkerchief
so I ended up tying it like through how
did I do it I ended up just tying it
like through my hair like that I think
Tyler I don't know what he did with his
but I think that was cute and it's free
and I thought that was sweet cuz we
didn't bring like pirate costumes we
don't have kids yet so I don't know I
mean I guess we could have but anyway we
just didn't but that was so fun we could
still kind of participate okay these are
all gonna be out of order and there is
gonna be a giveaway involved you'll see
so this was one of my favorite purchases
so in Disney Springs if you go to the
store Uniqlo they have I mean it's kind
of a regular store I mean there's tons
it reminds me in a way of H&amp;amp;M like same
kinds of prices overwhelming amount of
clothing for men and women and children
but what's amazing is they have little
sections of Disney stuff of course and
so this was awesome it's literally a
dark gray sweater or sweatshirt that
just says Mickey Mouse and on this the
sleeves it's got a little picture of
Mickey whistlin and here it has a little
music note because it was like a line of
like he's called like sounds of Disney
or something like that so it was all
about different things like that so that
was one of the items and I want to say
this was like 18 or 19 bucks if I had
bought this in Disney World like from
Disney parks I am sure it would have
been easily 4550 dollars I mean
everything at Disney is so expensive
clothing included so Uniqlo is an
amazing place to buy you know kind of
disney license stuff for way cheaper so
one thing here's the giveaway portion
I've got a lot more to show but one
thing I was on the hunt for the whole
time was the rose gold spirit jersey I
had so many of you guys tagged me in
post saying like I've seen it at world
of Disney or I bought it a few weeks ago
here and it was sold out and some of you
guys worked there knew I could sold out
well they happened to restock like one
of the days I was there at Maus gear in
Epcot and sounds cool
yeah and I couldn't believe it like
literally Tyler we have our Disney vlogs
if you're interested on Tyler's channel
I can link that below as well and in the
video I'm like actually losing it like
genuine because I couldn't believe I
thought I had already given up hope you
know
so it's so cute it's got the gold while
Disneyworld on the back I'd already
bought one of these last year in
Disneyland the black one that just says
Disneyland
it really is less of a rose gold more of
just a pure peach and then that's just a
gold you know it's just gold so that's
what time there was remarking he's like
it's not rose gold I'm like I know but
it's the essence of rose gold it doesn't
really matter so when I went there I
picked one up for myself but a lovely
subscriber had also I guess she is a
cast member and she had also seen them
and knew I was on the hunt so she bought
me one anyway and so she actually
dropped it off at the front desk at the
resort who say it was also incredibly
sweet and so I snapped her back and I
said oh my gosh like I ended up buying
one and you know I'll still pay for it
etc and she was like no no it's a gift
do whatever you want with it I'm like no
like that is way too nice these are
expensive genuinely she's like well I'm
a cast member it it was so incredibly
sweet like that is one of the nicest
things I think anyone has ever done for
me just so I was overwhelmed with
gratitude and so I said okay well it's a
size small tags are still on it and
everything so I figured well what better
way to give back since she was still
giving to me then to give back to you
guys so there will be a giveaway link
for this if you are interested and
winning it I'm sorry it's only one size
I mean it's kind of a random giveaway
it's a size small but I will say this
these definitely run large like truly
truly I'm pregnant five months so and I
bought an extra small and it's still big
on me like you can't even see my bumps
so these definitely run large that's the
way they're meant to be it's more of
like a boyfriend comfortable kind of a
fit so even if you're a medium or maybe
a smaller large I think you'd be just
fine but they're like I said they're
meant to not be super fitted so if
you're wanting to win this size small
rose gold sphere Jersey just enter with
my link below and that was so incredibly
sweet thank you lovely subscriber that
sent this to me because that was just
that just like touched my heart so
giving in so kind so another thing I
bought on the cruise line I know this is
in like the most random order I'm so
sorry
was this long-sleeve tee it was cold
while we were there is
January but it just says Disney Cruise
Line on the back I love that it's kind
of like a worn out red color it's super
soft and it was just so cozy again like
I said I'm pregnant and I was like I'm
eating a ton on this cruise because
that's what you do on a cruise and then
I just felt like you know what I mean
and so it was so nice to have something
like this that was a little bit looser
and just cozy to where I loved it I am
honestly excited now that I've shown it
and I've already washed it to wear it
again so another thing we bought was
this bag I've had my eye on this bag for
a long time and I don't know what it is
about I mean obviously it's classic
Minnie Mouse but we always bring like a
random bag with us to I'm like I'll fold
it and have it at the bottom of my
suitcase when we head to Disney that way
I can fill it with souvenirs check one
of the bags and carry that one on with
like mums and things that we buy that
are breakable that I would want with me
in my carry-on but the bag we would
always bring is really really like huge
like it's way too big and so I always
kind of wanted this for that purpose we
ended up genuinely needing one because I
forgot to bring our normal souvenir bag
so this is perfect it's pretty darn
strong you could check it if you needed
to assuming you don't put anything
breakable in it and actually I did end
up checking it I think I had clothing in
it but it zips really nicely as well so
this was an awesome purchase I was so
excited to get it um why are there pants
in here I have random black pants in
here why anyway um so one of the things
that I bought was this hat and I post it
on snapchat at the time like hey and I
tried this on and they had a couple
other hats and overwhelmingly you guys
were like that hat because it was rainy
while we were there and frankly it rains
every time anyone's ever in Disney you
know what I mean it's just it's Florida
weather and so how does such a nice
thing to have and frankly ears I love
but I can only wear them for so long
because if you're wanting to wear
sunglasses with them it's almost
impossible because you have to like
layer the sunglasses with the headband
and so I'm always like grappling like do
I want to wear yours today or is it
super sunny and I wear
because it's so hard to do both but with
this I totally could be both or no
sunglass at all cuz there's a brand and
it's so cute the normal one that a lot
of people have I think is like red with
the red and white polka dots but I
really really liked this black one so I
was pumped to own that one well let's
see also bots have all these like
packaged up here oh I'm some magnets we
always buy one with the year so this one
just said 2018 and it had a lot of this
retro little prints on it of like
different rides restaurants things like
that and then we also like to get one
something to represent the resort we
stayed in if it's our first time and
this was the Contemporary Resort magnet
and it was kind of the only one they had
so I think that's fine
and we like to keep our magnets we just
always buy one it's so small so no
matter where we travel we'll just buy
one because they're so small and we love
to have we don't put it on our fridge we
put it on typically like our washer and
dryer so we can just see it like right
on the front although we're Tyler's
gonna build like a magnetic backsplash
for our washer and dryer area like our
laundry area and we'll put them all
there and I cannot wait anyway just
because we ate brings us such a joy to
see them and there's so many memories
attached to them and so that's just it's
just fun um alright let's see we also
bought am love what soon they wrap them
so well which I appreciate that at the
same time like when you're unwrapping
you're like alright this is a lot this
is the one I picked out from the cruise
line so it's this little striped mug it
says Disney Cruise Line it's got Mickey
that looks a lot more like the Mickey we
see in like the new cartoon shorts they
have and then it says see you're real
soon se EA I thought this was so cute I
loved this I am from a Navy family like
my dad my older brother my older sister
my younger brother so many of them have
been or are in the Navy so even anything
like with anchors and things like that
is already something I'm like attracted
to but the fact that it was Disney
Cruise - it just makes it even more
special so Tyler's mug that he picked
out
is this like smokestack one it looks
just like well it looks similar to the
ones they have on the cruise and I
thought that is so cool it's a little
bit slanted as well and I thought that
was such a neat purchase so these are
both really cool mugs to add to our
collection and the way we do it because
we own so many mugs now we actually have
a big tote we leave in our basement and
every few months really like every
season will bring the tote up and we'll
put away the mugs we've had out for a
while and we'll pull out other ones we
haven't had out so we kind of switch
through them and it makes it so much
more exciting when you pull one out you
haven't seen in a while so it's a little
trick if you have a lot of mugs in your
cabinet like overflowing that stresses
me out because I worry they'll fall and
so that's a great trick that once we
started doing we were like oh my gosh
why haven't we done this forever all
right what else
oh we of course got a Disney Cruise Line
magnet pretty standard simple one to add
to our collection oh we got since this
was our babymoon our last kind of big
vacation especially Disney vacation
before we have a kid we know his no snow
off no it was wrapped so good
well his nose fell off to super glue but
it's Mickey and Minnie just sitting
together on a little anchor and it's a
little ornament I thought that was
really cute and you know it's kind of
our last time it'll be just the two of
us so all right I gotta let tether know
about he's gonna be sad about this nose
situation all right and then we also got
an ornament of we were gonna just get
one one of it but then we just went
crazy we bought two of the ship because
it was our first time on the Disney
Dream and so we decided they had a
little Disney Dream ornament of the
actual ship and we were like that's
perfect we've bought these kinds of
ornaments from like other cruise lines
we've sailed with and that's it's just
kind of fun we'll have a little
collection of cruise ships Oh something
we bought for my dad was this partner
statue um it's actually an ornament
he had joked I said dad do you want
anything from Disney this time cuz he
went with us last year and he they loved
it as well and I
did you want anything from Disney World
he was like I just thought that partner
statue there if you could just pull the
real thing down and bring it home I'm
like ha ha and then we saw this so
you're like oh my gosh so it's perfect
so and he loves the history of Disney
like you know the stories about Walt and
all of that too so I think he actually
will like it but it also just made me
laugh we did order from the Disney shop
parks app some things things that were
super breakable we ordered on the apps
so like for example we wanted this snow
globe with the castle in it and we've
been wanting it for years and so finally
we were like we're not it's so
impossible to pack it's so heavy to have
it a carry-on and for us to go to the
cruise and then back so we ended up
ordering it on the app with a few other
things and we still got our annual
passport or discount but then it was
just shipped to our home I'm so
beautiful so easy but we had to force
ourselves to do it before we waited too
long because our problem was like oh
we'll just order those on the app and
then we'd be home for three months after
Disney we're like let's why order it now
you know anyway so that's stuff we do
have some stuff coming like he picked
out a mug that's coming
we got a few gifts on there as well that
we're just gonna be harder to transport
but totally back to what we're talking
about we did get a popcorn bucket this
is the one that was on the cruise line
it although it just says Disney parks so
it's got Space Mountain on it there's a
bunch of the characters the Train
Haunted Mansion Cheshire Cat so that was
kind of fun I think on the cruise like
you'd buy it for like seven or eight
bucks and then you could refill it for
like a dollar - of course we never ended
up refilling it and it was actually a
nightmare to bring home we need to clean
it but but I thought you know what it is
kind of cute and it'll be fun like if we
have movie nights for a little kid oh
she can have her popcorn and in here I
don't know I'm just thinking of cheesy
things oh so said anyway so one thing I
always bring with me is a whole bunch of
quarters and pennies to get different
like pressed pennies and we have our
pressed penny little collection well we
did get some new ones and I got a few
pressed quarters this time - it's funny
because I saw her he hadn't bought very
many and I was kind of disappointed
pointed in myself because at the end of
the day I'm like oh geez like the press
quarters that's a dollar that's five
quarters a dollar twenty five but then
I'm like Jessica that is a souvenir that
only cost you a dollar twenty-five like
even a magnet is like $7.99 it's so
funny how her mindset is so like skewed
but I actually got a lot so some of the
press quarters I got I got one that says
Contemporary Resort and it happened to
have jasmine and Aladdin on it what are
the odds so that was just a cool random
fine I also got one that said Polynesian
with lilo on it we stayed at the
Polynesian last summer for a little
while and so but we never got a quarter
I don't think that said it and then we
also got a press quarter that said
Tomorrowland and it just has like the
astral orbiter and stuff and I love
Tomorrowland so much so I read excited
by that one and then the pressed pennies
we got we got one that's at Disney
Villains and it was two of seven and I
thought that could be fun I've never
gotten any of the ones that are like
there's a certain amount of them and you
could try to find all of them so I'm
like that's kind of fun so this was
number two of seven and it has scar on
it I know you guys can't see I got one
that has Pocahontas on it one of my
favorite characters
I got an Epcot one that has like goofy
as the Epcot ball
I got another Haunted Mansion when I
already own like one or two of them I
got one of it was on Main Street
probably at the Emporium but it's goofy
with a bunch of Mickey balloons I
thought that was just kind of cute dang
I did get a bunch of these I got an
animal kingdom one with it looks like
Donald Duck yeah I got another
contemporary one but this one's a penny
and it's a picture of the actual resort
with the monorail we love saying at the
contemporary it was it was actually so
much fun and then we always get one with
the year so this one says 2018 the year
to be here and then I got one of the
princess in the frog tight at Tiana one
of my other favorite characters so like
I said I feel like there's like
smatterings of other things I did buy
and I'm like forgetting to show you but
that's pretty much everything if
are interested in seeing my past
Disneyworld hauls I do them a couple
times a year because we go all the time
obviously with us having our kiddo in a
few months it'll slow down for a bit but
of course we plan on bringing her
eventually too so if you have any tips
tricks for bringing young uns to Disney
it's funny because we're so used to
going as adults it was gonna be quite an
adjustment for us which is so funny I
know like people I work with that don't
get it there are a lot of people I work
with that are the obsessed with Disney
and it's awesome because they get it but
a lot of people that don't quite get it
are like wait so you guys go a couple
times a year and it's just two adults
like yeah man
it is amazing and so it really is gonna
be a very different experience with a
kid oh of our own we are very excited so
other than that I hope you enjoyed like
I said check out my other Disney World
hauls I'll link my most recent view down
below oh and if you want to see our
vlogs of our trip there all of it most
of them are already up there on Tyler's
channel which is kind of like our vlog
channel I'll link that below I hope he
will subscribe and go tell him I said hi
because like I said in the other video
it's like brownie points for me anyway
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
