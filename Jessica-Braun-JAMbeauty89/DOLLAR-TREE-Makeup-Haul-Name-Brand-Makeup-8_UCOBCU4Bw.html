bringing you my very first Dollar Tree
haul video now this is not the first
time I've gone to the Dollar Tree oh my
gosh I go there like twice a week I'm a
teacher so I buy all kinds of things
therefore that they just got amazing
deals on everything from like containers
to hold things in to hair supplies to
makeup which I'm going to show you today
to just all kinds of things that you
could possibly need so I love the Dollar
Tree this was inspired by my friend
April
Athena here on YouTube we're both
subscribed to each other and I just
adore her and she has been doing these
lately I want to say she's done like
three and I can't stop watching them and
so I am so excited she just inspired me
to do really I'm like totally copying
her but I thought this is so much fun
and so I went out found as many amazing
makeup products as I could from the
Dollar Tree and I had to share them with
you guys too because I think this is
cool I can link her channel below
because she's done like I said like
three of them so far and she's planning
on doing a bunch more I think is so fun
let me know if you'd like me to do more
of these as well I know it's kind of
different but hey if you've got a dollar
tree near you you need to know when
there's amazing things there so the
first thing I want to show you before I
get into the makeup are the containers
that I found there they have been
selling this side here let me take these
out they're just primers these
containers that are like acrylic and
they have this size and then they also
have this size so they're like longer
and thinner and they are a dollar and
every time I see them I've gone to many
different ones around me I buy all that
they have because they always only have
like three or four laughing like ha so
you know not all of them but so far I
have about all that they have boom
anyway they're amazing so that is quite
a fine because those can get really
pricey depending on where you go so
that's cool so into the makeup I'm so
excited there was so many goodies there
okay the first thing I grabbed out of my
bag here is this Maybelline Color show
nail lacquer it is in the shade crushed
candy and it's like this really really
pretty like pink with sparkles and I
remember when these first came out I got
a bunch of them and I kept I don't even
know if I have any anymore so I was
interested to see them like well I
wonder I mean these are I don't know
let's see how
pick this is because the packaging was
always cute so let's see it oh it
doesn't look opaque at all hmm
no wonder was at the Dollar Tree and
that's just the the gamble you run is
you know they could be really really
crummy because they are at the Dollar
Tree
meaning that you know there's probably a
reason that Maybelline is there but
sometimes it's just cuz they've
discontinued and they're not bad but
other times they're discontinued because
they are bad so we're gonna see so that
maybe it does maybe say wait for now
okay the next thing this one I've
already opened this is the LA Colors
eyeshadow trio in orchid and it has
these three beautiful colors let's get a
swatch of some of these wow they're so
pigmented wow they're so buttery I'm
saying wow but I already know like how
I've been using these but it's still
like amazing to see because this was a
dollar and these colors are totally like
actually wearable like actually good so
very excited about this one and that's
something that is gonna be I mean it's
just it's amazing it's a gem and people
don't know about it
the next thing I picked up which could
be a dud is an elf product now usually
elf is a dollar so if it's a one that's
already normally a dollar I wouldn't buy
it unless I just needed it at the time
but this one would normally be three
dollars because from their studio line
and it was a dollar it is the concealer
pencil and brush so it looks like
there's concealer shade here on this
side and I got mine in the shade fair of
course and of course this is already
darker than my skin tone are a little
more yellow but this might be really
nice under the brow bone to just here
let's try it to just try and you know
kind of make your brows stand out a
little more
it is certainly pretty darn close to my
skin tone but that was kind of nice
actually oh that looks really nice
doesn't it so that's ball or I'm totally
using it that way now the other side is
a brush and it's kind of like a silicone
brush that I guess you could use to
blend it out
I highly doubt I'll use that my fingers
work pretty well but
nice to have and if you're in a pinch on
the go this might be nice but that
actually is perfect so very cool see
that was an awesome fine alright the
next thing is this Maybelline wear and
go long wearing lip liner this is in the
shade silvered plum and it it certainly
is a plum color see I don't have one
this color so that's really nice it
feels creamy enough it doesn't feel
dried out or anything like that either
so that is really nice I had not seen
this kind of packaging though so I'm
wondering just how long ago were these
in stores but it's it doesn't seem dried
out it's really nice
I got another nail polish and this is
from LA Colors and does it say the shade
yes
cocktail it's just a really pretty like
purplish-pinkish clitter which i used to
have one like this for a long time and I
don't need more let's see how big it is
though actually that's pretty nice and
of course glitter is not necessarily
always opaque and I probably use this to
go on top of another color but glitter
wands try it out so quick that I you
know I usually will buy a really cheap
one and just use it until it's dead and
then get anyone the next thing I picked
up was this Milani baked eyeshadow
remember all of these are a dollar like
it just blows my mind it's in the shade
fusion it's one of their wet and dry eye
shadows and it's a really pretty color
let's see how it swatches yeah I mean
this is absolutely gorgeous and if you
use it wet it's going to be even more
pigmented but it's such a pretty color
and it's so pigmented and it was a
freaking dollar just a nice bronzy color
alright the next one's of these I
haven't opened yet and they're a lot
from I've got a bunch of Milani and
Maybelline here so let me get them kind
of let me get out
oh my gosh I'm so excited about these I
could not believe these were $1 you guys
oh my gosh okay I got three of each
three Milani and three Maybelline here
these were the maybelline ones that I
got I hope your jaw hit the floor when
you saw that these were a dollar it's
the master smokey by eye studio
mechanical pencil and I have emerald
fury smoldering violet and blue blaze
here and it says that it is a
long-lasting smokey eye look in two
steps so I'm just gonna open one of
these here and let's see it looks like
there's like a smudger yeah a smudger
sponge on one side and on the other is
the actual see it's a thick pencil
though look how thick this is so that is
interesting
how does it look though oh it's really
nice I mean it's really creamy and
that's the emerald fury right yeah
that's the green one
so I mean really nice like I said it
does get to be really thick but I mean
if you're doing a smoky eye that works
now so you take the smudger oh oh I took
all of it off you know oh all the lid
just flew across the room so you take
the smudger and you can kind of smudge
it out of course I'm doing it sloppily
because it's on my hand but I mean it
certainly goes away although that would
look nice and smoky so I'm just kind of
trying to get rid of get it off sponge
um it's nice I mean I almost feel like
you don't necessarily have to smudge it
out though because it's really pretty
just the way it is so I could not
believe these were a dollar I mean oh my
gosh let's go ahead and swatch the other
two just so you guys can see them this
is the one in blue blaze and that is a
really pretty blue color you see how
they're not quite like they're almost
more like a crayon like a colored pencil
a water color they're not like crazy
blue and I'm betting that's why they're
at the Dollar Tree however it's still
really nice and for your lower lash line
especially if you're doing a smoky look
you don't need it to be a stark blue
it's still really nice but I could see
why it would have been brought to the
Dollar Tree do you guys know what I'm
saying so this is the last one from this
line and smoldering violet see that's
like a different
color I feel like so many the purpose I
get or either crazy purple or more like
indigo and this is like a a true violet
but a little deeper it's really really
pretty so I think these are pretty darn
cool to be honest with you the last
three makeup products they are from the
Dollar Tree are Milani products this
over here the purple one is the shadow
eyes in royal purple so it's like an eye
shadow cream a cream eye shadow like pen
and then these two here are their
ultrafine liquid eyeliner and emerald
glisten and then sparkling turquoise so
these were all a dollar can you guys
believe it I swear these were just in
stores like yesterday so I've heard
really good things about the shadow eyes
so let's start with that a lot of people
love like the cream the more neutral
colors this one is that purple one again
a really pretty purple color really
creamy I see nothing wrong with this I
would bet this is their just because the
color wasn't being purchased because not
too many people are gonna go out wearing
purple but it's really really pretty oh
my gosh it's so pretty and you could
kind of blend it out and make it a
little less harsh and then put a pretty
color on top a prettier purple I mean
this is beautiful you just got to find a
way to make it work okay so let's go
ahead and swatch the liquid liners for
Milani this one is the one in emerald
glisten and the brush is kind of like
the Stila ones except for a lot less
expensive Wow oh my gosh you guys look
at that like this is unbelievable I
cannot believe you for a dollar let's
see the blue one this one's the one in
sparkling turquoise oh my gosh this is
just so pretty this one doesn't seem to
be let me dip it one more time to do
another one next to it there we go
I hadn't dipped it enough so there's
like a true swatch right there on the
top this is so these are just so
gorgeous I oh my gosh and all of the
things I've heard about all of the
Milani liners is that they stay put like
whether it's the lake of ones or the
pencil ones whatever they don't budge so
I cannot believe these are dollar all of
this stuff like it's unbelievable to me
that these amazing eyeshadows and all
these like liners and shadow sticks and
stuff that are you know right over there
anywhere from probably four to ten
dollars could all be a dollar I ended up
spending one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
for these twelve dollars and getting
twelve things I mean it's just
unbelievable to me now you know how much
people will spend originally you know or
how much companies will charge
originally and even though you know
their drugstore president it's not as
expensive as other things that would
short it's unbelievable so just keep
your eyes peeled and the other thing to
keep in mind is that dollar trees across
the board like you could go to one I
could go to one near my house and find
some of this and then go to one maybe on
the north side of town and find
completely different stuff so but a lot
of times across the board you can find
the same things that were like
discontinued at the same time but you
really do have to keep your eyes peeled
it's amazing and the stock changes all
the time let me know if you'd like to
see more of these in the future I don't
know how often I would do them because
like I said you you know it takes a
while for them to get a bunch of new
stuff if that make sense enough to do a
video on so I would love to do it more
often though if you're interested give
it a thumbs up subscribe for more and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye
anyway the cozy mug is a subscription
box that is like coffee and tea related
and this this is a company that I
started working with them and I use that
term loosely because I'm not like I'm
not an affiliate I'm not I'm not
sponsored they just send me this each
month which a lot of companies do and
I'm very open with you guys about that
but this is one that the guy that
created it he would like since like my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
