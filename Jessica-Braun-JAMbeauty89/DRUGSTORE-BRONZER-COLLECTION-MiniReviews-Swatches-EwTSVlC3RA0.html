to share with you my drugstore bronzer
collection these are all of the bronzers
I have that I bought at the drugstore
and I just kind of wanted to share with
you guys my thoughts on every single one
of them so it's going to be a bunch of
mini reviews and swatches of these down
below I'll have links for everything I
mentioned as well as any information I
can share like the price and how many
shades they offer I hope that you'll
subscribe and if you like this kind of
video give it a thumbs up and definitely
check out my other drugstore collection
videos I've done highlighters that I've
done primers so far and if you'd like to
see more of this kind let me know down
below what you'd like to see next
otherwise let's go and get into it
alright let's start with one that not a
lot of people are talking about this is
the Revlon powder blush but it's at a
bronze shade it's in the shade bronze
beauty now I have the sum of the blushes
as well and on altas website it looks
like there are 9 different shades and I
would say maybe two of them are more
bronzer II there's another one called
dare to bear that looks a little bit
more like light and peachy
but this one is definitely a bronzer
shade and while I don't think this is
the most pigmented thing in the world I
think it's really nice only if you want
a really light wash a bronzer I think if
you're really wanting to look bronze
this is not the one to go for it's not
one of the best ones in the drugstore
for sure but I don't think it's terrible
it's kind of on the part of the spectrum
where I really don't think it's great
and if I I'm sure this is one that in
the future I'll probably eventually
declutter just because I don't reach for
it as it is and there's not I don't know
it's just is kind of a matte product and
as I try to swatch more and more really
you can't build it up a ton but it does
look nice for just a really light wash
of a bronzer and this breeze out by the
way for $10.99 at Ulta so I feel like at
that price point I don't think it's
really worth it the next one I'm going
to mention is one that is very highly
talked about and that is the butter
bronzer I think that proper name is the
Muru Muru butter bronzer this one
retails for $14.99 unless you can find
it on sale I have it in the light shade
and they also have a deeper shade this
smells amazing it's super buttery but
again it's really really light so here's
the butt
bronzor that one is the Revlon one so
the Revlon one is actually darker
however this one is so blendable and
easy to apply that in which is looking
beautiful and it I feel like when you're
blending it on it does look a little bit
darker than that but of course you could
just get the deeper shade I really do
like this there's no reason so many
people talk highly about it and that
reason is because it's genuinely really
good it's surprisingly buttery for a
drugstore priced product and of course
it smells amazing so that's just an
added bonus and it stays on for a long
time so the next one is my favorite
bronzer of all time even above high-end
ones it's my favorite and that would be
the number seven match-made bronzers I
have two shades caramel and eye golden
sands caramel is a little bit deeper and
then golden sand is my personal favorite
currently although if I'm self-tanning
which I did I'm thinking this might be a
better option soon but I love the
packaging these retail for $12.99 and
actually have three shades but they're
so beautiful again they're one of those
bronzers that when you swatch them
you're kind of like and like it doesn't
really look like much but then when you
apply them to this face they're so just
beautiful with many of these you're
obviously using a brush and so your
finger is not the way you're applying it
anyway finger swatches are never the
best way to see like any product ever
but regardless that's especially true
for bronzers but these lasts a long time
and I just love them so so much they're
totally works for $13 whereas like if
the Revlon one is almost that same price
I was definitely saying go for these the
next one is more of a contour powder and
it's from pixie which you can buy at
Target it's their natural contour powder
and it's in the shade shape and shadow
this one's very intimidating it's $20 so
it's one that I almost didn't consider
drugstore and I'm so on the fence with
pixie and so on the fence with it I'd
consider them drugstore and I almost
been included but I figure it might be
worth mentioning if you're really
looking for a contour shade from the
drugstore this one is so so good it's
very gray toned totally what you'd want
for a true contour this is incredibly
pigmented incredibly creamy and easy to
so it's got everything going for it
really sleek packaging the cute pixie
color that like light green that they
always use but definitely a contour not
a bronzer so that is something to keep
in mind and like I said it is $20 so
it's still on the pricier end of things
now let's talk about what bronzer I'm
wearing today this is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster little trio it's
their contour kit it retails for $14.99
again you can always wait for a sale or
a bio and go and 40% off 50% off but
they have two versions of this they have
a shimmery version which I do not own
and then they have this matte version I
love this it's great because it has the
bronzer which this is what I'm wearing
today it's definitely a bronzer shade
very pigmented then they has a contour
shade which is really really pretty more
of a gray tone and then they have this
light matte white shade the bronzer is
definitely the most pigmented of them
all and you do have to be careful when I
was applying this today I had to grab my
foundation sponge and kind of blend it
back in because it really can get
heavy-handed with that shade but these
are amazing they stay on all day I use
this for my sweat proof tutorial today
and I totally believe that these are
sweat proof they're beautiful and it's
one of those things that's such an
awesome collection all three of these
products are good and it comes with a
brush that you actually could possibly
use you know it's not totally useless
another favorite of mine from the
drugstore that is probably I think it's
the cheapest one I'm going to mention
this is $4.99 it's from essence and it's
their Sun Club matte bronzing powder
they have two shades I get the lighter
skin they have a deeper one as well and
it's one of those that it kind of smells
nice like a light hint of coconut not
nearly as strong as this it's very light
but it is a nice scent and it's just one
of those perfect bronzers that like if
you've got fairer skin you can totally
make this work for you it's actually
surprisingly creamy it blends really
well again it's really light so if you
are any darker than me you definitely
want the deeper one but I love how big
the pan is you can totally grab a giant
brush just swirl it in there and apply
it to your face and it's just so
beautiful so foolproof I just love it
for five dollars you cannot eat that
okay so next is
that I get so many questions about what
my thoughts are on it and that is the
elf contour palette this is six dollars
which it's got a giant mirror it has
four different shades it has more of a
great contour a lighter bronzer a kind
of yellowy matte highlight and then a
white kind of shimmering highlight so
they're all super pigmented like even a
highlight but the bronzer shade is again
a really light one so if you're if you
are more into a deeper one and you'd
need something I don't know that this
will work for you the contour really is
a nice grey so no this is an amazing
palette for six dollars it's kind of
unbelievable how good this is very
reminiscent of the bronze booster but
this one is more than half the price so
I would say this is an awesome deal
especially if you don't have any
bronzers yet or you do want to have kind
of a mix they're amazing you can take
these and pop them out and like if you
have their blush palette or their cream
one if you wanted to mix and match you
totally can they just pop right out
which i think is really cool I mean
again for a six dollar palette to be
that customizable I think that's really
neat and I think these stay on really
well throughout the day - they don't
just wear off quickly they genuinely
have some good staying power
the last brands are going to mention is
from ELF it's not one of their I
actually just declutter some I had like
their duo that's powder and those are
really good too there's nothing wrong
with them but I decided though I never
was reaching for it but this one I love
it's their aqua beauty little blush and
bronzer duo so it's kind of a cream to
powder kind of a feel and really the
blush is good it really is but it's this
bronzer it is so reminiscent of the
Chanel here I'll show you
it is so reminiscent of this Chanel
really expensive bronzer that I love
their Universal bronzer so good yeah
it's so so similar and this one fish you
know one's a little bit maybe lighter if
you just grab like a stipple brush of
course that's a blush all over it but
and just stippled it into the bronzer
and just stipple it on it is so
beautiful so natural looking it blends
so well into your found
that it just looks like it's actually
your skin and I think that's what's so
beautiful about that kind of a product
now we really wanted bronzer lasts all
day I would recommend put on the cream
bronzer and then take any of these
powder bronzers to put on top that's
going to seal it in and really make your
bronzer stay all day long but the duos
there are three different versions this
one's in the shade bronze pink beige
that they have two other versions and
they're all the same formula wonderful
wonderful product and it's only six
dollars so I would say the worst out of
all these would have to be just the
Revlon one I don't think it's worth that
price point unless you have like an
insane coupon or there's a crazy deal
that's the only one that I really feel
strongly that it's not really worth some
money but the rest of them really are
wonderful you can't go wrong with any of
them and always keep in mind you can
make any powder a bronzer by buying a
deeper shade now that doesn't mean it's
gonna last all day as long as something
that's meant to be a bronzer but
honestly like powder foundations
especially tend to last really long if
you can find a nice bronzer shade for
your skintone
that's going to be honestly your best
bet so hopefully this type of video was
helpful for you I linked and priced
everything down below if you were
curious about any of them I hopefully
you'll subscribe before you leave and
stick around and check more of my videos
out and I'll see you guys in my next one
