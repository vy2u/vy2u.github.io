going to be reviewing the new L'Oreal
infallible Pro contour powders they have
three different shades of this I bought
mine in the shade lights but they also
have medium and deep if you are
interested it comes with this little
brush it looks like a butterfly meant to
kind of apply it that way but let's go
ahead and get into the demo of me
applying this I am wearing it today and
then we'll get into the pros and cons of
this product I'm not gonna use the brush
that came with it you know the idea is
that you can just swipe right through
there and then you get your contour in
your hand in the right spot it might
work if the brush is so stiff it kind of
hurts my skin so I'm gonna use the
normal brushes I always use I love using
this bare essentials handy Buki I've had
this forever so I'm going to use that in
the contour shade and I'm gonna get
enough on there and just kind of tap a
little bit off and then I'm just I'm
just gonna place it where I want it so
you can already see there's a decent
amount of pigment to it when you just
place it right on then I'm gonna kind of
wipe off what was on the brush and then
just kind of really softly I like to do
circular motions just kind of blend it
you don't want to go too far in you
don't want to go too far up and you
don't want to go too far down so just
kind of right in the area you'd already
put it in so I actually think this is a
decent decent shade for if you're like
my skin tone kind of light medium I'm
very picky about contour shades I love
the Kevin of Kwan medium one and I feel
like it is very similar to that so I'm
again just kind of placing it wiping off
so it's on the brush then so the good
news is of course I placed a lot on
there I know that today I'm gonna be
filming videos so I want it to be just a
little bit harsher than an everyday look
not harsh harsh you guys know what I
mean but I think for everyday if you
just get a little less on your brush
maybe even tap off
not just in the air but on like a paper
towel or something and then place it in
it's gonna be a little bit lighter as
well so I'm gonna put a matte blush on
just so that it doesn't mess with the
highlight I want you to be able to see
what the highlight does so I'm gonna use
this is I've had this for literally
years this is from the balm in the shade
down boy
one of my favorite blushes and one of
the first blushes I own before I started
a channel so this is very pigmented so
you do have to kind of DAP off a lot o
DAP yeah sure DAP off so just you just
blending it back into that contour
mm-hmm you guys know I'm not a makeup
artist so it ain't gonna be perfect I
just love this shade it's just such a
nice light pink I'll link it below
since I'm mentioning it I just think
it's pretty okay so let's move on
so the highlight shade I'm just gonna
use this is an elf brush I will link the
name of it doesn't say the name it's one
of their new ones though and I've been
trying it out with highlight and I
really like it so I'm gonna get that
yellowy highlight shade I'm gonna get
plenty on there to tap some off then I'm
just gonna place it where I want it and
then just start kind of blending it I
kind of like to blend mine down just a
little bit into that blush area to make
it kind of look glistening because I
typically wear a shimmery blush anyway
as like shimmery blushes so this does
have some sheen to it I mean it is a
highlight but it's not like over the top
you know what I mean I think it's just a
really nice shade actually it's not
blini but it does bring a little bit of
light to that area so right off the bat
the packaging and this is I like that
it's got a mirror however I wish that
you know the brush I'm not a big fan of
it's nice when you're in a pinch or if
you're not you know I'm a makeup junkie
so I have brushes for this but
know that not everyone does so for that
purpose it's nice that it comes with
something however I almost wish it just
came with just the powder and then it
just closed because this is so much
wasted plastic it's such a big thing for
something that's just that but
shallowness aside I actually really like
these powders especially the contour I
think the highlight is nice but it's not
anything to write home about but I
really like the contour shade I've been
wearing it for a couple weeks and I've
noticed that throughout a long work day
it stays where it is and I keep you know
every time I'll get in my car at the end
of the work day I'll look and think no
way it's still gonna be there and it
always this now it might be a little bit
not as perfect I was gonna say splotchy
but it's not really splotchy it's not as
perfect as when I originally applied it
which I would say none of my makeup is
but it does stay in place now keep in
mind I'm typically wearing this with
like a setting spray on top so I think
that does help with the longevity of it
but I was very impressed if you haven't
tried me contour palette this is a nice
one to try you know it's no frills which
I kind of like because I think some
contour palette come with so many
different things you're like I'm never
gonna use all this I can't travel with
it because it's this big kit you know I
like that about this the price point is
a little students $12.99 which I think
for what this is it should be maps $8.99
because it's not I mean it's just two
different powders and it's not even like
a big pan of both it's like a triangle
of both so if I were to have designed
this they would have been to separate
shades not in this triangle I don't like
that but that aside if that would make
it easier to get your brush into it as
well but clearly this was designed to go
with the brush that comes with my final
verdict on this it's nice will I
continue to use it yes will I probably
use it till it's used up maybe the
contour shade probably not the highlight
because I've got many other drugstore
highlights that I like so much more than
this that I just I don't see myself
reaching for that but the contour
actually do like so I would say this is
for someone that maybe you don't already
have a contour powder and you have a
coupon for L'Oreal or there's a sale
this would be a great choice again the
deepest shade is not that deep so you
know the shade range is not very
extensive by any means but I hate when I
agree reviews like this where I'm kind
of wishy-washy where I don't it's not
like the most amazing thing I've ever
tried but it's not terrible so I just
feel wishy-washy and I hate presenting
that's you guys because I feel like I'm
like failing you I need like a
definitive but that's just how I feel
about it
hopefully you found this review helpful
and if you are interested in my other
drugstore reviews of oh so many other
drugstore makeup products I will link my
playlist below I hope that you'll
subscribe and catch my other makeup
videos and I'll catch you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
