share with you guys my picks for my
favorite drugstore priced Beauty gifts
gift sets gift ideas etc everything that
I mentioned in this video will be linked
below I'm so excited to announce as I
always tell you right at the beginning
that this video is sponsored by nug who
is one of my favorite brands I've worked
with them this might be the third time
I've worked with them you have amazing
skincare I've been using their masks for
probably a year now and I use probably
at least one a week if not more I love
them my husband uses them now my first
pick is their winter glow kit the reason
I love this set is because it's six face
masks and you get two of three different
kinds that make six so you get two of
the hydrating masks and I love that one
because for me I've got dry patches in
the winter like right here and here I
just let it sit on my skin soak in and
it just feels so amazing so hydrated and
I feel like when I use one of those
masks especially if I use it the night
before the next day when I the next day
when I wake up my foundation goes onto
so much more smoothly and so that is a
big deal to me so that you also get the
revitalizing and the exfoliating masks
I just love switching between these they
also have these cute little two packs
that I remember even last year at
Christmas I ended up gifting to some of
my siblings you could buy these
individually and put them in stockings
for a bunch of different people these
would be great gifts for your child's
teacher I'm a teacher I would freak out
if someone brought this to me I mean
they're it's one of those things that
everyone would use these if they had
them and I think people don't think to
buy them for themselves you know what I
mean so awesome awesome skin care
awesome brand I love it so the next item
I wanted to bring up this kind of blew
me away this was from Ulta and it's
their hashtag fab haves and it is six
items this was $15 and it says it's a
$45 value and in it it's got the Loreal
infallible setting spray now it's not
the full size it's a smaller size but it
also has the Maybelline lash sensational
mascara the soap &amp;amp; Glory pillow plump
lip gloss which is really nice that
gives like a tingling effect on your
lips has all may I make a room
her paths the essence make me brow
eyebrow gel and then the NYX pore filler
primer so this is one of those things
that if you know someone likes makeup
maybe it's someone in high school or you
know like I think of I've got some anis
that she's at an age where I'm like I
don't really know what to buy for you
know she's kind of you know in that teen
early teen years this might be something
she would use so if you've got someone
like that in your life or just someone
you know loves makeup this is a great
foolproof gift it's got things that
anyone could use and it's just awesome
and these are good products in here as
well so I thought that was such a cool
thing and I'd never seen these Ulta
before so the next item is this bath
bomb set and it's from the brand fizz
and bubble and it's their assorted
holiday bath truffle collection clearly
these look like a bunch of little
truffles but they're bath bombs I am so
excited to give these a try this as one
honestly I bought for myself because I
was like I'm treating myself treat
yo'self and this was too cute to pass up
I've never seen anything so cute in my
life so but if you know someone likes
baths or maybe you're a husband and
you're you know or maybe you want to ask
for it for yourself I cannot wait to try
these I've heard really good things
about the fizz and bubble brand and to
have you know nine of them oh my gosh
but it's really it's genuinely making me
hungry for sweets
oh my gosh this would even be great for
you know like someone in college you
know if they do have a bathtub like I
know for me in my dorm we did and that
was rare but if they do have a bathtub
if they're in college you know when
they've had a stressful night or
whatever this is would be an awesome
gift for someone in college as well
there are two items from soap &amp;amp; Glory
they actually sent me a while ago and I
wanted to point them out because I saw
these at Ulta as well so you can buy
them there this is their roll with it
original pink rollerball and it's
clearly like you know you could hang it
on the tree like a little ornament type
thing but I've heard a lot of people
really like this fragrance and it's a
really big rollerball so I'm excited to
give this a try just a really nice sweet
smell it has like a hint maybe a floral
but not really I know I wouldn't call it
musky at all just kind of a sweet fresh
scent which I like again you know I
think of people that work you know like
if they're Fitness people they might
like to throw this in there gym bag
again college-age is always good just a
really nice one and that rollerball is
gonna last awhile because that's
actually pretty big
they also sent this which is another
woman you could you know like a little
ornament cute gift set this is their
best-selling hand food so many people
love the hand food and I've actually
never tried it and then this is their
heel genius foot cream and you know in
the wintertime you might have you might
be more prone to dry skin so this is
awesome to travel sized as well but I
just think it's they're really all of
their products seem to be really really
good especially promotions the next
thing would be another great stocking
stuffer this is from a OS they had a
like maybe three different gift sets but
this is actually the smallest of their
gift sets and it just got two of their
iOS lip balms and say the flavors yes so
the white one is vanilla bean and the
red one is winter berry and I
these are nice lip balms I wouldn't say
that they're my favorite for a long time
I really liked the sweet mint one but
I've kind of grown out of it I just
realized you know there are way more
moisturizing products out there but
again if you've got a middle schooler a
high schooler even college age and they
just like you know really simple quick
lip balms that smell nice and they're
kind of cute this would be perfect and
they have bigger gift sets as well if
you know someone's like obsessed with
lip balm this next item is a body shop
one this one was ten dollars and it came
with they had a lot of body shop gift
sets at Ulta this is their vanilla chai
body butter and their vanilla chai
shower gel this is one of those things
that I love things like this oh and it
comes with a little loofah in the back
as well I love things like this during
the holidays even if you just buy it for
yourself because if you travel during
the holidays I like having having
holiday scents with me to use such a
nice scent and the body shop body
butters are to die for they're so
moisturizing in the winter time so I
love this and I thought that was a
reasonable price for this set speaking
of wintery kind of holiday type sense I
could not pass this up this is from the
Ulta beauty brand and I really very
rarely buy things for that brand not
really for any reasons but I don't hear
a lot said about it but this one caught
my eye they had these three-in-one
smoothies and it's you know obviously
got a little pump they're nice size and
they had three different kind of holiday
scents but this one reminded me of let
me smell it again
yes it smells like vanilla bean Noel
which is
favorite holiday Senate Bath Body Works
but I've kind of you know I haven't
bought a lot of that well you can't buy
it during the year but last year I don't
think I bought any of it I don't even
know if they I think they had it last
year but I loved it I love the candles
and things like that but this one smells
honestly I think maybe even better it's
in this scent marshmallow fluff and I
love that it's got kind of that pearly
look to it I'm planning on using this as
like a bubble bath kind of a thing the
idea is that it's a body wash bubble
bath and a shampoo I probably won't use
it as a shampoo I would use it as a body
wash as well and I just love having
something holiday scents it in my shower
to use just to get me in the mood every
single morning when I use it next gift
idea this set of dry shampoos if you are
new to the world of dry shampoos batiste
is really really good and really
reasonably priced for the quality now
there are now a ton of dry shampoos at
the drugstore I've tried I think
honestly all of them and batiste really
is the best in the drugstore and really
the best compared to a lot of high-end
ones as well so it comes with their
blush original and tropical and that
that's the scent they all are the same
you know they all have the white kind of
white cast but then you can brush it out
I use dry shampoo every other day
because they don't wash my hair every
day so when I don't I typically am using
dry shampoo today I actually use dry
shampoo but this is amazing this is an
amazing set for me really just thinking
from a travels standpoint I use dry
shampoo like crazy when I travel and I
very rarely actually check a bag so
these are awesome for that if you do
know someone that likes to travel or if
you know they love dry shampoo awesome
stocking stuffer awesome gifts the next
thing is this little perfume set from
Pacifica now Pacifica a lot of people
love their sense but from what I've
heard and I actually have not smelled
these yet I bought these on a whim
because I have heard that so many people
love the sense but they are very parts
very specific sense so this is the
Indian coconut nectar we're gonna smell
this one but I I think it's cool it's
the set of three again and they're all
separately in separate boxes so you
could split it up for stockings you
could just gift it all whatever boo that
one that reminds me I think I've had
facial wipes of theirs with this scent
very coconutty very coconut either
is so cute - Pacifica really kills it
with packaging so the next one is
sugared amber dreams oh this one smells
like cake but not too much so but it
definitely has that kind of bakery good
smell like that I think I like that
better than the other one but I like
that kind of a scent and then the last
cent is Tahitian gardenia gardenia
however you say it this one's got more
of a greenish yellow tint to it Wow
definitely a gardenia kind of scents so
if you like it's not even call it floral
it well I guess it is but it's a very
specific scent so if you like or Dina
you would like it all of them smell good
though but like I said all three of them
are very very different so you could
split these up
I just think look at the packaging of
these even the box that came in is just
ridiculously beautiful the next gift
idea is this Turbie twist now I know
this might be a weird thing to mention
but I have used it doesn't have to be
like the turban choice right but I've
used towels like this for my hair for
six years maybe even longer and so I
replaced it from sight from time to time
but I thought it was cool that it came
with the shower cap as well so you've
got the actual like Turbie twist you you
basically tie your hair in it it really
is kind of turbine light and then
there's like a little elastic string
that you can stick it into in the back
so that it stays and I use it every time
that I shower I have a black one
currently and actually I think it's from
nume or something like that it's not
even this brand right now but then it
also has a little shower cap for when
it's a dry day where you're not washing
your hair but you want a shower so I
thought this is a really cool combo set
and this one was only $6.99 so it's not
a super pricey gift but it's one that is
useful it's useful if you have again a
college student that's living on their
own this would be a really cool gift
that it's one that you don't think about
if you've never used it but it is
incredibly helpful and I think that
makes for good gift giving I also want
to plug my upcoming or maybe it's
already up so I'll link it below if it
started up when you're watching this my
target dollar spot Paul I got a huge bag
filled with all kinds of different gift
ideas and things that are you know most
of them
some of them $3 amazing stuff I don't
want to show you too much cuz I want to
run the video but I will link that below
if it's already up I was so surprised by
how many amazing gift things and also
just things you know to decorate your
own house to decorate you know your
little if you work in a cubicle or at a
desk to decorate that as well even have
really good candles there other than
that like I said I hope you'll subscribe
to catch more of my videos and I will
