another drugstore haul I feel like I
always get on a kick and it happens a
couple times a year where like I do one
drugstore haul and then I'm like oh my
gosh and I it's like I've gotten bit by
a bug and then I go like within the next
month or two like 5 million times and
every time I go end up getting way too
much but there's so many products that
either I haven't been able to find until
now or they're just ones that I'm like
oh that looks new or oh I like that
shape
there's no excuse so let's go ahead and
start I there are so many things that
like ok let's start with what's on my
lips because these I'm actually trying
for the very first time these have been
around for a little while these are the
maybelline color blurs and right now I'm
wearing number 45 I'm blushing and these
are just a really matte creamy thin
formula and I really like it because
it's eat I mean it glides on so smooth
like it's ridiculous I've never quite
felt anything like this but it's got
it's not really pointed anymore but it's
enough that I can I didn't end up using
a lip liner today I'm able to still kind
of line my lips well enough with it but
the idea is that you kind of blur it out
I just put it on I mean you can blur it
out but I don't know that I'll use it
that way the other shade I got I'm
really excited about is number 15 Berry
misbehaved kit see they do come this one
I haven't really used this one does come
with a little bit of a point but this
one's more of obviously a berry color I
would consider it like a berry tone it's
close to red but with that blue ship to
it which is my favorite so these will
definitely be worn so far of its I've
been wearing it today it feels like it
hasn't moved I've only been wearing it I
mean maybe for an hour so I don't really
know but I just like the how they feel
comfortable I'm drinking some Pellegrino
I'm swaying in here right now and you
can see there's a little bit of
transfers of lipstick on there but not
so much like I'm wearing a vivid
lipstick that comes right off so these
might be a really good like daily thing
to you so I will have to get back to you
on
next thing I got which were brand new to
me these are the wet and wild geometric
highlighting powders I had never seen
these never heard about them so this
one's in Sun ceremony and it's just so
open it says these are limited edition
and a lot of times they put limited
edition things and white packaging I've
noticed I think just to kind of
differentiate between them so this one
you think would be kind of yeah more of
a golden toned highlight they're really
nice and pigmented on your finger but
they kind of are more sheared out when
you swatch it which I mean that's kind
of what I want with a highlighter I've
worn both of these I think if I remember
right I liked the gold one a little bit
better with my skin tone but the other
one that has a little bit more of a rosy
hue is called desert exploration so this
one has more of a pink pull to it and
again it swatches okay but not you know
it's not like some highlighters that are
out there that are like eyeshadows
almost these really do sheer out when
you apply them but I apply them with a
brush of course not my fingers so I feel
like they were nice I wouldn't say it's
like oh my gosh you'd have to run out
and buy these right now but only use
them a couple of times they're nice do
you see them and you need a new
highlighter you want to try something
new I think they're worth a try
alright here are some things from Milani
that I've been dying to get my hands on
one of them is the Milani moisture lock
rosehip oil infused lip treatment I've
seen a lot of people talking about these
I'm like I'm gonna try one mine's in the
pink one I don't know
oh it's called 0-5 repairing primrose
now these have a this one at least has a
rosy scent for sure and it's clear for
the most part it does have that pink
tint but it doesn't really come across
and the applicator is kind of like a doe
foot applicator but it's just like a
little bit bigger and thicker which i
think is kind of fun it really is clear
when you apply it but it just feels nice
a lot of times I'll put it on instead of
like my lip balm I'll put this on while
I'm getting ready that's how I've used
it actually the two times
and I liked it I don't know how
moisturizing it truly is it feels
moisturizing but I feel like this is one
of those things that I need to try for a
while before I can say yes it's great
for your lips I don't know but I think
it's cute this is kind of one of those
things I'm like this is perfect to have
in your purse at all times I got this
shirt by the way at Sam's Club they have
clothes like in the middle it's kind of
like Costco but Walmart's version and I
was like this is really cute they have a
different few different colors I was
like I kind of want two of them but I
only got one all right next thing I
actually bought kind of by mistake let
me explain so this is the Physicians
Formula super bee bee all-in-one beauty
balm compact cream I don't know what I
thought this was I was looking for what
some of you guys had told me I was
looking for a dupe for my it cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination
powder foundation it's ridiculous names
but it's my favorite thing ever because
it's a powder foundation that has really
high coverage but it doesn't make your
skin look black it looks just really
nice and kind of like satin well you
guys recommend one from Physicians
Formula and I could not remember what it
was called so I thought it was this as I
opened it when I got back that night I
was like wait a minute this is like an
actual is this the what I think it was
like an actual cream I was like boom so
yeah it's like a I don't want to swatch
it because I do when I am in a returning
it but it's like a cream type situation
also the color way more on what she did
I get I got enlightened medium thinking
with the powder it's not as obvious and
it might make me look a little bronzy if
it's just a little too dark but with the
cream like this so really cute packaging
than I am in a take it back so if you
know what one maybe you were one of the
few subscribers that recommended a
certain powder foundation type thing
from Physicians Formula please let me
down below because I really do want to
buy it and I want to buy the right one
next time alright next thing I finally
got my hands on these these are the
other Milani thing these are their eyes
shadow collections that their everyday
eyes this one is in 0-2 bare necessities
and this is actually what I'm wearing on
my eyes today I'm wearing this kind of
deeper bronze color all over the lid and
just blend it up into the crease and
then I use the matte color here to kind
of blend that out a little bit and then
I use this color this ivory color on my
brow bone it might be a little too shiny
but I'm like kind of digging it right
now um these are ridiculously amazing
you guys I've heard like good things but
people should be gushing more because
these aren't ridiculous the packaging is
actually like not flimsy like it's a
thicker plastic this next one's in
must-have naturals and oh my gosh this
middle color right here is so beautifu
gonna swatch some of these so it does
kick up some powder but if you blow it
off then there's nothing to worry about
oh my gosh I love it's kind of like a
shimmery taupe I love let me swatch the
one I'm wearing on my lids today as well
it's kind of bronzy color from the first
palette they do kick up powder like I
said but really it's worth working with
for the payoff and they blend gorgeously
the colors they paired together are so
beautiful they all have enough matte
like in the second palette I showed you
there's a matte black a matte kind of
cool brown a matte ivory I mean they
have just enough matte shadows to make
these work so beautifully together
I am so in love with them the last thing
I've got is something that I actually
bought the fibers version and I've tried
it a couple times some like I don't
really love this it might need some time
to kind of dry out but this is the
original super sizer and I had it a
while ago but I ended up giving it away
without trying it I think because I had
like so many mascaras and I was
overwhelmed
I think one of my sisters needed it so I
gave I passed on I regretted it
eventually because I saw so many people
on YouTube raving about the original
super sizer mascara and I'm like man so
I've got to try it people are like
swearing by it so I'm very excited
because I'm in love with the Lancome is
it the Hypnose star that Hypnose drama
won and it's so expensive for a mascara
I hate spending that kind of money on it
so I'm like if I can find one that does
the same thing at sets of the drugstore
obviously and cheaper than I'm all that
so I am so excited to try this out let
me know like if you've tried this is
this the kind of formula where it does
need some time to kind of dry out before
it really performs well or is it the
kind of right out of the bottle it's
amazing I'm always curious about that so
that was everything that I bought at the
drugstore I think I feel like every time
I film one of these I do my makeup the
next day and say oh my gosh I also got
this lipstick and I totally forgot but I
really think that was everything I got
this trip let me know if there's
anything out there in the drugstore
right now that you're dying for me to
review or try out or swatch or if it's
something that maybe I've never
mentioned that I've never tried I'd be
curious too as well so I hope that
you'll subscribe to catch more of them
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
