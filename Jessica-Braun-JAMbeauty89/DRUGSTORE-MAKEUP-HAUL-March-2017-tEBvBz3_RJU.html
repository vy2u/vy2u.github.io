to share with you another drugstore haul
like the more I think about my pal hope
you already bought it out much more
makeup and I already have and I've
already tried it all out for a week
so somebody send help please some help
okay so I bought yet another drugstore
foundation I'm on a freaking roll
spending all my money on drugstore
foundations but there are so many good
ones out there and so many new ones so
I'm just like dying to try all of them
so I've just gone crazy but this one's
actually been out for a little while
it's the Milani nope Maybelline fit me
foundation but it's the dewy and smooth
I tried the matte and poreless
it was just not for me I don't really
like mattifying foundations on my dry
skin I like this one it's not my
favorite
I think the shade match is actually
pretty good this one's in 120 classic
ivory I found that it's kind of a more
neutral bordering on yellow kind of a
tone but I hate the packaging of this
honestly even like the let me grab it
the wet-and-wild photo focus like this
one has this like weird paddle and it
kind of was weird but I would prefer
this over just having to dump it out or
like for me I'll take it because it's
just been opening and like shake it like
this and might get it on my finger and
use that but I hate it and it just gets
everywhere and I don't care how shallow
that sounds I don't like it I don't know
why they're still packaging things like
this why not put a pump on it or
something anyway and yeah I know you can
buy different pumps for different sized
bottles I've done that in the past but I
just realized I'm like you know it's not
worth spending the extra money I'll just
use the product but it is stressful
regardless so I do feel like this looks
the best with a beauty blender with a
brush it just kind of brushes all around
with your fingers it's alright but a
beauty blender does do a pretty good job
I don't think it's super high coverage
but it does have a nice natural finish I
want to use it some more before I really
kind of give you my true thoughts but
I'm realizing it's just not it's not a
foundation like I don't look at my skin
and think ooh because there are some
foundations that I also my skin three
hours into work and I think blue that
looks terrible it's not like that it
looks nice on my skin I just don't think
it's like the best at the drugstore I
bought a bunch of essence products I
feel like they there's a store near me
called Meyer if you live in the Midwest
you probably have one and they just
recently started carrying essence ones
like oh now because otherwise I go you
know to buy them online or go to an
Alton there's not an Ulta super close to
me it's not that far but I don't go that
often because I get myself in trouble my
too much makeup anyway so I wanted to
try some new products so I've got some
crummy ones let's start with a crummy
one this is the essence say no to
redness and I thought perfect I've got
red cheeks I sometimes on redness here
so I've used this a bit and it really is
truly a green formula you know I mean
it's a green product here's the thing
guys though it doesn't really blend in
well and you know you don't have to
blend it in all the way because you're
going to put foundation on top of it and
you're really trying to cover redness
that can be nice except for the
Greenwood peeps through so I blend it in
more and it would just it just looked
weird like it just added like weird
texture to my skin and it just didn't
look good like I would rather some
redness show through than what this
looked like it just looks like a weird
cakey mess foundation would get like
stuck on it but not in a good way and
I've tried this in quite a few ways with
different foundations different things
it's just it's a bill pass so no no no
no no next essence product is their
camouflage cream concealer I got it in
the shade natural beige and I think the
packaging is so cute you know you just
open it top and it's got two different
tones so one's a little more yellow and
ones well just a little bit more deep
kind of um they watch okay but I tried
it under my eye in hated it like it
really
I couldn't blend it like it was just
kind of just there so then I tried it on
like blemishes and it did okay
again I it was just okay I did I will
say it was creamier than a lot that I've
tried at this price point
the second shades a little bit too deep
for me so I will say if you're going to
buy this definitely more for covering
blemishes not for under-eye which is how
most products like this they really
don't work great on your under-eye
unless it's like an amazing formula not
my favorite but not the worst so it's
kind of a mess product if you set it
with like a loose setting powder that
does a really good job you've got a
blemish if you tap this around it and on
it and kind of blend it pretty well and
then you set it with a really good loose
setting powder it will stay in place
so for that I will say great on its own
it doesn't stay in place so you do have
to set it with something so the next
essence product I bought I must have got
the wrong one this is the essence lash
princess mascara a lot of you guys
recommended this but it must have been a
different they have like a few options
for last princess I must have gotten the
wrong one because this stuff I put it on
my lashes and I liked the brush and it
literally at the end I had three lashes
and I put on one coat like what is going
on so I'm like okay whatever so I can
finish the other eyes the same thing
just like really clumpy but not in a
good way because a little bit of
clumping can be good because it adds
volume no this looks crazy
so then the next day I try it again same
exact thing if you've tried this or
maybe it's a different one please let me
know did I buy the wrong one am i using
it wrong I don't know but the next
product is a repurchase this is the NYX
jumbo eye pencil and milk I forgot how
often this is I used it today it really
does such an amazing job of making your
I mean it Prime's your eyelids pretty
well but it's just such a good job of
being that white base to make your
eyeshadow really stand out what I
realized this is what I've been missing
in my routine because I feel like every
you know all these colors is kind of
blending together and it never really
looks that great but this has really
made a huge difference for me so I just
take it put it all over my eyelid blend
it in from my brow bone all the way to
my lashline and it just such a great
job I can't believe test two if it helps
prevent creasing I feel like I remember
a lot of people back in the day saying
that it didn't do a great job of that I
don't know because I don't really have
that problem on that same token I bought
another Maybelline Color tattoo and it's
in the shade too cool and the reason I
bought it was for that same reason I
wanted to use this as an eyeshadow base
just like the NYX but the thing is this
is really it does have like a sheen
there's like actual glitter in this and
so I used it once all over like brow
bone too and I was like oh this is
glittery so it didn't look bad but it
wasn't really ideal for what I wanted it
for so I mean you can see it blended
really well it's a pretty color but I'm
not going to use it for that so like I
might use it just on my lid but at that
point why not just use the next one and
do it all over so the only thing the
formula was fine the color is pretty but
it's not quite what I just I don't want
to just use it just as a cream eyeshadow
so I don't know how much more use I'm
going to get out of this this is kind of
like should have done my research next
product I love this thing this totally
took me by surprise this is the Revlon
Ultra HD lipstick and it didn't number
700hp
sand now I tried their like ones that
were the smaller ones I don't know that
that was the same formula or it was the
same product
these are way better I hated those old
ones with the pass you did a whole video
about it about like a year maybe even
two years ago this is like a comfortable
you can see it's kind of like a satin
but very moisturizing you know kind of a
finish I love this shade I've been
wearing it every day at work like I just
grab it throw it on it looks so great
you don't really need a mirror lip line
or anything like this I don't know about
the other shades is the only one I
bought but I love it oh my gosh because
it's not I have pigmented lips as it is
and I feel like every time I get like a
nude it either is way too light or it's
just way too deep this is right in
between it's perfect
perfect this product I bought from ELF
it's there
expert liquid liner and I feel like so
many people use this and I I feel like I
remember trying it a long time ago but I
haven't a while it's one of those brush
tips I don't love brush tips I would
rather have felt tips however brush tips
are really good out like if you're
wearing fake lashes like I'm wearing
fake lashes today really good at
painting over it and if you've seen my
recent videos where I'm wearing
different fake lashes it was a really
thick lash band and you can see the lash
band as I'm editing all those videos and
like oh my gosh like it was driving me
crazy and I know it was driving some of
you guys crazy what was driving me just
as crazy think what could have helped
that is a better liquid liner that like
the felt tips are great but for
something like that they don't do a
great job but this really is almost like
painting your you know your lash line so
I think this would have been better but
those lashes just had way too thick of a
a band anyway this stuff is really nice
it's really black I mean it doesn't
budge too much I've only used it a
couple times like I said it's not my
favorite format for everyday but it is
really good if you really want but
you've got a practice because you can
get it era where era we're speaking of
else I also they actually sent these to
me they send me a lot of things I don't
always show it but these I wanted to
show because they're new and really cool
these are their new elf like lips tinted
and so there's four shades that I have
this one's in red kiss and these are
just like these really comfortable truly
just oils they have a little tint of
color to them but like looking at this
you think oh it's going to be super red
no it's like a nice very light wash of
color but the idea is that they're
really moisturizing good for your lips
this next one is in coral kiss again you
think it's going to be like bright coral
the applicator is really interesting
it's like a little chair you can see
that but coral kiss is right there and
then the next one the next two are my
favorites this one's pink kiss and this
one has a lot more pigment to it which I
thought was kind of interesting I mean I
guess it's not that much more but I
think it's a lot more but it's a really
pretty like bluish
and then this one's a nude kiss is this
the one I was wearing at work the other
day I think so I really like these last
few shades again they seem almost more
like lip gloss like because what crazy
is this red one is the one that has the
least pigment and it's not super red so
it really is kind of interesting but I
would really recommend these last two I
think they're so beautiful they're so
your lips look so healthy and plump
they're not I don't think they're
plumping but they just look healthy and
juicy and it's really comfortable to
wear so these are one of those things
that tinted oils are kind of becoming
bigger and bigger I'm noticing
especially in the drugstore too and so
these I like the packaging it's kind of
bigger it reminds me of kind of sizable
eyes buxom lip glosses in a way but I
really I was very impressed with these
and like I said I would recommend this
last two so those are all of the new
items I have recently bought from the
drugstore I feel like I keep doing
drugstore haul like I I can't even keep
up with myself I can't film it fast
enough before I buy like a ton more but
it's just that season of new launches
new amazing products so I have also
filmed today a wet and wild best worth
what's new from what wild and the same
thing for Milani so if those are up I
will link them below if they're not stay
tuned because there's so many amazing
new products from both of those lines so
many that I did separate videos instead
of including them with this anyway but I
was so impressed with so much and it's
really just so exciting because they're
all so cheap I hope that you'll
