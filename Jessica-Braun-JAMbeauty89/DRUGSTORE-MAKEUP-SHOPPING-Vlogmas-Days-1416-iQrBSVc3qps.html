morning Tyler Tyler was out on a run
while I was getting ready and I could
not figure out where that sound was
coming from
why didn't I check the battery well I've
never heard that alarm yeah because I
usually have my iPhone on it and it
plays music but since my dad yeah that's
funny and this will needy puppy anyway
so I'm almost ready to go and then
today's day one of Secret Santa at
school so I'm excited for the things
that I got my Secret Santa I always love
this time of year and it's like spirit
week so today's like school spirit day I
got a look at what the rest of the week
is and we I've got two holiday parties
this week one it
Tyler's dad's company's holiday party
and then our staffs holiday party on
Thursday so there's a lot coming up but
it's gonna be really fun so I'm just so
excited for I love these kinds of weeks
okay I feel like I had the same reaction
under school everyday but I mean so
school's out and on Mondays we actually
get out a little bit earlier well that
Suns like looking awesome right now
anyway and our Township that I work for
actually has like once a month or every
other month this place you can go and
get a bunch of free stuff and you can
only go like when it's your day and it's
our schools day and you can get like
they usually have folder or school
supplies but also just like use stuff
like use books they'll have like
classroom organization things so it's
our schools day today so I'm gonna go
and take advantage of it cuz I haven't
gone in a few months and I'm like we
really need folders and notebooks and
I'm just wanting to reorganize my
classroom and I switched grades last
year and this year I'm hoping next year
to just stay in fifth grade I love fifth
grade so assuming I'm staying I want to
like take the time to really be
thoughtful about the way I'm organizing
everything so that it's more useful to
me I feel like I've I'm finally figuring
out the way I like things and the way
things need to be for the classroom just
to run smoothly so anywho so I'm excited
to go there and then I've got to go to
the store to get some things for my
students for Christmas and just other
things so so that was awesome I got a
like a whole class set of folders brand
new folders and cute little tea tree
stamps and what else that I get scissors
we needed scissors so badly I think the
student my students are eating the
scissors like where are they going
we really needed pencils they didn't
have any but that's fine but they had a
lot of awesome stuff so I was so excited
to get some new like little things like
I needed a nice stapler remover and they
had some ones that clearly they were
probably from like retired teachers but
they were really nice ones like you know
back when they used to make things to
last and not like to break in a year so
you have to buy a pen so I am so excited
about that and you'll be happy to know
if you watch my other vlog missus that I
got some staplers so I thought that was
pretty funny
so I'm at Meijer I might need to buy
this nail polish do you guys see how
beautiful
it's called Showtime I'm buying it what
I have to buy it now these little
cushions on Nations like what I'm
obviously buying this and these too
oh my gosh so am I the only person in
the world I love going to like the
travel toiletries when I know I'm going
on a trip and half the time I don't need
anything and don't buy anything because
I already have it but I just love
looking at it so we just got the mail
and make it forever just sent me some of
their ultra HD foundations and I was
tellin time I was like tired you don't
know how big of a deal this is because
this was the foundation just this past
summer that I like saved up for to buy
so that I could wear it on my wedding
day so and I like research tim is trying
to find the right shade in the end I
still need in wonderment anyway but they
reformulated it so they don't sell that
exact formulation anymore anyway but
they sent me that in their primers so
I'm interested to try some of these I'm
hoping they're silicone free just
because I'm realizing that some of the
silicone primers break me out but
regardless this is awesome
I'm so excited Tyler are you excited oh
my gosh so my brother for christmas got
is this Bialetti espresso maker or
coffee maker and we have one here that's
this little one the size but my Italian
foreign exchange student brought us this
one to make espresso in and then we have
this one it's the same brand see that's
actually what Italians used so that's
pretty cool but we would make espresso
in this Jessica and I would and we could
only do one espresso at a time and so
we'd have to make it wait for it to cool
down clean it out restart it and redo it
again so right so we never had high so
we got this one and we're so excited I
Chi said you can use this pressure or
coffee and it's just on the stovetop so
if we're about to try it for the first
time
thank you
it's not like old stuff top percolators
used to work so you put your water in
the bottom here and then your little
filter dude goes there coffee goes on
top of that and this is espresso though
this is espresso yeah that we're making
right now I mean that it's actually
espresso ground right exactly so six in
there right so we haven't logged it all
today right no my well I couldn't my
like cord for my phone is broken so I
couldn't take the videos off and I only
have like eight or eight gigs on my
phone or something so the video I
couldn't delete long story short we have
the name of the blog yet today so really
kind of there's phone we got a blogger
we got a blog Lee vlog what did you say
in this luckily vlogger vloggy vlogmas
that's good something like that
you know so we're going to your dad's
companies yeah what you've worked for
him this year you do every year for
there yeah actually what is it it's
funny because it's in January so I
worked for him in January and then I get
invited to the holiday party in the at
the end of the year because I work for
him in January it works it's always fun
so we're excited to go it was awesome we
are tired we're gonna go to bed
it was really an enjoyable night though
and we got to chat with people we didn't
know very well which is always kind of
fun he needs it it sounds weird we get
to practice like your social skills
which was kind of nice so we're gonna go
to bed Tyler's about to come in any
minute you say can pinocchio out right
now but um I've got two more days of
teaching and I've got books to level so
you'll see that I've got some if you
know anything about leveling books I've
got some colored stickers to level like
what grade level or whatever the books
are at so yeah that's gonna be my Friday
this week which is gonna be awesome
we're guys so I'm almost done getting
ready but I'm sad this morning because I
have been loving well here let me flip
the camera around so this mica beauty
gel liner I love it's really like creamy
and stuff but it's almost gone I don't
know if it's enough to bring moving to
London I don't want to run out I mean I
could just buy a new one there and who
knows I probably will but regardless so
I was thinking okay I need
find a gel eyeliner to pack for that
here in a couple days and I was like oh
I have half of a L'Oreal one still here
so I grabbed it but it is half my gone
which I knew but it's completely dried
out so like man so this one needs to go
but I love this stuff and I I might buy
this eventually but I have to do it
online and I don't want to risk it not
being here in time so I'm gonna have to
go to the store at some point over the
next few days and get another gel liner
I really liked the L'Oreal one but now
this one is it very I think they're very
different formulas and I like this
better it's creamier so I need to do
some research can I admit that most of
the way to work i sing disney princess
sing along songs they have so many of
like well they have so much karaoke on
like Spotify and Apple music so I just
search for my favorites and make
playlists and just like sing the whole
way to work because it's the easiest way
to wake up for me and also it's just fun
and puts me in a good mood I love it I'm
just singing almost there from Princess
and the Frog and another one I think
it's a Sleeping Beauty one I can't
remember what it was though oh no it was
Pocahontas colors of the wind that was
the other one I was singing today
awesome so I am just now leaving Target
I just forgot what I was doing I had to
get last-minute things like things I'm
using in my students little goodie bags
and things so I just left Target and it
was crazy they're crazy like they had no
shopping carts no shopping baskets
everything was being used up I'm looking
around I'm like today's Wednesday right

carrying around a bunch of little things

legs are so sore I did a kettlebell
