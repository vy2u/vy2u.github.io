something different I have this idea
this morning I want to do an anti haul
which I've done a couple of on my
channel usually I'm using Sephora or
Ulta as my kind of guide to like what is
new and then deciding what do I do not
want to buy what am I not interested in
what do I think is redundant and this
time I want to do a drugstore one which
you guys have asked me to do which I
thought that's an awesome idea because I
do so much drugstore I love drugstore
but there are some products I'm just not
interested in but I thought it'd be way
more fun if I brought you guys along
with me to the drugstore to go through
and show you what I'm not going to buy
where we get into it I hope that you
will subscribe and tap that little
notification bells you get alerted every
time a new video goes live on my channel
other than that let's go to the
drugstore okay so we're at Target
first thing I'm not buying this right
here in abscess alright got my heavy its
micellar water there are so many brands
that sell it $7 is actually not terrible
but I just never use it so for me I'm
like great another brand filling
micellar water class the other thing is
right next to this is the sweet cheeks
palette this is $20 20 dusters
$20 Knicks should not be charging $20
for anything they can't I just feel like
drugstores like creeping up and they're
like instructor but it's an $18 problem
like that you can't call it drive
somewhere that's half the price of food
anyway but it's just a blush palette
I'll never use it it was the only blush
columns I can't travel with it so here's
something else later and this I'm only
bringing up here to have a future right
here which says old Jessica with the
clearance and I would just buy it
regardless of if I genuinely needed it
or wanted it but one like big thing at
least for me is like just because it's
on clearance a it's probably on clerical
reason but B doesn't mean you need it
because it's a good deal doesn't mean
you need to buy it because she's going
to sit there and you spent yes you spent
less money but on something that you're
never going to use so you might as well
not money at all saved it up for
something easy on you and they want so
that's a big lesson because I see
Claire's all the time and I always think
oh my in like there's another one right
there
sure sure there's another one right
there but if I'm never gonna use it why
would I even spend the that little bit
about money but although here's
something that is awesome these are
awesome part of me like I think I am
London left it's like the best highlight
ever thinking behind those but not today
not going to do it Susie I tried one of
the katie-cat man and it was terrible it
was drying it didn't be on so no I don't
want to hide a khf girl where it's
probably a very similar formula
different look I love that Katy Perry's
a part of it but I just think a product
is not very great and people are just
buying it for the name which I'm sure is
what covergirl is banking on
here we go regardless of the clearance I
haven't even heard of these and they're
already on clearance that's about time
but also I talked about lip Palace
before where I feel like one of those
things that it's a cool idea in theory
you have a bunch of colors but in
reality you'd never use it
I'd rather just grab a lipstick you're
not going to put that in your purse and
then reapply if you're mixing colors
you're not reapplying it throughout the
day zero Tyler a little bit prettier
what are we looking at Blues ideas now
this could work in theory but it would
be very tricky to make perfect what why
why not have a highlighter one of the
bombs on the other this is like their
catering to people that don't know what
they're doing but this would be
incredibly hard for someone that doesn't
know what they're doing to pull off I
just think that's an insane idea I don't
set something no way not by now there's
not a blush palette frankly looks really
pretty because they're actually really
different but again horsebox
standby don't need it okay so this is a
wet oil brow lifter like little pencil I
feel like I've tried really expensive
versions of these and they'll be great
right under but then you have to blend
it down and it takes so much time that
you just like at the end of the day
you're like that was not worth it I
could have used a light powder shadow
and it would have been done basically
now if you're doing like prospected like
instagram-worthy
maybe but for me I'm like never doing
that so to me I'm like even really cheap
even super great not in the way for with
Sonia Kashuk brush sets they always have
different ones always and the steps are
never as good as you'd find the brushes
individually and while you might save
money like getting something like this
the brushes down here
here we go see most of these crushes are
really really nice i really like these
brushes here that would be awesome for
highlight number 19 anyway they're
always really really nice ergonomic
little handles versus these these are
always the little tips they have are
always not nearly as good quality so i
always try to avoid even if they're on
clearance I tell myself no okay
is the first time seeing these melting
house clearly like the Too Faced melted
lip products the only thing is do we
need any more of these guys someone did
like an exact dupe for the cheap so now
more people are doing dupes which is
nice but I don't know actually I have
these colors I wouldn't wear so there's
like one I would wear and even that I
don't like it these are always really
sticky and uncomfortable and even the
two-faced ones which are the ones most
people want are really really sticky
also has anyone heard of this the
covergirl total tease look at the brush
I don't think so I feel like I could get
down with that side oh yeah I feel I get
down with that side it's not no I won't
ever use this me I mean maybe I would I
don't know though it just seems kind of
gimmicky and does it actually work cute
packaging
okay so there's one for maybelline there
curva sued literally I guess I don't
know I just don't even understand having
something at a curse because I've gotten
used to just having it as straight
things so I guess it would only be for
you if you really like that style but
otherwise it's just a normal liquid
liner so thank you that you'll subscribe
before you leave catch more of my
drugstore videos and I'll see you guys
in my next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
