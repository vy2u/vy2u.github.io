a I always clap in the intro just always
it's become the weirdest habit hey guys
it's just I like always do it
go back and watch my videos you're gonna
see me clap every time and I noticed the
one I edit but then I never think about
it when I'm filming
so today I've got a drugstore haul it
has been a hot minute since I've done
one of these this bag is getting pretty
heavy so most of this stuff I've been
using for the past couple of weeks cuz I
actually bought this stuff a couple of
weeks ago so I'll be able to tell you
guys kind of how I like it how I like
the shades because some of it is stuff I
already own but I got a different shade
including what I'm wearing on my lips
today you will find out in this video so
that's going to get into it first thing
let's talk about what's on my lips I had
to buy two more of these because I love
them so much these are the maybelline
color blurs and I already own two of
them and I really really like them my
favorite shade is very misbehaved where
it's like kind of a kind of like this
but it's more of like a red like a berry
red which I really liked
well I got two more I got I like to
mauve it or move it however you want to
say it and this one's just a perfect
everyday color I like to wear these to
work so for me this was like I was like
of course I find that these are matte
but they're comfortable and they stay in
place and you don't need a lip liner
with them now I never use the other side
of its like this kind of rubbery thing
that you're supposed to be able to kind
of blend or you know but I'm like I
don't it doesn't really need it anyways
so the shade I'm wearing today is my my
magenta now this shade just looking at
this I thought it would be more like
purplish wine color but it's basically
fuchsia so I was kind not let down cuz
it's still a pretty color but it wasn't
quite what I had expected so I was a
little bit sad about that but again it's
just absolutely gorgeous I can swatch
this one but you can see I mean it's
like fuchsia to me sorry but I love
these so now I've got four I want to buy
even more of them but I wanted to come
out with some new colors of those but if
you haven't tried them I think you would
be surprised so if you're more of a
neutral person get go if I like to mauve
it it's a really
nice one so this next one I have been on
the hunt for for forever because you
guys recommend it and it's totally a
dupe if not better than the cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination
powder foundation that's close to the
name I love that stuff because it's a
powder foundation but it has this like
quality where it doesn't make you look
matte it makes you just look kind of
nice like satin so all of you guys told
me that this Physicians Formula
youthful we're in the illuminating
formula was a dupe for it this is better
than the it cosmetic stuff it has this
unbelievable smell it smells like clean
laundry in the best way and when I like
the brush I always use with it smells
like it now too
and I love it anyway but it's just this
perfect powder foundation formula where
you put it all over I'm wearing it today
and it makes you look healthy like it
mattifies but not so much like it's just
perfect so if you don't like a super
matte look I don't like a super matte
look you will love this stuff like I am
so excited that I finally tried it and
it really is that good it is sold out
everywhere it took me forever and I
actually bought one that was like kind
of like not damaged but like the
packaging was kind of weird and damaged
and there's like tape on it like
whatever I'm just buying it and there
was nothing wrong with it was clearly
not used once I opened it but I loved it
so you guys have got to go out and try
it until you find a coupon or a sale for
position formula but it is amazing and
it supposedly translucent so I think
they only have one shape but there's the
matte finish and the illuminating finish
and this is the illuminating finish this
next thing is another Physicians Formula
and so if you are going for the sale I
would recommend these two products this
is the Physicians Formula shimmer strips
all-in-one custom nude palette for face
and eyes I use it as a highlighter you
could use it either way but it's got the
cutest packaging in the world it is so
buttery and creamy it stays all day as a
highlighter you could also wear it as
eye shadow like if you just do singular
shadows but I mean honestly I just got I
have plenty of eye shadow that's not
what I wanted it for but you totally
could in the back of it it's magnetic in
the back there's like two
Rush's there's a like bigger kind of
face brush kind of like the ones you'd
get in like the benefit box blushes just
like those actually and there's a mirror
and then there's also this little sponge
tip so if you did want to use it for eye
and eye look you could so that's really
really nice so much I'm so surprised I'm
wearing this today I think it just gives
a nice healthy glow you can really amp
it up if you like layer it on top or you
could just do a light dusting it looks
nice on the tip of your nose as well not
so much again I feel like I've been a
far away from Physicians Formula for a
while for no reason other than I just
haven't really been interested in
anything by them lately but these are
amazing so now I'm like I feel like I
need to get like back into them the next
thing I bought is this Maybelline master
fix setting and perfecting loose powder
it's just a white translucent powder I
used it today it's very white when you
first put it on so you almost don't want
to use a lot but at the same time you
kind of have to to get it to set it so
I'm not sure I feel like I don't hate it
I just only used it twice so I just
don't know but it's just a finely milled
powder it comes like this man I always
get it everywhere so I need to try it
some more I wish they had more of a
beige color in this I wonder if that's
to come like if they will soon
I would totally prefer that over this
but even still like if you like to bake
this might be good for that I don't
typically bake but you never know all
right next thing I bought was a
repurchase these are the Maybelline
Dream Lumi touch highlighting concealers
I got one in the shade ivory and then
the other I got in the radiant color now
I'm gonna open these because I want to
show you them the radio actually I think
I've had both of them in the past the
radiant one I repurchase more often it's
a very kind of it's not coming across
throw away it's a very pinkish toned
concealer or highlight or whatever you
want to call it these are brush tips by
the way and you just twist the thing to
get the product up into the brush just
like the YSL Touche clot ones but the
one I got an ivory is more of a yellow
toned there you go you can kind of see
it so this is the one in ivory that's
the one in radiant so they are different
I like both and you
use them as facial concealers they blend
like a dream you could put a little bit
I'm wearing it today what I'm wearing
the eye everyone today and just use your
finger to kind of Pat it in and it
dissolves into your skin and it just
brightens it it is amazing now I don't
think this cover is very very dark by
under eye circles but it is really nice
it is really bright you could like I
said you could even use it all over your
face it's amazing all right so then I
got a bunch of lip products and some eye
products so let's do the lip ones first
these are the is it Rimmel these are the
Rimmel oh my gloss lip glosses and I got
two different shades I got one that's
more of a pink tone called stay my rose
and then the one that's more kind of
peachy neutral is called non-stop
glamour wait a second did you guys
already know is this just a remake I
just went to get my lip gloss that I
already have it's the Rimmel stay glossy
in non-stop glamour is this just a
remake of it I mean is that it they got
rid of this and just renamed it and
repackaged it maybe it is they look
similar but they don't look exactly see
so this is the old-school Rimmel one in
non-stop glamour it's just a very sheer
semi peachy one with a little bit of a
gold shimmer which is exactly how the
new one looks let's try that the new one
is more pigmented well they have pretty
much the same smell and honestly it's
the same it's the exact same gloss so
now I know maybe I'm just way out of the
loop and everyone else knows that they
probably do I'm just having the loop but
anyway so now I've got two of them
that's fine this one's probably getting
a little bit older anyway so that's not
too terrible that I have a new one but I
really like these lip glosses so like
this one and the old one in blushing
Belle grace I wear like I had to go get
this out of my purse so I love these so
much so I guess it's not such a bad
thing and then the other shade I've got
in the new one is like I said stay my
rows and again it's just a sheer pinkish
gloss with that little bit of shimmer to
it it's so these are just so pretty
they're really comfortable to wear
you never slip products that I got are
these L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
glosses I
can't believe ever tried these these
things are amazing I got two shades this
one's in the shade oh boy why do they
not have the shade names on these oh
it's on the top so this one is the more
nude one and it's in the shade 318 it's
bear attraction and these have a very
pointy triangular sponge tip which I
really like these are like a whipped
formula and they're so comfortable they
feel like I don't even know how to
describe it they just feel like whipped
cream on your lips but they're
comfortable they don't really go
anywhere they're mad enough like I don't
care if it's super matte or semi matte
because I don't really unless I'm
specifically going for that look like
sometimes I want that in a red lip but
these are really comfortable the texture
is so cool if you've never tried it I
just really like these I feel like
something that's close to these is the
vivid mattes from what does that
Maybelline and I didn't love those these
are a little bit better I really really
like these so if you're on the market
for something new you just want to
branch out I want to get some now now
that I tried these I want to get some
bolder colors as well to try those out
the pink one by the way is in the shade
300 blushing ambition so I also got some
new eye products that I am very excited
about let's serve it this one this is
one of the Maybelline Color tattoos
crayons and this one's in charcoal
chrome and it's just a jumbo crayon for
your eyes
I love how quick this is to apply in the
morning I'll usually just color it in
kind of blend it into the crease throw
some eyeliner on and my eye look is done
and it kind of looks like I tried
because that's a darker color and I'll
even do like my lower lash line with
this it's such a pretty deep color for a
smoky look and I love it it's very
creamy it glides right on but it also
still blends pretty well so if you are
wanting to smoke it out you totally can
kind of tone it down a little bit so I
only got one shade in this because I
wasn't sure if it'd be good now I want
to go back and get a couple more now I
got three shades of the next product and
these are also from the color tattoo
line but it's their color tattoo I
chromes and these are these sponge tip
applicator these are really nice this
one is in the
a full skull and it's kind of this dark
green and like I said these are sponge
tip but they are so pigmented this one
is this gorgeous deep green and I again
I'm really into deep colors right now
and it's part of it it's just it's that
time of year but it's so beautiful and
it has this gorgeous gold shimmer in it
and again these don't really have any
fallout because it's inside of the kind
of cream this one is in the shade bronze
sheen and it's kind of a greenish bronze
if that makes any sense it's got kind of
that tint to it
it's so beautiful again you could use it
alone you could use as a base under some
shadow if you want to really make it pop
I've just been using them alone or I'll
put it on the lid and then use regular
shadows like in the crease and stuff
like that just to kind of blend it all
together in the last shade I got is
beige luster and this one is the only
one that like it was kind I don't want
to say sheer it's a lighter shade and so
it tends to almost look like it's not
there do you see what I mean so I think
with these your best bet is to go with
the deeper shades and if you're only
into liar shades like this is still
really pretty but it doesn't really pack
as much of a punch either under shadow
or on top or alone just because of the
shade now if you've got deeper skin it
would look really pretty so that was
everything I bought this time around at
the drugstore was a ton of stuff I was
so I'm so excited to try a lot of these
out some more if I love them I might be
mentioning them in favourites videos if
I hated them they might be in that same
video as a blob other than that there
are some of these like I might do a
separate review video on like maybe the
color tattoos but I think these are such
a great drugstore find and the shades
are especially the green and the gold
are such a unique shade for the
drugstore that they're really worth
checking out so a lot of hits for me
this time around I was very excited
about that so let me know what other
products are out there that you're dying
for me to try out or maybe you don't
know if you want to buy it so you'd like
me to buy it to kind of review it and
swatch it and things like that let me
