what is that oh it's just shining weird
so today we're gonna be trying out the
brand-new Twilight enjoying these out so
really it's a review but I wanted to
show you me applying them so you could
see them these are the Milani palettes
they're like all finger print E but it's
their bold obsessions palette which is a
let's see 12 pan palette absolutely
gorgeous mix of mattes and shimmers all
of these packs such a punch and they
blend so beautifully and the other
palette is their most loved mattes and
again twelve shadows all of these are
matte however lots of warm tones they've
got some purples in there some kind of
reddish oranges oh I love these so these
every time I've showed them on my
snapchat a lot of you guys are like
those look like Cielo palettes are they
I mean they look like high-end palettes
they do there's no doubt about it now
they are all plastic but it it clasps
shut I mean I've got no complaints a big
ol mirror no wasted space no wasted
space at all on that I love so I usually
these were $20 online when I bought them
I have heard from a lot of you guys that
you can get them at Walmart for 15 so if
I can find a link to Walmart's website
for them for 15 of course I will put
that below and I can also link the
Milani cosmetics one as well I don't
know it might depend on where you live
like weird things ship I don't know
these are starting to pop up a lot in
other stores though which is exciting
because it is this so pretty darn new
release I love like I kind of want them
to just release like both of these
together in one giant palette no Jessica
you don't need that that's ridiculous no
no no anyway because the second I do
that I buy it like this is just like
really big dough like I can't travel
with it I can't make up my mind
it can't be happy anyway so we are going
to I've already put on a primer today
I'm actually trying out the Catrice
prime and fine brightening eyeshadow
base so far I really like it it's kind
of like it's a white color and a doe
foot and you just blend it in and it
really I mean I feel like it did
brighten and cover really well so that
is what we're trying out underneath it
but what I always start with
is I'm gonna start in the bold no sorry
the most loved mass I'm just gonna grab
like a matte cream shade and I'm just
gonna put that all over both the brow
bone and lid just everywhere absolutely
everywhere it kind of evens everything
out it makes sure that if your primer is
sticky at least for me I like to have
this first layer down so that way when
I'm putting things in the crease and
it's like really important placement
that it doesn't end up getting stuck in
some spots because it still got little
sticky spots all around this kind of
gets rid of and eliminates those sticky
spots so the next step I like to take is
again in the matte one this kind of like
a little bit darker beige I mean it's
still pretty pretty light this is a step
I do because of my skin tone if you've
got a deeper skin tone you won't need
this because again it's gonna be too
light for you but what I do is I take a
shade a little bit deeper than my skin
so if you can find one in these pallets
or really any palette and I just put
that in the crease kind of going towards
the brow bone not all the way up there
but it's kind of a another base just for
my crease to help everything blend
together these shadows are so pretty I
can't I can't believe these are
drugstore and you're gonna hear me say
that a lot in this video but I can't and
even at the twenty dollar range these
are incredible I could see any brand
like if this were a nameless brand
you've never seen it before
they were sold at Sephora for $40 and
you bought it you would be completely
satisfied at the $40 e and that's I
guess what I'm saying so even though I
complain like me and drugstore prices
are creeping up and they are and it
stinks because it's starting to price
people out of brands that they used to
be able to buy you know what I mean but
that aside when it's a product that this
good I'm like okay I get it
but the problem is when drugstore brands
are charging $15.99 $6.99 for a pallet
that stinks you know what I mean so okay
I love that I feel like that I mean I
could go out just like this with a
little bit of liner mascara and I would
feel like that's still a really nice
look it's really simplified but I like
that I have got
so my next step is to go with a little
bit deeper of a shade so I'm gonna go
with the we're gonna go gosh I could do
like all maps and be totally happy
they're all so pretty
okay I'm gonna stick in the matte shade
UH one I'm gonna take this third one
down here kind of a brown color medium
brown and I'm gonna try to keep that a
hug it a little tighter to the crease
and a little bit in the outer corner
these blend together so so well I mean
do you see the color going on just with
such ease they remind me of Vice art
shadows and that's crazy
RVs aren't vizier because those are like
so much more expensive so much more
these do pick up a little bit of powder
but nothing nothing crazy I mean you
know you there are some pallets out
there that are pressed more like pressed
pigments and those kick up a lot this
kicks up a little bit but not like other
brands I've tried that's for sure so
I've pretty much got the base of my look
down this is like this is my everyday
look guys I really don't switch it up
often unless I'm trying a little bit of
color or something but like the order
and pattern of everything is pretty much
always the same so I'm gonna go in with
this kind of like Bert I don't even know
what to call it kind of a reddish tone
but it's a little bit more muted and I'm
using a more detailed brush this is the
elf crease brush and I'm just gonna put
that kind of more in the outer corner
and the outer crease just a little bit
of definition you see only I don't want
a little high on the other side so now I
feel like I need to even it out you guys
know I'm not a makeup artist you know
this look isn't gonna be perfect right
so um again so now I'm just using you
know a brush I just cleaned off just
wiped off to blend everything cuz I like
a super blended look when I can get it
and these shadows really lend themselves
well to blending like I've said three
times so again this would be enough but
I wanted to use this shimmer so you
could just see what that looks like and
they have some beautiful options in here
this is great if you're like
I don't want to buy both Jess and I know
I like shimmer and matte if you know you
like just mats then go for the matte one
because it's amazing and I just did this
whole look with that but if you know you
like a mix then I would say just get
this one because it still has the medium
brown the light brown dark brown a black
a red but it also has these shimmer
colors as well so it's a really good mix
I think they did a good job this
actually reminds me a lot of that one
palette I'll pull it out in a second
it reminds me a lot of it and it's a way
more since one alright so I think with
this look I'm gonna go for this like
kind of orange e shimmer and I'm just
gonna use my finger now if I had put a
like vivid white primer underneath this
it makes this pop even more but for the
sake of this video I wanted you to just
see how it looks on just normal primers
this is the primer I used is still a
brightening primer but it's not like the
NYX little pot of white primer I can
link below that is my favorite thing to
tap onto the lid and then tap a shimmer
like that on top and it's like out of
this world so I like to still kind of
blend it soften the look just a bit
these are all so pretty now you could
have also used a light shade which is
something I do honestly most days I'm
going to work I'd do the same thing but
instead of like this orange I might use
like the champagne color or the gold and
it looks really pretty that way too I
just figured I don't know I feel like
the oranges look nice with this green
maybe I'm crazy so here's what I will
say about the mattes spectacular
shimmers gorgeous but when you do it
without a see I already have a little
fallout to clean up there's a little bit
of fallout usually just in this outer
region and it's usually nothing I can't
get rid of just by doing that which is
nice but these shimmers they're not
going to look like Vava voom like urban
decay status unless you put that thick
sticky white primer let me show you my
favorite this is the best one I found
and it's like five eight bucks I don't
know it's under $10
the NYX eyeshadow base it's in white it
lasts forever and you just get a tiny
bit and tap it on and you can kind of
see that the shimmer it's like there's a
strip of the shimmer that kind of stayed
and then above it it kind of blended out
you don't have to blend it the way I do
because they'll stay a little bit more
like if I wanted to pile a little more
on I I can you know then I can just
leave it be but just be aware that you
really can get it to pack even more of a
punch I still think that's nice though
does that am I making any sense am I
being redundant probably that's kind of
my two cents on the shimmers they're
absolutely gorgeous and let me swatch
the other few shimmers so you can really
see these are ridiculous
look at that little bit of powder oh my
gosh and let me just swatch the orange
so you can see what it looks like just
swatched aren't these stupid gorgeous so
like I said use a really good primer and
they're gonna look like that otherwise
they're gonna blend a little bit a
little bit of fallout will come and
it'll still look nice like what I've
used but it'll look better so the next
step is brow bone so again I'm gonna go
back to the mattes just cuz this might
be my favorite out of the two palettes
but they're so good
and I'm just gonna get the matte cream
shade I started with and put it on my
brow bone just to kind of clean that up
just a tinge this is another elf brush I
clearly I used so many elf brushes it
does it's part of their like beautifully
it says it's their 201 I love this thing
for my brow bone anytime it's like
really dirty I'm like dang it like what
do I use it's my favorite I've had it
for like years if you haven't seen I
recently did an elf best and worst video
I will link below if you're curious and
watching it it's like a ton of products
of the best things they offer that I've
tried over the years because I really
there's so many favorites of mine that
are from elf and it's really really
cheap okay so the last thing I typically
will do is I will sometimes darken the
outer corner a bit more I think I'm good
for today but I could go back in with
the shade I already had but I'm gonna
use that same outer corner shade and
just kind of do my lower lash line so
I'm gonna get a really kind of smaller
brush whatever your cup of tea is and
I'm just gonna kind of
start on the outer corner get it to
match with that and then kind of move it
in and sometimes I'll take it and kind
of flick it up just a bit if I'm
noticing hey you know what it's not as
dark as it was like I said you can throw
a little bit more of it just kind of up
there to make it flow together a little
bit more then if there's any fallout I
do that just in case even with high end
pallets I have fallout so that's not
really a fault of these pallets now one
thing I do like doing and I'm just gonna
show again for the purpose of this video
I'm gonna go back into the bold
obsessions palette with the shimmers and
I'm gonna get a little of this crazy
white shimmer this one here and I'm
gonna throw that on the brow bone but
what I like to do a little trick if you
like the shimmer but you don't want it
to be like so ridiculously shimmer right
on your brow bone I'll get the shimmer
and then I'll dip into like a matte
color blow a little bit off or tap it
off if you're grossed out by blink then
when I put it on it still has a sheen to
it but it's not as stark as it would
have been if you just went into that
shimmer I love doing this sometimes I'll
just use whatever face highlight I'm
using to do the same thing but I always
take my fluffy brush afterwards and just
kind of blend it very very lightly so
that way it's not in my brows anymore
it's not you know just blends a little
bit better into the rest of this shadow
look so I'm gonna light my eyes I just
started really really quickly and either
throw mascara or lashes on I don't know
I hate putting on lashes cuz they take a
thousand years but I am gonna be filming
a lot today and they look better in
videos we'll see what I end up with and
then I will check back in show you the
final look and we'll talk through you
know the pros and cons of these palettes
so I did end up putting some lashes on I
put on the Ardell natural 110 so it
snatched their natural line and it's the
110 one and this is just a multi pack I
don't know if I bought these are they
send them to me cuz I have bought a lot
of multi packs because these lashes are
cheap compared to other expensive lashes
and for me I'm not a lash snob like I'm
not very
good at them and these are so easy to
put on the band is really thin so it
doesn't give you that fake like black
line look if that makes any sense and
these really are more natural and yet
they're still like lengthening so I'm
digging these and then on my lips if you
were just curious I just put on the
pixie mat last liquid lip in pastel
petals so I'll link those below but all
in all pros and cons of these palettes
pros the packaging is beautiful they
blend really well they're really
pigmented depending on which one you get
you know a really nice range of matte
shades versus a really nice mix of
shimmer and matte and they're like
wearable colors and yet there's still
those little pops if you want to get
creative they stay on all day I can't
say enough good stuff about it honestly
cons the only thing I can think of is
maybe the price point because of course
if you're wanting to spend five dollars
on pal well you're not that's not gonna
be these but if you're like you know
what I don't want to buy a crazy
expensive high-end palettes but I want
something nicer than everything else
that treadeth the drugstore these are
them these are my favorite drugstore pal
I've ever tried ever ever in the years
I've been doing youtube ever so I am so
excited that these are part of my life
I'm gonna be recommending them like
crazy it might get annoying but they're
so so good so other than that oh maybe
another con is that it shows
fingerprints I don't know I mean it does
kind of drive me nuts but not enough
that I would really really consider it a
con you know but other than that if you
enjoyed this kind of a video maybe more
like product spotlight I feel like I do
a lot of videos of like tons of products
which I enjoy watching cuz I get to
learn about a lot all in 10 minutes or
so but if you enjoy these you know kind
of product spotlight kind of videos let
me know cuz I don't do them very often
anymore but I do enjoy doing them so let
me know if you're interested in those
and if there are any specific new
products out there especially drugstore
that you are curious about and other
than that I hope you'll subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
