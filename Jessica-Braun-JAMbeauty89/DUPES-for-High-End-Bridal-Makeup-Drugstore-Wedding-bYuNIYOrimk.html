going to be sharing with you guys the
makeup that I wore on my wedding day got
a lot of questions about this this is
not going to be a tutorial video there
are so many of those on YouTube that are
amazing but this is going to be more of
like a shopping guide that's what I kind
of found when I was looking through
YouTube videos trying to find kind of
what makeup to buy I used a lot of
tutorials to kind of build my own idea
of what I wanted but I really wanted
just kind of like a full list of
trustworthy makeup for weddings and what
I found is there were a lot of lists but
most of them only listed one item for
each thing like one primer one
foundation one mascara and I kind of
wanted to have options a lot of them are
really expensive and I'm going to name a
lot of expensive products but with every
single product I mentioned I'm also
going to tell you about a drugstore dupe
for it or at least maybe not a 100% dupe
but one that performs the exact same way
is that in mind every product I
mentioned is something that I trust to
last an entire day through 100 degree
heat my reception was outside and it was
a hundred degrees that day so it lasted
the entire day and not only that but
it's got to look good in photography so
things that don't have SPF so every
product that I mentioned is going to be
listed below with a link and it'll be
organized by what I'm talking about and
in order so if you want you can copy and
paste that sucker print it out go to the
store and use it as a shopping guide I
would have loved to have had that so
hopefully this will help you guys so
with that being said let's go ahead and
get into it I'm wearing a lot of the
products on my face today I kind of
recreated my Bridal look but I changed a
few things and I'll mention those as we
go through let's talk about primers the
one that I wore on my wedding day was
the Tarte clean slate poreless this is a
clear primer that's kind of silicon
based it's got that like slippery feel
to it but when you press it into your
skin it really does hold on to your
foundation all day I would recommend
drugstore wise the Maybelline master
crime buy face studio primer
and this is their blur and smooth one
they have a few different ones but this
is the one that's got kind of the light
blue packaging with the black now the
Maybelline master prime is not clear in
the same way but they perform the same
way under foundation that I have found
so I would trust both of these with my
wedding day the next thing that would go
on foundation so I wore on my wedding
day the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
now they just redid this formula but I'm
pretty sure it's still pretty similar
this is really expensive to be honest
with you guys I kind of regretted buying
this because while it was great and it
looks great in photography it is the
exact same to me as the Revlon Colorstay
whipped this is one of my Holy Grail
foundations I've loved forever I wear
the shade 150 buff it's just a jar and
it really is like a thicker foundation
but when you apply it either with your
fingers or a Beauty Blender or a brush
it looks flawless and beautiful it's
what I'm wearing today this is great but
this is just as good and honestly I
think if I redid it I would just not
spend the money and just use this
because it's amazing another one I would
recommend none of these have SPF is the
Loreal Pro matte foundation if you can
find one in your shade this is really
really nice too I would definitely say
these are very very comparable all three
of these are trustworthy and amazing and
they'll look great in photos and lasts
through the heat the next thing that I
typically put on is concealer I have
four concealers to mention today the two
expensive ones that I kind of wore
together on my wedding day this is the
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye it's a
really thick concealer very very light
and this is in the shade light but I
usually do that triangle under my eyes I
also used the tarte maracuja creaseless
concealer this one is a little bit more
of like a dewy finish if that makes any
sense so you do have to set it with the
powder but both of these are very
similar and amazing I think I like the
it cosmetics one just a little bit
better but I kind of mix them both on my
wedding day and put them under my eye
but either way you go they're great they
don't crease they really really have
high coverage the drugstore versions I
wanted to recommend first is the hard
candy glamoflauge concealer this is
found at Walmart it can be hard to find
if you
near a Walmart or maybe your Walmart
doesn't have as much of a selection I
love this stuff it's just as thick I
would consider it an absolute dupe for
them and it stays all day another one if
you don't want it to be as thick is the
master conceal by Maybelline this one is
a similar packaging and it's got pretty
good coverage not as much but it's a lot
of thinner so if you know you don't like
those thicker concealers this might be a
great option for you let's talk about
bronzing and contouring now I ended up
contouring my face and I didn't put any
bronzer I actually used my contour
powder as my bronzer I did the same
thing today I used a really expensive
product though this is the Kevin of Kwan
sculpting powder in medium this is
amazing I've hit pan I will repurchase
it when it when it runs out because it
doesn't move all day it's that perfect
kind of gray tone and it just works for
everyone that has a lighter skin tone
like I do it is amazing however a lot of
people recommend it to me before I
bought that the NYX HD powder in taupe
but this is a lot darker now I think
they redid the formula and I don't even
think it's coming across on camera
it's way darker it's nice but it would
be better for a deeper skin tone I now
would recommend now that I found it the
elf contour palette I just did a demo
and review of this palette it's six
dollars it has everything you could need
and this kind of taupe shade there is
perfect it is so amazing I cannot
recommend this highly enough it is
amazing and this yellow shade right here
I use to set my under eye today
beautiful you can use it to highlight
your face without having any shimmer in
it it is incredible now for blush the
one I wore on my wedding day is the bomb
down boy blush this is kind of pricey
regular price regularly price but on
HauteLook which is when I bought it it's
like ten dollars on there so if you can
catch it it's just a beautiful light
pink I would recommend going with the
matte blush just because you can add
highlight and like glimmer if you want
with an actual highlighting powder
because when you have it in your blush
you make the whole area there almost too
shimmery so I would recommend getting a
matte one I love this these
do not move the bone blushes don't move
I would also recommend drugstore why's
the Milani blushes but not the shimmery
ones they have a few matte ones this is
another one that's a matte pink it's in
the shade
delicioso pink beautiful beautiful
beautiful doesn't budge all day another
one the elf studio blushes they have a
pretty good color range this one's in
candid coral it's my personal favorite
it's a light peach so if you need it
want to go the pink route you could
definitely go with one of these and then
of course the Tarte blushes are amazing
they recently sent me a ton of them and
this is the one out of all of them I
picked out this is in flush and it's
another light paint so I would say
depending on your budget there are so
many amazing options but really the
ultimate lining ones are amazing all
right for highlight the one that I wore
and the one I'm wearing today is by hard
candy so it's like an $8 product about
and it's their bronzer in the shade Tiki
and it's clearly more of a highlight
it's a beautiful golden highlight I love
it now you do I mean this is I think
this is more than what I wore my wedding
day I did use a lighter hand because I
didn't want it to capture the light but
it felt really scared about that or
maybe you already have oily skin and
you're scared that oil will come through
I would say don't go with one as
shimmery is this I would say go with
like an hourglass powder this is their
ambient lighting palette it's really
really expensive but this shade right
over here is beautiful because it's not
too shimmery it's just kind of got a
glow to it all of these are beautiful
now the drugstore option one of my Holy
Grails is the wet and wild color icon
bronzer in reserve your cabana it's no
secret that this is like a dupe for that
shade I just showed you it's just got a
glimmer to it but it's not shimmery at
all it's beautiful you can use this all
over your face and you never look crazy
so those are my favorite highlights for
Bridal now for brows I used I like to
use pencils I use the Anasazi brow is
it's what I use today and I use it in
medium brown and then I use the
Anastasia brow gel just because it
really is like hairspray for your brows
they do not move however the elf brow I
don't know what it's called as rub
but I have a demo with this I can link
below as well the elf do a proud duo's
where it's got the pencil and then the
spoolie
they're amazing I honestly switch
between both of these because I like
them both so much and then the NYX
control-freak brow gel doesn't hold as
strong as the Anastasia one but if your
eyebrows aren't unruly it's going to
hold exactly as much as you need so
definitely great this is only five
dollars versus like twenty-something
dollars now to set your makeup
I bought the Ben Nye final seal
specifically for my wedding but I ended
up using a lot on my honeymoon as well
it is hairspray for your face your face
it just stays the same it really is
incredible
however the L'Oreal infallible spray is
very similar they both have alcohol in
it so I wouldn't use it everyday but for
your wedding day or for a special event
these both hold onto your makeup really
really well honestly this is like $14
this was like twelve on line for the
smaller size so I would say go with the
Ben nine now for powder on your face
this is kind of out of order now I on my
wedding day I use the Mac mineralize
skinfinish natural however I realize
sense that this breaks me out like crazy
so if you know it doesn't break you out
and go for it but I can't use it now so
a perfect dupe for this is the NYX a
matte but not flat powder foundation you
can get it and you know whatever shades
you need and it's really really high
coverage you can use it to set your
under-eye you can use it just to
highlight certain areas if you get like
a lighter color than what you typically
wear otherwise it just soaks up the oil
that you need soaked up really quickly
this is one that I would like have maybe
a bridesmaid can have in a nearby
location if you need to kind of touch-up
because you're oily this is amazing and
then I would also recommend if you're
not too oily and you don't want to look
cakey the Rimmel stay matte is amazing I
this is my old one I'm still trying to
use up I just bought a new one yesterday
I love this so much it's like four or
five bucks at the drugstore fantastic
powder however this one does not have
super high coverage so that's what
you're looking for go with the next one
alright so to prime your eyes now we're
moving
the eyes on my wedding day I used the
Too Faced shadow insurance however this
is expensive for what it is and what I
use today and what I use most days is
the Milani eyeshadow primer it's the
exact same product it holds on your
shadow the exact same but it's like half
the price if not more I would also
recommend the wet and wild by Fergie
take on the day eye shadow primer
again these all you squeeze about you
there's got a little bit of the nude
color to it you rub it on your eyes
holds on the shadow that's its job and
they all do the exact same job now for
shadow I've gotten this question a lot
what I'm wearing on my eyes today is
from the lorac Pro palette if you were
going to splurge on one item for your
wedding I would recommend this this is
this is all I needed I ended up grabbing
like a few shadows from different things
because I took a long time to do my
makeup because you know it's my wedding
day I wanted to take my time but I could
have only used this palette so what I
did today is I use this nude shade here
it's a really shimmery white color on my
the inner part of my lid I use light
bronze kind of on the outer part of my
lid then I used taupe all over in my
crease and then I used a little bit of
mauve as well I kind of mixed them and
did that then I use the matte black on
the outer corner and on the outer part
of my crease as well it blends
beautifully so it never looks like a
scary black it just blends really really
nicely and then I used this cream matte
shade on my brow bone and then I just
mix it all together through a little bit
more of the nude on top and you're good
to go that's all I did
I mean it's so simple and yet it can
look really really elegant you can do if
you wanted some pops of color you needed
more browns there there in there
it's got everything you need it's
expensive but it's worth it it is worth
every penny
now some other recommendations if you
are on a budget those still the hard
candy naturalised palette has some it's
like $8 at Walmart it has some shimmery
shades here that are absolutely gorgeous
and then it also has some beautiful
matte shades it's everything you would
need the only thing I would say
instead of the star crown maybe get like
a matte black shadow that's really
inexpensive from the drugstore and then
you've got everything you can need
anyway so this is incredible and it has
its own primer there I would also say
you could get some elf shadows I have my
elf shadows and a Mac palette here elf
has one dollar i shadow pans that fit in
they sell their own little palettes but
you can also get a matte palette for
actually pretty cheap and fill it
whatever you want you could also get a Z
palette the elf shadows are a dollar and
they're amazing they are just as good if
not more buttery than like matte shadows
are I can't recommend those enough so
then you can pick the exact colors you
want now for eyeliner the NYC eyeliner
pencil it's a gel liner and it's
waterproof it's so cheap it's under five
dollars it's so black and it does not
move it really is waterproof so this is
my one liner recommendation I've got
tons of high-end black eyeliner pencils
but none of them are any better than
this so this is just the one I would
recommend I would also however recommend
wearing a cream or a gel eyeliner for
your wedding that's what I wore that's
where when I wear everyday on my upper
lash line but I love the L'Oreal 24 hour
lacquer liner it's incredible it does
not move you can do a really thick line
whatever you want you can do with this
it is amazing so that's what I would
recommend the Maybelline one I don't own
it anymore I'll probably buy that next
time we switch between the Maybelline
one in this but the Maybelline one I'll
link below just as amazing they're
exactly the same they're both incredibly
black and don't budge now if you're a
liquid liner gal which I triple layer I
do pencil then the cream liner then
liquid liner this is a high-end product
it's I want to say more than $20 or
maybe right around $20 it's the Stila
stay all day waterproof liquid liner
this is the best liquid liner I've ever
used in my entire life I can't even
recommend another one to you from the
drugstore because I've never found one
that's anywhere close to this if you
have recommendations let me know below
because I'm curious but I've tried a lot
this is the best one out there the pen
is
perfect you can do like a little wing I
did a small wing kind of like I did
today where it's barely noticeable but
enough that it kind of shapes my eye
well this is amazing it's waterproof it
does not move if you swatch it on your
hand and let it dry you can't get it off
you've got to get like some actual
makeup remover it is incredible
incredible now on my wedding day I did
wear lashes I had bought some mink
lashes from HauteLook because I could
get them really cheap on there and I
tried them out and I liked them but I
ended up wearing ardell lashes because
they looked better and I don't know how
that could be but they did so I wore
ardell demi whispies now I don't have
the demi whispies I have some Demi's and
I have some whispies but I don't have
the actual demi wispies those are the
ones I would recommend they seem to
flatter so many people you can cut them
to fit your eye shape which I did have
to do they were a little too long but
they lasted so well throughout the day
the glue that I used was the duo lash
glue it's pretty good you do need to let
it dry watch some tutorials on YouTube
about how to apply lashes um but I can
rather commit the Ardell ones enough and
there's so much cheaper than being
flashes it's crazy especially if you're
not a lash person and you're not going
to reuse them a ton after that just get
Ardell ones but I still put mascara on
before I put the lashes on so I wore the
Maybelline lash discovery waterproof
mascara it's got a tiny tiny brush so
you can really kind of tight line your
eyes with it and this is especially
amazing for your lower lash line to get
really specific with each lash but then
I would recommend if you aren't wearing
lashes or even if you are the mascaras I
love my two favorite are the L'Oreal
voluminous now I like the original
formula better but I did get the
waterproof and wear that because I knew
I was going to cry which I did but none
of it ran so that's important so L'Oreal
voluminous I love but then I also love
the Jordana best lash extreme I haven't
tried the waterproof yet but even the
regular one is so amazing it is so
amazing it's what I'm wearing today
since I'm not wearing my lashes now one
last thing I would recommend that you
have to bring with you is the elf makeup
remover pen or any sort of makeup
remover pen it has makeup remover built
in so if you mess up or you've got like
weird like if you have
she's on and there's mascara on them and
you get it at the top you can just wipe
it away and blend it in you're good to
go
it cleans it up it's literally I used
this so much while getting ready it was
crazy it's three dollars and worth every
penny I cannot recommend that enough so
for lips I'm actually I'll show you the
lipstick I wore but I wouldn't recommend
it because I wore it because it was
meaningful to me but it was not a long
wearing lipstick so it was a really bad
choice the one I wore is Edward Bess is
the brand I got it on HauteLook it's in
the shade Rose demure and it's this
really pretty just rosy pink color
however I've recreated what I wore with
different products that are longer
wearing and would just be better in
general for Bridal so what I'm wearing
are it's an elf matte lip color I
recommend these all the time I love elf
these this is one of their best products
I'm wearing the shade dash of pink and
it's just a really nice pink color and
you do I almost want with a pretty nude
lip but I'm so glad I went with more of
a little bit of a pink because it's
going to stand out a little bit better
in photos and you know photos send to
wash people out so I was really glad I
went with the pink shade loved this one
but the elf matte line is amazing
they've got deeper shades like berry
sorbet is like a berry color rich red is
like a deeper wine color and these are
fantastic because they last a long time
they dry right away because they are
matte so they just stay put now the
liner I would recommend and I'm only
going to recommend one because it's my
favorite it's the Rimmel exaggerate line
of lip liner so they've got Reds they've
got Pink's my favorite that I'm wearing
today as well is an East End snob and
it's just again kind of that rosy pink
color these dry right away they're so
creamy they don't budge I love these
liners another drugstore option are the
Maybelline matte lipsticks I love all of
these lust for blush as a favorite it's
a really pretty color
they've got deeper colors if you like
that they've got more peachy colors like
clay crush those are amazing again a dry
matte formula it just dries and stay
put fantastic however if you were
thinking that you want to splurge on a
lipstick because I mean lipsticks are
kind of personal and a lipstick that you
wearing your wedding day I think is
special like I will always think that
this ever best one is a very special
lipstick to me so if you were wanting to
splurge on one the Marc Jacobs Lamarck
lip creams are the it's the best
lipstick I've ever tried like I'm losing
my mind even thinking about it now this
isn't a bright red called oh my oh my
Lee I wore in Paris if you saw our vlogs
I love this color but for a wedding I
mean I wouldn't wear red lips some
people do especially it's like holiday
weddings and it's just really really
beautiful but this entire line of
lipsticks are amazing they're really
really pricey though which I only have
one of them I want to get another one so
badly anyway that's what I would
recommend if you were wanting to splurge
now for gloss
I wouldn't go over the top with gloss
but that's my personal taste the one
gloss I'm going to recommend is a rittle
one I love Rimmel clearly it's there
stay glossy lip gloss and blushing
Belgrade's it's like kind of a grey pink
but it's sheer enough I'm wearing today
that you can wear it with almost any
color and it just kind of adds just a
little bit of Sheen to it but it's not
too sticky it's not too glossy it's just
right in between and what I did is I
literally just dotted it on and kind of
rubbed it in with my finger and then
just let it be hopefully this is helpful
for you as you prepare for your big day
I'm so excited for you I know how
excited I was as I was preparing and
nervous but it'll all go well and you'll
be so glad when it's over because it
will have been an amazing day but it's
nice to get that stress done so if you
enjoy please subscribe for more and I'll
catch you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
