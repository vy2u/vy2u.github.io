morning Tyler yeah what's that when we
talk about why do you have eyeliner on
no he was a pirate last night and I gave
him all kinds of makeup removers and he
still can't get it off
classic it's so classic you're gonna
have that on for like four days time
this is the weirdest way to show this
there's Pinocchio he was the Beast I was
Bell and you were a pirate yeah yeah he
was with us last night with our friends
and he was just so worn out Oh usually
people no key oh yeah leave me alone oh
gosh how do I look I'm in my PJs
so I wanted to share with you guys my
threat up on boxing I picked out some
new stuff on there and this video is
actually sponsored by thredUP and I've
done so many videos with them I love
their site I have a 40% off link down
below if you are curious and you want to
give it a try so all of that's in the
description box but basically it's all
like new clothing that you can pick out
you can order it by size online which is
really nice because like if I go to
other consignment shops it's not as easy
to shop but this it's like easy I'm just
humble in my PJs shopping so I picked
out a bunch of stuff um these are a lot
of work clothes I like to wear dresses
and so I also got some sweaters and
stuff for like fall and winter and I'm
so excited so okay I have to admit I've
already opened this and I already looked
at everything because I was way too
excited but this I love it's from
forever 21 it's like a little like tunic
tight dress I guess it's more of a dress
but I thought it was so pretty it look
really pretty with this green sweater
here and just some leggings and boots
right and I'll put the original price of
these on the screen right now and then
what it was on thread it's so much
cheaper and then I got this green
sweater is so pretty it's from Chico's
and it's it she's really pretty it's
kind of a flyaway sweater I it's like a
3/4 length and I just love it and I
freaking love this car I feel like green
this shoot it brings like a power color
for me okay we're joining with coffee
and you guys like my it's a small world
mug from Disney
okay so next thing this is from Isaac
Mizrahi and this really is a tunic I
love wearing tunics with leggings to
work especially if they're longer where
they kind of cover your middle region
just so it's more appropriate I think
for work but I love this shade I think
it's just pretty this where is this from
Oh Old Navy and see a lot of these are
still new with tax as well like that
legitimately still have to tackle it but
it's just a really cute white dress it
has like the the layer under what did he
call it like a slip underneath it as
well and I just thought it was so pretty
and fresh looking I could wear it now
but I'll probably wait to wear it in
this spring but I just thought it was so
cute oh my gosh okay this is Lauren
Conrad and it's I just love pleats so
this has all these really cute pleats
but I love to the light kind of I don't
know what you call it but it's just a
really pretty top as well and how it
gathered up the natural waist as well I
just thought it was so pretty and
feminine next is this shirt from a brand
called susan graver
and it's just a really long white dress
shirt but it has it has this part on the
bottom that kind of ease out I just
thought that was so pretty and again I
think it'd be long enough to wear with
leggings which would just be gorgeous I
could wear it alone with a really pretty
like glam necklace I thought that'd be
cute this was the oh this is thicker
than I thought this is like really nice
material it's again more in Conrad but
again very spring and just happy so I
might wait to wear this we'll see but I
just thought it was so cute next I
always get leggings I swear to you I
feel like I wear leggings all the time
and so these were from Madewell
and I've never tried their leggings and
they feel like they are made well and
they feel like they're brand new but
just black leggings and then I got this
skirt just because you can never have
enough black in your wardrobe and this
is just a black skirt thought I could do
a lot with it I could even wear it for
like costumes for things like I feel
like I could be Minnie Mouse by having
this with like a red polka
shirt tucked into it you know what I'm
saying so I was really excited about
that do I get two pairs of leggings Oh
Jessica oh but these were brand new from
Ralph Lauren that's right and these had
these really pretty Ralph Lauren buttons
around the like near the ankles and
stuff yeah so I was just like these are
brand new a tag and super nice and I
love that had that cute detail with them
and then lastly I'll move that noisy
tissue paper this dress this was from
Old Navy and again it was clearly like
in a spring mood as I'm shopping for
fall but they were just so cute on there
so this is just a light spring dress
from Old Navy that I thought was really
really pretty as well I'm gonna be set
for next season
so that was everything in box so if
you're interested in thredUP like I said
I'll put the link for the 40% off code
down below if you're interested
did I say if you're interested twice yes
I did
but today's plan is to I've got a bunch
of boxes to unbox just generally I might
show you some of that I don't I've kind
of stopped showing PR on my channel
unless I'm like just reviewing it just
cuz I don't know those videos they're
kind of tricky and they're tricky to do
right and I know they have set some
people and other people love them so I'm
always torn so I've kind of stopped
doing PR unboxings on my channel but I
might show you some of the stuff if you
guys are interested but Tyler's making
some b-fast he said he's gonna make a
frittata like an egg white frittata and
I love them so I'm really excited and
what else are we doing today I'm just
editing a lot of videos this kind of an
in the house kind of a day which I love
and it's really cold and chilly outside
so it's just like a hot cocoa put a
sweater on and just like work around the
house I love these kinds of days anyone
else love this kind of a day so I'll
just kind of share my life with you for
the day I'm kind of reorganizing some of
my drawers and I'm really struggling
with bronzers like how to organize them
because some of them are so like big and
pumpkin do I have like lipstick all over
myself
lipstick cut anyway but some of them are
so big and awkward and so I do and then
I've got like palettes whereas like
with highlighter like well I guess these
are all kind of different sizes but yeah
and see I've got some big maybe I'll do
something similar to this and then like
my blush drawer it's a little easier
because I can kind of wrangle these and
then I just have larger one kind of
pushed over here this is that new
hourglass one that really is super
pretty I kind of like just swirling my
brush in the whole thing and applying
that as blush it's gorgeous
anyway so I'm trying to find a way I
guess I could stack similarly sized ones
this let me try it off-camera I'll show
you when I come up with all right I
guess that's a little bit better so I've
got at least these in the center here
and then just some of the awkward stuff
on the outside but I move some of the
palettes up here just I feel like the
palettes always get lost
I love these cabinets but see that's the
problem too like part of this is bronzer
part of that is bronze of a really I
should I feel like I should take the
blush one out and put that in there and
this is like an eye shadow one so good
you really are
I don't know for now I think I'm just
going to keep it all in here but this
contour one though I have really been
using a ton I hope my gosh I just
haven't been using it the past few weeks
that I love this stuff so I'm kind of
unboxing some of these things and this
is this brain called stroke of beauty
and apparently the two like cofounders
of this new brand are like from well
first of all he's like the
great-grandson of freaking Max Factor
which i think is just cool but they're
both like from Smashbox like they helped
create Smashbox and now they've created
this new brand so I'm kind of going
through a met to open some of these but
I think that's cool I've not heard of
this brand have you guys heard of it
lovely hubby would you make did you make
the frittata don't they say
Oh 18 kids but they were from oh my gosh
yes
also our favorite show is on in my on I
mean we're playing thanks for breakfast
handsome you're awesome our leaves are
finally changing I'm just getting some
fresh air it's kind of hot inside
because we have the heat on I feels like
I'm getting fresh air too but the leaves
are finally changing this was like the
weirdest fall where we live where it was
like hot and then it was just 40 degrees
and we're at like 40 degrees now every
day which is fine and it's totally I
mean it's cool and chilly but I just
feel like we were kind of gypped a
legitimate fall because I would bet
these leaves will fall really quickly
instead of kind of like a slow but it
does look really pretty right now
doesn't it I love it Pinocchio what are
you doing I'm sniffing and looking mom I
know it seems like we eat all the time
it's because we do but Tyler makes these
nachos I mean all it is is what tortilla
chips yeah yeah call me Jack cheese and
then you put it under the broiler for
like like two minutes maybe three it's
so it's so simple but it's just good but
then you dip it in sour cream and like I
love like olives so I'm throwing some of
those bad boys out there well when you
can see some of our fall decor so cute
what do we do with pumpkins when we're
done just throw them away like it's kind
of sad they're real carve the tiny
pumpkins take a baseball back to so I
also I just came back up I opened a
package from profusion
first of all these are like hefty
plastic kind of nicer in they're
humongous but they're really pretty like
this is like I don't know like it's
nicer than what I thought I don't know
that I'd ever even tried profusion but I
thought it was kind of a cheap brand and
it might be but these feel nicer than I
expected
I just watched some of these shadows
actually decently nice I mean I've got
this one swatch that one that one
and gleam and they're really pretty I'm
sure it's probably hit or miss with any
of these but my heart started beating
when I smelled this palette because it
smells like you know when you're a kid
and you get like Christmas presents and
like one of the things I would always
ask for like when I was like 9 or 10 and
I would just play with makeup at home
but I wouldn't like actually wear to
school or anything I would always ask
for those makeup kits that had like
everything all in one and they have the
same smell is this and I don't mean that
as an insult to profusion I just mean
like it just made my heart happy
so smelling it again I don't know how
else to describe it other than that but
I think this is kind of a cool combo of
colors I think the only thing like if I
were just using this I'd maybe want like
a kind of blending color for the crease
like maybe something a little bit
lighter than like that kind of a brown
but that's just me but this is their
sultry palette but they put all kinds of
stuff I don't think I'm gonna swatch all
of these right now but if you'd be
interested in a review let me know they
have this whole this was kind of crazy
this entire brow kit with like all the
different colors I thought that was kind
of cool and like this actually kind of
reminded me of those like Christmas sets
it's got like everything in it it
actually feels decently nice and then
they're like these really nice brushes
in here as well but it's got some brow
stuff highlights face stuff and of
course a bunch of shadows these showers
are totally speaking to me though oh I
like this also I just recently like
rediscovered where did I just put it I
just put it on my lips I just recently
rediscovered my EOS suite meant like I
forgot how much I loved this stuff and I
saw it in the store the other day and I
was like I haven't owned that in years
Wow probably a year it said it was the
new formulation and I was like no no no
but it honestly feels exactly the same
it has that perfect smell it just feels
so good on my lips I didn't like I don't
think I liked any other AOS lip balm
except for the sweet mint but this stuff
is the best and I'm so excited to have
it again cuz it's just like oh it's like
an old friend I'm clearly like really
like reminisce see lately I don't know
my room is a mess I want to reorganize
let me just show you this is the current
state of affairs I filmed the other day
and then I unboxed stuff so there's just
stuff everywhere but I want to get like
a separate desk for my computer to edit
at so that I don't have to have this
like visual clutter right here every
single time I'm editing like I'd rather
have a desk like between the windows
here with that on it and then separately
this could be you know where I get ready
slash film etc so I don't know I don't
know I need to think about it I want to
see if I can find like a small simple
desk kind of like this one
to also have for that but I just feel
like no matter even when it's clean it's
just like cluttered this is my current
state of affairs I already showed you
how messy it is but drinking some coffee
this time with creamer I usually drink
it black but later in the day
black coffee just doesn't sound good and
I like to throw some creamer in there
but oh no I'm wanting to redo my
everyday makeup drawers for my next
video and so the way I do it I know
people do it differently but I just take
absolutely everything out put it all
away like into my actual collection then
I go through my collection and pull out
things so I know some people like so
here's what used to be in there if I use
it but I'm like I'm not that organized
to be quite candid so that's just the
way I roll
so if the video that I'm if my new
everyday makeup drawer video is up by
the time you're actually in this vlog
I'll link it below I couldn't get those
swatches off could you Jess so a lot of
these are new products I just kind of
tossed in here like some color pops
supernova shadows that they sent which
this might be like one of the first
times I've gotten color pop PR I think
I've in the past gotten some but the one
thing I noticed is that they're like
almost all the same color even though
they are different shades I thought that
was kind of odd pretty super trendy
colors but they're like literally very
very similar I got some things from
pixie I want to try out things like that
oh you also see I've got some Maybelline
Gigi Hadid things that I'm also wanting
to try out for a video
that would be coming soon am I the only
person in the world that will like spend
time playing with makeup but like have
nothing on my face all day long but put
all kinds of stuff on my lips like I
will play with lipstick all day long
anyway um so I just put on you probably
can't tell but I just put on this Pixy
shea butter lip balm in the shade is
there a shade yeah sweet peach I feel
like I mean you can't like I feel like
that's gonna drive you guys crazy
it's just a lip balm but it's just like
comfortable and I feel like it makes my
lips look a little bit healthier than it
does like without it and it does have a
little bit of color let me see if I can
swatch it so there it is swatched you
see what I'm saying so I just feel like
that's such a pretty color it's like the
perfect lip balm for fall too so I'm
really enjoying that I'm sorry that this
whole vlog is me without makeup this is
real life I just like if it's a day that
I don't have to work I really like
giving my skin a break and I'm
definitely giving it a break and I'm
pretty sure tonight I'm gonna try to get
a bubble bath and do a sheet mask and
all that before heading to work tomorrow
super fun just put on another one and my
hair gets crazier I just bought this the
other day the Revlon kiss plumping lip
cream in the shade apricot silk I like
this one even more this really is like a
lip gloss though it's just a squeezy
tube and then I just applied it with my
finger but I feel like it's a really
pretty color it definitely has more
color to it but it's starting to get
that kind of minty tingly feel nothing
too crazy but it's definitely there
which I don't mind I'm diggin it I like
this color a lot buddy and replacing the
faucet here and so I'm under to say
business and then he just comes right up
and lays on
he's playing on a pin there feel crazy
in the shadows bookkeeping fellows Kelly
buddy you can't lay there oh he's so fat
he's not planning on living Oh
Tsar's gonna nap here the light is
really warm it's not going anywhere
good boy you crazy
it's 30 seconds I just hoped I might
pull something out and he walked him
back up from the Big Bang oh you're so
smooth
rotten yogi okay so I just tried out
some of these like statement lip
products from bareMinerals this
statement matte lip cream in VIP look at
that shape right there that is like oh

formula seems kind of interesting off to
try it it dries really quickly that's
