currently I am editing a drugstore
makeup haul video and it's a ton of like
brand new things that I found and I was
so excited about them like the
Maybelline lip gloss palette I knew I
had heard of that one but when I found
at the store I was pretty excited to try
it and then I think it's Maybelline -
Maybelline has two different like
limited edition holiday I have trouble
saying limited edition limited edition
thanks too much limited edition holiday
palettes that they came out with they
have like a quad of eyeshadow a blush a
highlight a lip gloss and a eyeliner so
I have those too and so I'm that's in
this video and there's a couple other
things but those were kind of the three
standout items that I was really excited
about but I made a green smoothie this
morning and all that I put in it
cuz I'm I can be kind of weird about
mixing things together that are like
from different spheres like vegetables
with fruits but I just make it at least
today all I made it with was frozen
strawberry banana kale or spinach is
happen to have kale today um what else
I put ground flaxseed in it and OH
almond milk I use almond milk because
I'm lactose intolerant you could use
regular milk I made Tyler one this
morning as well before he went to work
and his just has regular milk in it but
they're pretty tasty if you're picky you
can also like because this isn't super
sweet but you could also use like
powdered peanut butter I put in
sometimes too you can use vanilla yogurt
or even just flavored yogurt if you like
that cuz that'll add that'll make it a
lot more sweet and like smoothie like
but they're not bad and they're kind of
something you get used to so if you've
never tried it and you've been like on
the fence it's worth trying because you
might be surprised my compadre you just
 look at so grump you just help him
mommy edit and there he goes always with
the buck always licking things
gross you just can hang out with mommy
don't like me after licking that cross
no offense buddy you're too but you're
stinky so cute don't bite me Oh puppy
how's work going
yes'm it's better now home you munch
with my wife so now it's turned around
it's great day what have you got on your
ear
Pinocchio's got some kind of food or
something on his here either dippin easy
you didn't know what's going on with
there too big he does dip them and like
everything he sniffs yeah he comes over
in their dresser yeah we live very close
to where he works so he's able to you
cut you get to come home for lunch every
day but usually I'm not here cuz I
usually take this guy out yeah yeah
needs a lunch and go back so I'm getting
ready right now hello and I have just
realised I'm like breaking out terribly
like right here and I feel like I've
been trying out a lot of foundations and
I'm just everyday I've been wearing
foundation and I need to give my skin a
little bit of a break so today I'm using
just this BB cream from dr. jart that
I've had for a while and I it's my
favorite BB cream I've ever tried it's
really simple it has a little bit of
coverage but to provide a little extra
coverage I'm using my favorite it
cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination I love it so I'm hoping if
I give my skin a break over the next
week that will be exactly what it needs
to kind of give it so I am currently
headed to the gym and I'm meeting Tyler
there after work so he I think he's like
literally a car or two behind me but and
after that we are gonna for real go
grocery shop and we mentioned that we
might in our last vlog but we never did
and I was looking at some recipes in
this cookbook we have that's like global
recipes cuz like that's our favorite
thing to do ever it's cook different
cuisines from around the world because
there's just different spices that
people use things like that so that is
what we are going to we're gonna get
some ingredients for that and and just
regular stuff we eat but yeah so I'm
looking forward to working out it's been
a couple days and I kids
use a run and it's like 20 degrees
outside so running outside is just not
gonna so we are done working out and
we've been shopping at the grocery store
like an hour nap and of course naturally
we get I don't know what we can see wine
and spices and cheese
we also got some other things for like
Thanksgiving actually a lot of it's for
Thanksgiving that is adorable
cowboy that's so cute that is my daddy
so um we are gonna check out and then
what's for dinner Tyler cereal good
morning okay so it is Tuesday morning
and Tyler just left for work and I we
had cream of wheat I love cream of wheat
and I was thinking about like why do I
like cream of wheat so much it's so
simple and all I put in is like a little
bit of salt and a little bit about her
and that's it but I think I I think the
reason I like it so much is because I
had it so much as a kid it was one of my
favorites so I guess it's just the taste
of it was my favorite done anyway I
don't know it makes me think of being a
kid basically is what I'm trying to say
so it just gives me the warm fuzzies
when I eat it and Tyler it's kind of new
to him so he's still I think he likes it
anyway we got this little puppy pup
aren't you doing Pinocchio mmm anyway so
we're gonna see what terrors we can get
into today I think I want to film a
Black Friday deals like beauty deals
video today I'm hoping so I might get
ready now a lot of times I get other
things done then get ready later in the
day but I think I'm gonna get ready
early on like a normal human being
and in film that hopefully because I've
been looking in a lot of the Black
Friday ads are already out and a lot of
them you can buy online I haven't
decided if I'm going to go out for Black
Friday for real or not I it's kind of
every other year I do and I don't and
every year it's a pretty it can be fun
it really can be fun especially if you
do like breakfast afterwards it's just
fun so I might ask my mom and my sisters
what they're doing because I've I think
I've gone I don't know if I've ever gone
with my mom but I think it'd be fun so
we
know what cream of wheat is this is it
okay so I feel like I look like a
Kardashian today I'm like okay high bun
that's not crazy for me that's normal
fur vest that's new I'm just giggling
wearing this I can't decide if I like
actually like it or if I totally hate it
you guys ever have like like I'm trying
to be daring but I just feel kinda silly
but also it's like this softest warmest
thing I've ever worn so I don't know I
can't so I'm about to film and I was
just looking up a bunch of Black Friday
deals and there really is a lot of good
stuff out there like Sephora has their
classic $10 deals where it's usually
like two or three piece little sets from
a lot of high-end brands and they're um
they really are amazing deals and what I
like about it is that you don't have to
go to the store you can just do it
online which is nice since Black Friday
is like scary although now it's just
like blurring the lines between Cyber
Monday and Black Friday it's like cyber
and it's just I don't know anyway so the
reason I'm filming in my bathroom these
are some skincare things that I'm
getting rid of I've had and I like was
trying to use this in my face was like
red after using it and I've never had
that experience with a any sort of mask
so I looked it up on the Beauty pedia
that I always talked about I can link
below and it said like really the glint
and most of the glam glow things really
are not highly rated by dermatologists
and people that know what they're
talking about so you know they have all
these big claims but they really aren't
doing stuff for your skin and in some
case they contain not all of them but
some of them contain irritants that can
mess with your skin this one wasn't on
there but I used it once it's like a
honey peel-off mask I just didn't like
it so I'm just kind of cleaning out not
truly decluttering but these are just
some things that have been in my little
drawer here tons of polish choice that I
just needed to get rid of they've been
sitting in there and I don't I don't
want to use them anymore
so I'm currently trying to film and
trucks keep driving by a lot of people I
guess are moving in today I don't know
what is it Tuesday it seems like a weird
data anyway but um I'm still just
giggling but it's so warm and I
discovered that it has pockets if you're
wondering where I got it I got it at
Burlington Coat Factory they had a bunch
so if you have one near you this one was
like $30 but they had some number like
20 so I mean it just kind of depends but
the brand was all of an oak which is the
nice brand so I was like okay okay um
but right now I am filming my Black
Friday deals and I'm so excited I did a
bunch of research this morning I'm
feeling good about it and there are some
really good deals out there so I am I'm
gonna be buying things too when it comes
to it but if the video is up I will link
it below cuz it's I'm pretty bit so a
little sneak peek at what just came in
the mail today but this might I haven't
filmed this haul yet obviously it just
came in the mail but I don't know when
I'm gonna film it cuz I've already
filmed my two videos today and I'm like
I just put away all the equipment and
it's quite a to-do so I'm not sure when
this will be filmed and go up it might
be a while to be honest but it was
supposed to be like a Sephora vib haul
video but it took forever to get my
stuff and I was like that's fine so I'm
just gonna do a Sephora haul when I get
the chance obviously but just a sneak
peek some of them are actually like
Christmas gifts for me from Tyler but he
said well just well just order it and
then you just can't have it til
Christmas so like there's a perfume in
there that I can't have till Christmas
that's fine anyway um also so this fur
vest he is obsessed with it everywhere I
go he follows me and then he lays next
to it I think he thinks it's his mom
tonight we're having Kenyan well first
of all before I even tell you around
this is a book I got for Tyler called
global kitchen since obviously let's
travel and we both like to cook so we're
having these mashed peas and potatoes
with corn apparently this is a
traditional dish in Kenya which is
awesome so we have like half of it here
and half of it here
not gonna match that and then the other
thing we're having I'll show you one
here yummly we always get our recipes
from Jung Lee but honey did your home
chicken but it's got like um it's in the
oven already curry powder and paprika
and stuff and Dijon mustard and honey
and red pepper tiny I made Tyler try the
sauce of it and he was so good so we're
excited but that's gonna be it for this
vlog so we will see you guys in an
excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
