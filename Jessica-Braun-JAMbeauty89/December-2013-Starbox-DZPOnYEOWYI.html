video today ladies because um it's just
one thing I wanted to show you this is
the the star box for December sorry my
brain is like shut off it's almost
Christmas my brain is asleep okay um so
it comes in his adorable packaging we
like the rose gold and then the little
green thing because it's almost
Christmas and they did send me this for
free I want you to know that um but holy
crap this box was awesome it only had
one thing in it and I was like what
except for then I was like wait this is
awesome and better than five things
combined it was these star looks what
was it called it's there 15 shades
shadow-like palette and is in the shade
I know it said it somewhere I'm like the
name of the do Buddha do it is in oh I
love the title it's called the New
Year's Eve 2014 palette how fun New
Year's like this a lot like shimmery and
this is the palette bump but a bump up
uh this is I mean literally I got this
like a week ago I can't stop using it
and it's weird because it's literally
especially like this row right here are
like all of my favorite colors like ever
and then this shade right here I wear
literally every day this is an everyday
color these two right here this is
gorgeous this is gorgeous that silver is
okay I'm gonna swatch some of my
favorites I'm gonna swatch that silver
one oh yeah I'm gonna swatch I'm like
gonna pick and shoes here that's a good
one
I'll swatch that one I'll swatch trying
to be picky here oh I'm gonna swatch
that dark purple one look at these
colors oh my gosh they are so stunning
and they say all day even without a
primer
these are freaking insane and the thing
is like like I'd said in my last
Starbucks video for November what
I can link below for you guys if you
want to check it out I hadn't really
heard a lot about their brain I tried
out some products from like empty bags
that they said and I really liked them
and I was like dang so these shadows are
literally some of the best and like I
said you don't even need a primer with
them that's so rare and I just didn't
like obsessed with this palette it's
funny because when I opened it my sister
was sitting next to me and she was like
is that like for me for Christmas I'm
like no no way honey I'm keeping this
one for myself I have tons of palettes
but this one just kicked all of those
other palettes out of the water like oh
my gosh I just I'm obsessed with this oh
my gosh I'm a dummy it says the name of
the pallet on the back New Year's Eve
2014 anyway the thing is this retails I
think they said it's $99 but I got it in
my star box and I think that you can
still go on their website and buy this
even though you weren't like even if you
weren't subscribed to the star box which
is the subscription-based thing you can
still buy this after the fact so I will
leave all the info of how much it costs
to be a subscriber to the star box how
much this would cost if you bought it
now because seriously you guys this is
amazing it covers every like color you
would want I don't even like it's got
some matte shadows here it's got a matte
black and a matte brown a matte like
chocolate brown they're a lot of shimmer
some little pops of color in there it is
literally perfect
I cannot get over it and thin and easy
to travel with I just love it I need to
simmer down because I'm serious like I
liked last month's star box but this one
I like even better I think I would
rather get a really awesome product like
one then a few that I might use might
not I really like this one okay anyway
so I hope that was helpful for you guys
like I said all the info liked about
that will be below and I'll catch you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
