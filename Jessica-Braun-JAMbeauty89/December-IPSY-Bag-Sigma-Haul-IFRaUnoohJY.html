kind of a haul it's uh what's in my Ipsy
bag for December and also some products
that Sigma sent me to try out that I'm
just gonna show you what they are and
then also um some new boots that I got
which actually I'd mentioned in my last
haul that I was waiting on them and they
finally did it
so um first of all guys this is my hair
naturally curly just I was realizing I
have not worn my hair naturally
currently in a video I don't think ever
and this is how I used to wear my hair
like this just every single day of my
life
so I decided to do it and it's just it's
so easy I forgot how easy it is so you
wouldn't see this a little more often
um plus my boyfriend is always every
time I wear my hair naturally curly he's
always like please wear it like that
more often so I think I'm going to UM if
you haven't noticed I got a pug leg in
the video he wanted to be a part honey
look at him struggling he's like stop
holding me that way anyway um okay so
where to begin
we'll just let's start with the Sigma
products because the right thing here in
front of me they sent me two different
brushes they sent me the P 82 brush
which is an eye shadow brush I'm
assuming it's called a precision round
brush I've used it I used it for kind of
like a buffer color today and it's kind
of I don't know it's a little large for
my liking for my eyes so not a big fan I
don't know I mean I like the way the
brush is but I don't think I like this
actual brush are you gonna be okay Simba
are you gonna be okay buddy but anyway
so I also got the Sigma f80 too and it's
one of their bigger face brushes that I
liked I used it for foundation I like it
I think I liked my angled one better
which is the f-84 I think it's very
similar it's angled I think I like that
one better than this but they're nice
brushes and then they sent me one of
their eyeshadow bases and persuade I've
been using it certainly hold onto the
shadow and it's just a very neutral
color I mean I like it it's not I don't
know that it's my favorite yet but I've
we used it a few times then they also
send me an eye shadow that I would never
wear it some in the shade at least say I
have no idea how to say that but it's
like a brown deep brown color which I
just don't wear this very often
you know what no it's like purple or
bright maybe it's like a purple I don't
think I realize there's the like a
finger swatch I guess it is more of a
purple again though I don't think I'd
wear that color very often it's
definitely pigmented but anyway so
that's that that's what they sent me so
just chill out you guys hear him hitting
the little thing he wants to leave my
room hold on okay so those were the
products of Sigma sent me so on to
what's in my Ipsy bag for this month
they always come in this $10 a month
it'll be linked below this year's theme
was it just says celebration which I
guess makes sense for December there's a
lot of holidays going on this month okay
so I actually really like the bag this
month it's this cute black one that's
kind of almost like a quilted pattern
but it's a really cool feel and I kind
of liked it the zippers like a third of
the way down into the bag it's really
cute it just feels more well-made than
some of their past bags that's for sure
the inside is like this deep red
isn't that pretty for the holidays I
just love this so it came with some
strip lashes from Andrea Brown drea
however you want to say it um I don't
see like the number or anything of Oh
dub number 33 it's right there right in
front of me I usually don't wear fake
lashes however we'll see I'll certainly
hold on what came with some adhesive of
course as well um it also came with the
pop Beauty eyeshadow trio and
smokin'-hot it's like a silver gray and
then like a deeper black I don't know
that I'll keep this because these are
colors I wear so I might just leave it
closed because it might be in a giveaway
or maybe I'll give it to someone for the
holidays we will see um came with this
tiny tiny little nail polish it's like
yellow and black it's I guess the brand
is star really and it's buzz buzz or
business I don't know we'll see how like
opaque
is it seems odd that it's so small it's
like just a glitter this would have been
great my high school colors were like
golden black it would have been great
for that back in the day um okay
also it came with the be a bombshell
it's called the one stick and it's in
the shape flustered I don't know if it
supposed to be like an arse multiple
type of thing it's certainly like the
size of one I'm assuming this is like a
cheek stain lip whoa okay
let's see how this like blends so I'm it
could be yeah I'm assuming that's what
it's supposed to be for like a cheek
stain and a lip stain oh my gosh my
hands are gonna get a hand stain but
it's it's nice and big it's a color it's
a color it's red we'll see oh my gosh
well I've certainly made a mess of it I
know that much oh my gosh when will I
learn to keep baby wipes near me when
will I learn I go through this every
time I speak video okay it also came
with a lip NYX lipstick it's one of the
round ones in the shade sunflower this
is lip smacking fun colors
and it's I mean really it's a red do you
guys see my aunt look at this mess
that's only from two products what's
wrong with me well swatch it right there
it's kind of like a Coralie red really
it's pretty it's this one I know you
guys don't like look at this it looks
like it's a joke look at my hand I'm a
mask oh I have to leave for rehearsal in
like 8 minutes so I need to like get
this going for real so I really like the
bag honestly I don't really like any of
the products the lashes I won't wear the
shadows I won't wear I probably won't
wear this nail polish probably won't
wear that lipstick we'll see and then
this one stick I need to just try out
and see how I like it but not in love
with any of the products I like the bag
a lot here's the kicker though I had
some oopsy points that you can get for
referring friends and for reviewing the
products you get in your bag
and so I cash them in if you will for a
Beautyblender and it just came like in a
little bag but it's a regular Beauty
Blender just their original it's the
normal size when it gets wet it gets
bigger and then it also fame is like a
little sample
eyes of their cleanser which I've never
used so I'm excited to try but gosh I
would pay $10 for this are you kidding
me
these movies are like 20 bucks and my
Beauty Blender star like all gone now
because one ripped and the other is just
old I had to throw out so for these
alone I think it's worth it but the rest
of them will see you might see some of
those in a giveaway soon I don't know
speaking of giveaways I have two going
on I'll link both below one is for like
bath bombs and bath products and the
other giveaway is for some makeup from
Pilate Oh or Palladio at beauties so so
the last thing I want to show you guys
were the boots that I got I got them
through Ebates
so I got like $10 cash back from it but
their Madden girl boots and but I got
them from the website shoes.com which
I'd never ordered from um there are
these like kind of like deep brown topi
I don't know what to call because it is
like a brown but it's almost got like a
gray tone to it which is exactly what I
was looking for they have this buckle
detail my favorite detail though let me
show you look at that
oh isn't that so cute with like the
studs on both sides and then the red
with the bronze if ER oh my gosh like
these are exactly what I was looking for
I can't express to you enough and it was
a really good deal I got on Cyber Monday
and then like I said three basic guys
$10 cash back so it's kind of a win-win
situation there but really excited to
wear those boots I'm thinking about
making myself wait this might sound
silly but I'm thinking of what making
myself wait until Christmas to let
myself wear these new things I bought
for myself cuz I don't this is the first
year I've ever bought things for myself
in December really but I really wanted
these boots and it was such a good deal
and then same with like my recent haul
with some clothes I might make myself
work although this I got at Kohl's and
it was in my haul and it is so
comfortable and so cute so that when I
did not wait on set them maybe but
whatever anyway so that is all I should
probably go to rehearsal huh but I will
catch you guys very soon and I hope that
was fun and
yeah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
