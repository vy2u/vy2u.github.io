figure I would take you along with me
these are some headbands I'm going to
get rid of that I've had since probably
the beginning of college that I really
never ever wear headbands I am keeping a
few which I'll show you in a second but
these are some things that I've already
gone through that I'm going to sell in
an Instagram sale and honestly you might
be watching this after I've already had
the sale so and then this is a little
barrette I bought from shop lately but
I've never ever worn it and I really
don't think I ever am going to it's so
cute but it's just not something I wear
so and then some other little hair
things this is a jewel mint necklace
that I'm going to sell that I got once
and I just don't wear it it's so cute
but I usually don't wear chunky I mean
look how beautiful that is but I just
don't wear chunky pieces that often so
that's another one I think I'm going to
sell this purse as well it's a Nine West
or nine and co little shoulder what does
that call crossbody bag it's really
really cute has a lot of compartments
but again I have a lot of these types of
bags so I just don't have a use for it
anymore so those are some things I've
already gone through I also already went
through my earrings and these are some
ones I think I'm going to get rid of and
sell a lot of these were from shop
lately comm one of my favorite sites and
then these are the earrings I'm going to
keep I've got a lot I mean not I'm some
people have way more than I do but I'm
happy with what I have I've got kind of
like one of each color that I would want
and some kind of like goopy ones and
then some like really fun ones and yeah
so I really like it and then I have a
lot of necklaces on here that I wear all
the time I also keep a lot of my
necklaces in my what's that called
closet there this is also where I keep a
lot of my this is an old jewelry box
I've had for so long the stones are like
coming off where I have my two watches
I'm kind of some studs and rings that I
wear and then just my bracelets that I
actually wear I used to own a lot and I
recently sold a bunch of those as well
because I was only wearing these so why
keep the other ones if I'm only wearing
these fuse so just decluttering so
that's a good feeling so now I was going
to ask for your help because well I
guess not really your
we can't really respond but I'm going to
go through my makeup it's kind of a
complete mess and I planned on doing a
makeup collection video really soon so
I'm going to go through and get rid of
some stuff first then I'm going to
reorganize it all so I'm going to decide
some things that I want to get rid of
now let's see this is actually a new
container I got from a company called by
allegory which you'll see in my makeup
collection video so these are both two
Mac Lester's I'm not going to get rid of
I'm not going to get rid of my Tarte
ones or my Mac MSF's that I love so
those are certainly staying this is my
favorite highlighter this one I like but
I just don't wear that often but I
really do like it and I need to give it
some more love so I might hold on to
that one a little bit longer okay stay
matte I wear all the time NYX and Mac
this one I don't wear all that often so
I'm going to think about that one I love
my Sonia Kashuk cream these are kind of
the land of my favorite bronzers hula
tart I like that pixie one this one I
don't wear as often but when I'm really
really fair skinned it's nice it's an
elf pressed powder but maybe I will get
rid of that one this cargo one I'm going
to get rid of because it's really orange
on me oh my gosh really orange this one
mm I might get rid of this one too I've
seen a lot of love but I just don't wear
it ever anymore because I have ones that
I like better these
okay amber sent me these I really like
this but the only thing is that that um
I can't even open it that really um
shimmery bronzer I don't use that often
and I don't you just really don't reach
for this very often I don't know I feel
bad though when things are given to me
it's really really hard to get rid of
them because it's I you know what I mean
I mean it's like almost it's hard it's
awkward but I'm gonna think about that I
might I think anything that someone gave
me I might text them I might text amber
and ask if she wants them back or you
know what I mean if it is something I'm
actually gonna get rid of this Milani
baked bronzer
I really haven't used much so I feel
like I should give it a little bit more
love too I might give that one a little
more like this is the elf tone
correcting powder that I love so I'm
keeping that let's go over here my
Pilate Oh blush
love these Milani blushes I don't know I
like them but if they're not like I mean
they're good but I have so many I really
do
how many does a girl really need I don't
know I might keep like I really like
Dulce pink I might get rid of Luminoso
so we'll add that to the pile this NYX
blush and and pinched I love this is a
tart Dollface I love what is under here
oh I love that elf one these are my two
from the balm I need to reorganize my
elf this is that like duo keeping these
this I like but again I have a lot of
highlighters I'm going to think about
that one too so I have all these cream
blushes again amber sent me these and I
love them but I don't wear all of them
that often so I might go through the
colors and decide which ones I like you
have five different colors and I kind of
went through and I picked out colors
like orchid hush that I don't have a
blush this color so I'm going to keep
that one what is this one called it's
hard to read it on there fresh pink I
think I'm going to keep and then this
darker one pink frosting I think these
two this peach one just doesn't show up
on me it's called rose petal it's funny
it looks peach to me and then this one
pink plum I just it doesn't show up on
me as well either so I think these two
are gonna go on my pile and I'm going to
keep these three okay so I can clean
you're already um let's see back here
this I have never used this I bought
this on clearance I literally I think i
swatched it once so I'm gonna get rid of
that this is my stay matte powder in a
darker color I'm going to keep same with
that NYX one I like both of these so I
think I'm gonna hold on to these this
one I don't wear as often but I think
I'm gonna keep it because that's the
only liquid blush I have and for
experimenting and things I think it
would be a good thing we keep this is my
ELF HD powder and yellow which I still
use this at my under eyes something to
keep that so I think I feel satisfied
with what I got rid of in this
or here okay now this drawer let's see
my all-nighter spray I'm going to keep
um let's see I'm trying to this benefit
one it's in no pressure it came in a kit
I think I might get rid of it's a color
I just never ever use I really don't I
use the other one all the time but
that's not one that I use the oh this
wasn't even with probably because I
never use it
it's the L'Oreal strawberry blonde one
and I never use it because it looks
terrible on me I don't know what it is
about it looks really bad so I'm going
to get rid of that one too um got my wet
and wild two shadows I think I'm going
to keep what color tattoos all my things
are all mixed up and not in the right
places like all my color tattoos aren't
in here either
um toughest Oh bad to the bronze and
gold gold I might get rid of old gold
because I again don't use it very often
let's see mmm you might keep those these
are some more of the 24-hour ones
what shades do I have here I love I
think most of these I love this one is
endless prone oh I like that one too
I think I like all of those so those are
keepers the I'm thinking about getting
rid of this one it's a mica beauty one
in sorry I'm like way too close in
bronze and it's just a really pretty so
I'm going to think about getting rid of
that one too
let's see thinking about getting rid of
this philosophy quad if I can open it
let's see I like it but I just don't
wear it all that often it's really nice
but again I really just don't so then
these are all ones that I've already
opened I think I'm going to hold onto
for now this one keeps showing up in
products I regret buying videos the
waterproof version but all of these are
still fine to use these I use this
covergirl one the NYX ones I think I'll
hold onto these for a little while
although sparkle nude no I think I'll
hold on to it because I do like those so
this now I need to go through my liners
here
this Palladio liner is good but it's a
color I'll never wear taupe I've only
used it like once is this the one mm mm
that one's fine where's this starlooks
one I like but I just don't use it as
often it's a really pretty color but I
don't have a very good use for it it's
like this pretty purple maybe I will
though because I have I did use it for a
while and I really liked it this is
really hard to do dump these and look at
them all my black ones I'm going to keep
I'm just I told myself I'm not going to
buy any more black I'm going to work
through the black ones that I already
have so I have four there and there's
one eye but what's almost done with so
those I'm working through because I wear
black every day now the kind of gold
bronzy ones will put their green ones
anything with sparkle I think I'm going
to get rid of this one has a little bit
of sparkle in it because it just ends up
this one has a little sparkle too and I
think I am going to get rid of it I know
I keep going back and forth but I think
I am the star lips one this one is just
brown and I like it and I don't wear
brown all that often this one is too I
think these are almost done so I think
I'm going to finish these up this is one
of my favorites this essence so those
I'm going to keep this blue one and this
purple one of the only ones I have of
that color now the green I think I'm
just going to pick one which I think I'm
going to pick the Jordana 1 the Jordana
ones are amazing get rid of the Milani
and then liquid eyeliner yes I like that
one and then this one let me swatch this
for a sec so yeah I think I just don't
have a need for it I have plenty so
these four are going to get rid of and
that's my growing pile it's exciting so
let's see
sorry I've got like my computer right
there getting in the way this one might
look empty because I got a new lipstick
holder back there and so now the
lipsticks that used to be here are no
longer there I cannot wait to reorganize
all this so let us see so let's start
here with like foundations the okay I
know right away these two I just really
don't like either one of them I really
wish I did I've tried them I brought the
Maybelline one with me on a vacation
where it was like less makeup but it
they both make me look like a greaseball
so I'm going to get rid of those
this one amber sent me to and I've tried
it and it just doesn't have much
coverage it really breaks my heart
because it really doesn't for me it
doesn't end up working so I might ask
for about that um this one I love this
my Revlon Colorstay I love this one's a
new one for me that I'm still kind of
trying out but I really do like it
this one I'm still trying out this one I
really actually did like this I just
need to finish it up it's almost gone
but it's right now it's too dark for me
so there's not much I love the wet and
wild cover all and then this one I like
as well clearly I haven't been wearing
it because it's too dark for me so in
the summertime this one and the rim of
one Alma to try and use up and then
these are my two different shades of the
elf foundation the mineral foundation
and I absolutely absolutely love that oh
man I love it so those I'm definitely
keeping back here lip liners
I've got Pilate oh dear Edna pink so
keeping those these I love I love honey
I love which ones this one this is
actually got recently cherish and then
my okay I'm keeping those this is one I
just got and I think I'm just going to
get rid of it I don't like the way it
wears on my lips and I wish I did I just
got this in an empty bag but I think I'm
just gonna call it a loss ahead of time
because I really can't stand it on my
lips this is the Smashbox wanna use I
use all of those oh these are this is
like my favorite these four right here
like all favorites of mine this one I
recently just tried to give a shot you
probably saw but I don't I don't like it
on my lips I'm too I guess I'm too pale
for it cuz it really doesn't look great
on me and then these two little trial
wands I think I'm gonna keep because I
need to just these are perfect to throw
on my purse I need to actually do that
now let us see here back here it's kinda
harder to see I have some sugar once
I've had all kinds of random stuff
chapstick it's all beat up but all of
these I grabbed for at different times
and that is true these I could probably
get rid of I never use these NYC lip
slider tins they're nice but I just
don't ever use them hmm anything else
here that
should get rid of I like having aquaphor
I like those two lipsticks I think I'm
going to leave that as it is now
palettes I don't know that there's any
I'm going to get rid of because to be
honest I don't have as much as most
people I know that's still a lot I know
that I'm not an idiot
but like the star looks one I love I
love this oh my gosh I love all of these
my naked palettes and yeah I really
don't think there's any I can get rid of
well I could get rid of that one but
look at those colors aren't they're so
pretty I think I might hold onto it for
a little while longer cuz I really do
love those colors these Sonia Kashuk
ones I'm definitely keeping it I love my
Shady Lady so I think that's that for
that drawer there and this is all like
haircare I these are all things I like
genuinely use everyday I've got like my
curling wand my straightener and oh
these were the the headbands that I'm
keeping by the way I keep in this ole is
the Victoria's Secret like gift box I
got and then I covered it with the
construction paper so it wasn't
see-through but I've just got one of
those bun things I literally am keeping
like two headbands because they're cute
and then this one my niece made me so of
course I'm keeping that and I just have
random ribbons I have a this is funny
I'm wearing a shirt that's like Minnie
Mouse and then I also have like a
ribbons or but I wear those like in
Disney because of course I do
all right I'm a total of Disney nerd so
I know you guys are probably so dizzy
I'm sorry so those are all hair things
I'm actually keeping even though I
really don't reach for these all that
often but everyone's smile I do bottom
drawers like my nail care I don't have
too many actual polishes here but
they're this one I never wear there's
just some glitter ones I don't wear all
that often cuz I really I love glitter
ones but they're so hard to get off I
really just don't wear them often I
don't really wear this color too often
I'm gonna think about that one these are
my little Minnie Mouse collection ones
that I love hmm oh I don't really wear
this glitter one either
these NYX glitters here I haven't worn
in years so that might be a good those
might be good to get rid of um let's see
I think I guess I can kind of use these
this heart is nail this one I'm thinking
about getting rid of it's a such feet
base but I've only used a few times I
really didn't love it I might try it
again with such feet I need to get some
but I think I am gonna get rid of this
every day makeup drawer look how
overgrown it gets like literally in a
matter of like a week I just posted one
recently and it just I will grab another
product and throw it in here I mean it
this is a mess so I really however most
of these are products that are in either
new to me or that I love so I don't know
that there's really gonna be anything
you know what I was retrying this out
this is the elf shimmering facial whip I
think I'm gonna get rid of it I tried a
few more times and I don't know I used
to love this stuff but for some reason
lately the way it's been catching the
light on my face I don't like it and I
don't think I realized it earlier on so
I'm gonna get rid of that one let's see
here I will use all of these things like
crazy this is that new lip balm I got
from Mika from an Ipsy bag yeah all of
these are things I use mm-hmm this one I
might just get rid of this one ahead of
time and set yeah be one that came in a
few but it's way too dark for me I don't
even think it'll be the right shade even
when I'm semi tan in the summer so I'm
gonna think about that one um is that
these are all keepers I think all of
those are keepers too back there it's
just like random beauty blenders and
things like that so I think everything
else in there is keeper in this one mmm
this is kind of like my skincare slash
like face drawer kind of what anyway
this Palladio one they sent me and I
really did like it but I think I think
this might have been something that
helped break me out I had a really bad
like skin reaction for a while and I
wonder if this was part of it so I I'm a
little too scared to try it
it's basically full and there's a pump
so it's really good but I really think
it might have broken me out so I think
I'm going to get rid of this one um this
mark I kind of like that I'm going to
keep that these primers here I never use
that gal primer in the Sephora primer I
don't even think I ever have used I
never use this NYX eyebrow shaper
love I love concealers I use all of
those I use all of those my beauty
blender those are all used by me I only
use this a few times and I found another
thing that I'm using now for my eyes so
I think I might get rid of this too it
was only used like twice the rest of
this stuff I'll do use so I think that
might be all for that drawer this one is
a ring look how I need to clean I really
am excited to get rid of some of the
stuff though so I keep like tissues and
baby wipes um-hmm I get rid of these
things that I just genuinely never use I
use that from time to time I use that
when I travel um I have like random like
and you see I just need to get rid of
these that I use when I travel I like
that actually a lot I think that I might
this is one thing I might get rid of I
haven't tried it yet but I don't know I
have so many deep conditioners I'm like
do I even want to try another thing I
don't know that I do this is a shine
spray I use it for a while smells
incredible but I might give this a few
more tries actually here is my like
candle drawer there's nothing I'm going
to get rid of in there this is like my
drawers of things that I haven't opened
yet or I'm not using currently and I bet
there's a few things in here I could get
rid of this it's not quite the same as
my vitamin E cream that I love it's nice
but it's not the same so I think it's
full I'm gonna get rid of that these
lashes I just don't wear lashes so this
facial mask I have so many do I really
need another know I really don't these
are all ones I want to try out a lot of
some of these are either old favorites
that it's a backup that someone sent me
or they're ones I still haven't tried
out but I can't open that many mascaras
if so many mascara is already open I'm
trying to be patient but it is really
difficult
this is one of the Diane tacky bath
products but I have so many so I think I
might get rid of this or sell it I don't
know I don't know we're going to see
this I want to try this em cosmetics
mascara out let's see here I have a lot
of things that I am just still wanting
to try but there's only so much me and
so much makeup I can put on in the day
you know what I mean I'm definitely
going to keep those I love this the
sleep aromatherapy lotions I love I
might get rid of this actually I love
the forever add scent but the lotion
scent is not quite the same as like the
body spray so it's very odd I mean it
still smells good but it's a little off
to me compared to the spray and I like
this very better so I think I might get
rid of this as well um I have so much
random stuff it's comical it really is
I'm okay I'm thinking about getting rid
of this one I don't know though I might
put this in my gym bag because I do love
the smell but the rest of the stuff is
all stuff that's backed up like my
friend just got me this I'll be using
once I run out of mine these are all
sanitizers that I will be using all this
stuff umm-hmm these are all travel size
things that I actually do use when I
travel that subscriber sent to me which
I appreciated
so I think that's everything in that he
moly look at all of this stuff that's
crazy oh and I was thinking all of these
little perfume samples I think I might
just get rid of - I I keep them as if
I'm ever going to use them and I think
like once I've used one like it's just I
have my favorites over there there's no
reason for me to go back you know
looking over here at my other nail
polish hmm this is gonna be difficult
again a lot of these were sent to me and
I love a lot of these but some of them I
like but I just am NOT reaching for or I
have really similar colors this I use
this white one all the time under
glitter so that one I'm going to keep my
favorite this one is usually in my purse
if you saw my what's in my purse it's in
there but were I took it out because I
was I paid in my niece's nails that with
this gold are so cute
this I just got I'm going to keep I love
the salon manicure line and I love my
toes are currently discolored temptation
these I just love these I really don't
think I'm gonna get rid of
because frankly the formula is might be
my favorite now orally also amazing
formula on one of my favorite shades
lollipop mm-hmm this julep polishes I'm
not in love with the julep formula I
really am NOT I might get rid of this
yellow one that I never wear that needs
to be shaken up and the white one I just
don't wear these I really wish I did but
the formulas it's just different I think
some people really love it but for me I
don't know it's really hard to work with
I might keep these glitters I don't know
I got to think I'm gonna think about all
of these julep polishes actually um okay
let's see
I love the Revlon line this is one of my
favorites this is a simple colors one
and I don't drink cheap wine and it's
like my favorite nail polish cover I've
got a bunch of OPI need to reorganize
these two um now onto my Essie boy howdy
do I have a lot of this stuff I love it
but I have a lot of similar colors and
so I need to really look through and
think and see okay like I already have
that color like these two are very very
similar a bikini so teeny and rock the
boat
I like bikini sorry I'm like off the
camera I like bikini so teeny better so
I might get rid of rock the boat I have
a lot of Pink's Cassady cool is one of
my favorites these are pretty similar
but they are a little different I don't
know I'm going to go I'm going to go
through these I think I'm going to get
rid of just this julep one in the shade
was it called Vivian because I have one
similar I have one similar to this this
is in strawberry cream and then these
three it's a mod square rock the boat
and ladylike
I have almost exact dupes for these in
the SE lines so I figure someone else
might enjoy those my brushes as well
these are all things I know I'm not
getting rid of that I use every single
day so um let's see most of these I
actually am really good about using I've
kind of whittled it down to the ones
that I genuinely really really love the
only thing this one this section here
are products that I don't use all the
time let me sit down so products I need
brushes so I might look through these a
little closer and decide you know I'm
just gonna pull these
lay them on my bed okay all right
these are like eyebrow razors I've never
ever used them and frankly I'm terrified
too so I might keep like one of them
just in case I ever actually want to but
I don't think so let's see all right so
we'll just start on one side this is my
Anasazi a little one I'm going to keep
this I'm going to keep in case I ever
actually because I've used it a few
times and it's one of those things that
like I'd probably get rid of it in a
week later but like dang it I wish I
still had it and I already own it so I'm
just going to keep it now moving on to
these things I think there's another
razor wand geez what is this oh this is
the one that came with the wet and wild
one interesting I actually really do
like all of these though and I use them
when I'm doing certain like types of
looks so I really don't know that
there's anything I'm gonna get rid of
might get rid of this I want this
eyeliner brush I don't know though cuz I
loved this for a long time because I
really I don't think I'm gonna get rid
of any of these I'm my mind is blown but
I use every single one of these for a
different purpose so I think I am going
to keep them all I am gonna get rid of
some of these eyebrow raise it'll down
my lipstick collection so this I know
these are the ones that I'm keeping
forever in my bathroom and I'm gonna go
through this little shelving unit and
decide what I want to get rid of oh my
goodness okay
I never use this I'm gonna get rid of it
this I just recently got from Big Lots
for two dollars in my favorite brand of
makeup wipes oh I think I'm going to
keep that because I know that I'll use
that I have my gosh I have so much like
random this is a dry shampoo I need to
just finish it's like half gone I should
probably move to my bedroom these are
all I use this too
oh my gosh I got this a long time ago
when someone was doing my hair for a
show and they it was the hairdresser
gave me the products and so this is one
of those but I do actually still use it
from time to time these this is comical
to even look through this I'm giving to
a friend I already told I was going to
give to her I have like 15 bottles of
natural
all like half empty I need to like
consolidate them or something let's see
oh this I'm going to get rid of this is
a Beyonce shower gel I used to have this
perfume a long time ago and I've never
used this so that's going to go to this
pile too all of those this I am going to
be using soon
I love Minnie Mouse so of course I'm
keeping that these natural glow bottles
I really do need to figure out something
to do with these because I don't want to
get rid of them because then it is nice
to have is a quick option just to have
some color if you ever need it other
than just you know fake tanning with a
glove things like that but like all of
these are really old so I think I'm just
going to get rid of those this one is
like never used I got on sale with a
bunch of them so like for sure I'm going
to keep that one and this one is was
bought at the same time and there's a
little bit so I think I'll keep that but
I think these older ones I'm just going
to toss their old who knows if they even
I'm just going to get rid of them now
this I just recently got so I'm going to
keep that my next lotion I'll be using
and soap I'll be using body scrub yes
these I use like when I'm outside I use
this you know what I mean and that
afterwards and then this it's almost
gone so I'm just going to keep and try
and finish up the next time I'm anywhere
where I would actually need that this
mouthwash now up here this I've been
meaning to try so I'm going to keep the
glam glow little thing obviously this is
another set of these so I'm going to put
that with that this is my just the Box
from my doctor sponge thing that was
sent to me that I love I think I'm going
to I guess I could just get rid of the
box recycle it this is another lotion
that I'm keeping to have as back of my
purse but I'm going to move it to my
room because that's usually where I keep
them this will be the next deep
conditioner mask thing that I use for my
hair I got on like clearance once and so
I'm saving I'm going to use that next
this is a face lotion I use from time to
time
I haven't been using it lately but
actually I might switch back to this
this is prescription uh-hum toothpaste
for my dentist
these I got at Big Lots for like a
dollar they're like the palm
one's ones or whatever you know what I
mean I've never tried them yet though so
I'm going to give those a try and then
these are razors that I bought on sale
that I just haven't used yet so
everything left in there are going to be
you is going to be used right let's see
put that back in there in my bathroom um
I feel like overwhelmed by this one this
is the lotion I'm currently using so
that one's almost done
think of my little snowman I'm going to
move this out of the way actually I'm
going to move with my candle here and
that out of the way too so this I'm
definitely keeping I've been using this
lately my josie maran argan oil and i
just love it tea tree oil I use beauty
blender cleansers almost gone but I use
I've been using this as well my josie
maran like a cleansing oil this I
actually might get rid of it has mineral
oil in it and I hadn't realized so that
one I think I'm just going to get rid of
this I just bought and I then I found
out I had mineral oil in it I don't know
why I didn't look so I might use it a
few more times just because I want to be
able to at least review for you guys so
I'm gonna hold on to it we'll see we'll
just see but this one I haven't been
using anyway and goodbye this is a
facial scrub I actually do use it's
about halfway gone so I drop our contact
solution that is more contact solution I
need to like get rid of one and well
this one's good for traveling obviously
this I use most times on my face it's
just Johnson well this is Sesame Street
brand just the hair and body baby wash I
use for my face actually
witch hazel toner I use this is another
backup lotion so I think I am going to
put this back here with that now I've
got two fantastic actually three the
Minnie Mouse one this I used for travel
this I use for self tanning
I actually really like it's a really
good inexpensive alternative to the
what's the really expensive one you know
what I'm talking about the really
expensive self-tanner this is a really
good alternative you know what you're
doing it works great so I keep that I'm
not using it now but in the summer I
might use it and then this I got it i he
I just hold cotton pads and I need to
refill
I've got q-tips
Shh this was like I used to all my
brushes in this but I've got apparently
two toothbrushes for myself I makeup
remover did I find out this one had
mineral oil in it too I think I did so
that I don't know and I haven't been
using it lately my toothpastes travel
one my like high fluoride one and then
regular this is a hair sample I might
just get rid of a hair tie this I use
baby shampoo for clean my brushes so so
far the only thing I'm like getting rid
of is this vitamin E oil right I think
that is it is that right I just pulled
this out from under my sink I've got a
new loofah which actually I need to
replace mine so I'm gonna go ahead and
put that in my shower all right I've got
actually these are like old contacts I'm
waiting on my new prescription but
there's still a little bit left in these
so I think I'm going to keep them in
case I really run out and I need at
least something I'll have something um
alright I don't even know where to begin
we'll just start somewhere
blowout cream okay I've used this twice
I might sell this this is almost gone
it's a hot spray I got like from Ulta so
I think I'm going to move it with my
hair stuff so I'll actually finish it up
and use it um I have a lot of travel so
if I need to like get all together you
know I have some more razors for I
apparently have a lot I don't you know
buy any of those any time soon I've got
travel shampoos conditioners more razors
oh my gosh oh my gosh
too much oh Pamprin I've been wondering
where that was need to check the
expiration date on that okay I need to
like go through this stuff and genuinely
get it all together so travel stuff is
all together etc these nail polish
remover pads I actually really like to
travel with and everything else I mean
look at this this is what happens yo
jeez this is a room spray I should pull
that out and actually use it I like that
so I reorganize all of my travel things
into this I have in this container here
the sets of shampoos and conditioners so
each one is in a set if it was outside
of a set
just put it over there I think I'm gonna
get rid of because I already have a lot
and if I only have one shampoo and no
conditioner I'm just like forget it you
know I just want to have sets so for one
vacation as you can just grab a set and
then I have like face products that are
travel size not that I'm just going to
travel with them I'll probably try them
at home but that's those here I have
what are these body washes and then like
shaving cream I have just empty travel
bottles here in the middle my travel
loofah travel size like hair oil
sunscreen etc travel sized lotions and
hair sprays and then I just got travel
sized mouthwash and some travel floss
and that is basically how that is
organized and these are all extra body
lotions I already have plenty these I'm
going to try and actually use up just
you know for everyday so I'm going to
keep these out near me up there so that
way I'll use these before I open another
like bigger bath and Bodyworks lotion
I'm going to use all these ups is
honestly kind of scary how much I'm
getting rid of and yet I still have so
much and I have to admit it's a really
good feeling because even though I still
have a ton I have to keep in mind that
yes I have a YouTube channel where I
review beauty products and hair products
etc so it makes sense that I do have a
lot and like I've said in past videos I
didn't buy all this a lot of it was sent
to me I don't make good money so I have
the money to buy all this but yeah so it
does feel good to declutter and just get
rid of stuff that you're never ever
reaching for no matter how hard it is
you usually you don't even remember it
two months from now you know that you
even had it so usually they're just
things you just won't miss
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
