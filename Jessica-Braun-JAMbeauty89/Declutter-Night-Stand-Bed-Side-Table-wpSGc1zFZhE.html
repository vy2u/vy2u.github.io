project over here because this is kind
of my area where I things go to die
you know and I mean so I've got it's my
nights and my bed unmarried right there
so I'm gonna organize this but I wanted
to show you the kind of before video of
everything so you can see how it changes
after I organize it so I've just got all
kinds of stuff I've got you know papers
a purse I'm not using shop lately boxes
labels for children's books because I am
preparing to be a teacher a journal and
old iPad case my laptop case umbrella I
mean just all kinds of stuff just like
you know actually organization boxes
some nail polishes go in this drawer
here hello bye oh boy well actually this
isn't too bad because a while ago I'd
worked on organizing it and then it just
fell to pieces again
I've got like vitamins some like makeup
an old iPhone case I mean stuff that I'm
just I mean it's just like tons of stuff
right samples I've got curling irons a
headbands actually there's a few
headbands over there my vitamin e cream
and then like a thing of thank-you cards
those bookmarks a bag back here so I'm
gonna find ways to use these different
organization things and maybe even bring
some other ones up here I just have the
my trap stick that I was using my
nighttime lotion my iPad because I
usually charge it here on my nightstand
the book I'm reading The Great Gatsby my
eye home my controllers and just some
candles in my water and uh laughs so
that's not too bad I mean that's just
stuff that I just need to pick up but um
so I'm gonna organize these things and
oh I guess I should show you in this
drawer I have like huh Oh old magazines
back when huh oh my gosh when I was a
julep maven I'm not any longer but I was
for a while that's so funny just
scrapbooks friends have made me journals
all kinds of journals and notebooks and
stuff I like to write down my thoughts
anyway so I'll be working on organizing
these and I'll see you guys in justice
oh I've cleared out all the drawers and
under there
ideally this is all I want on top of
this nightstand type of table just the
candles the my eye home where I charge
my phone at night of course my sleep
lotion and my lamp even the controllers
I'd like to have organized in a drawer
so I've taken out all the stuff I've got
it organized sort of I like what it is
like all the papers are together the
books the kind of electronic stuff so
I'm gonna go through all this stuff and
get it organized using a lot of these
different containers and maybe even
bringing in some others and then other
things just need to be hung up like my
purse needs to be hung up in my closet
just things like that so yeah I'll see
you again and I'm finally finished
organized actually the only things left
are these different things which I'm
gonna these are all samples and a lot of
them are like shampoos conditioners face
things and like you know white strips so
I think it makes more sense to have
these in the bathroom so I'm gonna move
those to the bathroom as well as a lot
of these these are a lot of like backups
of like travel-size things this this is
a L'Occitane hand cream that i love but
i only use it in the winter coz that's
when my hands are the driest so i kind
of put that away here in the summer
season so I think all of these things
are gonna get moved to the bathroom
somewhere these are all papers that need
to be recycled and otherwise everything
else was put in its proper place like
back in my closet or down and this thing
is where I keep a lot of my like phone
cases iPad cases things like that so a
lot of things went in there and
otherwise it's back in here so what I
did was I left like I said this
everything up there and then I kind of
cleaned out the drawers and what I did
was use this gray container that I got
for $1 at Target to house my three
different remotes my glasses and a pen I
figured might be nice to have a pen at
my bedside and then especially since I
have all these books that I end up
writing in and then I also have my just
an a USB cord for my phone which I tend
to grab for a lot but otherwise I just
charge it up there but that I need to uh
you know upload things to my computer
anyway so then I've got this little
container which I got like it was like a
gift thing from this past Christmas and
I'm just using it to organized got like
vitamins just things that I've already
like this i've talked about i depotted
so i have it in a smaller thing but
there's a lot left but it takes up so
much room on my vanity it's nice to just
kind of have it out of the way and then
this i use at night my vitamin e creams
so i like to have it near me and then i
have all my different diaries and
notebooks and things they're all kind of
specific to different things some of
them are a lot older but some i keep
like listen other ones i keep like
travel things in my boyfriend and i like
to write about traveling and just
different things like that and then here
are my little like thank-you cards and
things like that that i keep in this
really cute box and then this is
actually like medicines and things like
allergy medicines things that I might
need so I just keep them all together in
that little bag and that's all that's in
that drawer and so then down here I just
have I got rid of I'm gonna recycle the
older magazines that I had that we're
down in this drawer and I've got just
two newer magazines there for me to read
at night and then my book that I'm
reading in my iPad and of course my iPad
won't stay there all the time it's
usually with me but um it's nice to kind
of have a place and my chargers plugged
in over somewhere over here so it'll be
nice to have it right there I can just
charge it at night and then I have my
curling irons and in this little thing
this was a Victoria's Secret thing and
actually it's kind of silly
I took construction paper and taped it
on there so there was black because it
was see-through and I originally used to
keep nail polish in it and I didn't like
that you could see it I don't know I was
being really weird about it and so I
covered it but in it it's perfect -
how's my headbands and I really don't
have wear headbands very often so it's
nice to have this you know kind of
somewhere where I know to where I can
find it but not necessarily somewhere
where I need to reach for out of time
and odds are this is the curling wand
that I use all the time
odds are this won't stay in here long
it'll probably be near my vanity a lot
but the other two I don't use as often
they're less reach for so it's okay to
have them kind of out of the way so this
is the final look of my newly organized
little nightstand area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
