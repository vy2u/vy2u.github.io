sprays and primers I'm going to set them
all out so you guys can see them and
then we will go through the one okay
don't mind my PJ pants so I am going to
start over here this is brand new to me
this is from bosha
Basha bastia I'm just kidding this is
their - Bakke lotion glow ssin and
actually I had swatch this I think in my
was at my highlighters video cuz when I
got it in the mail they'd sent it to me
I just presumed it was like a liquid
highlighter but it's actually more like
kind of like the Mac strobe cream where
you can just use it as just a
moisturizer you could mix it with your
foundation it's just a very dewy lotion
and it actually really is pretty and it
kind of has a smell but it's a nice
smell it doesn't bother me and it just
feels really nice so I haven't used it
on my actual face but I am going to keep
it and actually use it so that is to
keep for me this is the hourglass veil
primer this is the only primer I have I
think that is like a silicon-based type
the rest are more like moisturizing just
because my skin is really dry and so for
me it really doesn't work to have those
like pore filling silicone based primers
for a long time I use them and I'm like
gosh why does my skin look crazy it's
because of that so but this one is
actually really really nice so I am
going to keep that one because I was so
impressed my skin looked flawless but I
don't use it everyday it's kind of more
of a special-occasion type thing just
because I don't I don't know I don't
like the way it feels on my skin at the
end of the day like I feel like my pores
have been clogged but it's a remake
syou're makeup look amazing that's what
I'll say this one I'm definitely getting
rid of this is the Sonia Kashuk primer
base it is
I think this broke me out it was either
this or the Sonia Kashuk foundation
which I'm also getting rid of in my
foundation declutter
it's just got like a pump the packaging
feels pretty cheap and dingy but it's
still kind of expensive and that's the
thing that kills me about Sonia Kashuk
is they're still kind of pricey but not
all of their products are great so and I
don't have anything against them I like
a lot of their lip products are amazing
some of their eyeshadows are incredible
but I feel like I recently bought a lot
of things from there and a lot of them
were no good so this one I'm definitely
getting rid of I'm glad to be rid of
this it just I'm pretty sure it broke me
out it didn't do anything for my face it
didn't really moisturize it didn't
really brighten it didn't really do
anything so goodbye this is the makeup
forever step one hydrating primer and I
hate how dirty this gets I need to clean
it grosses me out but I do like this I
don't think I would repurchase this but
I do want to use it up but it's just
kind of a lotion type primer I mean
literally
and it's not like glowy or anything it's
just like a classic lotion but it's nice
I think it does a good job of holding
moisture into my skin before I put
foundation or anything on which that's
exactly what I need so I like it this is
the master prime by face studio blur and
illuminate I love this primer it's just
again kind of a more lotion II and a
little bit glowy it kind of reminds me
of the Boscia Tsubaki lotion gosh like
in a lot of ways that could almost be a
dupe Wow so I really I mean I recommend
this if you've got dry skin and you want
a nice primer from the drugstore this is
probably my number one this is my number
one pick so I'm definitely gonna keep it
and I might I know I'm planning a dupes
video I'm gonna test these out and see
if they're dupes for each other because
this is much more expensive than the
maybelline one this is the Too Faced
hangover RX replenishing face primer I
love this again it smells like coconut
and it's one of those that it's just a
hydrating lotion type primer this is the
Mac strobe cream I love it I'm gonna
keep it this is the pixie glow ssin de
doo and it really could be a dupe for
the Mac strobe
preme let's let's try this out the max
show creams a little bit whiter I think
that's the Mac this is the pixie the
pixie has kind of like a oh my gosh no
when you see them in the light they
really they're doing like the exact same
thing
I wonder which is more expensive because
the Mac one when it's smaller like this
it's not too pricy at all
now the full-size is a little bit more
expensive but like this pixie this is
another one that could be like a dupe so
I will again and test these two out and
we'll see if it's gonna be in my
upcoming dupes video or not that is
awesome so far I am only getting rid of
one that's not great this is the Laura
Mercier foundation primer I actually
just got this in like a point perk from
I can't get it off in from Sephora never
have I use this it's do it's very
different than I expected it was a clear
one does it have a silicone feel it
feels kind of nice I am definitely gonna
try this out and see how I like it this
is kind of perfect cuz if I love it and
I get through a lot of these then this
might be one that I could buy like a
full size of so that is nice excited to
try that this is from Paula's Choice and
I've had it for too long it's not it's a
vitamin C spot treatment so it's not
really a prime or anything but it's to
lighten like brown spots on your face
but I've had it says six months and I've
had it for an embarrassingly long time
so it is time to get rid of it this is
the elf acne fighting gel and this is
awesome if this is salicylic acid I
think yes and it is awesome it's
literally just a rollerball from ELF and
I think it's like $1 and you can
literally just pinpoint any breakouts
you have on your face and just roll this
on top of it before bed or even in the
morning I've done it it's just amazing
to have on hand this is something I
typically travel with as well that way
if anything flares up I at least have
something to kind of work on it
overnight while I'm sleeping it's
amazing so I mean it's great if you if
your skin reacts well with salicylic
acid if it doesn't then it will do
nothing for you this
is the mac fix+ I have the one that I
have been using it's almost gone and
then the one I just bought to replace it
when I run out so I'm obviously keeping
both of those again these are amazing
for travel it's so much cheaper to buy
the smaller ones but really for me I
might as well buy the big one I've
mentioned this in the Mac haul I might
as well buy the bigger one but at the
same time I like to travel with this so
I figured for me I don't use it every
single day it's kind of perfect as this
small size alright so this is the
thermal a vane thermal spring water and
it's just like a spray water I bought
this I think when we were in Paris
because it's such a famous thing and you
literally just spray it on your face and
it's just supposed to be kind of
soothing and anti irritating I love the
idea of this but I never use it what I
might do is actually put it in like our
first-aid area that way if you know your
your face is burnt or anything like that
it can just feel really nice like a nice
cool spray just because I want us to get
use out of it but I'm not using it in my
daily routine the other thought is I'm I
could bring this with me to work to have
I need to replace what I've gotten my
makeup thing there I like to have like a
little bag of makeup at work so this
might be perfect to have there just to
kind of freshen my skin throughout the
day actually that might be how I bring
it so I think I'm gonna keep it but I'm
gonna bring it to work this I literally
just got in the mail it's by Laura
Geller and it's her spackle mist and I
think this is brand new it says hold
bottle away from face mist it lightly
you can apply it before makeup to prime
your skin after to set your look or any
time throughout the day to refresh it
makes me think of kind of like the
makeup primer spray by Scandinavia or
like the what's the one by Smashbox
their primer water is that what it's
called
I similar to that so I had literally
haven't tried this at all I do want to
try it so I'm gonna hold on to that this
is the pixie makeup fixing mist and I
don't know I feel like I have so many
sprays that I'm not used
I feel like I just don't need to keep
this so I think I'm gonna pass that on
these are this one's almost gone and so
is this one so I feel like I should just
keep them use them up and then I'll
probably repurchase one of them the
makeup finishing spray is the best I've
ever used I've done sponsored videos of
Scandinavia before this one's not
sponsored they don't even know I'm
talking about it I genuinely love this I
hope you would know that regardless but
I genuinely love this so much so I
probably will buy this again this is my
favorite at holding on to your makeup so
it doesn't move the primer spray is
really really good as well but this is
my absolute favorite so I didn't get rid
of much I have a feeling you know if I
don't like this I'll probably get rid of
it these will be gone soon this will be
gone soon this will be in my classroom
so a lot of these won't stay for a long
time so I don't feel too bad but again
it wasn't great but I know that one of
my sisters will probably love this this
I don't know that anyone would love to
be honest and this just needs to go in
the trash so this is everything I'm
keeping this is what I'm getting rid of
so be it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
