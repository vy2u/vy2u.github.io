I realized I needed to clean out my
purse and I figured I would take you
guys along so I dumped out everything
that was in my purse right here and I
want to just purge I've got so many lip
things and just so much crap in there
that I feel like I'm not using that that
she's taking up space in my purse for
really no reason and then I also feel
like there are a few things that I keep
wishing I had in my purse that I want to
put my purse so first we'll start with
getting rid of things I don't need so
bringing it in a little closer some of
the things like my wallet I pulled out
things that were just sticking out so I
want to like these are receipts I don't
need these are old or things I'm ever a
baseball ticket this is expired just
tons of things I literally don't need so
gonna throw these away that's a nice
chunk so now when I pulled them out
everything else is just like my normal
thing so that's a good feeling but I
have a feeling I'm going to find change
that I need to put back here either that
or I usually just put these in my piggy
banks so maybe I will but really feels
good cuz literally it was like this
that's what it was like seriously
jurassica get it together so buh-bye
loop's so I also just found coupons that
were expired that were like tucked in
there like I did keep some receipts
after going through them I did keep some
receipts that are things that I am
returning that are sitting in my car so
I need those and then I found some
coupons that were tucked in the other
side that I don't eat because they're
expired so that is again a good feeling
and now my wallets a little bit thinner
than it was before
alright my keys I need and by the way
just for fun Minnie Mouse bought in
Disney World one trip bought a pink
Mickey head another Disney World trip I
buy them each time I go and then now I'm
gonna have like way too many but I've
got like my PA box key and then my gym
card and all kinds of other cards and
then I've got my headphones on here but
I also have headphones here that I just
recently got as well and then I have my
really good ones that I showed in that
recent video the meze ones in my gym bag
so how many headphones do I need like
for real I do not need three pairs
headphones so I need to decide kind of
what I want to do with this I think what
I'm going to do is keep these like at
home near my bed and keep these on my
keys and then the other ones already in
my gym bag because I use those at the
gyms so that will so this will not be in
my first anymore bye bye so I know I
need my keys in my wallet I'm going to
set these over here to the side you guys
are gonna laugh sunglasses sunglasses
sunglasses why do I have three pairs of
sunglasses in my purse oh my gosh do but
these were from a scratch
box that I reviewed and I actually like
them because they're just so fun but I
might like keep these in my car these
are Kate Spade ones I recently got when
I got this for really cheap on HauteLook
I mean not super cheap but cheaper than
they would normally be and they're
really really cute and this is the Kate
Spade bag but I don't really want the
bag I mean it's fun but it's just not
really my style I guess so what I might
do is put the Kate Spade ones in here
and keep those in my bag and then put
these I don't really know maybe I'll put
these in my car why do I have so many
sunglasses either way these are not
going to be in my purse so I'm gonna go
and take those out and just keep the
Kate Spade ones in my really protective
case that I like Keith go okay
pepper-spray gonna keep my dad bought me
and he asked me if I have it with me all
the time so and I like having it's funny
when I lived in Chicago I had pepper
spray like in my hand at all times like
it was not even a joke but here it's a
little safer but maybe it's not I don't
know it's good to have alright pens I've
got three pens a Mickey Mouse one and
then some other ones this is one that I
use with my planner here but I might put
with all my other like pens that I use
for my planner I think I'm just gonna
keep my Mickey Mouse one because my mom
gave it to me and I love it and so how
many pet I don't need more than one
really and I'm not even in school
anymore so yeah so I'm going to keep the
one put the rest elsewhere I have my
nail fire fire sale fire I have my nail
file that I got from Sephora
the glass one that I love and these are
great because you can rinse them with
water and they're back to normal so
these are just fantastic and supposedly
it helps with your nails so they don't
peel as much which actually I have
noticed that my nails are not peeling as
much as they used to so definitely
keeping this in my purse I have gum I
actually only have one pack of gum in
here it's almost out but I'm going to
use it till it's gone but I always have
tons of backup packs of gum in my room
so when that's out I'll put any one in
but these are all keeps so far okay
where to go next
these are tampons I got this for like
two or three dollars at Walmart some one
of my subscribers was saying they use
their Apes e bags to hold feminine
products as well I thought duh that's
genius but I already have this so I'm
gonna go ahead and put that in there and
it is that time of the month so I do
need these with me but if it's not I
usually don't have them in there I might
keep one somewhere just you know
emergency but I also keep emergency ones
like in my gym bag which is always in my
car so that's another thing I don't
really have to but right now I need this
so definitely staying in there
okay here's change I can go ahead and
put in my wallet Yahoo I'm just nice to
have at least a little bit of change so
there's that alright um
so I'm lactose intolerant so I have like
dairy relief things these are allergy
medicines but I think my allergy season
has finally passed so these and these I
think can go yeah I'll just hold on to
them until next allergy season if
they'll still be good so I don't need
these in there I do need my lactase but
I need to find a little thing to hold
these in so I'm gonna put them to the
side but I want to find a place for him
allergy eyedrops my eyes are still itchy
even though the rest of my allergies
aren't as bad so I'm gonna keep these
for right now with me so look at all
these lip products are you guys kidding
me look at this huh what way too many
what this is insane
so Jessica stop letting this happen I
can't be do I know some girls are
watching this right now and you guys are
laughing because you know that if you
looked in your purse right now you'd
find like 10 lip products so I think a
lot of us are guilty of this that you
grab one to go with your outfit or just
because you want to use it that day and
you just leave in your purse this is
what happens so
this I just got an a what was it the
Ipsy bag right ladies yes so I want to
use this but I also love my little mini
buxom so I want to keep that in there
too but how many do I really need in
there right now this is a lipstick that
I got for free from Ipsy points it's a
full-size bareMinerals but I don't wear
it that often so I think I'm going to
keep it my lipstick collection for one I
want to actually wear it so I'm going to
take that one out this I was getting a
cold sore recently and this really helps
me kind of like as preventive care when
it's starting to pop up again but right
now I think I'm okay knock on wood so
I'm gonna go and take that out for now
um this is another this is the NYX sugar
pie I end up grabbing this almost every
single day I love this so much but these
are almost identical and I'm really
trying to try out the butter gloss
because I haven't used it so I'm
thinking I will leave the butter gloss
in the buxom and take this out for right
now the okay lip oh that's a lip balm -
so I'm getting kind of dirty isn't it
how much is left let me use some real
fast oh it is the best oh my gosh if you
haven't tried the EOS sweet mint oh my
gosh it's stupid good oh and on my
Instagram I recently like posted a face
of the day post like the products I was
wearing and I asked what you guys were
wearing on your lips and a lot of people
said the EOS sweet mint I'm like yes it
is so freaking good and it's I don't
like any of the other AOS ones this is
the only one I found that actually
moisturizes for me so I love it you
haven't tried it's awesome but I also
have another minty one the Nivea that
I'm wanting to try out because I really
haven't used it much but I'm thinking I
might keep this in my bag right now and
try and use No maybe I'll keep this on
my bedside clearly I've been decisive I
think I'll keep this at my bedside and
keep this in here the color which ones
this one color whisper in striker rose
one of my favorites but I haven't been
wearing it lately so I think I'm gonna
take it out for now this a sweet
subscriber sent me and I actually love
this she her what am I saying her shop
on Etsy is bombable the sweet orange oh
my gosh it smells amazing it's kind of
it's made from a lot of natural
ingredients but I found that it
moisturize my lips it didn't actually
make them chapped because I feel like
some chapstick really do do you guys
feel that way but
this one had really moisturizing
ingredients I love the sweet orange
smell the best she sent me another one I
don't member with the smell is but the
orange one's my favorite and they're
really inexpensive so if you're looking
for kind of a homemade fun little lip
balm for the summer I recommend it I
actually really like it so okay but I'm
going to hold on to that in my lip balm
area so when I'm getting ready in the
morning I can use that one okay so this
will be my purse lip balm I'll have two
options for lip glosses and love those
alright I feel better already that's not
too bad I should probably only have one
gloss but guys I just can't decide these
I just like these these are actually
like the dollar store brand of those
breath strips but they're just nice to
have on hand they work a live they're a
little stronger than like mints so I
just like having them so I'm going to
keep those tissues I should probably
just have but do I ever use them yeah I
really do keep contact a little case
keep yes this is to charge my phone and
I like having it but I need to have my
actual like wall charger with me as well
that way like sometimes I'll babysit and
I need it or you know there's always
something that pops up and I need the
actual thing for it so I need to go grab
one of my thanks for it hold on dang it
okay perfect so now we've got that I'm
going to go ahead and stick it in there
so I don't lose it in my bag that's
together I feel better already um so
this I've had since Christmas it's my
favorite scent and actually I've noticed
this the actual hand cream a subscriber
who actually came and saw me in a show
in December gave me this with a bunch of
other goodies and it was just so cool
she's the only subscriber I've like met
in person isn't that crazy other than
people I already knew so that is pretty
awesome
anyway she gave me this and it's one of
my favorites and I use it all the time
but I still have some left I can't
believe it I'm like scared to use it up
because it's limited edition so I need
to get the candles of these two anyway
that is besides the point the actual
like huge triple moisture body cream
which I also still have I've noticed
that one has a scent that's not as good
as the hand cream this one's a much
sweeter scent the other one the initial
scent is the same but like once it's on
your skin it kind of has an odd not bad
but it's different so I love
the hand cream oh my gosh I will
definitely be repurchasing it when it
comes back out this December it's so
good okay this a subscriber and friend
Ally sent me and I love the smell it's
French lavender and honey and it smells
amazing I love throwing themself on my
this self I love throwing this on midday
you know like after I've finished
running errands or whatever I'm doing
it's just such a nice fresh scent but
it's still sweet it's perfect so that
I'm definitely going to keep in there as
well now I have another scent in here
this is the Jasmine it's the brand
Demeter the roll-on perfume oil I use
this a lot in the spring but now that
summer I just haven't been grabbing
because I've been using this so I think
I might hold on to this and use it when
maybe next spring rolls around hand
sanitizers almost gone I might just
leave this on my vanity and get a fresh
one for my purse and just try and use
this up as my hand sanitizer on my
vanity so let me go go snag a new one I
picked the fresh picked blackberries for
my next one so who do I feel like it's
just such a summery sense so this is
ibuprofen
it's the Target brand and I use it so I
like having that on me so now that
leaves me with my old school iPhone 4s
which by the way I've been filming
videos for what like a little over a
year now the whole first like eight
months of filming I used my phone my
iPhone 4s I bought like a really cheap
$2.00 stand and that's how I did it and
if you guys would be interested I was
thinking about it if you'd be interested
in me making a video just on like how I
started my YouTube channel and maybe
like tips for people that are wanting to
or people that maybe already have just
kind of how I got the ball rolling I
would love to do that I'm certainly not
a pro and I certainly have room to grow
and and a lot of things to learn but I
am proud of the way I started it and um
so yeah if you'd be interested in that
let me know now I've got an empty makeup
bag what like why is it empty what did I
have in here I literally don't even
remember but this was if see the Ipsy
bag last month oh no I have another
scent this is that one I just got in the
hypsi bag as well that I really really
like
maybe I'll put this in my gym bag and
this in my purse
I think that's what I'm going to do
because I love this but I end up using
it after the gym anyway so maybe I'll
just put it in my gym bag instead also
if you'd like to see a gym bag
organization video let me know ok so
that leaves me with this empty bag which
I have no purpose for but maybe I'll use
it for some of these other things and
then I've got my planner of Doug that I
freaking love and then my iPad now I
don't always have my actually I don't
have my iPad with me most of the time
but it just happened to be in my purse
but I do usually have my planner so now
at least I have less stuff I'm going to
go through and see if I want to organize
this into other bags instead of having a
bunch of loose stuff and we'll just see
what I threw my make up and thought okay
what are products that because I really
don't carry make brown with me just like
lip stuff but sometimes I used to carry
makeup with me all the time but in
recent months I just hadn't been but I
realized there are some things I wish I
had to touch up sometimes so I went
through and I was like okay I want to
use my new bag from Ipsy the Rebecca
Minkoff ripsi bag that I love so that's
what I'm going to use but I went through
and I grabbed a brush this is the Real
Techniques duo fiber brush that's just
real small and really cute and I figure
I can use that this is my Yves pearl
classic trio and it's got all three of
these colors I thought that's perfect
cuz I've got anything I could want to
sculpt out my face or highlight my face
or just freshen up the blush I think
that's perfect now I'm not using it as
much as I wish in my regular collection
so this would be a great way to do that
in it has a nice mirror and I can just
use this brush and kind of clean it off
if I need to use different but I don't
want to bring a ton of brushes so this
is the Mac Studio Fix powder foundation
it comes with like a little sponge I can
use if I have to I don't find myself
needing it all the time but everyone's
all I do and so this will be perfect cuz
again I'm not using this as much as I
wish I would in my collection so those
are going in I also grabbed a just a
liquid liner because they're easier this
is just a Rimmel scandaleyes precision
one I've only used it a couple times and
nice swatch Jess it's not great it's not
the blackest it could be but it's not
terrible and I figure this is a great
way to to use this up liquid is just the
easiest way to touch-up for me if I'm
trying to blacken the line or winged it
out or you know like for
name time or something so perfect this
is a mascara I recently opened just the
Tarte lights camera lashes small one
it's not my favorite but it's okay so I
figured that'll be a perfect way to
again use it up when I'm wanting to
touch up my lashes or amp them up I
always wanting hairspray this is a
sebastian shape or zero gravity it's
about half gone because I use it when I
travel but I'm going to throw it in my
bag as well then the mac fix+ again I'm
not using as much in my collection but I
love it I just don't have a grab for it
when I'm first getting ready so I
figured this would be great to kind of
freshen up my face if I feel like it
just needs something more so I'm gonna
go ahead and keep that with me and then
also just some hair ties I wrapped
around a few bobby pins just because I
don't even have that how do I not have
that my bag oh no
so I fit all of that in there I'll just
have the hairspray separate now I also
have all these lip products I guess I
could put the lip ones in there but I
grab this little bag that I got an old
Navy it's like three or four dollars I
think but it's just cute it reminds me
of the long jump type of bags that feel
but they they're perfect for little lip
products aren't they which is why I was
thinking I might keep those in there
because I reach for lip products more
than I reach for anything and I didn't
want these to get lost in the bottom of
this bag so I think I am going to do
that but that still leaves me with like
my medicine and eye drops and my like
these things maybe I'll get another bag
are you kidding I'm going to have like
10 bags by the end of this I think I'm
going to put my perfume in with the lip
products because that's another thing
that I reach for more than anything so
there's that I also have my lactase I
need to put somewhere so why not use
that sunglass bag that was from what was
it Kate Spade or whatever for other
stuff because this stuff is all kind of
narrow and I figure it'll probably fit
fine so let's see that goes in that goes
in there probably that can go in and
maybe even these eye drops let's see if
they'll fit yeah they fit and it still
closes so that's perfect and then I can
just get in there grab what I need and
put it back in I love vertical storage
like that I know it's hard to see in
there it's kind of dark
but that actually is perfect and then
I'll just have maybe don't kind of stick
the lactase in there do I think that's
going to work actually it totally does
work that is exactly what I'm going to
do perfect okay so now I've got
everything that I want and I don't think
I need to put anything in like a
separate bag so let's go ahead and stuff
these into my bag shall we so this bag I
got at I think Burlington Coat Factory
the brand is I have no idea it literally
doesn't say anywhere so it's not like a
crazy well-known design or anything like
that but is it not adorable I love it
so it's got this back pocket this is
where I like to keep my phone so I'm
gonna go ahead and put my phone there I
don't like to keep a since you can tell
that I have nakey phone I used to use
cases and I had a million and everybody
was like you know what I feel like I'm
never getting you to appreciate the
slimness of the phone and while my phone
is no longer perfect every time I've
ever had a case on it I've used OtterBox
I've used like the thick nut case mate
but the other brand spec cases I've
dropped it in my phone has cracked with
those cases on it so I'm like whatever
they don't the OtterBox it cracked the
my screen cracked with the speck case
and so I'm like why even have a case
it's making it so bulky and frankly I
was just getting tired of them almost
like I am just gonna appreciate my phone
for the way it is it's pretty darn
durable now of course yes I'm more
likely to crack my screen but I just
kind of like having it naked if I might
be the only person in the universe but
hey anyway so I'm just gonna keep my
phone in there and that's it I don't
think I want anything else in there just
leaving it alone I like to use this part
right here just for my keys because my
keys are so stupid thick and heavy and
I've got a lot of junk on them I just
like to have them alone plus I know I
can reach in there and always find my
keys so that is one thing that I've kind
of learned over the years with my bags
that it drives me nuts to not be able to
find my keys so the rest of the bag has
this middle compartment with the zipper
and then two parts on the other each
side and then these areas here so I
figure I'll use these areas for things
that are kind of loose that I might
reach for a lot for example the medicine
the ibuprofen I might stick in here
and I also might stick in here like the
gum and this stuff because I reach that
all the time
what else maybe the pepper spray because
I want it to be like readily available
let me make sure it's locked that always
makes me right yeah it's locked
makes me nervous okay so those are
things I can reach for pepper spray I
want to be able to grab quickly if I
need so that's good now what about this
middle compartment I'm kind of thinking
what I'll do I have here I need to like
move these this my phone charger that is
I think I'll put in the middle
compartment because if it's out and
about it's like takes up a ton of room
but if it's kind of in this zippered
area I think it'll be more controlled so
I'm going to stick that in there I think
I'm going to put my tissues in there as
well what else maybe you know what I'm
going to put my pen and nail file in
with the gum because they're all kind of
sticking out and again I can reach for
those easily there I'm going to put my
contacts case in here as well because
again I don't reach for it all the time
and I think I'll even put the little
tampon case in there as well just to get
all of those little things kind of
tucked away and I can zip on but I know
where to find them and they're not
getting lost in the bottom of my bag so
that leaves me with my bags basically
all my different bags my sunglasses and
then my planner and iPad which really is
usually just planner so I've got the two
different sides I think I'll put the two
kind of hefty things in actually I might
put them in this side because I hold
this end against my body and I don't
want these flat things right against my
body I'd rather have like pushing things
that make no sense so now I'm just going
to kind of do vertical storage on this
so I'll have my makeup my other thing
this is getting pretty hefty here I'm
going to have my sunglasses there my
wallet here
and then my lip things I guess I'll just
kind of tuck in there as well perfect
I feel so much better and now
everything's got kind of a home so when
I take it out I've got to put it right
in the same spot I love using this this
way so I can just easily grab the hand
sanitizer and then stick it back easily
grab the hairspray whatever I know I can
just pull this out if I need to redo any
of my makeup and then this is just my
little lip heaven and if I get too many
lip products in here and I can't fit
them back in here I know I need to clean
out my lip stuff from my purse so
that'll be helpful for me to kind of
gauge and make sure that I don't have
too many lip products in my purse so I
also like to wipe down my purse from
time to time with like a Lysol white to
kind of kill germs just clean it because
if you think about where like your purse
and especially the bottom of your purse
has been it's pretty gross I mean and I
try to be very conscious of that you
know never setting it down on a bathroom
floor or anything like that or in public
on the floor but sometimes you know
you're in a predicament where you pretty
much have to so I like to just clean it
from time to time and actually I've
recently I actually recently wiped it
down I wipe it down actually a lot
because it really grosses me out
but regardless that's just one more
helpful hint
just keep prolong the life of your bag
and also keep it clean oh let me make
sure I can zip it up oh yeah
all done so this is the pile of things
that I took out of my purse that were
just taking up a ton of space I mean
that's a lot of stuff that's a
significant amount of stuff that was
just sitting in there you know all those
receipts are trash these are going to go
back into my collection this is just
going to go elsewhere sunglasses will go
elsewhere and these will probably go in
my gym bag so you know it's just really
helpful to see how much I mean that's a
lot of space that I was lugging around a
lot of weight for really no reason so I
just feel so much better I am very happy
with the way this is I have a lot in my
purse but I don't know I like having
what I need with me and you know it
could be worse I could have a lot more
in here but I'm happy with what I have
