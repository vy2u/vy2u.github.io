box from Target and it was like $24.99
and it was like really recent like two
or three weeks ago and you it was in the
background of my videos for a bit and
now I moved it over here and now I've
been displaying my perfumes on top of it
but I've been putting my jewelry in it
but when I got it I really didn't
organize I kind of just threw things in
it first I figure I would declutter my
jewelry collection I'm clearly on a
decluttering kick and I kind of started
looking at my jewelry especially my
necklaces and realized oh my gosh I have
way too much and I've actually gotten
rid of a lot but I still have more than
what I'm using and I pieces that are
just kind of getting older they're worn
out so I figured I would take you along
with me as usual so I've kind of set out
a lot of my jewelry here and I even have
this earring tree here that I'm going to
go through as well so as you can see
right now all I'm doing I have like all
my dainty necklaces all kind of hung
together here and then I have other ones
that were given to me by my mom or just
random ones hung on the back but they
still get tangled it's not like that's
even great it's not even a good storage
idea to be honest I just it it works
okay if I have like maybe two but any
more than that they you know it makes a
little more difficult and then I just
have all my dangly jewelry here so I'm
going to go through this and I think I
am going to take everything out like I
said and say it it out just so I can
really start fresh and put it back up
there the way I want okay so now I have
got every single piece of jewelry that I
own laid out here I took all of my
earrings off of the tree and also the
dainty necklaces that I had hanging I
laid out there so these are all of the
dangly earrings those are all the dainty
necklaces those are all of my either
anklets or bracelets and watches and
then these are all of my bigger chunky
necklaces right here I figure we can
start here so I want to see what I want
to get rid of and what I
keep here this is a twisted silver
bracelet that I love and I love that you
know I think I hook it on this one and I
kind of love that there's a little extra
dangly piece so this one I'm definitely
keeping these are the only two watches I
used to have like eight watches and I
realized I can only wear one watch at a
time and really all I ever really wanted
is silver one that has silver pieces and
one that has a gold that way it kind of
matches any outfit I could possibly have
because I had a bunch of colored once
and at the time I loved him and I warm
but I get I guess I've kind of grown out
of it I don't know so these are perfect
for me they're both this one was more
expensive but I got it on HauteLook for
a good deal it's Bergy brand I'm sure
I've said that completely wrong and then
this is just a Geneva one I got online
for like 10 bucks so Geneva is a is a
really inexpensive watch brain you can
get every color Under the Sun on Amazon
and eBay and everywhere else I think
even Kol sells it but I just like it
because I can replace it whenever I want
if I get tired of this style and it's
pretty inexpensive but it works really
well so I'm definitely keeping both of
those and that is all I have watch wise
and I'm very happy about that now this
is a piece I got from shop lately I'm
gonna try and tell you where I got each
piece of jewelry that I'm keeping
because I you know I hate watching
videos and I'm like ah that's really
cute and they never mentioned where his
from so I'm gonna try and be good about
that this was from shop lately I really
like it and it's actually really hefty
but the only thing is even on the
tightest like setting it's a little big
on me I've literally worn it once so I
might sell this I think any pieces that
are really nice that I've never worn or
are basically brand new I might sell but
I love this but it's just a little too
big oh it's so cute though so that is
gonna go in my it's really nice I'm
gonna sell it pile let's see this my
mommy and my daddy got me for graduation
and it's just this really beautiful
sterling silver bracelet that I love
it's got a cross on it because I am
religious so that is a treasure and
definitely keeping and I just recently
got it so that is a key for sure this I
just gotten my wantable
accessories box and I am obsessed with
it it's that bracelet that I showed that
is what wins around three times and it
actually like fits small wrists it is
amazing that I wear it almost every day
it's kind of a joke okay what else what
else
so bracelet wise this bracelet I really
like I got from shop lately but I just
don't wear it I love that it's really
dainty but if I'm not wearing it there's
no point in keeping it so this will go
in this cell pile I love this my
boyfriend's mom got this for me and I
think she said Amish country and I just
think it's so pretty I wear it all the
time I like to stack it with other
bracelets so definitely used to have a
charm that hung from it just a little
one that was so cute but it fell off and
I don't know where it is so but the
bracelet itself is so gorgeous so this
is definitely a keep in fact look how
cute those would be together oh love it
keep you keep this one I really do like
this one yeah I got to keep that that is
stupid cute right and it actually fits
my wrist I think this one was from shop
lately as well you're gonna get annoyed
I know but shop lately is the bomb and
it's really cheap so win-win so
definitely keeping that this and this
were in a set this is a necklace we're
in a set from again my boyfriend's mom
she got it for me for graduation and I
love it
again it's one that I'll cherish and
it's really I like it because I like
pearls but I like that it had just
something different like the little
black beads I just think that makes it
just that little bit more different and
I really like this so no the necklace
I'm keeping and obviously the bracelet
I'm keeping as well this was a like
charity thing that again you're gonna
laugh my boyfriend's mom gave me I can't
remember what the charity was if I can
figure I might ask her what it was I'll
link it below but basically when you
donate money I think you get this
bracelet and I just thought it was fun
looks like Little Nemo in there it's
just it's just cute and it you know it
can kind of match and stack with
anything so definitely keeping that
these are batteries for my watches I'm
not sure I'm not even sure though what
it goes with but I think this one goes
with that one so I'm gonna keep them
just so it's one less thing but I think
I'm going to put them in like my sewing
kit instead of in my jewelry box this
was in my best friend Emily's wedding it
was part of our little like it went with
our sash that we wore with our dress so
this is a treasure that I will keep but
think since it's not really what I'm
gonna wear I might put it in my little
like box of memories because this isn't
something I'm gonna wear again I'm just
gonna keep it for the memory so that I'm
gonna keep but I'm not gonna put it in
my jewelry box so those are actually all
of my bracelets I think I did pretty
good that's not an overwhelming amount
for me because I don't do well with that
I've got a good mix of gold and silver
and beads and pearls so perfect very
happy with what I got left these are
both anklets and I just don't wear them
I think these will go in the sell pile
because there's the I've never worn
either one of these this one's from
premier jewelry and this one's from shop
lately and I never ever wear them I
think literally they're both brand new
so those are gonna go in myself so I
know that I'm keeping this necklace in
fact I need to take the price tag off so
I can wear it these are all my dainty
necklaces let's see well this is some of
them this I just recently got so I don't
I love it it's just the you know a
simple sideways gold cross necklace but
I love it I wear it all the time this is
a one I got from dog-eared that I bought
on HauteLook for you know like 50% off
or something and I just love it's got
like a little locket and I love it so
those are kind of my two favorite gold
dainty necklaces I see another gold
dainty necklace that is tarnished and
ready for the trash it's I don't even
remember where I got it but it's this
little like rose gold heart and it's
cute but it's totally tarnished so
that's a trash one goodbye feeling
better already
okay these are three different silver
ones I've got a wishbone one here and I
actually have earrings that match that I
have this figure 8 infinity sign which I
love it reminds me of so many things I
love the infinity sign because it makes
me think of Jesus and how he is eternal
and that you know that's my belief but
it also makes me think of just how you
know what you do comes back to you so
it's it's a really nice reminder for
many different things for me so that I
love and I'm gonna keep and that was
from shop lately and then this J
necklace I just love because it's my
initial I just I just like it actually I
think that's my favorite silver necklace
the one I don't wear as much as the
wishbone necklace I think I might sell
that as well it's literally every worn
it like once but it's a little bit
longer than these
and I just don't find myself ever
reaching for it so why keep it if I'm
never wearing it might as well pass it
on while it's still new and really nice
so I'm gonna sell that one okay so now
I've got this J medallion one that I got
on show up shop lately as well and I
think I'll keep it for now I haven't
worn it as much as I think I should but
I have one that a few times I've really
liked it
so I want to keep it and try and pair it
with some outfits and get some use out
of it before it eventually tarnishes I
am sure these are two different gold
chains my mom gave me and they're real
and I never I don't know I or at least
they're partially real I don't really
know but she's had them for years and
years and years and so she gave them to
me and I don't really wear them but I
don't want to get rid of them so I'm
gonna find a place for these that's kind
of maybe like in a air proof bag and
just put them away safe because I don't
wear them but I don't want to get rid of
them because they're special you know
this is another necklace that my mom got
me and it's starting to kind of tarnish
but it says daughter so I think I'm
gonna again put it away somewhere in an
airtight bag in my like special box so
now I figure we'll move on to like my
bigger necklaces like statement
necklaces and just just bigger ones that
aren't quite as dainty this is one I got
from chop lately that I love I wear all
the time I can't believe it hasn't
harnessed yet it's been like I feel like
a year and a half but I love it so that
is a definite keep this one I just I
don't really wear all that often again I
got it on top lately but I just don't
wear it so I think this might be a sell
one okay this one my mother gave me and
it is I think it was my grandmother's so
that is an obvious keep this one I just
got from wanna Bowl and I loved it so
much I really do and so I'm excited to
pair this with something I'm excited
because I really don't have any
necklaces like this because I haven't
been big on the huge statement necklace
um
trend cuz some I don't know they kind of
get in the way but I figure this is a
good one and it's kind of more muted
which I really like this is a rosary
that my parents gave me again I'm going
to key
but I think maybe I don't need to keep
it with my jewelry I think I should keep
it with my special thing so that's what
I'm gonna do with that and maybe I'll do
the same with this one my grandmother's
pearls maybe I'll keep this in my like
keepsakes moving along this is one of my
favorite necklaces from Twisted silver
that I love and I wear all the time so
that's a keep this one I don't really
wear all that often I think my sister
gave it to me a while ago but I just
don't really wear it so I think I might
sell that one as well I think I've
literally never worn it okay this one my
boyfriend got me I want to say a year
and a half ago and I don't know I'm just
I don't wear it all that often I do like
it though maybe I'll hold onto it for a
while because I've worn it I used to
wear it a lot and then I just kind of
stopped I don't know so this is one I
got from shop lately as well and it's
just this really cute pearl one but I've
like worn it once and I just don't wear
it I mean it's terrible but it's true I
just don't wear it so I think this will
also be a sell one this one I haven't
had the chance to wear it's another
twisted silver one it's really cute but
it's one of those that's really long and
I just don't find myself wearing it I
think I might get rid of this too this
one my mom got me when she was on a
cruise and I don't remember which
country it was from but it's made from
like watermelon seeds and things like
that so I might keep it in my keepsake
box but I never wear it so this is one
of my all-time favorites I actually got
it at Kohl's it was I think it was the V
R Bradley yeah brand but it is just I
just love it I love that it's different
tones and I wear it all the time it's
one of my favorites same goes for this
one this one I got in a wantable box and
I love it I have so much okay let's see
here this one I think I've outgrown and
by outgrow and I mean I wore it a couple
times and I just every time I try it on
with an outfit now it never looks right
on me it's cute but it just never looks
right on me so I think this is another
sell when this was from premiere it's
really expensive but I just don't wear
it this one I don't even remember where
I got this so I think I'm just gonna
get rid of that one I don't ever wear it
this one I got from premier jewelry and
I actually really do like it I don't
wear it as often as I think I should but
it's I love it and I don't have anything
like it so when I have outfits to wear
with it I love it so and this is a
keeper for sure it's also from shop
lately it might be my favorite piece
I've ever bought from shop lately it is
so cute click lava rocks so that is a
definite keeper so I think I have done a
pretty good job with getting rid of
necklaces i whittled it down quite a bit
and now this is all I'm keeping not too
bad
so moving back to my earrings that I've
wore the dangly ones that I had back on
my holder this holder by the way I got
it Big Lots I think like my mom got it
for me quite a long time ago I've had it
for a long time but they sell things
like this all over the place I can look
on online and maybe throw some links
below but I know Amazon if you type in
like earring tree you can get way cuter
once than this this one's kind of plain
which now I don't mind it used to have
like more but the wire flower thing at
the top I can kind of show you the wire
flower thing at the top kind of like
fell apart so it kind of came off it's a
mess but I like how simple it is and I
like it's black and so it's not adding
even more kind of gaudiness to all of
the earrings I usually have on it so I
do like that but it's not sold at Big
Lots anymore so so onto the earrings
I've gone through that I go through
these quite a lot but I have realized
there are some that I'm never wearing
these see I'm torn because these are so
cute but I since I have dark hair they
really don't stand out much and so I
just never wear them so I'm gonna sell
them ok
these those I wear sometimes this is so
hard okay these I know that I never wear
there's nothing wrong with them I wore
them like once I don't even know if I
warm once they're cute I think I got
them at Target but I just don't ever
reach for him these are from a sweet
subscriber and I think I might not hang
them up on here because they get lost I
might put them elsewhere in a jewelry
box that way I can find them okay
hmm I'm debating on these they're really
cute they're premiere and they're just
little pink things but again I just
don't find myself reaching for these
very often if ever I need to wear these
these I don't find myself wearing often
so I might get rid of these I think I've
worn them maybe once they're cute but I
and I got them at Kohl's but I just
don't wear them looking at the rest of
these I really do wear these I wear the
feathers these are from Target I wear
these these have only worn like once
they were sent to me from I don't
remember what the company was but they
sent me a bunch of crazy ones and these
are the only ones I ended up keeping at
the end just cuz the other ones really
weren't in my style this one's kind of
still crazy but it's kind of fun so and
it's nice to have at least a few options
of just like crazy funky things so I
think I'm still going to keep those
because I they're just fun the rest of
these I wear all of those I wear those I
definitely wear these I wear those wear
those these are a nice dressy option
they're just like really simple you know
straight things you know straight things
but I like having them when I am
dressing up it's a nice option where
these these are just my classic silver
Nine West hoops that I wear all the time
these I also like they're like crosses
cross hoops so I think out of those I'm
happy with what I've gotten rid of there
so I'm kind of realizing that these
little like leaves they stick out are
kind they get in the way cuz they'll
like some of them are like sticking here
and then when I'm putting earrings in
that's kind of in the way and I'm like
you know what these are really malleable
or pliable whatever the word is so I'm
just gonna tuck them in so then they're
all just kind of kind of following the
vine up because they were really getting
in the way and now I have all this free
space there for my earrings so I've kind
of organized my earrings before hanging
them up over here like my kind of like
thicker dangly ones then I've got these
they're kind of in a class of their own
like medallion once then I have my like
skinny dangly ones this is ridiculous
then I have my hoops and then I've got
like medium dangly one it's ridiculous
isn't it but I think is going to kind of
help when I'm organizing them onto the
tree so I'm proud to say that all of
this is too
that I am getting rid of or selling and
this is all stuff that's gonna go in my
keepsake box put away because it's not
stuff that I necessarily wear but I want
to keep it because it all has like
special meaning so if you are interested
to see how I actually ended up
organizing all the jewelry that I ended
up keeping I will be uploading my
jewelry collection video once I've
organized it all here in a day or two so
once I've had it uploaded I'll
definitely link it below so that you can
find that
