going to be doing a different kind of
video I've done products I regret buying
videos in the past and I'll link all the
ones I've done I've actually done some
recently like high-end products that I
just didn't like this video is gonna be
focused on products that I was sent for
free from companies that I didn't like
guys it's just makeup I'm wanting to be
honest with you guys as I always have my
job is to tell you guys what's good
what's not what's kind of mediocre and
so that's what I'm doing here so I know
that for some people these are products
you like you'll be offended or if you
just think that I'm ungrateful but I
hope you can understand where I'm coming
from that I'm just doing my job to tell
you guys what products I think are worth
finally what products aren't and a lot
of these are really really expensive
products that I don't want you guys to
waste your money on so again take what
I'm saying with the grain of salt
because I am just one person and it's
just my opinion my skin type my skin
coloring all of that plays a part so Wow
without further ado let's go ahead and
get into it so the first one I wanted to
mention was sent to me by pure cosmetics
or pure they I know they're going
through like a rebranding kind of thing
they have a lot of great products that
they have sent me that I really liked
including their pure eye gloss that you
like it's like the sponge and it's
amazing I've done a video I'll link it
below this is their pure cameo contour
and they sent me all of them this one's
in the shade light it's the only one I
kept because it would be it would fit my
coloring it's dual ended so you get a
stick of the contour shade on one side
it's pretty pigmented right I mean and
it's actually a pretty good color and
then you get the highlight shade on the
other it's kind of more of like a
foundation shade if you will pigmented
as well um you guys honestly it wore off
in the most patchy way ever that I
couldn't believe it I've tried so many
different like cream contours and
usually at least if it's going to wear
off it'll just wear off in one piece the
day I wore this
didn't count for like my whole face or
anything I was just contouring right
here and I just highlighted like you
know a few areas but mostly I was
looking at the contour because the
highlight I was like well you know we'll
see but it's kind of more like a
concealer anyway so I was really focused
on the contour side and it looked crazy
by the end of the day like it was just
like splotchy it looked like someone had
taken a sponge and just stipple it on it
looked weird like it looks scaly like a
lizard and so I was like okay maybe it
was just the foundation and the
primaries using I've tried it like two
more days like I'm there I wasn't
working at that time cuz I just felt
crazy at the end of the day I was like
this is embarrassing so I wore it with
different primers different foundations
and it still wore away that same way and
I was like okay I can't I just can't
so this is one that because of the way
it stays or doesn't stay on I can't
recommend it to anyone now I didn't try
all the other shades because again it
wouldn't fit so I know for sure that
happened with the light I just I don't
have oily skin
I've got really normal to dry and
especially in here I never really have
experienced that with anything else so I
have to attribute it to this product the
next one is one of my favorite brands
elf eyes lips face you guys know I love
them but I also will tell you in
products are terrible I recently
mentioned this in my January favorites
and flops as a flop but these are the
elf I already forgot what they're called
again I'll list it on the screen same
thing happen to the other video these
are really really inexpensive but
they're horrible when you put them on
your lips they swatch nicely on your
hand but when you put them on your lips
they pull your lips and they just look
crazy and then like they'll catch any
dryness you have on your lips it will
catch it and on top of that it wears off
horribly your lips feel even drier
afterwards and they sent me all the
shades that I tried I think all of them
on my lips horrible there are tons of
tinted lip balm options out there these
are ones you should stay far far away oh
this is going to be one that is shocking
to many these are the YSL rouge
pur Couture lipsticks in number 19 and 9
these just happen to be the two shades
sent to me these oh my gosh I had tried
them in so many ways and there's
something when you swatch them they're
beautiful they're really I mean crazy
pigmented but no matter what lip liner I
have worn them with and without lip
liner of course they look crazy on the
outer parts of my lips like they just
wear away again kind of in a splotchy
weird way and I'm so sad and I want
these to work and these colors I mean
especially that color is absolutely
gorgeous
but every time I've worn these I felt
like no like I just don't like them so
for that reason I can't recommend them
and I mean the Revlon Super Lustrous
lipsticks are so much better and they're
like six dollars so there are so many
options that I would recommend over this
for way cheaper that I just can't I
can't with these if you're gonna buy a
YSL lip product I would say tries to try
the Rouge Velux they're really really
silky they're really pigmented as well
but they're just comfortable and they
they're kind of gliding in a way but
they don't go outside your lip line it's
really weird to be honest but I like
these so much more and this is one of
those things that I have to just say I
can't keep them just because the
packaging is beautiful because if I'm
not using them pass them on Jessica and
I you know I'm the queen of decluttering
i declutter all the time I've done tons
of videos on it and that is my biggest
thing not holding on to products that
are just cute or you know that were
maybe really expensive but if I'm not
using them ever and they're bringing me
no joy even looking at them I just feel
guilty that I don't use them then why am
i keeping you know the next one I'm
gonna mention I'm really sad about this
is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation I wore for my wedding the
Makeup Forever HD foundation and I loved
it they'd be formulated it in the new
formula on my skin which is like normal
kind of dry this time of year is
horrible it I don't know what they did
but I'm so sad I'm like no and I've even
compared it literally side by side on my
face and it is completely different this
formula for some reason just sits on top
of my skin I've done it with brushes
I've done
my hands I've done it with the
Beautyblender no matter how I apply it
it just moves around on top of my skin
you can just see you can just see it
sitting there and it's the weirdest
thing because the original formula
blended so seamlessly into my skin and
it wasn't my number one favorite
foundation of all time but it's
certainly up there and this one it just
doesn't cut it I don't know and I wonder
if it works better for like maybe oily
skin types that sinks and I don't see
how it would I don't know a lot of
people love it in formula I was not
impressed and you know I kept trying it
thinking oh my gosh there's no way this
is as bad as it's looking maybe I'm
doing something wrong but no matter what
I did it looked crazy and these were
sent to me by make up forever so you
know I hate to say that but I did not
like it this next one was sent to me by
hourglass and I was like wow like this
is so exciting and you can understand
that okay what is going on so this next
one was sent to me by our glass and you
can understand like it's still emotional
for me to get packages from these
companies that are amazing companies
that I'd like how do they even have a
clue who I am let alone send me things
so it's not that I'm ungrateful I just
want to be real with you guys and let
you know this is their immaculate liquid
powder foundation this would maybe be ok
if you have oily skin because it is very
drying and what when I first tried this
out I didn't really have any dry skin
and it just looked so splotchy and
patchy right off the bat I couldn't I've
never had that experience and no matter
how I applied it it would just it was
orange and it would just those orange
spots would oxidize on any dry patch on
my face and never go away no matter what
I did unless I was just taking all of my
makeup off this was like oh this was
horrible I and I kept looking at it
thinking how was this possible and this
is the shade ivory and it was completely
orange I wonder how it will show up oh
okay
can you guys see of course the lighting
is not doing it justice at all it looked
crazy on my skin absolutely crazy but
not only was the color just wrong and
that happened so you know that would be
a shade by shape thing I would assume
but that beside the fact that it just
caught every dry patch and I could not
get it to go away no matter what I was
just astounded I was like okay so not
for normal to dry skin again if you've
got oily skin let all of us know down
below if it works for you but this is
really expensive to have this experience
so I'm really glad to share with you
guys don't buy it if you have normal to
dry skin another product that was
recently said to me was from sleek and I
just recently actually got this and
hauled this in a sleek like makeup haul
this is their bare kissed illuminator
and when i swatched on there i was like
oh my gosh cuz it's this is crazy it
it's beautiful I mean when you look at
it it's like wow that's so pearlescent
but guys that's gray like that is silver
there's no it is silver now you can put
this on your eyelid and it probably look
beautiful you know just kind of I don't
know it's actually gray and I remember I
applied it with the stippling brush like
I had it like this on my hand I stippled
some onto it and it looked crazy I'm
like okay so now I know not to be that
so that I mixed some with like a tiny
bit with foundation I looked like The
Tin Man I was like oh my gosh this is
crazy so I don't know what I am pretty
fair if it doesn't work on me it can't
work very well on deeper skin tones and
again there are gonna be exceptions to
that rule but no just no no no no no no
no no so those are the grouping of
products that I've recently been sent
that I was just about just not impressed
at all hopefully I explained it well so
it made sense as to why it didn't work
for me and my skin tone on my skin type
I hope that you will check out some of
my other videos and subscribe so you
don't miss any other ones and I'll see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
