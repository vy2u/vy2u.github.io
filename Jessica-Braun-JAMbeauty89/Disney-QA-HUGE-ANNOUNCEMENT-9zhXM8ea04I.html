heated some polly and we are here to
bring you a disney Q&amp;amp;A we've had a lot
of people on both of our channels ask
for more Disney and I know some of you
guys well the people that aren't big
Disney will probably are not watching
this river so that's right so all of you
guys that are watching a lot of you guys
have asked about how to plan a Disney
trip and how to you know what are the
places you should eat at and what snacks
should you get in what else should you
stay out how many days should you go so
we felt like we should probably
chocolate and I should probably say that
we also have a very large announcement
to make
but we will be making that announcement
just to be evil I laughing cause I feel
like I do this my students all the time
I'm like but I don't tell you about that
tomorrow after you yeah that surprise
will be unveiled on his channel so this
will be kind of the first set of
questions that I had on my Instagram
two-parter yeah it's a tour Carter Japan
you say it better and then the second
part of just some more questions will be
on his channel and we will also unveil
the surprise on his self the link firt
Shh that's enough
quiet iPad so the link for his video
will be below and also right up there
right now go ahead and check it out I
know so it's like the Brady Bunch when
they're looking at like what's the Brady
Bunch song where they're like well
they're all looking at each other yeah
in the boxes here's a story of a lovely
lady funny I love it so on my Instagram
let me refresh because we've got lots I
posted this pic can you see it it's not
a great pic but you know can't see um
yeah it's me right now a live fan um I
just asked what are your Walt Disney Row
questions so let's see so AG cage on
Instagram asks us what is your favorite
Epcot pavilion that's tough
they're all so good they're all so did
they are honestly though I gotta be real
I think it's Mexico for me because like
that was like the first one I ever went
into and it's still like the first one
we usually go to do we
go into the left yeah who knows why but
never never started in Canada and I
don't know why it's just yeah we really
don't and like the margaritas they're
amazing if you're of age and I'm not
there when he finally ate it son on hell
in inside which was so cool and what I
love Donald Duck and he's in the little
boat ride they have in there and the
shops are so cute and now like a
personal thing and one of my students
went there this past spring break and we
got to see her there too with her family
which was so cool and it was in the
Mexican veins it's like even more
special what about you I think my
favorite is probably the Morocco
pavilion
I love Morocco I mean when you go in
like a like this last time we were just
there I was telling Jessica I'm like
this is the like they all you get lost
in all of them because you feel like
you're in that country a little but
Morocco more than any other cuz like you
go back past that like fountain and you
go back in the back and you literally
feel like you're in a different world
it's amazing it's it's it's transported
- is that a word
no but it's I like it I've eaten all the
restaurants there and they're all so
good - you know what we haven't those
spikes row table which is kind of new
already yeah but on the water it looks
at me one of our favorite things to do
we have this lentil salad and it came
from Marrakesh right yeah you have
cookbooks from there with you yeah we
have the Disney good because we're
Disney nerds but we make it all the time
it's so good so Danny vuc asked why do
you always stay in a resort and not
somewhere outside the park for less do
you want to tackle this one first sure I
mean there's I mean apart from being so
close there are so many things that you
get when you stay on property versus
saying off property you get the extra
magic hours which would be an hour
before three or three exactly you get
the transportation which is included so
you can literally hop on a bus or app on
a monorail or hop on a boat or whatever
and you're right where you want to go
it's so easy no you know I mean I mean
it really is amazing to put plus there's
something to say about like when you're
at the parks until like 10 o'clock or
you know whatever when the park closes
and then you go back and you're still
like in the magic when you get home it
makes all the difference in the world
even the value resorts in fact more
often the value resorts are the most
Disney theme so yeah when you go there
I mean you're saving money compared to
you know the other resorts there's a
camera and it's so Disney II so if you
don't want to leave that magic which I
never do on there I call it fake world
because it is your I think life is the
best but staying off property we we
don't do it just because of the ease of
everything else that Disney offers for
us I think one of the most important
things is how quickly coming into the
parks yeah
slash resort hop because restricted I'm
in the parks and only people that are
staying at the resort can be in the park
at those times unless you do that new
extra hours maybe but that's not on
nights when they're doing extra magic
hours so that's on you know that's a
hint for big surprise of course you
would know that
so almost starless asked disney hidden
gems and i'm gonna get to this kind of
in a weird way that's by hidden of
course cuz that's like if i see a video
about hidden gems it isn't like play
well you can't move or if I had to watch
later and I have like 15 of them photo
oh yeah or Disney World hauls oh my gosh
I have like 20 of my oh that's your new
Jam you always every morning what am i
watching the mess just a total mess
hey speaking of this shirt I got it
Kohl's and it's Lauren Conrad and if you
notice it says Minnie and Mickey all
over and it's cute
honestly making a budget so yeah no it
says Mickey - nice thank you
mine has Mickey on it yes I've had this
for a long time
Disney hidden gems the first thing I
think of and this is so we when we've
talked about it before and those that
are like Disney freaks like we are know
exactly what we mean when we say it but
my favorite hidden thing and it's not
even hidden at all so that's what I'm
saying I'm answering this weird okay
stop premise I guess is Disney dank
rides oh my gosh the bank run yes and
really what we mean is like dark rides
but they're dark rides on water that is
important because that's where the
dankness comes out I think is everything
it's the smell
it's that dinky snack the Disney game
thank you later okay so to give you an
example
he's just yesterday on Twitter somebody
followed me and in his little profile it
said my wife and I love Disney blah blah
blah blah and I love the smell of the
water in Pirates and I'm like well
that's it it's a new best friend
that's thickness that's the dankness of
the dank ride that is what dank is my
food you get into Disney on the very
first day like you fly in early in the
morning you go you go to the resort drop
off your luggage and then you go to the
parks like you gotta get on a dank ride
first thing right leg if you know what
you know other right has a date miss
small world spaceship earth there's no
water in spaceship finition it's not
just some water because no most of them
are most you know when I want the tank
any tank smell what's that great movie
right baby right has a den kitty and it
doesn't have water it's just darkened
day can move that episode of Fresh
Prince of bel-air when like I wasn't
Busta Rhymes but somebody came on like
it was like hey yo diggity diggity
diggity diggity what does it happen like
it could be thinkety thinkety thinkety
thinkety thinkety thinkety remember that
so like that's not really a hidden gem
but we're gonna do like a whole video
about these because there are so many
and I don't want to give too many way
but that is always the first thing I
think of like that is no one talks about
that but for whatever reason I guess
it's not really looks like the mole but
it's like the hidden magic of Disney
well and this is what I was not like the
other day well ya know so I'm like this
the other day so like people that go to
Disney for the first time they get so
bogged down and like booking the trip
that like by the time they get there
they're all the thinking is about Lucia
where is this restaurant where you
babies right first then this right but
like once you like have everything
planned and can actually like look
around you yeah to realize all those
hidden gems like little things like the
fact that they'll have like it that
place in Hollywood soon as we talked
about it in that vlog do you have it up
yet if it is we'll put it down low on
you yeah I
and like they have like Jimmy Fallon's
timecard and like all kinds of Hollywood
gems in a random cheap quick-service
restaurant at Hollywood Studios that no
one would know about and we have this
going but if you aren't worried about
just you know oh yeah you can see like
oh my gosh there's all this real movie
memorabilia not like fact similes but
like the actual ones I mean it is
amazing you know say you know this was
in Roger Rabbit like the movie like Who
Framed Roger Rabbit it's an actual prop
that's so cool it really is and then
like I mean on Main Street
you know actually going through and
looking around you you know you're so
worried about you know there's the
castle let's go let's take our picture
but if you can just take a step back and
you know if the the burden of the actual
trip is kind of relaxed what do we want
to say meliorate it exactly but then you
can actually start to find those hidden
gems that make all of us huge Disney
people unlike the fact that on Main
Street you can smell they pump like
chocolate chip cookie smell and they
pump sounds and and like the video you
just uploaded of Hollywood see you as
the owner streets of America they pump
um like Chinese food smell outside the
little Chinese fake Chinese restaurant
facade yeah it's gone now that's the
sound once the sounds of the New York
and then Francisco none of it's actually
happening it's just pumped and sound and
they think to do that to make it a so
much more realistic even though you know
it's not but you love it you told but
it's so real it really is the details in
like the like the parking meters and the
trash cans and everything is so well
thought out yeah it is amazing Marley
Pope asks do you have a Disney bucket
list if so what's on it mm-hmm
that's an interesting I feel like ride
wise we've written everything right I
mean unless it's like maybe a kiddie
ride that we just haven't yet right
Doris but I think even though as we've
written yeah I mean really so maybe like
restaurant wise or experience wise oh I
know what minded this what's yours
I want to parasail you know on seven
seas Lagoon
don't they do it on seven seas look good
I don't know I got over the
so yeah that's what I'm trying to do and
looking over the resorts to the Grand
Floridian and Polynesia and all those
that would be really cool
my never done it right yeah yeah we got
to do it one of my bucket list is lists
is to actually state the Polynesian and
the contemporary he's restated the grand
floridian I was saying there which is I
mean come on you guys that is amazing
and we're taking my parents there and I
cannot wait but I want to say it's a
Polynesian so bad cuz I love it yeah I'm
love going there to like in one of the
new ones
Patti Ola 75 asks I love Disney - are
you DBC members we are and love it love
your videos thank you
I'm reading it like I'm like reading a
book thank you that was a very nice
compliment
we are not no but and we are both kind
of learning about it as we go because
we're like well if we spend this much
money this much time oh yeah we just
begin yeah we're big numbers right
you're us yeah oh yeah the number yeah
the annual passes are amazing for us
it's totally worth it now for everyone
no but definitely monetarily
we've spent well over that getting even
more perks anyway that's again a whole
nother video but DVC like we're learning
more about and really we both learned a
lot about it from our favorite podcast I
feel like I talked about all the time
though they are it's a podcast called
resort loop it's like the only it's the
only Disney podcast I used to listen
like five Disney pod Canada I listened
to that one yeah that's like the only
podcast I listen to very well and
they're so positive or the me everything
they do has such a good spin on it I
feel like a lot of people were negative
it's so negative yeah but yeah Bob and
Tim on the resort yeah the two resort
lucam podcast man yeah and again that's
another thing that's part of the special
surprise but anyway they do we haven't
explained why I'm talking about Rosario
sorry they do these DVC roundtable
things with DBC members and it's usually
close to the same people in Egypt so
yeah give or take
and they just talk about the pros and
cons of it water you know the very
specific details if it's worth it for
you or not and and they go into detail
like because I mean a lot of people
everyone do you want to do sure you buy
resale or should you buy direct from
Disney should you I mean there's so much
that goes into it and they really do a
good job of explaining and
like once a month they've done like five
now something like that for five that
many it's been a quite a few but there's
so many details it's been not only that
they also do so many other podcasts but
yeah that's as far as he goes that's the
way to listen to it and learn about it
for sure so those are all the questions
were going to answer over here but like
I said you can definitely check out his
channel to watch the next installment of
questions it's already up we're
uploading these at the same time right
right that means I'm gonna edit mine
you're gonna yours we're gonna see who
edits it better why it's gonna be like
so similar how different will it be I
don't know probably not I don't like
PowerPoint slide transitions like the
bars and like the checkers yep you can't
do that right now nice right very
magical nice transition because we're
still in the same position I'll just cut
the new zine papa
so anyway or the kind where it like
takes your picture and like turns into a
square and like spins it yeah like the
square yeah the way it's like the old
America's Funniest Home Videos yeah oh
my gosh I guess anyway so we'll see you
guys over there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
