share with you guys what we bought in
full Walt Disney World which there's a
lot in here but also in Universal so
I'll do the Disney part first cuz I know
a lot of you guys are I don't want to
say more interested but a lot more of
you guys are Disney people like I am but
it was our first time going to Universal
I'll put prices of everything at least
the prices I know of I have the receipt
still so as long as I can still figure
out I'll list all of that below in case
you're curious or you're budgeting for
your next trip whatever side note they
also have a Disney shop parks app that's
what it's called
and I ended up I haven't ordered from
there before because I was getting a
gift for my parents before we took them
from there and then also bigger things
that we want that we don't necessarily
want to pack and bring home with us we
just usually will scan it in the store
and then save it to our cart and then
just order it later so that it just
arrives at our place so that is one
thing so I'll try and see if I can find
these on the app in case you just want
to buy it I'll list it below so I'm just
gonna start grabbing things one of the
things that you if you follow me on
Instagram you probably saw a ton of is
this backpack I loved it it was kind of
pricey if I remember it was like 45 or
50 dollars or maybe it was 40 but I've
been in love with it for a couple years
and every time I go I'm like I want that
bag and so finally I was just like you
know what I'm just gonna buy it so what
I like about it is it's got this little
Mickey it has this little Minnie Mouse
charm and it's still zip tied to this
because it wasn't connected at all so I
don't know what that's about so I'm just
gonna leave it subside for now but it
has this little pocket here which is
perfect for holding you know what did I
hold in your lip balm SPF like things
like that and then in here I kept an
empty water bottle so I could refill it
as much as I needed and then other
things like my phone and things I didn't
want to be like too easily accessible
like if other people were trying to like
steal from my bag so I had those things
in here and then it just cinches
together and then there is a little bit
of velcro here to velcro it down and it
just it's like a small sized bag I got
so many compliments I think because this
is marketed as like I think it's
supposed to be like a kid's bag a lot of
adults hadn't like noticed it or thought
about using it like for yourself but I
loved it it was the perfect size it was
still small enough that it can fit in MO
unless it was like packed full it could
fit most of the little elastic bags like
on rides or I could just put it under my
legs and it was fine I love this I'm
bring it with me every time I go and yes
so I'm so glad I just finally finally
bought it so if you're new to my channel
or maybe you haven't been following me
for a while my husband Tyler's actually
a Disney travel agent so if you're
interested I mean shameless plug I gotta
mention it it's my husband I'll link his
website he also has a YouTube channel
where we put all of our Disney vlogs so
ours from this trip will be coming up
soon on there we've got tons of footage
so I'll link his channel and his company
below next thing I bought I've been
eyeing for a while I was at Animal
Kingdom and I finally bought some of
these leopard print years they had
giraffe print this and then I think they
had zebra as well but these are the ones
I liked the most and if you notice these
are separated up here more than like
regular ears are and I think that's so
perfect because I think it's supposed to
be a little more realistic because it is
the animal kingdom and that's their
focus so I just loved these they were
around the same price as any of the ears
but I am just so glad I bought them
because I ended up wearing them to Epcot
I think one day I warmed Magic Kingdom
it doesn't it's not like you have to
only wear an animal kingdom so I
definitely got some use out of these and
again I'll bring these with me the next
time my gosh this is in like the most
random order ever I only bought one mug
we usually buy like 1 to 2 mugs and
there was another one I had my eyes on
and I was gonna buy and then like on the
last day we just forgot but this one we
did buy it's one of the larger ones and
it's got kind of that chalkboard look to
it and it just has happiest place on
earth it's got the castle Once Upon a
Time never grow up be our guest believe
in magic it's just such a whimsical
design and I just loved it and so I'm
excited now that we film this we can
actually use it just been in the bag
here it was $15 so it was you know their
moms are kind of pricey for what it is
but at the same time like it makes me
happy every single day when I use it so
it's worth it to me um the next thing I
bought is this little clip and one of my
subscribers had tweeted a picture of it
at me a long time ago and then she
reminded me of it which I was so
thankful for so I ended up buying it I
bought it in the black I kind of wish I
would have gotten the boot there's like
more of a brown like tortoiseshell type
one but
I ended up buying the black one because
I couldn't find the other one but it's
just the perfect little clip to just
hold all your hair I thought it was so
cute and again it's like kind of a
hidden Mickey wouldn't necessarily
notice it if you saw someone wearing it
but you might and that's what I loved
about it and this was I think like five
dollars it wasn't too pricey I mean it's
kind of pricey for a hair clip but for a
Disney souvenir it's not that pricey
this was a free one we got it from the
luau we finally went to it at the
Polynesian cuz we stayed there the last
half of our trip and so I figured I
would show it to you guys I don't know
if I'll keep it forever I mean you know
it's really itchy I remember everyone
was like so anyway um we also bought
some magnets which again we buy one
every time we stay at a different resort
we buy a magnet from there at least we
try to so we bought this was our second
time staying at the Grand Floridian but
we bought another magnet from there
because it's so much just so pretty we
put all of our magnets on our washer and
dryer because it just kind of makes
laundry more of a happy time cuz you see
all your magnets from everywhere but
also it doesn't clutter up our kitchen
which as small as it is so this one was
just a really nice one from the Grand
Floridian and then we also got probably
one of my favorite magnets of all time
this one from the Polynesian Village
Resort and it just got Mickey and he's
just like we're in his little he's got a
little ukulele and he's wearing a little
button down with the collar and it's
just so something about this just makes
me so happy so they had a lot of this
design there in the gift shop and I was
like I literally want everything but I
was good and I only got this but I loved
it so much we always write like the year
I've got you know like you buy like
Sharpie paint marker type metallic gold
metallic silver they show up really well
on the backs of these kinds of things so
I usually write Noel I always write the
year or the month if I remember it of
when we were there another magnet we got
was well this is from Universal but I
was will show you it's just $7 this
little silver and gold Universal Studios
magnet it was honestly out of all the
ones we saw it was kind of our favorite
which is kind of simple but we both
liked it now we both got a pin and again
that's another thing we're not pin
trader or collectors not yet anyway but
we always pick out one each that's
special to us and so the one he picks
since it's the
first year of him having his travel
agency is this pin that's got like retro
like planes on it with like the retro
Mickey head and it just says fly me to
the Disney parks and I thought that was
so perfect so he loved that one and then
the one I picked out is a figment and
it's got these little rainbows and the
reason I wanted this one was because I
just I'm switching schools this year I
taught at one school and I'm switching
districts completely and teaching on a
different side of town I don't know
anyone at the school and so it's a
really scary time for me but it's also
really exciting because I feel like I'll
be able to really do a lot of the things
that that the reason I got into teaching
and so like imagination just kind of
connects obviously to teaching for me so
because I was so excited about this
change in my life I felt that this kind
of represented that so anyway the only
other pins we got were
happily-ever-after ones for technically
it was our one-year anniversary while we
were there I think they might have had
anniversary pins too but they give us
these which was fine and then while we
were there the Shanghai Disney Resort
opened so we got these at Magic Kingdom
the day it opened it just says Shanghai
Disney Resort and I was like that's kind
of cool because you know there's only
one opening day for that so we will have
always been at a Disney park while it
opened that up all right see also I got
some things for my classroom so one
thing I got were these little Minnie
Mouse head binder clips and they had
Mickey Minnie and then they also had
ones at the castle I wanted all of them
but these were pricey these were $10 I
was like but I really want them because
I used them and I know I look at them
and smile each time but um the only
thing was I had to did I qui that I
instagrammed out what you guys voted for
and most of you guys voted for Minnie
Mouse so I was like I'll go with that
and then I also got some pencils just to
have it my desk
these just say Disney parks and it's got
different characters on each one and
they were just so colorful and cute and
I liked that even the erasers were
different colors so I was like you gotta
these were also $10 you also got it not
a treat but a toy for our dog Pinocchio
he's a little beagle and he just turned
one year old so it's a little did any of
you guys I know a lot of you guys went
either my dog makes noise like in my
videos things like that a lot of you
guys say oh my gosh my
heard your dog and so he was like
freaking out what Tyler you have to know
that as soon as you squeak that you will
go from a dead sleep oh I was sorry
Pinocchio's that's a new squeak yeah we
haven't given it to him yet we're
waiting
sorry Pinocchio anyway um but it's a
little Micky bar it's so cute and it's
just a little squeaky thing again this
one is $12.99 obviously pricey for dog
toy but I was like I don't think he'll
be able to tear this up he might but I
don't think he will so it might last a
while and plus it's just too cute I was
like you gotta we also get in an
ornament each year we've got lots of
traditions and so this one is a little
Mickey head but Tyler loves this
Victorian like Mickey Christmas stuff
that they have and so this has Mickey
and Minnie and a little jewel Mickey in
the middle and then we figured we would
put a picture of us on this trip in here
since it was our one-year anniversary we
just figured it was kind of a special
time so yeah I thought that was just
absolutely lovely and I love the little
bow there as well it's just so cute we
also bought this notebook and it's just
a really simple black kind of leather
feel notebook that says Walt Disney
World and the first page says this
personal journal belongs to and she's
got the castle and stuff which I thought
was cute and then it's just line pages
that have like little castle emblems at
the bottom we bought this because we
wanted this to be like our Disney travel
log so we wanted to go back to the very
first time we went and just write in as
many details as we can remember and then
that way from here on out as we travel
we can just add to it we could even do a
day by day each day saying we went to
this park we experienced you know for
example on this past trip we rode like
frozen the new frozen ride for the first
time we were there and it opened we were
there when the new Sauron opened so a
lot of exciting things were happening
that it would have been cool to kind of
log in here so we are both very excited
about that and then the last Disney
things we bought assuming I remembered
everything were these plates now these
plates for each $7.99 and we were going
to get like one and then we were like
well maybe we'll get two and we were
like forget it let's just get all four
we know we'll use them so it's the
different lands in the Magic Kingdom so
they're just kind of like that plastic
composite I don't know what it's made of
but it this one is Adventureland so
you'll see it's got you know Dumbo and
it's got
No I tried to call it elephant Dumbo but
I think it's really just the elephant's
like in the Jungle Cruise duh Jungle
Cruise bow and just little tea keys and
Dole Whip and things like that and then
my favorite land Tomorrowland and so
it's got like rockets and Space Mountain
and just all kinds of things like that
and the backs of them are different
colors too to match it corresponds with
the colors on the front fantasy land
which is the prettiest plate I think
it's got the castle in the middle it's
got even mr. toad
there's Dumbo things like that and that
one has turquoise on the back and then
Frontierland which has kind of a short
truce and it's just got the steamboat
and a little carriage and all kinds of
things like that really a carriage it's
a wagon anyway so this might have been
out of everything we bought these might
be my favorite things we've bought
because I don't know that we've ever
just bought dishes from there and these
were really easy to transport back since
I knew they probably wouldn't break we
just wrapped him and closed so let me go
ahead and show you what we bought at
Universal we didn't buy as much we were
only there for one day we were stuffing
both parts into one day just cool though
one of my friends is the stage manager
there so we get to see her there which
was awesome so I bought this red hat
because I have my blue monsters
University hat and I love it I love that
kind of looks worn I wore it all the
time but I like it's like the only hat I
own and I do like wearing them from time
to time so I wanted a red kind of worn
one and I saw this one and I was like
that's the one
it says 0-7 and it says Gryffindor
Quidditch and that would be Harry's
number a seeker number 7 so I thought oh
my gosh this is too too perfect even
Tyler's like I kind of like to have like
you can borrow it if you want but I
always have like makeup like on the
inner rim I have to wash these all the
time anyone else has that problem so
Tyler bought a wand from Ollivanders and
he was so excited he always wanted to
get one and when we were in London we
went to the actual platform 9 and 3/4
that they have at Kings Cross station
like there's a gift shop there and it's
just fun and there's like a photo
opportunity but um they sold wands there
and Tyler thought about but he was like
no I've waited this long to get a wand I
need it needs to be from the actual
Ollivanders so we went there and he got
Harry Potter's wand and he was so what
just fell out here he was so excited
it's not they
they sell interactive ones where you can
do stuff around the parks with it and
they also sell just straight-up like
decorative cool wands so that's what he
bought it was a little bit cheaper but
the interactive part it seemed to not
always work this is it and it is Sony
and he was so excited it was cool to
just watch him go around there I told
him if I were to buy what I didn't end
up getting one if I were to ever get one
I think I would get Luna Lovegood z--
wand because I think Luna Lovegood is
like the sweetest character and she just
is a good friend and I just loved her
she was with my favorite characters
anyway so that was absolutely awesome
and then I got this shirt I think it's a
men's shirt but I got it anyway because
I loved it
it's a long sleeved t-shirt and it's got
grey with black and I got it in the size
small yeah it just says Hogwarts
railways because of course we got to
ride the Hogwarts train but this I just
love because shirts like this I don't
necessarily wear outs like I can work in
them or anything like that but I like
wearing around the house as PJs just as
loungewear and maybe even out just from
time to time I don't know but I loved
this one it's like a little bit more
loose fitted and it's exactly what I was
looking for so that was everything that
we got there I think if you enjoy check
out my other Disney parks hauls I've got
quite a few on my channel now I'll link
them below honestly this was a pretty
darn big haul but I feel like some of my
other ones like when we went on our
honeymoon
last summer I got a lot and I think
almost everything I bought is still
available in stores and in the apps so
I'll link that video below if you're
just watching a bunch of Disney hauls
and you want to watch more but other
than that I hope that you'll subscribe
to catch more definitely check out my
husband Tyler's channel so you can see
