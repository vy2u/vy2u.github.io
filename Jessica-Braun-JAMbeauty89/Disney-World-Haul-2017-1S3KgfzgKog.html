vlogs like travel videos and then we're
just we're starting doing likely vlogs
too so we've actually just finished
today filming like our next weekly vlog
but it really just kind of like by week
well yeah but a lot of stuff this was
kind of weird though too because we were
gone so you know the Disney vlogs got to
go over that and then we're getting
yakking so so it all comes together in a
weird way but we're also in the middle
of uploading all of our Disney vlogs to
his channel I say we it's really you
doing all that work that's all you
anyway but we blog the entire time we
were in Disney so if you love Disney
they're so far like I enjoyed watching
you of course like selfishly I'm in them
and that's but they're really really fun
lead actress I just really like really
really identify with her I just she's
just so real you know what I mean anyway
anyway so those vlogs are going up like
there's one up as we're Phil
but they'll probably be a couple up by
the time this is going up so I will link
the vlogs that are up down below I will
also leak his channel definitely
subscribe shameless plug I don't care
he's my husband and I love that why
don't we start with my ears did you buy
a hat while we were in Disney at all I
did not
you didn't you thought about it you
already have like a Mickey hat that you
wear all that yeah I kind of stick with
one hat until it falls off my head and
then I get a new hat I have lots of hats
that are like have they ever fallen off
your head it's a figure of speech
what are getting an isle Pinocchio voice
our doggies name was Pinocchio if you
doesn't know it's Pinocchio but he goes
by oh I don't does everyone have a voice
for their dog like are we being weird or
your cat eyes are my friend
no weird with it yeah well I think
everybody does like or a lot of people
do cuz like I saw a friend Ben and he
has a dog named Rob Ross you kind of
talk a good boil hey man oh boy how's it
going and then else Pinocchio who talks
about us and others with his valleys
he's very concerned about a lot of
things but he's Valley
he's family Walsh alright first thing
let's talk well my ears I found them and
if you'll see in the vlogs I found them
like the night we got there I looked for
them and I'm like I heard like that day
is when they started being sold or
something like that I'm an amazing
subscriber and I were snapping back and
forth she was telling me about where
they're sold like where I can find them
they're so awesome anyway so the net I
didn't find it that night at Disney
springs and then the next day we went to
Magic Kingdom right and we happen to go
in like the main gift shop there the
Emporium and they were there a whole
wall of them oh my
and the lady who worked there yeah I did
throw some elbows get some ladies out of
the way no but the lady who works what
she said I can't believe you guys found
him she said you know they've been in
stock but they've been out of stock for
like a couple weeks so they just
happened to be that we were there that
morning and she said they just can't
keep them in stock they just every time
they put them up they're gone but I love
them so much and I'm really excited to
have them the other thing I'll jump out
real fast because I'm jingling it this
is a magic band holder so the new magic
bands you can pop well not pop you have
to unscrew and we have the little screw
it comes with it when you buy it which
is nice
you just had it I was like going around
Disney asking like doesn't even have a
little screwdriver and everyone's like
no you're like talking about and I told
him I was born they're like weird like
they've never been asked like really no
one's asked and then we realized the
little screwdrivers in the package with
this but it had a little bow it was a
Minnie Mouse turned into a Mickey Mouse
it popped off like this first day mrs.
really sat but it still looks cute but
just fair warning
don't you even bother buying the Minnie
Mouse unless you have superglue to
superglue anyway
pull it off reglue it yeah I'm I'm
actually really sad but I love Mickey as
well so it's fine but I just hooked it
on my book bag which I'll show you in a
little bit and it was great cuz I could
just go know and do my magic man it's so
much easier than this it's no easier I
just don't like having all my wrists it
drives me crazy
clashes my outfits like there's so many
considerations you have to take into
account I love this we also got mugs so
pretty much every time we go we get mugs
I mean right I mean like especially
that's like three or four trips we've
gone wery like alright well you know
what's a fun thing that we do like
everyday drink coffee and then so we're
like all right let's get mugs we just
you know we need them because we need
these things so we decided we're gonna
get mugs like every time we go which is
awesome but at the same time because for
a long time we've only got magnets and
that was great because they travel
really well they so yeah we still do
yeah but we were like we should get mugs
which is awesome because when they're
home and we're you drinkin for them
really yeah this is great but traveling
with them it's kind of a yeah you always
have to have an intro yeah if you drive
is no big deal but yeah you got to make
sure that they don't ya cuz they throw
those things anyway so was two years
first we got where's this once upon a
time
you're like hearing you talk about it so
it said I'm trying to sound really cool
man it's up happily ever after and uh
you know once about the time so it's
pretty neat it's a beautiful very manly
it really is it has all the different
like castles and palaces I'm gonna be
honest I'm not sure that I know all of
them that is Jasmine's right there
Cinderella Castle
tangled Rapunzel's Castle I call her
tangled yeah I am five the pink one
that's gonna be Sleeping Beauty oh I
know that's tangled
Rapunzel's our know so maybe this is
buting the beasts where's that
snow-white with like the huts
I think it's no why because that would
be Rapunzel's and then this is
definitely Ariel's like in water so it's
cool
it is like actually the pretty smoke I
think that I own I'm so excited they had
him everywhere so you'll be able to find
it but I really I'm I've been using like
every morning I have to force myself to
use other mugs what about yours so I got
one so we've looked around a lot I'm
like so so a trend I've noticed with
Disney's their mugs now are huge like
almost all the like literally literally
large mugs and everyday you know I kept
seeing ones that I like them like but
they're so big and we have some of the
ones that are big but the problem is
like I feel like you know I'll drink
half the cup and it'll be ice cold but
imma get halfway down there like yeah so
both and so they're huge and so I found
a couple that I liked and you know
whatever but then we were in the Epcot
and the France Pavillion and Jessica saw
this one and I'm like yeah I'm gonna
need to get that one because it's gooey
that might be my favorite Remy is Remy
yeah that might be my favorite Pixar
movie just because I love Paris and
that's where you look yeah I love this
movie and it's a little chef's hat if
you can tell and it's got Remy on it
it's pretty well and then it's gonna
ratatouille
but this little things a spoon there too
it's really well thought out of the
place that I saw I didn't see anywhere
else did you I know yes in the freeway
notice yeah but yeah I love to cook I
love Paris I love this movie it's a
win-win yeah it's awesome
okay the next thing I bought where did I
get this in Disney I themed no not the
Emporium is no where did you end up
getting that Oh Hollywood Studios yep
in majority in street you know it's a
Hollywood know the bard kind of a yeah
you'll find it it always has really cute
stuff in it but look at this bag I've
worn this not in Disney as well the one
I used to have is like a sequined red
bag with white polka dots and I still
use it I still love it and I used it for
a lot of that trip until I bought this
but it's kind of scratchy like when I
set it on my lap for a ride or when
we're on the bus monitor whatever
covered in sequin
yeah and so it's kind of scratching a
bit scratched my legs up so over time
I'm like okay it's kind of driving me
crazy so this one has a little more
structure it's like a fake pleather hold
on sorry something
it's funny about that though is
literally somebody recognized you
because of that bag we were walking
around we were I think we're walking
into animals it was Megan and yes and
they said I noticed your bag before I
noticed you because they knew where you
were all the time this is a big deal
that she's getting a new bag no so now
all everyone will have to look for this
bag but now I everyone will have it cuz
it's so cute so it's got the polka dots
the stripes the bows but I wore it like
we went to a baseball game with
Pinocchio actually and I wore it to that
like it's a it's a good sized bag just
generally it's comfortable to wear on
the inside there's a little bit of you
kind of like snap it so it pulls it shut
but there's little bits of compartments
in there it's awesome we could easily
fit everything we need like a water
bottle or two some snacks phones a chart
like a portable charger chapstick you
know you can fit anything you need first
okay if you have a kid it might be
different you might need more we always
talked about when we were kids like when
we would run training package for trips
yeah camera my chapsticks
my blue suckers yeah blue lips oh my
gosh lives on this trip and he was
awesome
would you eat I mean it had alcohol in
it was that yeah but still of my royal
blue or Seneca in the Morocco pavilion I
had straight up blue mouth that I was
like I'm like a little kid eating a
sucker worth it it's so good anyway so
this is awesome
now a word about that bag Jessica had
snapped on snapchat about how she wanted
this one smaller bag and everybody's
like hey you need to buy this bag and
it's like alright I'm gonna do that it
was a really expensive bag okay paint so
I was gonna do that and I literally I
commented back to like everybody on
snapchat I was like I'm gonna do that
and I didn't do that because like the
next day she saw this bag and I said
well do you want the other Burger noon
with this one she said I want this one
so to all you people who snapped me I
did see it
obviously I responded to you but I'm
saying thank you because oh yeah because
utopia because you were also awesome in
real life said I have this freaking bag
you jerk
no I'm kidding no bring my shirt he was
like five minutes back she wants it yeah
like yeah
but she wanted that bag more I would
have bought that baguette I did I kind
of change my mind because I was like you
know what when I'm in Disney I need a
little more space in that little bag and
I didn't know if I would wear that bag
enough in real life to warrant the price
tags so I love you guys but I changed my
mind and this was so like in my opinion
expensive it's still like $40 but I will
use it $40 worth we go like three times
a year we're trying we're already
planning our next trip and if you didn't
know he's a Disney travel agent I know a
lot of you guys that love does he
already know that but that's like his
job too so it's kind of so I got some
t-shirts while we were there which again
I have I don't know most of my teacher
okay so most of what you wear is
t-shirts well I wear a lot you should
put jib but what I'm saying is I do I
mean most of my shirts that I have to
have nothing on them except I have a
handful of Disney shirts that I wear in
the parks but like I don't know at home
I don't like you know funny slogans and
stuff like that you know my shirt so
they're all just playing except for the
Disney ones I own but I've had the ones
that I've had forever mm-hmm I was like
all right I'm gonna get some new
t-shirts that are like Disney t-shirts
to wear there and first of all this time
we were there two rides closed the great
movie ride and Ellen's energy event two
of our favorites ya know both of them
actually had like special t-shirts made
because it was there last week so this
is one that I'm wearing the universe of
energy extinct August 2017 and this is
the Annual Pass Holder shirt I think the
other one that you can see here yes turn
around all major breaking stuff yeah you
can universe of energy so it's part of
it as dinosaurs so that's why they're
using the word extinct and it says Epcot
Center at Walt Disney World Epcot Center
this is I think the other one yet the
other one that wasn't the annual pass
holder one had this on the front yes and
wasn't it like maybe gray or red
different color yeah but it basically
the same thing just a little bit
different and same thing with this but I
end up getting the one that wasn't the
pass holder one because I liked this one
better
so this is for the great movie ride I
think it says what that's a wrap
great unit celebration of classic movies
yeah it does say that's a wrap this was
really my favorite yeah like this one
like universe of energy I was sad but I
have to admit when we wrote it I fell
asleep
I think we've logged about that too I
fell asleep writing it I was just tired
and
like no I fell asleep during the very
night it's like but great movie ride man
yeah so we've we've logged about that
and then I also filmed both of those
rights hopefully I'll get like those
videos up soon yeah it's like a hole
right through of those two rides because
they'll never I was kind of hoping great
movie ride I don't know I feel like they
could have updated it but I'm also
excited about the new write it supposed
to be like well it'll be great but I
really hope because I love Ellen
DeGeneres I was really hoping that she
was gonna do like a new updated version
of that or a new update you know being
the right somehow but you know it should
be what it what are they changing to
guardians of the galaxy so it'll be cool
but it's pretty funny if she just kind
of came out of nowhere like hi Ellen
DeGeneres here and that would be awesome
but most people do that why are you here
but then this is the other shirt that I
got all day every day awesome but it's
funny because it is almost like all day
every day because I'm a Disney travel
agent so it really is what I do all day
every day gosh it's so odd that shirt is
such a good shirt though um I guess I
can add what my shirts mm-hmm well I
have one that I can't find so he find it
won't walk about it but it was really
cute and it was it was just like the
same setup like a baseball shirt like
with the red sleeves and it was white
and it said vacation mode and it had a
red castle that we've got yes you'll see
it but I can't find it we looked
everywhere for like 20 minutes it's
somewhere I hope so I bought this
towards the end of our trip at the same
story about this book bag from so in the
Hollywood studio story we kind of match
and I didn't see it anywhere else but so
it has this little red bow that kind of
we need to like tack like so tech you
know but it's really really cute so
tacky but it's got little minis and
hearts in the register I just thought
was so pretty because it's obviously
Disney but I could totally wear this in
real life and you know no Mickey RL no
one would care anyway yep this one
however was so much cheaper because it
was at the store at Disney springs
called Uniqlo and so it's got all of
these polka dots but it has little
Mickey's strewn throughout as well and
it was awesome cuz it was like $14
most shirts like this it isn't like all
my other shirts for like 30 35 40 so I
mean they're expensive so this one was
much cheaper they had a lot of cute like
Disney stuff that was like low-key
Disney he was awesome and then the other
one that I actually have is this one and
it just says all these different Disney
II things like best day ever
again clearly a lot of these things are
inspired by people that have worked hard
on Etsy so I do kind of like feel bad
but I was like I saw it they're like I
really want it but you can tell it was
clearly like their honor because I feel
like the last several years we've gone
it's been a lot of the same stuff yeah
and it's been kind of not boring but
it's just yeah and I think they must
have liked some new people come in or a
revelation or something because now all
this cool stuff that they have on Etsy
like that they probably saw people
wearing in the parks like we could be
making money on this if we had better
designers and all that stuff and a
perfect world they would have hired
someone I like to think that they found
these people on Etsy and hired them but
you know they didn't I wish that would
have been best case now anyway so I love
all the shirts and I wear them for real
- I don't just wear them in the Disney
Cars but we need to go I want to go 200
this Halloween party Mickey's
not-so-scary hello everyone this is the
cutting board we actually talked about
this in our vlogs as well I think that
one's already up about this the very
first day we got there so we have been
eyeing this cutting board for ever and
we finally were like because it was like
50 bucks it was but we're like let's
just bite the bullet let's just do it
but what's so cool so have these
different things here and they slide out
and there's what probably four of them
five of them whatever and like one says
meat one says vegetables this one says
beef there's chicken you know whatever
Oh primal is fish but you pull them in
and out so that it helps prevent like
cross-contamination but they almost like
here in the back and we have talked
about buying this forever and we really
finally were like alright we're just
gonna do it so I'm so excited to own
this you know so we're Nicki on it yeah
and so it's just a cutting board just
sits there but then you just slide these
things in an out and what's closer I bet
I mean watch to see cuz yeah like
vegetables except that you're cutting
well you probably just fold it up and
then right into the pot how cool is that
that's pretty cool I bet it I bet it
bends a little bit anyway um yeah I'm
role excited about these and its bamboo
all right so I have an issue yes because
I'm like a did you notice those are like
sparkly no that's so cool um I love
stuffed animals but like I'm an adult
and I you know I know I'm almost an
adult I don't know I just like have this
problem and I love them and maybe like
it's I feel like maybe a lot of people
are this way but I love stuffed animals
as a kid too so like I slowly been
collecting like I got this at a garage
sale
actually it was at a subscribers garage
sale just by happenstance she like
happen to know she was hers but she was
just there no I think well either way do
you man we bought this Dumbo for like I
don't know a dollar two dollars and he's
like in perfect condition and he looks
like Pinocchio cuz he's got Joey you
know here's a people and Pinocchio's
giant soft ears anyway so I love this so
it's it's like in the corner of our
closet he's just so cute and then Tyler
when he was there for like Disney like
some training and stuff he had he I
wasn't there and I was sad and he knows
I love Figment so he bought me a figment
doll and I love him and he's so soft and
then I also got like through Disney
movie club this little Haunted Mansion
Simpson the only reason I show you this
is because we bought another such animal
and it's a Simba a little young Simba
because my pug that what really it's my
parents bug so when I lived at home his
name is Simba and so I just love Simba
I'm gonna be honest if I see if he's a
tiny little bug he's a little bigger but
um we bought it really we were gonna
give it to them like as a toy and I was
like I don't know like it's got like
wait does it have beans I thought it had
beans in it now I'm thinking of the
Muppets bean
anyway we decided to keep it not give it
to him that's all keeping it shove it
that's all
so Tyler is checking the door someone's
at the door but I figure I'll keep
talking so the next thing I bought for
myself was this key holder and I haven't
used it yet so I'm really excited to use
it I currently am using one actually
that one of you guys sent me and it's
really cute it's pink and it has like
teachery things around it but I've had
for like two years it's getting really
dirty so for my car keys I love this
it's like a really nice like I think it
might be real leather I really don't
know but it feels really well made and
it's got this bronze little Mickey and
then a little Mickey thing to hold the
keys and then a little D for Disney so I
really loved it and I kept eyeing it we
stayed at the pop century this time
we've stayed recently it like the
Polynesian the grandfa leading like
really expensive one so we've been to
the Paulo the hop century before and we
loved it but it's been a while so we
were so excited to stay there again
because it's so Disney and you it's just
awesome I just love it I love the value
resorts anyway this was at the gift shop
there and I kept eyeing it I'm like I
really like it and so I finally bought
it it was kind of expensive as $17.99
but I'm like you know what if I'm gonna
use this every single day for like a
couple years it's probably worth the
money and it will definitely hold up so
I was really excited to own this I can't
wait to put my keys on it today okay so
we're gonna talk about some snap we have
a lot more stuff but I figured we're
eating it snowman's will tell about it
so we have three snack credits left so
we bought some things and actually these
are a decent use of your credit so these
are the Chippendale snack company
Mountain mix and of course there's M&amp;amp;Ms
in it so that's really all I'm going for
but it's a classic like trail mix like
that but we also got nature trail mix
and this one we have an open yet but
it's got sunflower kernels raisins
hippie fests whatever that is
almonds and cashews so also really good
just know like M&amp;amp;Ms or raisins no there
are a reasons I literally just said that
and then the other one I got was the
Goofy's candy company sour worms now I
want one of these I didn't know she
bought these she bought these and hid
them from me there were my nightstand I
know I do you love Halloween all oh me
too
honestly I mean I forgot I bought but
they were already open which mean are
you mmm-hmm Mickey straws looks like
Mardi Gras oh it does the colors but we
got so what we got at the lunching pad
that's where it was we got those like
slushies and they each came with a
Mickey straw and so we're like oh yeah
when you use you straws all the time cuz
you drink like liquor set and whatever
out of Lucroy
you know but yeah euros drinking that
out of a straw so you will actually use
these like all like hardcore and then we
can watch them and they're so amazing
and they were free with us yeah and
we've never owned them how is it
possible that we never bought a drink
before that comes with these I feel like
these come with a decent amount I don't
know but the smoothies were it's not
credit to with the diet plan which was
awesome that they're not smoothies
they're Slurpees they're oh he's the
blue slush he knows another way we got
blue blue mouth what flavor is it blue
low this one was actually a gift and I'm
kind of sad we didn't buy one for
ourselves too because it's really cool
too so this is actually for my mom
because this that theme she's a teacher
and the theme this year is what make a
difference in the world or something
like that
mm-hmm so she said you know we asked her
you know what do you want you there's
anything that has like a Mickey with a
world something like that whatever was
so we found this and this is one of the
only things that we found but it's got
Mickey this was on the Main Street one
of the Arriba's brothers like the
crystal yeah in that crystal story on on
Main Street and it's got Mickey on top
and then there you know the world
underneath that's so cool it is so
beautiful yeah we were talking about
trying to buy crystal they're just so
expensive but no buying like crystal
pieces for likely of this area in our
bathroom that would look really great in
cabinet yeah we don't really know what
to put in it yeah we're like we can put
perfume and cologne that's fine but then
there's other shelves so it's like I
don't know so we talked about collecting
things like this but we didn't find one
that didn't really love to know we
talked about is maybe doing Oh snow
globes yeah that's right and we didn't
abide it oh we were gonna order him on
the app because we didn't check a bag so
we thought well we'll just no those are
tricky yeah so we would just do it and
order it and we haven't done that yet
but that would be a good thing for us to
do is to order a snow globe who's the
head to net the castle in it or
something like that yeah we only get
like different snow globes you know from
all over the world you also bought this
for our niece Emmy we haven't given it
to her yet so we have a couple of gifts
we didn't we just didn't um show because
we've already given them to them but we
she really liked some Elsa so we bought
her this is
so hopefully she'll like that what do we
get that we don't have we got my dad a
little sheriff Mickey badge from
Adventureland cuz he wears cowboy hats
right man yeah I say adventure and then
we also got my mom a really cute
polka-dotted mini shirt from I think the
France pavilion maybe that she really so
cute on her and then we also got my dad
a mug that had a lot of Disneyworld cuz
we took them to Disney World last summer
and it was awesome that we have all the
blogs of that on your channel too but um
so we got them something and then um
laughs so I'm still eating the trail mix
no it's delicious I just swallowed my
last fight again um for our friend Ryan
right mm-hmm but it was really cool it
was just like a clear shot glass but it
had like the castle edged into it is
really cool is very very Class A Class a
Disney um okay so one thing I'm really
nerdily excited about we've had this for
a while they dont sell it anymore we
didn't see anything but it's a Disney
World Press coin collection thing and so
we kind of started slowly collecting
pennies and this trip we like went
really hard and brought a bunch of
quarters a bunch of pennies and we were
like on the hunt so we filled a lot more
of this and we only have like one
pressed quarter well so since we decided
this is a really cool cheap souvenir to
do you can get him for the rides the
resorts whatever we were like we saw
this that they were selling it's just
another holder and we don't need it yet
but we saw it we were like that is so
cool like we don't love it yeah and how
it's like kind of retro Disney it's just
really cool so we were like what if we
just buy it now and we'll just have
everyone we need it cuz we I mean they
get new ones like every year it seems so
we didn't want it to be gone by the time
we need it in like two years so anyway
so we bought it even though we don't
need it but we did also get some new
press pennies I mean my favorite one
that we got was um the Haunted Mansion
one it has one of the hitchhiking ghosts
that's my favorite what's the favorite
you got what's the fate I can't say that
yeah I love laughing plays one of the
Black Crowes an RV because my lineage is
Norwegian yeah that racist cool yeah we
had a lot of cool ones oh we got an
Imagine
Asian Institute one for Epcot I love
that one century because that's where we
stayed this time lots of good ones lots
of goodies as I mentioned earlier we
have been getting into like magnets so
every time we go
not even just Disney but anywhere we try
and get magnets because they're easy to
travel with you know they're small
whatever so we didn't even put them on a
fridge we put them on our washer and
dryer yeah but actually we're addressing
them a little different and I'm gonna
hopefully do it the next couple months
so you'll see in our vlogs but I'm gonna
I think I'm gonna do something different
in our laundry room with the magnets so
we'll see anyway so we got a couple this
time so we got Disney's pop century
resort because the last time we stayed
there we didn't use to collect these so
now I don't think I think it's kind of
new that they have this kind of stuff
again for each resort for the RISM yeah
yeah then we got Pandora because that's
the new one that just opened and it was
the first time first time saying it was
it's cool super cool and then we got one
with the ear on it too because you know
we want one for each to you know each
year we go so this one's just got Mickey
sorcerer Mickey who's my favorite Mickey
he's the best and last but not least we
saw this one as we will let the last day
and we get Pinocchio would whoop that
and it's got all the dogs from the
different movies on it that's all he's a
Disney dog too so put your dog's picture
WiDi all those bones too it's kind of
Lady and the Tramp what's got olive oil
Pluto I mean it's got Muno from
Cinderella that's the one dog the Pug
that's one Pokemon mordida maybe she
does all of one company so what about
the dogs on Hale he does also the
amongst a one Talon de menor maldis good
all these good dogs that is actually I'm
so glad we bought that that is the
coolest thing well I would look good in
that flame that's portal goddess also we
always do I think it might be maybe
everything that is definitely a little
that is hazel Hayes Valley talking about
a lot of things so what I would we'll go
to Nashville and ask for soul I think we
also say Oh whoo wolf that microlight
one whoa hey didn't you get this bone
for Pinocchio oh he will Walter I would
walk to chew
that balls are so weird better enjoy
watching like what the heck oh yes
probably most of you were like what the
heck okay we got a bunch of pins pins
are new to us
we're like new B pin and we don't trade
them we just buy ones they like okay
that's all it is like yeah I'm losing
that I never wanted to get into it cuz
I'm like I don't want to trade pins like
I just wanna buy it didn't have it
something like 20 dollars like that is
not an exaggeration a lot of them you
can get low you know 7 a.m. but $11.99
12-minute I just like staying on for me
yeah but I do want to like buy you can
buy like cheap packs on like you know
eBay whatever I haven't looked into it
but you can buy like bulk packs it's
just like Randall ones and then you just
trade anyway but these are ones we want
to keep for real so I'm gonna show the
one I picked up just for myself first
this is like a Beauty and the Beast like
it's like a stained glass with the rose
rose and it was just so pretty I kept
seeing it like in every gift shop and I
was like that's the one cuz I always get
like one special you do to see yeah we
each got one like kind of like personal
yeah yes
oh shoot your special one my special pin
this time it says what in the world will
we do today and it's got like a spinner
on it's kind of hard to see but it's got
a spinner and it has the four park so
you spin it says what in the world
should we do today
blick which is nice because we with our
Annual Pass we have like the park hopper
option so there are some days that we're
like which projects we go yeah I like
which one so that is I think that's so
cool we also got because Pandora just
opened we also got one that says Navi
River journey and one that says flight
of passage which of the two new rides
flight of passage blew my socks off it's
so 83 freaking hours and it was worth
every minute it was it was so good and
there are like there are so few rights
that I would say that about well yeah oh
yeah I mean even like mine during mine
train is ugly but I wouldn't want to
wait three hours even for the very first
time I wouldn't was kind of crazy about
flight of passage of me I mean it's the
only time we've ever done it but I feel
like it was long I think we were there
for like ten minutes
like I didn't think you're like it was
done quickly oh like yeah so I think
that's part of the reason to like mine
Trant
you mean second six minute ride if that
so I feel it's like to invite a passion
where you say either way yep what
so this one I guess close in the dirt
didn't even realize that there's no
fancy dancy but I like it cuz work we
keep our pins in the dark so often but I
kind of like this new you know us
getting pins that are meaningful but
also getting ones like if it's a new
ride or like if the ride was closing we
didn't see any pins about those two
rides that were closing but it's kind of
a cool thing because then forever like
if these are open for a long time we can
look back and say oh yeah we bought that
the month it open well or the year and
open really yeah it's really cuz like my
mom had stuff like that like yeah where
she was like there when a certain ride
open you know in 1985 and I'm like
that's so cool so so we assumed our
future kids will be nerdily obsessed
with Disney - how could then they'll
think it's cool
or they'll hate it yeah because we'll
like really shove it in their face in
there hey so let's just pretend we hate
Disney and then they'll love it
especially when in teenagers we have so
got a pop century one cuz same reason
same reason mm-hm it's actually really
cool I love that like art pop art into
pop art it will set Art Deco no not my
inner and finally we got this one which
is the castle and it says 45 years
because it's a 45th 45 Faribault well I
didn't even realize I slid back into it
all the Tigers we do it is so much I
really messed up I didn't realize it was
45 years that's why they're doing
there's a lot of stuff that was just
announced at d23 this year and I think
it's because they're trying to get ready
for the 50th there's a five years gonna
fly by but there is a lot of new stuff
coming to Walt Disney World it's gonna
be amazing
there's so much stuff that's gonna be
closing and redoing I mean I can talk
about this for hours but I'm five years
from now Walt Disney world's gonna be
completely different place and it's
gonna be amazing they're gonna already
use amazing that already is amazing but
they're doing so much stuff it's gonna
be completely completely different oh I
can't wait okay so we got this also for
his mom
just cuz she loves bright colors and she
loves Disney as much as we do and it's
got a little Mickey there yeah oh yeah
it's another cutting board but not for
us um so Mickey they're bright happy and
then I just now realized that is they
Mickey - do you see that little slice
and the orange thing - the two years
anyway I didn't realize it but it's just
cute and it says Disney Parks on it and
she's gonna love it
ornament it's cute
we have another ceramic one like this
but it was like a disney movie club one
time I thought I always think is they
have like big you know the crystal ones
you know or the round ones and with the
glass ones I'm always like those are
gonna break when we travel so I always
I'm like let's get the thin metal one
that would travel really well that's
what I always think about no let's drive
at some point and then we go crazy
Sam oh my gosh buy a Christmas tree
there I don't know we just bought it
what absolutely
MBG also we found the tank screwdriver
did we show you that yeah that went with
my little magic tiny screwdriver yeah
there's a little screws back there
pretty cool but what's nice is if you
ever wanted to put it back in your the
wristband you could do that yeah on this
trip Jessica had on her red bag her
three little pins the shoes on said it's
like my three yeah so you can if you if
you watch the blogs you'll see him but
we were talking about you know neither
of us really want to wear lanyards
around the parks because good we don't
worry they want too hot it's hot and we
don't really want to have all that
weight and again we don't really want to
trade a lot of people in a trade fins we
just buy them because we like them we
want to keep them and say well what are
we gonna do cuz it doesn't really make
sense to get a lanyard and then just
hang up the lanyard so we were kind of
looking around and then we saw this
perfect perfect pin trading binder so it
comes I don't know many ten pages and
you put your pins in the pages ya know I
mean I've not felt what am I thinking of
like I'm fast to keep LTE yeah oh not
Philips at all it's like a plastic sheet
you can poke your pins through and have
them all together and so we even thought
about like you know if we bought a pin
now that they sell pens for the resorts
to like we could have a page all occator
to reserve one dedicated two years and
one dedicated to write rides if we
bonded oh yeah they have ride ones so
one dedicated to just characters
characters one the page that you buy you
know just the page page Pinocchio page
Andrew we haven't talked about Andrew
he's somebody else who would know where
to say I'm kidding I didn't make the
joke Mary heard that joke of my wife
Monica
they said I'm kidding we no no all right
brains connected oh my god oh cool I
didn't realize this oh sorry
that was way too funny to me
insert label here but that's kind of
cool so we could label like like if we
ever filled this up we could label the
years and then by noon I can't imagine
filling this up though conserve label
here but you can also buy refill pages
so that's pretty cool also though I'm
thinking we kind of write our thing on
the back of this just since it'll fit so
I'm excited and I love that it's like a
shiny pretty cheesy awesome you're gonna
go ham on this thing I can't wait to put
our pens in I mean so excited to do that
we waiting to film this so I can do it I
mean I could have done it before but
here's our sleepy puppy Pinocchio
got it show something we bought him but
not till says oh I wanted to show you
guys well fast I wanted to show you my
collar its boa cute it's got little
little Mickey's on it Waddell and pop
Wentz has blue um I like it a lot more
comfortable so while we can also show I
don't want to show the address oh it
didn't you do it he also got a little
like Mickey thing they're like little
kiosks you can okay yeah like a dog tag
engraving station so we got a little dog
tell you says hi my name is Tokyo and it
has our number of desks what Hale we got
a leash for him as well that matches
this we also got him a dog toys remember
this noise sure it's right in his dinner
he said oh I got go I got awful things

busy you're one of your flipped he's an
idiot what are you so cute I do off my
toy Dale he's not what's why um so we
also like last year got him one that's a
squeaky but it's plastic or like rubbery
plastic it's a Mickey ice cream bar it's
really cute last thing we got was this
tea
it's wonderland tea and we bought it for
your brother my brother-in-law Jason who
watches Pinocchio all the time and he
watched Pinocchio while we were gone and
he loves team so and actually
might know Jason if you watch the
Jason's journeys segment on kinda show
so we bought him some tea as just as one
of our thank yous to him because he
loves tea and there's all different
kinds there's pomegranate mango and he's
had this before this Wonderland he said
it's really good I don't think we've had
so we really like tea too but he said
he's had this before because my mom has
bought it in the Disney parks before and
he said it's pretty good so yeah so we
figured perfect there's all different
kinds so it's really fun yeah I forgot
one more thing
I can't believe ever got it it's this
Disney parks tumbler from Starbucks so
they have Starbucks then I think all of
the Disney parks and so I think you can
buy this at any of them I bought mine in
the Magic Kingdom however and I'm so
excited it's got this bent straw and it
you know it doesn't fall out or anything
like that but I love that it has these
little Disney parks like little logos
and characters and things like that on
the side and I've been eyeing it for
literally years so I'm so excited to
finally own it so that was everything
