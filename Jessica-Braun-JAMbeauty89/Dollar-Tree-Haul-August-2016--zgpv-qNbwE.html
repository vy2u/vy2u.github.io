a Dollar Tree haul yeah I have not done
one of these in a little bit I say that
every time but it always feels like it's
been a long time I actually bought this
stuff like a week or so ago but then I
was out of town for a bit so I'm
actually excited I got one two three
four five six seven items is that right
seven items and one of them is actually
a hair item so let's go ahead and get
into it why don't we start with hair
item cuz it's so darn cute this was new
say this was a dog everything was a
dollar this is I'm gonna open it a
little like elastic headband
and I just thought oh my gosh it's so
cute just to wrap her on your head and
just have right there is that not
adorable hold up cute right I mean it's
one sides longer so I think I need to
put it like on the other side but either
way I think that is so just fun cute and
it was a dollar so next thing okay most
of the stuff I got was from Fergie like
the Fergie collection if you will and um
there was a ton and I'm actually really
excited to try a lot of this stuff one
of them though I'm realizing I was going
through some old videos and I was like
wait a minute I've already reviewed that
the rest though I have not so we'll
start the one I already reviewed and I
did not like so I can tell you or annoy
them on good it's the Fergie velvet
matte lip color and this one is in the
shade pinky candy and what I didn't like
about these is that they're just so that
like they they were pretty pigmented but
they were so thin and it kind of felt
like a crayon and it didn't really stay
there was a little bit splotchy it's
just kind of one of those things that if
being in the Dollar Tree makes sense to
me cuz I'm like yeah like they shouldn't
sell well because I don't think they're
very good so that's that on these but I
did buy this one I am really excited
about this one wild shimmer take on the
day eyeshadow primer and it's called
it's in the shade a little party and
it's just kind of this glimmery
primer type thing what I like about this
is if I know like especially in the
evening if I'm going out and I'm
starting fresh like my makeup that'd be
an awesome way to start any eye look
there's some shimmer behind it and I
just think that's a cool idea I have
tried the regular take on the day primer
that she has and it was really really
good and I honestly just love the
packaging of this with like the rose
gold and stuff the next product I got is
from Wet n Wild and it's the Fergie turn
up the volume full blast mascara and
it's in the shade just can't get enough
which is super black apparently and
again really cute packaging this golden
packaging and the brush is kind of
really like it looks like it would be
clump crushing if you will you know what
I mean that it wouldn't allow for too
many clumps so I'll have to try this and
see but I will say they really stepped
up their game when it comes to packaging
I want to say they said to their game
with formula but honestly a lot of wet
and wild formulas really are good but I
love the packaging and all the Fergie
stuff I gotta stop talking about but I
love it so the next two items were also
from went wild Fergie and it's the on
edge long wearing eye pencils so I got
the one in midnight girl which is the
black and I also got one in the shade
violet femme which is the purple and
these seem nicely creamy I want to see
how well they stay throughout the day so
I'll have to test these out especially
like if you're using it in your
waterline or if you're using just a
tight line does it actually stay put
because with cheaper liners some of them
can be so ridiculously amazing like the
Jordana Danna like 24 hour whatever it
is
pencils those are incredible they really
do stay all day and they're also really
really cheap so I'm wondering if these
are gonna be similar to that where they
actually stay in place so I will have to
get back to you on that the last thing I
bought is Nivea cream now I want to ask
you guys how do you use Nivea cream I've
heard a lot of people will use it just
all over the place I mean you can just
use as a lotion on anything I've heard
some people use it just on their face
I've heard some people say they used on
their cuticles I've heard people say
they use it just like on their elbows
and knees I
I had a neighbor well my parents do that
I had been walking the pugs that they
have this was a couple years ago and he
told me that he put Nivea cream on his
dog's paws to keep them soft but I've
also heard you shouldn't do
and just thinking about our dog
Pinocchio he would lick it off and I
think that might make him sick so I I
don't know that I'm gonna try that but
I'm just curious I wanted to buy it
because it's always been such a classic
like even my mom my mom has always had
maybe a cream around and she just
randomly uses it for things so I'm gonna
talk to her but I'm curious about what
uses you use this for so let me know
down below that was everything I know
that wasn't a very long one if you're in
the mood for dollar tree halls check out
my Dollar Tree haul playlist I've done
quite a few and finding just tons of
like expensive drugstore makeup at the
Dollar Tree I found a lot of Physicians
Formula and those are like those can be
like ten to fifteen dollars at the
regular store and most of the stuff I
found was still at the regular store so
I was like what other than that I hope
you enjoyed and I'll catch you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
