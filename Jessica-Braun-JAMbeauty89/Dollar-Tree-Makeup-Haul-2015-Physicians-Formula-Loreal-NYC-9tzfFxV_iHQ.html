another Dollar Tree makeup haul for you
guys I've done one of these before on my
channel and I have a feeling it's
starting to become kind of a series of
mine because I go to the Dollar Tree all
the time as a teacher and I'm constantly
getting just all kinds of supplies that
I need for the classroom and so I always
find myself browsing the makeup aisle
and I always find tons of different
things even when I'm going just to the
same location every few weeks there's
always so many new products there so I'm
really excited to show them to you cuz
this might be my favorite one out of the
two I'll link my last Dollar Tree makeup
haul down below where I got a ton of
stuff but I think I like these things
even better so let's go ahead and get
started okay so one of the first things
I snatched was this Physicians Formula
shimmer strips custom eye enhancing
shadow and liner and this is in the
shade smokey hazel eyes now when I kept
the packaging I've already opened this
but I kept the packaging and slipped it
back in because when I took this out it
has nothing on it that says what it is
and furthermore like on the back you can
see the glue and when you like take the
lid off it just comes apart like it's
not like a flip top lid so I thought
that was kind of interesting so my only
guess is that Physicians Formula maybe
like saved like repackage these just for
Dollar Tree and like used whatever it is
originally in for a remade product or
something I don't know because I have a
feeling there's no way they actually
sold it this way but if you bought it at
a regular store and it did come like
this let me know because I'm just so
curious but regardless of the packaging
let's see how the actual shadows are
it's really hard to get specific shades
because some of these are really really
like thin stripes but I'll show you a
few of them they seem to be swatching
pretty well so here's kind of an up
close look at the swatches for this they
swatch pretty well they seem to be nice
and
are buttery again it's just hard to get
to some of the really small parts of
this palate where they're really thin
it's hard to get those individually okay
the next thing I got was also a
Physicians Formula product called their
retro glow mosaic powder and again the
packaging I saved even though I've open
this because when you take the actual
product out of here it is
there's no sticker or anything that
tells you what this is what brandon is
anything so this is in the shade
translucent glow it's just a speckled
powder that has just a little bit of
shower to it but no glitter or anything
which is nice I have a feeling that this
would work for someone like me that has
pretty fair skin but I think that if you
had darker skin I don't know I mean I
don't think this is like some amazing
product but it still does look kind of
nice I didn't wear it today I was trying
out some other products that I'm going
to review but the I've worn this once or
twice now and it does look nice and kind
of natural which I like so go figure
I've never even seen this I looked in
the stores to see if either one of these
are still sold in stores and of course
they're not but anyway okay moving
forward now on to the really exciting
things I got a ton of like lip colors
and lip glosses and things and I'm so
excited to show you these the first
thing I got were four different shades
of the NYC liquid lip shine lip glosses
and these are a dollar ninety-nine at
regular stores and they were $1.00 there
so it was kind of the same as getting it
like 50% off but the reason I was so
excited was not necessarily because it
was even cheaper which was great but
because I actually love this formula I
have the NYC liquid lip shine in
Brighton Beach peach I think it's is
what it's called and it's such a nice
formula it is so comfortable to wear I
actually keep it at school because I use
that's like what I wear everyday cuz I
can just throw it on and it's
comfortable it smells good I love the
way these smell the first shade I got is
called nude York City and it's just this
really pretty peachy nude color and
again they smell so nice
the next shade I got is called ribbing
tonneaus and this one is one of my
favorites because it does
a little more punch to the color but
it's still such a pretty metallic rosy
color that's so beautiful
the next one I got is called Midtown
mulberry and this one doesn't
necessarily have a metallic finish but
it has that a really good color and it's
just a glossy finish but nothing
shimmery or anything I really like this
one as well this would be beautiful in
the fall I think honey on the Hudson is
the last one I got of these and this one
is oh my gosh it's such a perfect brown
nude lip gloss that if you've been
looking for one this one is amazing what
I really like about these is the smell I
love how comfortable they are
the colors are all just so pretty and
across the board any shade you get
they're all that same consistency same
feel same look and I just love them so
even if you can't find these at the
Dollar Tree I would recommend these for
you know the full price of a dollar
ninety-nine anywhere else you can get
them they are a wonderful wonderful lip
gloss I was trying to think of a way to
describe the smell of these and I don't
know it's a sweet smell but it kind of
smells like coffee cake to me or
something like that
the next lip products that I got I was
really excited about because I always
eye these at the store and never buy
them because they're like five or six
dollars I'm like I don't really feel
like I don't know I just never felt like
buying them they are the l'oreal liqu
los lip glosses and the reason i've
always wanted to buy them honestly it's
because of the packaging they're so cute
but they're squeezy tubes which I don't
use all the time I do that's not true
actually the lip balms that I use all
the time are squeezy tubes anyway so
I've always Ida's and thought they were
so pretty but I never actually bought
them because they were like five or six
dollars so when I saw they were a dollar
I was like I am buying all of them they
had another one like a clear orange one
but that one I was like I'm probably not
gonna wear that so I didn't get it
although I'm thinking I might go back
and get it just to complete this little
collection here I don't know so I got
three shades now I know you're probably
thinking why would you buy these for
lips like a mint in a light purple they
don't go on your lips that color and
I'll show you what I mean in a second so
the first one I got is called florid
pink and it's just a nice sheer pink
color it does have a little bit of that
into it it doesn't pack a ton of color
punch though which I kind of like for
everyday the next one that I got is
called short shorts and it reminds me of
a really pretty Essie nail color and I
can't think of the name it kind of
reminds me of bikini so teeny and I love
that color but it is more of a sheer
wash of gloss there is a little tiny bit
of a tint to it but nothing that's
really detectable at all the last one of
these that I got is in mint ice and this
one does have more of a frosty finish to
it there's only a tiny bit of the mint
tint but not enough minton not enough
that it would really pick up but it does
have more of a frosty finish than that
lavender one did so if you were wanting
to add a frosty finish to your lip color
this might be a great option so the last
things I picked up are nail polishes I
found two of the Sally Hansen extreme
where hard as nails nail polish I used
to love these I mean they still sell
these in stores but some of them had
gotten kind of old so I gotten rid of
them over the past few years when I
decluttered like my whole decluttering
series I get I got rid of a ton of
different things this one is in the
shade perfect pairing and it's just a
really pretty kind of pear color I mean
it's a very appropriate little pun in
the title there because it's a really
light melon green but it's not like lime
green and it's definitely not mint it's
just right in between which i think is
so pretty as we go into spring and the
formula of these nail colors are really
nice they're always from what I remember
they were really opaque yeah very very
opaque and this one is no different but
they stayed on pretty well especially if
you've got a topcoat on top of it
I mean if you ask me I feel like when
you're buying nail polish you should
spend your money on a really good base
and top coat instead of a really
expensive nail polish because the base
and topcoat to me are what makes the
difference yeah the shake I got is more
of a white one and it's called pearl up
and as we get closer to spring I've
really been drawn towards like those
almost white different nail polish
colors that aren't necessarily why it's
so like a lavender white or a mint white
or even like a creamy white this one is
almost like a peach white color and
again it is really opaque and I'm just
so excited to give these a try because I
do love this formula the last thing I
pick
is this Revlon nail art mood candy nail
polish in these I feel I'm pretty sure
they still sell these but I had heard
pretty good things about the little
glitter top coats in these and this was
a really weird combo this was let's see
what it's called of course it doesn't
say with the action oh yeah it does well
this it says cosmic so I'm assuming this
duo is called cosmic but it's got this
kind of army green color which I'm not
really drawn to but I was really drawn
to this glitter topcoat so I figure
enough for a dollar if I only use one
half of it that would be fine but it's
just a really pretty like confetti like
glitter that's kind of a yellowish gold
with hints of like green and blue in
that and these work I want to say at the
drugstore they're still like seven or
eight dollars or maybe they're less I
don't know but I'm just excited to find
this for a dollar and give it a try
hopefully that was fun for you guys to
watch you should definitely go to your
nearby Dollar Tree and see what they've
got because I swear every Dollar Tree is
different and they all have such
different things every few weeks it's
all new if you're interested I just put
up a drugstore haul of a ton of new
makeup that are out just the regular
drugstore that I'm going to be trying
out here over the next few months I'll
put that link below if you're interested
and subscribe if you'd like and I'll
catch you as my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
