gonna be sharing with you a Dollar Tree
makeup haul it has been a while I swear
like for a while I was getting Dollar
Tree makeup deals like crazy and I was
doing like one a month and I can link
that entire playlist if you want to see
what I've gotten in the past but I feel
like the past few months every time I go
to the dama tree it's the same old stuff
and so I'm like man they were in a
groove for a while but I went the other
day and I was like oh my gosh here's a
bunch of amazing stuff for a dollar I
couldn't believe it
all name-brand stuff let's go and get
into it so the first thing that I was
like well what would was they had a ton
of the Milani béla eyes eye shadows
remember these when they were like huge
like literally a year ago it wasn't even
that long ago and everyone was like
getting the entire collection people
were going crazy over them they really
are nice eyes shadows they called them
gel powder eyeshadows because they kind
of have this consistency that's just a
look like really soft so it feels like
gel I bought one two three four five of
them trying to make sure I didn't forget
me they had I think maybe one or two
more colors at the one I was that but I
was it okay like these are the ones I
could see myself actually trying out so
let's just start tearing into these the
first one is this Bella charcoal and
it's one of their shimmers and it's just
this gorgeous like deep deep deep
charcoal color it is so beautiful and
these really are so smooth and they
blend pretty well from what I remember
and they just have a lot of pigmentation
the next one is in Bella silver and this
is a metallic the other one is the
shimmer this one's a metallic so this is
like a true oh my gosh a true silver and
it is very metallic I mean this is
insane and I feel like these were like 3
to 4 dollars at stores while they were
out and the thing is they're still out
so I'm like how what this next one is
Bella pink I love this one this is like
my exact favorite shade of pink so
like I gotta try this is this summit out
this is a shimmer oh my gosh and it's
just this gorgeous lilac frosty color oh
my gosh I love it
the next one is the best name family in
that purple family this one's a shimmer
and it's called Bella violet oh wow this
one is truly violet this one is not as
well it's still just as pigmented but
it's not as buttery like it's not as
smooth the rest were very like Hawaii if
you will but this one wasn't as much and
then the last one I picked up was Bella
cobalt and this is a satin matte it's
funny I would have called that violet
one - satin matte as well but they
didn't this one is so pretty if you like
blues look at that oh my gosh so very
impressed these are very high quality
really nice shadows the packaging is
absolutely gorgeous so I could believe
those are dollars so exactly kinda thing
and now they have like a kind of a
magenta red pink kind of color that I
kind of wish I would have picked up at a
while these are absolutely stunning so
the next thing I picked up with these
Physicians Formula eyeshadow things
these are they're wet and dry eye
shadows and it's a part of their baked
collection this one is baked souffle so
it's got like kind of this pyramid
packaging on it which is really cute and
then when you open it it's got a little
applicator in three colors and it's kind
of weird to get on there let's trend
like it's like literal pyramid shaped
eyeshadows kind of weird to swatch so
they kick up powder but there they are
they are these three so again you can
use them wet as well they'll be even
more pigmented these are the kinds of
eye shadow things my mom likes she
really likes Physicians Formula there
are channels really are nice and they
always blend gorgeously this is more
warm tone the one that was the bait
souffle this next one is called baked
sugar and it looks like it's more cool
tones so again the same exact packaging
so this reminds me of walking on
eggshells the wet-and-wild trio but
again really pigmented really pretty
certainly wearable colors I mean you can
get a complete look out of these which
are
really like and if you wanted a little
more punch you could certainly use some
wet like I said so I thought that is so
cool that these were $1.00 these were
probably like $10 regular price because
physician's formula is kind of pricey so
the next thing I picked up was something
I used to use a lot this is the Vaseline
lip therapy advanced healing this is
kind of one of those things that I put
on for like an hour while I'm getting
ready and then I'll kind of wipe off and
put something else on my lips for the
rest of the day so I just really liked
that and for a dollar I mean this is
probably ready to the price maybe two
dollars I don't know so the last few
things were elf so these were these are
really typically around the dollar
anyway but they were ones I'm like ooh
this is what I think I used to have but
I got rid of and it's one of their
smudge pots and pop and party and I've
done an entire video with swatches of
their smudge pots if you're curious
about other colors and you know how they
wear but I wanted to try this again
because it has been a while since I've
tried them and these deep colors like
this even if you don't like deep colors
like this I just said that twice they
can look really pretty underneath there
here it is right there it's a weird
place to swatch in Jessica weird it kind
of doesn't have that purple color like I
had hoped it kind of is just like a dark
wash maybe that's why it's at the Dollar
Tree so that's kind of disappointing and
the last thing okay I used to love this
this I used to use to like contour
bronze my face because I especially when
I have a little bit of color right now
but when I'm like super pale this is
perfect this is their clarifying pressed
powder and light beige and it actually
has salicylic acid in this infused in
the powder but I used a lot of this
stuff it comes with a little puff I've
never really used really simple
packaging but the color is what I loved
it's kind of this almost camel
um just watch it in a weird place again
oh well there it is kind of this really
light beige color and I that's the exact
name of the shade but I ended up loving
it it wears really nicely throughout the
day it's a really soft powder so I love
that kind of meshes well with my skin so
I'm gonna try this out again it's been
probably a year or two since I've used
it so hopefully this video was helpful
for you guys if you want to
my task Dollar Tree haul videos I will
link my playlist below I'm definitely
planning on doing more now that I found
a dollar tree that had some like fresh
stuff so I'm really excited I hope you
are too
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
