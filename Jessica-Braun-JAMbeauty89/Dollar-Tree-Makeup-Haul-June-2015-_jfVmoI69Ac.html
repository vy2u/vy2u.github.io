a Dollar Tree haul and I had done two of
these in the past I will link both of
them below there's so much fun you guys
love them those are some of my highest
viewed videos and I just love it
everything is a dollar and you guys know
I'm all about saving money here on my
channel most of what I own is drugstore
most of what I talk about here my
channel and what I review is drugstore
with a little bit of high-end sprinkled
in so this is right up my alley and I
went this time to get some things for my
wedding that's coming up some like
things for my throw away or my tossing
bouquet at the reception just I'm saving
tons of money buying a lot of cheap
things for the wedding they had a ton of
different makeup that I hadn't seen and
so the reason I can't do Dollar Tree
haul is more often is because you know a
month will pass and it's still the same
stuff at the dollar trees around me but
then every once in a while like every
it's almost like every other month
there's just like a totally new supply
of makeup so I'm very excited I've got
some Physicians Formula some NYC some
Milani and some la girl or LA Colors
whatever it is um everything is amazing
let's get into it so let's start with
the name-brand things because I know
that's what so I think people that have
never been to the Dollar Tree or that
just don't know don't realize that
there's so many like closed out um
makeup items that the Dollar Tree can
get ahold of you know however that works
but so there's a lot of really kind of
expensive products Physicians Formula
products are like they can be above $10
sometimes depending on the product so I
was really excited to see these there
now in the past when I've gotten
Physicians Formula they have been like
they had worn in their original
Physicians Formula packaging they had
like redone them so it's just like
really cheap no-name packaging and I was
so sad but this time it's like the
original stuff so this right here was
the first thing I grab it's their
shimmer strips custom eye enhancing
shadow and liner and it's the one that's
for smokey green eyes and you'll see
it's got the original packaging with
like the little purple whatever and a
little tiny button so let's go ahead and
now that
got this open swatch some of them just
to get an idea of kind of what Wow what
to expect with these oh my gosh look how
beautiful these are oh my gosh so this
is a total win and I'm so glad it's the
original packaging I know that sounds
shallow but I mean there's their
packaging is always so cute and I was
really sad the last time I got one but
that is incredibly pigmented so very
excited a dollar I cannot believe that
so the next Physicians Formula thing I
got was this Physicians Formula baked
collection wet dry eye shadow and this
is in the shade baked smokes and I know
that my mom likes these um
she's had a few they sell these I see
use of the Dollar Tree but I also see
these at Big Lots pretty often and this
is the packaging it comes and I'm almost
positive I mean it that it typically
comes in but it's just got these three
shades so let's swatch these of course
these big shadows are always more
pigmented when they are wet so those are
the big ones there these are really
pretty I almost feel like the other ones
are more pigmented than these are but
these are really pretty and of course
they would be more pigmented if you wore
them what and it does come with like a
little instead of yeah it's just to a
double-sided sponge applicator which can
be useful especially when you're doing
them what so that is pretty cool and
these are really nice wearable colors
alright so the next things I got I was
actually really excited about they are
these la colors color bombs and they're
just like I'm assuming the Baby Lips and
I got five of these one of them I uh I
already opened the packaging to one of
them cuz I just had to swatch but
where's the one that I already open
oh it's running away oh here's the one
I've already opened so I'm almost
thinking about doing like whole separate
review and swatch video on these because
I had no idea these existed and I know
there's so many people that love Baby
Lips but even though Baby Lips aren't
expensive if you can get the same thing
for a dollar then why wouldn't you so if
they're as good so this
is in the shade Kapow and it's like a
purple purplish pink I put this on my
lips earlier and it's almost too purpley
pink for me but some people would look
amazing if you had a darker skin tone
this would look amazing so the other
colors I got and I think I'll swatch
these in a separate video this is in
smooch and it looks like a light pink
this one is in boom and it looks more
like a fiery red I love the packaging on
these this one is in zap and this is
like looks like a bright pink doesn't it
then this one is in Wham and like all
the onomatopoeia it's kind of more of an
orange e-1 so lots of different color
choices I think I got all the ones that
were there they might have had one other
I don't know but very very excited about
those I will let me know if you if it
because no one's interested in a review
swatch video that I'm not going to waste
my time but if you are they also had
this Beauty Blender sponge not the same
rayon not Beauty Blender brand but it's
the brand sassy and chic and I'm dying
to know if it is any good because you
know I know I've tried so many different
dupes of the Beauty Blender and it's
never the same but I figured this does
feel a lot denser than a typical so this
is the typical Beauty Blender this is
this one so they're virtually the same
size but you really can feel the
difference this is a lot denser than
this and of course when it gets wet this
is when I use the other day it's still a
little moist it does grow this is not as
moist as it was but it grows pretty big
so I will try this out let you guys know
because if it if it's pretty close then
you can save a lot of money because
these Beauty blenders can be so
expensive I usually wait until there's a
deal like a pack of 2 or on Birchbox umm
I feel like I got a deal on Birchbox
once I don't remember anyway but very
expensive so if this works this is great
I actually bought my sister purple one
of these as well so I also picked up
I've still got Milani and so NYC &amp;amp; Spell
acknowledge these LA Colors cheek
products so there was this blush and
there was this bronzer and I am dying to
know if these are pigmented the
packaging looks like the covergirl ones
where it's
the powder product and then just like a
little you'd actually feel pretty well
made I have to admit they're like
thicker plastic than the covergirl ones
are so this color is and it just says
pink blush it looks I don't want to say
powdery because it's such a light color
that it's kind of like of course it's
powdery where is it there it is right
there can you see it it's a really
really light pink I'm gonna try it out
because when you're as fair as I am this
could either look really nice or totally
terrible so I will definitely try this
out I'm looking for my wedding for a
nice light pink I haven't found I've got
plenty of light Pink's but I just kind
of feel like I haven't found the one yet
so we'll see then the bronzer what shade
did they say this was in it shits in the
shade bronze while they're naming is
very clever so again the same packaging
this one is definitely a shimmery
bronzer very very shimmery in fact Wow
but really pigmented too it's really
pretty if you had the right skin tone
for that I'm certainly gonna try it I
probably wouldn't necessarily bronze my
whole face with this because it's so
shimmery but I you know maybe if I want
more of a bronzey shimmery look instead
of a blush during this summer that might
be a nice option and for a dollar you
cannot beat it and I'm surprised how
pigmented it is so I also got these
Milani glitzy what do they call glitzy
lip glosses so I had one of these before
that I actually got at the Dollar Tree
but the one I had before was like an
orange color and it just obviously
wasn't wearable now this is in the shade
lady light I like the name and oh these
are very very opaque and they're very
very glitzy and shimmery but it's more
of kind of a boo they smell
oh no they kind of have that melon or
whatever that smell is that um Milani
lip products have sometimes I'm not a
big fan of but it's very I don't know if
this would work with my skin tone I'll
certainly try it out because you never
know and it's so glitzy maybe you can
wear it in the center of your lips we'll
see but the other one I got is a little
more pinkish reddish
the only downside is you can't always
see the name said that not that it
matters at the store you can't always
see what they're called but I guess that
doesn't really matter this isn't the
shade all about me and yeah it does look
almost like ruby red whoa yeah that is
so pretty though like at the holiday cuz
this is one of those things that I
wouldn't wear this color very often but
man that would be absolutely beautiful
it's like a holiday party or something
so very excited I mean for a dollar come
on
I also picked up two of the no three of
these NYC lip products these are they're
a policies' glossy lip balms and they
actually had more shades than this but I
was like okay I gotta draw the line
somewhere they all have this little
apple shape in the middle which i think
is so cute and I've always is at the
store but I never buy them so I'm like I
don't really need it but when it was a
dollar I was like the so let's see now
these are just lip balms so yeah this is
not really a color this is in the shade
apple blossom they smell like apples oh
my gosh but you'll see it's just kind of
a sort of pinkish color that's kind of
nice though because I feel like a lot of
bombs like even the color bombs these
have so much color that for me if I'm
just wanting just a little bit of color
these are maybe a better option so this
next one is in the shade a policies'
pink and again it's got that cute little
Apple thing there oh this one does have
more color so I guess I spoke too soon
but that's a really nice pink color so
and again
it smells like apples it's a very I want
to say fake Apple smell but it's still
nice it's not so big that it kind of
makes you sick to your stomach
so the next one I got is in the shade
caramel apple and this one looks a lot
more of like a nude color yeah so this
one it's right in the center it doesn't
really have much color at all again that
yeah it has the same smell yeah I don't
like it got a little bit of a peach tint
to it but not enough that you even
notice I don't think but so I'm just
excited about these I think these would
just be fun in the fall when when I'm
wanting to smell lots of Apple II type
smells I think it would just be fun to
have in my purse and just use I don't
know I
love that I also got this pure silk rich
and luxurious shave cream I've bought
this I think I received this in an
influencer box once and I loved it and I
ended up buying it again for maybe two
or three dollars at the just like Target
or somewhere but then I saw they have
the same size same smell same brand at
the Dollar Tree I was like duh so it's
just you know you shake it up and it's a
it's a true cream that foams up really
big or a foam whatever you call it I
like this stuff I'm not really that
picky when it comes to shave cream but
it smells really nice this bottle that I
have right now I swear has lasted like
six months it's crazy and I used to get
like the EOS one and those are nice but
I would fly through that oh my gosh it
was like 329 and I would fly through it
within like I swear three weeks I'm like
I can't keep buying this so I was very
excited to find this it's pretty good
and it's so cheap I would love to know
what Dollar Tree finds that you have
found at your local Dollar Tree
