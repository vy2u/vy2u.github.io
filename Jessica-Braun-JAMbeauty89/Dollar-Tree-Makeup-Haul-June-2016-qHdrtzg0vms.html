Dollar Tree haul this is the most rapid
no the rapid is snow this is the
quickest I've ever been at doing another
Dollar Tree haul after my last Dollar
Tree haul so if you're curious about my
last one it was only a couple weeks ago
I will link it below I went to a
different dollar tree and found
different makeup so let's go ahead and
get into it so I was looking for some
different stuff this time one thing I
knew I needed was hair elastics and I
actually like this kind of has rubber
within the actual band so that it holds
on to your hair and doesn't move the
only thing I don't like about the rubber
is that it kind of everyone thought it
will grab one or two hairs and it'll
pull on them too tight and like almost
give me a straight-up headache like for
real so I'm going to try these out I
haven't tried this kind in a long time
so I'm curious arriving at it I
literally have like two hair ties left
and I'm like you see all this hair I'm
going to need some hair ties so awesome
another thing I found buy from
Maybelline is they're super away lip
color remover and this is a problem for
me personally because I do like lip
swatch videos and so you know if I put
on a really dark or really bright color
like what I'm wearing today and then I
need to remove it to put on like a nude
color it's really hard to get it off so
I'm curious to try this to see if it
actually works at removing them and
again for a dollar I was like yes Mabley
that is awesome
another product I picked up was the
sassy and chic white sanding block I use
this for my nails and I feel like I go
through these kinds of blocks like every
couple weeks so I'm like why am i
spending like two or three dollars on
them I could probably spend a dollar get
about the same thing so I'm going to try
it out and see if it's no good then I'll
just keep buying the ones I was buying
but I figured it's worth the try because
if it's only a dollar I could buy three
for the price that I was paying for the
original kind i buy so awesome I'm
excited to try that one I got a couple
of nail products this is the LA Colors
Art Deco nail art lacquer I used to buy
these when I was in high school to do
like nail art I don't know that I ever
actually did any but I always remember
owning like two or three at this exact
brand
this one's just in black because I want
to we're going
as you world very very soon again yes
because we love Disney and Tyler is now
a Disney world travel agent so I'm like
well of course we're going to go back
but this time we're taking my parents
but I know that I want to do some kind
of maybe like Minnie Mouse polka dot on
my nails so I figure I could do black
polka dots with like red and white I
don't know
so since I saw this there I was like you
know I'll spend a dollar and see if I
actually use it I got two brushes both
of them by wet and wild this one is
their eyes shadow brush so the brush fee
it's just black and it actually feels
really soft kind of like shader brush
for like maybe your lid whatever so I'm
curious the tries cuz I know I've heard
mixed things about wet wild brushes but
honestly I feel like a lot of people
have been leaning towards they're more
impressed with them than they thought so
I was excited to try this as well as the
next wet and wild brush this is their
large eye shadow brush and it's got kind
of a pink
well it's white and then I guess it's
got like an ergonomic like handle like
for your finger I don't know I guess so
it's kind of the same shape though to be
honest but this one's white with a
little bit of pink on the tip but they
really are like the exact same shape
exactly so oops
oh I'll use both I'm sure but they feel
soft so I'm excited to try them another
one world product i picked up was this
one wild lip liner in willow and it
looked like kind of like a praline type
color like a nude brownish tone yeah
that's exactly it I certainly do not
have a lip liner this color and I
thought you know that would be one I
wouldn't use often but for what I do and
be perfect to have just one I mean these
honestly are really pigmented decently
creamy once you get it going I think if
you just want one swipe it wouldn't be
but um it's a really pretty color so I'm
excited to give that a go I don't know
if this lip liner in Willow is available
just straight up at the regular stores
but if they are I mean they can't be
more than too much more than a dollar
probably maybe a dollar ninety-nine if
that another white wild product I used
to own this this is the wet wild wild
shine nail color and hallucinate and
this is one that I remember talking
about like in one of my earliest videos
what if I could find it I don't know but
I was talking about like tips of things
like I do I don't know but it was this
is a most it's such a pretty glitter
polish it's so easy to use it's so
evenly distributed and it's one of the
few I found like that and it's so
perfect what if you've got little chips
around the tips of your nail you just
cover all your nails and glitter you
won't be able to tell and that was one
of my tips I don't remember what the
video was but I love this exact one so
what I saw I was like perfect perfect
the last two things I got there were
these LA Colors shadows and I was just
curious to try them they actually have
like four or five different palettes but
these were the two that caught my eye
this one is in almost nude and it has
some pinks and some greens I know that
pink and green can look so beautiful
together so if you have like hazel or
greenish brown eyes like I do I was very
curious and try this so it's just got
the classic you know packaging swatch
some they seem soft let's see how they
actually swatch hmm can you even see you
they're pretty light let me try the
darker once and see this might be a dud
you guys that green looks kind of
promising that gets a little bit better
there's the green and like that kind of
brownish color so II it's alright I want
to try them on my eyes and see let me
swatch the next this one to the shade
Haute or hot but it's a che ute and this
one has some deep it has light and then
deep and it's got like some Brown some
purples and kind of some maroon or like
burgundy Ron Burgundy
this one seems to be a little bit more
pigmented so I don't know if that's
because it's so much darker or what but
even like the kind of lighter color was
decently pigmented so I don't know I'm
gonna try these out let you know it
might be worth trying because they it
seems to be like each shadows its own
thing where some are really good and
some are maybe so so but for a dollar I
mean you could buy for five dollars you
could buy all of them and
mix and match what's actually good so
that I'm you know I'm excited to try so
that was everything that I purchased
this time around please subscribe to
