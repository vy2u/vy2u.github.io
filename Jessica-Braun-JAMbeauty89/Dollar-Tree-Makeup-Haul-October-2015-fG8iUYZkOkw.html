share with you a recent Dollar Tree haul
I have done three of these on my channel
so far and it's all just Dollar Tree
makeup products that I found and they're
usually like Milani Physicians Formula
may believe there's just like all kinds
of drugstore brands where some of the
products like eight nine ten dollars
originally priced and they're of course
a dollar at the dollar tree cuz
everything there is a dollar the only
downside is it's so hit or miss so like
you might go one week and there's like
nothing and then a week later two weeks
later they've got you know some sort of
shipment in of just a ton of stuff you
know so it really is hit or miss but
what I found is that a lot of you guys
that have seen my idolatry videos have
been able to find a lot of the products
I show so I think they do kind of divvy
it up nationwide so a lot of the dollar
trees really do have a lot of the same
products so from what I've seen a lot of
the makeup at the Dollar Tree is maybe
discontinued or the shade was
discontinued you know whatever it is but
I have never gotten anything from there
that's been expired or you know weird
smelling or anything like that not yet
anyway not to say that that doesn't
happen cuz I don't know but I will say I
haven't had a bad experience with the
makeup that I've got so that is one
thing to keep in mind anyway enough
blabbering let's go ahead and get into
what I got okay so I've got my bag full
I have a lot of lip products this time
that I was really excited but let's
start with some of the other products
first so this I found this is the
Maybelline Color tattoo pure pigments 24
hour I get it's like a loose shadow and
it's in the shade buff and tough so
let's open this and see I remember
having I might even have this shade in
the past art I've got like lipstick all
over my hand I have this shade in the
past I think and I got rid of it um one
of the many times I be cluttered but I
wanted to see because it looks like a
really pretty color and I figure for a
dollar we're gonna
absolutely peel this off without getting
your number here there we go so it looks
like let me kind of get some air to live
here certainly like a bronzy golden
loose powder so I got a little bit let's
see oh it's definitely glittery oh it's
like really glittery like me it's like
only glitter I don't know I am just for
seeing this having so much fallout
unless you use an amazing amazing primer
that's meant for glitter I mean it is
beautiful though I'm like really
beautiful but it's mostly glitter so
keep that in mind if you know you don't
like that or you're scared that there'd
be fallout maybe stay away but this is
the only shade I saw there I would bet
they have other ones out and about but
it's nice but something to keep in mind
okay
next thing I hadn't seen that sounds
like how old is this but this is the
L'Oreal Paris shimmer of hope all over
loose powder and I was so intrigued
because I thought I've never seen this
in stores so like is it so old or maybe
I don't know I had a million questions
but let's go ahead and open it I think
it's like a highlighting powder but it
says all over and I'm like mm I don't
know if you want all-over shimmer powder
some people might yeah it's definitely
shimmery it's kind of a similar color to
that other one this would be beautiful
if you have a deeper skin tone as like a
beautiful golden highlight I might try
it regardless but it is a little deeper
than I would typically get but it comes
with a ton so if you find it I mean give
it a try because if this is I mean it's
kind of like a rose gold highlighter in
a way yeah more bronze eagle really
pretty so that was an interesting fine I
also found this elf product which that's
not surprising because a lot of the
products are a dollar anyway but this is
their mineral eyeshadow primer and I
think their mineral products can range
to be a little more expensive so I
wanted to try it and it's just in kind
of their cloud
like packaging or their eye primers it's
a doe foot applicator and it's just kind
of this beige color let's see yeah and
it just kind of blends in it has kind of
that silicone feel to it in a way no
totally though has a nice feel to it so
I will definitely try this out and let
you go because I am pretty sure this is
still a product they're selling it just
happened to be there at that time so
awesome now into I got a ton of Milani
lip products I'm so excited to roll up
my sleeves pull my hair in my face so I
got two of their power lip things now
this is so funny because I was I had
checked my few boxes I was opening some
of some things that subscribers sent one
of my subscribers sent me some of these
and I left because I thought oh my gosh
I just got some of them so that was kind
of cool so this is in the shade creamy
cafe I am so excited now what are the
claims on this it says it's a two-in-one
gloss and stain it's a twist pen with
the built-in brush so intrigued but I
love what if it what was it called again
creamy cafe so yeah it's it's like a
short little chunky thing and it's got a
little lip brush so you twist it until
this is making me think of like the
Stila lip glazes where you twist it up
into the brush I don't love that format
this kind of looks like what I'm wearing
on my lips today oh my my my my oh my
gosh I got way too much out it's like
half the thing it looks a lot like what
I'm wearing today you know what this
reminds me of which I am wearing today
the cielo I have it out cuz I was just
talking about it in another video I film
this is the Stila stay all day liquid
lipstick in patina oh my gosh which is
one of my favorite products I dries to
like this matte look I love it but this
is like over $20 so this is the Stila
patina one and this is this Milani
creamy cafe one they are so similar both
the consistency but the seal alone will
dry matte this one I don't think will
and this one's a little bit warmer like
you know not as pinkish as the patina
but these are both so beautiful oh my
gosh this is
I was wondering if it had like a cent or
anything so that's pretty cool let's
open the other shade now I'm really
excited this one's in raspberry tart and
this is the one I was super excited to
get now I'm gonna be careful and watch
myself actually screw it up not screw it
up I mean literally screw it up okay
okay there we go
uh-huh this one just looks like a deeper
version of patina oh my gosh these are
so beautiful how have I never heard of
thee actually it looks a lot like patina
well so again beautiful these are so
pigmented
there's not really a smell that I can
smell but um I cannot believe these have
been around and I haven't known about
them like I'm kind of mad this is an
amazing now I want to go back and see if
they have any other shades because but
okay so the next thing I got three of
their lip intense liquid colors so let's
see this one is in the shade red extreme
so the packaging as usual for Milani is
beautiful but it's a twist opposite a
doe foot yes it is a doe foot one let me
get like one more good okay so these are
super opaque and a thin layer is I mean
so opaque and it looks like it's kind of
more of a matte finish so again it
reminds me of the Stila stay all day
liquid lipsticks this is absolutely
gorgeous I can't wait to open the other
two let's do it so the next one's like
this purplish one and it's in the shade
violet at it this might be one of my
best trips there because I didn't get as
much as I always do but the things I did
get there are I mean unbelievable oh wow
this okay so this truly is like a bright
I'm trying to get a big enough swatch
for you to see bright purple you know oh
man it's so pretty now this one's not as
opaque right off the bat I mean it's
still pretty opaque but you can see
through a little bit so let's try
another layer
like on top and see if that yeah that
kind of helped it's a really pretty
color but it might be too bright for me
like in real life but you know in my
fake life I'm YouTube not kidding but I
don't really though when I'm filming
this would be I think a good color would
certainly try it out but very cool and
the last shade is fiery coral I don't
wear a lot of corals on my lips and I
don't really know why I don't I don't
think I look bad bad but I don't always
love the way it looks so we'll see about
this one Wow these really are intense as
they say this is almost like neon in
person it never comes across and say oh
yeah it does yeah that's like neon coral
that's pretty incredible though if you
know you like bold lips then you would
love any of these I wonder if they had
any of any other shades of this as well
because I would love a more neutral
shade but that's still really pigmented
like these are this is amazing these
these power lip ones are I think I like
these even more I see I can't decide
because I like that these are more
satiny matte but I love the color payoff
on those and the shades so that was
everything I got at the Dollar Tree this
time around I'll link my Dollar Tree
