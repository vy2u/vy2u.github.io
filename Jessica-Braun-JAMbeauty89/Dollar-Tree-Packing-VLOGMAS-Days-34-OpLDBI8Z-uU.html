ridiculous I would love that this pomp
anyway okay so um I was just remembering
and I wanted to see if you guys remember
I forgot that I do my jammy Awards and
that that would be coming up in a few
weeks I usually do it right at the
beginning of the year January and I
think I'll be getting back from London
right then so I'm definitely gonna do
them and it's basically just my favorite
so like my favorite lipstick of the year
my favorite lip gloss of the year etc so
I'm so excited to do that again
especially now that I've got even more
of you guys out there that watch me I'm
so excited and what was the real reason
oh so I'm trying out today I've been
using it for a week now actually I think
it's been more than a week Scandinavia
it's this makeup primer spray and this
makeup finishing spray I'm thinking
about doing a video with Scandinavia
like in collaboration but I told them I
want to try these out for a while see if
I like them coz I tried the finishing
spray in the past and I loved it but
I've never done the primer i've been
using the primer spray lately and i
actually really like it because right
now my skin is really dry even my lips
are dry but just because it's winter and
it's really helping my skin not feel as
dry because I don't mind having that
little bit of shine I just feel like it
makes me look like I'm alive of course
I've got a breakout that I've been
dealing with for like three weeks anyway
so so far I've been liking it but I'm
trying it out with some tinted
moisturizers I'm trying it out with
foundations just to see how it does with
different things today I'm using it with
a well I think it's a foundation it's
this Tarte Beyond BB foundation so it
says it's a foundation but it's weird
that it has BB in them anyway so that's
kind of an in-between for me but I've
tried it out with this
dr. jar and it's really really nice with
that I've tried it with this Neutrogena
Healthy Skin that I'm trying out and
it's nice with that too so I'm gonna try
it with some of my heavier foundations
as well just to kind of get like my
makeup forever I need to try it with
this maybe tomorrow anyway so I'll let
you guys know throughout the day how I
think it's doing with it
so if you have been around since we went
to Disney World for our honeymoon this
is one of the soaps we bought at the
place there called basin at Downtown
Disney or Disney springs now and it was
one of the Christmassy ones so I just
opened that the other day and then I
found this just at the drugstore at
Meijer this cute little snowman
peppermint and soap and then this Santa
my mama got me it's actually supposed to
hold a tea light so I need to put one in
there and then over here I just have a I
got that at Kohl's this holiday cookies
candle and then Tyler had that
decoration so I come home every day for
lunch cuz I work a mile down the road
and I come home and let this little dude
out and we go on a little walk hi buddy
you sleepy oh boy oh boy oh boy get out
so we're about to go on a walk it won't
be very long though it's so cold I don't
do well in the cold
thank you thank you all right we're
gonna go so school is over and I'm gonna
go to the Dollar Tree just to get a
couple things I need I have bought so
many really nice staplers and all of
them have ended up broken so I think I
finally learned my lesson that no matter
how much I spend on the stapler and no
matter what the brand is it will break
so I'm gonna just go buy a bunch of
cheap ones because I'm tired of spending
my money over and over again I'm gonna
learn my lesson cuz I figure I could
spend $20.00 and buy 20 staplers and
they might break but at least I'm not
spending $20 on one stapler and then it
breaks after a month anyway so we'll see
I don't know how many I get but I'm
gonna buy a couple but or maybe I'll buy
a nice one for me and just a bunch of
cruddy ones for my students to use
because I'm tired of mine breaking any
oh wow I was a lot of talk about
staplers so I'm gonna go to the Dollar
Tree and I'm also gonna look
make up is there since I love like
finding fun deals for makeup they're so
cool I wanted to check in that primer
spray and the setting spray actually I
think how long am I make it pretty well
my nose always gets red like I could use
the best foundation in the universe and
my nose still gets red and I don't know
if it's because I'm Irish is that a
thing that that I don't know that that
happens if you're I don't know anyway
it's a huge generalization anyway but I
think it held up pretty well so I'm
excited to try it with other products
like I mentioned this morning but I was
like okay okay okay usually my skin just
looks dry by now especially like I'm in
harsh lighting all day and so like I'll
go to the bathroom and I'll look in the
mirror and be like my skin always looks
so dry and just gross I don't know but
today I looked in the mirror in the same
bathroom I'm always in and I'm like okay
like it actually does not look dry so
that's a big deal so I'm excited to keep
using this oh my gosh these are so cute
I'm like in love with all of them too
bad I give them away
well I always end up in the schools of
piyo and end up buying way too many
supplies for school every time this
election is not good today
I am leaving the dollar tree with no
stapler but I don't want to stop at
another store I need to stop a goodwill
to drop off stuff for real this time
and then I'm just too tired and hungry
so I need to go home and I'm sure
Pinocchio needs to go out so I'm just
gonna get a stapler another day so I'm
currently having some of this holiday
blend from Starbucks and I put hot
chocolate powder in it and it makes like
a little mocha latte kind of like
wannabe it's not good for you but it's
absolutely delicious
so just kidding me in the holiday spirit
I love it this is what it ends up
looking like it's so I mean it's it's
almost hot chocolate but it just has a
little bit of that coffee so it's really
I really like doing that when I'm just
in the mood for that but I need kind of
a kick in the face like a little bit of
caffeine I mean also I wanted to show
you this cute tray it's like um made of
I don't know what but it's like not
metal but something like strong and I
thought it was so cute and it's gonna be
perfect to just throw like my earrings
on or whatever before like most of the
time I'll go a couple days before I
actually put my jewelry away so for me
this is such a great little catch-all to
put you know my watch or my bracelet
whatever so I was excited by this fun I
just thought was cute and then I got
some candles for this holder we have and
then really I just got random things
like some gift wrap we we never have
birthday wrapping stuff so I got some of
that and then I just got again more like
birthday and some baby shower things
I've got a baby shower coming up for a
co-worker things like that and of course
I have to show these adorable Christmas
bags at the Dollar Tree I feel like in
past years they've always had like
really cheesy gift bags that weren't
really I don't know like nice and I was
so impressed with how nice these are
especially this one so I was excited
about that so I just cleaned my brushes
and I used I don't know if I've ever
shown it this dr. Bronner's magic soap
and you just mix like this is lasting a
year
probably two years um you just mix some
of this with some water and I just used
this little cinema secrets tin I think I
bought on Sephora's website for this
purpose and I just leave it empty when
I'm not washing them but and then I just
clean my brushes and I actually I need
to get these position right so they
could dry better but I've been so much
better about cleaning them more often I
feel like I was so bad and I would have
so many brushes dirty but I got rid of a
lot decluttered a bunch so I'm left with
only my favorites and so I'm a more
likely to clean him that way and be not
as overwhelmed with so many so that's
good good morning boys and girls it's
Friday and it's breakfast time
jessica's any other room getting ready
so I'm making us a little breakfast got
some scrambled eggs and I know I know
