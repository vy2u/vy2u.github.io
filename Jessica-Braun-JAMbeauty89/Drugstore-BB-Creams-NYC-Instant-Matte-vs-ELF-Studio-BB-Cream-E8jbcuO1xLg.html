to do a quick review of two different BB
creams and kind of comparing them
side-by-side to see which one is better
they're both really inexpensive which is
why I paired them together because I
figured that makes more sense to pair
products that are closer in price
together and see which one's better than
you know comparing a really expensive
one to a cheaper one so I am comparing
today the NYC smooth skin BB cream five
and one instant matte BB cream with the
elf BB cream from their studio line with
an SPF of 20 the NYC BB cream retails
for around 3 or 4 dollars at Walmart I
find mine out of the store called Meijer
so you can you can also order it online
but it's really really inexpensive but
they only have a couple color options
the elf BB cream has a few more color
options but it retails for six dollars
on elfs website I don't know that I've
seen this particular product in stores
but I know target sells elf some
Walmart's now carry elf so you could
look for it but online you almost get
better deals because you can get a bunch
of things and there they sell a lot more
online and you can always get free
shipping they always they have 20% off
sales all the time things like that so
you can certainly find this for a lot
cheaper sometimes they'll have their
studio 50% off in which case these would
both be around three dollars so before I
show you my first impressions of me
applying it I applied the NYC BB cream
to this side of my face today and that's
what I'm wearing and I applied the elf
to this side of my face they do perform
differently than each other so let's go
ahead and get into my application of it
kind of my first impressions okay so I'm
going to apply the NYC one to this side
of my face
and I'm going to apply the elf one to
this side of my face and we're just
going to see kind of the differences in
coverage and the way that it feels and
all that good stuff and the way that it
looks of course because that's the other
part of it so let's go ahead and start
I'm going to apply both of them with my
hands because a BB cream to me since
it's not a foundation it's not meant to
be really thick it in my opinion is best
applied with your hands and I think
that's the idea behind it because it's
just something that it's like a tinted
moisturizer but it's got added skin
benefits so that is why I'm applying
them with my hands so in the NYC one i'm
using the color zero one light i don't
know
yet if these match my skin I've kind of
swatched them and they seem to so we're
just going to see how it looks um all
right
it looks really um light but kind of in
a good way because well look how fair I
am you know
it certainly is toning down my skin tone
like making it look a little more fair
in a way so it might be too light for me
kind of looks gray do you guys see that
doesn't it make my skin look a little
bit gray and keeping in mind that I've
got you know a little bit of
hyperpigmentation and also freckles
there that I would you know I would love
to color to cover some of the
hyperpigmentation it's very easy to
blend in so that is nice it does feel
thin in a nice way it feels like I'm
just putting on a moisturizer it feels
exactly like my moisturizer does but a
little thinner so just to kind of put on
the rest of it there so this is
essentially one layer of it blended with
my hands and blend it back into my
hairline and I think the main thing I'm
noticing is just that it does look a
little bit gray on my skin it didn't
really cover a ton but my skin in my
opinion my skin does look better than it
did without it it did have a little bit
of coverage but not a ton so let's go
ahead and try sorry and I know there's
stuff on my hand I wrote myself a note
to remind myself at school because I'm a
teacher and that's why I tried to get it
off and I can't get it off I should not
have used that marker anyway it doesn't
matter
so the elf BB cream I will say packaging
wise I love that this has a pump so
that's really really nice this one I
have in the shade oh no it does not say
or you can go there it is in fair it's
probably the lightest shade they have
but you just pump it ooh when I left
Sean across the room this one looks a
little bit darker than the other one did
I think yeah it is a little bit darker
this one has that SPF smell as well whoo
big time hmm this one is a little bit
thicker so if you like a thicker
consistency then you might like this but
it certainly is thicker and a little
darker than my skin but not necessarily
in a bad way yet it kind of is blending
in to it in a nice way
okay so I'm thinking as I'm looking at
myself and it's hard to see because for
me I'm used to seeing myself with a full
face of makeup so but just looking at my
skin I feel that the elf had just a
little bit higher coverage so I think
that if you do want a little more
coverage it's not super high coverage
because a non foundation you know and
that's the thing to keep in mind I think
a lot of people and it's for me too
I've struggled to find a BB cream I love
because I always want everything to be
covered but that's not quite the idea
and there are BB creams out there that
have a lot higher coverage but usually
they're a lot more expensive but for
this for a BB cream I think that the the
NYC one is not as greasy so if you're if
you tend to get really greasy and oily
throughout the day I would say the NYC
one is just a little bit less oily
whereas the BB cream from elf you can
see there's a little more oil deposits
on my skin here versus here I feel like
it still lets your skin breathe but it's
not quite it's more of a matte finish
really so if you struggled with BB
Creams because they make you look oily I
would go with the NYC in that case but
the elf I still kind of like the way it
makes my skin look and I think in the
summertime this is going to be a great
one just because it it's got that SPF
and it's only SPF 20 I'm gonna put the
rest of this on because it was on the
cap but I just I like it and this I
should have pointed out the NYC does say
instant matte so it is more mattifying
but it's not as high coverage so
obviously going through kind of the pros
and cons of each the NYC the packaging I
think the packaging itself is cute and I
like that it's not like in a jar or any
or like glass jar or anything I like
that you can squeeze it out however
comparing this packaging to the elf one
I love that the elf has a pump I mean
anything with the pump just makes it
easier you can really control how much
comes out of the pump to which I think
is important because most pumps you can
so packaging wiser the elf would win of
course price wise on a regular basis the
mo I see is a little bit cheaper however
color range wise elf has a few more
colors they both blend into the skin
really well a lot of the drugstore BB
creams have tried even the lightest
shade either oxidized on my face weird
and looks orange or it's just instantly
too dark for me so I was Pleasant
surprised to find two different
companies that sell a shade that for
someone that's fair actually works so I
was very excited about that the NYC one
is a little bit thinner the BB cream
from ELF is a lot not a lot but a little
bit thicker and their finish I feel that
the NYC one it says that it's instant
matte it really does mattify whereas the
elf one you can see is a little bit
shows a little bit more by oil I don't
want to say either one of these are oily
because honestly I have been pleasantly
surprised you know going throughout my
day I've just been doing things around
the house clearly I'm just kind of
comfortable today that it's held up it
still looks the same way that I applied
it which I am thoroughly surprised now I
do it is kind of bother me looking in
the mirror here I know I keep looking at
it just it does bother me seeing this
much oil come through you can throw the
Rimmel stay matte powder which is my
favorite just throw that just in your
tees own and be good to go and I feel
that I'm just impressed with both of
these so I think really the fact of the
matter is if you're trying to decide
which one of these they're both really
good drugstore options neither one of
them are crazy high coverage but if you
want a more matte option I would go with
my C if you you're not concerned about
that go with the elf this is something
amazing that if you just want a little
bit on your face just you know you're
going up to the store and you don't want
to do a full face makeup but you do want
to look a little more put together it's
perfect or if you're in a Russian you
don't want to get a Beauty Blender wet
and do all that or you don't want to use
a brush it's just a quick go-to and I'm
so excited because I feel like I've been
searching for drugstore BB creams that
are good and I think both of these are I
think if I had to pick one I would go
with the elf BB cream just because it I
like the packaging more I feel like it's
a little higher coverage the only con is
just that I probably would set it with a
powder I mean that's one extra stuff
that takes ten seconds so it's not like
it's that big of a deal but I would
recommend this I think the most and
especially since I think color wise you
get you have more options other than
that they're both really good so if you
do want the matte I know I've said this
10 times but if you want the matte I
would not go for this I would go for the
NYC but they're both really good
products so I hope that review was
helpful for you guys I feel like I
repeated a lot of the same things but I
want
get across to you exactly how I feel
about these I think they're both great
and if you're interested in more drug
store reviews I have a ton I can link my
playlist below of a lot of the new lines
