going to share with you guys my
drugstore foundation collection but it's
not just to show you the foundation I
have I want this video to be a
collection of full-on reviews of all of
these foundations I've tried all of them
enough to at least have a good feel for
my thoughts on them who I would
recommend it for or if I just wouldn't
recommend it at all
before we get into it make sure that you
subscribe if you'd like to see more
drugstore makeup videos and I hope that
you will also come say hi on my social
media and let's go and get into the
video
so the first foundation I wanted to
start with is the wet and wild photo
focus foundation so in my collection I
have three different shades took me a
while to finally get the one that I
needed but they have 20 shades in the
range and this retails for $5.99 of
course you can get coupons and sales and
things from time to time but I've got
show ivory nude ivory and soft beige he
claims of this foundation is that it
gives pretty good coverage but also that
there's absolutely no flashback and I
will agree with the fact that it doesn't
give any flashback if you use flash
photography anything like that the
packaging of these is a little bit
interesting it's one step better than
just a straight-up open glass container
with a lid
you just have to dump it out because it
has this little paddle that you can kind
of swipe either on to your brush your
Beauty Blender your hand whatever or
your face so it is a step above that but
it's certainly not my favorite kind of
Foundation packaging of course for them
to keep the price down on this I'm sure
a pump would have been a little bit more
expensive it would have made the price
kind of creep up that's my inference or
my guess but soft beige is a little bit
too deep for me so I've been using kind
of these lighter ones or kind of mixing
them as well I again really haven't
found the perfect shade but because
these are inexpensive I don't feel too
bad buying a couple so I feel like the
coverage on this is medium I think you
can build it a little bit I always like
the way my skin looks with it at first
like the first half of the day but I do
feel like about halfway through the day
starts to break down around my nose a
little bit and so I'll grab like a
powder
nation and just kind of touch-up but
it's nothing that looks so horrible that
I'm like not wanting to wear I still
wear it all the time I'm reaching for
these a lot more often than some other
foundations so I think that's a
testament to how these perform I do
think they wear pretty well certainly
not perfect so I think for 5.99 it's a
great option it's one that if I ran out
of it I probably would buy it again just
so I would have it my collection I like
it so the next foundation is one that I
kind of go back and forth with it's the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi I bought this a
couple different times and decluttered
it over and over again because I never
really liked the way my skin looked with
it I have dry skin I would say normal to
dry and this should be perfect for my
skin type right and I like a glowy look
to the skin it just never works for me
now as I'm reading the claims it has 12
different shades that retails for 1295
you can often find it for like $8.99 at
Target in places like that but that's
kind of the retail value it says it's
medium coverage its skin improving and
then it's got a luminous finish so it
has ingredients like vitamin C and E
things like that that are supposed to
help your skin over time if you're
wearing it everyday which i think is
amazing and I didn't know that about
this the first few rounds of trying this
out so I think that's pretty cool it has
40% pure water and of course it gives
you this instant luminous glow I will
agree that it's certainly not a matte
finish by any means I just wish it had
more coverage I think that's usually
what it is for me I haven't found a way
that I like applying this now knowing
that it does have a little bit of better
ingredients in it does make me want to
try it a couple more times because that
means it's a great option for maybe a
day that I don't need a perfect skin
look but I don't want to be putting
things on my skin maybe on a Saturday if
I'm grocery shopping I maybe throw this
on instead of a BB cream because I feel
like the coverage of this is like that
of a BB cream if that makes sense so the
packaging is beautiful if you like maybe
a lighter coverage a little bit glowy
and good for your skin and I think you
like it so kind of meant for me the next
one is the Neutrogena hydro boost
hydrating tint this one retails for
$14.99 it has ten different shades the
packaging is what sold me on this
it has a huge doe foot applicator
similar to like the Clinique beyond
perfect one so you can just kind of
swipe it onto your face where you want
and then blend it in this is not a high
coverage foundation at all it really is
more of like a tinted moisturizer kind
of a look however it has hyaluronic acid
in it and it's supposed to make your
skin kind of plump apply you know just a
little bit more plump I do feel like
when I'm putting this on I feel like my
skin is happy and I don't it certainly
doesn't cover like redness that I want
it to cover but every time I apply it I
feel like my skin is like because my
skin loves hyaluronic acid when I do it
in serums anything like that my skin
loves it so for me I like it for that
reason alone this is a great weekend
foundation for me I wear it to work from
time to time if I'm in a rush because I
know I can blend in really quickly but
if I'm wanting a flawless look this is
not what I'm going for some people it
compares it to the LA mayor Foundation
and they said they really it's very
similar to that I think that's pretty
cool I don't know I haven't tried the
lemare foundation maybe one day it's so
expensive I don't know but I don't know
about that but I do know that I like
this again not for full coverage so that
that is my those are my thoughts on this
my next favorite favorite favorite is
the elf flawless finish foundation this
is oil-free it has SPF of 15 it retails
for $6.95 the shade I am in it works
pretty well for me this is a full
coverage foundation it has a pump which
I love I mean it's very nice packaging
for a six dollar foundation it's kind of
crazy when I start to compare the wet
and wild to this I do think the elf one
is leaps and bounds above it when it
comes to the finish and the longevity of
it and the packaging so that's something
to keep them up keep in mind now
oftentimes in stores you can't see as
wide of a shade range in this but online
you can access all of them
this has SPF of 15 like I try which is
pretty cool I just love the coverage in
the finish it's a semi matte finish full
coverage I think you need to build it up
but it's definitely full coverage I'm
wearing it today I had to think wait
what did I put on this is what I'm
wearing today I usually use a blender
with it a sponge of some kind today I
used the Eco tools one and I was very
impressed with the Eco tools sponge but
I really like it I don't know what else
to say it's one of my favorite
foundations above high end I still whoo
I still am reaching for this foundation
all the time so my next one is the
Rimmel lasting finish foundation this is
only in seven shades and at least it
target its retail for $6.99 it's a
little bit more expensive depending on
where you get it but this is one that I
used to own and then I had gotten old
and so I repurchase it recently I have
it in the shade 100 ivory which is a
pretty good match a little deeper than
you think but it's a good match for me
anyway the packaging is not great it's
just the old glass dull bottle but I
mean I really hit that you can buy pumps
online from like random brands that
would fit this regardless it's supposed
to last for 25 hours it's one of those
long wear foundations you can totally
build it up to full coverage I love this
foundation it's one of the first
drugstore foundations I ever tried and
that's that made me realize that you
could get amazing foundations from the
drugstore I mean this is beautiful it
wears all day long really no matter what
primer I've tried it with it looks
beautiful I do think it's best applied
with a sponge because it is full
coverage even with a sponge it's full
coverage I love it it does have a smell
that kind of it's a very specific smell
that I attribute to this and it for me
it's like nostalgic because this is one
of my first favorites so when I smell in
like makes me think of what I was doing
I was like a nanny at the time and like
starting my channel anyway I love this
foundation I totally recommend it again
really cheap I think I like this better
than the wet and wild one too
I'm starting to realize a lot of these
are around the same price and yet
they're just a little bit fun Henner
but I love it speaking of full coverage
by the way the Rimmel and the elf both
look really nice even if you have dry
skin so even though I'm say
yes they cover really well it doesn't
cover so much that you end up looking
dry and cakey it doesn't accentuate that
at all and that's why they're amazing my
next one is from elf it's their
foundation serum from their beautifully
bare line this is $8 there's only three
shades this is not how do I wear this I
didn't like this for my skin but when I
had mentioned that a video a lot of you
guys said no it really is amazing you
just got out of the right skin type for
it's a very very thin lightweight
formula that's their gimmick is that it
really is more like a serum and serums
are you know liquid it's only three
shades I think because it's not meant to
be like a full coverage trying to think
it's supposed to kind of blend into your
the pigment of your own skin and so you
try to get something close there
definitely is a color to it there's no
way there's no getting around that but
when I put it on it's just every dry
patch I had it just rubbed through and
it just accentuated that and then any
redness I could just see lines whether I
was using a brush my finger a blender it
didn't matter you could just see where
you'd blended where you got it's like I
couldn't get it blended into the skin it
just looks so weird on my skin and I
don't know I tried it a couple different
ways and every time I try it on I just
don't like it but a lot of other people
love it so I think maybe if you've just
got really perfect skin or I'm wondering
how it might look on more mature skin it
could either look really nice or really
bad I don't know it just wasn't my
favorite I thought I liked the packaging
the pump is great but beyond that I just
it didn't work for me my next one is one
that's a little bit newer to me it's the
Maybelline fit me foundation but it's
the dewy and smooth one so they have
like the regular fit me which I think is
now the matte and poreless and then this
one's to do in smooth or I remember that
the regular fit me foundation became
either matte and poreless or dewy and
smooth and then there's I don't know
regardless this is the one I have right
now and it has SPF of 18 so it has a
little bit of protection again it's just
got that dumb glass dump bottle it is
what it is but I had to shade 120 great
match for me it really sets me that's it
nice on day
their claims are that it hydrates it
smooths your skin texture and it gives a
naturally luminous finish I agree I
actually really liked it I thought I
would hate it I don't know why I kind of
had this this thought towards Whitney
foundations and like I feel like I tried
her on the path I didn't like it I don't
know I totally like it where my skin is
right now it had about medium coverage I
couldn't get it to be like full coverage
but for most days I don't want full
coverage I wanted to I want my skin to
look evened out not red but I don't need
to be like ready to film a video kind of
coverage it all makes sense
do hear the rain it's been raining for
days and I kind of don't hate it and my
natural curls can fly free cuz my hair
gets wet it just dries to look like been
spinning away so it does better anyway I
rely like this foundation I wouldn't say
it's a favorite but it's totally one
that this is always my example but if I
were in a foreign country and I forgot
that maybe my makeup got stolen or lost
in the luggage whatever this is one that
if I saw it in the store I would totally
buy it because cheap one that I know I
like you know what I mean so I like it
my next foundation is from L'Oreal this
is their visible lift blur foundation
this is one that was kind of under the
radar for me for a while and then one
day I was like no one talks about those
I'm going to buy them a try and so I
bought Miami triumph I could be like a
name of the series that's pretty fun
anyway I bought the concealer from this
line and this foundation the shade I got
with 204 creamy natural which seems kind
of dark but it actually ends up working
pretty well for my skin it's just a
squeezy tube which I would much prefer
over a glass dump bottle but you squeeze
it onto your skin duh and I feel like
I'm just like talking about nothing
right now the claims of this is that
it's supposed to be kind of more for
mature skin however I'm 28 and I love
what this does for my skin so their
claims are it blurs the looks of lines
wrinkles uneven texture for a fresh
smooth youthful finish you'll love and
not a flaw in sight I think it's got
medium to full coverage and it's just
pretty again this is one of those ones
that every time I put it on I feel like
my skin likes it
and I don't know how else to explain
that I don't I feel like some of you
guys totally know what I mean though
when you put one on and your skin's like
drinking it up so I just like it again
it has sunscreen SPF of 18 and it I
don't think it clings to dry patches so
if you have dry skin I think you'd
really like this it doesn't give you
like a dewy finish I would say it's more
of like a satin finish it's certainly
not matte and I think because it's not
matte that's why it's more youthful
looking so it's just kind of in between
and I love that I really like the
foundation I'm always so surprised that
no one really knows about it
so my next two are two different
drugstore cushion foundations this is
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion and
it is let's see 12 shades and it's 1699
and then Maybelline has their dream
cushion they have the same packaging
where you open it up and there's a
little applicator and then you can open
it to expose the cushion so they have
the same packaging L'Oreal's is a little
bit cuter only because it's got this
pretty rose gold thing but they're the
same so the Maybelline one has less
shades where the L'Oreal one had 12 this
one has eight and it's a dollar less so
$15.99 $15.99
you can pretty much across the board get
two pumps for these wait for a buy one
get one half off sale don't buy these at
full price there's no need but I like
them both I think the L'Oreal might be a
little bit less coverage than the
Maybelline but honestly you guys when I
could do half the face of each I don't
notice a difference between them I
really don't just kind of a matter of
maybe like the packaging and one more
maybe ones on sale when you want it
maybe one has your shade a little bit
better than the other line they're the
same thing I could if someone's
blindfolded me and put them on I would
never be able to tell the difference so
it's really impossible for me to say if
I like one more than the other because I
just don't but I think for me it would
just come down to which one's on sale
the week I'm trying to buy it you know
what I mean in the L'Oreal I have the
shade W too and it's a great match for
me and then in the Maybelline once I
have shade 20 and 30 and 20 is a great
match for me so my next one is the
L'Oreal infallible total cover
Foundation and this one has 12 shades it
retails for $12.99
what I actually really like the
packaging for it's a very thick
foundation very very thick very moosie
and I think it fills fine lines I mean
truly it's full full full coverage if
you're looking for the most full
coverage foundation you can find at the
drugstore in my opinion this is it it is
you can't see your skin underneath it
period and frankly I think this would be
great there's no SPF so there would
probably be no flashback with this this
would be a great event makeup if you're
maybe it's a wedding maybe it's a I
don't know if you're going to events
with there's flash photography whatever
I think this would be great for that if
you're looking for one maybe prom
because it completely gets rid of any
imperfections redness anything like that
now if you have dry skin it does
highlight it a little bit for me that's
not totally a deal-breaker for an event
because I'm not as concerned about
people being like this close to me and
seeing dry skin I'm more concerned about
how does it look in photographs how does
it look from maybe a little bit of a
distance how does it look all together
with the rest of my makeup and so for
that I think this is amazing event
foundation weddings graduations I don't
know I don't know why I feel the need to
list off any possible events but I think
you guys get the idea and for a
drugstore foundation to be this high
coverage I think it's pretty amazing so
for that I think that's awesome I have
the shade 302 in that one I want
advisory or two because I bought 302 two
in the visible list and I liked it I
think that one's not a perfect match for
me that it's pretty close it's a little
bit more kind of dull my skin that she
so my next one is the Maybelline Dream
velvet foundation this is supposed to be
a soft matte hydrating foundation so
it's kind of a weird mix of ideas there
this one has 12 shades that retails for
1099 and I am in the shade 20 classic
ivory just a squeezy tube again it's
again a thick foundation
it's a terrible shade match for me by
the way very very orange this is more of
a whipped formula I
this is shade 20 which is a great match
for me in the dream cushion in their
line but wearable I mean horribly orange
for me so I need to get another shade
because because of the shade I've only
tried it a couple times and I've had to
take it off it's not coming across on
camera how orange it is but it's not my
favorite I feel like I end up blending
it and it just keeps blending back and
forth and never really sinks into the
skin because it's trying to bridge that
gap between you know hydrating but also
this soft matte kind of moosie texture
and it just doesn't really mesh well
with a sponge or a brush probably best
with your fingers and even that doesn't
look great I think I still want to try a
little bit more and maybe get the
correct shade to really give my full
thoughts this is one of the only ones
this is the only one I've tried the
least amount of time and I I don't know
that I would recommend it regardless of
the shade because it just doesn't seem
to really ever blend into your face
properly you can hear it in there
because it's all stuck together because
it's that whip formula it's not actually
shaking it's all one piece kind of
moving back and forth so kind of an
interesting thing if you think you'd
like that maybe maybe if you have
perfect skin no dryness and maybe no
oiliness it's right in the middle it
might work for you but I think if you're
either way you wouldn't really like it
my next foundation is the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation I haven't
the shade 200 it's kind of a little bit
darker than my skin but the one below it
wasn't quite right either I love this
stuff when I did my wedding makeup video
where I talked about what I wore and
then drugstore equivalents this is
totally one that I would recommend for
that as well it's got great coverage it
lasts all day it no flash back no SPF in
it I don't love that it's in a pot if
they say it's like a mousse bite texture
and it totally is but this one blends in
a lot better than the what was it the
Maybelline one it just does it's a
softer formula it feels your skin will
soak soak it in just a little bit better
so it blends into your skin better and
for that reason if you were looking for
that kind of
nation I think this would be a better
option than the Maybelline Dream velvet
just because it this just feels cheaper
when you're applying it to your skin
this fun feel so much more luxurious
feels like it's maybe a little bit
better for your skin in that way
so I do love it I would recommend it for
wedding days as well you don't need as
much cover to still cut full coverage
but I think it looks just a little bit
more natural than the L'Oreal infallible
total cover so but they're both really
good I think for my skin however I end
up liking this one a little bit better
than that when it comes to if someone
was to be close up to me this looks a
little bit more natural my next one is
from number 7 you can buy this at Target
which is where I bought it ultra sells
it as well now at least online are not
sure about in store but it's their lift
and luminate foundation this they have
eight shades of at least at Ulta and it
retails for $15.99 this is a beautiful
foundation it's my favorite everyday
foundation because it still covers I
would say like medium coverage but it's
comfortable and it looks so beautiful
like I'm like glowing thinking about it
because it's one of those few few
foundations I've ever tried then when I
put it on I'm like like my skin looks
youthful and glowy but covered enough
it's not taking up and weird spot the
chips so beautiful it's so so beautiful
so the packaging it has a nice pump it
you know
the shades there's only eight shades so
it's not a huge shade range but if I ran
out of this I would 100% I will buy it
again because I will end up running out
of this it's one that every time I see
at my dorm like I want to use that and
then I must know I need to try this out
someone oh you know but it's beautiful
medium coverage I would say comfortable
dry skin would love it I think even if
you have oily skin this doesn't end up
making your skin look like an oil slick
it's not that kind of illuminating
ruminating luminizing foundation it's
just it makes your skin look healthy
that's where the glow comes from it's
not shimmery glittery anything like that
I love it so my next one is from number
7 again it's there stay perfect
foundation this they have 15 shades of
and it retails for $15.99 and again
these are sold
oops as well but these are quickly
becoming my Holy Grail when it comes to
when I want full coverage but it can't
be for an event because there is SPF in
it so on days that I film I usually wear
this on days that maybe if I'm having
like a conference with a parent or
something like that where I want to look
my best I love this stuff now I haven't
found my perfect shade which is why I
have two of them
I've calico which is a little bit too
light warm I agree which is a little bit
too dark which by the way I had warm
ivory in the lift and luminate it's
perfect so I need to find the shade in
between but I've just been mixing these
I love applying with a sponge it has
beautiful packaging great pump I mean
these are just amazing so full coverage
comfortable it doesn't highlight my dry
spots and I just feel it says it's long
lasting up to what do they say 17 hours
I'm always curious of how they test that
to know what why 17 not 18 or 16 you
know it says coverage medium I totally
disagree I really think it is full
coverage now it's not as full coverage
as like this so I guess in that respect
it's medium but for me it when I think
of full coverage I asked myself does it
cover absolutely everything I want
covered and this does so I guess that's
my definition but it would vary is kind
of subjective right but totally
recommend this to people that ask me
like what's one of the best drugstore
foundations this is absolutely one of
them I can't wait to find the right
shade but one that I want to mention but
I haven't truly tried it but I did want
you to know that I have it it's the
number seven airbrush away foundation
say very thin formula where you know you
get it in the dropper and you drop it
onto your skin in my head is going to be
similar to the elf serum foundation but
maybe a little bit more coverage but it
says squeeze it dispense future up on
the back your hand serve from the center
of your face blend outwards using your
fingers or a brush so I haven't tried it
but I figured it was worth mentioning
that if you are interested in one like
this number 7 does carry one but this
one has 12 shades and it retails for
1790
I put is a little bit more expensive so
you almost have to assume it'd be better
off to let you know so I hope that this
video was helpful for you to watch I
enjoyed doing it because I feel like I
can really give a thorough idea of how
these products work at least for me and
also tell you about the shades and the
price and basically just a better idea
of what's out there right now there I've
tried even more than this in the
drugstore i declutter all the time most
you guys know that you watch my
declutter so I've gotten rid of a lot of
drugstore foundations that it just
wasn't right for my skin tone so if
you're curious about other ones that I
used to have and maybe my sauce on it
because it still might be good for you
if you have different skin than me I
will link my foundation to colors that
I've done in the past you can kind of
get an idea of ones that I didn't like
enough for me but it might still be good
for you or maybe other ones you should
avoid so I will link those below I hope
that you'll subscribe to catch more of
these types of videos let me know by
giving this video a thumbs up if you'd
like more of these collection style
review videos and I would be glad to do
