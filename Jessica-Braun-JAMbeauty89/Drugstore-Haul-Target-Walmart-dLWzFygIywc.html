got another target haul for you / like
drugstore haul because a few of the
things that I got I got from like
Walmart and or Kmart so okay so one of
the things that I got that I was really
excited about and I actually had a
dollar off coupon but of course what
else is there for the Nivea lip butter
and Target calm has a coupon for it
right now for $1 off of these so
definitely go on there and check it out
I think you have to print it out there's
not like a barcode like if you pull it
up on your phone or anything like that
so you actually have to print it out but
they have a couple different scents and
I got the raspberry rose a kiss it
smells so good and I put it on last
night I guess I could put some on top of
what I got on now it's just like first
of all like I said it smells incredible
and I know they have like a vanilla
macadamia one or something like that and
then one or two others but this one just
it's oh my gosh it just smells so good
okay um so another thing that I got was
this is actually from Kmart the Jordana
retractable eyeliner I really like what
is it from Jordana that I really like I
can't now of course I can't think of it
but I've heard good things about Oh a
duh it's the other eye line and they
have a liquid eyeliner that I really
like called their fabula but I picked
this one up a sheer retractable so I'm
hoping it's really good just like the
fabula is because I definitely needed
another one of these so yeah I'll let
you guys know how I like it
another thing that I got and this I got
from Walmart I on my nails right now is
that mint delicious from the Rimmel
60-seconds line and this is another one
I picked up called blue eyed girl and
it's just this really nice a little bit
deeper than cobalt blue shade I really
really like I'm excited to try it on
the thing about mint delicious though is
it's a very different shade than what it
is in the bottle I don't know if that's
true for all of the Rimmel sixty-second
polishes or if that's just the way that
one is so I'll let you guys know if this
ends up being the same shade or not and
if you have any more experience with
these let me know if you've noticed the
same thing with other colors or not
because this is a lot bluer than it
looks definitely like a mint green in
the bottle but it looks kind of more
like robin's egg blue if you
on my nails another thing I got was the
wet-and-wild single eyeshadow in nutty
because I'd heard it's a good dupe for
the Mac satin taupe which I've never
tried but I like the shade of it and
I've heard good things so I figured this
is where the shots only like a dollar
ninety-nine anywhere you go it's a
really really pretty kind of mousey
Brown so I'm excited to do that one I
try okay
okay another thing I'm really excited
about and I used it in my hair today but
then I put it back in the package so you
guys can see it this is the renewing
Moroccan argan oil and my friend Hannah
had told me that she'd been using some
sort of argan oil or something like that
and I was feeling her hair and it is so
incredibly soft so I was like okay I've
gotta try this so I had like a few
different kinds in my car at Walmart I
think it was and then I ended up going
with this one cuz they were all around
five or six dollars at least the ones I
was looking at this one I mean it just
was great I the bottle is just cute you
know and I think this one was like 574
around $6 and my hair feels so much
softer it was so much easier to manage
while blow-drying and after blow-drying
it and what I did was I just put a
little bit in my palm after ital dried
and brushed out my hair and I just
flipped my hair over and got it as
evenly as I could throughout my hair and
then flip my hair back and got a little
bit more and did it again and it was
like instantly softer as it was air
drying which is really cool because my
hair is very coarse as it air dries so I
was really excited I'm excited for my
hair to get even more used to this and
see how it does it just feels so much
softer so I'm just so excited today's
gonna be a rainy day so I'm excited to
see how it does like in the humidity if
it like frizz is out or I'm just so
excited but yeah it was only six bucks
and you know you use such a small amount
this is gonna last forever and I know
suave has one that I might give a try as
well and maybe compare the two let's see
okay two more things Clarence earrings
okay
target right now I know I've said in the
past that they have a lot of clearance
jewelry right now it's like out of
control and on their website target calm
in the coupon section they have a $5 off
of a $20 jewelry and accessories
purchase you can kind of mix and match
jewelry and purses and watches
and sunglasses I think are the different
things you can mix and match spend at
least $20 then you get $5 off and that
includes clearance they have like a wall
it was awesome but um but they had all
their regular price stuff on really good
sales too so I mean they just have so
many cute things is out of this world so
this one
these ended up being only 398 though
these really light like Rosie or baby
pink earrings just really simple I just
think they're so pretty and I think
against dark hair that'll look nice but
I was really excited about these and
again these were is like eight dollars
and then I also got this necklace oh my
gosh isn't it so pretty it reminds me of
the necklace I'm wearing right now which
is from if you've ever had like a
premier designs party or ever been to
one of those like a premier jewelry
party that's where I got this one
because I hosted I've hosted by two of
them two of those parties but I got this
there and I just love it but this
reminds me of it's longer it kind of
dangly its kind of tangled of course
right now but it's just this really
pretty it's got these like light kind of
ivory like beads instead of gold chain
and it's multi-layered
but I like that it's just kind of simple
in like small chains so I'm excited to
wear this I kind of figured with maybe
some sort of plain color dress maybe
with a high cut what am I trying to say
just a high cut oh that's gonna drive me
nuts when you can't think of something
oh my gosh okay anyway that's all I got
sorry it's kind of low energy today I'm
just kind of like I'm so sleepy but I'm
so glad it's Friday anyway I hope you
guys all have a wonderful weekend and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
