say I know you're gonna say a halt are
you kidding me Jessica
aren't you decluttering didn't you just
fill in like five holes and they're all
up on your channel yes and yes however
this is also one of my jobs so while I
declutter and get rid of things I'm not
using or I've reviewed and I decided you
know it's not my favorite why keep it
when I've got five other favorites that
I like even more so with that mindset I
buy new things to try out for you guys
to put on my channel and to see if I
like if I end up reviewing it and not
liking it I pass it on to a sister a
friend I'm also a teacher so I can just
take a whole bag of goodies to school
and let them go through it which I do
from time to time as well so that's what
I'm gonna say about it let's get into
the home I am in love with the new
primer I love it so much this is the
Maybelline master prime bite face studio
primer and it has SPF of 30 but this one
there are couple times you gotta get the
right kind this is the blur and
illuminate and it's like 200 I've tried
the one that's the blue one that's for
mattifying or filling pores I don't know
what it's for but this one I was always
turned off when I see illuminating
primer cuz I'm like there's gonna be
glitter and shimmer all over my face
this one does not do that this one just
really moisturizes your skin and gives
it a satin finish so when you put
foundation or BB cream which I've been
using BB creams lately over it it just
makes your skin look that much more
natural and healthy and not mattified
and dry if you have dry skin like I use
so this stuff is really really wonderful
it reminds me of the Too Faced hangover
RX primer that I really really like as
well but way cheaper so definitely glad
I bought that one the next one I'm gonna
do a lip swatch video on these are the
new Maybelline vivid matte liquids and
what I've heard about these is that they
kind of they don't really leave a matte
finish they leave more of a satin finish
to them so I'm excited to give them a
try I got three shades I got this bright
pink called electric pink I got this
kind of peachy one called pink charge
and then I also got my favorite which is
called nude flush I'm gonna swatch this
one for you guys I'll do a whole lip
swatch video on these but they this one
is just so pretty that it's worth
mentioning right off the bat it's just
such a natural healthy fleshy color so I
haven't really tried these out fully yet
but I will soon but this is my favorite
shade out of all of them so far so this
was the time I mean this is kind of
collective I bought this up over the
past week or two but I bought two
different shades in two different
lipstick lines that have been around
forever but I heard people talk about
one of them is one that I wanted for
years why I haven't picked it up yet I
have no idea but this is the Maybelline
lipstick in the shade form with it as in
maybe she's born with it
maybe it's Maybelline that and so I
thought to myself back when I heard of
this color wow if they're gonna name
something that iconic born with it name
it's got to be amazing right and so I've
always wanted it it is this gorgeous
kind of very nude but pinkish nude color
it my lips are naturally really
pigmented so for me this is actually
lighter than my lip tone but it's still
pretty now this does have shimmer to it
when I wiped it off there was like
shimmer on my lips still almost glittery
so if you know you don't like that you
would like this shade but if you don't
really mind it like me I don't I mean it
depends if it's a crazy level of glitter
I'm not gonna like it but I didn't mind
this much I think it's such a pretty
color the other one I got was from cover
girls lipstick line and it's in the
shade sultry Sienna and I cannot
remember who I heard talking about this
here on YouTube but it's such a it's so
this formula is so creamy it's such a
pretty color especially for this time of
year January February which is kind of
cold and you want deeper colors but not
I don't necessarily want the darkest
color ever on my lips so I really really
liked that we're wondering what I'm
wearing on my lips I will tell you in
just a second so the next thing I got
some brow products two of them are kind
of weird one of them is like all I'm
ever gonna use for the rest of my life
for my brows I'm not even joking you
let's start with the two kind of mmm
ones this is the Maybelline brow drama
clear brow gel basically and the
formulas fine I used it today but the
Rush's what's weird kind of has this
weird ball on the end and I don't know
I'm still trying to figure out how to
wear it or how to use it because it
seems to do okay what I like this is not
a ton of liquid that that comes off so I
don't have to wait for it to dry or kind
of tap it off but I don't know the brush
I'm gonna use this out probably but I'm
not gonna buy it again just because of
the brush another one I got that was
kind of a dud is the Maybelline brow
drama crayon and I don't know the shade
I hate that thing on for shade names on
things but there's not a lot in it I was
watching Beauty with Emily Fox and she
got this as well and she I didn't even
think just to scroll it on to twist it
up but she was the one that showed me I
was like man she's right there's really
not a lot in it but um it's okay I mean
it's truly like a crayon but it just
didn't spread out the way I want it to
it didn't disperse the color as evenly
so even when I you know kind of lightly
filled it in and then I took just like a
spoolie brush and brushed through it it
just didn't look as natural as I like it
to look so for me I might try it a
couple more times but I just wasn't
impressed with the actual formula um one
that I was impressed with both the
applicators and the formula was the
Maybelline brow satin so same brand
Maybelline but way better so it's a dual
ended one one side is a pencil and it's
just perfect you can kind of like all
line the bottom of my brow and even the
end of it there and then I'll fill it a
little bit but then the best part is you
twist off the other side and it's a
little sponge that dips into powder in
there and it just so evenly disperses a
light amount of color it's so perfect
for if you line your brow and then just
fill it and really quickly brush it
through a brow gel and that's what I use
today I love it it okay so for example
in a given day when I'm getting ready
for work it takes me
typically with just an eyebrow pencil
like three to four minutes to do my
brows which I think it's too long for my
brows I don't want to spend that much
time on my brows in the morning I think
that's kind of ridiculous but I do this
has cut it to like a minute and a half
maybe even less
I should really time it sometime this
thing is amazing you could
so quick like I wish the change is not
honest so I need to figure out exactly
which one I think it might be deep brown
I don't know I'll try and see if I can
find it but I love it
game changer for sure so speaking of
brows I also picked up the Milani
brow shape and clear gel so I bought the
Maybelline clear gel it was okay I just
bought this like last night so I haven't
even opened it but it looks like it's
got a smaller actual spoolie on it so
I'm hoping that that'll help me be a
little more detailed and precise with it
now it's a clear gel so it doesn't
really matter but for me I don't need a
big ol wand up there so I've got high
hopes for this so I bought a bunch of
things from the brand boots number 7
which is sold at Target although I'm
learning from you guys that not every
target still sells it like some of them
don't sell it anymore but mine does and
I don't think it's being discontinued
there I haven't seen like it's the stock
is full and you know what I mean so
anyway regardless I wanted to mention
these because I'd love to do like a
boots number 7 video and maybe get a
couple other products let me know if
you'd actually be interested in it not a
lot of people talked about it but the
things that I bought from them just now
that I've tried for the past week I
really really like so I would love to
share that with you guys first thing I
bought was this number 7 lipstick and
it's their moisture drenched lipstick in
romantic and it's such you're gonna
laugh because all the colors I got are
similar I guess if you've got a taste
for a certain shade then that's just
that it's nice and peachy but pretty and
wearable it's really moisture drench is
a good name for it because it is
moisturizing it's comfortable it doesn't
bleed outside your lips I've only worn
it like twice so I don't know how it
works in all conditions but so far I
like it this is one that I like to form
you enough I want to go get like one
more shade we'll see I also bought that
I'm wearing this today on my cheeks a
blush from number 7 called soft damson
and it's their natural blush tint powder
and it's just a really soft pink color
but it's not like fake pink like there's
a swatch right there it I like it
because like even my down boy blush from
the balm I love it's a matte pink blush
but it's kind of a fake pink and while I
like that from time
time for everyday if I put too much on
that I'm having to do like more work to
blend it in more whereas this you it's
kind of foolproof you can just apply a
bunch you hardly need a mirror it just
ends up looking so nice so I really like
the look this gives me if you've got a
light skin tone like me you like it I
think if you've got a much deeper skin
tone this might look ashy on you just
because of the color but I see again
this is another one I want to try
another shade in because I really was
impressed it seems to stay on all day as
well another number seven product it's
their radiant glow concealer and it
reminds me of the YSL ones where you
click the back and it's just a little
brush
I have tried blending the same at the
beauty blender with a brush and with my
finger and I've noticed that I really
like the way my finger does the job so
I'll just take it and swipe like three
little lines there take my ring finger
and just Pat it in and it blends in
seamlessly and it looks nice all day its
brightening without looking fake and
that's what I really like about it I'm
starting to realize you know I'm kind of
developing my tastes with that and you
know certain pinky tone ones just don't
look good on my skin because I do have
more of a yellow tone to it so I'm
starting to weed those out of my
collection and get more yellow tone one
so I wouldn't consider this super yellow
tone so if you're neutral I think you'd
be fine I still think this would look
good with cool tones as well but I
really like this stuff I also got two
mascaras I haven't opened yet I'll let
you know when I do this is the number
seven stay perfect long-lasting volume
brush I just liked the gold packaging to
be honest and then this is the number
seven maximum volume one so I'm waiting
I have like four mascaras of them right
now which I hate I like having one maybe
two open so I'm making myself wait on
these but I will let you know once I do
the boots video these will be open so
you guys can see them so speaking of
concealers as I was talking about before
this is one of my favorites I have
repurchased this so many times this is
the maybelline instant age rewind
concealer has a little sponge on top you
twist so the product gets into the
sponge this is in the neutralizer shape
which is more yellow tone I used to get
the brightener one which I love but it's
very very whitish pink and so on my skin
tone
I would put it I blend it it would look
great but when I would look at it and
any other lighting like at work it's too
much it's too different then my own skin
tone that yes it's bright but it's not
necessarily flattering on me so this
seems to be a lot more flattering I've
only used it a couple times that I like
this shade a lot so I'm so excited to
have this again because I haven't had
one of these in a while and I love them
so much it's one of the few concealers
I've actually used up more than once
like I buy it use it up buy another one
use it up I love them back to Target
since we were talking about boots number
seven I also bought a Sonia Kashuk gel
liner what do they call it dramatically
defining long wear gel eyeliner and it's
just a little pot like this and I've
only used it a couple times it's a very
if you know much about gel and cream
liners which it's my favorite version of
liner ever I wear it every day there's
like really creamy formulas and then
there's really dry formulas neither one
they both end up lasting all day I've
noticed but it just depends on how you
like to apply it so for me I would
prefer a wet one over a dry one because
they just if you've got a really good
brush for it you can just whisk it out
fill it in and it's done this one's a
little bit drier of a formula I still
like it and I'm still wouldn't use it
but I almost have to practice again how
to apply
drier gel liners so will I buy this
again I don't know I need to use this
some more to decide probably not I also
purchased a mascara that I've loved this
is the Maybelline lash discovery mascara
it's got a teeny tiny tiny tiny little
brush I use it for my lower lash line I
get it waterproof because I don't put it
on my upper ones I only put it on the
lower ones and my eyes water
I'm also emotional so if I cry it
doesn't go anywhere I wore this on my
lower lash line on my wedding if I
remember correctly as well it just does
a great job of really defining those and
without getting too much on it too much
clumping anything like that it's awesome
I also got from Influenster which it's a
website you can sign up you can take
surveys and get free goodies sent to
your house it's awesome and anyone can
do it you don't have to be like a
youtuber or anything
I got a covergirl Vox box from them and
it
covergirl true Naked palette came in it
and it's in the shade roses now I just
watch the golden one they have three of
these palette there's a golden there's
another one you guys didn't know what
it's called I'll list it up here and
then there's the Roses the roses is the
best it is the most blendable the most
pigmented it's the prettiest in my
opinion and I own this one I've only
swatched the other side of it gotten to
use use the others but that's even what
I've heard here in the YouTube community
I really really like this one if you're
dying to try one I would say try the
Roses one they're super pigmented they
can be powder yet here's a swatch of
them you can see all the powder so
they're not perfect perfect shadows but
if you tap off your brush before
applying it they're still really
beautiful
they blend pretty well are they as good
as like to face no because those are my
favorite shadows and that's hard to beat
but they're really really nice even
still if you're trying to watch your
budget these are still kind of pricey I
mean the drugstore palettes aren't like
five bucks I wish they were but they're
not but if you can get a sale on it you
can get a better deal so I do like it in
that same box they also sent the
plumpify mascara this mascara is not bad
it's the brush is interesting it's a
really really big brush really really
big and it kind of tends to clump a
little bit but it I don't know it
doesn't hold the curl as well as a lot
of other mascaras from the drugstore do
like the L'Oreal voluminous I love it
holds the curl all day
this one doesn't hold it this long it
doesn't separate it does add some volume
so it's not bad I'll still use it up but
what I buy it again or recommend it like
as a number one awesome product No so
take that for what you will so I also
got some nail polishes um the one I'm
wearing on my nails right now is
actually only like 2 or 3 dollars it's
from sinful colors and it's in the shade
rose dust I just think this color it's
one of my it is my favorite color like a
pinkish purple like lavender and these
are great because they're pretty opaque
and you don't need a second layer which
means they're less likely to chip
because there's not as thick of a layer
on top of your nails for something get
under and pull up so I really like that
I think it's just a really pretty
everyday color I just love it
and then one of my favorite nail polish
lines ever is the Sally Hansen gel ones
miracle gel this one's in the shade game
of chromes I thought that name was
hilarious but it came like in a dual
pack these wrecks on clearance so I
don't know if they're discontinued or
not with the top the gel topcoat which
I've never tried I've been using it it's
pretty good ever I've used it with game
of chromes earlier this week and it
stayed on my nails for like longer than
ever to be honest I just put this on
today I didn't do a great job I was kind
of in a rush but and I put this on top
of it so I'll have to let you know if
it's any good or not I also purchased
some makeup remover wipes these are from
up and up which is targets Fran they're
a little similar to the Neutrogena ones
I don't use makeup wipes on my face
anymore I mean not that I never will
again but right now I'm not I'm just
using like cleansing water and a cotton
pad but I bought these to wipe off
swatches and things and then in a pinch
if I need it I can use it on my face as
well so I've used a couple of wipes off
I just wiped off those swatches it did a
pretty good job
the true test will be the next things I
show you cuz they stain so I place the
order on colourpop's website and what's
awesome about colour-pop is that if you
want to use glitter on your lid when you
use a loose glitter you're more likely
to fall out whereas with this it's got
glitter in it but there's not typically
fallout because it's a formula so Tyler
and I do this thing where we want to
remember to tell each other about parts
of our day like something that happens
or something we learn about so we'll say
we'll just text each other and say key
word and then whatever that way when he
comes home later I can say okay you said
keyword stuffed animal what was that
story about which that is what he just
put the key word I'm so intrigued we do
that does anyone else do that it's
pretty nice because then you don't
forget about what your day was about you
remember what you want to tell your
significant other about all right well
so I got two more of their eyeshadows so
this first one I picked out I was
looking at swatches online to pick these
out this is in the shade lovely I've
clearly already used this it's more of a
golden one these are so pretty I
actually put lovey on my lids today
I ended up covering it with so many
other shadows I don't know that you can
necessarily see it but I love this shape
and it's so pretty just on its own and
then the other one I picked out is
called girly and it's more like a white
it doesn't have glitter in it but it
does have this Sheen to it that make it
makes it so so pretty there we go
kind of like a sort of golden sheen
these are also gorgeous so that's I
heart this this is lovely and this is
girly right those pretty so I also got
some of their lip products I hadn't
tried any of their matte lip sticks or
matte lip colors you know I mean but
first I got a lip liner because I've
heard they're pretty good this is their
lippie pencil in found and I'm wearing
it today it's that perfect super bat
dusty mauve color I mean it's one that I
have like Mac's
soar but that is the driest lip liner
I've ever tried so I think I'm gonna get
rid of it now that I'm saying it out
loud
they are so dry and I shouldn't have to
work at it and frankly they don't even
stay on that long so I think I might
just get rid of those even though it
breaks my heart
I think I'm gonna because this is way
better and it stays in place longer in
its creamier
anyway so I also got three of their
ultra matte lip creams this one I'm
wearing today is in bumble and these
suckers stains so just be aware which
can be good if you wanted to stay on
your lips forever but they say so bumble
is just this really pretty kind of brick
colored color I mean I don't I don't
really know it's not breaky breaky but
it's kind of Ricky like Sienna
I don't the next one I got was in the
shade first base and it's just a really
really pretty pink like that
I think that's gorgeous and then the
next one I got is a little bit deeper
called bad half a little bit deeper than
bumble a little more berry tone I've
been wearing bumble for about two hours
I have been drinking coffee the whole
time and I haven't realized it so now I
did put on top of it so I told you I
line my lips with bound
I put bumble on let it dry and then I
took this Maybelline vivid
Matt lip in nude flesh and I put it on
the center and then kind of wet and then
I just kind of padded it so it kind of
cleaned up the lines a little bit so
that's kind of the combo element that I
actually really like it I think it makes
my lips look a lot more dimensional than
usual which is nice so those are all of
the things I've gotten recently from the
drugstore everything I purchased except
for those two things from Influenster
but everything else I bought I'm also
about to film a sleek haul which I
haven't decided what order they'll be up
but if the sleek haul is up I'll put it
right up there with that little eye if
you click on it you'll see a bunch of
videos or down below and down below I
should say other than that I hope you
enjoyed I hope that you'll subscribe to
catch more of my reviews of some of
these products and also more hauls and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
