humongous drugstore makeup haul for you
guys I'm so excited
this actually all happened randomly
because I was on my way to like a
professional development session and I
realized I was there 30 minutes early
and there was a CVS right there and so I
was like I'm gonna go look at makeup and
then I walked out with like a hundred
and seven dollars worth of makeup and I
was like how did this happen so fast
so very fast like 20 minutes fast so
let's go ahead and get into it
so if you can hear gross noises it's my
dog Pinocchio and there's some peanut
butter in like one of those little toys
and it is the noises he's making is so
gross but I need to keep him occupied
for a little bit so I can film so some
of this stuff is brand new but a lot of
it is stuff that's been at the drugstore
for a while that like I've heard people
talk about war maybe I have it and I've
just been wanting to try so I decided to
pick up so let's server some of the new
stuff these are brand spanking new these
are from Revlon and it's they're not
just nudes palettes each of these have
ten different shades I bought both of
the ones they sold this one's passionate
nudes this one has a lot of warm just
kind of neutral colors I mean nothing
stands out it's like not neutral
compared to this other one which is
romantic nudes if you look at the mold
you can tell romantic nudes has a lot
more like pink and purple type shade so
this one is romantic nudes it makes you
think of like Romeo and Juliet I don't
know why these colors do that weird
don't run out and buy these until I give
my like video review on these because
I'm not 100% certain that I love them
but I've used them a little bit I'll
give you more info in that video all
right so next thing a lot of these
things I'm wearing today so I'm really
excited about that
so I finally bit the bullet and bought
these L'Oreal visible lift products I
keep seeing them I've heard pretty good
things but not a lot of people talked
about them but I bought the visible lift
blur foundation and 204 creamy natural
which is actually a pretty darn good
shade for me it seemed like when I was
in the storm like I feel like it's gonna
be too dark but it's
really good and this one is more great
owned so kind of neutralizes a little
bit this stuff is really nice you guys
like it covers really well but it's thin
at the same time it's a really cool kind
of gel like foundation in my opinion it
blends like instantly but it actually
covers it's really I mean it is really
cool so if you can find your shade in
this I would definitely recommend this
definitely with that I also tried today
the visible lift concealer this is a lot
of concealer in this little tube
I used it under my eyes today and I also
use it I have I thought it was a pimple
until I remembered that last night
Pinnochio like jumped across me on the
couch and like hit me there and it hurts
like it's the whole area is tender to
the touch but there's like a little
scratch but it's raised so I thought it
was a pimple and then I was like no it's
actually from that I don't know why I
just told that story it did an okay job
covering that I wouldn't say it's
completely gone but it did it better
than some other concealers I have it
does have a little bit more coverage so
I really like these two together I've
worn this for the past couple of days
and really really really liked it so
let's continue on with face I am looking
for a cheaper version of my it cosmetics
powder foundation it's like their
illumination celebration foundation and
it's so nice because it's a powder
foundation that has a lot of coverage
but it doesn't make you look matte or
cakey it just makes you look like almost
not glowy but it just makes you look
like satiny and alive I love it but it's
kind of expensive so I've been looking
for a drugstore version so I tried this
this is the Neutrogena mineral sheers
powder foundation and I bought mine in
buff number 30 and it's can you guys
hear the noise disease making this is
absolutely disgusting I am so sorry
pinoke you gotta like chill out with
that man okay that's enough time it's
gonna die or I tell my how loud he was
anyway this I think is it has good
coverage I think it's a good powder
foundation but it's not exactly like
that one now in all fairness I've only
used this one so I don't I haven't fully
decided
any means but it did look a little bit
powdery like in the Sun whereas the
other one the cosmetics one doesn't look
powdery in the Sun at least not as much
as this so I'm so kind of figuring that
out but I like it it's got good coverage
so I also repurchase the Maybelline fit
me concealer I got mine in number 20 I'm
I know that like there's 10 and 15 and
like 15 is actually kind of lighter than
10 but I got 20 because they didn't have
15 and I felt like you know this
actually might match my skin a little
bit better than a lot of concealers have
lately because I do have a little bit
more color than usual so I figured I
would just go for it
this really is a nice just everyday
concealer it's comfortable I think it
covers enough if you've got severe dark
circles I don't think it'll cover enough
but you know just for everyday use I
like it and I just wanted to try it
again
this was new to me I haven't seen this
this was from L'Oreal and it's their
magic decrease and it's an eye primer
eyelid primer does it have like a shade
I don't think so but it's just a doe
foot applicator kind of an apricot
colored swatch there and it just blends
away it kind of does have that same feel
almost like a silicone feel similar to
like the Too Faced shadow insurance kind
of it's a little bit thinner than that
though I've used it a couple days I
think it does a good job I still want to
use it and find out how well I like it
but I I couldn't believe I hadn't heard
of it I don't know if it's that new or
if I just somehow it was like under my
radar another thing that I kind of
repurchase is a color tattoo I've since
gotten rid of all of my color tattoos
but I repurchased this one just because
I thought the shade was so pretty this
one's called the bad to the bronze and
this is really dry you guys I think I
got a dud I don't know if it's been in
CVS for a long time but like to get a
swatch of it it used to be so much
easier I feel like it's just I don't
know I have to go just like 15 times to
get a little bit on my hand however it's
still beautiful it still works so I'm
like I'm you know what I'll still use it
enough that I'm not too concerned and I
kind of figure if my hand kind of warms
it up it might help I don't know another
thing I bought was one of the Burt's
Bees lipstick
ones in 501 blush based on it I'm
wearing this on my lips today the
packaging is like plastic but really
cute and it has the color of the shade
all over the lid it's got kind of a
longer basin and it's just such a pretty
everyday color I'm wearing on my lips
with no lip liner it's very moisturizing
and just comfortable I mean just
comfortable I do want to get another
shade or two he's a puppy
you're almost like 9 months old aren't
you look at him he's like no I want to
sniff here make it look how big he is
big I don't think I've shown him to you
guys in a long long time he's head down
beagle sniffing everything hi guys so
anyway I want to get some other shades
of this because it is just so
comfortable and nice I was so impressed
so the last two things I got are cheek
products that I'll show the one I'm
wearing on my cheeks today first this is
the Maybelline master highlight by face
studio highlighting blush in coral and
I've owned the one that was like more
pinkish toned and this one's so pretty
because it's peach and it's got that
little bit of shimmer in it okay going
down it's got that little bit of shimmer
to it where it's just so pretty it is
really do stay on all day long and the
last thing I picked up was this Milani
illuminating face powder and this used
to be like a big deal for a while here
on YouTube I want to say like two years
ago
when they first came out with these cuz
they're so cute Milani is so good this
one's in the shade I think it's his
beauty's touch it's got that like
cvs/pharmacy thing on and I can't really
read it but you kind of swirl it
together and for me this will work as a
blush but if you're not as light as I am
it might almost be like a pink type
highlighter but I think this is so
pretty I wore this yesterday to work and
I loved it it just looked so healthy but
not really like Glo glowy but just
healthy and I think you'd get away
without wearing a highlighter with it
but it looks even more beautiful with a
highlighter so those are all the things
I purchased I hope that you enjoyed let
me know what you'd like to see reviews
on like I said I will do a swatch review
of the Revlon palettes for sure but if
anything else strikes your fancy and
you'd like to know more
let me know down below I hope you'll
subscribe to catch more of my videos and
I'll see you guys in my next one
