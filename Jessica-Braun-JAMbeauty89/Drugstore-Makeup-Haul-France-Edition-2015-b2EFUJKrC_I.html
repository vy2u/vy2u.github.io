again in Paris still my drugstore haul
of makeup and there's also some like
body and hair products just kind of a
mishmash of all kinds of beauty goodies
if you didn't already know which I think
most of you do and I'm sorry if you're
tired to be saying it but for those that
don't know we are currently in Paris on
our honeymoon and we've been vlogging
every single day here we are having a
blast so on Tyler's channel is where all
the blogs are going up every single day
and what I think we're going to vlog
tight are we just gonna walk straight
through like Disney - might as well you
get bored when you're in line you'd
rather talk to a camera than just like
sit there anyway so definitely check
them out I will link the playlist of all
the vlogs on his channel below so you
can catch them all so let's go ahead and
get into it now if you saw my Sephora
haul a lot of that makeup that I bought
there were things that I could have
bought in America as well but I was just
splurging I'm on my honeymoon but these
things for the most part of things that
you really can only get here in Europe
or at least things you can't get in the
u.s. so some of this I have found online
and it's not as expensive as some of the
other things would be online if you are
living in America like I do
so I will link that below if I find them
so the main brand that I bought things
from was bourgeois bushwa bourgeois I've
never it's one of those pronunciations
because that's the one I've heard the
most about and some of the other brands
I really didn't know much about myself I
don't really want to spend all this
money on stuff I might still go back and
get some but anyway the first thing I
was so excited to get from booyah is
there food raid Ariz um I know I'm
 you're eating this but it's I
guess one of the it's like a kind of I
would call it a highlighting powder but
it's one of their original products that
they re-released when it was their
anniversary recently and it's just kind
of this cute plastic packaging and it's
a sifter and it's this powder that's
kind of like a universal translucent
powder but it's got this
a shimmery quality to it so it's a very
beautiful kind of natural highlight I'm
wearing today you probably you can kind
of see it a little bit I just like it a
lot in it all of the products are very
scented like very very fragrance so you
know you're sensitive you might not like
it but I actually kind of like the smell
so I'm in this just I love that so like
old school the next thing I got from
Bourjois
is their bronzer they're like chocolate
bronzer but I didn't get they had like
two shades of just the regular bronzers
I decided I saw they had like a duo so I
bought the duo because I thought that
was so cool so this is number 55 um and
the powder looks I mean really I don't
know which shade it looks like but a lot
like that very truly a bronzer not a you
know contour or anything but they're
they're really are nice I've heard that
some people will get hard pan on these
so so far our quartz I've only used it a
few times so I haven't experienced it
yet but I will let you guys know if
you're thinking about getting this if it
does form a hard pan because I have
heard there's notorious for that
speaking of bronzers one of the things
that got is their Sun illusion blur skin
pefector so it's essentially a cream
bronzer now I had been looking for
they're like bronzing primer which is
supposed to be similar to like the
Chanel Soleil de tan or whatever it's
called um
tanda Chanel so whatever um but I
couldn't find it but I found this is
like a limited edition collection and of
course literally the next day I was in a
different store and found the primer the
bronzing progra I was like these are
almost the exact same products I didn't
really feel like buying that but it
truly is like a cream like a mousse
texture so I could I could push my
finger right through it if I wanted but
I think the way that I'll use this it
really is soft is to you know if I'm
kind of bronzing use this with a stipple
brush maybe one from ELF and just kind
of stipple it in those areas really
lightly and I think what I'll probably
do I have to use this yet
is do this on my hand just like I did
then simple into this because I think if
I'm using it straight from the pan it'd
be it'd be too much but it actually
seems like a it's kind of oranjee but I
could see that that could be really nice
if it's kind of blended out like I did
here on the side there um so we'll see
I'm excited to give us a try I've never
had anything like this and I got this in
the shade 71 by the way I think they
have some shades we've been drinking
good ton of um espresso sorry I'm like
hiccupping and we want to get a Nescafe
machine like now or in Nespresso so it's
called machine whatever it is we want
what we we both like it espresso I keep
taking expresso we both like espresso
but we've never really gotten into the
whole nest Nespresso bandwagon I don't
know but now I want one cuz they have
one of the machines here and it's
awesome and so many flavors of coffee
they gave us okay so next things I had
to buy it
everyone say it with me
the Bourjois healthy mix serum I got it
in the shade 52 it's I actually I
bronzed up a lot using that chocolate
brown stirrer today um I think this
shade is too like me right now because
I'm getting some Sun I've just been out
and about obviously this is in 52
vanilla like I said I think right now I
could probably do 53 but I wanted since
I knew I would really be able to buy it
for a while I wanted to get a shade that
year-round I'd be able to wear and this
is something I can wear and bronze up or
I could just wear like when it's fall
and winter so that's why I went with
this but it really is nice wear it today
it's just I've never really had a
foundation like this and I don't it's
almost like a cross between the regular
in my opinion like a regular foundation
like Revlon Colorstay
and like a whipped foundation like the
Colorstay whipped it's like if you mix
those two it's just nice but it's like a
thin layer it's really really nice
I will probably do like a review video
on this when I get back home to the
States soon I also got two of their
flashes because they're so cute like
these little round things and they're
actually magnetic I didn't realize
you'll see it's a magnetic closure which
is way nicer than these little round
pots are just so famous so I got two
shades oh this one's healthy mix and I
got it because it looks like a really
pretty peach color and of course it is
it really these are powdery
though but once they're on they're on
and they're beautiful but I love this
color and it comes with like a little
domed brush that just kind of fits on
top of it I probably will eventually not
keep it in there because it drives me
nuts but isn't that a beautiful color
and the other car got was songs what did
Rose brood don't laugh at me okay so I
don't I don't know what that means one
of you guys I'm sure will be able to
tell me but it's just a really nice pink
color so putting that next one this
really is a cool tone pink which are my
favorite kinds of blushes right there
but I thought these were very wearable
colors and again highly fragrance but I
really like the scent um so I was really
excited to get these I wanted to get
some of the cream ones but they only had
a couple where I was and I remember I
wasn't in love with any of the colors
but I still might we'll see I got some
buchwald lip products which is what I'm
wearing on my lips right now I'm wearing
two of these so I got there um Rouge
Edition lipstick and it's in the shade
0-4 and this is almost my exact lip
color naturally but of course a little
more even a little more pigmented it is
oh my gosh like the best lip color ever
now I did end up darkening this on my
lips by the way to speak to the formula
look how creamy it is completely opaque
so creamy oh my gosh like I might get
some more of these because these are
sleep one of the creamiest lipsticks
I've ever used and then on top of it I
use their Rouge Edition velvet
kind of like a lip not really lip gloss
but it's in similar packaging where it's
a wand but it's a matte finish hence the
name velvet and this is in the shade 0-7
and this is just like a deeper version
of that color so I put this on top today
on my lips and it's again so opaque very
creamy they're not uncomfortable to wear
and yesterday I put it on before we went
out and we were out so like 2:00 in the
morning and I didn't feel like when it
wore off I never felt like you know that
dry cracky feeling you get with certain
lipsticks I never got that feeling are
so impressed so love these and then the
only other lip product out from this
brand is their color boost glossy finish
lipstick it says it's 10 our SPF 15 it's
waterproof I didn't even use this yet
what shade is this though Oh
proudly naked is what it's called and it
looks like it's a similar color to this
and it does kind of have that glossy
feel to it and it's a little more you
know see-through it's not as opaque
which is fine and for something like
this
the only way I like crayons like this is
if they're just more of a natural color
because when they're bright and they're
kind of sheer I just don't like the way
that looks on my lips and it might be
because my lips are so naturally
pigmented that it just ends up looking
messy but with something like this it's
it it worked so that's why I went with
this and I've heard these are really
really nice okay so the only other
makeup product that guys from a
different brand
it's from une natural beauty U and E and
I got this it's called their breezy
cheeks blush and I loved the packaging
because you just slide it open and then
you can shut it back I just thought that
was so cute I kind of want to get
another so when I bought it
they had testers out for all of this
which was so exciting to me I thought
this was a just a regular blush but it's
actually like a I guess a cream to
powder but it all so cool it's a creamy
powder for sure but it's this beautiful
natural pink there it is right there I
just love it it's very NIC like I said
natural
guess that's the idea again I wore this
last night and it lasted all day any
kind because it's kind of that cream to
powder it kind of gives this natural
glow where you almost don't even need a
highlight it just looks gorgeous in any
light so I love this this one doesn't
have a smell but love it oh and the
shade I got is b02 in case you were
curious now I bought all of these out of
mono pre is that how it said and they
think they're pricey are there than they
are at most drugstores but that was the
only place I found anywhere around me
where they sold all this stuff um it's
been really hard to kind of find I've
heard the airport sells some actually
pretty decently priced makeup I don't
know if that's true you guys let me know
because I want to get more but it is
honestly kind of pricey Indian but worth
it so other products that you guys
recommended that I was like okay well I
gotta get one of them was this OH
thermal a vain Avene it's their thermal
spring water spray now I could kick
myself because I got this in a
subscription box awhile ago and I was
like boom I don't use it and so I gave
it away to I don't even know who my
sister I'm sure someone and now I'm
realizing how amazing this stuff is so
for me when my face is looking really
kind of powdery maybe I maybe it's habit
through today and I kind of reapplied
some foundation in spots or put on some
powder blush this just like reactivates
everything and it's so refreshing
it also says it's amazing for like
rashes or just irritation or anything
like that it's kind of a product that
just does everything so I really really
like it I got the small just because I'm
buying a lot of things and I still have
to fly home with it and I still we saw
our Disney portion of our trip and I'm
going to be buying a ton of things there
so are you trying to make room but this
is one that I did find online on
Birchbox combo Lincoln another thing I
got from your guys's recommendation is
the chlorine dry shampoo this is also on
Birchbox comm although it is a little
more expensive on there I haven't used
it yet but I've heard this is the best
dry shampoo ever ever ever so I can't
wait to use it I I almost hope I don't
like it because then it's really
expensive for me to get in the States
but if it's amazing I don't know but I'm
really excited to give it a try and then
this one I had to get the Bioderma again
I got a small one
cuz up a I don't know if I'm gonna like
it cuz I'm not really a big fan of like
micellar waters in general I really like
cleansing oils but I want I'm trying to
like them because you can get cleansing
oil the one I like is really expensive
so um although I guess this would be
expensive for me to get to anyway so I
got the small one so it's easier to
travel with but I'm really excited to
give it a try and since I'll be in
London in December I figure if I do love
it I can get some more then and make
room make sure that I have room to bring
it home because they have like double
packs of the giant ones oh my gosh
alright so some body products I got this
is one of my favorites it's love the
petite marsala it's their Fleur Dornan
share Tyler you gotta help me with this
pronunciation what's that Fleur don't
know hojae what he said I don't know how
to say it umm it is the best smell ever
body wash and it's like floral orange I
mean the name it's like I told my how to
describe it I've never smelled anything
like this if you're near if you live in
a place where you can get this get it
because it smells divine
another thing that smells amazing it's
Garnier brand and it's their ultra doux
body lotion and it's their Olive nathie
and it smells oh my gosh like sweet baby
wipes I know that sounds so weird not
like baby wipes but kind of like baby
wipes but in a good way
I'm sure that makes no sense but
that's the first thing that comes to
mind but it's like really sweet and I
love the smell this is so moisturizing
like I put it on my legs earlier my legs
still feel so just good and then the
shampoo and conditioner we've been using
because we just didn't have any since
we're gone for three weeks we were like
we're gonna need way more than any
little thing we pack so we figured we
just buy it here we got the ultra doux
shampoo and conditioner and this is the
avocado oil version some dripping on
myself it smells nice it's not my
favorite shampoo and conditioner I've
ever used um it does smell pretty good
but not anywhere near as good as the
other two things I mentioned but it's
very moisturizing but for me since I've
got kind of really semi fine hair and it
gets greasy really quickly especially
when it's hot out like it is um
I can't get like second day hair with it
you know what I mean but it is really
nice and it's moisturizing but it might
be too moisturizing for me oh and the
last thing I got I'll just show I got
these hair ties from that store I mean
it's just the mono pre store brand but
the color was like grey brown like this
is perfect because you know like the
brown brown one sometime will those work
but there's usually only black or
whatever and I've never seen this color
and they were really thick it came with
five I'm obviously using some of them um
really really nice so I just figured I
would mention that but those are all the
things I've gotten so far again leave
your recommendations below before I
leave here in a couple days and I am so
excited
also we're going to Disneyland Paris and
Disney World
um and I'm wondering I know Disney World
I've looked at their beautifully Disney
makeup line and it's kind of pricey but
I'm thinking you know what this might be
the time that I actually buy some of it
because I'm so curious I've heard really
good things so if you've tried any of
the beautifully Disney products that
they sell let me know what you've liked
and what's worth the money because I'm
dying to try some of it but I
want to like buy some things as they end
up sucking but they have other products
that are really good so let me know so I
hope you enjoyed the video please
subscribe and I will catch you guys in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
