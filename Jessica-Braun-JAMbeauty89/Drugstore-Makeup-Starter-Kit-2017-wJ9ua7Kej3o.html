gonna share with you guys what I would
recommend if you're just starting a make
up kind of my drugstore starter kit I
love watching these kinds of videos I've
never actually filmed one on my channel
doing this for years how am I not the
one yet but I know a lot of you guys
have been recommending it over the years
and so I finally feel like I found
something in every category that I feel
really strongly about so I feel really
confident in every single product I'm
going to mention you today and for some
of them I'm going to have options so
depending on maybe your skin type type
of thing I'll have some options for you
I'm using this cute makeup bag actually
elf sent me a long time ago but the
brand is society6 but it's just like
white marble bag that I've been holding
all this stuff in but I'm going to dump
it out and kind of organize it let's
start with primer because that is where
we would begin I have two options for
you if you have more oily skin or you
have enlarged pores that you're trying
to kind of control before you put on
foundation I would recommend the NYX
pore filler it's one of the best pore
filling products I've ever tried it
might be the best other than I really
like the milk makeup stick that I keep
mentioning because it's right in front
of me that's amazing that it's way more
expensive I usually apply it on my nose
even though I have dry skin I'll put it
on my nose and I'll just really fill in
that area to make it look more smooth
and less texturized but if you don't
have an issue with that or if you just
want something to really kind of
beautify your skin and make it look
really healthy I don't want to say dewy
but kind of do in a way so maybe if you
have more dry skin I would recommend the
Catrice prime and fine beautifying
primer this stuff is a pinkish tone it
is so absolutely gorgeous and it just
kind of blends in to make your skin look
kind of satiny and just beautify I can't
it's got this soft focus effect where it
looks like your skin looks like just
beautiful satin and I love it and every
foundation I put on top of this or even
the pore filler especially on my nose
ends up looking beautiful and these are
both so inexpensive so depending on your
skin type or you could get both because
I really do use both in conjunction with
each other so speaking of foundation my
favorite drugstore price foundation is
the elf flawless finish foundation it's
a really nice foolproof formula you can
have dry skin or oily skin I think both
will like this
it it's got medium to high coverage it's
just beautiful packaging it's got the
pumps it's got a glass bottle it's just
an amazing product it glides on the skin
covers imperfections and it stays on all
day so I mean it's got everything I
would ask for in a foundation I like
this more than pretty much every high
end foundation I've ever tried so
regardless of that this video would be
Trumpster or high end it wouldn't matter
I would probably still recommend the
same foundation I love this stuff for
powder I don't have a mattifying powder
I genuinely don't own one now if I were
to recommend one it would be the one
I've used since I first started with
makeup
years and years ago which is the Rimmel
stay matte I know a lot of people
recommend that for a good reason because
it's not a thick formula meaning that
it'll really quickly soak up any oil in
your t-zone without making your skin
look cakey and that's why that would be
the one I would recommend now the powder
foundation that I would recommend to
make your skin look healthy is this
Physicians Formula one it's their
youthful wear cosmeceutical youth
boosting powder they have a matte finish
which I don't own but if you wanted a
mattified look maybe you aren't really
go for that one if you're like me and
your skin tends to be a little bit more
dry get the illuminating formula because
this has these like I don't know what it
is about this stuff but I keep reaching
for it just gives you this healthy again
that satiny look it's not dewy I'm
wearing it today not necessarily dewy
but it's just healthy and I love that
about this stuff or if you wanted a
loose powder I know a lot of people such
as your beginners you don't need this
stuff but it does do a great job of not
just mattifying but kind of making all
of your foundation look seamless so you
can't see different areas where there's
blush and bronzer it kind of blends it
all together in my opinion and my
favorite drugstore loose powder is the
NYC smooth skin loose face powder I've
been using this now for probably a
couple years I think I declared it long
ago just because I had so many loose
powders but I ended up repurchasing it
this year because I felt like I missed
it it's translucent but it's not a white
it's more of a beige and I think that at
least if you've got a similar skin tone
to mine it looks a little bit more
natural than like a stark white like a
lot of other drugstore brands
so I really really like this stuff you
could use a big fluffy brush with it you
could use like if you wanted to buy a
velour puff you can buy them at the
drugstore you can also just buy them on
Amazon for pretty cheap either way you
apply it it really does a great job
so for concealer I have two if you like
more of a light everyday breathable kind
of coverage that's kind of brightened
but it's not a really high coverage
concealer you would love the Maybelline
Dream really this product surprised me
because you just kind of twist it up
into the brush and you apply it and it
just has this beautiful brightening
effect it blends in so seamlessly you
could just use your finger and it just
sinks right in and it's just so nice and
healthy let's see if you're younger you
would love this but even if you're older
I just really like it when I'm just
trying to do a nice look where I look
put together but it's not like full-on
glam look I love this stuff I'd
repurchase this a million times but if
you do need that higher coverage this is
the NYX gotcha Covered concealer it is
incredible it's a really thick formula
which is not necessarily a bad thing but
what I would say is if you are going to
use this or anything like this it's
really tacky and dewy looking but it's
got incredible coverage so if you put it
on your under eye you will need
something to set it with so you could
use your NYX loose powder you could use
this I've done that a lot before too
because it is brightening but if you
don't set a thick formula like this it
will just sink into your fine lines and
you'll constantly be dabbing because it
will constantly creep into there it
needs something to set it with so what I
would recommend is actually another NYX
product this is the NYX HD finishing
powder this is in banana it's a little
bit lighter of a yellow than most banana
powders are but it does such a great job
it brightens the area but it also helps
prevent that creasing under your eyes so
I love this stuff I end up reaching for
it all the time just because it's so
quick I don't have to worry about having
a loose powder out of any kind I can
just grab this I'll usually use like my
Real Techniques so I can find it my Real
Techniques little brush looks like this
the name has roped off I've had this
forever to swirl it in there swirl on my
under eye
I'm good to go if you're a beginner I
have an awesome bronzer for you this is
the ever-popular Physicians Formula
butter bronzer they have a light and
this is the white one I think they have
a medium and maybe a dark I know they
have at least two shades but this is
such a great bronzer because it's so
creamy it's not so dark that you're
going to look like a clown if you don't
apply it perfectly and I love that about
this it smells really strongly of like
coconuts and stuff which I like but if
you're sensitive to smell you might not
love it but I love this stuff it looks
so beautiful on it stays on all day
these Physicians Formula powders come
with a little brush underneath so it is
a youthful wear one I showed you earlier
this one actually is a sponge though so
you can kind of sponge it on I use it
with this it actually works pretty well
not my favorite way to apply it but not
terrible so I love that bronzer the
blush is that I would recommend are the
elf studio blushes I really like this
one it's in the shade mellow mauve but
they've got a million so you can find
one that suits your skin tone but these
are really inexpensive they stay on all
day they're really pigmented so you want
to make sure that you use a light hand
if it's a brighter or deeper blush than
your skin tone this one I don't really
have to use my hand because it is not
that you know wham in your face compared
to my skin tone but I love love these
blushes and of course you could always
get like an elf duo they've got a
million of those worth of blush and
bronzer duo but I know a lot of people
recommend those I wanted to offer maybe
a different option for you I have two
highlighters to recommend depending on
what you like if you don't know what you
like then you probably want a powder
like if you've never used it before
powders are great because you really
can't I mean you can get too much but I
love this Physicians Formula one I'm
mentioning a lot of Physicians Formula
so I want to say wait until like CVS
Walgreens run it they'll have like 40%
off sales for Physicians Formula wait to
get them because otherwise they're kind
of pricey for drugstore so I would say
wait for one of those sales or maybe a
BOGO fail to get these but I love this
pure nude highlighter it's got all these
different shades you can swirl it all
together highly highly pigmented you
could get just the deeper tones just the
lighter tones you could use this this
eye shadow if you wanted but it's just
such a beautiful highlighter
oh my gosh it's one of those that
totally took me by surprise by how much
I love this but I can't stop using it
and I've been using it now for probably
half a year so I love this stuff
but what I'm wearing on my cheeks today
as my highlight is this L'Oreal True
Match Lumi I think this stuff is amazing
and I feel like no one's talking about
it but if you've heard of like the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector this is the
same thing just a different you know
different shades so this is in the shade
ice they have a couple shades so you'd
have to pick it out based on how deep
your skin tone is or the undertone you'd
like but this one is a very pearly white
one but what I do and I'll show you my
me applying it I'll just spread it out
dip a brush into it and just kind of
stipple it onto my cheekbones I think it
looks really nice if you've got dry skin
you don't want to put a ton of powder
all over your face especially like in
the winter time so you know when I can
avoid it I'll use cream products so that
I can avoid using more powder on my face
because I feel like that just
accentuates my dry skin so this is one
of those things that I love using
especially in the winter or when my skin
is really dry because it does such a
nice job of illuminating the areas I
want eliminated but not making my skin
like it's not accentuating dryness I
love this stuff and it's going to last
me forever all right so let's talk about
brows really quickly and then we'll get
to eyes and then we'll do lips so my
favorite drugstore brow product has to
be the Maybelline brow fat and sometimes
it's called like a brow duo they're like
two different names so he's called
define and fill or something like that
but on one side it has a pencil which
you know you use to kind of fill in your
brows and then if you need more on the
other side there's this little sponge
that kind of dips into the powder and it
just really lightly applies brow powder
so you could use either side I feel like
if you're a beginner or even if you're
just wanting a great drugstore option
this is an amazing one because it has
bold and you don't have to buy separate
brushes for it separate things the only
thing you might need is like a spoolie
elf sells in $1.00 fully you could buy
to kind of brush through when you're
done because that is the one thing I
wish this have like three and somehow so
that I get out of that as well but I
love this combination I've never seen
anyone do anything like this and I
it's an amazing product all right so on
to eyes so the primer you're not going
to be surprised because everyone
recommends this that I would recommend
is the Milani eyeshadow primer it's
foolproof it's better than the high-end
versions of it you know I've got that
shadow insurance from Too Faced or the
urban decay one this is better you just
apply it you know all over your lids and
a little bit goes a long way I got a
little bit too much when I was applying
it today
but it holds onto your shadow like I
said I'm wearing it today under these
shadows it really does make a difference
like if you did one eye with a primer
and wine without you would tell the
difference right away it I shadow apply
it better on top of it and it stays
longer and this stuff is amazing and
really cheap and again I've had this for
ever it lasts for so long so I have two
drugstore palettes to recommend I really
thought long and hard about which
palettes I would recommend because there
are a lot of good options but I wanted
to find two that I felt we're really
really good compared to all of the ones
I've tried and I still think I still
feel like there were like three or four
that were really close contenders but
these are the ones I thought you know if
you're a beginner or you're really
trying to get the most bang for your
buck which ones would I say and these
are the two I picked so the first one I
picked is what I'm wearing today and
this is the covergirl true naked nudes
palette and I actually filmed a quick
tutorial of me applying the eye look I'm
wearing today using this this is the
only thing I used on my eyes today and I
wanted to show you guys what it looks
like in action so if you're interested
in seeing that I'll put it at the very
end of this video if you don't care
about the rest then go ahead and got
bored but I did do a quick tutorial with
this so you can know so you can see how
I created the look that's on my eyes
using this palette I think this is a
great palette because it's pigmented it
does pick up a lot of powders so you
want to you know if you're using your
brush you want to blow on it or like tap
it off any excess whatever you want to
do I know some people get so freaked out
if you blow on it but regardless tap off
the excess and then apply it you might
have a little fallout which you'll see
in the tutorial I did but you know grab
a big fluffy brush just wipe it away and
it usually gets rid of it but they've
got enough mass and shimmers in this to
create a lot of looks and actually I
didn't use it the two tour
no but the sponge that comes with it
pretty good because it has one that
comes to a really thin tip so it's great
for doing like maybe if you're lining
with shadow your lower lash line or
maybe you're doing it on your upper it's
really good for that so I love this I've
tried the Rose this one and you know
whatever other ones they have all of
them are good I just feel like the nudes
one is a really classic set of colors
the next one I would recommend is the
Milani if you can find it because I know
some people can't find Milani where they
live and that's why I wanted to have
more than one but it's the must-have
natural everyday eyes the palette is
called must have naturals that's the
shade and talking about bang for your
buck if you're into neutrals or your
beginner I think this is great because
it has a matte black it's got you know
some nice shimmers it's got a nice
medium matte Brown a kind of medium
bronzy shade and then like a matte light
beige it's really got everything you
need I think the only thing I wish I had
is maybe one warmer Brown that was Matt
as well but it's a beautiful palette
really every single shadow it's super
pigmented they blend beautifully just
the same as this I really like both of
these palettes so my favorite wanna I've
got a lot but again I had to narrow it
down I love this Rimmel scandaleyes Kohl
waterproof pencil it's really really
creamy just a pencil liner I use it on
my waterline it has not budged in hours
I've been filming videos for quite a
while today it just stays on all day if
you want it your waterline it will stay
there it's so creamy so amazing like it
says waterproof it's so cheap again this
is one I would recommend high-end or not
drugstore or not I would still recommend
I favorite cream liner is this L'Oreal
lacquer liner I bought this a ton I just
recently repurchased it and I had missed
it so much because it's so black it
stays on all day and it's just amazing
it's better I've tried so many high-end
ones and this is better than all of them
so I would recommend it again regardless
of drugstore not just like the last one
amazing product and it comes with a
little brush I don't have it with me
right now
but the brush that it comes with is
actually pretty good so you could
totally use that with it my favorite
drugstore liquid liner is this
since one this happens to be waterproof
I need to just get the regular one I
bought this waterproof one for like a
waterproof test that a bunch of
waterproof drugstore products if you're
interested I will link it below but it's
a felt-tip which again if you're a
beginner I think is the easiest way to
apply liquid liner the ones that are
brushes are just so tricky because they
can swing really easily I just don't
like them
I feel like felt tips are just easier
now I feel like the liquid ones might
last longer then a felt tip does but
this is so inexpensive it's a couple
dollars it is amazing I need to buy a
new one without waterproof and this is
what I used by the way to get mine
whether I do like a smaller wing or a
bigger wing it's just a felt tip it's so
flawless at doing my favorite drugstore
mascara is the covergirl super sizer
totally took me by surprise
it looked so silly and gimmicky to me I
didn't like the packaging I thought the
brush was weird because it had you know
two two of the four sides were like
there and all it was this product with
no little brush little hairs and then
the other two sides had these rubbery
little things aren't what but you use
the rubbery little hairs I don't know
what to call them life I've been about
fibrous either but the rubbery little
spiky parts to really comb through your
lashes and push your lashes up then you
use the bare parts that have just
product and no little sticky spiky
things to really get a bunch of product
on it and then you flip back to the
hairs to brush through I mean you just
go back and forth and it ends up pushing
your lashes up separating them
volumizing them and it saves it actually
holds a curl it's amazing so highly
recommend that let's move on to list
shall we so the list later I'm going to
recommend is one you have to buy online
and I almost didn't mention it I almost
have said I don't have a favorite
drugstore lipliner because as I've tried
more and more I kind of realized even
ones I've liked in the past but I tried
the river one I like those okay but as I
tried it more and more I realize it
didn't stay in place as much as I needed
a lip liner to stay in place so the only
one I found that's really inexpensive
but it's unbelievable quality is the
colour-pop lippie pencil but this one's
in the shade bound it's sharp and kind
of weird but it just I'm wearing it
today it just doesn't move it in it's so
inexpensive I think it's one
five dollars but again it's inconvenient
cuz you have to buy it online otherwise
I would owned every shade I only own
this one but it's so so good it's what I
wish every lip liner ever was like I
tried math once they're not as good as
this is the best so if you can you know
purchase an online go for it if not I
really have not found a drugstore liners
I love as much as this one I've got
these maybelline color blurs that I love
so much these are so they've got a
decent shade range I wish they had more
nude options but it's basically this
Olaf lip liner is thicker than a lip
liner and so you could use it alone you
know you could line and then fill in but
it's a really thin formula with a good
amount of color really comfortable to
wear and it kind of looks matte without
having to wait for it to dry so it's a
really quick foolproof lip color I end
up buying more and more changes because
I just love the formula it's comfortable
to wear and it stays on for a decent
amount of time and it's just quick so I
really like those highly recommend if
you're into more of a pigmented look
than those I really like the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte glosses they're not
100% matte by any means but there's this
nice whipped texture that is just so you
know really packs a punch when it comes
to color but they're so comfortable so
so comfortable they've got a good amount
of shade this one's in the color 318
bear attraction I have this red one as
well I feel like I had a couple other
shades but they're like at work I've got
some in my purse because they're so easy
for everyday this is this red one in
Shanghai scarlet and again they're just
comfy whip beautiful pigmentation I do
think you need a lip liner with them
highly recommend a lip liner with them
but they're beautiful and it's a great
alternative to all the really drying
liquid lipsticks you know what I mean I
showed so many of them your lips feel
crazy and dry but these are so
comfortable
but they have that similar look to them
the best way I could describe it as it
makes your lips look pillow soft and
assessable if you're going for you will
love these so the drug court lip gloss I
would recommend are the Rimmel
oh my gloss glosses these used to be
their stay glossy so I love the shade
it's actually in the state glossy called
blushing Belle gray
I also recommend the non-stop glamour
it's more peachy they're just
comfortable they're really shimmery and
beautiful they look great on their own
but they also beautiful on top of things
so this is a great purse block that you
can toss in throw on your lips when you
want to look more put together but you
don't have to fuss like I incident with
lipstick at all these aren't beautiful
so and I just think it's a comfortable
formula it's not too sticky but it's not
drying it's kind of right in between and
that's why I recommend it okay I have
two mystic formulas and then a lip balm
to recommend so I love the Revlon Super
Lustrous lipsticks this one happens to
be pink in the afternoon one of my
favorite shades but I really like
cherries in the snow is so beautiful if
you like a blue toned red this is just a
nice everyday pink there are so many
this shade range is unbelievable they
have some that are like historic shades
that have been around since they first
started a long you know decades and
decades ago like Hollywood actors wear
it and in their advertisements and all
those cool ones you can look all that up
it's really interesting but they have so
many they have different formulas
they've got the cream they've got maps
they've got luster and I think maybe one
or two more but they've got all
different kinds all different shades I
mean it's kind of overwhelming but
exciting you could look up some swatch
videos of these if you wanted I don't
remember if I've been I think I might
have done a swatch video if I have I
will link it below but I love this
formula it's just comfortable great
pigmentation you know it's not going to
stay on all day but most lipsticks don't
you know you are supposed to reapply so
I highly recommend the only other
lipstick line I would recommend again is
an elf product so sometimes you can buy
in the store sometimes you have to find
them online it's their Velvet Matte line
this is a newer line but they're so
amazing comfortable Velvet Matte is
perfect because they're they're not
super drying but they are matte so
they're comfortable and matte this one's
in the shade deep burgundy they've got
you know not a huge shade range yet but
I think because it's a newer product
they're coming out with more and more I
love this line again you'd sell to
reapply throughout the day but it's nice
but Revlon you can find in any sort and
there's so many shade options so I love
this baffling this is newer to me but I
fell in love with it
you're looking for a quick lip balm you
know as you're getting ready to kind of
moisturize your lips I love this
Vaseline lip therapy in rosy lips it's
got a little pink tone to it it makes
your lips look so healthy and beautiful
it almost looks like there's something
on your lips but it shits a lip balm
it's so beautiful and the few times I've
worn this to work people are like what's
on your lips it looks so nice I'm like
and I'm thinking it's literally rosy
Vaseline and that is awesome
so really inexpensive and it does have a
slight rose scent so if you're maybe
might not like that then you wouldn't
like this I think they have other ones
like other scents or whatever but I
really like the rosy one so that was
everything in my drugstore makeup
starter kit I thought about setting
sprays I really feel like I haven't
found a setting spray that I feel really
strongly about the L'Oreal infallible
one is good but it's really pricey for
what it is the Maybelline one is okay as
well but I just didn't feel strongly so
you know I guess if I had to recommend
one I might recommend the L'Oreal one
because I've tried it the most and it
works well but it's just so pricey so
wait you get a coupon for that but
