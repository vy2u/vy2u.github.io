going to be presenting my all about elf
video kind of like the best and worst of
the elf products that I have personally
tried of course you know there's so many
elf products out there especially if you
go to their website eyes lips face comm
I mean there's in such an extensive
amount of makeup that they offer and
it's so cool because what you see in
stores like Target I'm trying to think
of where else they sell it they sell it
at a store near me called Meijer but
other than that I'm not quite sure where
they sell it but what they have in store
is nothing compared to what they offer
online so and they a lot of times
they'll do like free shipping deals and
things like that so you can usually get
pretty good deal and they have so many
more colors available but anyway so some
of this is only stuff I've been able to
find online and others are things you
can find in store so where it's going to
be interred like kind of interspersed
it's going to be best and worse all
mixed together so one of my absolute
favorite elf products of all time I use
it every single day almost is the elf
High Definition powder but it's
specifically in the color corrective
yellow and I've tried the one that's
like the white translucent and actually
I have a small version of it it's called
the elf high definition under eye
setting powder and that's what I use
this for in the yellow tone it's kind of
similar to like the Ben Nye banana
powder that we all hear a lot about you
know it's just a really finely milled
powder and I use it to set my concealer
under my eyes and that yellow color just
kind of adds an extra corrective quality
to it
so in it my concealer never creases no
matter what kind of concealer I use and
of course mostly concealers I use
however are ones that I know that I
already love it's not like really you
know concealers that are terrible but I
love this stuff this one you can only
find online in this shade I think and
it's six dollars for this big honkin
thing I'm never going to run out of this
stuff and on top of that you get like a
smaller container Gandy pop some of this
into that so one product that I'm not a
big fan of from ELF and I might get a
lot of flack for this one
is the elf lip exfoliator and what it is
is it's like in a lipstick tube and it's
this really weird gritty you know
lipstick for lack of a better term and
you're supposed to use it you know to
exfoliate your lips get off any dead
skin cells and that's great the first
like one time I use this but after that
it starts to and I stopped using it
because I knew it was going to do this
and I'd heard someone else say this
about it it starts to wear down and
eventually there's none of this kind of
a moisturizing part to it that they have
still down here it's just the grit and
it it just rubs and rubs and rubs and it
seems like it's not really going
anywhere without that moisture it just I
don't know um so I don't know if you
guys have any tips for how you make this
work because it was literally to the
point where it wasn't feeling nice
anymore it was just kind of hurting and
I was like okay I don't want to use this
on my lips anymore umm so I was kind of
a downer I think this is around three
dollars maybe and I've found this one
online but I think I've seen it in
stores as well so okay one the elf the
elf studio blushes are amazing I only
own one
isn't that crazy I used to own a couple
but I there were shades I never really
used like one was a bright sparkly pink
and I think I ended up just giving them
away over time the only one I still have
left is candid coral it's just a really
pretty peach shade it's just so pretty
these are so so pigmented this would be
hard to see because it's kind of close
to my skin tone but it's just so
beautiful they're three dollars you can
find a lot of shades in the store and
even more shades online another elf
product that I love will be the elf
primer and liner sealer I've talked
about this one before one side is a
stick it looks like a concealer and you
might be able to use a concealer but
it's an eye primer and it's so it's a
really kind of creamy formula
it's skin toned if you're light like me
of course skin tone and so it just kind
of cancels out any like if you have
evading or any discoloration on your
eyelids before you put any shadow on
this is going to create a completely
blank canvas and then the other side is
a liquid and it has like this some kind
of like an eyeliner brush and you can
dip this brush
as that liquid on it into eyeshadow and
make eyeliner out of it in the eyeliner
that it makes out of that shadow it
doesn't mess with the shadow getting the
liquid on it which is nice and it's just
so really it stays on all day it's
really really cool it's three dollars in
stores awesome okay
oh my gosh there's so many another
product that I love is the elf
shimmering facial whip all the writings
rubbed off I think this is in the shade
lilac petal it's just a beautiful
highlight color it reminds me of benefit
high beam except for this one's a little
bit Pinker but of course it's not as
liquidy but it's the same kind of look
on your face it's a really really pretty
highlighter I don't use it every day
because it's a little bit more bright
brighter than I would want to be but I
really really like it these are a dollar
a dollar it's awesome and online they
have more shades but I really like this
one and this one I found in stores
another thing that I not a fan of from
ELF I kind of go back and forth it's the
elf conditioning lip balm first of all
this container is huge for a lip balm
it's like I don't know if that's coming
your arse is huge it has an SPF of 15
this is in like mellow melon I think so
it's just like bright red color melon
color but it kind of has a nice no has a
weird smell it has a plasticky smell
first of all of course that could be the
plastic on it but and it just dried my
lips out like crazy
it says conditioning I don't know maybe
my lips are just reacting weird I'm
going to give it a few more tries but
I've never liked the way it looks on my
lips and I've never liked it the way
it's made my lips feel so but I think
that one's like three dollars um one
that that's okay and it's good for the
price is the elf clear mascara one size
for your lashes and one size for your
brows I bought it for my brows I've used
it a couple times it's a little bit too
wet for my brows you know what I mean I
now have the Anastasia one or anastacio
whatever it is clear mascara for my
brows and it is the perfect it's not too
liquidy and what this is very wet so it
was only $1 and if you really
the one I would say go for it but but I
don't really ever reach for it ever so
um an elf product it's a go-to for so
many people it's only a dollar the
eyelid primer it's awesome I mean it
compares to any eyelid primer it is a
dollar and so it doesn't matter how
quickly you run through them they're
perfect they have a lot of different
shades this is just like the you know
the nude clear shade they have a lot of
different like colored shades online as
well so one that I really like is the
elf mineral foundation I have it in the
shade light as an SPF of 15 you know
it's just I mean it's like their version
of bare minerals you know um it's a
beautiful finish on my face I really
really like it um the only downside is I
don't like to put too much powder on my
face because then you know you look all
powdery and you know that's why I like
the Beauty Blender because it kind of
gets rid of that makeup II look but this
definitely has that but it would be just
like any other powder foundation when it
comes to that but it's a really pretty
finish other than that so this one's
only available online I think with six
dollars um another product I love and
hit wore off and I think this is a
dollar is the elf clarifying pressed
powder now I've never tried it all over
my face but I got it a couple shades
darker than my skin tone this is in
light beige and I use it when I'm really
really fair skin especially in the
winter I mean I'm always fair-skinned
but um I use it as my contour and
bronzer because it's not so dark that it
looks orange or brown or anything crazy
it's just right you know what I mean
it's just right for my skin tone so for
you very fair ladies I'm Irish I mean
I'm pretty darn fair check this out or
just check any powder out in a couple
shades darker and it's going to really
compliment your skin tone when it comes
to contouring okay so kind of I mean
it's so elf but switching gears there's
two products like this and I love both
this is the elf daily brush cleanser it
smells amazing for a brush cleaner and
it just gets the job done it's I don't
use it like for deep cleaning by any
means but you just spray it on your
brush wipe your brush off on like a
tissue or a towel whatever
just to kind of spot treat them but you
know spot cleaning them really does
wonder it's especially for brushes that
you paid a lot of money for but even for
inexpensive ones that you just want to
take care of so they last as well this
is great
and then the elf makeup mist and set it
has a little green tea cucumber vitamins
A C and E all these wonderful
ingredients for your face you spray it
on and sometimes I'll put this on like
not in the morning once I've gotten
ready but like you know maybe halfway
through the day or like after work
before I go out whatever um it just
refreshes your makeup it's really kind
of cool it kind of adds like a dewy
effect but not so much that it's really
that obvious I think it just really kind
of enlivens any makeup that's still on
your face so I really like it these are
both only three dollars apiece okay a
product I hated from ELF their cream
eyeliner I'm kind of a like cream and
gel eyeliner snob like I love not snob
really but I know what I really like and
what I look for in a gel or cream
eyeliner and this one's too creamy and
so for people that like creamier
eyeliners then you'd love this but for
me I was not loving it I think it stays
on okay I don't really remember cuz it's
been a while since I've tried because I
don't reach for it I love my L'Oreal
lacquer liner I love my Maybelline one
um you know so this is okay it's three
dollars though and you know what that's
not bad for the product cuz it's a lot
of product I mean it won't take you
forever to go through this and it's good
but for me it's just not my taste you
know and I think they have different
colors of this too so it's kind of fun
that would be a great way to get
different colors and not worry about
spending a ton of money on it you know
okay I just put something scream about
these a couple days ago the elf
contouring blush and bronzing powders
and someone says they totally copy off
of NARS packaging I'm like me yup they
sure do look whatever I mean they're
cute and the packaging is cute so I
don't can't really blame them these are
only three dollars apiece they have
different shades on line so keep that in
mind because most of the time I have one
or two shades and stores but they have
more this is actually called Turks
Caicos and it's kind of a lighter blush
than the normal one and then the bra
there's deeper and then this one is like
the original it was called blushed in
bronze it might have a different name
now but it was like the original ones
they came out with beautiful this I'm
beautiful I mean these are so pigmented
they last all day they are three dollars
if you haven't invested in one of these
yet you're crazy like what are you
waiting on if you if they saw like what
are you waiting on these are these are
three dollars it's like a dollar fifty
per thing and they last all day in their
pigmented you talked about yeah I'm
balling weight Harmon anyway so let's
see oh I love this product and I just
recently discovered that I love it it's
the elf eyebrow lifter and filler so I
got it in a shade that's appropriate for
me and of course now I don't see the
straight line or the shape but it's kind
of like a topi colored eyebrow liner you
know what I mean and it's got a
sharpener built into the thing which I
don't really know how to feel about that
and then on the other side it's a really
light colored like nude eyeliner you can
put right under your eyebrow to kind of
really make it pop and kind of blend it
out I usually do too um I don't use that
side as much but I do from time to time
hold on
guys I'm sure that sounded beautiful I
am getting over cold and I swear I just
have them like three weeks ago look
what's going on anyway this is three
dollars I love it I ordered it online
and I'm sure there's like different
shades so check it out what did it done
okay so the elf matte lip color this was
sent to me from a friend of mine and
it's in a beautiful color it's in T rose
that's right I loved that name and it's
a really kind of cool packaging it's
just like a little you know like a
crayon
you know lip crayon pencil but it's
thinner than most so it's kind of nice
because you can really get detailed and
I think maybe if you have smaller lips
too that might be more helpful because
you know how big those like Revlon lip
no balm stains are depute you know what
I mean I'm like dang it might small lips
I'd be like oh drop side the lines today
okay another one oh I didn't I like the
finish of this a lot I'm not big on
matte lips hmm but you know I like
it's a really really pretty color I've
worn it I usually put a gloss over it or
maybe even just like a like Vaseline or
some sort of bomb something over it um
but it's beautiful and if you do like
matte lip colors then you would love
this and then this one also sent to me
the elf shimmer lip gloss in the shade
hope and it's a gorgeous color I really
I don't own one this color and I really
really like it the finish is its a gloss
finish I mean it's a lip gloss the it's
hard to really compare because to me
most glosses are the same it's not too
sticky or anything like that and I think
this is only like one or two dollars and
I think this one's like three okay so I
have this in a Mac quad but three of
them are else shadows I get questions
about this all the time this is a matte
color this is max sable but the other
three are elf ones and I use them all
the time it's kind of my go-to because
they're beautiful shadows they last all
day they're a dollar and elf sells their
own little customizable palette that's
four pans that are empty so it'd be a
dollar for the palette and then you pay
a dollar for each would be five dollars
for an entire quad filled and you get to
pick your own colors and online they
have so many eyeshadow polish anyway so
my absolute favorite elf eyeshadow is
this one it's called wheat it's like a
kind of muted gold color and I love it
it's beautiful as a crease color it's
beautiful all over the lid it is just
beautiful and I love pairing it with my
liner sealer that I told you about the
elf primer liner sealer use that liquid
to make a liner out of it and do it on
my lower lash line it's gorgeous
um this one I think it's called
driftwood it's kind of like a brownish
color it actually looks just a little
bit lighter than Mac stable and then
this one's called pink ice if I'm right
and I think it's company guys I can't
get them out I put them in and they
don't like you can't just slap the back
and get them out like the Mac ones no no
you have to like carve it out once I put
them in I was like well they're in there
forever
this one's pink ice it's like a white I
don't use it as often but it's nice um
yeah so those are my favorites and least
favorites of all the health products
that I own and I think those really are
all the Elle products other than brushes
which I'm going to do another video on
that I own let me know what you are like
anything that I didn't mention that you
either love or hate please let me know
down below
I'm constantly buying elf products and I
don't want to buy something that is an
absolutely terrible product and also I
want to know about maybe hidden elf gems
whether it's on the website or in stores
that I haven't tried so Owen other--
thing - elf blotting tissues I love I
have those in my bag see I didn't even
know because they're always with me but
those are great and they're so cheap and
there's like 50 in a box and they're up
a dollar
anyway so I hope this was helpful and
that you've enjoyed it and if you did
like me subscribe to me write to me if I
write to me I mean like in the comment
box you know what I'm saying um but yeah
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
