have my ELF collection video and what I
mean by my ELF collection I mean I went
through and got every single product
that I own from elf or eyes lips face
and I'm basically gonna give you a mini
review of all of them because I know
that the thing about elf is they're so
inexpensive it makes you wonder like are
the products really that good or are
some great and some not so great and I
find that the latter to be true
basically that some of the products are
fantastic and then there are others that
maybe aren't quite as good that you
would kind of expect for that price
point but really some of my favorite
products are in front of me right now
and they were like 3 to 6 dollars some
of them were only a dollar and then they
always have 50% off sales almost always
every time I order something I wait for
a 50% off sale so let's go ahead and get
started so I've got brushes that I'm
gonna go through and then I also have
all of this eye oh my gosh so much stuff
so let's start with the biggest thing
here and basically I have my Mac palette
but in it I have a lot of elf shadows so
in here I've got a lot of their elements
eyeshadows which are basically they're
$1.00 shadows that you get just in the
pan like this and then you can buy they
have I don't have one but it's a dollar
for their little quad that's white
that's empty that you can put them in it
so really that palette is well made I
used to have one but I just didn't have
a use for it once I got this but it's
really really well made has a big mirror
on it and these shadows are great I'm
gonna show you some of my favorites
let's see there's this one and this one
oh my gosh there's so many goodies so
this one here is called taupe and then
this one on my middle finger is called
wheat which is like this pretty gold and
then this one is called driftwood and
those are three of my favorites they're
all such beautiful neutral shadows I'll
show you the swatch of them as well such
beautiful neutral shadows that can they
blend well they're only a dollar and
they have a pretty wide color range when
it comes to their website now some
stores actually have it online or what
some sort sell these but there's not as
many but online there's a lot more but
there's they're just so beautiful those
are my three favorites so another
that I have from elf actually a
subscriber sent to me it's their elf
eyeshadow duo and I find these to be
just as pigmented as the others look at
that whoo and this is in well it doesn't
say what the shades are but those are
that's a swatch of them they're really
really pretty and I love green eyeshadow
so I was really excited to get this but
I really like that now on to some of my
newer ones this is so exciting this is
the elf mineral face primer and this I
love because it's got a pump I'm not
sure if it was like you might've been
like 5 or 6 dollars but I find that you
can control how much comes out and it's
a really really nice consistency it
reminds me of the Smashbox photo finish
primer but a little more velvety I mean
it's watches out to be completely like
velvet oh my gosh it's just beautiful
and amazing and a little bit goes a long
way and I noticed that my skin it just
really kind of it's the perfect base for
my face before I put on foundation or BB
cream I really really like the way it
feels I haven't broken out from it I've
only had it for about I want to say like
two weeks now and I just really like the
way that it makes my skin look now it
doesn't it's not necessarily a
mattifying one so if you're looking for
one that mattifies this wouldn't be the
one for you but it doesn't make it do we
either I just think it's a nice clean
slate for it and then if you you know if
it's still to do it you can powder it
but I really really like that and I have
a feeling this will be one that I'll
repurchase again and again another
product that I'm just now trying out is
the elf daily moisture stick and it
basically comes like this
and it's just a stick that's basically
kind of this odd consistency you're not
gonna see it of course because it's
clear but basically the way I use it is
if I've got any dryness right here or
even like crepeiness down here I'll just
get a little bit on my finger and just
press it in and it just adds this really
it feels nice and it doesn't mess up
your makeup at all and that's what I was
scared about I thought that you know if
I've got this moisture stuff it I'm
gonna put it on there and then my
foundation will be out here but it'll be
missing here it doesn't do that it
really
presses in really nicely and adds
moisture without moving your makeup
around I was so impressed with this this
I think is about six dollars but again
on sale it's even better
okay another product from elf that I'm
trying out and I'm not sure how I feel
about it yet is the elf BB cream I love
the packaging it's really really cute
like a squeezy tube and then it's got a
pump here and again you can control how
much actually comes out with the pump I
it's the best I will say this it's the
best BB cream I've tried and I've tried
virtually every BB cream in the
drugstore
now I haven't tried many Asian BB creams
or Eastern BB creams if you will I
really haven't tried any so and I know
that those BB creams versus American BB
creams are pretty different but of the
American BB creams that I've tried I was
impressed with this it's got a decent
amount of coverage for a BB cream of
course you got to keep in mind it's not
gonna have full coverage so it's not
what BB cream at least in America is all
about and I don't know that it's had
great skin benefits but I know that it
hasn't broken me out and I liked it and
it's the first time I put on a BB cream
and look to my skin later in the day and
thought okay you know what I mean so I
think this is gonna be something I use a
lot comes summer when I just kind of
want a carefree face you know I'm just
going out and about and enjoying the
weather and it's got an SPF of 22 which
is really nice so 20 as well not 22 so I
was really excited about that another
thing that I just purchased is the elf
lip balm tint and it comes in a little
tiny pot like this and this is in the
shade grapefruit and it's just this
really nice kind of jelly consistency
and it does have some color to it for
sure but it definitely sheers out once
you put it on and I was just impressed
with this it was only two dollars they
have a few other shades and I just think
this is gonna be so fun that's it blend
it out a little more it's gonna be so
fun in the summer time just to throw on
my lips and it just feels good feels
moisturizing it's like I said a jelly is
a perfect description of the consistency
of this but I really liked it it was
like 2 bucks and I just think it's fun
ok another thing that I love it's still
in the packaging because I haven't
opened it yet is that makeup remover pen
this is the second or third one I bought
of this it's just I'll take
so you guys can see it it's literally
like a marker they should actually call
makeup remover marker or something like
that come on there we go and it just
comes like this and this is filled with
makeup remover so if you get like
splotches a mess scare up there you can
just kind of rub it out and then it's
gone now I always after I use that I
wipe this off like on a towel or a
tissue just so it doesn't collect a
bunch of you know black stuff all over
it but you know if you get it out here
it's great it removes it in like three
seconds flat you don't have to get a
cotton pad or a q-tip or anything like
that and the best part is you can take
this out and flip it around once you've
used it for a while to have a clean side
these are three bucks worth every penny
they're great to keep in your purse as
well just so you've got it on the go if
you've got nonsense all over your face
and then another thing is the elf zip
zap / this is basically just salicylic
acid and a rollerball form it's great
it's quick and easy again for travel you
can't beat it it's a dolla it is $1 I
love it even my boyfriend has one of
these he loves it because it's just
really simple now if your skin doesn't
react well to salicylic acid then you're
not going to like this but if it does
this is a great on-the-go treatment okay
moving on
the elf oh this one excited me this is
another new product the elf eye
brightener and I'm assuming this is
supposed to be a dupe for or at least
comparable to the bare minerals like
their mineral concealers like they've
got well rested and few others I
actually just ordered well rested and
it's on its way to me because I want to
compare these but it's just this really
nice light shade and they have other
concealers in certain shades this is in
the shade buff it says but I can't
really swatch it cuz as well maybe I
could no you can't see it but it's just
a nice light finely milled powder and I
use this to set my concealer so once I
put whatever concealer I'm using on then
I use actually one of my elf brushes to
kind of cover it and make sure it stays
where it is and it also brightens at the
same time and every time I use this here
in the day I just love it I love the way
it looks it doesn't make it look dry or
cakey or anything like that it's really
nice and I want to say this is anywhere
from like three to five dollars I'm not
sure exactly but I love it speaking of
their mineral products this is the elf
mineral foundation again
comparable to the bareMinerals
foundation I have it in the shade
porcelain which is the lightest shade I
had gotten it in light which is the next
step up and it was too dark for me so I
gave it to my mom but these are I think
five or six dollars it comes with the
same amount of product I think that the
bareMinerals one and it's just like this
I love this foundation and I usually
don't wear it alone however with the elf
BB cream it's beautiful if you need a
little more coverage than this gives
this will do the trick for you I'm
telling you ladies I am so impressed
with this when I run out I will buy it
again because it's inexpensive and it
just adds a good amount of coverage if
you're really in a rush and you just
want something this is perfect just dust
it all over and it just it's like a nice
satin finish it doesn't look dewy but it
doesn't look completely matte and it
adds coverage I love it I can't speak
highly enough about it oh I got it all
of it play so okay another product that
you probably heard talked to death but
for good reason is the elf blush and
bronzer duo this is in the shade blushed
and bronzed so this is their original
now I have their other one but it's not
with me right now I actually keep it on
my boyfriend's house because I love it
and so this is kind of their original
duo and the bronzer it's a little too
dark for me I mean I can actually wear
it it's not too bad but it's dark and
then the blush is like a really nice
peachy color there's a swatch of it
they're really really nice they stay on
all day like truly and they're really
pigmented I think that they blend pretty
well I think the blush blends a little
better than the bronzer does but it's
really nice got a big ol mirror and it's
three bucks you can't beat it and now
they have different shades I think the
one that I have at my boyfriend's house
is the Saint Lucia one or Lucia I never
know how to say that I think that's the
one and that one has a really dark
bronzer that I don't use those often but
I really like the blush which I think
has a little more glitter to it but
these are great great great great
products another new product is their
elf blush palette and they have light
and dark right now at least at the time
I'm filming this I'm wondering if
they'll come out with more but I got
dark because I looked at the light one
which would make more sense for me but I
was thinking about the blushes I have
and looking at the colors of it and I
thought you know what I have a lot of
those
already and I wanted to get one that had
blushes that I don't have already and I
certainly don't have I don't think any
of these colors they're really really
deep and dark but I love it and if you
use it with a light hand it's really
pretty especially in the winter time you
know like pale skin with like a deeper
rose color I think it's just beautiful
now of course even if you don't have
pale skin these are gonna work even
better for you get around because
they're a better match for your skin
tone but I'll swatch these if I can look
at that pigmentation are you kidding me
they're just so incredible oh my
goodness so certainly deeper colors if
you're a little scared of that again if
you use a stipple brush which else sells
a great one I'll show you in a minute if
you use a stipple brush it will work
great with these but uh and I think this
was like I want to say what five dollars
isn't that incredible so again if these
scare you tried to light for blushes for
that I mean you cannot beat that even
with their studio blushes which I'll
show you the one I have this is the elf
Studio blush for three dollars in pee
peachy no candid coral and it's just
this really light light peach color
which for me works I think if you have
darker skin it might look more glowy
than it does like colored you know what
I mean because I don't think it'll show
up as a peach color I think it'll just
look really pretty and glowy sorry that
was a bad place to swatch it but that's
it right there certainly really light
but a great formula but this is three
dollars and the palette is I think like
I said five dollars so that's like a
dollar 25 per blush and it's just as
good as these which are three dollars so
that's something to keep in mind if
you're wanting to get more than one
color now another thing it's in the same
packaging as those duels but it's
actually their tone correcting powder
and when I first saw this product I
thought I don't think I like that it's
the one that's got the four different
colors and this is in the cool shade
they also have warm and they might have
another one like neutral or something I
don't know but I decided to get it
because I'd heard some good things about
it
now I ended up loving this because when
you swirl the colors together it just
kind of ends up this white like scary
shade but when you actually apply I'll
just do with my finger when you actually
apply it to the skin it kind of cancels
out any discoloration because
that mixture it just works really well I
have to tell you guys about this app
real fast I'm sorry this is so random
I don't care there's this app called
field trip which is by Google and
basically it will alert you any time
you're near something historical that
has happened and of course I'm at home
so it's kind of funny it'll randomly
tell me but I just think it's so cool
so you open the field trip app when it
alerts you and it'll show you exactly
where on a map something in history
happened and I'm learning all kinds of
things about things right near where I
lived that I had no idea and I've lived
here my whole life you know in this area
at least so it's just so cool so this
cancels out discoloration it mattifies
it's just really nice now I will say I
don't think it's too powdery but I will
say that you should use a setting spray
or something to kind of add a little bit
of moisture back into your skin after
using this because I I do notice that in
certain lights it could be a little
powdery but it's so beautiful that it's
worth using the settings rig with and
you'll love it I promise
and that one's like three dollars
another product I've been using what is
the elf High Definition under eye
setting powder now this I originally got
I actually put a different one in here I
had it in like the white and it had
glitter in it and it and I would use it
on my under eye and I hated it so I
wouldn't recommend that one at least in
my experience because it literally had
finely milled glitter in it but I put in
the elf HD powder in corrective yellow
which comes in this huge honkin thing
but since I'm using it for my under eye
I dumped out the white and put in the
yellow in here so I don't have to use it
from this and I love it again it's like
it's similar to their eye brightener
mineral stuff but this one is in yellow
so if you really have some darkness to
cancel off I would recommend the yellow
over the brightener one but so I just
put it in here and it works out so well
I don't know yet if they have the HD
under eye setting powder and yellow I
wouldn't be surprised if they do soon if
they don't already because that's
something that a lot of people use so
love that I also love and no one talks
about this no one does
the elf eye primer and liner sealer it's
a little duo thing on one side is the
primer which is like it almost looks
like a stick concealer and then on the
other side you can basically use this to
Train
form powder eyeshadows into liner it's
like a little - look I'm pretty gross I
know you probably can't even see it
almost once in but basically it's a
little thing and there's a liquid in
there so you dip it and then dip it in
the powder and use it as a liner I do
that a lot for my under eye you know if
I want kind of like a pop of color with
a shadow I use and it really stays on
all day I love this and this product is
three dollars in the primer is fantastic
if you're near my skin tone because it
really does cancel out any discoloration
or veiny it's beautiful and it holds
onto that shadow all day especially if
you find that you've got really oily
eyelids this would be great for you
because some of those more creamy liquid
products yeah that's what I meant the
like the liquidy products don't hold on
to the shadow as well if you're so early
but this is great for oily eyelids cuz
it's a little bit creamier and thicker
another product I tried out is the elf
eyebrow treat and tame and this I got it
in the shade ash we just well my
eyebrows I don't like them too dark
because they're just not naturally that
dark and I've tried it and I just don't
like it that way at least on me that is
so I got it in ash and it's okay I wish
it was a smaller spoolie kind of like
the benefit gimme brow but I'll kind of
do a little swatch of it right there if
that makes any sense that's it so that's
the ash color it's pretty darn close it
doesn't turn reddish which I really like
because that I don't like reddish tint
to mine and then it's got this treat
thing which I really never used it's got
a little kind of like a lip gloss wand
supposedly to help you grow your lashes
I don't really use that one but this is
okay I just wish the spoolie was smaller
because it really ends up getting
everywhere and then trying to wipe it
but otherwise the the shape matches
perfect so if you're looking for a
cooler tone taupe this would be a great
product for you you know what I could do
I could literally I think I could just
cut this bully you guys think I might
try that why not right it's my product
but this is three dollars I think it's
pretty good another thing I've got is
the elf makeup mist and set this is not
bad it's not my favorite but I think
this is one that you could really it's
got all these vitamins and things so I
think it could could be comparable to
the urban decay b6 you can spray it on
your face before
and spray it on afterwards I would I
prefer to do it beforehand rather than
afterwards because I don't think it does
much afterwards for me however this is a
great one if you use like that tone
correcting powder I told you about
earlier that has a little bit of a
powdery look this is great for something
like that but I think in regards to
helping your makeup stay all day I don't
know how well this works I really
haven't tested it out enough to know to
be honest and then another thing I've
tried is the elf daily brush cleanser
right now I actually have this filled
with just alcohol to spot clean my
brushes but the formula before was okay
it really wasn't bad it got you know
it's a spot cleaner so it's not gonna
deep clean your brushes anyway so I felt
that it did its job pretty well I think
I'd still prefer to use alcohol just to
kill the germs which is what I'm using
this for now anyway because the nozzle
is really good so but I think it's worth
a shot if you don't have a spot cleaner
and you're wanting to try and keep up
with that I would give the elf one a try
it's three bucks now on to the brushes
the elf brushes I have so many I know
this video is so long but what else is
there you guys are you kidding me my
videos are always so long and oh well so
oh my goodness the elf stipple brushes
are the best I have the regular size and
the small and these are three dollars
from their studio line they are just
amazing they're great for if you have a
really pigmented blush to help to apply
it without using a heavy hand it really
helps you be light handed even if you're
not very good at it you know what I mean
and then the small one is great if you
want to contour with it or just for a
spot like concealer I mean there's so
much you can do with these I love them
and they're great for cream products as
well in fact that's the only way I apply
cream products is with these I also love
the elf complexion brush I use it
because of its shaped for blush actually
and I love it these are all three
dollars then the small tapered brush is
great for applying concealer powder for
contouring for highlight there's so much
you can do with this shape I love it and
then I also have the elf flawless
concealer brush and this is the one I
mentioned that I actually used to apply
the elf mineral eye brightener I use
this to apply it just cuz it's really
small and I love how soft these brushes
are and then I also have for eye brushes
from that same Studio line I have the
elf contour brush which is just a really
small crease brush
the elf flat eyeliner brush which I use
to apply powder to my under eye if I
want to just have powder eyeliner under
their eyeshadow I mean and then the elf
small smudge brush I use for my eyeliner
every single day every single day for
cream liner that is it's just for me
it's the perfect shape and size and I
just really like it and I've used it for
like a year and a half now and then one
more studio brush well kind of it's the
mascara and shadow shield
I bought this so that just because I
felt like you know it might be something
good to have I used it a couple times I
mean it shields and does its job but I
really don't use too many shadows that
have too much fall out if it has fall I
just don't use it because I don't like
it and I'll usually get rid of it but
it's good to have I guess I don't know I
don't find myself using it very often
that's what I'll say about that
and then there dollar brushes I also
love and that's their essential line so
all of these are a dollar I have the
professional smudge what is it the
smudge eye sponge it's just really small
it's a true sponge it's great for
smudging out things obviously this is
the elf blending eye brush another
crease brush I use every single day it's
a great shape and then this is the
flawless concealer brush or I mean the
professional concealer brush I used I
used to use this for eyeliner and then I
got the studio line one but this one's
okay I don't use it as often even though
it's a concealer brush I don't use a
print sealing but it'd be great for can
spot concealing it's really small that
would be great for that it's really what
it's intended for this is the elf smudge
brush and it's just a really small it's
an actual brush not a sponge it's just
really small and dense I really think
that's great for under-eye smudging and
then this I use all the time they're
they're basically their spoolie their
brow wand it's a dollar it's great it's
strong and I use it all the time for my
brows and then lastly the defining eye
brush I have a couple of these I love
the shape is just perfect for doing the
outer corner I love it so much and this
$1 Wow okay
those are all of the elf products that I
own if you have any questions about any
of them let me know down below like I
said elf products range anywhere from $1
to now some of them are getting a little
more expensive I don't know what their
highest product is but it used to just
be $6 but I think some of them are a
little pricier because I don't know
maybe it's more expensive for them to
make
I just love it the basics of it are that
they're essential line is usually a
dollar their studio line is usually
three dollars but some of their studio
products are five or six dollars they
also have their mineral line which hover
from like three to five dollars give or
take and then they're just random
products the brushes are the bomb like
I'm not for real their brushes are
amazing there's so many more than my eye
on I owned the elf powder brush the
studio that's really flat that's really
soft and dense but I actually gave it to
my mom because she needed one and I just
had that and I didn't use it as often
but it's a great one that I'll probably
rebuy but please let me know what other
elf products that you love because I'm
always wanting to buy more and try out
more so let me know down below what you
