my best and worst of elf I've done this
kind of a video like every year since I
started my channel and as elf releases
more and more products you know some of
their products get discontinued etc I've
tried a lot so I recently placed an
order with elf I did a haul maybe in
November or December I just went on
their website and went crazy in the new
section and I even went I think I went
through every single product on their
website which is a lot what you see in
stores from elf nothing compared to what
they offer online so they've had a lot
of new stuff some old loves of mine as
well that they still sell so I'm gonna
go through my best and the worst in my
opinion if you enjoyed this kind of a
video definitely give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you like let's go and get
into it I'm already out of breath I just
finished filming my Physicians Formula
best and worse as well and I have tons
of those products so if that video is up
I will link it below if not subscribe
and stay tuned because it will be up
soon but let's get into some elf so oh
my gosh let's start with something I was
surprised how much I liked and that is
their little eye shadow duos these are I
think they call them their best friend
duos this is in the shade t42 I have
gotten more compliments wearing this duo
then like I've ever gotten I remember my
friend Sara was in town and we went to
the mall and like the lady at Teavana
was at Ivana David's tea she was like I
love your eyeshadow I'm like thank you
and I'm thinking like what am i wearing
away it was just this it was just this
kind of champagne II colored shimmer and
here's the thing these are neat they
don't even swatch that well but they
really do look so yeah you can barely
see them they look so nice on the eyes I
think these colors especially if you're
near my skintone look like you hardly
tried but there's like a slight shimmer
and there's something about that that
really does look nice and this is not
something you know it's nothing like if
I compare this to like swatching any
other palette I have this does not
compare like it doesn't seem like it's
very nice but it just looks really nice
on the eyes I can't describe it this
other one I really like is called peach
squad and it's got like a
that kind of a peach color and then a
shimmery darker gold again it swatches a
little bit better than the other ones
but these look so pretty together you
could totally pair all four all four
these shades together if you wanted
whatever but really really inexpensive
of course and true elf style and I was
actually pretty impressed even though
upon first glance they don't seem very
nice now if you're wanting like a crazy
pack-a-punch color those are not gonna
be your best friend but if you just want
like a slight wash of something then
you'll like it I'm making it sound worse
but that I mean that genuinely is what
it is where are you decent amount of
this on my face today so I'll definitely
tell you what I'm wearing as we go so
continuing on the eye shadow I have
their mad format palette so there's
their original and then there's their
Mad format - so these are all matte
shadows I think these are right around
ten dollars actually really really nice
they're like I said all matte they
really did a good job getting a nice
range of colors again these don't swatch
like crazily amazing but they are so
nice on the eyes they blend the way you
want them to blend and so for me I'm
like we're such a swatch culture here in
the YouTube beauty community you know we
always look at swatch and say oh it
looks terrible
but really you're not necessarily
swatching these on your eyes maybe for a
lid shade you're you know literally
swatching it but for everything else
you're using a brush because that's what
brushes were intended for and I think
these apply so beautifully I think they
blend really well so this is kind of a
classic matte palette it's got deeper
lighter colors medium colors there Matt
for Matt to definitely has some more
color to it
so definitely has some of those warmer
shades if you're really into that but
there are enough really wearable shades
that you know you don't have to be
thrown off by like the purple and the
red because the rest of them are so
wearable I think you'd get more wear out
of this than you would think does that
make sense so I really I actually today
okay so on my eyes I'm wearing this
palette other than the shimmer
it's another elf product I'll talk about
in a second but I'm wearing in the
crease this kind of topi shade and the
I put some of the red in the outer
corner I used a little bit of this
peachy shade as well just to blend it
all together and then I have this kind
of cream shade on my brow bone so really
really impressed oh and I used this
brown on my lower lash line a little bit
to smudge out that black very very
impressive stuff for a pretty good price
point on my brows today this one
surprised me how much I liked it this is
the elf ultra precise brow pencil I have
an immediate berry berry thin totally
just like the Anasazi brow Wiz you guys
I've learned over the years after trying
a lot of brow products including the
Anasazi brow is there's nothing that
special about that anymore because
everyone's coming out with these thin
ones but also the consistency of that is
exactly the same as this like I don't
notice any difference about the blend
ability the creaminess they're the same
so I would totally totally repurchase
this this is what I used in my brows
today you can get really precise on like
the tail of your brow you can make it
look like a brush you could totally just
color it in and then the spoolie is nice
and small just like the Anasazi one and
it really pulls the color through your
brows I was very impressed with this
very very very impressed this is totally
something that when I use up I could see
myself buying again the shade medium
Brown is perfect for me it doesn't
really pull too warm it's not too dark
it's just right in between um something
I really really like from elf is their
glow lotion this is in the shade natural
no sorry natural glow lotion and it's
called brightening rose this is
something that really everyone let me
wipe these swatches off every brand is
coming out with a kind of glowy dewy
brightening kind of a primer or
moisturizer they're kind of the same
thing I really like this do I think this
is any better than like all the other
brands no I feel like all of them are
kind of doing the same thing I love what
all of them do but if you're looking for
one and you're already placing in elf
order or you see it in store I
absolutely would recommend this it looks
nice especially if you have normal to
dry skin I just put it all over and then
I put on you know you could put on a
primer on top I use it sometimes you
as my primer just as a moisturizing
primer and then put a foundation on top
and it really does a nice job of helping
your skin kind of glow from within
you'd be surprised like if you did your
half your face with it and half your
face without it you do notice a
difference but it's not so glowy that
you're like looking greasy now if you
have oily skin I don't know I don't
think this adds so much that it would
look super greasy but at the same time
if your skin is already predisposed to
kind of have that oil it might not look
as nice on your skin can I just tell you
what's on my lips it's not an elf
product that I want to tell you anyway
in case you don't see my Physicians
Formula video there are a lot of new
products from them that are amazing this
is one of them this is their the healthy
lip velvet finish and it's in the shade
vitamin beet this is the most
comfortable lip color ever it like dries
down but it shows a little transfer so
it's it feels like your lips like it's
so it's so soft I like keep looking in
the mirror here and I'm like I love this
stuff so definitely look out for this in
your wherever your store whatever store
sells Physicians Formula I actually
bought it on online on their website he
said okay then I take my hair down my
hair is kind of like you ever get a
headache from like wearing your hair up
and this is only like what I always call
some up and some down my mom got me in
that trend of client that but it's just
giving me a headache and I'm I was gonna
keep wearing it to the end and I'm like
I don't think I can make it that long
alright so continuing on some skincare
from them I really really like elf their
beauty shield line I really liked a lot
from that line but this is something
that really stood out this is their
vitamin C pollution prevention serum I
only have a little bit left I love
putting this on as like my first step on
my face in the morning before makeup it
sets into your it sinks into your face
really quickly but it's a nice vitamin C
serum I feel like it just kind of
brightens my skin and it gives something
good in my skin before I put foundation
all that kind of stuff on it that maybe
is not so good for your skin I love this
stuff and I love the idea that it's kind
of like you know those environmental
stressors that are out there that are
getting into your skin it's at least one
protective layer against that and I love
that about it I remember and I
probably mentioned this in video before
I had a like a makeup class I was taking
at in college I remember her saying you
never ever want to go outside period
with nothing on your face you need
something protecting your skin from the
environment whether that's the Sun
whether that's you know just the crap
that's in the air the pollution you
always need something as a barrier on
your face and so this I literally every
morning that I use this I think of her
saying that but I totally agree you know
the more I've learned about our skin the
more it's so true everything just gets
into there anyway another product from
ELF I really like kind of skin care is
there prep and hydrate balm I actually
use this today my concealer was looking
a little low it's still kind of looking
a little Ola and it's actually an elf
product I'm gonna talk about that did it
but sometimes I'll just grab a little
bit of this and push it into there it
depends on the concealer sometimes it
can kind of make the concealer move but
this is also just really nice for just
sticking all over your face as a quick
moisturizing layer before you start
putting on primer foundation etc that's
how I use it
elf used to have that one like Moisture
stick they might still sell it that's a
little bit better for like tapping into
that area this is not quite this is a
little bit maybe too hydrating and
that's why it moves it around a little
bit so a kind of it's like a good
product but a bad product is this elf I
don't even know what it's called I will
of course have these listed and linked
in the order I mentioned below but it's
kind of like a concealing powder and
it's in the shade banana it says it's
for deep tone but I mean it worked for
me I used another one of their products
this is like this little pyramid shaped
kind of diamond shaped sponge and I
actually dipped this into it and I liked
the sponge only for like setting your
under-eye I really did not like it for
anything else just because it's got that
really tight corner you can really get
into here's the thing this actually has
really nice coverage so if you're trying
to break your unpretty run dry this does
a fantastic job however it definitely
makes your under eye look older if
you've got any sort of like fine line
anything it's going to show
that and I'm looking in the mirror from
a foot and a half away and I can see my
fine lines because of this so something
to keep in mind
it definitely brightens but if you have
any issues in your under eye other than
just like you know the color wanting to
be brightened you will see it with this
so it's one of those things that I'm
like I'll probably eventually declutter
because I don't like that I don't want
to look older than I am I think I'd
rather be not as bright under there and
not look as old you know what I mean so
something to keep in mind it does its
job but it definitely has some drawbacks
I mean so like I said this sponge I
really have only used it for that I
tried it with my face I've tried it for
contour it just didn't do the job well
but for that it definitely does okay
I'll even use it dry sometimes and it's
fine do I think you need to run out and
buy this though nope so what is on my
eyes today is an old favorite it's the
elf like long-lasting lustrous shadow
and soirée kind of a creamy shadow it's
definitely got some glitter and shimmer
so I put it on top of a very white
primer just on my lid to make it stand
out a little bit more and I do think it
helped I just love this shade I love
that there's like glitter and shimmer in
it but it's suspended in the cream so it
doesn't there's never ever glitter
fallout that is awesome so they have a
couple of shades that this just happens
to be the only one I own because it was
just my favorite it was the one I reach
for all the time this is the second one
of these I've owned I tore through one
of them you do have to be careful if you
get too much of a Glock because it is
kind of a whipped cream II kind of a
feel if you get too much it'll kind of
pill up on your eye because it's just
too much so you do you know kind of
swirl it as if it's like a more like a
powder and it'll apply much more evenly
but I really really do like this but you
have to use I've learned a white primer
underneath and that's what really gets
the job done
I really like the NYX white eye primer
they have like the milk jumbo eye pencil
but also they have the pot that's a
white eye primer if you use a thin layer
of that just on the lid it looks perfect
really that works very well that's my
favorite way to apply any bolder colored
shadow I mean this isn't super bold next
up speaking of eye primers one that I
just wanted more from was the elf pro
eyeshadow primer
I loved the kind of more in
dusty'll tube i don't know why i was
talking about that in the hall - i don't
know why i like that
it's kind of a creamy definitely a very
soft velvety feel to it when you blend
it in but that's about it it really does
not hold shadow it doesn't have that
tackiness you need it was just kind of
an odd primer I feel like this would
almost be a better face primer than it
would I prime Irby cuz with shadow you
really needed to stay exactly where you
put it and well I guess that's true for
anything regardless I just wasn't
impressed with the longevity of it I
felt like it really didn't do much it I
don't know it just it didn't work for me
and I usually can use most eyeprimer
with no problem and this is one that I
just wasn't impressed with I really have
not felt found an elf eye primer that
I've really fallen in love it oh another
thing just kind of a fun when I want to
throw in their elf i refresh a really
cooling kind of a I don't even know
what's in it but it just feels really
nice on the eye again do I think it's
having long-term skincare benefits to my
under-eye region no but does it feel
really nice in the morning to wake you
up yes and that's why I like it it helps
me feel more awake whether it's actually
doing anything or not probably not it's
probably a placebo effect but I really
like the feel of it and so I'm like
that's right it's it's like it's like
giving your head a massage you have a
headache is it giving you a long-term
benefit no but does it feel good in the
moment yeah that's why we do it so same
thing now this is actually a really good
example Jessica good job next up
something I'm wearing on my brow bone
today these are the elf targeted natural
glow sticks I have two shades I have
fresh morning dew which is like a kind
of clear I don't even want to say white
it really is more like clear it looks
white and then there's a more pinkish
shoe this is pink pearl glow this one
definitely is a little more pigment to
it this I mean you could put it like on
the tip of your nose here I'll put a
little bit and just kind of blend it in
you could put it as like a highlight I
literally took it and just put it right
on my brow bone I can put a little more
on and just kind of blended it in that
way and I feel like it's just such an
easy it blends so well that it's perfect
for that and that's how I found myself
reaching for this the most versus you
know kind of drawing that line I do
think it looks okay like that I just
like it bad
for those kinds of regions because like
I said it's a targeted highlighting
stick so it's perfect for that I have
would like I said recommend the pink
pearl glow over the clear one the clear
- really just looks like a gloss I don't
think it will give the effect that you
want it to unless you're wanting more of
a glossy look like maybe you just want
glossy lids I don't know I've never
tried it that way I don't know if that
would actually give the effect you want
or not but yeah so I the clear one kind
of a dud but this one I definitely
really liked for those an old favorite
I'm gonna mention just really quickly
the elf studio blushes I like all of
them but my favorite is mellow mauve I
bought a new one that's what's on my
cheeks today it's just a very standard
kind of peachy pink blush there's not
really any shimmer or glitter it's got
kind of a satiny finish but not really
it's more matte but you if you look at
it closely you can kind of see a little
bit of shimmer but it really doesn't
show up like that on the cheeks what
you're seeing is my highlight I love
this blush I love this color it's such a
standard like really put together blush
color so it's one that I could reach for
every day and be satisfied so definitely
one the whole line is really nice very
pigmented I guess I could swatch it for
you huh very pigmented really really
nice but this is just happens to be my
favorite color they stay on all day long
another old favorite I'll just mentioned
briefly cuz I talk about it a lot is the
elf flawless finish foundation I
travelled with on our little baby moon
we vlogged on our vlog channel which i
will link below we've logged we were at
Disney World that we went on a cruise
then we went back to Disney World this
is the only foundation I brought and I
just love this stuff this is in the
shade porcelain I actually think it
might weirdly be a little bit too dark
for me right now as I was putting it on
I was kind of seeing that on my go
anyway but it's got SPF of 15 it's oil
free I just love this stuff it gives
perfect medium to full coverage stays on
all day it looks really nice on the skin
I just I adore it I love that it's got a
pump another product the elf hydrating
primer I love this stuff it's absolutely
on par it's got a pump it's absolutely
on par with every other hydrating primer
I've ever used
I think this one does kind of have a leg
up in a way though because it's
hydrating but it also has that kind of
velvety feel so it does both I feel like
a
of hydrating primers are just hydrating
but they don't necessarily hold on to
your foundation a lot this one does both
and that's why I'm so surprised more
people don't talk about it it's it
really is kind of in a world of its own
and I think that's really neat so
definitely they elf sells a lot of
different primers this is my favorite
one
for exactly the reasons I just stated
another quick mention the makeup
removing pen I mentioned every year when
I do this video I used it to clean up
wing the liner really quickly it's
awesome it's couple bucks I just every
few months I just replace it and a lot
of you guys have asked how I keep it
clean honestly I just you know I used it
to clean it up and then like with a rag
or whatever you have with you like I
always have a different rag that I just
wash all that I have a big I just bought
a big old pack of rags basically I just
wipe it off and it usually comes right
off so if you do it pretty quickly most
of it will come off and it'll last
longer that way and you can also pull it
out and turn it around and get a little
more use it's not the chisel tip but
it'll still work it still has that
makeup remover kind of solution in it so
love this stuff I've bought that a
million times another thing I use from
time to time is their acne fighting Joe
ain't used it in a while now that I'm
pregnant salicylic acid I'm I don't know
with anything like that I'm a little bit
more leery as I'm learning more and I've
got a lot to learn about what to use and
not to use but I don't really use this
right now but it's just a quick
salicylic acid treatment for zits if
that works well for you I mean it's you
know it is what it is it's not a super
high concentration but just a quick
thing especially if you're traveling you
want to have something it's perfect
other things I've loved over the years
this is their cream blush and bronzer
duo this is amazing honestly the way I
apply it I'll just you can use a stipple
brush I'll even use just like a beauty
sponge any Beauty sponge dip it like
especially in the bronzer that's my
favorite side and I'll just dip it in
there lightly and then just Pat that
bronzer into the bronzer II areas in my
face looks flawless stays on all day
it's amazing and it's surprisingly easy
don't be intimidated because I was for
the longest time buy cream products
until I started just using my beauty
sponge for everything it's so much
easier it's so much more foolproof it
looks so much more natural on the skin
instead of like a powder it's easier to
blend together and then it sets and
you're done it lush I don't use as much
it's quite pigmented maybe a little bit
too much so I wish this bronzer came in
like a full pan I would love that
please else make that please I remember
being on like an elf I went on one brand
trip with them and I remember talking to
one of the like main people there and I
said hey I have an idea can we take your
duos that you guys make like all your
blush bronzers can we take the bronzers
and make a full pan of bronzer kind of
reminiscent of like the NARS you know
the NARS bronzers are like that full pan
I was like kid we do that like can you
guys do that I would love that
because I love their blushes but I like
having them separate I don't know why I
don't like things together
I like blushes separate bronzers
separate I'm weird like that and I
wanted like their bronzers but I want a
full pan of it like how hard would that
be I was like you could charge like 6 ba
like I'm telling them everything I think
they should do they're like oh I like
that idea and then they never did it I'm
like okay well I think it's an awesome
idea same anyway so this is actually
they're a matte blush duo totally a
bronzer for me and then this I mean it's
in soft and subtle this I don't really
use for anything it's like an orange e
light color it could work if you have a
deeper more yellow skin tone maybe but I
do like this kind of bronzer shade again
they're not swatching very well it is
very subtle but I do like putting this
just it's like my blush bronzer like
I'll grab this and just do that I don't
need both a bronzer and blush when I use
it do I think you need to run out and
buy this no I think it's kind of a weird
color combination to be quite candid
something that I surprised it well this
is more of a meth product this is their
waterproof gel eyeliner pencil it can
look really black but sometimes like
it'll get too smudgy so if you want a
more smudgy black liner I think you'd
like it but if you're trying to be more
precise it's kind of difficult with this
because it's not it's one you sharpen
but it's got that really hard edge that
I feel like no sharpener works very well
with if you have a recommendation it can
be really black but sometimes like out
like for example today
I tried to use it's a tight line and I
just couldn't get it to like stick on my
eyelid it was really odd but then when i
swatched on my hand it looks super black
so it's just kind of a matte product I
think it's actually pretty good but just
sometimes when I'll use it I'm like huh
like it's not doing exactly what I want
it to do so I wouldn't say stay away
from it because I do think it's pretty
darn black but it's just kind of
wishy-washy I guess product I did really
like this is their elf oh my gosh it
just says pretty pink please and it
doesn't say at all what it is it's just
kind of like a clear gloss but it's got
a little tint to it it's just
comfortable do I think it's something
you need to run out and buy no I mean
it's just kind of a tinted gloss but if
that's what you're looking for go for it
now you have to like this kind of an
applicator too and I know a lot of
people like it some people don't
it is what it is but it really ends up
coming more as the clear gloss with a
slight tint it's okay so I like it but
I'm not gonna like go out and buy more
colors because they wouldn't be that
different and I don't feel that strongly
about it but one I do feel strongly
about is they're like lip oils this is a
naked kiss it's my favorite one these
just have this really nice kind of oily
feel to them they end up I mean they
don't swatch pretty because they really
are more of a tint in oil so they don't
look super even when you do that but
when you put it on your lips and kind of
rub your lips together it's just such a
comfortable feel way more comfortable
than a standard gloss and I feel like
it's doing something a little bit better
for my lips than a standard gloss so
that's why I would really recommend any
of their lip oils so next up is this
little sculpting silk eyeshadow trio
this is in rows day all day I literally
have like three makeup products from
three different brands that are called
Rose day all day I think that's kind of
funny like I think what and Wilde had
one this is one and the Physicians
Formula has one called Rose day all day
and they're all very different products
like the Physicians Formula one cut is
called Rose day all day and it's a serum
you know it's just funny anyway
beautiful really really good quality
shadows now you could totally get a
complete look out of this I've worn this
look with like the shimmer on the lid
this in the outer corner and liner and
then the
kind of all throughout the crease to
blend it all together it's really pretty
so if you found a trio that you really
were drawn to I would say definitely I
think that this formula might be nicer
than like they're mad format formula
which is kind of interesting really
really impressive a dud this is the elf
volume plumping mascara guys I'm still
on the hunt it just didn't do anything
like I felt like it kind of clumped them
together and that was the volumizing
portion of it but it didn't look
flattering like I don't mind lashes
looking a little bit clump not clumpy
but you know thick and black like it's
obvious that I'm wearing mascara I don't
mind that but I just felt like this kind
of clumped them all together and it
added a little volume but not in the way
I like so again just kind of
underwhelmed by it I know a lot of you
guys recommended like the mineral one
I'll have to try that one soon there are
holographic duo's I just didn't like
some people really like these they sent
me these and then I think I bought one
so I had like two of one of these shades
they might swatch okay but they just
don't look nice on my skin like they
looked kind of powdery they looked very
fake I mean obviously all highlighter is
fake so that was sirens call this is
Blue Lagoon I just felt like these were
kind of powdery and cheap feeling this
one is mermaid tail I don't know I just
was underwhelmed if you're like dying to
try this kind of maybe but it was just
okay hey that kind of created a rainbow
effect oh that's pretty
another product that I really like now
this is really oily and of course the
name of it's not on there just as
illuminating really oily highlight and
so you have to put it on underneath your
foundation and so I really love the way
this looks is so pretty I've tried to
kind of tap it on top here let me try
and it will kind of work but sometimes
it can mess with the foundation
underneath it and that's when I'm like
ah but like if I really blend it out and
then get a little bit and tap it on it
will work it's really pretty
it really is oh geez but it can look
like a lot if you're not careful unless
that's what you want so it's a really
pretty one I really like it but I have
to be really like pink
about how I use it and that makes me
feel like but I do I think it's gorgeous
on so those are all of the products my
best and worse I've certainly tried more
over the years but I do declutter a lot
just if I'm not using or if I just fell
in about it I hope that you enjoyed this
kind of video if you did definitely give
it a thumbs up and subscribe if you
would and I'll see you guys next time
