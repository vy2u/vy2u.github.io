going to be reviewing the brand new elf
contour palette now this is a palette
that is only $6 on elfs website I
haven't seen in any stores near me but
it's definitely on their site and I'm on
it right this second and it's in stock I
know things like this tend to go out of
stock really quick but it is in stock
right now as I'm filming this this has
four different shades to contour slash
bronzy shades and then two highlighting
shades so let's go ahead and get into
the demo of how I used it today I use
every single shade in here today on my
face and then we'll get into the pros
and cons of this product so let's go
ahead and dig into this palette and see
how I've been using it so first I'm
going to start with this great toned
powder right here I'm going to use this
as a contour and I'm using this brush
that's kind of a medium sized powder
brush from furless and I'm just going to
get plenty on there and I'm just going
to focus it right where I typically
would just to about where your brow bone
ends just that little chunk right there
and just kind of back-and-forth and you
see it really is a nice tone for a
contour you always want that gray tone
and it's so hard to find if you are a
little bit lighter like I am it's hard
to find one that's not too deep that it
makes you look like you're on stage like
stage makeup so I'm going to get a
little bit more focused right at my
hairline there we go and just kind of
blend it down a little bit so that's
what I'm going to do let's do the other
side now I'm going to take a brush has
nothing on it and kind of blend it a
little bit now I'm going to use some
more bronzy color with like a really
thick almost kabuki type brush this is
for Morpheus there em 219 I bought it on
HauteLook for really cheap more fees on
there all the time and people I know
everyone's like morphe crazy which I'm
not I'm not really here they're on them
but they're on HauteLook all the time
for really cheap so I just got plenty
I'm kind of tapping it off and I'm just
going to bronze up the upper areas of my
face and I'm going to get some more just
anywhere that someone naturally hit then
I'm kind of taking it down into that
contour to make it look like it's all
one piece in a way and I'm kind of
sloppy about it because if I'm needing
to look a little bit Tanner I mean it
doesn't have to be perfect and I'm just
kind of going back into that and buffing
that in and even just a little bit down
here just like the XS I don't really go
crazy with it um now let's go into the
highlighting part of it I'm using a
smaller brush from furless could be
anything else sells amazing ones I just
grabbed this one it's a lot smaller and
I'm going to use this yellow tone one
here for setting my under eye concealer
I'm trying out a new concealer it's the
Maybelline master conceal and it looks
really really oily and it's driving me
bonkers so I'm hoping this yellow tone
is really great for brightening your
under eye and it's really really there's
a lot that comes out so I always tap it
off but I'm just going to kind of push
it into that area and then buff back and
forth and I'm going to take it up a
little bit on my cheek bone and get some
more for my other eye it's just a really
oily concealer I don't know how I feel
about that but I love this powder for
setting it because again not only does
it kind of mattify that area but it
serves to add a little bit more coverage
as well so I already look so much more
put together does kick up a lot of
powder now I'm going to use I'm going to
kind of wipe off that excess on that
same brush because I like the shape of
this brush then I'm going to use the
white tone to actually highlight this
area but before I do that I'm going to
put on a blush so this is the order I
like to do things so the blush I'm going
to use is just one from NYX called soft
spoke and it's a beautiful one these are
really inexpensive and I'm using a real
techniques blush brush and I'm just
going to get some on tap off the extra
and just put it right at the apples of
my cheeks again this is a nice color
because you can't really screw it up if
you're not good at like the placement of
your blush you just you can't really
screw it up I need a little bit more
since it is a lighter color I love the
tone of this blush just like a nice
flush so now I'm going to take that
white tone in there to sir
a highlight on that same small brush
definitely want to tap off the excess of
this and I'm just focusing right at the
top of my cheekbones and you can already
see the glow it just added Wow and I'm
going to bring it up just a little bit
up here right above my brow kind of get
a little bit more for the other side oh
my gosh this is so beautiful
um and if you wanted I mean this is a
really shimmery one you could bring it
down here or up there in fact you could
take the yellow tone one that's not
shimmery that I used to set the
under-eye and brighten this area a
little bit if you wanted that's kind of
a powder highlight and it also again
serves to mattify you could bring it
down your nose on your philtrum there
and you could really go crazy and take
the contour shade with smaller brushes
and contour your nose or all those other
areas you can contour but for everyday I
mean I don't even come for every day but
if you were wanting to I think this is
perfect for what you need it for it does
pick up a lot of powder but I love the
way it naturally makes your skin look
it's just more defined but it's nothing
over the top I really really can't
believe this is six dollars so obviously
I really like this product I can't
believe that for six dollars you can get
four different powders that can do so
much for your face and make you look so
much more put together without spending
like $50 there are so many contour kits
out there right now that are so
expensive for the exact same thing is
this and some of them aren't even as
nice
I did a dupe video for the honest Asya
contour kit with this other one that was
like I think $20 or 25 won I got it
and I can link that below but honestly
this is even better and it's way cheaper
I'm just I love it so one of the big
bonuses the packaging is simple you know
elf always says like the really sleek
black packaging but from what I have
heard you can pop these little babies
out and like interchange them they have
blush palettes and foundation palettes
and a bronzer palette and I've got a lot
of those different ones yes you can so
gives you two off push up on the bottom
it pops right out so you could literally
make your own like if I wanted to just
take maybe the contour shade
eight and then the highlight shades and
then I wanted to trade out the bronzer
for something I could put in a blush or
whatever I think that is absolutely
genius of them so the product the
packaging is a huge plus this doesn't
have any noticeable smell the texture of
all of them I did mention that it does
kick up a lot of dust but they're all
crazy pigmented I mean crazy pigmented
and here's kind of like swatches of them
right there they're beautiful you guys
they feel so high-end and so kind of
buttery especially to highlight shades
so I have been wearing this this past
week a lot and it's really hot it's
summertime and it stays put now I don't
think that like I put it on at like 8:30
yesterday morning and I was working in
my classroom and all this other stuff by
the time I would say about 8:00 p.m.
rolled around it wasn't you couldn't
really see the contour as well so I
wouldn't say that it'll last you know 16
hours and you never need to touch it up
but if you know that you're going out at
night you might want to touch it up but
I would say that would be true for any
contouring palette I've ever used none
of them seem to last like 20 hours or
whatever so I don't really mind that as
much but it is something worth knowing
for applying these I don't think it
really matters what brushes you use I've
used every time that I own I've used
elfs brushes which are amazing more
expensive brushes Sigma brushes Mac
brushes it doesn't matter they all apply
beautifully and what I like about these
is you can really build them to be a lot
deeper if you want it to be a lot more
noticeable whereas if you want it to
just look really natural you can do that
as well like I said you can buy this on
elf what is the eyes lips face comm I
haven't seen it in any stores I don't
know if they eventually will be but I
have a feeling these will sell out fast
they had apparently they had an ambient
like highlighting palette I didn't even
know about without country and I came
back and they're sold out I'm like how
why did this happen so I'm dying to get
my hands on this ambient palette that
they supposedly had because oh my gosh
if it's a dupe for the hourglass one
I'll lose my mind so I'll usually have
sales like they'll have the studio which
this is part of their studio line
50% on all the studio products or just
40% site-wide or free shipping spend 20
got I mean they constantly got some sort
of sale going on so definitely look it
up overall would I recommend this
obviously I would recommend this this
thing is incredible so hopefully this
video was helpful or enjoyable for you
