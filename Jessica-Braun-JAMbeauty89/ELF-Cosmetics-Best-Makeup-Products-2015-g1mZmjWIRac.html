going to bring you a video all about elf
you guys know I love elf so thinking
much and so I'm going to talk about some
of my absolute favorite products in this
video I've done best and worst elf
videos in the past I can link below
where I mentioned different products but
right now here in 2015 these are the
products that I still have in my
collection that I'm using currently that
I really really like and I wanted to
share with you guys so let's go ahead
and get into it
so the first thing I'm going to mention
you guys is this lipstick that I'm
actually wearing right now they're moist
rising lipsticks are one of my favorite
lines that they have the shade I'm
wearing is called pink minx and it's
kind of a nice warm toned pink but it's
really really creamy it truly is
moisturizing the downside is that you
can see on mine mine kind of broke a
little bit because it's so so soft so I
have to be really careful with this now
in all fairness I have a bare minerals
lipstick which is really expensive and
it broke the first time I use it as well
because it's so moisturizing so I don't
necessarily think that's just because
elf is cheap I think very very
moisturizing lipsticks might have more
of a tendency to do that
now that hasn't helped with any other
alphabets that I've used in the past
including the other moisturizing
lipstick so I think it might just be a
fluke but the reality is I love this
color I love the formula it's so
comfortable on the lips and it just mmm
like every time I put this on I feel
like it's like most truly actually
moisturizing and it's just such a nice
shade and so I had to mention this one
in this video the other elf lip products
I'm going to mention this video are
they're matte lip colors I know too that
are kind of my Holy Grail favorite ones
now before you even get there the matte
line I would say is not 100% map it's
probably like 80% matte because it does
have kind of
to it that leans a little more satin
than completely mad but it's still close
enough where it's so moisturizes enough
I just I really like these so this one
is in the shade wine and I almost wore
this with today I was so torn
but it's this gorgeous truly wine color
but it's a little bit lighter than I
think I would typically think of like a
merlot just a little bit lighter more
berry toned
I love this in the other shade that I
love is called praline or prolly and if
you're from New Orleans but it says
gorgeous kind of nude but it's more of a
brown tone and I've worn this when I've
gone out to brunch and I've worn it out
for coffee it makes me think of coffee
and dessert which maybe that's why I
wore it but I really really like just I
don't typically go for those kind of
brown shades at all but for some reason
I really felt drawn to this and so I
wear it a lot and one little fun tidbit
I've actually done a review and swatches
of all the ones I have in this line I
have a lot of them but the bottom part
comes out and there's a little sharpener
in it also I have to tell you because
this blew my mind in the moisturizing
lipsticks and I think any of the elf
ones that have a color swatch in the
bottom if you pull it out it's actually
like a little gloss or like a little bit
of the lipstick how freaking crazy is
that now that means it's like true to
form that it's actually the color so I
think they just smushed some of the
lipstick down there but I thought that
just blew my mind so if you have one
check it I didn't know for like two
years that that was down there another
favorite is another thing I'm wearing
today I tried to wear as many of these
as possible this is the HD lifting
concealer and I have it in the shade
fair and it's just a kind of shorter
concealer with a doe foot applicator and
the reason I like this is because when I
blend it whether I'm blending it with my
finger or with a brush or a Beauty
Blender it blends away beautifully but
it actually has coverage and like I said
I'm wearing it today and this shade fair
if you're thinking about getting it it's
almost like a I don't know it's almost
like a gray toned yellow it's really
bizarre but for me at least with my skin
type it works really really well now I
do think it does have a little bit of
doing this too it's not
Takeo but it is a little bit more
moisturizing and dewy so if you know
that you have dry under eyes you love
this I think if you have a really oily
under eye area you might not like it as
much but I would still say give it a
shot because the coverage is beautiful
and it just feels so nice when I put it
on this is one of my favorite products
ever out of any brand this is their
contour palette this oh my gosh
it comes with four shades this contour
shade right here is so similar to my
really expensive high-end Kevin o Kwan
sculpting powder and medium it's so
similar it's just got this kind of
grayish Brown and it's perfect I used it
today for contouring and even really
kind of bronzing up the face there's
also more of a warm tone one right there
if you'd prefer that but then it also
has these kind of highlighting shades I
use this yellow one all the time to set
my under eye I used it today actually
just to set this area and my nose to
kind of lighten that area but also to
set it instead of any other powder this
yellow one is a really nice highlight
too I would say I use these two shades
more than I use these two I use these
two all the time I kind of wish they
would just come out with a duo of just
these two shades because then I could
travel with it a little easier because
this is just a little big for what I
would prefer to travel with another
product is their contouring blush and
bronzing cream now I am I don't really
like cream products when it comes to
blush bronzer and stuff but this one
blows me away every time I use it
because not only is it insanely
pigmented but it actually stays on like
I think the reason so many of us don't
like cream products is because they just
don't last you have to put a powder on
top of it it's like well then why even
do the the cream step because I feel
like some of the powders would last all
day on their own so this stuff though
every time I've ever used it stays on
all day I'll typically use a stipple
brush elf
has a really nice stipple brush - dirty
it's in the bathroom right now but they
have a really nice dimpled brush like a
larger one and then a smaller one so you
can use this kind of dab it in there
and dab it on your cheeks and then blend
it in absolutely beautiful I I was blown
away by this another product I really
really liked is there this is their
baked blush but it's clearly a highlight
shade and it's called pink tastic I've
mentioned this before on my channel in
my top five highlighter video this is
like it's spectacular I know I can't
think of another word for it it's this
unbelievable you can see it from a mile
away highlighter you do have to use a
light hand with it but I'm wearing it
today and I think it just adds such a
nice glow and for what I think this
one's three dollars it's it's just as
good as and in fact I'll compare it I
have the Mac soft and gentle here which
is like a cult favorite highlighter
and I want to compare it to this oh my
gosh look how close they are
now the Mac soft and gentle I think is a
little more yellow than this one is but
it would kind of depend on what you
prefer but they're so close and the
sheen is the same they both blend
beautifully and they look beautiful in
the light I love both of them
but I found myself reaching for this one
more than my Mac one so take that for
what it's worth I think that's kind of a
big deal another product I really like
that I'm wearing today is their eye
brightener it's a mineral product of
theirs just in this little pot and it's
in the shade buff and this reminds me of
my bare minerals well rested powder it's
kind of got a yellow tint to it
and a crazy amount of coverage for a
powder umm but you can see there how
light it is
and so it's just incredibly brightening
in that area you can just use a brush to
kind of buff it there and then even out
you could even use it to highlight this
area but I used on my under eye all the
time and it's just it makes me look so
much more rested when I'm getting up in
the morning to teach you know I'm tired
and it's early and I'm getting ready
quickly and this is something that's
become a go-to for me to just grab and
throw on over my concealer to a make
sure that the concealer lasts a longer
amount of time but also to just brighten
that area so I'm actually wearing elf
eyeshadows on my
right now I'm going to mention two
different palettes of theirs these are
their prism eyeshadows and then this
palette is called sunset and I love
these shades they're just these gorgeous
kind of worn tone yellows and bronzes
this purple I don't really use but the
rest of them I do today I'm wearing this
shade right here on my lid and it's just
this gorgeous oh my gosh kind of amber
colored eye shadow I threw a little bit
of the white shade on top of it I'll put
it to the side of it though these are so
freakin soft so pigmented they last all
day
you do need a primer with them just to
make sure that the glittery part of it
doesn't fall down here but I think as
long as you've got a primer elf has a
pretty good glitter primer but any of
their eyeshadow primers are pretty good
you could use any of them with this and
it'll last all day I love it
but then I kind of paired those shiny
glittery shades with their mad format
palette and this one has ten shades and
they are all matte which is so hard to
find in the drugstore especially for a
decent price and they're just so
wearable they're so creamy they have all
the shades you'd really need for a
complete look and these are some of the
shades I'm wearing today it's hard to
see these are lighter colors so it's
really I don't know why I swatch like
the nude colors but they're so
unbelievably gorgeous this is one of the
Browns let me get like this darker
almost black shade they're gorgeous if
you've been looking to try a map how but
you don't want to spend like $50 over on
an urban decay palette or even like the
Sonia Kashuk matte palette that's been
out for a while it's like $20 I think
it's called their ion neutral palette
it's still like $20 so if you'd rather
save a little bit of money this one is
amazing it stays all day again I always
use a primer even if whether it's elf or
to face urban decay I always use a
primer so I would suggest doing this
thing the last thing I'm going to
mention is their smudge pot line these
are amazing I've done a whole video just
on
the different ones I have with swatches
and showing me applying them this one is
called back to basics and it's kind of a
favorite of mine I have it underneath my
lid shadow today and it's just this
really pretty kind of bronzy shade you
can see it there it's so shimmery and
beautiful but these do not budge when
you put them on you can wear these just
alone or under shadow they just stay put
and they're so beautiful
now I will say some of them aren't as
good as others so um and I can't think
of any off the top of my head but I know
some of the lighter ones like there was
a light pink one I've already gotten rid
of it but there was a light pink one
that was like pretty sheer and kind of
patchy that was the only one out of all
that I tried that wasn't as great but
all the rest that I've tried and I've
tried a lot of them aren't amazing so
they're definitely worth the money I
would wear these the same rate I wear my
Mac Paint Pots they're just as good
they're a little bit fluffier and like
more whipped if you will so they're not
quite the same but I love them so those
are all of the elf products I'm going to
mention today I review a lot of elf on
my channel so if you know that's
something you're interested in please
subscribe I'd love to have you as part
of our GM Beauty 89 family or my jammers
as I called them I'm like the only one
that calls in that like no one else
anyway I am so glad you watched my video
and I will catch you guys in my next one
