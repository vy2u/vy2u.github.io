excited for this video so one thing that
I've kind of learned I was gonna say I
haven't told you what you already know
this video is you clicked on you know
what it is the title on this under
anyway um I've kind of learned when I
did my video about like my favorite
videos on YouTube to watch my least
favorite I read every single comment and
I thought it's kind of amazing how how
many kindred spirits we have here on
YouTube you know what I mean like we all
kind of feel the same way and one thing
that I was like yeah I read a lot of
people saying you know what happened to
like normal halls like everyone does the
PR halls now not everyone a lot of
people do and some people love them some
people don't that's your pre you know it
is what it is
but it's so true that so many youtubers
have stopped doing like genuine halls
and like when I before I even started my
channel one of my favorite videos watch
for just straight-up halls like elf
halls Ulta house for us and it's not to
say that people aren't doing them like I
do that lots of people do them but it's
so true that a lot of times these halls
are really just things they were sent in
PR so someone might call it an alcohol
but it was just a bunch of stuff that
they sent them to try you know what I
mean um not that there's anything wrong
with that I mean obviously I get PR and
I okay I mean there's that anyway the
point of this is I got on else website I
bought a whole bunch of new stuff it
took every I ordered this stuff like
forgetting feels like a million years
ago finally got here stuff that I had no
idea they sold I don't know if they were
new a lot of this is new stuff and then
some of it I'm like how long have they
been selling this why didn't I already
talk about this so I was just like going
crazy spent way too much money I'm glad
it doesn't say how much I spent cuz it
was a while ago and I've already
forgotten that's okay Jess it's your job
I mean it is but don't know cover your
coffee chest all right okay let's go ed
and get into it so if you enjoy this
kind of video and now that I've already
blabbering on about everything else
definitely subscribe hit the thumbs up
let's go and get into it alright first
things first
have you wanted a new brush holder and I
knew they had these in black I haven't
opened these yet like the little guys so
please know that any time I do hauls Oh
anytime I do halt I do halt updates so
if you stay tuned in about a month after
I tried these all out I will do an
update let you guys know like okay
here's how I felt about them here's what
wasn't worth it here's what was worth it
am I getting rid of any of it you know
what I mean that kind of stuff so stay
tuned I promise I will give you my
reviews and thoughts on these after I've
actually tried them for a while so this
is more for just like what does ELF sell
what's new there if you had a coupon you
want to use it or you know whatever so I
saw that they had white ones now on one
side you can barely see it it says elf
play beautifully on the other side it's
blank and I like that not that I have
anything against elf but like I don't
necessarily want it like advertised elf
all day long so I thought that was so
cool I loved how it was split up and
right now I just have been using this
like little ceramic cup it's like a
flower pot but the bottom of it since it
is ceramic rose just because it is
ceramic
I felt like it kept scraping the top of
my desk and stuff and I'm like look so
this is just like a nice rubbery plastic
I figure that's perfect so I'm just kind
of excited to have a little bit more
room I don't these are just the brushes
I'm using currently that are dirty I
have a lot more brushes put away but
anyway very excited to have this and
it's white hefty classic I know I mean
it's still plastic but alright I also
got some makeup bags that I thought were
really interesting so I'm so excited to
see these in person
this is their I'll have everything
linked cuz none of them have names but
it was just like a little brush holder I
mean it's for normal-sized brushes but I
loved this because I do travel a lot and
for me I'm like I never know how to pack
my brushes kiss are you some one of
those giant brush cups I'm like okay
this is taking up way too much room in
my luggage and I don't need that much
room for brushes so this was perfect
because it's actually pretty thin and
small I could definitely fit all the
brushes I need to travel with it as long
as I like kind of alternate which side
has the brush that way throughout he is
I know a lot of people like oh it's so
bad for your brush don't like my brushes
will survive and if they don't well I
can replace you know it's not that deep
I thought this was perfect I thought the
gold was just kind of pretty it was
simple it would serve the exact purpose
I need it for and it I'm thinking about
all these other like like brush rolls I
have I can just get rid of I don't need
them because
it's gonna replace them all I love that
I love when I can get rid of a bunch of
stuff and replace it with one thing that
solves the problem that you guys love
it's a very good deal all right I also
got another one however as I said oh I
just got one that'll solve my problem
well I bought two but it's now
remembered but this one was so weird
okay look at this it's clear which I
don't love it but it's a like vertical
brush storage I mean you're not gonna be
sitting it up but the idea is that the
handles can all fit down here and then
where it's all kind of flaring out all
the brushes can fit there isn't that
genius what an inventive idea I mean I'm
sure elf didn't invent the idea well
maybe they did so I thought this is so
freaking cool so I'm gonna try them both
out when I do that hall update I'll let
you guys know which one do I think is
better for that purpose
we're traveling here really really soon
up to Chicago where I used to live I
love it there and we always do it kind
of at the holidays so I
well when I'm packing I guess I'll have
to pick which one I want to use but I'll
try them both out and kind of give you
an idea I think those are so cool bought
another elf crease brush it's such an
amazing brush for just getting detail
work in the crease without getting the
shadow everywhere this would be now the
fifth one that's insane I love this
brush so much I also picked up their
makeup remover cleansing cloths they had
this 2-pack I think it was a little bit
better of a deal to buy this then you
know I don't use this for my face I use
it first watches when I'm filming so and
even when I'm getting ready so if you're
one of those people that you're not a
youtube or anything but you are
swatching things just cuz you like to
play with makeup or you like when you're
getting ready in the morning you like to
use something to like wipe your hands
off whatever these are great you can
also use baby wipes but I like them I
don't think they're anything special but
I thought well if I'm placing this order
and I'm getting low on makeup removing
class I might as well buy the elf ones I
will say though the packaging totally
looks like the matte packaging which i
think is just kind of cool isn't that
dumb all right next thing I wanted to
try was this elf multi faceted Perfector
sponge it's kind of in this like diamond
shape I try the elf sponges and I've
never really liked any of them you know
so why Versailles grossed out money
there's nothing wrong with it it's like
a white felt part on the bottom I am
very curious let me go get this wet
let's see like if it gets big oh my gosh
it smells like a Christmas tree in here
because I have a like balsam fir you
know that kind of a tart melting in that
and I have like a candle called Oh
Christmas tree it's from like Target if
I can find it I'll link it do they sell
their candles on my own anyway it smells
amazing in here
it did get bigger it's still kind of
dense which is not necessarily always a
bad thing it is crazy how close you can
get to your I mean like crazy so I am
intrigued to try this I'm not big on
like baking and things like that but
even just for blending out concealer I'm
just curious so I will definitely let
you know how this is I think the shape
is cool as heck and if you wanted to
have it on your thing you can actually
stand whereas most sponges roll all
around so that's kind of cool next thing
oh another brush this is a detail crease
brush so I bought this and this was one
of those parks I was like how long have
they been selling this is this new I
think it does say new it's just a bit
smaller than the regular crease brush so
it's really detailed so I figure for
outer corner work perfect you it's
almost low enough that you could even do
like a little inner corner it might be a
little bit too big for that but I
thought how awesome again brushes like
this make you look like you know what
you're doing because when you're not a
makeup artist like me but you just love
makeup you know it's it can be so hard
to do like those little things and so
the second I started realizing like Matt
Jessica you just need to get more
detailed brushes it really changed the
game for me and this is awesome because
it's just rounded it's not like you have
to get it on just one side and Pat it in
you can just get the color on the tip
and use the tip to do it and I think
that's amazing so detail parts and
crease brush I feel like if you don't
own either you should just buy both I'm
saying that I haven't tried it but all
of their all of their black brushes so
far that I've tried are really good so
I'm just assuming it's gonna be really
really good I'll let you know alright I
did brought by another brush because it
reminded me of this tapered highlighting
brush that I have from Delhi am to let I
really like and I also involve like a
well it's not quite like this for one
they're just a lot of these kind of
highlighting shaped brushes in the world
right now and so elf came out with their
beautifully precise precision tapered
highlighting brush and I thought oh yeah
I want to try that this is great but you
do have to be careful like with any
brush like this if you're not wanting to
get it everywhere you really do need to
like focus it in the area you want and
really put it in that area but it's
really really soft it's just like the
other ones I own you know it's the same
kind of like anyway um love that I tried
another elf just so you know this elf
beautifully precise like powder brush is
amazing I use it every single day so
it's just one I already own that I love
so that is really really cool so this
next product is one I already know that
I don't like because I've been trying it
elf I told you I ordered this stuff like
a few weeks ago well while I was waiting
for that in that interim period elf sent
me a PR package that had their new
highlighting holographic duo so I don't
want to open this one because I'm gonna
pass it on to someone that actually
would like it it's just not my cup of
tea but let me show I'll still swatch
the ones I already own that way I don't
mess that one up so this one's in the
shade Blue Lagoon and they're these
duo's that are supposed to be kind of
holographic they kind of are I mean if
you're on a budget and you're just
wanting to play with this kind of thing
then this is perfect so I think this is
crazy high quality know now of course
elf is more budget however they do have
unbelievably amazing products so for me
in the weirdest way I kind of expect a
lot from them and so when they miss the
mark I'm like really elf like who
approves this um this one's in the shade
sirens call and it's kind of like an
orange e and white duo um they're just
okay do I think they're like the worst
thing ever no and then this one is
mermaid seal which is actually the one I
a myself had ordered and it's more of
like a light purple and a light kind of
pinkish shade this was the one I was
actually the most disappointed in I
think the creamiest one would have to be
the one in sirens call but these are not
necessarily colors I personally would
use so you know it is what it is I will
say the packaging the elf kind of has
that like you're a Desson holographic
whatever tint to it which i think it's
cool but then
I don't think it's like worth placing an
order just for that let me just say that
um so I also bought a couple of blush
items so I love their single blushes
their studio blushes are freaking
amazing so I bought one in mellow mauve
now here's the thing anytime I'm in a
store that sells elf
their blush is literally all like I'll
see five mellow moths and all of them
will look a different shade I know it's
the weirdest thing I'm like is it the
lighting in the store like what's going
on same goes for what and well I don't
know if it's because they're cheaper
blushes but mellow mauve has been one of
my favorite oh there was like even
creamier than they even used to be it's
just this perfect everyday color like
completely on my alley I have one right
now and oh I already had mellow mauve
well that would be why I was drawn to it
see they're almost the same shade but
not quite there is this shift to it yeah
I feel like the newer one is better like
literally it's watch better everything
um I feel like there it's just a little
bit creamier now it's a little bit
deeper again I've had this one for a
long time so I guess in the end it works
out because it was probably about time
to replace this one I love their blushes
if you haven't tried them they are
fantastic I mean absolutely as good as
if not better than high-end it doesn't
matter
they're so good alright but the other
blush product I got was their matte
blush duo in soft and subtle I heard
someone talking about this recently
might have been Emily Noel but it's
almost like a bronzer shade in a in like
a kind of highlight shape but I just
wanted to try it this one really is kind
of yellowy it probably won't work for me
on like any level they're they're weird
swatch place that I could probably get
away with the bronzer II blush but I
really just wanted to try the format it
seems kind of buttery I'll have to try
it out let you guys know so next thing I
got was this I don't even remember
ordering this why did I I don't know but
it's their color correcting liquid
primer incorrect
apricots and I don't know I was gonna
say why I'm interested I don't know it
says this color correcting liquid primer
helps enhance skin tone and blur
imperfections while prepping the skin
for makeup oh I think this would be I
think I remember why I bought it I
thought it would be similar to like the
Becca backlight primer no this almost
looks like a straight-up foundation oh
my gosh that's literally like foundation
no not to see it's a bad thing but I
mean this is like maybe two apricot I
don't know I mean my lights wash it out
a little bit but um I mean it really is
like color and it's not like wearing out
much so unless it's like a good match
for you like if your skin is too dark
that would look crazy I don't know what
I was expecting though I mean it did say
it was like a tinted so I knew it would
have a tint but I thought it'd be more
of a tint not a like full color you know
what I'm saying
so again I'll let you know oh I got the
silicon glitter applicator I was like I
want to see if that works
it's literally like a little silicone
paddle and I guess the idea is that you
freaking get glitter in it and press it
on but I thought well how is this gonna
hold on to the glitter the silicone it
so I don't know can't wait to try can't
wait to like you know I was just so
intrigued but again I love the elves
kind of being more inventive I think
that's really neat this I am pumped this
is their correct and set eye powder in
banana
it says deep tone oops well I wanted to
try it anyway I mean it looks like a
nice light yellow so it's just a little
like loose powder that obviously is
meant to help conceal your under eye I
love using powders like this over my
concealer just to brighten the area and
set the area so it's definitely yellow
tone but I mean it's light certainly
light enough for me
it looks nice again this is one of those
products it's hard to tell until you put
it on but I do like products like this
and if this is a cheap alternative to a
lot of the expensive ones that would be
amazing and it's tons of product if you
think about it like it's gonna take me
forever to run through that next product
I got was their pro eyeshadow primer and
clear and
these are products that like I didn't
even know they sold well this one says
new not all of them say new but this one
does um but I haven't seen it I loved
that how it was packaged doesn't that
look like a very kind of industrial in a
way but I kind of like that package very
different for elf well not really what
am I talking about anyway but it said it
was clear how is that clear you guys see
that
it's literally like an apricot shade now
I'm sure it will be transparent yeah it
definitely blends to be transparent but
it
I literally expected almost like a clear
gloss not a gloss but you know what I
mean it definitely has that kind of
velvet silicone is that the right word
feel to it which I do like I'm curious
to put that on my eyes but I am so weird
I don't know why I like this packaging
so much but I do all right I also tried
these little bestfriend
eyes shadow duo's this is in peach squad
because I thought you know I've really
gotten so into palettes and I know a lot
of us have then I forget how nice it is
to have a nice like duo or single that
you just love you know and so I thought
maybe I will just fall in love with one
of these they're so cute so I mean it's
really gold and peach ooh
decently pigmented actually more than I
would have thought I will say the gold
it's it's definitely a gold it's not
like super shimmery it does have a
little Sheen to it but it's not like
crazy shimmery so that was Pete the
peach one this one I got is in t42 and
it's much much lighter it's got kind of
a light bronze and then like an ivory
cream okay so the light won the bronze
actually is really pretty again same
thing it's got a sheen to it and then
the other one the ivory ish color that's
Matt it's hard to tell but these might
be nice just for like an everyday look
for me just kind of dusting that on
throwing down on the lid and calling it
a day I am actually really excited to
try those until you with eyeshadow I
also got their sculpting silk eyeshadow
palette it's called Rose a all day says
its sculpts brightens into
so the packaging is a little different
than other ones they've used for little
shadow things and there's actually a
nice sized pan in there so we've got
like a light kind of beige we've got
like a rosy light color and then like a
deep matte plummy Brown almost not bad I
think that matte light shade is not as
finished as the others but again that
might be perfect for right in the crease
which is the idea you know defining kind
of brightening with the shimmer and then
sculpting assuming that's how they meant
it so I that might be what I use for
work tomorrow it just be a really simple
but nice look um I was gonna say again
I'll tell you how it is eventually but I
think I've said that on/off I repurchase
the makeup remover pen I always have
like five on back up because I use these
every day to clean up my winged liner
you know whatever they're so simple I go
I replaced it every few months a lot of
people asked how I keep the tip of this
clean it's kind of like a marker but
it's got makeup remover in it so what I
do is like if I use it to get a little
bit of liner off I'll take like I
usually have like a washcloth in front
of me a dark one that I just like wash
all the time that's another little tip
go to like the Dollar Tree and buy a
bunch of cheap washcloths and like I'll
just use it like for a couple days I'll
use a different part of it cold and
different way you use that part and I
can wipe my brush just off really
quickly and then I just throw it in the
wash and get the next one out so it's
like really nice cuz I'm not wasting
like paper towels and wipes all the time
anyway so I'll just take this after I
get something on it and just wipe it on
there and it usually wipes right off as
long as you do it right away and that's
what makes it last a little bit longer
for me and you can also pull the tip out
and flip it around if you want it and
get a little bit more use that other end
is kind of weird but you can still use
it alright next thing I got was a brow
pencil I really got enough that I could
almost do a full face I'm thinking about
doing like a best and worst of elf
products maybe instead of a hall update
I would just do like because I have so
many other elf products and it's been a
while since I've done like a best and
worst of elf
especially with all these new things
maybe I'll do that instead you guys let
me know what you'd prefer I don't think
I need to do both I think that might be
like elf overkill but maybe that would
be more beneficial to see okay what then
are the best things and the worst thing
all of the elf products I own so I got
this ultra precise brow pencil in the
shade that's in it uh neutral Brown I
figure that's perfect
it's gonna be maybe more of an ashy
Brown it looks like it should be a good
it's kind of hard not a Sarah Lee in a
bad way because you can get really small
strokes with it but I love the tiny
spoolie that's totally my kind of a
spoolie so I actually am very excited I
haven't used a thin brow pencil like
this in a very long time but I used to
love them so seems like it might be
right up my alley and it would totally
if it's good be a dupe for the Anasazi
brows it's like the exact same looks
wise um so I got a waterproof gel
eyeliner pencil in black it really never
found a liner pencil from them that I
loved so when I saw that it was like a
waterproof gel like that is totally up
my alley
oh yeah crazy black crazy creamy so
excited to try that I'll let you know if
it actually like stays in place though
but that will be the key I also bought a
mascara I asked a lot of you guys for
what mascara do you recommend from ELF
because I really only tried a few and
what I've tried I didn't like at all so
this is their volume plumping mascara
I'm gonna go ahead and open it because I
know I'm gonna use it to try it it looks
like my kind of a brush which is why I
ended up buying it you guys a lot of you
guys recommended this and of course
there were a lot that were recommended
so I'm kind of I'm just gonna put a
little on yeah I don't know I'm just
putting on top of other mascara um it
seems like my cup of tea I'll let you
know it'd be awesome if this were great
oh okay another thing was this lip tint
I think is the only lip color yeah that
eye or lip product that I bought at all
but I liked the idea of it being just a
lip tint tint why missing 10th um that I
don't think is how here's my song yeah
so yeah it's just a squeezy - it really
is like a clear gel I'm gonna put some
on it's hard to tell if it has like a
true tint because I'm putting this on
like a lipstick that I kind of just Pat
it on my lips as well I'm wearing the
Marc Jacobs lipstick in
this by the way um so you know it's
let's see just on my hand yeah it's got
a little bit of a tint to it I kind of
like it it really is more of just a
clear gloss though but I'm really
getting into just more glossy comfy
looks so for me I'm like that looks like
my cup of tea now the outside is very
misleading because it's not that shade
like you just saw it it's just mostly a
clear gel it doesn't feel too sticky it
doesn't have a taste I don't think it
has a smell either which is nice
so those are all the new products I've
picked up a lot of those are new to the
offline some of them I they might have
sold for a while if they'd just been so
under my radar I guess so like I said
let me know below would you rather see a
haul update just for these products or
would you rather see kind of more of a
brand overview or I talked about all of
the best and worst from the brand like I
said I think doing both is too much just
about elf because there's so many other
brands out there I want to also talk
about and spend time trying and you know
doing videos about so let me know
definitely give this video a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it or if you love elf or
you just like these more affordable
videos I mean I'm gonna do them
regardless cuz I like I like trying this
kind of stuff it's it's my home chargers
my home base and always will be
anyway so I hope you'll subscribe if you
enjoy and I'll see you guys in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
