gigantic elf halt you guys know my
channel is deeply rooted in elf I have
so many elf products that I absolutely
love and I do reviews and demos with
most of my face today is done with these
elf products I'm about to show you I
realized I don't have I mean I've got
tons of elf but I actually don't have
enough to do a completely full face
which I thought was kind of interesting
so I used as much as I could I'm about
to show you guys like an insane amount
of products but I have been so blessed
elf sent me all of these just for
consideration for me to do with whatever
I please I mean I could show them I
could not show them I can you know it's
not like they're paying me to show this
or anything so just know as always I'm
always unbiased and I'm gonna tell you
straight whether I like them or not and
there are tons of elf products that I
don't like so if you'd like I can link
my elf videos of dumb where I've done
like best and worst of elf products cuz
there are some that I would say avoid
avoid avoid but then there are some time
like how are these only three dollars or
one dollar so definitely check it out
below and let's go ahead and get into it
let's start with some of their lip
products they sent they sent me three of
their elf matte lip colors and I'm
wearing one today today I'm wearing wine
and what I actually really like the
packaging of these they remind me of
like the NARS ones that come like this
and they are really matte but they're
comfortable and they it's a really small
bullet style so you can almost line your
lips with it and then color it in and
that's why I love it and for me since I
travel a lot
and I've got my honeymoon to France
coming up
I am definitely thinking about packing
one of these because I for a vampy lip I
really like this and I think it's
amazing in the fall or any time I mean I
wear this year-round I don't care but I
love these so so much and I want to get
like the whole line because these are
absolutely incredible but I really
really liked wine they also sent fuchsia
which is like this bright pink color and
then they also sent cranberry which is
like a little bit more muted if you'd
like me to do swatch videos and review
use of any of these things you see today
let me know there's so many that there's
no I can't swatch them all and I know
some of you guys like no man but it
would be insane so just let me know
which ones you're the most interested in
so very excited about those they also
sent me a couple of they're moisturizing
lipsticks now I've tried a few of these
this one is pink mink and it's just like
a really light pink and I've already
opened it they also sent wink pink which
looks a little bit more bright so I'm
excited some of these clearly I've
opened and played with in some I have it
very excited about those I have always
heard good things about those and the
ones I've tried really are moisturizing
and yet they last for quite a while so
I've always been impressed with those
they also sent me in this since I have I
think the whole line I am gonna do a
swatch and review video on all of these
soon these are their mineral lipsticks
and they come in little white packages
but they're actual the actual container
is black like most elf products they
have cute elf thing on top so I got a
ton of these and I will insert a picture
right now so you can see all the
different ones I will definitely do a
video on these like I said because I
have so many but the sheets they sent
let me read them are nicely nude
beautiful berry party pink rosy tan
royal red runway pink and rich raspberry
so a ton of those I'm really excited to
mess with those I haven't even tried
those on yet so fairy setting I'm going
to say very excited a lot I'll try not
to okay so now everything else is gonna
be kind of in random order because I've
been using it and I'll tell you what I'm
wearing too so they sent a few of their
brushes they sent their contour and
kabuki brush now I've done a video and
demo with their ultimate kabuki brush
which is like more flat but they sent
their contouring kabuki brush which is
kind of similar where it's like kind of
flat ish but it really is thick like the
kabuki it's crazy soft so I'm excited to
give that a try I think this would be
instead of for contouring I think it'd
be better just for bronzing up the face
kind of like the other one is really and
then they also said I didn't know they
sold this the retractable kabuki brush
so it's one of those classic like I feel
like I remember using these when I was a
kid I don't really see the benefit of
this because I mean I get that the
bristles are
tected and it's nice so I guess in a
purse but when I travel I bring like my
regular brushes in a cup so for me
travel wise I probably wouldn't use it
but I think this actually now that I'm
saying it I think it would be good in a
purse because you know it's not gonna
get all messed up so that is pretty nice
okay they also sent their zip eraser now
I've used let me pull it out because I
use it all the time I've been using
their acne like little gel with the
rollerball for years because it's got
salicylic acid and like right now I've
got a breakout there I always have
breakouts on my chin
anyway but I was excited to use this cuz
this seems to be a little bit stronger
like when I put it on this it got rid of
it pretty quick
I like to say it killed it because it
did like it's not growing it's like on
the downward spiral girls that sounded
really gross anyway but this stuff I
swear is stronger than the other stuff
so I think I do like this better this
one has like a brush tip that you just
brush the acne fighting gel on so really
excited about this this is definitely
something I travel with okay they also
sent their i refresh like roller thing
that's really cool to the touch and it's
just kind of like a treatment just feels
good I've been using this in the morning
when I first wake up the past few
morning's just like I've got allergies
right now so I'm my eyes are just a
little bit puffy when I wake up and
they're you know still itchy and this
has been feeling amazing just I've been
doing around the whole eye and just like
kind of fanning it and just feel so cool
and refreshing so for that purpose alone
I've been using it and I love it they
also sent actually a couple of the lip
exfoliator
now when I first did an elf like best
amorous video a long time ago I said
that I hated this and I did because the
moisturizing part of this exfoliating
stick would wear off and it would just
be the exfoliator but a lot of you guys
said you know they kind of reformulated
it and so I'm excited to try it again
plus there were a lot of tips you guys
gave on you know maybe putting on
something moisturizing before you even
do it and then it kind of I don't know
so I'm excited to try this one more time
and maybe I will fall in love with it so
you guys will like these these are their
elf
prism eyeshadow like palettes they gave
me sunset and smoke now as part of
sunset I'm wearing today on my lid
so this is like crazy pigmented
eyeshadow and sunset is quite an
appropriate name for these but let me
just show you I'm wearing this one this
third one in on my eyes today and it is
insane and there's not really as much
fall out as I would have guessed from
these I would have guessed that it would
be a mess but there's it's really not so
that's pretty incredible let me swatch
so this next one is smoke again a polly
titled because it's got all these deeper
colors I actually haven't even watched
this palÃ¼ these are more like those two
old tones that you see it reminds me of
a Sonia Kashuk palette that they sell
but I mean absolutely beautiful honestly
you could get these two palettes and
kind of be set for a while you know what
I mean like these have all the cool
tones and all the warm tones you could
need for like crazy pops of color I for
me I can't create an entire look with
these I mean I could but it wouldn't be
one that I would like I need like a
mixture of some matte but I think these
are really cool additions to my
collection I was actually really excited
to get these and they are absolutely
gorgeous so that is a win and I think
for me I'd rather have smaller palettes
like this to fill in the gaps then like
a giant palette that has everything
because I know myself and I know I'm not
gonna pull out that big palette but
these I'm more likely to pull out you
know what I'm saying so you have a
collection besides that a lot of us have
okay they also sent oh and I have some
of these I haven't open they're long
lasting lustrous eyeshadow and I could
not figure out I've done a video on the
elf smudge pots which are like their
cream shadow and I was like are these
cream shadows or are they like the like
what am I thinking up that L'Oreal
infallible chalice looks like a loose
powder but it's kind of pressed this is
it's it's a cream it's like whipped
almost and this what's this shade where
does it say the shade oh soiree
this is like a rosy tone and these are
like crazy pigmented but they're here
okay I know I'm sorry I'm like bumbling
right now what I love about these is
they're as pigmented as those shadows I
just showed you but there's no chance
for fallout at all so I really liked
they also sent this gold one in toast
and I've used this a lot this week just
over my lid before putting on other
shadows because it's the most shimmery
base ever but it doesn't move and
there's no fallout so it's I'm like this
might be the best edition I've had
because when I want a really really
beautifully sparkly look you don't want
to put Sparkle because it ends up
everywhere no matter what you do no
matter what base you've got it just ends
up all over the place at the end of the
day but these don't go anywhere because
they are a cream base so I have fallen
in love this shade I just showed you is
in well it must have peeled off darn it
but it's more of a silvery they also
sent some deeper colors so like this one
is in festivity and it's like a deep
purple okay so the next thing they sent
was their elf palette Perfector and I've
seen a lot of people talk about this in
the shade glow and I will swatch this
for you it's got a brush tip and it's
just like this insanely sparkly lick lip
gloss I mean it's not like a lacquer I
wouldn't say but in in my head this
would be amazing kind of like that one
Revlon one I recently showed just in the
center of your bottom lip just to
perfect your pout to make it look a
little more 3-dimensional you can wear
it alone but I think for my taste you
know I'm 26 years old I don't
necessarily want that glossy but look
all the time I mean I'm from time to
time but I think this is a really cool
almost tool for that purpose so I really
like that today I'm wearing their elf HD
lifting concealer
they sent me fair which is perfect I
know I look a little bit tanner today
but that's just cuz I did that marathon
and I was in the Sun doesn't matter
anyway so this really is nice I I'm
wearing it today and I think it does a
really good job of concealing it's just
got a doe foot applicator you know it's
nothing really to write home about but I
do like it and it doesn't really budge
anywhere and I mean it's good it's not
I've tried cheaper ones and even more
expensive ones from the drugstore that
I've hated and this one does a really
good job so is it my favourite can see
on the world no but it's a really good
option yes so here you go they also said
I think this is new their elf
exact lash mascara now you guys know
I've been obsessed with the really thin
wands like forgetting my lower lashes or
just for like almost tightlining
and there's a cosmetic one I love
there's a Maybelline one I love so I
thought this would be good for that
purpose it's a teeny tiny brush but
here's the thing you guys it's too tiny
like and there's like three ridges on it
so I can't really it's just not really
serving any purpose for me I'm gonna
mess with it a little bit I'm wondering
if as it dries out if it'll be a little
bit better but it's it's kind of wet and
it's really hard to work with so in the
end I ended up with it all over my skin
I was like this isn't worth it so I'm
gonna try it out a few more times but it
hasn't been a favorite for me they also
sent their mascara primer now this is
one of those white primers I used it
once and honestly it kind of weighed my
lashes down so they didn't hold a curl
like they usually do so that was kind of
a turn-off but again I've only used it
once so I want to try it quite a few
more times to decide
I haven't been big on mascara primers as
it is so if you have any primers that
you know that are amazing that hold a
curl as well let me know down below cuz
I am curious to try some like actually
great ones this is oh okay this is an
exciting product for me this is their
ELF hydrating under eye primer and it's
a little pump and it's like a grub not
green what a pink little solution or
lotion and it's supposed to be a
moisturizing primer and it feels amazing
on my under eye you do have to let it
dry I used it today before my concealer
so I moisturize my face and then I
actually had put my foundation on then I
put this under eye primer all over and
it just moisturizes the area so nicely I
mean and yet I think it holds on to the
concealer I haven't worn it enough times
to see if it actually helps prevent
concealer from going into your fine
lines but honestly I like it for the
moisturizing capability alone and what I
like is that it doesn't make my under
eye look greasy once I put concealer on
top of it it just it really is a nice
prime and I love it it's a tiny pump I
think this is something I'm gonna end up
using every single day because I just
like it and I've always thought that
like why would you prime your under-eye
it's just gonna make it look creepier or
it's gonna you know look greasy err but
this is kind of bridge the gap perfectly
so I love it okay moving forward they
also sent two of their baked blushes
these are more like highlights
to me they sent this peachy cheekiest
what this one's called it's kind of a
peach color this if you were really fair
you could wear as a blush but it really
is more of like a highlighting color you
know you could I mean I probably could
get away with wearing it but I would
rather top a blush with this kind of as
like a perfect topping there and then
this one I'm actually wearing today and
this is called pink tastic and I've
heard a lot of people like this one it
reminds me of my hard candy
one I mean look at that you could wear
that as an eyeshadow straight up it's an
absolutely beautiful kind of golden
champagne color I like it a lot now you
do have to use a light hand I actually
use too heavy of a hand today and I had
to kind of take my foundation brush back
over it kind of blend it because it can
get it could look crazy real quick but
it's absolutely beautiful this doesn't
move all day that's the thing I noticed
about a lot of elf products if they're
good they're fantastic and they don't
move so these are absolutely beautiful
beautiful highlights they also set I was
very excited about this because I
haven't heard of these the elf pressed
mineral bronzers they sent two shades
tan toffee and beech bronze now beech
bronze is more of a they're both warm
tones but beech bronze is more of a gray
tone so it looks a little bit better on
me when I'm trying to contour with it
whereas this one is more of like an
orange tone a little bit warmer but I
actually am wearing this warm one all
over my face that kind of bronze to
match my skin I really like it this
stuff is really pigmented I'll swatch
both
it is crazy pigmented so when you use it
there they are there
this one let me tell you this one is
beat the beach beach bronze and then
this one is tanta fee they're really
really pigmented that was one swipe so
you do it again have to use a light
again and I again I was kind of doing it
early morning light so it's it's too
much I can see that now so you really
have to use light hand but again these
don't budge throughout the day they're
amazing okay so the blush I'm wearing
today
is this elf mineral blush and it's in
the shade joy there okay I first of all
I'm just falling in love with mineral
Rush's from a few different companies
but this one is absolutely a beautiful
pink color I'm wearing it like I said on
my cheeks today it's just so like light
and yet pigmented but not too pigmented
see I can't even get a right a proper
swatch of a mineral blush it's kind of
hard too but it's just this beautiful
glow of pink color do you see that and I
just noticed that it always makes my
skin look flawless you can never really
it never really looks patchy when I use
mineral blushes from any brand really
but this one is so inexpensive compared
to the one that I love from everyday
minerals that it's such a nice option
they have a few shades I'm pretty sure
but this is the one they sent I might
get more because I love it okay moving
forward they also sent some of their
cream eyeliners they didn't send me a
black one which I was kind of sad about
because I would love I tried their black
cream liner a long time ago and I think
they've read down the formula I don't
know for sure and I would love to get it
and try it this is in gunmetal and it's
kind of more of like a grayish pewter
color and then this one's metallic olive
and it's like a green I don't really
wear colored liner so I might pass these
on to a sister or a friend that would
just because I know that I'm I just
don't wear color line I just don't I
mean it's not my taste so why force it
they also set the makeup mist and set
now I've had this before I use the whole
thing up it is such a you can use it
like before you put on makeup or if you
just don't wear makeup and you just want
a refreshing mist
it's lovely on days like that you can
wear it you can put it on afterwards and
for me what it does I don't think it
necessarily makes my makeup stay on
longer but what it does for me is if I
look really kind of powdery or cakey or
crepey I'll spray this on a light mist
all over my face and it just kind of
reactivates everything and it makes
everything meld together a little bit
better and it's a really inexpensive
spray to do that and I really I love it
it's so it really is a lovely product
they also sent their daily moisture
stick and the one that I have right now
I think I'm almost out of the way I use
this is I will let me grab it so I can
show you
so what I'll do with it this is the one
I already have is I'll take this stick
it's kind of like a ball me stick and
I'll just dip my finger in it and then
just press it into this area so if I'm
looking really dry or things have
settled into fine lines I'm just
actually doing it now I'll just press it
in and it again it's almost like it
reactivates that area and it feels good
and it doesn't end up messing up your
makeup at all in fact it just makes it
look better so I love this for that
purpose so I'm excited to have a backup
because this one is almost gone it's a
great product they also sent there this
is cool
so I have their primer again all sorts -
I have their mineral face primer that I
really really like but I don't use
primer every day and that's just the
honest truth I really don't I've noticed
that the foundations that I love look
amazing just as they are and primers
tend to mess with my skin so much in
either direction that I end up just
liking my skin better with just a
moisturizer and then foundation so
that's just the way my skin is though
but this is their sunscreen face primer
and I love that because like the
foundation I'm wearing today is a Revlon
the Colorstay whipped and it doesn't
have SPF in it so if I'm going out and I
want to wear that this is awesome to be
able to put underneath it and I again I
love this packaging I think it's really
classy and then the pump is really
really a good pump and it's this is like
a thick plastic so it's just awesome so
I'm excited about that
they also sent their elf eyebrow kit in
medium now I haven't been using powder
on my brows in a long time I fell in
love with the anastacio powder but I
realized that you finding a good pencil
it's way easier to fill in my brows that
way then it is with powder powder just
takes me forever and I don't really use
the wax that comes in these so I'm
excited to have it and to try it but for
everyday use I just know myself I won't
I just won't
and I think that the powder could work
it's more like a taupe powder and I'm
hoping it's not gonna pool like red
because I'm just weird about that with I
don't like what it pulls red so I will
give it a try but I know that if I don't
like it my mom will love it
so if I don't ever try it I'll pass
as my mom does like powder for her brows
so and we have about the same hair color
all right so they also send their
shimmering facial whip in spotlight and
I've had this in so it's like a white
type of liquid highlight I don't use
liquid highlight often I noticed that it
just even when I do it with a stippling
brush with my finger with a Beauty
Blender it never quite looks right on my
skin no matter what I've used benefit
high beam and so I think I'm gonna
before I even open this I think I'm
going to pass this on one of my sisters
would look absolutely beautiful with
this on her skin so I'm gonna pass this
on before I even open it to her it is
enough if you here's what I'll say
because I have tried their facial whips
if you like liquid highlights you'll
love these because they again they stay
on all day they're absolutely
beautifully glowy you can mix these with
your foundation to make it look glowy or
so if you're looking for one and you
don't want to buy like let me pull out
like I've got the benefit high beam and
if I was gonna use one this would be the
one that I like you know they sell more
golden e ones from Sela but elf sells
all the different shades like that
and I would say if you know you're not
gonna use it often enough go with one of
these because they really are nice I
just don't like that type of highlight
so they also sent their SPF 45 sunscreen
but it's like a finely milled powder and
I have quite a few of these elf products
in this packaging I kind of hate this
packaging it's just so big and bulky I
would much prefer to have it in like a
you know the everyday minerals they're a
lot thinner and it's probably the same
amount of product but I mean I love the
elf black sleek packaging it's just so
big but they always come with their big
puff and then you take the grade off and
yeah so I will try it out because I like
the idea of you know like if you were to
put maybe some sort of BB cream on and
then if you're about to go out for the
day like maybe garage saleing which I'm
looking forward to doing soon here
because it's spring you could just dust
this SPF 4500 all over your face to kind
of mattify it in a way but still provide
that SPF coverage on top of maybe the
SPF you already have on because my
problem with SPF is that always makes
look so greasy so this might be nice to
add another layer of SPF but help to
mattify it as well so I thought that was
actually really cool they also sent one
of their duos now I think I have all
their duos and I just decluttered some
of them this is their blush and bronzing
powder the matte version and I actually
already have this so I'm gonna say this
for a giveaway because I know and that
one of you guys would absolutely love
this and this is sold out a lot on their
site so I'm gonna save this and put it
away in my little giveaway stash shop
and then this will be another thing out
into that because I already have it it's
the kabuki face brush and it is amazing
these are crazy soft and they're just
really good for what they are so I'm
gonna add this to the giveaway pile as
well let me know what you like me to
review maybe do more in depth especially
once I've tried a lot more of these I
think that will be way more helpful so
and in fact now what I'm thinking about
some of the products that I mentioned
that maybe I'll give two sisters I give
my sisters a lot of makeup maybe all
throw those into a giveaway and you know
what why don't I just do a giveaway
right now you see know you're seeing the
wheels turn so I think if I were to do a
giveaway with these things and I'm just
gonna I'm deciding right now I'm going
to it's gonna be this mad duo this
kabuki face brush oh the shimmery facial
whip because like I said it is a really
good product I just don't like that kind
I'll put in the day the moisture stick
because I still have a little bit left
of mine and I know you guys will love
this so I'm gonna put that in um let's
see over when these cream liners because
again even though I don't like the
colored liner some of you guys will so I
will throw that in with it as well um
all from when this moisturizing lipstick
and wink pink because I've got the other
one that I already opened and swatch but
this one I haven't and first of all I
have enough lipsticks but they look
pretty similar in color and this looks
absolutely beautiful so I know you guys
would love that
I'll throw in these the other eyeshadows
I haven't opened yet I've already opened
and swatched these three so I wouldn't
want to send those on but I haven't
opened these yet and I will I really
love these but I know you guys will too
and I've got plenty so I'm gonna throw
those in what else have I not like
opening swatch
I think all of those I have oh yeah well
I'll prove this into because I have tons
like this and I can buy another one
the elf makeup mist insect because it is
absolutely amazing everything else I've
got open and swatch so I don't want to
necessarily pass that on the way it is
