have a haul for you kind of I did order
a few things off of eyes lips face
because there was something I ran out of
that I needed and then I also have my
Ipsy bag from this month which is
September right I keep thinking it's
October probably just because I wish it
was October because October is the best
folia smun Thor but anyway ok September
and it's this September it's you back so
we'll start with that it always comes in
this cute little pink packaging I will
link below how to join its it's just so
awesome because it's $10 a month and you
can cancel anytime it's not like you're
locked in and then they're gonna make it
really hard it's really easy to cancel
I've cancelled a few times just because
I'm like I shouldn't spend the money
this month or whatever so it's really
easy to cancel but it's ten hours a
month and you always get a makeup bag
and this is the makeup bag that came
with it this time and you always get
five products usually most of them are
like full size there's very and you'll
see what I mean it's really is awesome
and they always give you a bunch of like
promo code type things for like 20 to
30% off for a lot of different brands
that are featured that month and this
month's theme is classic beauty and it
also came with this you know the
Michelle Phan like life palette that
she's come out with it comes with like
examples and then like a little like
trial thing so that came with that
and then the makeup bag this cream
doesn't feel as nice as it was last
month
but it's still really cute but it's not
you'll see what I mean if you have this
but but it's okay and I will definitely
use this I like to use these just in my
purse to hold makeup okay so it came
with this tinted lip balm and kalynn
know I'm sorry
the brand is Kailen it's in the shade
big apple it's this kind of like red
looks pretty but for a tinted lip balm
the only thing that I'm like is it's one
of those containers where it comes with
like the little brush and then you can
do this and then
you can dip it in there and do that but
if it's just a lip balm I'm not going
through that much trouble for a lip balm
you know what I'm saying like I don't
know it just seems like a lot of work
and it's actually really kind of big and
bulky for a lip balm so I don't know how
much use I might give this to one of my
sisters cuz I don't know okay so the
rest of these though I was like
thoroughly impressed with so I got a nyx
single eye shadow it's full-size in the
shade kryptonite and it's like this deep
smoky gray it does have some glitter on
it in it I mean it's okay but it like
that's it kind of washed out it's kind
of pretty I think that'd be a really
nice
outer corner color I'm not big on super
dark eyeshadows as you probably well no
but I do everyone smile smoke out like
that outer corner so this might be
really a nice option and the next
eyeshadows always are always really nice
okay
it also came with this full-size
certainly full size look up big business
eye liner it's from the brand star looks
it's in the shade obsidian and I'm gonna
open it because it is not open yet let
me see if I can get it it looks like
it's certainly I hope it's just black
that's what it kind of looks like it's
just a straight black it's the kind yet
to show oh wow look at that it's just
like a regular pencil one it's certainly
like black as black this is gonna be
awesome and if the product actually goes
to the end that'd be great because this
is a very long pencil so this might last
quite a while so that's a freaking sweet
deal man okay two more things in this
bag it came with a this is a trial size
a trial size mascara it's by Elizabeth
Mott it's the it's so big volumizing
mascara I'm not gonna open this because
I've got a lot of mascaras I want to
open first so I don't want to get this
all dried out before I even get to use
it and then it also came with this
butter LONDON nail polish now this is a
little bit smaller than the typical
butter LONDON nail polishes but nail
polish I've never run out of one usually
would go bad before I'd run out of it so
I'm not too concerned about it
full-sized it's in the shade love moss
and it's like one of those deep I think
they were calling it like ox blood you
know I love it though it's so perfect
for fall and winter so I'm really
excited to wear this and I have not
tried butter LONDON I don't think so I'm
excited to give it a try okay
so now on to droppin things everywhere
my L Paul it wasn't as big as I have
done in the past when it comes to elf
because I was like I really don't need
much but there was one reason that I
placed the order in the first place I
wanted to get a lighter shade in the
their mineral foundations so it looks
like this I had it in like the shade
light and I wanted it in porcelain
because well I'm paler than I was when I
got it so I got it in the shade
porcelain and it's just you know it's
closed right now but it's just like the
bare minerals stuff you put it with the
put it on with the powder brush I just
love it it's such a nice glow almost on
your face without looking shimmery
anything and for a powder based item it
really looks nice on your face it
doesn't look powdery or cakey and for
those days that either you're just
wearing a BB cream or maybe you're just
not wearing anything but lotion on your
face this is perfect because it really
covers a surprising amount like I was
absolutely surprised it covers a lot and
these are only five dollars and they
always have sales going on I think I
ended up getting this half off there was
some deal going on I don't know so
that's where I placed this order and
then I was like well if I'm gonna pay
for shipping I might as well get a few
more things to make it more worth it
so I ordered this eyebrow treat and tame
and actually I used it today guys I'm
loving this now the only thing is you
can't use it at least I can't use it
alone I had to kind of like outline with
my brow powder and a brush like outline
my brow if that makes sense and then I
used the this colored part to fill in
the rest and then I brush through it
with like a spoolie and I loved it and
it doesn't look like it's going anywhere
I mean and it matches perfectly I got it
in the shade ash no I did not just curse
ash and I'm not this is for treating it
says and it's like to help grow your
brow I'm not too concerned about that
but this has
like a spoolie to apply it and it's just
this shade for me is perfect it doesn't
pool red if you're one of those girls
that you are kind of like me where you
want something that's more like gray
tones not like brownish red tone then
this is perfect but like I said I tried
to use it alone and it was looking so
weird because I couldn't get a straight
line with this so but for filling in I
mean oh my gosh I love it so much so who
knew okay so I also got one of these
you're probably gonna laugh at me this
mascara and shadow shield now I've
always looked at these and thought okay
that's the dumbest thing I would never
actually use that except for lately I've
been using my L'Oreal infallible shadows
and there's not too much fall out but
there's usually a little bit and it's
really shimmery and so if it falls down
and it's here then I've got a disco ball
effect going you know I feel about that
so I've been doing this while I apply it
like literally so it just falls in my
hand I'm like okay Jessica you actually
would use this so this was three dollars
I got it half off for like a dollar
fifty and you can just put it under so
it catches it yes it looks silly but
it's practical for me because I do love
those infallible shades and I want to be
able to use them more often without
having to get my hand all up in there so
I'm really excited about this even
though it looks kind of silly okay I
also got two new brushes again they were
50% off I got these small smudger brush
and I also got the flat eyeliner brush
and the reason that I got these is
because I wanted some more options for a
cream eyeliner just because the one I'm
using is their small angled brush and I
like it but I don't know I'm wanting to
try different shapes so these are
definitely different shapes certainly
usable for that so I'm excited to give
it a try and plus if I don't like it for
that I could use these for like lower
lash line if I want to put like some
shimmery shadow which I do all the time
down there these are great stuff too
okay I also got another single eye
shadow these are only a dollar and I got
it in the shade sage it's just it's like
nice olive green which when it comes to
colored shadow I usually opt for greens
I don't know why I usually just like the
way they look
otherwise it's pretty much neutral
colors all the way and of course the
greens I'm choosing are pretty neutrally
but I really like this shadow and I've
been wanting it so I finally got it and
I'm gonna throw it into my Mac palette
where I keep most of my elf shadows cuz
I just know that I'm gonna love this as
a crease color I just know it and
they're only a dollar I just love them
they're so fantastic and they stay on
all day if you prime them okay and then
I also got this elf tone correcting
powder and I got it because I saw
someone I don't member who it was just
talking about it and it just looked
really I don't know interesting because
I've never used a colored powder and I
thought this might be nice to use over a
BB cream just to kind of even out my
tone even more so I was excited sorry i
hautelook just like announced something
mm-hmm anyway um I'm really excited
about this I don't really know how it's
gonna work I figure it can be used as an
all-over powder I got it in the shade
cool I think they have warm and then
they might have been one other one
however just looking at on my hand it
looks like I might be powdery so we'll
see I don't know we'll see but I'm
excited to even try and yeah so those
are all the things I got aside from like
I've been getting well I've been getting
these things for this project I have to
do and it's like autumn themed which is
what I chose it's just I know of course
I chose autumn as my theme but I've also
been getting like some autumn things for
that but they're also gonna serve as
decorations once that project is over so
I've been just on the hunt for other
things I just love this time of the year
don't you guys and I know I'm blessed
because I live in the Midwest so I
actually do get seasons and I have
friends that I talked to and they're
like oh it's so hot where I am and I
just feel so bad for you cuz I'm like oh
it's starting to get cool here and it's
so lovely of course I'm saying that
today the high is like 80 so it's still
warm but anyway I hope this is enjoyable
and if you enjoyed it please subscribe
and I'll see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
