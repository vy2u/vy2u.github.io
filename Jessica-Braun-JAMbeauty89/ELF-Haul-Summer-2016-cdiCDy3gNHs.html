an elf haul for you guys they actually
recently sent me nine new goodies that
they have available on their website and
I am so excited no this video is not
sponsored they send me like many other
companies products for me to do whatever
I want with and with elf I love elf and
I like showing them to you from time to
time and I know a lot of you guys ask
about it like what new products they
have what products would you recommend
etc so I'm excited to show you these
let's go ahead an get into it I just
said all that really fast like very fast
slow down just not a race ok let's start
with some new lip products they have so
this is the elf studio lip balm and it's
in the shade nude and it looks like it's
kind of a thinner I don't know that I've
ever tried these just there straight up
lip balms it's got like this really thin
too which i think is kind of cute and
it's got SPF 15 sunscreen so it comes in
this little thin tube and it happens to
the shade nude it looks kind of more
like a brown nude and it's just kind of
it really has a nice peach shift to it
and it's got a little bit of like
glimmer to it but not like glitter and
or anything and it just looks really
comfortable it has a nice minty smell I
just kind of drew on my nose with it
which I like so I want to try some other
shades i'll have to look on their site
and see like what else they have but
this is so cool because if you wore this
like when you're just out and about
you've got some SPF protection but it's
also just comfortable that's awesome the
next thing is a new shade of their matte
lip color is this a new shade its rich
red I feel like I've had rich red I
don't know but um who it looks like a
really red red oh it's actually kind of
different than I would have anticipated
I would have pictured a rich red to be
like deep but it's kind of more bright
and poppy so it's still a really pretty
color but it's just an interesting name
choice for it you guys think but these
are really nice I've done a whole swatch
video on tons of these if you're wanting
to maybe buy a couple and you're not
sure what shades to get i'll link that
video below because i did a lot of them
so you can see them how they look and
how they wear but on the bottom of this
is like a little shaper so if you
want it to be back at that point you can
just kind of twist it in there and it
will shape it for you which i think is a
genius piece of this product next thing
is this elf hyper shine lipgloss and I
just started smiling because this was
one of my first elf products I ever
bought it was a hyper shine gloss I
don't even I have no idea what the shade
was and I loved it because to me like I
couldn't afford sila at the time and
they had these very similar packaged lip
glosses and I want to win so bad so i
bought the elf one and i would just like
pretend it was cielo oh my gosh it's my
truth anyway but this is in the shade
vixen so let's try it out I actually
like these and from a practicality
standpoint it's really not that
practical because it just gets kind of
messy but I love I just love it and
maybe it goes back to those days so
again it looks like a really fun kind of
bright colored gloss there it is and
it's right next to rich red there so
it's the obviously the gloss it's kind
of pretty let's see who it has a nice
kind of fruity scent yeah I would say
it's fruity a really nice fruity scent
so that is awesome I'm kind of excited
to have that just makes me smile so the
next thing is a shimmering facial whip
but it's in the shade pink lemonade
usually think of Beyonce it looks like a
really pretty kind of orchid light color
I'm excited to swatch this you I mean
the idea is that it's like a liquid
highlight but with one like this you
really could wear it as like a
straight-up blush or a blush topper you
know so the way I would apply it is i
would just squeeze it onto my hand oh my
gosh this is such a pretty color and
then just kind of rub it in oh my gosh
gosh you could almost put this on your
lips and then I would just take a
stippling brush elf actually sells a
really good one stipple it into it and
then just stipple it onto my cheeks as a
blush this is absolutely freaking
gorgeous are you serious are you serious
this might be the prettiest elf product
they ever come out with I cannot wait to
apply this it's got this gorgeous ship
it is the prettiest that's my favorite
shade of pink maybe that's why I'm
freaking out so much but oh my gosh and
I bet this it's just catching the light
so beautifully but I've used their
shimmering fascia lips before that are
like much lighter that i would put just
in my highlight zones on my face and
they are so beautiful so I know that
this is these don't really budge like at
all I wonder if they're if they're
waterproof I feel like it doesn't say
that it is but I swear these don't budge
I remember I have one on my hand we'll
see and it didn't move for a long time
when I was first playing these awesome
oh my gosh awesome and off links for all
this stuff below if you're curious about
any of them this next new product is a
new bronzers elf baked bronzer in Los
Cabos now I've tried some of their baked
products and they are incredible and I
when I saw them in stores I would look
at them and they just kind of looked dry
like I don't know and I'm kind of weird
about baked products because they always
look dry to me and I'm like I don't want
to put that on my face but I've kind of
changed my tune because they're elf
baked like highlighters and blushes are
so buttery this one is really dry I
spoke too soon because this one feels
kind of dry it's a really pretty color
and again the reality is if it's still
swatching nicely which it actually
really is and that's a really nice
bronzer color for my skin tone then it
doesn't matter if it feels dry because
you're if it's putting if you're putting
it on and it looks good it doesn't
really matter but it's like for me it's
like nails on a chalkboard sorry to say
that to any of you guys that it bothers
like it does me but anyway it's a really
really pretty colors I'm definitely
going to try this out as we're in summer
right now because it's just the perfect
shade and I like that it has a little
bit of a shimmer to it so it just makes
your skin look kind of healthy with it
so and for a couple bucks you cannot
meet it these next two products are too
long lasting lustrous eyes shadows well
and let's actually let's start with the
gold one this one is called toast know
if it's like toast like the bread toast
or it's like a champagne toast I would
think champagne toast so it just comes
in a little pot and how did it describe
it it's a shimmery whipped gel and it
easily blends for lasting comfort so
it's definitely like a whipped kind of
in a way it kind of reminds me of the
colour-pop ones whoo this is a really
pretty color kind of golden the only
thing is and I'll try and see it seemed
it like it's moving around in the pot a
lot like it's like dislodged but it's so
gorgeous let me try this over and see if
it's got the same issue kind of like
it's separated from the edges it could
either sometimes that indicates that
it's getting older but other times it
just indicates it's kind of the way the
product is formulated just that it's
naturally doesn't necessarily stick to
it yeah this one is fine this one's
totally fine Wow so what color is this
this is celebration oh my goodness these
are so neat they have a little bit of
Fallout which is kind of interesting
because they are like a gel but look at
that so that celebration and that is
toast these would be like beautiful on
New Year's Eve when they oh my gosh so
that is gorgeous these would be great
just as an inner rim like kind of pop
especially the silver one or the gold
depending on the look you're going for
so the last two items are cream eyeliner
so they sent me one in black and I think
I've tried their cream eyeliner before I
don't remember if I liked it or not or
maybe i'm thinking of wet and wild I
don't remember but it comes with this
tiny brush it's a little angled one
which is nice to have an app engine then
it just comes in a square pots I'm just
going to kind of I mean it's very black
yeah I mean it's super-dee-duper blacks
so that is good and I use cream eyeliner
almost every single day of my life so I
will definitely try this out and see how
well it goes it says these are long
wearing and smudge proof by the way this
is cream one in teal tease so again this
could be kind of fun in the summer well
it looks so pretty oh my gosh it's got a
little bit of glare in it it looks like
oh it is so pretty this is something
honestly you could totally put might be
hard to get off but you could totally
put this on your lid like if you wanted
to just straight-up where this fun pop
of color just all over now again it
might be hard to get off you might be
like waterproof remover but and I know
sometimes
colors like this at least not with elf
necessarily but like the pure minerals
wanna or there's a stila liner I've used
that was a color like this and it's
straight up stains so you have to be
aware i don't know if this one would
stain but it is such a pretty color so
those were all of the products they just
recently sent me again i'm not sure if
all of these are brand new shades or not
they might just be kind of summer type
things but either way i'll have them all
link below this is awesome i'm just
still not over this can we have a minute
can we have a moment of silence for this
i'm just still not over this i can't
wait to try it looks so pretty want to
paint my walls this color so other than
my brand new favorite elf product of all
time everything else seems so awesome so
i can't wait to try them out i will link
