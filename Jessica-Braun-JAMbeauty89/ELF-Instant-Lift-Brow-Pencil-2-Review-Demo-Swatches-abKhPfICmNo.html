bringing you a review of the elf instant
lift brow pencil they recently sent this
to me and I was very curious to try
these out because they only have three
shades and I was curious if any of them
would actually work for me because I'm
really picky and I don't like eyebrow
pencils that pull red I like it to be
more great toned or cool toned so they
only have three shades in the range and
you'll see in the swatches here the
darkest one is called deep brown the
middle one is called natural brown and
the lightest one is called taupe these
are two dollars on their side of course
I can link these below if you're curious
about them but I chose natural Brown for
mine because it was the closest to the
Anastasio one I used in medium brown and
I'm wearing it today I'm going to show a
demo right now of me applying this and
how these work if you're curious and so
let's go ahead and get into that and
then afterwards I'll talk about the pros
and cons of whether or not I think these
are any good so I am going to go ahead
and take off both caps what I like is
that right away the actual pencil can go
all the way into it so you don't
accidentally like get some in the lip
when you're putting it on and it is a
little bit thicker of a pencil then like
the Anastacio one is it's to a point
right now but you know it won't always
be so I'm just going to start the way I
always do and just do little light
strokes on the very bottom of my brows
here and this is darker than I would
typically used but the one that was the
next shade lighter than this pulled a
little bit too red for my taste
so I didn't end up wanting to use that
for this and I'm just gonna everything
else I'm just going to fill in lightly
you
so you can see right away that this is a
lot darker that I would typically do and
what I always do and what most people do
is they'll take a spoolie and this one
comes with one like most do and just
brush through it to kind of spread that
color throughout but also to lighten it
just a little bit make it look a little
bit more natural you know a lot of times
I'll just use the tip to kind of get rid
of anything that got too far onto my
skin that's not necessarily following my
brow hairs so now I'm going to do it to
the other side
you
now what I usually do is bring it out
just a little bit this way just because
I am more sparse when it comes to the
edge of my brows so I'll bring that a
little bit farther out then my actual
hairs are just to make it look a little
more full and long and like I said this
actually is a little bit darker than I
typically use but I don't mind it
because it does it's not pulling red so
what I would typically do after this is
use some sort of clear brow gel
I really like the NYX control freak
because it's really inexpensive I like
the anasazi one too but it's like 20
something dollars and they're both they
both do the same thing so I'm just
brushing this through and then just
using the tip of it to kind of get the
hairs in the place that I want them to
be in and like something I need to kind
of trim my brows here soon
do the same thing over here use the tip
so as you can tell I think it worked
really well it is a little deeper that I
usually go for my brows I could go way
deeper if I wanted because my hair is
dark brown but I just have always gone a
little lighter because my brows are
naturally light as you can see but I do
feel that natural Brown is a really nice
one that it doesn't pull red or anything
like that the deep Brown that they sell
really is almost a black but when you
brush it out it lightens a lot so if you
have even deeper hair you would
definitely like that and then the taupe
one definitely pulls a little red but a
lot of people need that like if you're
blonde I think it would probably work
for you obviously the price point is a
huge pro for this two dollars I mean
it's nothing when I'm paying like twenty
one dollars for my Anastasia brow Wiz
that's similar packaging and like the
same shade but it's just way more
expensive this elf one like I said it's
two dollars and it's got the roll up on
one side and the spoolie on the other
and while the spoolie is way bigger than
a lot of the ones that are out there it
does a perfect job of combing through
and spreading out the color that I I
can't believe these are two dollars a
the lids are like they actually like
stay on they kind of snap on they don't
like fall off which some do so I'm very
thankful for that and I think that I
honestly I just can't believe these are
two dollars these really are good and it
has been so hard for me to find
a brow color that's cheaper than what
I'm paying but that actually is a right
match for me and I finally found one
I've been trying out the NYX one but I
need to get a different shade because
it's just not working for me right now
we're time for this
it doesn't budge all day I mean it just
doesn't move and I think that's true for
most eyebrow pencils but some of them
are almost too creamy where they would
just like rub off but this I love the
pencil form I mean that's what I've been
drawn to anyway but it doesn't move once
it's on it just stays put and then like
I use I always use a clear brow gel over
just to set it elf sells them too but I
haven't found one from ELF that I
totally love that works the same as the
other ones I use I really like that NYX
one but it just doesn't move the color
stays put it doesn't wander even if it's
in a place where I don't have like a lot
of hair it still stays put which I am
very thankful for overall what I
recommend these absolutely you cannot
beat this I would say one of the cons is
that it only has three colors so if you
don't find one you like I mean you're
kind of out of luck but for two dollars
I think it's worth trying and like you
saw with this bully it really does
soften it a lot so if you need one way
lighter than these you can really soften
them up the way you apply them and it's
certainly worth a shot
for two bucks a pop I mean that's like
buying a cheeseburger at McDonald's so
it's not like a huge investment and I
definitely definitely was impressed to
be honest with you guys hopefully this
review and demo was helpful for you guys
if you're interested in more of my ELF
reviews or just drugstore reviews and
demos in general I will link my playlist
below definitely subscribe for more and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
