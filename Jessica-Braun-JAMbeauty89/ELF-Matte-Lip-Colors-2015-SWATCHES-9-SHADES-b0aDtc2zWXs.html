going to be reviewing and swatching the
elf matte lip colors now these are three
dollars on elfs website I'm going to be
showing you swatches of nine of the
shades that they have they have a lot I
will have all the shades listed below in
the order I show you them but I will
also have a link so if you want to check
out the other shades they have that
maybe I don't own I can make that as
well thank you to all for sending me
these over the years for PR purposes I
swear I'd like slowly been collecting
these and I bought some of them myself
too but I love these so much they're so
cheap so let's go ahead and get into the
swatches and afterwards we'll talk about
the pros and cons whether or not I would
recommend these to you guys
so what I love about these are well I've
got a lot of things I love about them
they're so cheap $3 but not only that
they work is both a lip liner in a
lipstick they're so opaque they're so
creamy in a way that they're creamy so
that they glide onto your lips easily
but they're not so creamy that they're
sliding outside your lip line the one
downside to a lipstick is that you have
to for me at least if it's a darker
color like the one I'm wearing now I
would have to not only bring the
lipstick to touch up but I want to bring
the lip liner that I'm wearing with it
so now suddenly you're bringing two
whereas with these you just have the one
and it works for both and it never
crawls outside my lip line it's crazy
now a lot of people talk about how these
are a little bit drier of a formula
whereas like there's the Maybelline
matte lipsticks that are just a little
bit creamier and I do love those too but
they're almost like different products
because if I'm looking for something
that I'm going to put on and have on for
a few hours without being able to look
in the mirror does check to see if it
needs touched up I pick these I pick one
of these to wear all the time to work as
a teacher and just all the time on the
weekends like over going to dinner this
morning I went to breakfast and I wore
praline which is this beautiful kind of
fall type color but I knew that I could
drink coffee and while a little bit
would get on like the mug I knew that I
wouldn't need to touch it up it kind of
stained your lips in a way and it just
stays put I love these so let's talk
about the packaging it's really really
sleek and they all look the same but
it's got the color swatch here on the
end and the name on the end as well and
then when you open it it's kind of like
a pencil like bullet and what is nice
now I've never really used it but they
have this sharpener on the end and by
sharpen right it should be called a
shaper because you can put it in the end
and kind of twist it through it and it
reshapes it into more of a pencil like
shape so I think that's nice to have as
an option if you want it to stay pointed
you know especially if you're kind of
going around the lines of your lips you
want it to be pointed so you can be more
precise there's not really a noticeable
smell to these at all in fact I don't
know if
ever notice to smell no there's not they
have a huge shade range which i think is
fantastic and it's just nice if you're
trying to build up your collection and
you want to maybe branch out to get more
of like a berry color this is a great
one to get because if I'm wearing a
really deep or vibrant one of the two
colors I want to know that it's not
going to move because I'm already maybe
a little self-conscious about wearing it
out but I also don't want to be
self-conscious about it me looking like
a clown and having like it coming out
the corners or you know all those things
that could go wrong I want to be able to
trust the saying put and these I would
trust with that in fact I mentioned
these as a recommendation in my
drugstore wedding makeup video that I
talked about the makeup I wore for my
wedding these are fantastic and I would
absolutely recommend these for anything
where you need it to be long wearing
maybe special events like a way but also
prom or a dance you know whatever it
might be
these would be great so I think you know
that I would recommend these but
hopefully you enjoyed this video if you
did please subscribe I can link my elf
playlist where I've got all kinds of elf
reviews of tons of their products some
of them are hits some of them are misses
