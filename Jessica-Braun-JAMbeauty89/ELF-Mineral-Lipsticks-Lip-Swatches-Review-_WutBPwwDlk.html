be reviewing and swatching on the lips
the elf Studio mineral lipsticks these
are $5 on eyes lips face calm and they
sent them to me recently and I've got
seven of the colors and they're actually
how many did I count eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen different shades
they actually sell so I have about half
of the collection and I'm really excited
to show you these so let's go ahead and
get into all of the lip swatches so you
can see how these look I swatch the bolt
on my hand and on my lips and if you're
just wanting to see a certain color I
will link the timestamps of each color
below if you're just wanting to see that
so let's go ahead and get started
so the price point of these is $5 on
their website like I mentioned I'll link
it below the formula of these is
incredible I've tried a lot of the elf
lipsticks and of course I've tried tons
of high-end drugstore lipsticks just
across the board these are so creamy and
I will say there were a few shades that
weren't as creamy to think because their
mineral lipsticks
they just feel healthy on your skin and
after swatching all of these you'd think
my lips would be all torn up they
weren't they I just kept wiping it off
with a baby wipe and it was just wipe
off so easily and yet they would stay
put when you're wearing it so it's a
really weird mix I don't think they're
not like kiss proof well that wasn't the
best but they just stay put they're not
like running outside your lip line or
anything like that I was so impressed I
have to admit because some of the elf
lipsticks I've tried I didn't love these
are probably no these are definitely my
favorite elf lip product I am so excited
that I have so many colors to play with
because oh I'm so excited so I will say
some of the colors that on my skin tone
and on my lips I have very pigmented
lips naturally so some lip colors just
don't
someone is mowing bill on
this happens all the time so some of
these lip colors didn't look great on my
lips because my lips are really
pigmented naturally royal red for
example I did not like on my lips and I
you could probably even tell just
because that well first of all the
darker ones I do think you need a lip
liner with especially if you're like
mine my lips I feel like there's no like
line line on the outside of my lips over
here so that's something I struggle with
so if it's a darker color I really do
have to wear a lip liner with them so
the wear time on this is not I mean
fantastic
I would say I've been wearing for a few
hours and I've only reapplied at once
but of course this is a lighter color so
it's not going to be as obvious if it's
wearing off because it's closer to my
own natural lip color so keep that in
mind because they are moisturizing
they're not crazy long wearing however
if you've got a problem with chapped
lips or just like with matte lipsticks
that really kind of look just that
they're really drying on your lips and
that's a problem for me this is nice
because it is moisturizing you would
have to reapply it throughout the day so
if you know that's not an option you
want a lipstick that's gonna last a long
time these aren't the lipsticks for you
but if you know you're just wearing it
for a little bit or you don't mind
reapplying it honestly these feel really
good like lip balm so I don't mind
reapplying it then you will love these
but if you're looking for a long wearing
lipstick this is not the lipstick for
you so I always link elf coupons below
if you're interested a lot of times elf
will have promo codes and all kinds of
things where you can get 50% off the
whole site or 50% off studio products
which these are from their studio line
overall what I recommend these yes I
think they're really nice everyday
option for lipstick they've got a ton of
different colors I'm looking on the site
and I mean the other eight colors
they've got like one called natural
nymph which i think is supposed to be
like a really really nude color I don't
know but that's what it appears I mean
they've got and they've got a lot more
deep colors like a cheerful cherry ripe
rose a lot that I don't have that if you
like deeper colors they do have a lot
more options I got a lot of the lighter
ones which I'm excited about because I
like light lipsticks for me for everyday
but anyway Holi this review is helpful
for you

hauls and reviews and demos I will link
