going to share with you guys my thoughts
on the elf skin care line I've been
trying this stuff for so long and I've
done an initial review video last year
when they was it last year when they
first started doing skin care and so now
they've been doing it for a little bit
longer and they have some new amazing
products and there's some products that
I haven't tried that I'm going to
mention that I would like to try
eventually that you might want to check
out for yourself just because of what
they are and how and how that kind of a
product works so let's start with the
empty right here in front of me these
are their elf hydrating water sheet
masks now I've been suffering from dry
skin I say suffering it's not that deep
but I have had dry skin especially in
the winter and I've been snapchatting
about it a lot and you guys have given
me lots of recommendations on there and
I've been trying a few things but this
is one that I tried I've been really
into sheet masks this retails for $3
which I would say for sheet masks is
reasonable you can probably find cheaper
ones but they might not be as effective
this one impressed the heck out of me
because the actual mask stays on my face
there are so many I usually try to do
like I'm a weirdo I try to do like
push-ups and like sit-ups and stuff
while I'm wearing a mask just because
I'm like oh I want to do something the
other time I do it of course I might be
like in a bath or something but but
usually I try and do something while I'm
wearing it and of course with push-ups
I'm facing down gravity is working
against me so the masks all all the
masks I've tried actually stay on but
this one doesn't move like it's made of
some kind of special fiber something
that it actually fits my face and
doesn't budge and like a lot of them
like there's just too much so you're
kind of bunching it up and then it just
slides and it's like on your lips or
it's like in your eye I mean this one
actually fit really well it's one of the
very few that actually do and I was like
oh it's gonna be elf and you never know
it's more inexpensive maybe they're
going to cut corners no this one was
amazing so I can't wait to get more of
these and try them out
like every week if not like twice a week
because it was hydrating it's taking
place I was so impressed so impressed so
definitely need to get more of those um
another product I can't stop talking
about I've even told my friends and
family about it is they're hydrating
bubble masks now
this is meant to be hydrating and of
course that's what I'm looking for but
what you do is you just push this down
the gel comes up into it and on a damp
face you put that all over you wait a
couple seconds a couple minutes and it
starts to foam so you have like this
foam mask on your face and it doesn't
foam so much that it's like blooping off
your face it stays in place but it foams
- probably like a centimeter of foam and
it's hydrating it feels really cool and
it just my skin looks nice after using
it now I will say I think this is more
hydrating than this but if you pair them
together it's like gold so I love those
this one is a little more expensive at
$14 but you can get a ton of uses out of
it and you know when I think about
really expensive masks that are like 40
or 50 dollars for this size that is a
really good deal so two other products
I've fallen in love with this is their
nourishing night cream and their
illuminating eye cream now my only gripe
is that it's in a tub if you will or a
jar and that's not great for the
ingredients because you know skin like
right now air is getting into it light
is getting into it and sometimes that
can mess with the ingredients in it um
and of course the idea is that you're
going to use it up before it really
would matter anyway
but for me I like to try a lot of
different skincare so sometimes it takes
me a while to go through something so
that's my only gripe and of course
you're dipping your fingers into it
first is like if it's in a tube or a
pump
you're squeezing it so you're not
touching the product getting germs in it
um there's a lot of skincare that's in
pots um and there's a lot that I like
that's in a pot I just wish more people
would do squeezy tubes with things like
this but I really like the nourishing
night cream it's just you know like I
said just an ice cream I think it's just
a standard night cream I don't think
it's the best I've ever used and I don't
think it's most moisturizing however I
love the eye cream it says illuminating
and it really is like more of a pure
white not that that matters but like if
you compare it to their night cream you
can see the difference although the
light might but yeah this is more of
like a pure white it really does make my
under eye look so nice like I don't
really know how to describe it now I
usually only use it at night but I've
started putting eye cream on in the
mornings as well and I really think it's
making a difference like in the
crepeiness under my
I and you know I'll get dry skin like
I'm like the corner of my eye does
anyone else get that and I'm like wow
how is it even happening like what is
that from
and I really feel like this has really
tackled that so I love this eye cream so
much the eye cream by the way is $10 off
links and prices for all this down below
the nourishing night cream is $12 so um
great so the next thing I want to
mention this is one that I looked at and
was like how am I ever going to use that
and then I started using it I'm like oh
and now I can't live without it and I've
even gotten this for some friends of
mine this is their cleansing duo face
brush now I don't use this every day to
cleanse my face so if you didn't want to
buy like one of those really expensive
facial cleansing brushes which I do like
and I use from time to time I'm not
using currently I don't use this for
that purpose although you could like
wipe your cleanser off I use this to get
masks off my face not sheet masks but
like masks I put on I'll use this kind
of like rubbery side so if I'm using a
really thick kind of chunky mask this
does a great job of getting it out of
like those little areas of my face that
it's so hard like I'll use water over
and over an Oregon won't come off this
tackles that and then I'll use this for
a more moisturizing mask that I'm using
just to kind of get it off of my face
but also kind of get it into my skin I
love this tool and I did not think that
I would so I was totally blown away this
one is $14 but again you're probably not
gonna have to replace it very often if
you use it everyday you might want to
just cuz I would assume these brush
hairs might get dirty you know and you
might clean it but yeah you might want
to replace from time to time but that
was such a whole product so the next
product is their exfoliating scrub and
this stuff I like it's not I don't think
it's my favorite scrub but I'm going to
be honest I feel like I haven't found an
exfoliating scrub that I'm like totally
in love with so this is something I've
been keeping actually in my shower and
when I just feel like I want to cleanse
my face really quickly and kind of
exfoliate a little bit um but it's I
don't want it to be that deep I'm not
gonna leave it on or anything this is
perfect I almost there there are tiny
tiny granules in it um
and so it really it's like a micro
exfoliate it's not really getting rid of
a bunch but it it does feel nice
kind of like that it's not too rough
because if I'm using it every day or
even every other day you know I don't
want it to be too rough on my skin so
it's kind of the just right amount if
you've got like a lot of problems you
need a lot of exfoliation I don't think
this is the one for you but if you just
kind of need just light exfoliation from
time to time I think you'll actually
really like it so just depends on your
preference but I've been keeping this in
my shower and I liked having it in there
and the packaging of all this stuff is
so cute I really do like this light kind
of light green just a very calming kind
of spa-like color I really like the
choice they made with that first thing
is their daily hydration moisturizer
this is actually the second one of these
I've had because I went through it um
this is just the perfect everyday
moisturizer it's not going to change
your skin when it comes to you know if
you've got really dry skin like I do
it's not going to completely get rid of
it so I again it's not like a crazy
moisturizer but it is a nice one and so
I would use this every single morning I
would just throw it on my skin before
putting makeup on and then at night I
would use a much deeper cream
moisturizer so again I would say I don't
think this will do enough if you have
really dry skin like me to completely
fix it but I do think it's nice and it's
nice and lightweight under your skin and
I love that it's in a container and
there's a well they're all in containers
I love that it's in a tube and it's got
a pump and then that pump even has a lid
so if I'm traveling with it it's not
going to get all over the place I love
that the last part I'm gonna mention is
their hydrating gel mask now this I
think does a lot better at hydrating my
skin then then the bubble mask I like
the bubble mask for the experience but
this is way more hydrating so this is
one that you leave on for 10 minutes on
your face and it really is like a creamy
gel like formula and then you instead of
like rinsing it off you actually just
tissue it off so then anything left on
your face is like almost like a
moisturizer that's just gonna seep into
your skin so this like I envisioned this
like you know with math sheet masks
that's a similar feel to it but the mask
is holding it on your face and then you
kind of rub it on but this you just
leave on without the mask and
and you just tissue off what's XS so a
very similar idea behind it I really do
like this a lot and in the winter it's
kind of been a godsend for me I really I
really do like it now I think if you
don't have super dry skin you probably
don't need this so I have my iPad here
and I'm wanting to mention other
products that I want to try you guys are
gonna laugh at me because or maybe you
won't but I went to an elf event that
they invited me to a couple months ago
would have so fun like amazing I have
the vlog I can like if you wanted to see
kind of behind the scenes of that and
how it was just awesome but they gave us
a bunch of skincare in our hotel room
and I was so excited and I showed you in
the vlog what it was and I had to leave
literally all except for I think this
brush behind because I had to fly home
and I had no room I was just carrying on
I didn't check any bags and I'd really
didn't want to pay you know the 30 hours
to check my bag because I just didn't
want to so I left all of it behind I was
like oh my gosh so I just I'm like
hoping that the maid that cleaned the
hotel room was like ooh and like kept it
because I felt terrible I think I maybe
fit like one other thing like maybe in
my clear bag for the carry-on but
everything else had to leave behind so I
don't remember exactly what was in that
all the stuff they gave and they've sent
me some stuff cents as well but one
thing I want to try is they're hydrating
gel melt cleanser and that retails for
ten dollars I'll show you a picture I
mean it it the packaging just looks just
like these do but it says it's supposed
to transform from a gel to a creamy oil
that helps dissolve makeup and cleanse
the skin so it reminds me of like the it
cosmetics gel like makeup remover stuff
I love that stuff so much and it's such
a great way to get your makeup off
without like tugging at your skin and
using like a wife to pull um it just
looks really awesome another thing I
want to try is their hydrating water
essence and I think it's just like a
what does it say oh so it's not it for
some reason I was thinking it was a
spray but it says it glides on the skin
leaving skin feeling refreshed it's got
purified water coconut water algae and
coffee um so I guess it's like an oh
it's like a toner does in essence so
that sounds just awesome they also have
like I really like the elf
regular cleansing cloths but they have
their hydrating water cleansing cloths
that are in like that kind of mint type
bag similar packaging but just a
different color I'd be interested to try
that and see how different it is from
the regular ones as well they also have
some like kits you could get they have
like their basics kit which has four
different products in it it's like $42
though but I guess that probably saves
you money rather than buying the four
products together and of course the elf
has a lot of like 20% off sales or free
shipping or whatever so I mean I would
say wait for a sale like that so that
you can take advantage of that and they
have other kits as well they have an AM
and a PM kit so yeah so they've got all
kinds of things I got it I could look at
their website all day but hopefully this
gave you some food for thoughts and
things that maybe you do want to try if
you've got dry skin a regular skin
whatever depending on your needs that's
the thing about skin are all of our skin
is so different I mean even to people
with dry skin could still need very
different products so keeping that in
mind I hope that what I shared with you
was helpful and you know there's a lot
of other elf skin care review videos on
YouTube if you just search I mean
there's a ton so if you want to hear
maybe from someone that's got a
different skin type than me that might
be a good idea just so you really have a
good idea on what you're going to spend
your money on or if you're gonna spend
your money on it so I hope that you'll
