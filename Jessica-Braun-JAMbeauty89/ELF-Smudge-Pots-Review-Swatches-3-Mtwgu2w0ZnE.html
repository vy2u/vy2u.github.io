bringing you a review of the elf smudge
pots these can be found on their website
and there are $3 apiece and they look
like this and the packaging that they
come in they all have white lids and
they seem pretty sturdy I've had these
for a little while now and I've traveled
with some of these and they've kind of
withstood the test of travel which is
always my biggest indicator Packaging
wise if it's well made enough to last
for a long time the texture of these
smudge pots is very whipped and the more
I've used it the more I've realized that
these are a lot softer than the Mac
Paint Pots and the Maybelline Color
tattoos any of those types of cream
shadows are a lot more dense and you get
a you have to rub it to get a little bit
on your finger whereas with this you can
almost yeah I mean you can rub to get
some out but you can almost dig it out
as well so it's a lot a lot softer than
other cream shadows that I've used the
way that these are meant to be used is
either on their own just as like an
all-over wash of color which is what I
did today on mine you can also use them
as a primer underneath shadow which is
typically how I would use a cream shadow
especially with these or any other thing
like that
they are meant to hold on to the shadow
to add a little bit of color but the
idea is that they don't move that they
don't budge all day now
what I've noticed with these they have 9
different shades on their website and
I'm staring at them right now i elf sent
me all of them I ended up giving away
the rest of them but the ones that I
have left are just the lighter colors
because that's usually what I go for
when I'm using a cream shadow because I
like I said I usually use them as a
primer the ones that I still have are
back to basics which is this really
pretty kind of bronze color I also have
ain't that sweet which is a really light
pink color and it reminds me of Mac the
Mac Paint Pot in let's skate although
it's not as Glary as that I also have
pearls of wisdom which is this really
silvery white
very pure white color and I also have
got a glow which is this golden shade it
reminds me of Urban Decay's half-baked
at least color wise it does out of these
you can tell which ones I've used the
most which would be gotta glow and also
back to basics I've gotten a decent
amount of use out of especially lately
these don't really have a noticeable
smell or anything offensive like that
which I appreciate the pigmentation on
these when you swatch them they look
absolutely stunning however you notice
as you start to blend it out that they
begin to look a lot less pigmented and
that is the one Cod that I found with
these is that when I'm applying it with
my fingers which I would prefer to for
cream shadow I've noticed that they just
sheer out so much no matter alike I
today layered on like four layers of the
gada glow and it didn't really I mean in
person it looks a little bit more
pigmented than on camera because the
lighting kind of washes me out here but
it isn't as stark as I would prefer
especially with the gold shade now like
I said today I just wore it on its own
and it's okay underneath shadows is
where it really shines because these do
not budge I had swatched got a glow
earlier this morning before I went got
ready because I remembered this being
the case when I first got these I went
after I did my makeup I went and washed
my hands and scrubbed this area and it
would not come off now once I got a
makeup remover wipe it came right off
but what I love is the staying power of
these shadows it really is incredible so
although I wouldn't necessarily
recommend it for just all over because I
really don't know that it's necessarily
pigmented enough just for that I would
recommend them as a primer because they
really do hold onto any shadow you put
on top of it
all of these do a great job I would
recommend the white one pearls of wisdom
for if you're doing a bright look like
bright colors this white underneath
those bright colors is gonna really
really make them pop it's kind of the
same with nail polish if you put a white
nail polish on and then you just put a
an opaque glitter topcoat that glitter
is gonna pop just that much more because
of the white base underneath it so that
the same holds true for cream shadows so
that's how I would recommend using the
white one like I said when you apply it
with your fingers it really does shear
out a lot even when you're packing it on
after letting it dry and putting more on
letting it dry buddy we're on it really
does shear out however the one brush
that I found that does a really good job
of packing it on if you want to keep it
that opaque color is the elf flat
eyeliner brush and this is just a brush
that's synthetic really almost rubbery
feeling but it does a great job with
cream products especially their smudge
pots because you can pick up a lot of
the color and you can really really get
it all over the lid and let it dry that
way and it's a lot thicker it's a lot
more opaque so that's kind of how I've
found that's like the way I've found to
work around the fact that it shears out
with my fingers now if you're someone
that's looking for a cream shadow that
is pretty sheer that's just a nice light
wash of color you will love these but if
you are looking for something that's
like shockingly pigmented and goes on
exactly the way it swatches you might
not love these as much when you wear it
all day I haven't noticed any weird
feeling like as you're wearing it it
doesn't feel sticky it dries almost as
if it's a powder I mean it just dries
down and it stays and you don't feel and
it doesn't feel sticky I have not
noticed any creasing with it and that's
another big thing with some cream
shadows they just crease like crazy and
they look really gross these do not
change they really don't the way it
applies once it has dried is the way it
will look at the end of the day and
that's what I've noticed repeatedly with
these so where time and the way that it
wears it will stay the same as it was
when you first applied it and that is
amazing for a $3 product as I said these
you can we purchase on eyes lips face
calm you can sometimes find these in
stores i buy some elf products from
Target I also have a story of me called
Meyer that sells elf although most of
the good smudge pot colors are usually
sold out they're like the lighter ones
that I would really gravitate towards
online the one downside of ordering
online is that you usually will have to
pay for shipping but Alfonzo
has some sort of deal where like if you
spend $25 you can get free shipping or
you know all kinds of things like that I
will have a link for elf coupons below
because they change so often this link
will always give you the most updated
ones overall my rating the pros would be
that they're inexpensive there's a
pretty decent color range and they goes
to a lot of darker color so if you're
into that definitely check on their site
so you can see they've got like a deep
purple and a deep blue and lots of other
crazier and more fun colors I think that
the wear time is absolutely amazing the
one con I would say is just that it
really is sheer when you apply it with
your fingers which is how I would prefer
to apply it but like I said there are
ways to work around that and this brush
is I think three dollars on their
website as well so I mean absolutely
amazing if you're interested in more elf
products or more elf ideas of products
that are really good and maybe some elf
products that really aren't so good I'll
link my past elf videos I've done quite
a few on my channel because I love elf
and although I own a decent amount of
high-end I always find myself going back
to elf because they're just for the
price you can't beat it really they
really do sell some amazing products so
if you're interested in learning a
little more about elf or maybe what
products to avoid because there are some
that really are no good and some
products that are absolutely amazing
that I rave about I'll put those links
below if you're interested please
subscribe for more reviews and I'll
catch you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
