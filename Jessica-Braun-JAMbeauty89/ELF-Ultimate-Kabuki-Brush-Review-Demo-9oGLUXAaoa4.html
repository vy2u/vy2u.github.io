review of the elf ultimate kabuki brush
now this is retailing for $10 right now
on elfs website and they sent it to me
and I when I saw it I was like I've got
to review this this is hilariously
awesome because it looks like the Becca
brush I want to say it's called like the
one brush or something like that I don't
own it but it's really really pricey
which is why I don't own it but this one
looks like it's about the same size this
brush is incredibly soft $10 is kind of
pricey for an elf product and that's why
I was like when I finally like looked it
up online after they said to me I was
like $10 but at the same time it is
really well-made this is made of like
wood the handle is and it's really
really huge so I have a demo of me using
this to apply my contouring blush which
I have on today so let me go ahead and
show you that and then we'll get into
kind of the nitty-gritty details of this
okay so I've got my little elf ultimate
kabuki brush here and you guys like
size-wise this is like the size of my
entire cheek like the this is a huge
brush and the length of it is as long as
my cheek and like if I were to hold it
here like where I'd put my contour it's
all I mean it's the size of your contour
maybe even longer so it is huge and I
kind of laughed when I got it because
it's so incredibly soft but all I kept
thinking was like I could just go to
church and have my entire face done like
it's huge
I'm gonna use my Kevin tequan sculpting
powder and medium just because that's a
favorite it's really expensive I know
but it's my favorite some cheaper
alternatives that I like this is the
pixie subtley Sun touched bronzer and
it's a similar gray toned it's a little
bit more warm toned but it's similar and
I really like that I also like this is
an elf blush but it's in koi now this
one has some shimmer to it and again
it's not as cool tone but it's nice and
then I also why I have a whole video on
it but the Aesthetica contour kit
there's this color right here this is
like a perfect dupe for the Anastasi one
this color right here is like the exact
same can you guys tell I mean it's
almost the exact same so you could use
any of them I'm going to use my
personal favorite so this is truly a
first impression because I've never used
this and I this could go on terribly so
I'm just gonna start with a little bit
and you see that there is a little bit
on my brush I'm gonna tap off a little
bit there we go so it certainly that's
going a little low no it looks fine I
mean I think huh
I mean it the problem is you really
don't have control so I'm thinking for
contouring purposes if you were wanting
a true true contour this is not ideal
because it's not controlled it's very
big very fanned out but if you're like
me I'm not doing like a contour like I'm
just doing kind of a not I don't want to
say a sloppy contour but just kind of a
more natural one where it just there is
a little bit of darkness in the hollow
but it's not you know what I mean it's
not makeup artist perfect like
photographed so for that purpose I think
this is fine I think ideally it's just
ideal for bronzing up your face so I'm
gonna take this contour shade and all
bronze up my face a little bit too I
mean you see it does work fine and it's
kind of foolproof but again it's huge so
you don't want to go in with some crazy
dark color and expect it to be perfect
because it's just not gonna be it's huge
can I say that enough so I'm going to go
ahead and use the same color to kind of
bronze up the top and I'm keeping the
darker color here and at the tops but
not here because that's like a highlight
area if you wanted to highlight you get
a little bit more for the other side
and then of course you can take it down
here I mean this would be ideal for like
um like bronzing up your body you know
what I mean it's so honestly you guys
this is kind of nice I mean it's like I
said you don't want to do a really dark
color but I am impressed with the way
that it applied it and it certainly
didn't um I don't know like it it really
does a good job of blending it out I'm
really surprised now I had the ELF
regular kabuki brush for a while but I
never used it because it was kind of the
same size as a powder brush and I was
like well why not just use a powder
brush that I love where I've got a
handle otherwise I'm you know so for me
I really didn't use kabuki brushes but
this one I mean I really like that this
might make its way into even my makeup
bag when I travel and that's how you
know I like it because I'm really picky
about what I travel with so I think it
does a really nice job of contouring
slash bronzing if you're not looking for
a really precise contoured look so
really it's just bronzing but I really
like it you guys what do you think so
clearly I was a little bit surprised as
to how well this worked at applying my
bronzer contour and mostly just because
of the size I thought it's just gonna be
so sloppy but it kind of made it look a
lot more natural and nice I think now of
course now I've applied blush on top of
it and highlight and things like that
but I have been struggling to really
find a brush that I've liked for that
purpose and I'll use maybe one that's
more like a powder blue more like a
powder brush or I'll use like let me see
if I can find it here I'll use like a
giant fan brush like I've got this one
from Sedona lace and it's really big but
I noticed that it's still pretty thin
and so it would just be like a stripe no
matter what I did no matter how I did
this whereas this one's a little bit
thicker and it kind of just makes it
look really natural I could not believe
that it does such an amazing job at
blending in the skin now you could also
use this for powder a powder foundation
because it is really thick I mean you
can use it all over and apply powder
foundation
with it if you wanted because it is so
dense but beyond that similar products
like I mentioned the Beca one is similar
a lot of people are getting into these
really thin contouring brush is like
NARS has one this is one from diva
beauty but it's so thin that it's great
for if you want a very precise contour
but for everyday I don't want a precise
contour I don't want to look like I'm
100% made-up I'm a teacher so this is so
perfect to giving that natural look I'm
so excited to use this over the summer
when I'm like bronzing and stuff and I
do have a feeling I know I mentioned it
I probably will travel with this sucker
because it is amazing and it's you know
you can use it in different ways you
could use it for powder you can use it
for your bronzer things like that
overall would I recommend this product
yes I think ten dollars is not that a
bad of a price for something that is as
well made as this is I wish you guys
could feel it and I wish you could feel
even the base this wooden base it's so
well made it's so useful and it feels
like a high-end brush that's what I'll
say it feels like the Mac brushes that I
own just really really nice soft but
actually works at blending something
into your skin in the right way so yes I
would recommend this a lot of times on
their site does have a lot of sales or
like you know spend $25 you get free
shipping I'll put a link below with elf
coupons I can also link my other elf
videos because I have a ton of elf
videos where i review tons of their
products my favorites and then things
that I think are terrible just across
the board a lot of elf has found its way
to my collection and a lot of them I
love and some of them I hate so if
you're interested in finding out about
more elf videos I'll put those links
below other than that I hope you found
this review helpful and if you enjoyed
