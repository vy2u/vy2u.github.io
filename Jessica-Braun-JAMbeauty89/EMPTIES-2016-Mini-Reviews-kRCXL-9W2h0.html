going to share with you guys a ton of
products that I have just finished up
that I wanted to share with you guys
kind of many reviews on every single
thing just to give you an idea of you
know if I'm use the whole product up
I've got a pretty good idea of whether I
liked it I you know it's kind of
wishy-washy or I hated it so let's go
ahead and get into it let's get into the
makeup first cuz I figure you'd rather
see that and using a makeup is kind of
more of a big deal than using up body
hair skin care etc so we'll start with
that the first thing I have used up is
the NYX HD blush in snow HD blush in
taupe and obviously it's more of a
bronzer II contour type shade now this
isn't completely gone but it's kind of
gotten to that point where it's just a
little bit weird to use and I'm like I
mean I have enough that I I'm okay with
getting rid of this at this point
this one was weird because I loved it
for a long time but it's kind of I
realized it's very powdery and it kind
of like whether you use a brush your
finger although I don't really whether
i'm swatching with my finger or it's a
brush I feel like it pills up into tiny
little chunks of powder in the weirdest
way and honestly I've never really
experienced that with any other brand
but NYX I've experienced it with
numerous times but this is one of the
products I've experienced it with and
I've heard a similar thing about like
their contour palette but I've never
tried it so I don't really know but this
one I really did like it because for a
drugstore option it is an awesome
contour color whoo chunk of it just fell
out what else is new
but when i recommend it as like an
amazing product no but what i recommend
it as a pretty good one yes but i think
that it's just that kind of that weird
consistency that i can't rank it as like
best of the best kind of a thing but I
do like mixes HD blushes in general like
I feel like the ones that are like blush
colors are much better than
like that one I also used up two
different cream liners now one of them
just dried up
it's the L'Oreal lacquer liner from the
infallible line and it's just in
blackest black it dried up because I had
started using another one that I loved
which I'll show you in a second and so
this one I mean it's really just
unusable I've tried and I can't but I
love this is probably the third one of
the lacquer liner I tried this one's
amazing the Maybelline eye studio cream
liner is amazing as well they're both
like I'll just go between those cuz
they're both amazing but I found a new
love and I might have to finally place
an online order because don't you guys
feel that when it's an online brand
maybe I'm weird if it's an online only
brand I'm much less likely to just order
it but like it's mica beauty that it's
from the brand mica beauty and it's an
online brand and since I can't find it
in stores near me and it's not available
on like Ulta or Sephora websites like
that I will not order it I mean it's
terrible but it's so hard for me to just
place an order on a brand's website I
don't know what's wrong with me but I
feel like I should get bang for my buck
with shipping so I'm like well if I'm
gonna play somewhere online I should
like order you know a bunch of different
things to try out whatever to get free
shipping or just to make it worth the
shipping cost but this might be worth
ordering just for this one product so
it's the mica Beauty cosmetics gel
eyeliner in black it's a very creamy
wipey kind of gel eyeliner whereas the
Lory on the Maybelline ones are a little
bit thicker so it's I don't even want to
say dryer because they're not
necessarily drier but they're just
bigger but this is a really thin creamy
consistency but it's so black that you
don't need a really like you don't have
to layer it a bunch of times I love this
stuff it's almost gone which is why I'm
showing it I know I don't know if it
looks full or not it's almost gone I
even use it today I'm scraping this
sucker till the bottom but I love it I
think I will just order it again if I
can I'll find it online and link it
below if you're interested too but
another thing I used up is the elf
makeup remover it's just a
little like almost penlight thing I've
actually flipped it around you can take
it out flip it around that you can use
to kind of clean up
we've liner you know if you get weird
specs on your face you can just use it
to remove the makeup it's awesome these
are three bucks I use them up like candy
you don't use up can you eat the candy
but I really do go through these like
crazy so I have five mascaras that I've
used up that's crazy
the first one was in in some
subscription box and it's the duche or
do you say Punk volumizer mascara and I
actually really liked this it I could
probably get a couple more uses out of
it I have like big brushes if you don't
like big brushes you'll hate this but I
don't mind them I didn't love him for my
lower lash line it kind of clumped but
it was it was super volumizing on the
top so I liked it when I buy again this
is another brand you'd have to like buy
online specifically and I don't think I
loved it that much the next one honestly
I didn't use up but it's waterproof and
I just can't it pulls out my lashes this
is the L'Oreal voluminous superstar in
waterproof and the first side is a
primer and it was okay but you'll see it
starts to get you know like if you have
any liner in your waterline and you use
this it picks up the liner and pulls it
through so it ends up getting black all
over it which I mean that's kind of to
be expected but then the second side of
course is the mascara but since it's
waterproof
I just stopped using it I did not like
it did not make my lashes look nice I
will say that the primer was okay I
would use the primer with other mascaras
so that one's almost used up anyway but
I just didn't love it I would be willing
to try a non waterproof version because
I love the idea of primers with it and
while I'm on that token I'm going to
skip all go back to mascaras but this is
another one I would be willing to buy
online straight up this is the manic
Adar conditioning lash primer this is
just a trial size I want the full size I
think it might be expensive though I
need to look it up but it's just a white
primer you guys there is something about
this that works incredibly it thickens
your lashes but it doesn't have any
weird like fibers or weird fallout
and it just makes your lashes huge so
then you put whatever mascara on top but
I feel like any mascara I used with this
always looked awesome no matter what so
I mean I was floored because I've never
found a lash primer that I love so I
really again this one in the mica gel
liner I need to actually order again the
next one I tried out and kind of used up
is the Maybelline the falsies push-up
drama I did not love this it's got
really separated little those things
vibrant not fibers little arms I don't
know what do we call those I don't know
but it just didn't do well and really
the main thing I remember from this was
that my lashes which normally are semi
curl just naturally were straight and I
was like this has never happened I mean
it's just crazy so if you already have
straight lashes they're gonna be like
even lower like it was weird so I used
it for probably a couple weeks and I was
like I am done I ain't hated it another
mascara I finished up is the Maybelline
full and soft I really liked this it was
a very natural mascara very natural
brush and it just was comfortable and
light throughout the week when I'm going
to work I just want to wear a
comfortable mascara it looks nice but
it's not like crazy volume I just liked
it if there's a reason this has been
around for quite some time another one I
finished up is the Jordana best lash
extreme one of my favorites crazy
volumizing holds a curl defining as well
like it does all the three things you
want to see volume definition and like
curl it does all of them it's insanely
cheap under five dollars and it's just
great I also used up two brow gels
they're both clear so I'll do the
expensive one than the cheap one the
expensive one I used up is the Anastasia
clear brow gel this really is like
hairspray for your brows like it just
when you brush it through it your
browser's don't move all day and I love
that about it and even though it's like
20 bucks ish I end up I mean I've gone
through like three of these because it
really does hold
than anything I've ever use of course
you literally could take a spooly
hairspray it and then brush it through
it's gonna have a similar effect but
honestly I'm just lazy but I've also
tried the NYX control freak and this is
the second one of these iPads and I also
really like this it's an amazing like $5
ish option again you brush it through
your brows just to hold them in place
it's not as strong of a hold but it's
still pretty good and the reality is you
don't always want like crunchy brows you
know what I mean so I feel like for an
everyday like comparing the two I end up
using this one just a little more often
because it doesn't look crunchy or
anything like that
one last mascara so I guess it's ugly
kind of sick so this is the unique set
someone sent to me I feel like a million
years ago this stuff should have gone
bad a million years ago but it hasn't
this is the transplanting gel so it's
the unique white two-step system where
you put the transplanting gel on which
is kind of like a black mascara then you
put the white fiber II type things on
which I kept because it's fine and then
you put the gel back on top so it's kind
of like layered in and it's just crazy
volumize the first five times I use this
it really was amazing you guys it was
amazing but I realized I didn't love
this but I love the fiber so I'm just
using that fiber when I really want
crazy lashes with regular mascara and I
realized honestly it does the same thing
if not even better if you found a best
carrier you love so just keep that in
mind but I really do like the fibers and
I don't that was loud I will say you'll
notice it can get really weird like down
here if you use it so I don't like to
use it on my lower lash line at all I
don't even know if that's recommended
because it was just weird there so I'm
just a little piece of advice now on to
hair care and skin care and body care
one thing I used up I feel like a
million years ago but I guess I have not
done an empties video in a very long
time
is the julep barefaced cleansing oil
this was okay it removed I should say I
liked it clear
I used it up it removed my makeup the
way I wanted it to and I really only use
this stuff mostly just for my eyes
because the rest of it will come off
pretty easily with just a cleanser but I
liked it enough would I buy it again
no I think it's too expensive for what
it is and honestly I've really been
liking using like Bioderma or even like
the Garnier type micellar water just to
quickly remove that and then wash my
face this I don't know I just it was
okay another thing I used up that I I'm
torn about this is the Andalou naturals
pumpkin honey glycolic mask this is on
Vitacost
that's where I bought it for cheaper
than it is regularly priced which that's
why I love aya costs they have tons of
like natural skincare things for way
cheaper than it is on like in Whole
Foods anywhere else it's so much cheaper
so we Tyler and I like even for
groceries well-placed Vitacost ordered
every single month and just set on the
floor and open our box with like spices
and skincare and just all kinds of stuff
so if you're interested I'll link it
below I think if it still works which
I'm pretty sure it does I'll
double-check I have a $10 off coupon
where like if you use my link I get $10
off you get $10 off it's like a win-win
so if I still have that link I'll link
it below but I loved this stuff but I
will say it it smells exactly like
pumpkin and honey which I love because I
feel like it's actually made from those
products but it didn't make my skin
sting but it also made my skin look
really brightened I cannot describe it
it's the weirdest thing like it really
did sting and you leave it on what is it
says one to three times per week you
leave it out for 10 minutes and it looks
like baby food I remember a long time
ago when I first this is like the third
bottle I've gone through this when I
first got one of these I posted a
picture on Instagram if I can find it
I'll put it up there but I posted a
picture on Instagram of me wearing this
and it literally looks like baby food
like and I'm sure a lot of you guys know
what I mean but it's stung but my skin
looked amazing so I can't
it was like good for my skin bath race I
don't know but almost thing is this is
the third one of these I've gone through
and I really liked it so I'll link this
below another thing I used up is the
polished choice resist moisturizer I've
used the entire resist line I really
really like it it's great if you're
around my age like mid-20s although now
I just turned 27 but because it's you
know it's not necessarily for mature
mature skin but you know you're you're
starting to see the signs of aging of
starting to see crow's feet and the idea
of the resist line is exactly that so I
like it there are some products I like
more than others in the Polish choice
but the resist line is among my
favorites for sure for my skin type and
it's really helped I used to have crazy
dry skin and now I would say I just have
normal skin so you don't want the wait
I'll see a little bit of dryness like
here but it's so much less than what I
used to see so I feel like I have to
attribute it to this so not I mean not
just this moisturizer but the whole line
but I like the moisturizer I've done a
sponsored video with them I want to say
it was almost a year ago it doesn't feel
like a year ago but and this was one
that I felt so strongly about I really
really loved it I finally used this up
it's amazing
another one I stopped using and I know
if you use this you're gonna like be
like what this is the Cetaphil daily
facial cleanser if you have oily skin
this is going to be amazing for you
because it really does you know across
the board it cleans your face it gets
makeup off your face feels clean I
started using this and I realized you
know a couple weeks passed and my skin
was crazy dry it and this wasn't in the
wintertime so I couldn't even contribute
it to that I was like in the fall and it
really wasn't that cold here in the fall
I realized this was the only variable
that had changed so you know I used it
probably to here but I realized my skin
was drying out so if you boil this game
you really would probably like it if you
have drier skin it could be hit or miss
and it really I mean all of our skin is
so different I didn't think it was
terrible but I just didn't want to use
anything else that was super drying I
really like the moisture
I think cleanser from CeraVe so really
similar I always confuse the two but the
CeraVe cer a ve again I'll link all this
stuff below but the moisturizing
cleanser is amazing if you already have
try skin or even normal skin it feels
amazing your skin will look amazing I
love it I need to I think now that I'm
done with this I might purchase that now
because I love that stuff so much
alright a nail empty is the cute ex non
acetone nail polish remover I mean I
think this actually worked pretty well
and I like the idea of using less
acetone because I know it's drying but
honestly any of these are drying I mean
it's not natural to put anything on your
nails if you really think about it but
this remove things really well I didn't
wear glitter polish I don't know if I
wore like I might have worn it a couple
times but not much this past year so I
haven't had a need for a really strong
nail polish remover the one I have now
it's a green one I don't think it's to
text but it's for like removing gel
polish or glitter and it's really strong
and I can feel it drying my nails out so
I feel like I need to buy this again I
like that it's non acetone just so it's
a little more gentle it's still not
perfect but it's just a little more
gentle on your nails and my nails are
just so dry and they break so easily no
matter how many vitamins I take water I
drink it just doesn't seem to make a
difference so I don't know so let's talk
about hair and then we'll do skin so so
here empties they're both from living
proof they send me these a long time ago
and I told you guys like I don't I tell
companies basically and if you're
another youtuber this might help you
basically what I tell companies is you
can send me whatever you want but I'm
not guaranteeing that I'm gonna do a
review or that I'm gonna show it if I
love it it might happen to be a video
because I love it but if I don't you
know it might be in a regrets video it
might be you know because if I don't
like it I'm gonna be honest with you
guys so of course these I both loved so
this is the living proof curl defining
styling cream I should have wore my hair
naturally curly today so well my hair is
actually curly wavy whatever you want to
call it it's not like kinky curls like
it's kind of a mix this stuff was
amazing and right now on my shower I
could probably show today too because
they're almost gone I have the living
proof curl shampoo and conditioner and
the difference between when I use that
versus when I use you know any other
shampoo conditioner what I'm wearing my
hair naturally curly is astronomical
so I mean it really makes a difference
because the the shampoo is not to
drawing but then the conditioner all it
really does is just kind of detangle so
your curls aren't weird and frizzy and
then this holds the curls together and
it's just it's the best I mean it is one
of the best lines I've ever tried so the
thing that kills me is how expensive it
is so you know have I bought this again
yet No
we'll see but I really I mean is the
best curling line I've ever tried but
the other living proof one is their
perfect hair day dry shampoo so what I
use today so my hair is one day dirty
this is the second day and it looks so
greasy to me because I didn't use this I
ran out of this although they just think
you knew what I just posted on Instagram
and I was like yeah I used a macadamia
dry shampoo and it is the worst thing
I've ever used I'm getting rid of it
because it makes your hair so heavy the
I've never experienced anything like it
and it looks like greasy ER than it did
I'm like what it's like that is the
opposite of what I want my dry shampoo
to do this one was great though
do I think it's like the best in the
world I don't know I mean it was really
good but I also liked about t'east ones
those are great and they make your hair
feel a little more lightweight so it's
kind of a tie but I'm excited to have
another one of these because it really
is one of the best ones I've tried to
body this is the Jergens beauty body you
guys let's make it for your skin I said
that really fast
it is literally makeup for your skin I
have a little bit left which is why I'm
showing it and then I'm gonna use the
rest of it but I'll show you it's kind
of like Tintin and this is medium to
deep which I mean that should be light
to medium but that's what it is
and you know it looks it almost looks
like a BB cream doesn't it but when you
rub it in it just beaut
fyz your skin and every time I've ever
worn this especially like in the summer
months you feel so much more confident
because you feel like any little
imperfections like maybe some veining or
like you know when you shave your legs
and you're not moisturizing you have
like those little bumps like that it
just kind of masks those and it smells
like beautiful light perfume yeah it
just has a lovely slight smell a
beautiful look to it I have never tried
anything quite like this and I love it
and it's really in my opinion for a
drugstore lotion expensive for what it
is however it's worth it every time I've
ever bought it I will continue to buy it
it's my favorite it is my favorite I'm
gonna put a little bit so like there's
my shoulder I'm gonna put a little bit
on my shoulders so maybe you can see the
difference I don't know if you will or
not but yeah you probably can't really
see the difference but I love it so I
also have been loving on a similar note
the Vaseline intensive care healing
serum and this is the radiance restorer
with pure cocoa butter I saw this on
clearance recently so I don't know if
they're discontinuing it but this is a
similar effect where it's not as like
color correcting but it's really really
moisturizing just beautiful and almost
makes your skin shimmer so both of these
are gorgeous for that and then the last
thing is this soap &amp;amp; Glory body scrub in
oh it's their sugar crush so it smells
like 7up it's almost gone I mean I'm
done with it
but I'll recycle this it smells amazing
it does an okay job but I like a
grittier body scrub so this had like
kind of a thin but like I tried some
coffee scrubs and I really like those
because they're just a little thicker
and I noticed my skin is a lot softer so
I liked it but it's not my like number
one favorite so hopefully this video was
enjoyable for you to watch I hope that
you'll subscribe and catch more of mine
and I will link
pass empties videos both up there and
down below and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
