snack or coffee or tea or water whatever
and buckle in because this is gonna be a
long haul I've got Sephora but it's been
like a couple trips and by trips I mean
online cyber trips and some other
websites but lot mostly high-end
I'll be honest most of this is high-end
stuff but there are a couple drugstore
ones that I think I'll start with the
drugstore once and test my like home but
I was branching out and dabbling because
there is the support via B sale and I
was like oh my gosh there's so much I
want to try so many new things and so I
had that coupon and I had some gift
cards so I went a little crazy I'm
excited to show you let's get into it
let's start at the drugstore stuff since
I promised I would there's only a couple
things so just spotted this at the
drugstore and I if you've seen my
vlogmas where I was drugstore makeup
shopping I'll link it right up there um
yeah I was shopping in that vlog I was
like oh my gosh I was spotting these
things for the first time never even
seen them on Instagram or online or
anywhere so the first thing was this
L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion and I
know these are bigger out east but it's
basically it has its first of all the
packaging is adorable but you open it
and it's got this little puff which I
haven't used the actual puff yet but
then you open this up and there's the
cushion inside and so really it is like
a sponge but instantly tons of product
comes out and it's really really creamy
and I've used it maybe once or twice I
just got this and it feels really nice
I'm not sure about the staying power
however so I'll have to get back to you
on that and try it with a couple of
primers but again I've only used it like
once but so far I just think it's so
cool and I've never had a product like
this so I was very excited although this
where I bought it it was like 15 dollars
I was like for a drugstore that is
that's not a drugstore price to me like
I feel like it's starting to dabble and
I know this whole haul has a ton of
expensive things but I just feel like
when you're at the drugstore you don't
intend to pay that much for a foundation
but so far you like it obviously try and
find try and use coupons or wait for
sales for something like this I
should've but I was too excited so
Lauria also had this
fallible Pro contour and I got it in the
shade light because this one seemed to
be like the most cool toned for me and
so it's got the contour shade and this
kind of highlighter each shade and then
this kind of interesting shaped brush it
looks like a butterfly but only half of
it is the actual brush they seemed
pretty pigmented
although the blend ability is what I'm
kind of working with right now they're
perfect colors for me though you can't
really see this there it is it's seems
okay but again I've only used it once or
twice this truly is just a haul for
these because they're new new new new so
that was pretty awesome if I can find
them online I'll link them I'm not sure
if they're even gonna be available
online yet but I will look for you guys
let's go ahead and get into all the
Sephora stuff I'm so excited okay I
don't even know where to begin
so okay this first one I have been
wanting for a while I have fallen in
love with Marc Jacobs beauty products or
at least a couple I've tried so there
was a lipstick I have called Oh Miley
that's a bright red lipstick I wear it
tons of Instagram post I wore it when we
were all over France it was the best
read I've ever owned and it stays in
place well I've been wanting a more
everyday color from the Lamarck cream
lipstick line but they're expensive so
I've been waiting and waiting and
finally when the sale came this is in
the shade infamous and it's just this
perfect rosy pink
I mean it's matte but it's not so mad
that make sure lips look really dry they
just look pillow-soft when you wear this
and I love this I love this shade
probably going with me to London we'll
see I haven't packed yet we leave in a
couple days when I'm filming this I'm
probably already there if you're
watching this but I am very very excited
about that speaking of if you do like
vlogs shameless plug I think we really
are in London while you're watching this
I will link Tyler my husband's chino
because we're vlogging on his channel
since his is travel over there so if you
want to catch him sledding you know see
what we're up to over there see what
makeup i'm buying over there cuz i am
sure i will be buying plenty in the UK
okay so the next thing I've been wanting
was this
two-faced hangover RX primer I realized
silicone primers don't work great with
my skin some of them do but for the most
part they just it doesn't mesh well this
one silicone free so I really wanted to
try it
I've used it once it's very moisturizing
I'm not sure how well it does at like
holding on to the foundation all day but
again I've only used it once but I love
the way it smells I love that it's a
pump and I love that it's silicone free
and it really did make my skin it kind
of got rid of some redness I had going
on when I first put it on so that
impressed me a lot so I'm excited to
play with this some more the next thing
is another Marc Jacobs one this thing is
humongous I can't do it justice how big
it truly is because even when I saw in
videos and then when I got it first I'm
like it's even bigger than I thought
it's like it's huge but this is there in
some more light filtering contour powder
and it's in the shade Mirage filter so
it's got names for like filters that's
supposed to be similar to so it's got
this really soft contour shade in this
really buttery yellow highlight shade
the yellow I've been using to set my
under eye I use it today and they're
both really matte so if you're wanting
like a glittery highlight this isn't
that's not the point of this highlight
it's a true highlight but there they are
right there you can see they're super
pigmented especially that contour
they're really soft they blend like
butter and they stay on pretty well this
might be what I bring with me because
it's so big but it's so amazing that's
why I'm kind of torn I love it speaking
of contour powders though I bought quite
a few it seems this is a repurchase this
is the Kevin OH Quan sculpting powder
and medium and I'm actually almost done
with my other one so I bought another
one while it was on sale because I'm
like I don't know if there will be
another sale before I run out and I love
mine so of course it's so nice so it's
got the little velvet pouch but this is
a much smaller product which I kind of
like and again it's that very similar
contour shade kind of grayish these are
wonderful they don't move I'm so putting
those this is the Marc Jacobs one this
is the Kevyn Aucoin one they really are
now seeing them side by side different
tones the market Marc Jacobs one is a
little bit more reddish whereas this
one's even more cool tones
have no qualms - I love them both and
they're both really soft and wonderful
but this cabin a qualm one is tried and
true oh my gosh oh I love it
so I also bought the Urban Decay Gwen
Stefani collab Gwen Stefani Gwen Stefani
collab palette that they came out with
and to be honest I had no interest in
this for a while because I saw people
using a loom
but then when I was in Chicago recently
we were at I think Macy's and i saw it
and i swatched them all and I was like I
want it I need it so the palette what
threw me off is that pink blue and lime
green there that well it's at the bottom
but I'm holding it upside down
um they're not colors that I love to
wear and so it threw me off because the
rest was new show and I was like I don't
know that's why I didn't want it but I'm
so glad I got it because frankly I would
have bought it just for those shades
down there so I mean they're the Urban
Decay shadows they're super buttery the
glittery ones are super glittery but
it's got such a great range and I know
people say that about palettes but this
one truly does because I feel like it's
got tons of different colored shimmery
lid shades in here like they've got kind
of a more bronzy one but it's still
light they've got this kind of
traditional champagne one over here
they've got this like yellowish one I
mean they have so many options and it's
right up my alley
and it really is cute packaging like
well probably this might be the cutest
packaging in my opinion of a palette
ever it's just really heavy so I want to
travel with that but I don't know if I
will I'll be honest we'll see another
palette and this one was actually this
I'm mixing it in but this wasn't bought
from Sephora they sent this to me and I
was so excited it's so excited it's the
Too Faced chocolate bon bons palette and
of course it's adorable it's the exact
same kind of packaging as their
chocolate bar palettes same smell as
well and they're so they're these little
like hearts and they're so cute again
I'm really in
trysting color selection but again these
are crazy satin sheets is my favorite
one look at that I mean it's just
ridiculous but I love them all that I
love that smell and I love that it's
pink this time so two-faced makes some
of my favorite shadows ever like ever so
I know that this is one that I'm gonna
love I would assume I've been using it
I've used it maybe three or four times
and I've always liked the looks I've
that I've gotten from it
I need to like take a tea break
xisa leave this mug my brother got me
when he went to New York years years ago
cuz he knew I've loved musicals and
Broadway at the time I mean I still do
but not as much as I did and he brought
this home for me I remember and I was
like oh so sweet my younger brother
who's also an adult but he's still a
baby in my head
next thing splurge this hourglass
ambient lighting powder I have the three
set but I bought that new one the
ambient lighting edit is the six pan and
first of all I sent that back like two
months ago and I still have not gotten
my refund so I need to contact customer
service with Sephora because they're
usually really good about that but I
don't know what happened but I'm like
that is $80 but the reason I bought this
was because I returned that with the
idea that I can save a little money and
get one powder from them that I really
really wanted and possibly smaller to
travel with so I picked luminous light
now this one has that same quality where
you could just dust it everywhere and it
looks beautiful but this one has a
little bit of glitter to it so I really
do typically funnel it just to my
highlight regions and even I'll put it I
put it today down my nose and on the tip
of my nose it's such a beautiful I mean
just luminous powder it's not like crazy
I mean this watch isn't gonna really
show but it's just that perfect balance
I love I really do love these powders I
get why there's such a stink about them
although wet-and-wild is reserved your
Cabana I love as well and it looks just
as beautiful on the skin just saying but
I love them both
I got another highlight and this one I
bought on HauteLook so it was like it
wasn't I was hoping to be like half the
price it was only like
five or six dollars off but I was if I
really want to try that this is in
champagne gold and it's the you know
classic Becca packaging this is so
yellow I saw it when I opened it I was
like that is way more yellow than I
thought I should have looked up more
swatches but while it does swatch truly
yellow it actually kind of blends outs
right over here really beautifully so if
you have an olive skin tone this would
be gorgeous on you because you already
have that kind of yellow shift so it
would already look it would just kind of
blend a little more seamlessly but I've
actually been able to pull it off with
my I've got a yellow skin tone I lean
more warm than I do cool but it it still
works I just I like it I just got it the
other day so I've only used it like once
but I'm gonna keep messing with it and
see though I also bought this laura
mercier secret brightening powder now I
have the Sonia Kashuk brightening powder
and it's really really nice it is the
same product you guys I swear I keep
saying I'm gonna do a dupes another dupe
video soon and these are total dupes
it's just a really finely milled white
powder when you put it either on your
under eye or anywhere you want to
highlight it just brightens it but it
also kind of perfects that area because
it's got that powder that can kind of
fill in those pores so it really is nice
but I don't think it's any better at
least in the little bit of time I played
with it I don't think it's any better
than the Sonia Kashuk one and the Sonia
Kashuk one of course is cheaper I also
splurged on this Christian Christian
Dior creme de Rose lip balm I I gave in
because everybody on YouTube has talked
about it that oh it's the best but it's
so expensive but I splurged on it and
I'm like that's crazy it's just a lip
balm but after years and hearing it I
finally caved as I always end up doing
and I bought it and it's nice I actually
dug my finger in it I'm so mad at myself
but I mean in the end it won't matter
but but you know how shallow we are I'm
like but um I don't know
like it's really nice but I don't think
it was worth the price so I will use it
and love it and use it to the end but
what I ever buys
I don't know unless I realize it's doing
something amazing fry lips that I didn't
know it was probably not because it's
really nice but I don't know I don't
know you're like dying to try it and you
have no good lip balm you found then
maybe try it but it's good anyway so I
also got some skin care stuff and then
I've got a bunch of nail polish stuff so
well okay I'll start with this one this
is the first day beauty face cleanser I
really really like this stuff so I
wanted to buy some more and I also
bought oh well I just filmed about it
the travel sized one as well because I
know I like it and I want to be able to
travel although I'm realizing this is 2
ounces so I could travel with this one
as well
anyway but it's just a really nice
gentle cleanser it works really well it
doesn't break me out in fact I think it
prevents breakouts so I liked it and I
wanted to buy it again the last thing I
bought and I've been wanting this
forever I'm going to open it is this la
vanilla which is the brand healthy
deodorant and I got it in the smell
vanilla coconut and I haven't even
opened this
I have heard oh it smells really nice um
I heard that these are just one of the
few natural deodorants that actually
work so we'll try a few I know they have
a lot of different sense if you have a
favorite scent or a favorite one of
these that you like let me know down
below cuz if I don't like this one that
I might want to try a different scent
because I've heard there are some sense
that are just no good and some that are
great so I'm excited to try this CH I'm
trying to get away from regular
deodorant I keep going back and forth
because you know when the natural
deodorants don't work you're just like
well why am I even putting anything on
that you know so I definitely want to
give this one a try now on to the nail
polish thing so first thing the most
important thing is these OPI the no drip
dry I thought was called fast drying
drops they're called drip dry lacquer
drying drops this is expensive for this
tiny little bottle but I bought one for
my sister-in-law two for Christmas I got
her the bigger one you guys this stuff
works that I was looking at the science
behind and you can Google like what's I
used to say like why these drying drops
actually work but they do and it has to
do with
like I think speeding up the evaporation
of something and but anyway so once you
painted your nails and maybe then you
put your topcoat on let it sit for like
30 seconds to a minute and then you it's
just a little medicine dropper you drop
a drop or two on each nail and I swear
to you after one minute they're
rock-hard it is so amazing
now I will say you don't want after like
two or three minutes go and like open a
can I mean that would be just dumb I
think to be honest but but it's so much
quicker than anything I've ever used so
and I feel like this is so much more of
a worthwhile investment than like the
lights because I've tried some of the
lights and all the ones I've tried they
weren't pretty well but they end up you
have to replace a part you know or
whatever or you have to buy a certain
kind of nail polish with them and I'm
like for me it's just not feasible it's
not something I want to invest in but
this is nice and quick and you know I'm
not a big nail person but I do like
painting my nails from time to time so
it's perfect for if you're similar to me
if you're a big nail junkie then you
might want to get those kinds of systems
but okay this i also bought at the
drugstore this is the revlon colorstay
gel envy nail polish in showtime and
it's just this really pretty like
purplish bluish pinkish color it's
pretty opaque but you do need two coats
cuz the first one I mean I guess it's
not it's just kind of a little under
opaque that's what I would say I will
say it chipped after like two days and I
was like no the first time I tried it I
tried it without a base coat so I want
to try it with a base coat to see if it
tastes a little better but it's such a
pretty color I also bought some more
glitter polishes I'm trying to be
pickier about the polish that I own I've
gotten rid of most of my nail polish but
they're I don't know like I want to have
like if I'm gonna have two different
glitters I want to have a really good
brand of those glitters that'll last me
a little while so I know Deborah
Lippmann makes really nice glitter
polishes so I finally invested in some
of these and these that I actually
bought on the Birchbox website this
one's in ruby red slippers and it's just
this gorgeous red glitter and of course
I love The Wizard of Oz was the first
little play I was ever in and it's just
so beautiful and then I also got glitter
and
which that song is from Candide I think
but it's just this gorgeous
gold glitter but it's got all those
different flecks of green and blue and
like rainbow so I thought that was so
gorgeous I haven't tried these yet but
I'm excited too they're very like
holiday and festive I feel like the red
one would be great for Christmas and
this one be awesome for New Year's I'm
so excited
and then I'm also trying out this brain
called Smith and Cole I also bought on
the Birchbox website this is the shade
regret the moon and it's just as
gorgeous like white creamy milky color
and it's really opaque both of these are
really opaque you really only need one
coat but they look better with a second
coat but the pink one you really do only
need one this one I liked it better than
the second coat but it chips so easily
the penguin did not chip very easily at
all probably because it only took one
coat so I'm torn I want to try like one
more color from these but these again
are really expensive so I don't know but
I love the way they look so not like
well the packaging is cute but I mean I
love the way the colors looked so I'm
just kind of torn
I might dabble a little more into that
brand we'll see so those are all of the
things I've gotten at least that's most
of the things I've gotten recently I
feel like I keep finding random things
here and there for the past month that
I'm like oh yeah I've been shown that so
but um definitely follow me on Instagram
I upload pictures every once in a while
love's like the makeup I'm wearing
throughout the day or random little
hauls and I certainly in my vlogmas
videos talk about when I'm makeup
shopping I'll show you what I'm buying
there too so if you will I hope you'll
subscribe and join our little family
here and I'll catch you guys in my next
video
