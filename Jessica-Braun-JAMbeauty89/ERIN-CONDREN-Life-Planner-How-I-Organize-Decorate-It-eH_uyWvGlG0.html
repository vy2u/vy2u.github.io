have my much-awaited Erin Condren
planner video and so in this video I am
going to go through exactly how I
organize my planner day-to-day and also
all the supplies that I use to do so all
of the supplies I use are really really
inexpensive compared to a lot of ones
that are out there so I'm really excited
to show this to you guys so certainly
stay tuned but before we do I want to
tell you guys about what the updates
will be because this planner is
launching like today the new one for
2014 2015 it's launching June 12th so
depending on when you're watching us
today or yesterday tomorrow or whatever
but I wanted to coincide this video with
that to help you guys out because I
didn't want to do it too early because
it you can't buy it right now like there
was like a month or month and a half
period where you couldn't buy a life
planner at all whether it was the old
one I got it just in time we're right
before they stopped selling it so it
only covers from April this year to
December which I got it on clearance and
then there's a tenner off coupon code
which I have below by the way the link
below is for $10 off which is what I use
to to get this for a lot cheaper so the
so it's on Thursday June 12th and they
have the 12-month version which is
literally just from January of next year
to December so that one's $50 and while
that sound might sound like a lot for a
planner I think once you see what this
planner offers you'll see ok I get it
like it's really well made it doesn't
get torn up and it's organized it's so
smart the way this planner was created
is just so genius it's not too much but
it's not too general you're going to see
what I mean
so the 12-month version is January
through December and it's $50 for only
$5 more it's 18 months which would be
July of this year so by the time you
order it takes about a week or two weeks
to get to you because they personalize
it and make it once you order it
it'll take it'll probably be July once
you get it so it'll be perfectly just in
time
July all the way through December
next year anyway so the new changes are
mostly to do with add-ons and those are
the things I'll show you in this video
what comes with the planner which a lot
comes with just the cost of the planner
you know you get to personalize with
your name that's included in the cost I
mean so many things come with it but
there are also a ton of add-ons that she
has on her site now some of them are
only like $2 or $3 but it kind of adds
up and then some are a little more
expensive so some of the new changes
that I don't have in this one that are
in the new one coming out are that the
cover that comes on this is
interchangeable so you could get more
than one of course that cost more but
you get a different pattern and switch
it out you know if you want to you can
get pictures on these I mean there's all
kinds of things you can do personal
things also the ruler that comes inside
that snaps into the coil will be clear
so you can see through it and I'll show
you later in the video why that is a
fantastic change because the ruler they
have now drives me nuts another thing
they'll have these coil Clips that clip
in your coil that you can move from page
to page and kind of do what you want
with it's just an added way to make it
just that more personalized another
thing they'll have is the birthday and
anniversary pages that are in here that
you fill out for each month will be
removable so I can write all the
birthdays of all my nieces and nephews
and family and friends once and then I
can put it in my new plan or each year
instead of having to rewrite it every
single time and I'll show you that in
the video as well another change is that
label sheets which are the stickers that
come with your planner that you can put
wherever you want are repositionable
that means when you pull it off it's not
going to rip your page up which is kind
of how they are now so I'm really
careful to make sure that what if I'm
putting a sticker down it's down for
good because if I if you rip it up and
almost rips a hole in the page so now
they're repositionable now Avery the
brand Avery sells tons of repositionable
stickers so you know you don't have to
go that route but it's nice that that is
a change they made another thing is that
the elastic bands that come on these
which I will also show you the ones I
have in the video the which usually come
in packs of like three for a couple
bucks they'll have new colors which is
nice and then also though have designers
sticker sheets which I guess they're
saying are like kind of like washi tape
they basically have sheets of these
add herbs that you can cut to whatever
size you want and you can use it like
washi tape sounds like more work than it
be worth to me when washi tape like the
ones I'll show you in the video where I
get them they're like $1 for a whole
roll so it just seems like more work but
I'm sure it's just you know her way of
making sure that you know you it can be
a one-stop shop you can go on the site
and just order everything you could
possibly need for your planner just in
one fell swoop so those are all awesome
changes clear this is a company that
listens to what the consumers want
because all of these changes are things
that either I've thought even in just
the month and a half I've had it like
man this rule is driving me nuts I wish
it was clear or you know all kinds of
things like that it's just really really
cool the changes they made so if you
would like to know how I organize it in
the supplies I use stay tuned so this is
my Erin Condren life planner you can
choose any pattern you want they have
tons to choose from and they have more
like expensive ones and they have
cheaper ones this was just like one of
the basic ones but I loved it it was the
one I like the most so that's just the
one I want and they're covered in this
really really thick durable plastic here
that I mean it's not going to bend it's
not going to fray or anything like that
it's so durable the coil here again
really thick I've heard that they
improve upon it every single year this
is the first year I've ever had one but
I've watched past videos where these
weren't quite as sturdy so they've
improved upon both of these so then that
way if you've got a 12 month or an 18
month one I mean that's over a year of
use you want it to stand up and you know
be really nice the whole time so I love
that about it obviously you can
personalize it there's a million
different things you could put here I've
seen some people say you know the Murphy
family like if I were married with kids
or some people if you're just using it
for planning like maybe for your blog or
for you know maybe you're trying to eat
healthier and you're doing a fitness
thing you know you there's a million
things you could use it for so I just
did my name cuz it's kind of my
all-around planner for everything really
one of the extra add-ons that you can
get are these little kind of holders
they're elastic and they usually come in
sets of three and they're only I want to
say they're around five dollars maybe
even less and so this is the set I guy I
used the silver most of all just to hold
the entire thing closed when I throw it
in my back so
I would have it like this this is a pen
holder actually it should probably be a
little lower huh anyway but this can
hold your pen I also have a pen holder
that was a couple dollars there in the
back as well but either way then you can
use other ones inside so you could have
a few on at the same time if I were
trying to save it to this page as well I
might have one here to hold it that way
no matter what I can open right to it so
there's a million ways to use these
elastics I really like them I usually
only use one at a time but I mean really
you could get really organized with
these suckers so I love those so when
you open it up of course you can put
your info there I just haven't yet got
that same pattern and then it's on the
go life planner throughout the entire
thing they have really cute patterns and
really nice inspirational sweet quotes
that you'll find which I just think is a
really nice touch
in the old version which this one is
they have the birthdays and
anniversaries that you can write in you
know special dates and in the new
version they have this so that it's
removable so that you can snap it into
your life planner every single year that
way you're not having to rewrite these
same dates every single time you know
which i think is really cool so I'm
excited to get the new version
eventually and then not have to write
them every single time then they have
your year actually I think this is 18
months at a glance which is nice I don't
find myself using it often but another
cute quote now I bought mine about a
month and a half ago and so it was
deeply discounted and it only ran from
like April to the end of the year which
is perfect right now and it was cheaper
so I was like heck yeah each month has a
month at a glance of course and you can
tell I really don't use the month one
very often I have these clips that I
bought at Office Max or Office Depot one
of those places that it's a good amount
of them and they're paper clips but they
have little tabs so they stick out like
they do here which I just love and I
find myself using these more than the
bookmark that comes with it the bookmark
that comes with it is one that's
detachable and the only downside is when
you have it in your week at a glance
view you can't see through it but in the
new version that's coming out right now
it is see-through so that is going to be
something to really look forward to for
me because I find myself just taking it
out because I don't like so the month
ethically it's going back to that I
usually decorate it a little bit like
for example I've got some washi tape
here in here
I buy my washi tape I found it at the
Dollar Tree of course you can get at any
craft store target cells like the Scotch
brand and of course I bought packs of
stickers which I also got in those same
places Dollar Tree sells great ones and
so does Michaels there's still even at
Michaels or any store like that there's
still only like a dollar or two for a
ton of them so I always decorated a
little bit but I really don't use the
month one I really use the week at a
glance so this is what the week at a
glance looks like again i decorate it a
little bit with some washi tape or this
is a little princess sticker I got down
here I certainly use and utilize the
stickers that come with the planner they
look like this and they're just sheets
of stickers and these are actually extra
ones I bought for a couple dollars you
can buy I mean there's a ton of add-ons
and things like that and they really do
add up after a while but each thing
separately isn't too bad so in the
actual planner it comes with its own
back in the back they have two of those
sheets the two colored ones and they
also have ones that say birthday on all
of those these have a few other
important dates you might want and this
comes with it too at no extra charge got
you know game day off different
appointments concerts vacation party
mani-pedi etc so all kinds of different
options and I love that that just comes
with it I think that's really nice so
going back to the week view I use those
stickers like I said I think if I were
starting now since I've only been doing
this for four months I'm still kind of
getting my feet wet and trying different
things I think I'm going to start if I
am doing the same activity each day like
for example teaching on these two days
I'm going to start doing the same color
that way I can really clearly see okay
that is teaching all of those days
because I used all green or orange
whatever so I think that is one thing
I'm going to start doing from here on
out but back you know this was about
what a month ago this was in May I
wasn't doing that yet so I decorate a
little bit I use those stickers and I
use different color pens just because
it's fun I don't know the way I am but
here on the side they have a weekly
goals and notes section and I love this
on Monday morning or maybe even Sunday
I'll sit down and I'll kind of make a
short list of what I want to get done
this week so for example if I knew a
birthday was coming up I would try and
get the birthday gift that week or
you know there were quite a few things I
was trying to get done that week and
it's just great and I've started to like
in later weeks you'll see I've started
to do checkboxes that way I actually can
check it off which I really really like
but so that is one thing I definitely
utilize another thing I really like is
this area down here now down below she
suggests it could be meal plans exercise
daily dues thoughts inspiration things
like that I have started to use it for
bills that are due or maybe like a
payday like I've been using these green
garage sale stickers to indicate it's a
payday for me I've been using these
yellow ones for bills that are due and I
just love that they're both bright I
know if it's green I know it's a payday
I know if it's yellow it's a a bill
that's due so it's really obvious to me
what it is and I've also been using
these little sparkly stickers to
indicate when I exercised or ran so I've
started to put it down here in weeks
before I was kind of putting them when I
did it throughout the day so for example
I did my running on these days at night
so I just put it there but I think I am
going to start always putting them down
below just to keep it cleaner up in the
morning day and night section so which I
have not mentioned each week is set up
with that morning day and night split
which I love because it's not so rigid
like some planners that have the you
know 6 a.m. 7 a.m. 8 a.m. you know
that's for me too rigid because most
things I might not know the exact hour
whereas with this I usually have a good
idea of you know if it's generally going
to be in the morning the daytime or the
nighttime I think it's the perfect way
to split it up without being too rigid
but also not being too open and kind of
general it's for me it is absolutely
perfect so I love that again i decorate
some more put some little owl stickers
there another thing I like to use are
little post-it I like to get the ones
that are like the full adhesive on the
back of course there's still a little
tab that sticks up but I find that I
don't get caught on it all the time and
it rips off or falls off they just stick
a little bit better I like to use these
for when I'm doing it to-do list just
for the day so actually this is my to-do
list today so once I'm done and that's
today I'm filming my Erin Condren video
once I'm done with that I you know I
don't it doesn't really matter where I
put it but I put it somewhere I'll see
it and then when I get done it's not
necessarily it's not necessarily a goal
for the week so I don't necessarily want
to write it all down here
I just write it here because it's kind
of a daily to-do list so I love using
those and I always have those with me so
I can make it quick to do lists without
making it permanent cuz it's not you
know it's simple stuff like vacuuming
and things like that so that is another
great way to do that it's look at my
little Donald Duck sticker and cute
anyway so this is a great way to utilize
that I love my clips those are wonderful
so as you go through you see the months
are lined up here of course and as you
get back farther you hit the notes
section in the notes section these are
most of them are completely plinth plain
except for they might have a little
design I added some washi tape and a
little sticker and then decorated that
this is kind of my master list for
YouTube so anytime I'm like okay for
sure I'm going to do that I add it to
this list so things like that I love and
I left a few pages behind it so I could
have room to grow I've got my wish list
so I split it into just kind of things
that I want and then like make up items
I just started this so I really haven't
probably a good thing that I don't have
a lot of my wish list again I decorated
it with washi tape and a sticker and
then my bills did some washi tape and a
sticker I haven't written them in yet
but I'm going to have them laid out you
know what day of the month is this bill
always do the 12th the 15th you know
that way I can always check back and see
when everything is due just in case it's
kind of my master list which I really
like so they have tons of these pages
this is what they look like just plain
and then as you go farther back into the
notes they give you a ton of room and
these have a little bit more decoration
but they're plain which again I love and
they just have tons I mean it's
wonderful how much room they give you
because I feel like some planners there
just isn't and then that way you know if
you've got your planner with you always
have room to make a list or whatever you
want so this of course is you know your
important numbers and contacts things
like that and there we're back in the
sticker section that I already showed
you guys and these like I said come free
with it which is wonderful and then here
is a folder I love they call it the keep
it together folder and I have some extra
stickers that I actually bought from
Erin Condren just because I knew I would
use so I bought a few extra packs
because I'm flying through them and
again they're really not that expensive
and then I also bought personalized once
these I already showed
but these are the ones I'm using for my
bills I personalize them I think it was
maybe a dollar two more but it's just
nice so I wrote I made sure they're a
bright yellow all of them and then I had
them say do and I could write whatever
the bill was so this is one I also
personalized with a bunch of holidays
and I tried to pick colors that I
thought would go well with them you know
we also have we go to Disneyworld all
the time so I made a bunch of
Disneyworld ones and flight number ones
Romi travel there's so much you can do
with these and I love that you can
personalize them so much and choose your
color and choose what you want to each
one to say and I made two of each that
way I could use this exact same sheet
for the next year of the holidays that
way I only had to do it once maybe every
two years so I was pretty proud about
idea I thought that was pretty smart but
I keep all of those extras in this
folder and I also keep these are the
stickers I got for like a dollar at a
craft store for my when I keep track of
how much I've run you saw those in there
real small but they're perfect and they
fit right in there and then these are
ones I got at the dollar store that are
just garage sale stickers but I use the
green ones for when it's a payday like I
told you and then I haven't found a use
for the pink and yellow but I might
start using them for when I'm going to
film and when I'm going to edit videos
are uploaded be great to use but you can
find you know you don't have to buy
extra stickers from Erin Condren you can
find so many I mean like I said these
garage stickers I have a huge pack for a
dollar I'm never going to run out of
them so there's a million different
things you could just use washi tape and
write on those you know and cut them
small you can cut post-it notes small I
mean you could just write on it you
don't have to use stickers I just like
them but I love that there's a folder to
hold things together
everyone's will all have some papers
that I just fold or you can keep
receipts in here then it comes with this
little gem which is just a and again
this all comes with it with the cost of
the planner a bag to hold stuff that
seals shut I just keep three different
pens got like a marker pen and then two
different other kinds some of those
post-its I told you about and then some
extras of those clips I showed you so I
don't like to keep too much in here
because it makes the planner really
really fat really quickly so then back
here this just shows 2015 and 2016 which
I thought it's pretty cool
this was just like two or three dollars
and it adheres to the back and you could
stick it to anything I just chose to put
here and it's a pen holder and it says
Erin Condren but again I like that she
was she had the foresight to make it
see-through so you could still see the
day
behind if you need it too so that's what
comes with it although that was an extra
now I want to show you some of the extra
supplies that I've bought at different
stores that I think you would like as
well and most of them are really really
inexpensive so I for right now just keep
all of my supplies in this like Dollar
General
or maybe the target dollar section just
a little plastic thing you know you
could use art boxes I might eventually
get a bigger box to hold these things in
that has a lid but for right now I'm
kind of looking at like photo boxes I
think those would be great for these
because I don't have a ton of supplies
but it's kind of getting to be a lot so
these are my post-it notes that I got in
a pack that are the full that are the
full adhesive backs which I just love
and they come in these colors and like I
have my other pink one in my actual
planner these are just great to have you
can cut them to be different sizes if
you really wanted to as well but they're
just perfect and of course you can get
those post-it note flags as well which
are really good I also have tons of
washi tape now most of these were from
the Dollar Tree and they're a little bit
thicker they're still not thick but the
beauty of washi tape is you can re stick
them a million times and they're still
sticky but they don't rip your page up
if you have to lift it so I love that
about them they're always just so cute
you have to find the right kinds of
things to use to write on them so
usually for me it's got to be a really
good ink pen I've heard lepen pens are
really good I don't own any of those yet
but I'll show you what I do use these
are actual Scotch brand washi tape which
are a little more expensive and they're
a little more almost see-through but
they're nice I got these on clearance
actually I got these on clearance
actually at Target of course item these
are more decorative ones and this one is
to that I got on sale at a craft store
now actually I use thee this these star
ones on my graduation cap when I
decorated it so then of course I keep
just some scissors from Ikea a whiteout
thing I'm a sucker for this and I bought
cheaper versions and it never works even
this one messes up all the time but this
is the best because you don't have to
wait for drying time and if you've never
used one of these they're amazing they
changed my life and then I also these
are the garage sale stickers I was
telling you about
I call them garage shell stickers
because that's what we always use them
for but they're literally a dollar
there's a ton there's 315 of them in
here
and they're just perfect for this and I
haven't really seen many people using
these which kind of blows my mind
Avery makes a bunch of white labels too
they're a little more expensive but you
can do those you can get stuff printed
on them using the Avery templates I mean
there's so much you can do these are
just random stickers I have that I threw
in here I don't even know where I got
them so these are the sticker books that
I was telling you about that I got for a
dollar this one in this one I actually
got from the dollar store and this of
course I had to it's Mickey and Minnie
and Donald they're just cute none of
them are really that big though which
kind of made me sad I was hoping for
some bigger ones but I mean it was a
dollar for all these of course I was
going to get them and then the princess
one just has cutesy you know I just
thought that was cute and then this one
I got at Michael's for a dollar and it
just had a ton of owls and things like
that the oh my gosh they had so many
that had adorable owls I know that's big
right now so they're so cute so that was
a really good buy and you can just find
so much at Michael's now these are
actually gift labels that Erin Condren
when you order something where she just
like gives you free stuff
both times I ordered from her I got a
ton of these gift labels are you kidding
me how adorable are these so I got this
with my first pack and then I got this
when I bought some more of those
stickers I showed you so I've got a ton
of these gift labels and they were
completely free and then the last thing
I'll show you this is just an Ipsy bag
from a few months ago that I love and
inside it I just keep all of my pens
that I like to use so these are the BIC
crystal pens and I love these these
write well on washi tape these are the
ones though that are the one point six
millimeters so I don't like the ones the
right then I really like and I bet some
of you know what I mean I really like
pens that write really really fat
so these write really really fat it's
really kind of inky and it smears you to
be careful but I just love them and I
got it in a pack that had like baby blue
and purple and it was awesome and
actually I think they were on clearance
but they still sell them all over the
place I see them but you got to get the
one point six millimeters but these
right well I'm washi tape I also have
the Z grip flight pens I don't really
know anything else about these I got
them in a pack of like four and they
write well on some washi tape and not on
others and you know so I like them
enough and I'm going to use them just
because I bought them but I
don't think there's something you should
go searching for because I don't think
they're great these are the Paper Mate
markers and it's I guess they're called
the flare ones I got it an Apache doe
has like purple pink blue green things
like that you can get huge packs of
these small packs but either way it's a
marker type pen but it doesn't bleed
through paper it does smear a little bit
on washi tape so I wouldn't necessarily
recommend it for all washi tapes but I
just love it for writing on paper so
much and there's so much less expensive
than a lot of the other ones out there
so I really really recommend these I
love them so then of course these I
showed you earlier are those tab things
that I use these were like three or four
dollars for this huge pack of them it
actually comes in this cute plastic case
but I love these because once you put it
on the thing you can push it so that the
clip goes up so that way only that much
is showing or you can have a lot more
showing depending on how much tab you
want sticking out of your thing but I
loved that you could push it up and it
would do that so these are really really
cool to me and I just love using makeup
bags especially the ones if see sends
they're always the perfect size to fit
pens in lengthwise they're just perfect
for it and you know it's a great way to
use them especially you know once you've
got so many makeup bags you don't know
what to do with them this is a great way
to do that that way if I need if I want
to have all my pens I can throw it in my
bag you know if not I've got a few in my
planner with me at all times anyway but
it's just great to keep a lot of things
in here so I hope that video was helpful
