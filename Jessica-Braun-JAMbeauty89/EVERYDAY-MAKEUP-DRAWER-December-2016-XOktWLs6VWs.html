gonna share with you guys my everyday
makeup drawer it has been so long since
I've done one of these videos and I
originally came up with this idea years
ago when I was first starting my channel
and I know there are other youtubers
that now do it that I love and that I
watch so it's so exciting to watch the
idea grow but I haven't done them myself
in a couple of months it's not even
longer so I know a lot of you guys been
asking like what is going on like why
are you doing these so I now have a new
desk and there are two drawers in it so
I'm going to show you what I have in
both of those Shores right now the way
I'm using it is I've got one drawer that
has more new products that are new to me
whether it was sent to me or I bought it
whatever that I'm wanting to try out and
then the other door has a lot of
tried-and-true products that I love or
maybe they're still new but I know I
reach for them all the time so I've just
put them in that drawer I don't know if
that's always how I will organize it
probably not but for right now it's
really working so I'm excited to show
you what's inside let's go ahead and get
into it so this is the left side drawer
and this is full of products for the
most part that are ones that I'm trying
out pretty recently that are still new
to me give or take so on this side we
have that tatcha luminous dewy skin mist
everyone talked so highly about this
I've only used it a couple times it's
very very dewy and luminous so I'm still
deciding the way I've been using it
lately because the first few times I did
it on top of my whole makeup look it was
way too dewy I've been doing this
underneath my makeup look and it looks a
lot better that way you can kind of tone
it down because it's a lot so yeah but
it is really nice I mean it does exactly
what it claims to do this actually was
recently sent to me for Mac which is a
really big deal it's from one of their
new lines it's their strobe cream but
it's in there peach light sample so it's
got kind of a peachy tone to it it's
really cool so I really like that for
the exact same purpose this is the it
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination that I love but it's in a
much deeper tone they sent this to me
recently as well I've been using it just
to kind of like kind of bronze my face
with cuz it's in the shade rich but it
is really nice I love this formula
is the Maybelline master fix I don't
love this stuff
I'm trying it out it's not terrible but
compared to other products I have it's
not 100% awesome because it is that
white translucent so it does kind of
leave a white cast so still working this
one out here I've got the Oprah
highlight I got in one of my recent I
think it might have been a boxy charm or
something
it's the highlighter in Beverly Hills
this one is unbelievable it is so
ridiculously pigmented it's unreal and
honestly you can almost use it just as
its own like peachy type blush I really
like this though and then this I just
got in the mail from soap &amp;amp; Glory it's
their lid stuff and it's a sick shadow
palette I clearly have not used it at
all yet but just looking at the shades
you know it's really pretty colors kind
of more purplish toned but I'm excited
to give that a try cuz they don't really
need to keep that sleeve or whatever
this is something I'm actually wearing
today
it's the NARS duo and it's old is old
however you want to say just really
pretty I have this on the lid and it's
like kind of on the outer corner and I
mix in some other shades from other
stuff but I love this I can't stop using
especially the gold you can tell there's
already a dip in it and I just bought it
like a couple weeks ago love that here
I've got another new product obviously
like I said all these are kind of new to
me
this is from Urban Decay it's their
naked skin actually bought this one it's
in light it's just you know a typical
doe foot applicator concealer but I
really do like it I've been using it a
lot it is light but it does saw a pretty
high coverage so it's nice and then I
also have as I mentioned in my recent
drugstore haul video these Maybelline
Color tattoo chromes I really like it
I've got it in the shade
sorry we're babysitting some other dogs
so we've got beagles howling in the
other room while my husband vacuums this
is bronze sheen beige luster and fool's
gold so these are just really pretty I
really like the deeper colors more than
like the beige one but they're
absolutely gorgeous if you want to see
swatches and stuff I'll link my
drugstore haul video because I do swatch
so these and this which is the color
tattoo concentrated crayon in charcoal
chrome although this one
really quickly swatch for you so really
pretty just charcoal color it's perfect
for you know under the lash line you can
just smoke it out even all over your lid
if you want I really do like these as
well I'm also trying out the jus a
conditioning conditioning lip treatment
I like it it's just like a lip balm and
then this was a sample I got probably
from supports their cover FX custom
cover drops which I've never tried I
don't know what shade this is actually
in I don't think 6b 11 is anything maybe
it is but yeah I haven't tried it yet
I've just had this but I figure this is
the perfect way to give that a try
before actually like buying it this is
amazing this is from rms beauty and it's
their living Luminizer and it's just
this cream product that a lot of
celebrities are using that you know that
serves as a highlight but it's just you
know you kind of dab it on the high
points of your cheek bone and it just
looks amazing it's just so dewy and
pretty and natural I love it this is
actually not new to me I just fit right
there perfectly this is from nups or
nukes I never know how to say it there
creme fraiche de beauté a and it's just
a like a lotion a moisturizer but I
really really like it it's probably
about half on so I've been using it most
of the time when I'm getting ready I
switch between this and my Olay one that
I love that has SPF this is my hourglass
ambient lighting edit you guys know I
love this I mentioned it in my Sephora
gift guide video as well absolutely
beautiful amazing honestly sometimes
I'll just take my brush and and swirl it
through all of it and put it on my
cheeks and it just looks amazing but I
love it and then this is another newer
one to me it's opening this is the you
can tell I've been using it my
fingerprints are all over the place
it's from it cosmetics there's Jin
estate quoi quad it's got a plush there
bye-bye pores like pressed powder a
bronzer and this beautiful highlight I
mean all of these are so gorgeous
they're bronzer though is so bizarre
it's like I don't know it's just it's
just all right like it looks like it'd
be the perfect tone for me but then it
like doesn't show up at all it's the
weirdest
things so I don't I don't know if I love
or hate that bronzer then I have a new
favorite to me this is the iby beauty or
evii beauty little trio of eyeshadows
let's see if as a shade
it's called Three's Company it's funny
Three's Company too but it's just so
beautiful and again these are so
ridiculously pigmented oh my gosh I love
these so much look at that so beautiful
I got this in a subscription box and
especially that gold oh my gosh but all
of these I mean it's such a beautiful
look all together to last few things in
here I showed on my Instagram these are
from Estee edit there's their gritty eye
palette and it's got these beautiful
colors they're all so pigmented oh my
gosh and then this one is supposed to be
like a face and eye palettes they're
glow face and eye palette but I mean I
don't know I haven't used it on my face
yet they're all just so shimmery I've
used some of it on my eye like up here
but I don't know I've definitely got
more use out of the black one here than
the other but that is that joy let's
move onto the next one
so this is my drawer full of things that
I you know some of them are still kind
of new to me but there are ones that I
use like all the time and I'm constantly
reaching for so I just put them in this
drawer
it doesn't really matter because I'm
they're both just successful but these
are the Maybelline Dream Lumi touch
highlighters I've got like one
enlightened one in radiant or
brightening radiant and these are just
amazing I've got my Anastasia brow is a
medium brown I used like for the outer
parts of my eyebrows I've been switching
between the benefit cut brow in number
four and the Anastacio dip brow pomade
and medium brown so I'd kind of use
those interchangeably got the Milani
eyebrow gel I love this okay this
product is amazing so this you guys this
is from Catrice it's there smokey matte
powder liner I've never seen anything
like this so it's a little like almost
really thin sponge tip but it provides
just eyes shadow so it's like a shadow
kind of smokey liner and I don't even
know I think they might have sent this
to me a while ago I use that on my lower
lash line
all that
time it is so amazing it's so perfect I
want to see if they have other colors to
try those out but I also have my
favorite mascara the covergirl super
sizer my new Kat Von D concealer cream
that I love the anasazi eyebrow gel as
well this is I'm just coming trying this
out still the two-phase sketch marker
and charcoal black got the mu a
professional pencil liner I like this
I'm wearing actually in this video this
is the NARS lipstick audacious lipstick
in ruck hell it's just a really pretty
watch this one for you guys
really pretty natural peach tone isn't
that beautiful
oh my gosh it's so pretty so I love that
the formula of course is amazing on that
little pencil sharpener I have my NYX HD
finishing powder in banana I use this
under my eyes today I use it all the
time it really is so perfect cuz it's
not too yellow for my skin tone it's
just right so I love that this is so
perfect for fall I had to put it in the
shore it's the boudoir charm
budhwa charm from the L'Oreal quads I
just think these colors are so pretty
and they really do oh my gosh they're so
gorgeous please see if I can find yeah
they're so beautiful I love these and
this is like the most perfect fall
palette even into winter then I have
something I'm trying to use up this is
my Mac painterly paint-pot oh it's
almost used up it's getting pretty far
down there I'm sure you can't really
tell but love these and I'm so weird I
like the smell of these they kind of
smell like I don't know it looks
slightly like vanilla no probably no one
else picks up on that this is my cielo
smudge pot in black
not my favorite gel liner but I'm trying
to use it up because you know there's a
little piece here and then I have my
color plot color pop they say that every
time
livvie pencil inbound it's the most
perfect kind of deeper color I actually
have this on the outside my lips and
this all over so they kind of I blended
them together a little bit and it oh
really
your way they look really pretty there
so that's everything in that little
chunk then I've got a ton of like purses
I'm just primer obsessed right now this
is the Smashbox hydrating photo finish
primer this is the cover FX calming
primer two of my absolute favorite
primers of all time this one is so
hydrating it feels amazing this one like
if you've got redness on your skin or
your skin is just really kind of
stressed out this one is amazing oh my
gosh I love these both so much
of course my Olay micro-sculpting cream
I can't stop talking about it is so so
good as SPF as well so I used that
before I put on my primer every day and
then this one is very different this is
the bye bye pores primer so many people
are talking about this a lot of the
youtubers got this like in a PR package
as did I and oh my gosh like it's so I
mean it's just like a white primer
there's nothing that but it's so poor
perfecting but it's not as thick as a
lot of the other silicone primers I
don't know how to describe it it just I
only put it like all my nose and right
around it and it is amazing my
foundation does not budge this is the
coda Leota bootay I used to have this a
long time ago and I stopped using it
because of some of the ingredients but I
realized you know like for my skin it
didn't bother my skin so they recently
sent it to me and I've been using it and
I actually really like it she's really
refreshing I've been putting this on
kind of like the top chest stuff I'll
spray this on my face before I put on a
primer or anything let it sink in for a
minute or two and then I'll start
putting other stuff on I just really
like it in the morning this is the only
foundation I have in here right now it's
my ELF flawless finish if you've seen
any of my videos you know I love this
stuff it is holy grail amazing stuff oh
my gosh this one's pretty used up this
is the Christian Dior creme de Rose lip
balm it's not worth the money you guys
it's really really nice it's not that
it's not nice but no lip balm is worth
that much money I don't know what I was
thinking so I'm using it up it really is
nice but you can find a million other
things that are just as nice for the way
cheaper this is the Physicians Formula
youthful wear I love this powder
foundation it's totally a dupe for the
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination powder foundation that I
love just like for all over my skin
every single day it's in the
illuminating finish you've got to get
that kind it's amazing this one some I
knew it's the laura mercier matte
radiance baked powder and it's just I
mean it's a highlighter but it's a
little less crazy it's just so beautiful
I don't it's so oh my gosh I just use
this every single day I love it
speaking of Laura Mercier I've got her
puffs down there then I also have this
translucent loose setting powder it's
amazing I've never had a loose setting
powder that was this good I will say
that I've tried a ton this one is the
best nitro and then I also have this
ridiculous splurge this is my Chanel
Soleil Tana Chanel here's the thing
before I bought this I thought a lot of
youtubers had it and talked about it but
they didn't actually use it I use this
everyday I use it today I use it
yesterday and the day before anything
before
yes it's Fleur G and no I didn't like
cream bronzers before this but now that
I've tried this it is better than
anything I've ever used it's I don't
even know how to describe it it just it
blends so well it looks so nice on my
skin tone but you blew my mind I just
used like an elf sibling brush with it
it looks so nice and it stays all day
it's unreal I totally blew my mind and
then the last few things in here here's
this naked ultimate basics palette I've
done a review and swatches of this if
you want to see it really good matte
shadows but in the video you kind of see
like you know if you've got tons of
Palace you don't really need this but if
you don't of anything like this you
might because it really is a great great
palette and then I also just have a
Sephora Z palette with I've got a bunch
of charity shadows makeup geek Mac
shadows just all kind of mixed in here
this I have in my crease today this is
the Mac shadow and soba I really really
like but I love all these this is in my
outer outer corner like the deeper part
of my outer corner it's Mac's shadow and
Brune this is kind of on my inner corner
it's in Nylon I love this shadow here
it's the makeup geek one in latte that
one is so beautiful but these are all
amazing I love them all if you enjoyed
this kind of video and you'd like to see
