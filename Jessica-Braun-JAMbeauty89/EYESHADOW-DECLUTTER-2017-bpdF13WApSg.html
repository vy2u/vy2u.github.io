green shadows loose shadows things like
that and then also like my primers so
we're going to go through this the same
way that I have been doing where I look
at it and say okay what would I go out
and buy again because I love so much so
looking at this little shop here in
front of me one of the things I
absolutely adore is this elf long
lasting luster shadow and soirée it's
just this really pretty
maroon shimmery cream shadow it doesn't
budge when you put it on I love that so
much so definitely keeping that little
guy another one that I would totally buy
again is this pure eye polish in silk
these are a really unique products
because it's got like this kind of mesh
and the actual liquid product is
underneath it but this is the prettiest
kind of like rose gold
that's not even doing it justice I feel
like I need to get like a really but
anyway it's just the most gorgeous
shimmery liquid and then it dries down
again it doesn't budge you can just put
it all over your lid you can even plop
it like in the center of your lid if you
want some really nice shine there but
it's just so pretty
they have a bunch of different colors I
used to own them all but this is the one
I was reaching for so it's the only one
I've kept over the years oh this elf
cream shadow and wine not as I'm wearing
it a lot recently it's just a really
pretty kind of raisiny but a little bit
deeper
color I clearly have a trend I like
these kinds of colors but again I love
just wearing it all over my lid and
blend it into the crease it's so pretty
and these are so inexpensive another
thing I would buy again is this Katrice
smokey matte powder liner it's it's the
weirdest thing it's like this little
stick and you use it just to like get a
little bit of like a soft eyeline and I
love it you can use on your lower lash
line upper it's just a bendable little
sponge brush type thing and it's just so
quick and easy I'll sometimes use only
this if I'm just going for like a softer
kind of like they said smokey look but I
love using my lower lash line
see if there are other colors like dark
brown or maybe other shades because I
really really like this so unique
another one I really like is the Mac
pigment and tan it's just this gorgeous
bronze pigment can use these wet or dry
but it's so gosh it's just so gorgeous
to me it just catches the light so
beautifully now a drugstore dupe for
this and they really are like the exact
same thing is this l'oreal infallible
and amber rush it's just a shame idea so
it's kind of pressed but it's still a
loose pigment and it's just I use the
same figure that doesn't really do
anything let me use a different finger
so there is amber rush and there's the
math one they are virtually the same
they're so beautiful I kind of want to
keep both just for due purposes so I can
you know anytime I might mention the Mac
one I can mention this one so I think I
will keep both but I mean really if
you've got one you don't need the other
but now that I own both I still want to
keep them I love that shape these paint
pots from Mac or like the only math
product that's an old standby that I
continually love and use everyday this
one in painterly is getting really old
but I'm close to using it up you
probably can't tell but I really am so I
want I've been trying to use this up for
what seems like forever you can tell us
getting old when it's separating from
the side it doesn't mean it's
necessarily not usable when it does that
but it definitely means it's getting old
because I've even gotten products like
right off the bat that already look like
that just because the way they were
placed into the container and the way it
dry so that doesn't always indicate that
it's old but it definitely is a classic
sign of it's getting pretty old but this
one I use all over my eye to just kind
of cancel out veining and use like as an
eye primer and the reason I'm training
this one up is because I really do like
soft ocher better for me they both
totally work I have a video of this
versus this and which you should get
depending on your skin tone but this
one's much more for much more newer or
much newer and it's got a lot more of a
yellow tone
me so none of the neither one of them is
like a perfect match but I do think the
yellow one looks a little bit more
natural on me but I really really like
this formula both of them but I'm
definitely gonna keep both but I think
once I'm done with painterly I'm just
going to stick with soft ochre so like
if I ran out both I would just rebuy
soft ochre this one is just it's the
only Mac Paint Pot I have I've used to
have like four or five I got rid of a
bunch
this one's an Indian one and this one's
more just for wearing it on its own it's
just a really pretty kind of bronzy gold
color oh my gosh it is so pretty I
forget how pretty inner alright so let's
start going one-by-one through these and
get rid of some stuff so back here is
this NARS duo I actually recently got in
is old and it's just as gorgeous gold
and bronze color they're both so
pigmented so ridiculously beautiful
definitely keeping that one of the few
duo's I actually I don't really have
many do as your quads that I actually
reach for and use so pretty I've got a
couple of these from Catrice and I don't
I pretty much never wear white shimmer
silver shadows so I think I'm going to
pass on not that it's not pretty and
absolutely pigmented but I just rarely
wear it so I'm going to pass that on
this Catrice liquid metal one hasn't
even been opened so I was just try to
open and I realize I haven't even opened
this I'm going to pass it on I have a
sister that likes darker colors like
this I think she might like it so I'm
gonna pass it all mall it's brand new
just because I've got a million shapes
like this in all of my palettes I don't
really mean it now I will say that
Catrice the glam fusion one that I just
swatch is a really nice formula so if
you see these and you see like colors
you like I would say pick it up because
it was really almost like a thin but
really pigmented formula which is nice
because that means less likely to crease
on your eyes so it's another one I'm
going to pass on it's by mana kadar I
raised the stink about this little guy
it came in a some kind of subscription
box good shadows really they are but I
just was one of those things that you
know I just don't ever reach for these
kinds of things and
on this it actually says now I'm
remembering this is why resisting
it's a bronzer and highlighter I'm like
okay I could maybe get a little
highlighting brush in there I'm not
fitting my bronzer brush in there no
matter what even my smallest one so it
kind of bothers me I'm like you can't
use this I'd rather have a whole pan of
bronzer or a whole pan of highlighters
so use it as eyeshadow if you want but
I'm going to pass it on alright so next
I've got this Kiko Milano shadow it's
their long lasting wet and dry shadow
and 200 it's a really pretty pretty
color I bought a bunch of stuff at Kiko
and I've sent too cluttered so much of
it only because it was their products
that we're kind of hit or miss like some
of them are okay some of them were
really good this one's really really
good it's a really pretty color she's
like I never reached for it and I feel
like it never goes on as strong as this
even when I use it wet I think I might
hold on to it but see that I feel like
the these pigments do just as well as
this does so why keep it you know but I
really like it I think I'm gonna hold on
to it for now we'll see if I don't get
me used out of it in the next month I
think I'll pass it on but it's one of
those I want to put in my everyday
makeup drawer and make myself use it
because I have feeling if I make myself
use it I'm going to really really like
it so this is this benefit cream shadow
in RSVP this is just getting so old it's
like you got to scrape up like a whole
layer to get out of it and that's not
how it should be and it's just not quite
in its original glory it's pretty that's
why I got it but I think it's just time
so I'm going to pass that on or well
really I might just throw it away
sorry benefit and again it was one that
I had bought because someone on YouTube
loved it and it was really pretty but I
never used it and so it went bad that
was a huge waste of money
another one I think I'm going to get rid
of is this flower Beauty one it's just
not very boot what oh my gosh do you
guys see this I just completely fell out
no way I need a snap about this hold on
so I'm in declutter mode currently
trying to finish up my declutter and
look at what happened when I opened this
flower Beauty thing which is fell out
okay so I'm going to go ahead and test
that
bad boy on but just to show you I mean
that's how I dried out it was the thing
that kills me I think this is one that
they sent to me it's it's just a very
light sheen so if you want like a kind
of metallic gloss but I feel like
they're a better product so anyway long
story short this is going it's got the
cutest packaging to flower beauty they
do have some nice things they I'll
actually like their brushes they're a
couple but that is just one that I
wouldn't recommend alright so now I've
got to face the beautiful essay edit
little bad boys this these are they're
metallic shadow cream and powder and
it's one of those things where you open
the bottom and it's the sister of loose
powder and at the top it's the cream the
glue one I've never used I will never
use definitely pass it on it's just not
a color I wear the purple one oops
is pretty but again it says sex with on
top of that it's just kind of a I don't
know it's just not a color I'm ever
going to use I like some purples but I
don't I I usually strategically place
the purple like I don't just have it all
over so in the cream it's like hard to
get working and it's just too deep of a
purple I I just don't like that that's
honestly not great I need a wife that
also for it doesn't remove itself
anymore so this last one is this brown
one and again this up here takes so much
to get it actually out of there and it's
just like a chocolate brown and then
this reminds me in a way of the if you
can put it on top of it I mean it is
pretty isn't that gorgeous I'm just kind
of blending it to see what it looks like
if you blend it outside of it you know
it really does make a difference whether
it's on top of the thing or not I think
it's one of the things that I never ever
use that because it's it's more work to
work with them it's worth does that make
sense
so I think that's it's just going to be
one I pass on because it I never
reaching for it because it's to work
like I've got way more products that can
do the same thing but for way
less time so I'm going to pass it on on
good job Jess see I wanted to keep those
because they're like newer and it's a
you know I know Brandon is exciting but
I'm never using it it's just time to go
all right this was a quo product I
actually really like this shade it's a
great for me just a blending shade and
it's a really good shadow a subscriber
sent that to me and I just really liked
it so I am in keynote same at this Kiko
one I love this shade why I bought a
single with nothing to put it in I've no
idea I mean I can just put it in my Z
palette but it's their single in 204 and
it's just a great camel kind of blending
color and those are hard to find so
keeping that are so move it along um
this is a glitter that came with the
two-faced little set that was with Too
Faced and nikkietutorials it's their
glitter Lee I just don't ever use
glitter honestly so I think I'm going to
pass it on I haven't even opened it
someone else will enjoy it I have two
more of that very first thing I grabbed
the elf eyeshadow I have two more of
those I have a golden it's silver I
think the gold one I'm going to keep
because I really like it it's in
champagne and it's just a result right
out tonight here I'll shut it all the
way so the thing about these is if you
don't shut it all the way kind of like a
color pop shadow I'll kind of dry out
and I feel like that's the case with
this one it's just not quite I mean it
still looks pretty but I think it's not
applying the way it should be applying
the silver one is in celebration and
this one is still healthy but it's just
a little too silver for me like that
it just doesn't look good on me but
these are amazing yes see that gold
bonus right out because this should have
applied as easy as that so I'm going to
pass the gold one on or make them really
I'll probably just throw it away but I
do I want it on my I'm going to add it
to my shopping list because I actually
really do like that it just needs to be
healthy like this little bonus however
this healthy silver one does not look
good on me so I'm also going to get rid
of that one go Jess continuing this is
this
mark single shadow in your toast I've
had another one of these somewhere but
it's so pretty it's like the literally
it is the finest milled I've ever tried
of any single or of any loose pigment it
is so gorgeous so gorgeous
it is so like the packaging is so
unassuming like you look at this and
never guess that it packed so much of a
punch but it is so beautiful so I'm
definitely keeping that - pretty good
with color pop I really don't keep many
because I find that I never use them but
these are my two favorites this one's in
I heart this right here and then this
one's in lovely lovely is a little bit
more gold toned and then I heart this is
a little more silvery almost pinkish -
they're really pretty shadows they're
not like these they're just all blending
together here they're really pretty
though and you can put them on top of
shadow if you want you can put them
under you can wear them alone again you
have to really make sure they're closed
tight but I think I heart this was the
very first one I ever bought and so I'm
going to keep both of these but I've got
rid of pretty much everything else I
used to have blushes I never I just
never used them because the formula is
cool but it can be kind of not useful at
times because it's not very easy to
apply but I really do like this all
right so this max pigment in vanilla I
love it's like the only white kind of a
shining thing I really own that's like a
true start white um almost like a yellow
white I wore it on my wedding day
so it's sentimental I will say if you're
going to buy a Mac pigment buy this size
the smaller one if you can because the
full-size right here is like double the
price if not more and you really will
never ever use it up and less use it
every day for like years you're not
going to use it up so you don't really
need the full size the only downside is
it is a little harder to get stuff out
of here but I usually use smaller
brushes with it or you can dump them out
on something to use this is a single
shadow from what
miles in Brule I love this definitely
keeping it is an amazing just
matte/shadow great for right under the
brow bone great for blending everything
I love it I have two of the Too Faced
shadow insurance I really don't need
both I think all and I like this but I
don't use it every day because I usually
use like the Mac Paint Pots so I think
I'll keep the full-size and pass on the
smaller here I got this
Katrice Prime and fine brightening eye
shadow base I haven't even used this yet
so let's see how bro is Brittney kind of
this white beige color it does brighten
oh wow I mean it's kind of almost kind
of shimmery Sheen to it I don't know if
I want that all over my eye though you
know what I mean
I don't know but it is pretty again I
think I want to put this in my everyday
makeup drawer and make myself use it and
if I don't like it I'll pass it on this
is basically a cream it's a shimmer
eyeshadow primer but it's basically like
a cream eyeshadow because it's very very
metallic I mean it's not really like
this is not something to put all over my
eye I might put all over my lid but it's
so beautiful but it is definitely like
boom in your face oh my gosh that's so
pretty I found this at the dollar store
by the way if you haven't seen my Dollar
Tree hauls you should definitely check
it out I found this for a dollar I have
these two elf little cream shadows multi
bronze and rose gold I mentioned in my
best source of elf video that this one
in rose gold is really pretty but you
can see right through it
and I just don't like it it kind of
blends itself away so I'm going to pass
that one on but the molten bronze one is
really pretty it kind of holds this
color I just like that a lot so I'm
going to keep this one I really like
these but again this lighter one here
this Maybelline Color tattoo I Chrome
this one's in Basel Uster it's really
pretty but again it kind of blends
itself away so it's not that useful to
me so I'm going to pass that one on
these two I really like this green one
I've worn a couple times ten fools go
fool's gold
and let me kind of pull my sleeve up
here it's this gorgeous green with
glitter and I love
because that glitter doesn't end up as
fallout because it's suspended in this
cream so that is why that that's like
one of those ways to get a really nice
like glittery dark shadow without
getting glitter all over your face this
one is in bronze Sheen and I like this
one too
the only thing is these get like kind of
clumpy you can even see it on the brush
and so that kind of annoys me and
they're not I don't know they're okay
these are not like neither one of these
are the best formula ever but if you
apply them well you can really use them
I like that gold one too so I'm going to
keep that so this is my Milani shadow
eyes and almond cream this is getting
pretty old I have to admit I love this
it's a great primer but I've had this
particular one for quite some time so I
think I'm going to pass it on and maybe
buy a new one when I need it next but I
feel like I have enough primers right
now that I don't need this this is still
one of my favorite things like it is
amazing but it's just been pretty old so
I never want to use it like oh it's
really old like it's just trying to buy
a new one so that one's gonna be passed
on this one I really liked but Pinocchio
my dog chewed up the lid and so again I
know that's shallow but I kind of want a
new wish but it's just a really deep
color the color tattoo crayon and
charcoal chrome I love doing this just
on my lower lash line as like a line but
I'm going to pass it on or throw it away
it's going to get dried out you just
shoot it up last night when I was
getting ready for this to clutter and
stuff this is from beauty for real if
their shadow sticks in can I find the
shade it's just one of their cool Oh
midnight marathon and it's you know a
thinner kind of pencil like formula I
just don't oh whoops I was doing that on
top of that it's a really pretty gold
right there but it's nothing I don't
already have so I think I'm gonna pass
it on alright Milani eyeshadow primer
really good totally just as good as the
Too Faced I know some people like it
even more definitely keeping this elf
one I don't like it's their shadow lock
eyelid primer I just don't like any of
their priors that are in this wand
format I don't know why I just don't
like
I don't feel like they work as well this
is the Knicks proof it waterproof primer
I use this in my waterproof makeup test
video where I would put this on all over
and we I put all kinds of drugstore
waterproof makeup on to test it in water
and a lot of its say you'd be surprised
so I'll link that below but this is
pretty good so I will keep it and then
lastly the lorac behind the scenes eye
primer it's brand new I've got plenty of
primer I'm sure this is fantastic but I
don't really need it so I'm going to
pass it on so this is everything I'm
keeping that's what I'm getting rid of I
think I did pretty good
obviously I'm keeping a little more than
I'm getting rid of but that is a pretty
nice ratio that is my kind of added
clutter where I'm really getting rid of
stuff I'm just not using maybe I've it's
either bad or I just don't like it or
it's a bad shade matte formula whatever
I am excited to again get rid of all
that and now I've just got a bunch of
stuff that I really really like so that
is always a great feeling if you like
your clutters and you want to watch more
of them I have my entire playlist from
years of decluttering on my channel if
you're interested or you're in that mood
I will link it below other than that I
hope you subscribe to catch my future
declutter smell see you guys in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
