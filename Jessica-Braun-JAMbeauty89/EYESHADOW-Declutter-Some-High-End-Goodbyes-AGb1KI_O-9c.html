and I've got primers and some cream
shadows things like that so I'm gonna
kind of organize this so you guys can
see everything and then we'll go through
it one by one this is everything I
actually took all of the shadows out of
my I've got two Z palettes and then a
little matte quad I took everything out
of there and organized it in such a way
that I can kind of compare so I've got
my eye primers back here I have cream
type shadows here pigments and loose
shadows here and then single shadows so
I have gotten rid of a lot of these over
the past year kind of on my own just
because it piles up and single shadows I
know I don't use often so I really just
don't keep them but these I want to be
able to honestly I don't know that I
want to have two full Z palettes of
these so we'll see how many I get rid of
but I feel like it's too many and a lot
of them are so similar I did a Mac dupes
video so a lot of these are Mac ones and
then the other half are dupes for them
if you want to actually see the dupes
I'll link the video I'm not going to go
through that right now but what I'm
going to do is kind of swatch them
really quickly and decide which ones I
want to keep in each group and then
that's gonna be that for these so i've
swatched a lot of them I know these I'm
getting rid of some of them just have
hardpan some of them are almost used up
and some of them are just too similar to
others like this is Mac shroom it's just
okay like I wasn't very impressed with
it to be honest these four are Mac ones
I'm keeping this is Brule
that's nylon this is floof which I think
I'm gonna get rid of that one and this
is actually makeup geek this is Rapunzel
and then these four are carroty shadows
to be honest with you as they mentioned
in that video and they don't know I'm
doing this this isn't sponsored they
don't even know I'm mentioning them but
these caridy shadows really aren't
really good so it's kind of crazy I'm
getting rid of how many Mac one shroom
rice paper Naked Lunch not security one
that's makeup geek floof and then I
don't know what brand that is so I'm
getting rid of for Mac ones and keeping
these carroty ones because they really
are amazing like this one is called No
what's the one I really really like this
is Tootsie which i think is a dupe for
rice paper it's so pretty
aunjanue it's a little more pink tones
so these are all just gorgeous so I'm
keeping pretty sure all of those if you
hear a dog my dog is chewing a bone on
the couch next to me here so out of
these here
I'm keeping Coco bear which is makeup
geek they're soft brown which is Mac Mac
texture which is just a little bit
darker than that Mac ho H aux latte
which is also makeup geek and tart which
is Kara tea and I'm getting rid of
Inanna and Panama gold which are two
carroty shadows anyway
I'm actually keeping the Mac versions of
all of these cuz they really are the
same and I figure I'll keep the ones
that I spent a little more money on
sketch Brune and sumptuous olive there
I'm getting rid of the carroty versions
and then these blue ones fetish and deep
truth the caridy one is way better for
that one so I'm gonna keep the carroty
one so I'm getting rid of these three
wedge from Mac it's got a little bit of
hard paint on it umm no name and no name
I don't even know what those are
I'm keeping Omega from mac soba from Mac
I just bought cork Beijing I might not
keep since it's just like Omega I really
don't need both Barcelona Beach from
makeup geek and super freak from Kara D
I'm keeping most of these I really think
the only one I'm gonna get rid of is
sable so this is patina by Mac
Cinderella by makeup geek mythology from
Mac I just bought cosmopolitan from
makeup geek homecoming from makeup geek
trial from Mac and all that glitters
actually all that glitters there's a
little bit of hard pan I'm gonna get rid
of it okay so those are the ones I'm
keeping of those now the Sonia Kashuk
primer is terrible I'm getting rid of it
first
sure these I have these four things here
I love the two-faced one I just bought
this L'Oreal one but I just wasn't very
impressed with it just isn't really
doing much and then these Milani and MUA
ones are great so I'll keep them I think
I'm gonna get rid of those too alright
I'm gonna keep all three Mac Paint Pots
cuz these two I interchange what are you
about your white heel and then Indian
whoa whoa whoa whoa
Indian wood I just bought this color pop
shadow and girly it's just kind of white
and I don't know I just don't love it so
I'm gonna get rid of it this color
tattoo I just bought and I was so
excited about but it's kind of like
dried up like really dried up like and
it's disappointing because I was so
excited to try another one cuz it's been
a while I really want this one I want
like a good one about at the bronze so I
still might repurchase it but just I
don't know how to make sure it's like
brand new I don't know definitely
keeping RSVP from benefit this is one of
my favorite cream shadows it's just this
gorgeous kind of creamy light pink so I
love this RSVP shadow from benefit so
much I'm definitely keeping that I need
to like reorganize here that's what I'm
getting rid of that I haven't gone
through those keeping up okay a little
bit better now
oh and these I'm keeping all right so
I've got this pure I polish in silk it
is incredible it's like this liquid
cream and it actually it looks well
looks kind of like Indian wood it's this
gorgeous color it stays on all day I
love it so much so I'm definitely
keeping that and then these last two
color pop shadows this one's in lovely
and I love this it's like this gorgeous
light gold color and it looks amazing on
top of shadows and then this one's in I
heart this which is like a more silvery
tone of the exact same thing these are
so pretty so I'm definitely keeping
those two
and then these are my little like
pigments and loose things here these
this I just bought max tan pigment and
it is like oh my gosh if you've never
seen its watched it's like the prettiest
you can tell I like this shade color
ever and then I also have Mac vanilla
which is also pretty I've got the
smaller version so I'm keeping those I
think this maersk pigment and your toast
is pretty I don't know I guess it's not
similar at all but I don't know that I
necessarily need that is so pretty
though it's like a light gold color but
I don't know that I necessarily need
that if I've got these two but it kind
of is in between them if you will like
color wise this I just bought it's
called liquid diamond and I used to have
it and I declared it and then I
regretted de-clutter in it but when I
put it on my eyes again the other day I
just don't like how it looks on my eyes
so I'm almost I'm thinking about
returning it because I've literally only
used it like twice now
so I'm gonna get rid of it alright
lastly is all these singles so let's
start here this is a quo single that
someone sent me in well it says they're
back-to-basics eye shadow I think it's
in prim and it's just a really perfect
blending color I actually do like it so
I'm gonna keep that this is a Kiko
shadow and it's kind of like a camel
type color do I have anything like that
in my singles here I don't know that I
do and that makes me feel like maybe I
should keep it I mean this might no
that's not even close yeah I really
don't so I think I will keep it this is
a manuka honey pigment shadow from what
is the brand Mott RTC in Wow
and it's just a really pretty golden
colored shadow so I'm gonna keep that
this is a Kiko Milano one it's so pretty
I've got to remember to use it that's
just the thing
this is the Urban Decay half-baked
shadow I have this in
two of my pallets the naked palettes I
don't really travel with this on its own
ever so I feel like I might get rid of
this just cuz I love it but I already
have it and I have I bought it with the
purpose of traveling with it but I never
do so there's that
this is Stila kitten again a beautiful
shadow but I have it in a palette so I'm
thinking I might just get rid of it um
this one however I just bought clearly
from HauteLook because it was really
cheap I think it was like five dollars
on there it's in rose quartz and it's a
really actually it kind of looks like
that liquid diamond color but look at
this it doesn't really swatch and it
does kind of have that same shade as the
liquid diamond so I think I'm gonna get
rid of this as well luckily I didn't
spend a lot of money on it and that's
maybe that's why it was on HauteLook I
don't know this is the wet-and-wild
single shadow Amberleigh I'm definitely
keeping this it's an amazing matte color
and then this one I just got but I just
know I'm not gonna end up using it it's
a really good purple shadow but I'm just
not gonna use it from the balm I just
don't need it I think I'm gonna get rid
of the ardency in one as well because
it's a really pretty color but I just I
feel like I have this color at a million
things and I just don't need to keep it
same thing I don't think I need all
three of these so I think I'm gonna keep
the Milani and the Too Faced and get rid
of the MUA one good job Jess so over
here is everything I'm getting rid of
and this is the stuff I'm keeping so I'm
getting rid of 3 3 6 9 12 15 18 19
shadows here while nineteen Twenty
twenty one twenty two two three - four -
five - six or seven no 27 so 27 or maybe
28 shadows I'm not counting right and
then three primers I think that's not
too bad I'm keeping certainly a lot more
but I feel like at least it's a little
bit more curated I have a feeling as I
use more of these single shadows that
I'll kind of realize okay these are
really similar I don't need
so I might slowly weed out some more but
I feel like at least this is a lot less
than this where I had a lot of dupes and
I really now that I've done the dupe
video I don't need both and in some
cases the caridy ones are better and in
other cases the Mac ones were better
which is what I talked about in that
video but I feel really good about this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
