share with you guys all of the products
I've used up in the past month or so and
whether I hate them love them it's kind
of in between will I buy it again will I
not etc so let's go and get into it I
always like to start with makeup because
I feel like that's what most of you guys
are into and then all there's so much
else so so much else so much more this
is so much Elsa phrase so there's so
much else I don't know it just sounds
weird alright first thing I finished up
this was the very sad one is my buxom
lip what do they actually call it
full-on lip cream in White Russian this
is a very popular color probably the
most popular buxom product that's out
there in my opinion there's still a
little bit left but honestly I've had
this for quite a while doesn't really
smell bad but I kind of just I looked at
it the other day and I was like you know
I feel like it's time it's a really
pretty just creamy light pink color they
it kind of gives that tingling sensation
just enough where it kind of feels good
but it doesn't feel like scary or like
it's burning and it gives just enough
color that you feel very put together
when you wear it honestly I will
probably buy this again as i'm swatching
it I'm like man this really was good so
I think this is one that I probably
would buy again I'm curious to try some
other colors just to see what else is
out there but honestly this so much is
so pretty it kind of has by the way a
scent that's like vanilla but it almost
has like a hint of like coffee like in
it I'm probably the only one that smells
that but that's just to me what it
smells like I love the smell though
maybe it's more like a vanilla or like a
coffee cake maybe that's what it is it's
product I finish up by continually and
buying these is the Stila stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner they actually
repackaged it a little bit this is like
black with white writing it's now black
with gold writing I just repurchased
this to take with me on my trip you want
to see vlogs by the way of our trip it's
I'll link it below we do them on my
husband's channel anyway um it's
actually now that i'm swatching it there
actually is a decent amount still in it
so maybe i'll pull it back out
well i swear the last time i was using
it though like it wasn't like nothing
was coming out so maybe it just needed
to sit a while so I might not get rid of
this just yet now that i'm swatching it
next thing I finished up I loved
this is the Milani brow shaping clear
Kjell why I love this it could hold your
brows in place but the spoolie is so
it's the perfect size it's like half the
size of a normal spoolie maybe
two-thirds but it's shaped to a point so
you feel like you can really get in your
brows and comb them into place perfectly
sometimes they're just too big or they
don't really come to a point where the
formula like the honest size you want I
love and that's what I'm bringing with
me on my trip but this one I really like
just mostly because the spoolie the
formula was okay but the spoolie was the
bomb so I might like pull that out I
probably won't do that I always say that
I will that I never do but it's a really
good one and honestly it might be the
best one from the drugstore that I've
tried I like the next one but I think I
like this one better
the next thing this one didn't really
run out it dried up this is from the
bomb it's there mr. right now eyeliner
pencil in Jacques J AC it literally like
when I'm first rubbing it like nothing
there it goes so it's kind of like it
needs to get warmed up but every time I
do it it like needs to get warmed up
again I'm like you know I don't really
feel like messing with this there's so
many amazing drugstore eyeliners that
have an even better formula that aren't
dried up like Jordana they're eyeliners
are incredible and they're even cheaper
than the balm and they're so creamy so I
was like I don't even need to waste my
time at this I just was like this next
one I use up is the L'Oreal voluminous
mascara it's their waterproof I bought
this before our crews a couple months
ago and I just didn't like it I love the
L'Oreal voluminous but the waterproof
version I don't love I feel like it it
my lashes are just like straight when I
use it and I never really have that
problem and I don't know it just wasn't
quite the same understandably it is a
different formula for it to be
waterproof and so I just ended up not
using it and now it's just kind of dried
up so that's that I also used up this
product called lip sole or lip so I
don't really know how to say silky
Swedish beeswax lip balm if you watch
Holly eats lipstick here on YouTube she
loves this stuff and that she's the
reason I bought it a long time ago and I
used it up it's like you push the little
B and it like pushes the thing up there
is maybe
little bit more I might try and use that
I kept this in my nightstand I would put
it on before bed cuz it's just easy to
kind of slop right on before you fall
asleep I really do like this a lot
I just love lip balms I'm realizing
that's something that I'm very
passionate about in the weirdest of ways
probably because I use it constantly I
use it more than I do lipstick I use it
more than I do lip gloss so I'm really
big on this and I really was very
impressed this might be the best stick
lip balm I've ever used I typically just
don't end up liking stick lip balms I
like like creamy formulas but this was
actually really good so keep an eye out
for it if you're wanting some kind of
really good lip balm alright moving away
from makeup the first empty I have is
what I use for makeup brushes there's a
tiny bit left I might try and use this
is the dr. Bronner's magic soap and I
have the it's that castile soap is this
the yes this is the unscented baby /
mild formula they have like lavender
they've got a lot of different scents
but this is just the unscented one this
took me forever to go through I swear
I've had it for like two years what is
amazing about it is it's I mean it
literally lists the uses everywhere it's
like if you look up the history of this
company it's really bizarre and cool and
weird all fair trade the ingredients
water coconut oil sass iam hydroxide
olive oil hemp oil jojoba oil citric
acid into soft we're all just too soft
for all I don't actually know how to say
that I'm realizing right now um if you
mix this with water it is amazing at
cleaning your brushes it's gentle enough
but it actually is like it really works
you could probably use it straight up
but for most of it it tells you to
dilute it with water for all different
uses so you can use this to clean your
house so I love this stuff it's so
versatile so this is one I probably
would repurchase this is my favorite
this is the Aveeno skin relief gentle
scent body wash I mentioned this in my
may favorites and flops I love this
stuff I have repurchased it in that
video I hadn't yet but I said I was
gonna I did repurchase it's already in
my shower it's in nourishing coconut and
you got to find that kind it's got this
light amazing coconut smell where you
know sometimes coconut is like boom and
your face like way too strong or way too
fake
this one smells like real and light and
it is my favorite thing for bubble baths
for body wash for everything like that
just love it and I feel like my skin is
softer if you like it looks healthier
body wash is tricky cuz you never know
you know is it my body wash helping my
skin is at my lotion but I feel like
this has been the one constant I've been
using and I do feel like my skin is just
healthier I think it's a little pricey
for I mean it's a drugstore body wash
and it's only twelve ounces and at least
where I bought it it was like six or
seven dollars where you can get like a
way bigger one for that price of like
dove and stuff like that but I'm like
you know what I love it so much
to me it's worth the price so definitely
try it definitely find it if you can
another finished product is from Basin
actually this is representing like four
of these Basin is like lush it's a bath
and body type shop where they sell bath
bombs and bath salts and things like
that but it's in Disney so there's one
called white Basin that's in the Grand
Floridian Resort which is where we're
staying this time but then they also
sell it at Disney Springs formerly known
as Downtown Disney they have a basin
store there which is where we got this
so you can they have like a deal where
you can get like six things of bath
salts to fill um for like a certain
price so the last time we were there
actually it might have been for our
honeymoon so not the last time we were
there a couple trips ago last summer we
bought a bunch of these so the bath
bombs I think we've used all of them up
but also the bath salts they're just
smell amazing they make your the water
feel really soft I still have a couple
more of these left so I don't know if
I'll buy buy more this trip or not we'll
see we'll see all right I also finished
up this macadamia reviving curl cream
now if you know me you know that I
actually have naturally wavy curly ish
hair I actually have done a tutorial of
how I do my hair like that so I'll link
that below if you're curious but I liked
this stuff I don't even know if they
still sell it I bought it on HauteLook
where they have like 50% off of all
kinds of high-end stuff I can link that
below as well but the thing is it's a
site where it's flash-sale so they'll
have like you know macadamia up for like
three days and then it's gone for a
month or two and then it's up for three
days so you really have to keep your
eyes on this site so this I don't know
they still sell it or not but I liked it
it I feel like it kind of held my curls
and waves together while I blow dried it
it's not my favorite I've ever used but
I did really like it but I don't know if
I could buy it again you know this one
is amazing this is by ava NYC their
products smell better than any hair
products I've ever used and it's
consistent I tried like five of their
products and all of them have this
amazing smell it's very sweet I was
actually using it today and I said what
is that it smells amazing like oh it's
actually just this hairspray it's
actually well a texturizing spray but I
used this actually I used it today I
used I finished it and what I do is like
I just blow-dried my hair kind of
straight I didn't really do anything you
can probably tell cuz it's a little
frizzy but I put this all throughout my
hair because it helps this bun kind of
have a little bit more volume than it
typically would and just to stay in
place a little bit better so I love this
it makes my hair smell amazing I
probably will repurchase this but right
now I have like three texturising spray
is I need to use but once those are all
gone if this is on HauteLook again where
I bought it I'll probably get it again
so those were all of the empties I've
used up if you'd like to see some of my
past empties videos I know I did one
last month I think I'll link that video
and also my playlists of empties below
and I hope that you'll subscribe to
catch more of my videos and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
