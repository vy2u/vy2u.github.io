clapped again did you see that video
where I was like it's a drugstore haul
where I realized how often I clap in the
intro and I'm trying to stop doing it
but I can't stop anyway I have an
empties video and if you're new to these
kinds of videos where have you been
these kinds of videos are awesome
because I'm going to share with you guys
products that I've used up completely or
at least some of them they're like
there's like this much left so I'm gonna
finish it up and like the next week but
it's awesome because I've really
developed an opinion on them whether
I've you know when you use the product
all the way to the end you know how you
feel about it and whether or not you
would repurchase it so let's go ahead
and into it some of these things are
trippin cuz I literally took them out of
my shower like minutes ago and I tried
to dry them off you know there's always
water like trapped in the lid that just
surprises you surprise your pants are
soaking wet now that would only happen
to someone that's filming an empties
video so that is a very specific
demographic anyway so one thing I
finished I mean there's like this much
and it looks so gross but it's the serum
a hydrating cleanser this is the only
cleanser I have gone back to again and
again and again and again and I'm sure I
will repurchase it I'm gonna try out a
couple other cleansers but I always go
back to this one because it's
inexpensive and I have found cleansers I
love like there's a polished choice one
I love but it is pricey so I don't
always want to buy it but it's amazing
it's from the resists line if you're
curious I can link it below it's amazing
amazing amazing amazing amazing you're
amazing and if you're curious about my
skincare routine trying to thing in the
most recent video I've done on it and if
you'd like an update a video on it just
give this video a thumbs up I haven't
really thought about in a while but I
love this cleanser what am I talking
about
oh I'll link below are you keeping up
with me right now because I am crazy I
will link below the video where I talk
about my favorite polished choice
products that's what I was trying to say
if I can find it anyway this cleanser is
amazing you can find it at any drugstore
Target anywhere and it's inexpensive for
how much you get and how amazing it is
you know it's not as cheap as buying
like a clean and clear one it's probably
like maybe five dollars more ish but it
is totally worth it if you have dry skin
this knocks it out it's hydrating but
it's a cleanser it's the weirdest thing
it feels almost like it's a weary way
feeling I've never tried a cleanser that
has this same feel to it so if you've
never tried it it is totally worth
trying honestly by the full-size you
will love it you will love it and it's
sensitive on skin so you're not gonna
it's not gonna mess with your skin it's
only gonna do good things for it this is
one that I finished up I actually did
some sponsored Instagram post with
Aveeno a long time ago about these
because I love them so much this whole
line but this one I finish up no Aveeno
doesn't know about this video it's not
sponsored calm down but it's a
nourishing coconut what I love about it
is it really is a light scent I've used
this for bubble baths and it give us the
softest like phoniest bubbles and it
just smells so nice but it's not
overbearing oh my gosh I love this so
much
I'm so sad there might be like one more
use I've had it like upside down in my
shower and now it's not but I think
there's like one more use someone
squeeze it out of it this is the second
one I've had of this that's how much I
loved it one thing that I'm almost done
with there's like this much so I wanted
to show it in this video is the Garnier
whole blend I showed this a million
years ago and I don't member it was a
favorites video I've had it for that
long because I usually have a couple
shampoo and conditioners in my shower
anyone else thumbs up if you have more
than one set of shampoo conditioner
thumbs up if you've got more than two
right now I only have two sets but I've
got so many other products in there it's
ridiculous anyway but I really like this
stuff I'm gonna be honest I like to
smell more than anything I don't think
it's necessarily doing anything amazing
for my hair I used it today and I you
know this is just my natural kind of
weird textured wavy hair I like it but
it's it just smells amazing it's in
honey treasures and it's repairing and
it is very moisturizing I will say
that's very moisturizing when I let my
hair air dry it does I feel like kind of
hold my hair together pretty well
but if you have really oily hair I think
you would hate this stuff so it's
something to just keep in mind if yours
really dry and damaged I think you'd
really like it and the smell is amazing
oh my gosh it's so good one product that
I have literally seen every youtuber
talk about and I watched a sorry I'm in
a chatty mood today so this is gonna be
a very chatty video I watched another
youtuber talk about how just makes me
laugh and I actually really like this
either but I
watch your talk about how a bunch of
different youtubers talked about the
same product on the like within in their
same favorites video and that you know
it had to have been sponsored like a lot
of people thought oh it was sponsored
but they weren't claiming they weren't
saying that it was sponsored and I just
giggle because I'm like honestly they
were probably all sent the same PR
package because they were all really big
youtubers that like talked about it and
so they were probably all sent the same
PR package but they all genuinely really
liked that lipstick or that shade or
whatever it was and so they just happen
to mention their favorite so I just made
me giggle that everyone was like oh what
hat they had to have been paid for that
I'm like first of all you're an idiot if
you're a youtuber and not saying
something to sponsor because you can get
in so much trouble for it a B what would
be the benefit of a youtuber lying about
a sponsorship what what did they gain by
saying it's not sponsored but then it's
actually sponsored there's no what would
be the day I mean I don't get it why
would anyone think there'd be a purpose
in that I don't anyway that is the total
side tangent I could talk about for days
huh it just makes me laugh but I've seen
so many youtubers talk about this and
I'm sure and I know that a lot of
youtubers got this like in a PR mailing
from it cosmetics I get a lot from a lot
of companies I don't try it all I give
away just a ton of stuff that I never
ever bring up on my channel but this
stuff to be honest with you I had and I
was like I don't really want to try it
and then I saw someone on YouTube talked
about them like well maybe I should give
it a try was probably Emily Noel anyway
but um I was probably her talked about
how she liked it and so I'm like maybe I
should try it then I tried it and I'm
like oh my gosh it is amazing and then
you know tons of people liked it too
it's a cleansing balm and that's what I
was like what is that I don't want to
try that it was full it's pretty much
empty I'm IV let's scrape a little bit
more out and then recycle it so good it
smells very like kind of citrusy it's
this balm it's like a creamy waxy balm
and you just get a chunk out and you
just rub it together and rub it all over
and it just completely breaks apart your
makeup and then you splash water all
over and honestly you could just do that
and probably be fine I always use
actually I've been pairing it with this
use my cleanser
right after like while my face is still
wet I just get the cleanser right away
and just do it it is amazing I have had
no breakouts except for this one right
here can you see it kind of looks like
like I feel like it's like a beauty mark
I should just like darken it and be like
it's a beauty mark but anyway it I love
this stuff I have one more kind of put
away that was in another mailing that
I'm like well now I know I want to like
I'm about to pull it right out use it it
really is so good I know it's pricey for
what it is they have there are some more
inexpensive cleansing bumps I want to
say elf has one I'll have to look it up
and if they do I'll put it below I want
to try some more inexpensive see if I
can find a cheaper Duke because this is
really expensive and you're gonna go
through it really really quickly cuz I
do think you need a lot to really get
the job done but it's amazing I don't
like I said I don't like using makeup
wipes because I feel like we're gonna
like rub so hard on my eyes and it's
just not even worth it but this stuff
you really don't when I finished up a
million years ago this is the Rusk
weightless hairspray it was okay some
people swear by this I like that it is a
little bit lighter I don't hate the
hairspray and like if it was like on
clearance for three dollars I'd probably
buy it because that's a really good deal
but I don't think there's anything so
spectacular about it that it's worth
running out and getting and I really
didn't like the smell it was a very
classic hairsprayy smell and I just
don't like it I would recommend any of
the Sebastian hair sprays if you're
trying to like splurge on a bomb hair
spray any of the sebastian ones are
amazing and the Bed Head masterpiece
hairspray has been my favorite forever I
haven't repurchase it in so long but
Ulta had a sale just the other day it
might still be going on for these travel
sized ones of that and they were $3
originally $10 for a travel sized
hairspray $10 who was paying $10 for a
travel sized hairspray that's like three
full-size like Aussie hairspray I can't
even wrap my brain around that right now
who is that rich anyway doesn't matter
but that's an amazing deal I literally
bought three of them because I'm like I
will spend nine dollars on three of the
most amazing hairspray ever so I can
travel with it so then I know I feel
like I always bring like
hairsprays just cuz they were really
cheap but when you travel you want to
look nice like you're in photos you're
videotaping if you're me and you're
vlogging with my husband but anyway huh
knocking everything over anyway um this
stuff is just okay Bed Head masterpiece
is amazing I'll link that below any of
the Sebastien ones are amazing what else
do I like oh my gosh the living proof
all of their stuffs amazing there's so
many amazing hair sprays this one's not
worth the money alright this I have
repurchased this is a shave gel it's the
Aveeno positively smooth shave gel very
simple very inexpensive I just like it
you know I tried all the flavored kinds
that makes it sound like you eat it but
all the scent of times and this one has
like a slight smell like it doesn't even
say but you know kind of that classic of
you know classic kind of oatmeal ecent
that I really like but it's just so
simple and it gets the job done it
moisturizes my legs I have very dry legs
I'm sure most of us do but like I feel
like you know my legs especially this
time of year fall into winter they're
really dry they're kind of itchy and I
really like this stuff this time of year
so I've bought quite a few of these I
have a brand new one on my shower now I
do like it if you're kind of looking for
something new you really haven't felt
you really haven't felt amazing about
any of the ones you've tried you should
try this
I like the EOS kind of a pump but it's
not as foamy as this this one's kind of
in-between it's not super foamy but it
does foam a little but the almost stuff
you run through so fast and it's you
know just that little bit more expensive
than I'm like I don't know I finished up
a Garnier micellar cleansing water this
is not the waterproof kind it's a
regular kind I have another one of these
that I did buy because I did like it I
really can kind of tell a slight
difference between this and the Bioderma
and I don't know ingredients wise I
haven't looked that deep about you know
what the ingredients are if there's a
difference or maybe the amount is
different I do think Bioderma is a
little bit more effective in removing
eye makeup and I haven't tried the
waterproof version but I know the
waterproof version isn't it I don't
remember does that separate where you
have to shake it and then it's not
really truly in my cellar water I don't
know
I know elf now has one out I haven't
tried it yet I wanted to
I'm just curious because elf their
skincare so good and I'm just recently
retrying some and I'm like losing my
mind over them and my skin is clearing
up so well and I'm just loving it I'll
have to if you want to see a video like
maybe on the new elf skincare that's out
there there's a couple products I just
need to get and then I've got tons that
I'm trying and they're just so good
anyway speaking of living proof from
earlier this is their curl okay there's
a hair on it there it's the curl
enhancing styling mousse if you've got
curly ish or even just textured wavy ish
hair this really is nice I will say when
I use this my hair is curlier than this
but I used the Rusk like styling cream
and it's okay it's not my favorite I'm
kind of just trying to use it up cuz it
was a little pricier anyone feel me
don't you hate wasting your money on
things that are like just okay but then
you're like I better use it up me too
anyway this is it really is nice I don't
use mousse often but when I use this I
was like oh my gosh it got me into the
mousse love world that's not a real
place but I really really like this
again it's pricey so I haven't
repurchase it but I'm kind of thinking
as I work my way through some other
haircare products I have this would
probably be number one on my list to
repurchase for when I have my hair like
this um this is the e salon never let go
firm hold hairspray I really like to
this hairspray it's a very strong hold I
did a video with them a while ago and I
really like their products they had a
mousse as well that I've already
finished up and I'm sure just recycled
or gotten rid of um can you recycle
aerosol I should look that up let me
know I don't I feel like you can't but
let me know if I'm wrong or I don't know
but anyway um this stuff is amazing if
you like a really strong hold this holds
your hair it is literally like just done
like I've never had a hairspray so
strong so if you're looking for that
they sell their stuff online it really
is good I'll link it below
I really liked the stuff this is the
Kota levy no source riche and it's their
intense moisture rescue cream they had
sent me this stuff a long time ago with
a bunch this is the only one out of them
that I really that was like a standout I
really really liked it's made from like
wine type ingredients or so they say it
says apply morning and evening to face
the neck either by itself or after your
serum this stuff just felt so nice it's
not really really thick and heavy so if
you don't like that you'd still like it
even though it's like intense moisture
rescue but like I've had dry skin like
forever and ever since I've used this
and I'm using what was the other thing I
mentioned the other video I'm using
anyway I really feel like the this and
the other product camera what it was is
really like making a difference in my
skin it's actually moisturizing now this
is really pricey do I think it's worth
the ridiculous price tag maybe not just
saying because I feel like there are
other products out there that you could
try that are just as good but aren't
super expensive but maybe you have a
gift card to a place where Kota Lee is
sold whatever it really is nice this I'm
just getting rid of because I didn't
like it this is the bamboo beach
leave-in it's their Summer Sun recovery
spray leaving conditioner it's okay
I love a lot of their products but this
is one that it got all clogged up so I
know I can like run it under hot water
and stuff but honestly it's kind of that
point where I'm like I'm not it's not
even worth it it was alright it you know
I would put it in when I would let my
hair air dry and it still looked nice
but it didn't do like it wasn't as
moisturizing as I wanted to be for a
leave-in conditioner so which is kind of
meant I might see if like a sister of
mine wants it or anything I'm not just
gonna throw it away cuz it's so pretty
full just alright but you know if you've
seen some of my recent videos that
leaving conditioner sprays make me crazy
cuz it gets clogged up after two uses
every time and I'm like I have two
mascaras that I used up and I've already
repurchase one of them so this is the
pure fully charged mascara
it's like magnetic it is amazing again
it's expensive and with mascaras and
like something that you have to replace
so often that it's
doesn't seem worth the price point to me
again because there's so many drugstore
mascaras that are amazing which I'll
mention one in a second but it is
incredible so again like if you've got a
gift card out like that's how I always
view it you have a gift card to a place
that sells pure cosmetics the it's just
that classic really volumizing you know
kind of natural bristle brush it's
amazing amazing amazing I almost want to
see if I can get a couple more uses but
I it's it's too old I love this stuff so
much a lot of times you can get samples
of this and that would definitely be
worth it because I feel like samples
lasts as long as the full-size does just
saying it's amazing it makes your lashes
really said the Dominos of all my empty
products just um anyway it's really it's
a great mascara but this is drugstore
mascara I swear by I just repurchased
and I'm so glad to have it again I'm
wearing it today this is the covergirl
super sizer mascara not the one with the
fibers I've tried that one and it was
not the same and not waterproof it's
just got to be the regular and this is
just in very black so I'm you know it is
what it is but it's the weirdest thing
because they've got like bristles to
brush through your lashes and kind of
separate them but then if you turn it
it's just almost like a flat just like
the like the actual applicator here just
extended with no bristles and so you can
just volumize with just a ton of product
it's the weirdest thing I've ever tried
but it is amazing and it works and you
can put a million layers of it on and it
just keeps going and keeps making it
more amazing if I it all the time in the
world I would just keep applying and
they would just look like fake lashes
but I'm wearing it today and I feel like
it's the only mascara that genuinely
curls my lashes really well but it also
volumizes and it's really black and it
doesn't flake until it gets like really
old like this one is it's so amazing if
you haven't tried it it's not gimmicky I
know it seems gimmicky but it actually
works finally the last few products and
you know what I got to be real I forgot
I was even saving these because I've
used probably like twelve other masks
but this is the Tony moly mask and it's
there I'm real a lo mask and it's a
moisturizing mask I am new to the world
of sheet masks and I
really didn't get it cuz I was like you
know like how much good can it do it
just seems like a waste of time like
you're putting it on and it is what it
is but you know how how much could it
actually do for your skin the difference
between when I didn't use any sheet
masks and when I do you know I'll use it
maybe every couple days my skin is like
so much better like ah I can't even
describe it and so if you're kind of
like ambivalent about it or maybe you're
just like totally against it it's worth
trying some find some cheaper one self
has some new ones out there's like the
what are the with the coconut like the
yes to coconuts they have some ones out
I don't really like those only because I
like them
I love the serum but the actual paper
masks of the yes coconut once it's just
really flimsy and it doesn't stay on the
way it should just saying I mean there
is a difference between the cheaper ones
and anyway but these were amazing I've
got a couple of these these are from
skin-food and if this is their green tea
when I have a tomato when I haven't
tried a blueberry one I haven't tried
I'm so excited I've got them cotton like
tonight I'm going to try one of them but
the skin food ones are really really
nice really really high-quality and they
make your skin look and feel amazing oh
my gosh so I love those I would highly
recommend the skin food masks I'll link
those below but the Tony moly ones are
amazing as well and I'm doing a kind of
drugstore gift guide and I've got a set
of Tony moly sheet masks that that would
be an amazing gift if you just gave it
to someone but also would just be
amazing for yourself also you could
split it apart and put it in stockings
or something like that so I've got tons
of other masks I've used but I just I
really did forget I was saving these I
feel like I should because these are so
amazing those are all of my empties this
time around let me know if you like
these videos by giving this one a thumbs
up I hope they'll catch me on all my
social media I've got snapchat where I
post about all different kinds of makeup
and beauty products I'm trying out and
how I feel about them kind of more up to
date really quick reviews and things
like that as well as swatches of course
my Instagram and Facebook and Twitter as
well other than that I hope that you'll
subscribe here on my youtube channel for
more videos and I'll see you guys in my
