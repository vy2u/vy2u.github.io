gonna share with you guys a bunch of
products that I have used up recently I
feel like there's been like now I have
to declutter everything that I have is
something that I love so I'm like
pounding through a bunch of products way
more than I usually do which is really
exciting for me so let's go ahead an get
into it
I love these videos because you can kind
of find out what a person really liked
because they use the whole thing
and so that's why I like doing these
let's start with some things that I
actually bought in Paris during our
honeymoon one of these is this you I
cannot pronounce this I tried Tyler
trying to teach me the petite Mars
Soleil I don't know how to pronounce
that ending part but it's there floor
doral Shay again I can't say it right
and I bet Tyler's giggling in the other
room Abby I tried so hard anyway it's
this body wash that smells unbelievable
it's like oranges but it's like creamy
orange it's the best smell like
literally one of my favorite smells of
all time and the body wash is great it
was just really you know creamy and
lovely but mostly I was all in for the
smell so this is used up and I will be
recycling it but I loved it I think
we're going to London in winter and
we're gonna I know we're going to take a
day trip into Paris so I think well they
might sell this in London
do they sell this in London if so I
might buy another one cuz I love it now
it's like nostalgic for me so another
thing I got there was the Garnier ultra
doux nourishing lotion and it's in the
olive Mazique smell smell or sense and
it smells unbelievable it's like a
really sweet kind of see I don't really
know how to describe this one either but
it's a really sweet smell and I loved it
and it was so moisturizing and I'm so
sad that it's gone I was like like
pounding this stuff out until it was
totally gone it is amazing again another
one I would totally buy again so if you
do live in Europe
get this I recommend it alright one
things I used up from polished choice
this is the resist optimal results
hydrating cleanser this is the second
bottle of this I used and I know I
talked about polished choice a lot but I
really do love their product so I really
trust their products this is it really
nice cleanser but I don't think that
it's any better than this other cleanser
I'm going to talk about which is the
serum very hydrating cleanser which is
also empty I love both of these they're
very very similar products really kind
of gentle to the skin but also strong
enough to truly clean your face so you
know I love them bold I would say even
though I love Paula's Choice save your
money and just get this cuz I'm assuming
yeah you get double the amount of
product and it's way cheaper so really
really love this deer bait now the
hydrating cleanser is really nice
because it's so like it almost feels
like a milky lotion you're putting on
your face while you're watching it I've
never felt the cleanser quite like this
and I really really like it right now
I'm using the
Cetaphil one that I've never tried
actually but I think when I'm done with
that one I might go back to this cuz I
loved it
so that's what I would definitely
recommend this next one is the AVA NYC
freshen-up dry shampoo I had tried this
I think in a sum subscription box and I
liked it okay but when I saw these on
HauteLook I bought like two or three of
the bottles and as I tried it some more
I realized I do not like this stuff it
doesn't truly soak up anything from my
hair and my hair because it can be
naturally curly it's very I don't know
it can get oily really really easily and
so this just was not even close to doing
the trick like it looked like I hadn't
done anything so I wouldn't recommend it
it smells really nice which is why I
initially liked it but I just wouldn't
recommend it and it's
kind of expensive for one of this a
makeup item that I used up is the NYX
skinny mascara and this stuff you if
you've seen my demo and review of I
really liked because it really combs to
your lashes I use it more as like a
primer before I put on my regular
mascara I don't usually use this alone
but I it was definitely a dupe for the
it cosmetics tightline mascara which I
liked but I like this one more because
there's a little more product on the
lawn and I just think for the price this
is exactly what I need it to do it
cosmetics it's so much more expensive so
I really like this definitely will
repurchase it definitely would recommend
it I used some back and I used up a
couple candles I didn't save them all
but I kick I kept this one because I
wanted to talk about it this is the
twisted peppermint candle from last
Christmas at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and I was
in fact this one smells good but I don't
think I like twisted peppermint in a
candle scent because after a while it
kind of made me nauseous but I feel like
you know back of my nerves candles they
used to do the two 4/20 deals and then
it was two for $22 when I but now it's
two for $24 so I'm like it just makes it
it puts a bad taste in my mouth because
they all know we love them and I just
feel like you know yes it's still a
better deal than what their original
prices are but there are some amazing
candles out there that are probably
better for us and that are cheaper so to
me I just feel like I don't want to say
that I'm never gonna buy a bath and
Bodyworks candles again cuz I know I
will but I used to buy these like
religiously and I think I really am
gonna I'm talking so seriously about
candles like it even matters but for
real I love candles and you know I just
I don't think it's right how much
they're jacking up the price when I know
they're not spending any more to make
these suckers so that's just my two
cents on it I'll probably still buy them
when there's crazy good deals from time
to time and there are certain scents
like vanilla bean Noel that's what I'm
burning up there that I love but I would
love to know what your candle
recommendations are below ones that you
think are probably better for you that
are maybe not as expensive but that are
also you know that have a good
Senate throw so let me know below what
you would recommend cuz I don't know all
right another product the Garnier
Fructis extreme control hairspray there
is not any extreme control in this
hairspray I mean come on I was so
disappointed I used the whole thing
because you know I was like well there's
a little bit left but it didn't it's
supposed to be anti humidity no it no I
was so disappointed I'm going back to
the trade to Hair Spray like in the
number 5 where it's like the strongest
hold I think that one does a lot better
of a job than this so when they're
around the same price so I just I wasn't
impressed it certainly is a touchable
hold and if that's what you're going for
then great which most people that is
what they're going for but for them to
market it as extreme number five
strength absolutely not okay so this is
the dr. teals Epsom salt flip soap and
this I really liked it it was a very
full bag and it's pretty inexpensive I
think it was around $5 at Walmart or
wherever and I liked it a lot um it's
Epsom salt is known to be good for your
feet from what I have heard I haven't
done a ton of research on it but and I
remember my mom always used Epsom salt
when she would give herself like just
like a foot bath um I really do like
this stuff and I like it's got some
peppermint essential oil in as well so
has a really nice fragrance but it also
just kind of feels cooling on your feet
so I probably will repurchase this but
I've got a couple bath salt type things
that I'm using but it really was
relaxing if you know you have tired feet
you like to have like foot baths you
love this alright next thing is the
Pacifica Coco pure makeup removing wipes
I actually went through a few of these
and I also had the other kind
I just don't these are okay but the
smells all of the smells for their wipes
make me a little bit sick to my stomach
just because they're so I like fake
fragrance now most fragrances are but
for these they're just so I don't know
if you've ever smelled their wife's
you're gonna know what I mean I don't
those graduates but that's just kind of
how you feel about it they're fine I
used them up mostly just I didn't really
use them on my face because I didn't
like the way they felt they were a
little like almost greasy that the
residue it left behind but I would use
it to wipe off swatches they do okay
would I go out and buy a bunch no I'm
probably will just stick to I feel like
I get a lot of things like this and
makeup subscription boxes it's very rare
that I even go out and buy makeup
removing wipes because I don't use them
in my skincare routine anymore all right
so one thing that's almost used up is
this locks of 10 just hand cream it's
just their original scent just the shea
butter I used to be obsessed with for
the longest time but I'm not I don't
know kind of over and I don't feel like
it's doing a lot for my skin when I put
it on anymore that's just something I've
noticed but one thing I do love the
well-laid-out skin-food I just pulled
this out to show you guys it has a
really strong smell but I actually like
it a lot of people don't but I actually
really like the smell but it's really
almost greasy but I love that feel I'm
putting hand cream on like before bed
and I just want it to soak in throughout
the night this is my favorite I keep
some in my nightstand as well I love it
it's a little pricey beating it smaller
ones to try it out I buy mine on
vitacost
and I know I have a $10 off link below
but um it really is nice okay so another
empty is this chela eyebrow defining gel
I just got another one of these in a
subscription box this month but it's you
know just a really small clear brow gel
and it is clear mine's looking gross and
brown now because I've been using it but
I just use it after I filled in my brows
with the pencil or powder or whatever I
just brushed through and just kind of
shape them how I want them to be shaped
this one doesn't have the most hold in
the world but if you don't want crunchy
brows I like crunchy brows because I
know they're not gonna go anywhere like
I love the Anasazi one but if you don't
like that you would like this because it
still holds them in place just not as
well so that's just something to keep in
mind so I'm Kylie mmm I wouldn't
repurchase it again for myself but I
have another one
I'll probably still use because I did
like it so another product I used up is
the CL Bigelow my favorite night bomb I
lost the cat to it I had this in my car
usually when they're like deals about
the body works for these all it's like
buy two get one free or whatever so I'll
usually do that with just all this
because I love this stuff
the my favorite lip balm which is like
the daytime one I had didn't like it it
kind of dragged my lips I loved the way
it smelled but it really dried my lips
out but this one is so moisturizing I
just wear it day night I mean it doesn't
matter I love it would definitely
recommend it and my last makeup empty is
this essence I heart extreme one mascara
I mean I didn't even say what it was and
I liked this actually a lot it's a huge
one though so if you know you don't like
that you would hate this but it's
probably the biggest one I've ever used
like the size of my eye but it really
does add volume it can tend to clump if
you're not careful but if you brush
through them before you start going and
if you don't let it dry between layers
it's usually fine so that's just
something to keep in mind I liked it a
lot I probably will eventually
repurchase it but I'm going through a
lot of different mascaras right now but
it really is nice and it's really really
inexpensive so those are all of my empty
products for this month I could link my
empties playlist down below if you are
interested in seeing some more of what I
thought of products that I'd used up
completely if you enjoyed please
