haven't done one of these in a while I
feel like so let's go sorry I just don't
I feel weird today like I feel kind of
like sick to my stomach but I don't
think I'm actually sick I just don't
feel good so I'm like I feel like a
space cadet you ever have days like that
luckily it's a Saturday and it's a rainy
day so I'm just like chillin and doing
other things around the house but if
you're gonna have to tell my lips it's
covergirl one of those covergirl
LipPerfection sits in the shade eternal
which is one of my favorite lipsticks in
the world alright so I've got everything
in this little fabric bin it's just been
sitting in my closet and so let's go
ahead an get started the first thing I'm
seeing is one of my favorite dry
shampoos it's the best east one and it's
in the shade or the smell blush it does
leave a white cast if you have darker
hair you know it is I I think they make
these for a brunette no I know they do
and I tried to brunette one it was okay
I don't know I still haven't found I
need for a while I thought I was really
liking this and I think out of all the
dry shampoos I've tried it is my
favorite but it's not like life-changing
I'm still so if you have a dry shampoo
that you absolutely swear by let me know
down below I feel like everyone's always
on the hunt for like the best dry
shampoo ever but Soviet alright next
thing this hair spray this is a vo 5 I
didn't even know Alberto vo if I was
still like making things turns out they
are and this is the Salon series perfect
hold and I bought it because it was
cheap and it sucked I mean I used it up
its you know whatever but not my
favorite you wouldn't buy it again
here's another dry shampoo this was the
Herbal Essence so I think there's a
little bit more in there this is the
Herbal Essence naked dry shampoo and it
was just the trial size I actually it
had kind of an okay smell that was the
one good thing the batiste one has a
nice smell to it this one has an okay
smell it's not terrible and it worked
pretty well I brought it with me to one
of my vacations I might have brought it
to Rhode Island I think that's where I
brought this one anyway
and I liked it it was okay I mean I
wouldn't if it was on sale I might
purchase it and try like a full size of
it but that's the thing dry shampoo you
fly through it so fast
okay one of my Jergens natural glow
empties this I always get the medium to
tan just because it well works better I
mean if you get the light to medium its
adds so little color and these already
it's so gradually you don't notice it
right away anyway but definitely get the
medium to tan got a loofah these I you
know it's like all worn out and you got
to replace these more often I was really
bad about replacing these often enough
because you know they're they're wet and
there's soap stuck in them and you never
get it all out and so bacteria kind of
grows in it so this is my favorite kind
it's from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and they're
usually like you know three ninety five
or whatever you can get them on sale but
there's like the perfect mixture of
light soft and exfoliating but not too
soft and not too hard they're they're
just perfect they're my favorite right
now I'm using one I got like for a
couple bucks at Target and it's just not
the same so I'm definitely gonna go back
and get another one of these but I'm
trying to be better about replacing
those a lot more often than I was this
is the tree huh Shea what do they call
it the shady sugar body scrub and it was
in the Brazilian nut and my friend Sara
got this for me a long time ago that you
can still smell and I kind of rinsed it
out because of course I'm gonna recycle
it but it smells so nutty and wonderful
just and I never smelled anything quite
like this it almost has like a you know
that fake chop that he sent it kind of
has that scent to it to like mixed with
the nuts I love it it's just wonderfully
scrubby and it just feels good and it
took me a while to go through it which
was nice
I might eventually repurchase that
because I really did like that all right
there's a lot of makeup in here well do
some of the makeup this is the benefit
they're real mascara and it was like in
the trial size I could probably get a
few more uses out of it but I don't
really care to it's one of those that's
got like really teensy tiny bristles and
then it's got the little ball on the end
and I just wasn't impressed with it to
be honest I didn't think it was terrible
but it wasn't my favorite I don't think
it's worth the money at least not for my
lashes another thing that I'm going to
talk about but I still have a few more
uses is that
decay 24/7 pencil and this is their
velvet line and it's like the in the
shade black velvet it's just the
blackest thing you'll ever see
it is so mmm it's so good I'm just gonna
be sad when this runs out I don't want
to spend the money but it really is good
another thing that's almost out and I
already repurchase is the Anastasia brow
Wiz and medium brown I just repurchased
it on Birchbox
it's just the perfect like taupey brown
but it doesn't pull red at all I've been
wearing it for the past like four or
five months it's lasted a while I serve
a little bit more but the one thing is
that words rubbed off pretty quickly but
someone recommended to put clear nail
polish on it so I'm gonna try that with
my new one cuz you know I like to take
like photos of these like on my
Instagram for like face of the days like
what makeup I'm wearing each day and
this one's always worn off I'm like mmm
so I might try the clear nail polish
trick and see if that works that would
be awesome if it worked I must just be
getting rid of this one this is the
Rimmel match perfection concealer you
know what but it still got stuff in it I
just didn't love it so I put it in here
but you know what I might it's been in
here for a while I might pull it back
out and try it a few more times because
I'm not ride on't remember putting this
in here to be completely candid but it's
it's a okay concealer the packaging just
gets so dirty because it's a brush and
then you're setting it in here so it
kind of grosses me out but I have it in
the shade 125 fair it's okay it's not
bad but it just wasn't my favorite
anyway all right this I remember putting
in here this is the Revlon nearly naked
it's not completely gone in fact there's
probably but this much but I've had it
for a really long time and it smells
weird now so I was like yeah I'm just
not gonna risk it if I really wanted it
again and I remember actually liking
this for like its own to me it's almost
like the coverage of a BB cream just
really simple you just kind of throw it
on you can use your fingers and it's
nice it just happens to be in packaging
that's more like a foundation but it
really is more like a BB cream to me but
I did like it but it just smells weird
so I'm not gonna put that on my face
alright this toothpaste isn't even empty
look I don't remember putting some of
this stuff in here maybe I did cuz it
was this minor but maybe this was the
toothpaste that I thought was maybe
breaking me out although who knows I'm
good now
and I stopped using so maybe it was on
them oh no I have like 10,000 mascaras
in here so one of them is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara that you guys
know I love it's the trial I might try
that trick you guys told me about where
you put the like I drops or whatever in
what was it a saline solution I'll look
it up but you can also put it like a mug
of hot water I think and that revives I
mean there's a few things and I might
pull this back out and try it because I
am missing it I just love it so I'm
gonna put that to the side actually
those few things I was gonna pull out
I'm gonna put to the side okay um the
Revlon lash potion this was sent to me
from one of you guys and I tried it for
a while and it's it's not dried out yeah
I just I'm just done with it I it wasn't
my favorite I don't know there's nothing
wrong with it yet though maybe I will
try it a few more times to make sure I'm
terrible but there it's not dried out
yet and I feel like I should give it a
few more tries but at least I have a
better idea of how I feel about because
I remembered it it just didn't volumize
and stay curled as long as I want it but
it didn't clump up or anything which was
nice so we'll see this one is definitely
dried out this is the Palladio curls
rule I gave this a lot of love but it's
like flaking all over the place but I
love this one it's awesomely voluminous
it really does hold your curl for a long
time this is the elf eyelid primer it's
just out and it's a dollar I'm probably
not gonna repurchase it because I've got
a lot of eyelid primers that I need to
use through but it's good I think if you
have oily lids it won't really work for
you but if you don't really have
problems with oily eyelids then this
will probably do the trick for you and
full-name dollar this is the clump
crusher that I've had for a while it's
just dry really dried up there's like
nothing on you can see the green coming
through on the brush I don't know if
it'll show up that's how like worn out
it is that's just funny but yeah
good it's nice to have like if you're
trying to reapply your mascara later on
in the day and it's gonna clump you can
use that and it'll kind of brush right
through which is nice this is the Josie
Maran 100% argan oil I bought one that's
glow Naturals that's the brand I guess
but I bought it on vitacost for way
cheaper for a way bigger bottle so and
it literally worked just as well as this
so you're just paying for the name when
it comes to this in my opinion at least
when it came to comparing those to my
skin was reacting the same way both ways
but I used to kind of apply this to my
face like a serum and I haven't done
that in a while but I only use it like
on razor burn if you get razor burn
easily that seemed this seems to just
feel really nice on that so I've been
using that in this way but I've been
using the other brand now and I really
liked it the boy cheaper so I can put
the Vitacost link down below this looks
really gross this was one of my doctor
sponge sponges that you know you get
it's hard
made from cognac or cognac fibers or
konjac I've never done a say it but you
once you get it wet it grows a little
bit and it's you know squishy and you
can use it just to kind of lightly
exfoliate and clean your face but you
have to replace them often and this one
definitely needed to be replaced this is
the oh I like this this was the
Rembrandt Rembrandt deeply white that I
got in my allure summer beauty box and I
actually really liked this a lot I don't
know they don't repurchase it because it
did have it's made with peroxide and it
has that peroxide taste which kind of
grossed me out but other than that it
was pretty good and I feel like my teeth
were whiter course now I'm using
something different anyway okay honest
Agia hmm that this is a Nastasia brow
gel and like the clear brow gel and i
loved it it's real gross now it's got
like brown you know from using it on my
eyebrows a lot but it finally ran out
and right now I'm using a trial size one
I just love this formula it really is
like hairspray for your eyebrows and I
try other ones off and on that but
they're just not as high coverage so
when I know that I don't want my brows
to move at all this is what I use I love
it this is the Josie Maran Argan
cleansing oil
I loved this for a while but the more
I've used it the more I just don't think
it's magical it I have like the
large-sized and I don't think it's bad I
like using this instead of a makeup
cleansing wipe because with the wipes
I'm having to like really like rub my
face especially my eye makeup area or my
eye area but with the cleansing oil I
can just pump some or squirt some on my
hands and just rub it and just use that
to get the makeup off and then you just
rinse it and kind of lathers and it
cleans your face that way so it is good
and out of the cleansing oils I've tried
this was my favorite for sure but it's
just so expensive for what it is I got a
few of these on HauteLook though which
was a way better and I'm just refilling
my bigger bottle cuz it's got a pump on
it so you know this is the SPRO I loved
this this is the style sexy hair spray
clay and this stuff it's like the ideal
texturizing spray because it doesn't
have it has a smell but it's not
terrible like I like my L'Oreal boost
its prey that adds a lot of texture but
it adds almost too much with like the
lightest spray and I hate the smell of
it but I'm still using I still like it
but this one was great and it really
it's like clay it makes your hair more
like a clay like texture it sounds
terrible but you know if you're trying
to do a proper messy bun and you need
some texture to your hair this really
does the trick so this might be
something I end up purchasing in the
future the full size because I really
liked that got a peach poppy hand hand
wash this one does have triclosan in it
is it true that they finally stopped
putting triclosan in their hand washes
because I bought this a while ago like I
was stocking up well a long time ago but
so this one does stop try clothes in it
but is it true that the newer ones don't
I haven't really checked but I'd be
curious because right now I'm using one
that it's like a little Minnie Mouse one
that my mom bought me at Target and it
does not have try clothes in it anyway
okay and then let's is this it yeah
the last thing are some candles this was
vanilla amber it's I guess the brand is
Bella and it's a soy candle that I got
on clearance from Target but they had
like the cute gold lid but these are
really good in the scent
Rowe is kind of amazing for this but I
think they're kind of pricey if they're
not on sale and then this was the snow
day candle from Bath and Body Works it
just smells like fire robot like fire
but I loved these and I bought a few of
these after Christmas on sale and the
other ones that I bought I bought like
vanilla snowflake and I think one other
I'm gonna save those for wintertime now
I was burning this in like the spring
and it just didn't have the right feel
to it I'm like this doesn't feel right I
should be burning like I'm burning
market peach over there right now and
like that is like for right now but snow
day and all those I wish I would have
saved this but I'm saving the other ones
for Christmas so definitely stock up
when they got those Christmas sales and
then just save them and then you got a
bunch for that year anyway so that is
those are all my empties I hope that was
enjoyable and a little bit informative I
know I'm scatterbrained today but anyway
uh I will catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
