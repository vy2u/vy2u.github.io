so many of you guys are so wonderful and
you're just curious about how I'm
planning my wedding and you know a lot
of you guys are either in the midst of
planning your own or you already are
married and you just love doing it so
you just like hearing about it or maybe
you're not engaged you're getting
married at all but you also just I don't
know whatever the reason I figured you
know I guess I could do a few videos I
don't want to stress myself out because
wedding planning is kind of stressful
enough as it is that I didn't want to
add more stress when it comes to the
wedding by doing the whole series of
stuff some like I don't know that much
and about when it clearly this it
doesn't matter anyway so this is just a
really casual video I'm just in casual
clothes and drinking my coffee but I
wanted to tell you guys about how I've
kind of gotten too organized when it
comes to planning my wedding and you
guys know I mean it's no secret that I
love Erin Condren calm if you don't know
what that is well I mean everyone talks
about it here on YouTube and everywhere
it's just they sell it's a website that
sells planners and stationery and just
tons of stuff and for about a year year
and a half now I've been I just get all
kinds of stuff in that site I'm a
teacher so I just like personalize I've
got personalized clipboards and that's
where I got gifts for other other
teachers that I teach with and you know
I just love that site but I've been
using their life planner for about a
year and a half and it's amazing now
they're pricey they're like fifty-five
sixty bucks but I love them and they're
one of those things that they're so well
thought out and useful that to me it's
worth it's worth the price so I can link
the video where I go through how I
organize and decorate my back that
planner down below I'm not going to talk
about that today today I'm gonna talk
about how I'm doing my wedding and they
sell wedding planners and what I
discovered that I about lost my freaking
mind so of course I ordered one and what
is so crazy is that Erin Condren the
media team had reached out to me very
recently because I've driven a lot of
traffic they're just from my youtube
because well I love Erin Condren I mean
I just do so they contacted me for the
first time ever I would say about a
month ago and said hey would you like to
do a giveaway we can send you the
wedding planner because we're here
you're getting married and I was like I
have already bought the wedding planner
and they're like oh well you could at
least do a giveaway I'm like sweet
Oh so let's just show so much I love it
I had already bought the wedding planner
because of course I had so this is the
design I went with it was actually the
design was already there but you could
pick what colors you wanted for each of
the things so I picked like this really
pretty kind of bluish purple and then
this like mint green and it says Tyler
and Jessica there on the bottom I know
it's got a glare and then this is
wedding 2015 so I am gonna go ahead and
show you kind of the inside of this and
how it's laid out it is amazing I
haven't actually written anything in it
yet because I wanted to show it to you
as it is first and then after I show you
the insides I'm gonna show you a few of
my favorite accessories that I got to go
with it that I'm really excited about so
let's go ahead and get into it so this
is the front of it and of course you can
get it to say whatever you want like I
said I picked the colors they also have
the more expensive ones they have have
like foil in them don't mind you guys I
was doing makeup reviews before this so
I've got like makeup and writing oh my
god I'm just a mess so just take your
right hands and this is like a bookmark
that you can put in any of the pages
that you're on so when you first open it
there's you know you can write your
information there there's always cute
quotes all over these that's what's so
cute about their products so then it
starts right into the monthly planning
and this is different than the life
planner and that this only has the
months it does amonth view it doesn't
have the weekly view like a life planner
would because there's there's so much
more at the end so you would just be
writing your monthly things on here and
then any like goals for the month of
January what do you need to get done in
February for your wedding things like
that it does have a page of notes right
after each month which i think is pretty
cool so once you get through the months
and you can decide I think this is a 12
month one I think you can get an
eighteen month one as well you know if
you're planning one from that far out so
once you get past the months there's the
I do list which these are just the top
ten wedding tips it just talks about
getting organized you know take notes
and I mean just all kinds of different
things that like I even love this number
eight attitude of gratitude so much love
effort and money go into creating the
perfect event carry a pack of thank-you
notes in your purse you can quickly
thank those who have made this time in
your life so special so I mean just cute
sweet things to keep in mind
this is one of my favorite parts this
goes through a checklist of what you
should be getting done at certain points
in the planning process so 14 to 9
months before and it says you know
create a budget choose your wedding
party compile a guest list things like
that eight to six months buy your dress
book the band book a photographer things
like that and then six two four four to
one month before and then the week of
the wedding and then does it go any
farther no so it's just these are things
like I went through this and I had
printed off a ton of checklist online
like you know there's tons of this kind
of thing online but there were things on
here that I hadn't even thought of like
um what had I not thought of Oh
rehearsal dinner invitation sounds so
simple that wasn't on any of the
checklist like of course you should do
that but I didn't know when you should
do that and you know little things like
that that I just had not I don't know I
just not thought of so I thought this
it's a very thorough list then it goes
through different things of the wedding
you want planning spaceforce so
bridesmaids you want to write their name
phone number address dress size shoe
size etc groomsmen same idea the guest
list and they provide a few pages for
that and then the budget checklist so
this goes through you know at the
reception the venue and rentals what's
your budget what do you estimate and
what are you what did you spend in the
end and they do that for everything
flowers and decorations music ceremony
stationery wedding rings I mean
everything is so thought-out
then this goes through like a list of
pictures that you might want to make
sure like different shots you want to
get so they provide recommended
important shots like the bride getting
ready shots of the bouquet father seeing
the bride and her gown all of those and
then other ideas you want to add cuz you
know Pinterest is filled with tons of
cute ideas and you know this is
something you would go over with your
photographer and you could just make a
copy of this and send it to him or just
type it up but I love that you can kind
of drop-down your ideas here music ideas
so different music you want and then
down here the specific songs you might
want to think about like the
father-daughter dance the wedding party
intros first dance mother-son dance here
goes through like if you were having you
know maybe an open bar or something at
your wedding the different kind
of alcohol you'd want to have so like
what red wine do you want to have white
wine etc over here this is if you were
you know for catering and for things
like that writing your notes from
tastings like if you went what were some
of your favorite foods that you tried
and things like that rehearsal dinner
reception dinner flowers cake tasting
notes and you says clip photo and ideas
here welcome baskets for the guests
especially if guests we're coming from
out of town and you wanted to have a
welcome basket for him you could write
down maybe what you want to do for that
this is awesome as well the vendor
contact list so it goes through the
different vendors you might have and
you'd write their name address email and
phone and this is something that like
your maid-of-honor someone can carry
around this entire thing with them so
that way at any point in time is
something we're going wrong she would
have all the info she'd ever need in
this planner you know anyone she needed
to get a hold of etc just note pages
ideas sketches and dreams like if you
wanted to maybe sketch like how you're
gonna set up the tables at your
reception like Tyler's and my reception
is in its outside and actually in his
parents backyard and you know we might
want to sketch where do we want the
tables where we gonna put lights etc and
then back here are all kinds of stickers
and what I thought was cool is that
whatever colors I had picked for the
front the purple and the green they use
those colors like that color family to
do these stickers so these are all like
in the purple family and those are on
them green family or blue and it's just
stickers that you might stick on your
monthly thing so caterer like if you're
booking it you'd put it maybe on a
certain day in January
photographer booked the honeymoon bakery
order cake I mean just everything hair
appointment mani-pedi everything and
then some blank ones you could write in
whatever you need it and then a ton of
blank ones and then more note pages and
I want to say that yeah the rest of it
is all note pages and then like
sketching pages which is awesome because
that ends up being really useful for me
it's like constantly having a notepad
with you
then back here as they do in all of
their planners they have like a folder
where you can stick things in receipts
whatever and then they also always have
this really thick nice bag that shuts
that again you can keep receipts in or
anything like that that you might need
that has to do with your wedding I think
would be important
you can keep business cards in there
this is something that if you go to
wedding shows you should bring with you
and anything you collect that you
actually like you can keep in here and
you could take notes and things in this
but what I love about it is that it's so
you can personalize it so much and then
on top of that it's just so amazing I
mean it's very thorough and I feel like
if you have this and you use it to plan
your wedding you are not gonna forget
anything and it's all in one place
you're not you know you don't have half
of it on a computer half of it in a
notebook some of it scrawled on a piece
of a receipt you know it's all in one
place
so clearly this planner is very like I
said it's just so well thought out
they've thought of kind of every little
thing and I feel like it's just such an
amazing just an amazing product to help
you not forget anything whether you're
planning for a wedding in six months or
you're playing for wedding a year or two
years like I feel like this is helpful
and it really lays things out in a way
that's that kind of ensures that you
don't forget anything and so some of my
other favorite accessories that I just
got from there and again these are ones
I purchased on my own this like holder
for your planner and this is the very
first thing that I've ever ordered that
has what my new last name will be which
is bran so it says Jessica bran on it
and of course they're not using it yet
I'm waiting I'm just gonna put it away
until we're actually married but it's
the very first thing it's a very first
time I've ever even seen like my name
like that in print and it's so exciting
oh my gosh
but some other just cool things they
have nothing to do with the wedding they
have this monthly budget book for like I
want to say it's like five or six bucks
and it just goes through like the month
and you can write in like all your
different expenses so you can see how it
really it Divis everything up it even
mentions like income so it's just cool
and they separate it by months you can
kind of track if you're someone that
doesn't really like keeping track of
their budgets online or on computers
like Tyler is really good about doing
finance on computers but I like to write
things down that's why I like planners
that's why because I don't I don't know
I'm just old-fashioned I guess so I
really loved the idea of this and then
another one was this wellness Journal
that's also like five or six bucks on
there and it goes through like you can
keep track of your weight and your BMI
and each week you can write the weekend
and you can write everything that you
ate so I mean it and what activities did
you do that day did you run did you you
know anything like that I just thought
was so cool you know at the start of a
new year of course now it's gosh it's
almost February at the start of a new
year you know everyone's kind of focused
on their health and I thought this is
such a cool way to keep track of that
anyway so those are just some of my
favorites they I have I literally owned
tons of things from them that I use like
I said the clipboards I use at school I
love Erin Condren they were nice enough
to offer a giveaway like I mentioned
earlier and it is for a $100 gift card
to erin Concha calm but the stipulation
is it must be spent on a wedding planner
only so only enter if you are getting
married and you want a wedding planner
I'm not sure how they keep track of that
like how they would know but she was
sure to lay that out so I wanted to
relay that message to you guys so tended
to give away just check below for the
rules it'll be really simple to enter
but please only future brides to be
entered that way it's fair and the
people that genuinely need a wedding
planner can get it I am so excited I
clearly love mine and I'm just so
excited to get married and all that
stuff so let me know what other wedding
things you're interested in seeing if I
were to do a couple more of these videos
I can try I might work them like a few
ideas into one video I'm not sure
exactly how it'll look but I am curious
about what you guys are curious about so
please let me know down below and I will
catch you guys in my next one bye
similar products to these would be like
the Revlon bone sayings that are the
matte balm stains that's a similar
application and the similar packaging
these are a little bit thinner than
those for comparison and one huge
downside is that when I open these the
very first time I open them the thing
fell out and then when i swatched them
they were falling out and they were
falling out as I applied them and that
was true for both of them so that was
fun that's what's so fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
