fourth installment of my what's in my
everyday makeup drawer videos I love
filming these because I love every few
weeks just going through my collection
and redoing this drawer and just kind of
picking out products that I haven't
really been using in a long time or
maybe brand new products that I'm trying
to use it's just so fun these are I
think these are my favorite videos to
make because well they're really easy
but it's also just fun I love going
through a wide collection because
otherwise there's just so many things I
don't use so if you've got a really
large collection and you feel like
there's things you're not using try this
it doesn't have to be a drawer can just
be you know pulling out and using like a
little basket a lot of people will use
or just putting them in a makeup bag
just switch things out if you have a big
collection if you don't have a big
collection well then you don't have this
problem which is really nice but I get a
lot of things sent to me and I like to
review a lot of things so I mean that's
just what happens you know what's the
fallout from that it's a good problem to
have but it's a problem than the last so
wow I talked a lot about nothing anyway
so here we go okay so this is what is in
my everyday makeup drawer right now
we'll just start in the back here for
mascara I'm using the Rimmel scandaleyes
retro glam mascara I have fallen in love
with this stuff
I had no idea I would like it because
frankly I don't usually like Rimmel's
mascaras but this one I just fell in
love with it was sent to me in an
influenster voxbox and it is amazing if
you check on my Instagram I show like
pictures of the brush and kind of like a
video of it so I really really like that
stuff it's a couple options for eyeliner
I'm using up this Jordana easy liner
it's okay it's just not my favorite I
mean so I figure I'll use it up just for
tightlining and then I'll toss it it's
in the realm of Jordana I would much
rather use their other liners they have
that are like the 12-hour ones this is
the Physicians Formula
eye booster one that's a liquid eyeliner
that I love I use it pretty much every
single day my Anastasia clear brow gel I
use every single day my eye makeup
remover pen from ELF and then this is a
pencil from starlooks that is it's the
gem I pencil it's in the shade amethyst
it's just such a drop
such a pretty color for foundation still
using my Revlon Colorstay in 150 buff
this is the normal to dry skin which I
really like right now this time of year
just because well my skin is dry then
speaking of dry skin I'm using the elf
makeup mist inset just because it's got
some minerals in it and by minerals I
mean vitamins and it's inexpensive and
it's just a great way to kind of help
you revive your skin on these dry winter
days I also have my Mac Studio Fix
powder that it's not my favorite but I
do like it so I'm just gonna continue
using it because I haven't used it in a
while I have two different like
highlighting concealers I have the
Maybelline Dream Lumi and the Maybelline
instant age rewind both of them are in
like the brightener shade or radiance I
love both and sometimes I use them
together sometimes separate but I just
love them and I recently repurchase them
because I forgot how much I loved them I
have two different options for lips this
week I have and they're both some of the
what are they called the lacquer balms
is the color burst in what was it called
whimsical and then this one's in demure
which is my favorite everyday but I love
love love both but they do have a little
bit of glitter in them so keep that in
mind but they don't we're we're off
weird so I don't really mind it I really
really like them and they smell like
mint which is always awesome my L'Oreal
24 hour liner in blackest black I use
all the time this is an elf HD under eye
setting powder but it's actually just
their HD powder in the corrective yellow
shade and i depotted whatever was in
this it was like a white with the
glitter it was really weird so and then
I put the yellow in this so it could be
in a smaller container so I am Anastasia
brow powder and medium brown I use every
single day this is my one of my
favorites the Vaseline lip therapy it's
all torn up in cocoa butter I just oh my
gosh my lips feel so moisturized with
that and it's like a dollar ninety-nine
at Target so so cheap and they have like
the cocoa butter they have unscented and
I think they have like a red one which I
want to try next is like cherry or
something like that for blush I'm using
the Tarte exposed blush this blush
exposed when I bought it I didn't like
it and I'm like oh man but I've just
been using it alone with no bronzer or
anything just straight up and it is
gorgeous and it they really do last all
day
but this color I kind of get it because
it's one of those colors you can use
without having to contour anything it's
just so beautiful I have the Smashbox
photo finish primer for primer when I
want it I noticed that when I use
primers I my pores I start having
blackheads and I start because it's just
kind of clogs my pores so I don't use it
that often unless I'm really wanting an
all-day look and then I'm using the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer for my
brother I love that stuff so I have some
new products from Sigma that they just
sent me I recently became a Sigma
affiliate which surprisingly is not that
hard to do I have found out which was
very interesting but that's exciting um
so they sent me a few new products just
to kind of try out because I hadn't
really tried any of their makeup
products I tried a few so well this is a
wet wild shadow that I just love it's in
the shade nutty and these are so
inexpensive and this is such a good
shadow this is the Sigma eyeshadow base
and persuade and it's such a pretty just
neutral color perfect don't mind my
nails they're a mess perfect as a base I
mean goodness me I used it today and I
was like wow it completely completely
mutes out the color of your lids which
is so nice if you have veining or any
discoloration that way when you do put
your shadow on a it'll last all day but
be it's just a blank slate you know so I
really really liked this I was very
excited about that so that was really
often they said that because I'm really
liking it and the link for these will be
below they also sent me this eye shadow
I haven't tried yet it's in the shade I
can't pronounce the name Elysee I don't
know what how do you say I don't know um
it's not it doesn't look like it's a
color I would wear so we'll see well see
this I got a long time ago when I
purchased brushes from them and it's
just like kind of a trial thing you guys
I love these colors especially command
and publicized I use these all the time
you can tell because there's like huge
chunks out of them it doesn't look like
it there really is so I love love love
their shadows for another eyeshadow base
I have the Too Faced shadow insurance
which I'm trying out elfs it's a per my
next pallet that I recently got I'm
going back to my max
often gentle I haven't used in a while
that I live especially the holidays are
right around the corner which I'm so
excited and this is just such a pretty
glow it's in soft and gentle did I say
that I think another product that's an
old favorite my ELF
mineral foundation I have it in
porcelain I have it in two different
shades but I'm very fair right now so
that'll work for me my cuticles are dry
which you can probably tell from this
video cuz you're probably like ah what's
wrong with your cuticles so I've got
this elf apricot like oil cuticle oil
that I just recently started using that
my friend amber sent me that I've been
liking it's just really nice during
again these dry winter months then I
have my two different naked palettes
here on the side they just fit so
perfectly and a lot of people have been
asking if I'm gonna buy the Naked 3
first of all that's fifty two dollars I
don't want to spend second of all I
don't know because honestly they're like
rose-colored and pink shadows or
anything pink shaded just really don't
look good on my eyes at least not to me
so I don't know that I will in plus it's
a lot of money so we'll see we'll see
we'll see I'm also thinking let me know
below if you think I should I'm thinking
about doing a witch Naked palette to buy
like which one's worth it including The
Naked basics or maybe just like a video
about palettes I don't know so let me
know if you'd be interested in that and
yeah and back there it's just my usual
it's like my old beauty blenders and
different brand Beauty sponges and then
like some sponge tip applicator czar
used for a cream shadow so yeah so
that's what's back there but those are
trying to always back there I hope that
was fun to watch I know it was fun to
make anyway so I'm sure in a few weeks I
will have a new installment with other
products I'm trying out but I hope that
was fun to watch and I'll catch you guys
very very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
