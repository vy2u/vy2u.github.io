installment of my everyday makeup drawer
where I show you basically what I'm
wearing this week or over the next two
weeks things I fished out of my
collection that I'm wanting to either
try out or they're old favorites of mine
that I wear all the time or they're just
ones that I haven't given enough love
that I want to use some more so without
further ado let's dive right in so here
is my everyday makeup drawer and just so
you know I have a pile of clothes right
there
I had an Instagram sale and it went
really really well and those are all
things I need to ship out today so so
you're gonna see that kind of in the
foreground or backward what
foreground/background they're so sorry
anyway okay so let's go ahead and start
right here the first thing that I put in
here was my Revlon Photoready BB cream I
never use this and I need to give it
some more love so this is another shot
for it I don't I don't know I almost
don't even know how I feel about it
that's how little I use it so I'm gonna
try and use it and decide how I feel
about it I also just posted a review of
this the maybelline baby skin I really
really like it and it's only five
dollars so I'll link my review below but
I in an in short form I love it it's
five bucks and there's a good amount of
product in here so definitely gonna be
using that and then I also have my
Rimmel wake me up concealer that I
really do like it really is kind of
brightening I have it in the lightest
shade well I think it's the lightest
shade it's in very fair okay I also put
in here my Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer
and I have it in the shade warm tan and
I just love it it's but I never I forget
about it I think so I wanted to pull it
out I can't even open it but anyway it's
a cream bronzer so I use a stippling
brush to use it and it's just one of
those products that I just adore I
really do but I need to remember to use
it and isn't this packaging beautiful
are you kidding me I also put in here
myself one of those duos and it's their
original they called it like blushed and
bronzed but it's just beautiful colors
and they're really really pigmented I'll
show you that doesn't really show up
pigmented days they're really pigmented
and I need to wipe it off but I really
like it I used to clearly I used to love
it but I haven't used it in a while so I
figured I'd pull it
my collection and give it some love and
then another old favorite of mine is my
NYX stay matte but not flat powder
foundation my winter shade is ivory
makes me feel like I'm an animal or
something my winter shade my winter coat
anyway okay so down here this is my
little context case and I actually used
to have a little pink one that went in
here but you should replace the little
things there in often so now I just have
them back to like a normal one it and it
doesn't even like fit in there look I've
even tried it the other kind of fits but
not really but I like that there's a
little mirror my boyfriend got this for
me so so that's in there right now
I also this is actually new to me my
Tarte eyelash curler and it was kind of
pricey but I got it for free because I
had a bunch of them like Ulta rewards
box or whatever and I'd been wanting a
new one cuz I just had like a random one
which there's nothing wrong with that
but this is really wide up here so it
captures like every single lash and I
don't know it really is nice now I don't
think I'd want it if I had had to pay
for this I wouldn't wanted to cuz well I
don't have that kind of money but it was
free essentially so I was like why not
and I really do like it okay this is the
Sigma they're like cream shadow and
persuade and you guys when I first
mentioned this I liked it but I even
said it's not my favorite it's kind of
slowly becoming my favorite because it
really does like cancel any veining on
your eyes which I do have some so it's
just a completely clean slate and I
really like it and it stays on all day
so oh I just really I really have grown
to like it
I also this is a sigma shadow they sent
in no true Dom I've been using in my
crease and I actually do like the shade
it's kind of like a purplish purplish
Brown like a taupe you know what I mean
which are like my favorite kind of
colors to wear so I really have been
liking that but I've only been using it
for about a week now this is the benefit
mmm benefit creaseless cream shadow it's
like in a little trial size and it's in
the shade RSVP it's like a pink
champagne color I've been using on my
lids a lot this is my L'Oreal lacquer
liner I use all the time in
this is my single shadow from what Milan
brulee I use all the time to blend
shadows together then as you know if
you've seen my 2013 best in beauty my
the jammy Awards this is my favorite
favorite mascara the scandalized retro
glam it's a new product and you guys I
am so obsessed with it it's just just
watch that video in I explain why it's
absolutely amazing oh my gosh okay and
then I just have random I have my this
is a covergirl perfect point plus I've
just been using to tightline I'm trying
to get rid of it's lasting forever
there's not even like writing on it
anymore this is like Physicians Formula
I booster liner I use all the time what
is this oh this is a green when one of
my I love these the Jordana 12-hour once
and it's in Jade jewel it's just a dark
green one but I just I really like it
I've been using on my lower lash line
the past few days and I really do like
it
another one I use my lower lash line to
covergirl and so I don't know the shade
name and then also in my lower waterline
my Rimmel scandaleyes in the nude shade
so onto this so here's some lip products
one my mom got me my chapstick
candy-cane love it it's just so fun I
think these are so fun and then the
color whisper what was the shade I
picked out for this week Stryker rose
I love the formula even still of these
and then this one is one I never ever
used the Milani 3d glitzy I never use it
so I pulled it out it's kind of an
interesting shade it's in the shade
stylish and it's almost like an orange
with sparkles so we'll see how I like
that and then an EOS lip balm and sweet
mint my EOS I don't know I have a
love-hate with the OS because the other
ones I've tried I've liked but they're
still not my favorite but out of the
ones I've tried this is my favorite but
it's not my favorite lip product you
know lip balm this I love my Vaseline
lip therapy and rose whatever what is it
rosy lips I just love this stuff
I love the cocoa butter one to my Beauty
Blender which I haven't used in a while
I've been using my brushes my Anastasia
brow powder and medium brown I used
every single week all the time as I use
this as well the Anastasia clear brow
gel
my eye makeup remover pen from ELF which
is a lifesaver
just some eyebrow like tweezers and
scissors and things like that and then
this I've been trying out this week it's
the L'Oreal youth code and it's just I
got it at Big Lots for like three
dollars but it has like a metal
applicator in it so it like feels really
cool when you put it on your under eye I
like it I've used it for a week and I
like the way it feels and I don't know
how well it's doing just yet but so far
I do like it and I got it
you know incredibly cheap so another
thing I have back here kind of stuffed I
usually keep it here or somewhere like
that but just for this video I just have
it out of the way is the new palette I
got from starlooks they sent to me it
was there a December star box it's like
a hundred dollar palette which is insane
but I mean the shadows are certainly
freaking bomb star bomb star I'm oh what
I'm struggling through this video you
guys I'm just like making words up bomb
star all right well these are bomb star
shadows and that means that they're
awesome and especially this bottom row
let me swatch a few cuz I really do love
this palette
oh-ho-ho isn't that gorgeous oh my gosh
now I got to find a place wipe this off
i'ma wipe it on my hand these shadows
are absolutely beautiful this is their
New Year's Eve 2014 palette and guess
what I use it on New Year's Eve oh okay
oh and then I have my naked 1 and Naked
2 palettes here so there's that I mean I
use my naked 2 more often the naked one
so that's why it's in front but I just
always keep them I spend a lot of money
on them and I want to get a lot of use
out of them so that's why they're kind
of there and then back there is just
like random 3d white strips extra Beauty
Blender old Beauty blenders I should say
so that is everything in my everyday
makeup drawer for this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
