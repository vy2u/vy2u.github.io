another installment of my everyday
makeup drawer series which is my
favorite series that I do in this if you
haven't caught any of mine before it's
just basically I give you a tour of what
is in my one makeup drawer in my
collection that I essentially use every
single day so in it I always switch it
out every couple of weeks which is why
I'm able to update these all the time I
switch out a lot of the products every
week to make sure that I'm utilizing all
the makeup in my collection and if I'm
noticing that there are things in my
collections that I either haven't tried
yet or I know that I like and I haven't
used in a long time I put them in there
maybe new products or maybe old
favorites it's always a really good mix
and this is a good way for me to kind of
see to make myself use them and then to
see if I don't like it I need to just
get rid of it or if I'm finding that I'm
still not using it even in my everyday
makeup drawer I need to get rid of it so
I love these videos and I hope that you
guys do too and that weird anyway here
we go
so here is the drawer where I keep it
all in this container I got from Target
in the closet organization section if
you are curious we'll just start back
here actually this is a Tarte eyelash
curler that I got with some Rewards
points that I had at Ulta and I love it
because it's wider than most so it
really captures every lash without like
pinching anything you know I just really
like it and then this is just my
tweezers and eyebrows scissors and then
this is what I use to set my under eye
concealer when I set it which is not
every single day but it's there
Amazonian clay smooth operator powder
then here I've got my Pilate Oh rice
powder I'm noticing I'm not using that
often so I decided to put it in here to
give it some love it's it's a really
nice powder I just never reached for it
because when I open it the way that the
packaging is it just gets so messy so so
messy so that's why I think that's why I
don't reach for it very often but I also
have the wet and wild by Fergie see I've
already got stuff on it from that it's
pretty
what's this called the what is it calm
it's a shimmer palette Oh in Rose a
champagne glow and it's just so such a
pretty highlight you can almost use it
as a blush on its own it'd be a super
shimmery blush but but I really like it
as a highlight kind of on top of my
blush then here's kind of my eye studio
this is a star looks cream shadow slash
gel eyeliner I use it as a cream shadow
in Milky Way that's this really pretty
white that I just got so I want to try
that out this my friend sent to me and
it's this elf duo and actually I've
already used it and I really like it the
duo is it's just got a bunch of numbers
back there so I don't know but it's so
pretty I love these green shadows with
brown eyes this is a be a bombshell I
shadow in birthday suit and it's for me
it's a perfect nude color to blend all
my shadows together this oh my gosh this
is one of those Maybelline Color tattoo
pigments and it's in the shade bear what
does it barely brazen and it is
absolutely stunning I'm like shouting
about it it is the most gorgeous color
on the lid you've ever seen it reminds
me of Steel Akutan I think it's kind of
a dupe for it so maybe I'll do a dupes
video soon this is the L'Oreal gel
eyeliner I use all the time it's almost
gone though and maybe I'll branch out
but I love this that's the gel eyeliner
back here I've got some lip products I'm
using this is one that I kind of forgot
I had it's the L'Oreal I'm not sure what
the line is called but it's in pink
perseverance it's just a really pretty
light pink that I like this is a newer
product for me the rim will show off lip
lacquer it's in the shade is this one
Nova no I think this one's actually
called apocalypse yeah Oh a pock
elliptic is the name of the shadow what
the shade what this my friend sent me
and it's in Dolce caramello or Dulce
Caramella and it's one of the Milani
ones and I already love the other Milani
when I have so I'm excited to give this
one a try and show it some love this one
I'm wearing today if you in the intro oh
I love it it's from the brand Besame and
I got it in a wantable box and it's in
the shade exotic pink and it is the most
beautiful I think it's a do I unscrew to
pull it I'm not gonna be able open this
one hand did you guys I need to get I
need to use the tribe
come on the bronzer I'm using is this
covergirl bronzer and copper radiance I
haven't used it in a while and I used to
love it so I'm gonna give it some more
love over here I've got my this is an
oldie my NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk I
haven't used it in so long and I use it
this morning I was like oh yeah I forgot
why I loved it it's all like beat up but
it's a really good one and I just
haven't used it in so long this is a Mac
quad my friend sent me and it's in the
shade caramel sundae it's from the
Archies girl collection and I just
haven't given it a lot of lovely at
least so I'm going to use it some more
because those shadows are absolutely
gorgeous
then this product here is the be a
bombshell it's they're like one stick if
you will and send the shade flustered I
use it on my cheeks today and I like it
but I'm trying to get you see it's a
stick blush so I'm trying to get used to
using those cuz I'm just really not very
good at and then this lip liner I've
been wearing with that Besame one is a
L'Oreal lip precision in the pinks roses
I think I got this at like the Dollar
Tree but it's actually really good then
I'm also going to be using this
Physicians Formula i booster liner it's
a liquid liner that I love and then for
my brows I just recently got this one
the Milani brow they're easy brow and
it's in the shade taupe and I really
like it so I'm gonna I'm gonna give it
some more lovin I'm just loving it
then the mascara I'll be using is the
benefit they're real it's just a deluxe
sized eye it's really volumizing but I
almost can't use it at first like I have
to use a different mascara then put this
one on top because it's like it's just
too much I don't know I need to I think
it needs to dry out a little bit more
for my liking I think that's all in that
section for my foundation it looks so
old and it's actually not let me shake
it up this is the covergirl trublend and
the old packaging and so I'm giving this
one a try I love it as a pump and I got
it on clearance for 2 or 3 dollars so
this is what I'm using for my when I use
my Mac Pro Longwear concealer it looks
so dark in the in this screen that's
layers but when I pump this it's enough
for freaking three days of use so I've
been pumping it into this just into the
lid of that that way I can use it and
not have to just waste that so that's
been working out pretty well and then
the benefit Porefessional you guys my
closet door just opened and no one was
over there I have a
in my house what is going on okay
benefit Porefessional my friend sent me
and it's so good holy crap I can't
believe I've gone this long without
using it it is amazing and then my
maybelline dream learning concealer is
one of my favorites that for brightening
it's in the shade radiant and I just
love it
my grandma EOS sweet mint it's almost
gone so I'm gonna need to get a new one
out of all the EOS is that is my
favorite hands-down it's actually
moisturizing to me it's just it's just
really good I love it
then my mac fix+ I recently hauled I've
been using I don't use it every single
day and I'm still deciding how I like it
but I just got the smaller size for eye
primer I'm using my wet and wild by
Fergie one that I like a lot I just
don't use all the time
got my ELF zit zapper for when I need it
I've got my elf makeup remover pen I use
all the time and then for my brow gel
I'm using this essence one that my
friend sent me and it's their lash and
brow gel mascara and I've actually been
liking it a lot so I'm gonna keep using
it some more and decide how I like it
because I know a lot of people ask me
how I'm just liking it I'll have to keep
you updated so if you guys want to see
links to purchase a lot of the products
that I mentioned in this video not all
of them but a lot of them as well as
just other favorites I've had you can go
to my love ah Chrissy page which I will
have linked below and that's basically a
Pinterest board for I mean it's for
anything but of course mine is mostly
makeup and beauty related and you can
actually buy stuff from there instead of
you know on Pinterest you click on it
and you can never find out where to buy
it on this one who actually can't buy
from the site so it's really really it's
a really cool site I'm kind of falling
in love with it so if you're interested
