next installment can you tell I'm
excited my everyday makeup drawer I even
do one of these so long because I did my
makeup collection and I was decluttering
I mean there were so many different
things I was kind of doing and changing
with my collection and so I'm so excited
to get back to this
I searched the other day on YouTube for
everyday makeup to her and I saw a few
people have been doing them some people
mentioned me that they were inspired by
me which was so cool because I think
it's such a helpful video idea I mean I
didn't even really create it I think I
saw like someone was just showing what
was in their everyday makeup bag and I
thought well I use a drawer so why not
share that with you guys and it changes
so it's not even like it was my idea but
I just started incorporating it
regularly that's really I guess the
difference anyway
so so excited to show you guys what's in
my drawer right now there's a lot of new
things that I've been trying this has
been kind of the time of year that I've
gotten a lot of new things and I kind of
go through hills and valleys when it
comes to that world you have a lot of
new things and then I'll just stay with
the same which I have to have those
valleys or else my collection would be
out of this world and you guys know I
declutter all the time and get rid of
stuff I just can't stand having like
stuff around I did it's my closet too I
get rid of clothes like crazy cool
anyway here is what is in my everyday
makeup drawer so I still keep my
everyday makeup in my top right drawer
just because I'm right-handed just kind
of makes sense to me you know so let's
go ahead and dig right in this is just a
general overview of the way I have it
organized and what I'm using I'm using
something different than I typically use
I got these little acrylic containers
from where did I get it Oh Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond I actually just ordered them
online coz the Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond near me
is like 30 minutes away and I'm never on
that side of town so but they were I
want to say like three or four dollars
which isn't bad and they're made of a
little bit thicker acrylic which I like
and I just liked the size of these
especially for this drawer and then I
have a bigger one from the same brand
and I will find these and link them
below for both of the different sizes
that I have but I really like them of
course this was more like 6 dollars I
think something like that but
big-mouthed me on is great about having
20% off coupons to use and then this is
from the Dollar Tree just like a little
office
sherry holder but I use it for other
things so let's go ahead and dig right
in
so in this bigger section I have my
eyeshadows that I'm trying to use this
is a Maybelline quad called mocha motion
and it's got the prettiest colors but I
just don't find myself using it that
often so I'm trying to make myself these
are all colors I've totally right up my
alley so I'm gonna put it in here so I
see it and use it look at those colors
oh I love them whoops anyway so that's
in there so I'll use it my naked basics
just because I look for it all the time
so it just kind of makes sense for me to
have it in here you know then I have
another eyeshadow this is a Knick single
eyeshadow an SOS that I just adore oh my
gosh so this it's literally it's been in
this drawer ever since I bought it a
month or two ago and I can't stop using
it then I also have my bare minerals
concealer and well rested that I
recently got that I use every single day
and right now I've got a lot of dry skin
around my eyes and somehow this finds
the way to conceal my eyes without
making it look any drier than it already
is it's really nice okay my Rimmel stay
matte this is actually the darker shade
it's in 0:04 sandstorm and the reason I
am using the darker shade is because
I've been using actually just natural
glow lotion but I'm a lot tanner then I
have been so this makes more sense I
also have self tanner but I haven't
really pulled that out yet so but with
natural glow it's got a really nice it's
really deep in my skin tone more than it
was that's for sure anyway this is a new
product I got a laura geller lip spackle
that I'm trying to use you're gonna see
a lot of Laura Geller once this is
supposed to like mute out your lips so
then you can put lipstick on top of it
and it's true to its color I don't know
I'm a little intimidated by this but I'm
gonna give it a shot I also have my
Ashley Hackman by starlooks gel liner
just in black I really really like it I
can't stop using it to be honest and
then these are the three lip colors I'm
using right now this I got in that
target beauty box that I gave away to
one of you guys and it's just the lip
gloss and blind date and it's just so
fun and I think for this time of year
it's really nice I just haven't really
used it so I'm gonna make myself use it
so my last two lip products are an NYC
one in fuchsia fusion and it's just a
really pretty
color gotten an Influenster box so I'm
excited to give it a try and then the
Rimmel airy-fairy which I got a long
time ago from my friend but I really
don't use it often and I need to so I
pulled that out so back here is just a
bunch of products I use everyday this is
a Tokyo milk lip balm just redness
relief eyedrops my like eyebrow things
this is the elf kabuki brush i've been
using for bronzing up my face a little
bit and then this is the brush that I've
been using to contour with sometimes
from the hoola little bronzer box and
then right here this is another new
product of mine that laura geller
spackle tinted under makeup primer and
it's in the shade at the real and it's
really just like this really pretty kind
of kind of shimmery primer so I haven't
used it yet and that's why it's in here
because I want to give it a try but I
got it on HauteLook
all of these laura geller products and
you're gonna see a few more I got crazy
cheap on HauteLook and package deals so
it's awesome and then over here is my
Revlon Colorstay whipped you guys I fell
back in love with this
I forgot how wonderful it is I have in
the shade 150 buff which is perfect for
me right now it's just the most
beautiful satin finish on my skin so I'm
excited to have pulled that back out
these are three new Laura Gallup rock
Geller products so this is the one I
love the most so far and it is it the
balanced and brighten in fair and it's
just a really pretty kind of powder
foundation it does kind of what I was
hoping the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in diffused light would do for me
this does it I really really like this
and then I also got the balance and
bronze bronzer it's just so really it's
got the balance and brighten there and
then this bronze there so it just kind
of makes for this kind of bronze II kind
of not it's really perfect let me show
you kind of a swatch of it for if your
fair skin tone it really is perfect and
then this is a Laura Geller product it's
a at the real rose and sateen subtle
berry that's such a weird name so it's
kind of a mixture and this I've been
wearing as a blush and it's just a
really pretty it's just a really pretty
blush isn't that just like this one it's
so pretty so I've really been loving
these and these are all baked and I just
like them here I have my Maybelline age
rewind in the brightener shade I just
really really like and like I said I've
got a lot of dryness under my eyes right
now and this has been kind of just feels
nice on it and then my ELF zip zapper
and elf makeup remover pen which I use
every single day in this very last one I
had a lot of things so I've got a liquid
liner from BH Cosmetics my Anastasia
brow Wiz that I love but look all the
writing has just worn off it makes me so
sad
I hate when products do that which might
sound silly but I like to be able see
what it says this is the anasazi a clear
brow gel with two mascaras in here the
Palladio curls rule did you guys know I
love I'm trying out the Too Faced better
than sex mascara I'm really liking it so
far but it seems to be drying out
quickly which I've heard from other
people too I have an elf
primer and liner sealer they're using
the Urban Decay 24/7 velvet pencil in
black velvet I really really like that
it does not move once you put it on and
I also haven't here this pull audio
liner in ultra violet which is just like
this deep purple that I really like and
that is everything that's in my drawer
