to share with you my updated everyday
makeup drawer and if you are just
stumbling upon my channel or if you've
just never seen one of these videos of
mine than one of my favorites to make
because I share with you guys what is in
like the drawer that I go to every
single morning it's kind of pretty much
the only one eye open so what I do out
of all my makeup collection which I've
got more than I could ever need or use
in one day that is or ever probably but
in that drawer I put either products
that I love that I know I want to use
everyday or products I just got that I'm
trying to kind of try out in case I want
to review them or tell you guys about
them and also just products that I feel
like they're in my collection they're
just sitting there and I'm not using
them enough it's great because I just
have one place I can go to each day that
I know if I'm in a rush I can get
everything I need in this one drawer I
don't have to peel through drawers but
if I've got the time then I can branch
out and get other stuff so I update this
I try and do it at least once a month
sometimes more often sometimes less
often just to keep myself kind of fresh
and using different makeup and not kind
of getting in a rut but also to make
sure that i am trying out new things and
things like that so hopefully this video
is helpful for you guys in here we go
here's kind of an overview of my
everyday makeup drawer right now I
always switch up kind of which
containers i'm using based on which
products i'm keeping in here right now i
have some from the container store this
one and this one are from the same line
if I find them I'll try and like a blow
and this is just from the dollar tree
and the rest are not in containers so
let's go ahead and get closer so in this
front section I keep some concealers I'm
gonna use my hard candy corn my flaws I
tarina tarantino once a little bit dirty
um that I got I think in a boxy charm
I'd like a brightening concealer I've
got like my Rimmel scandaleyes liquid
liner wet and wild primer that I just
feel like has not been getting enough
love in my collection I've got a star
looks liner in blue chill that I love to
use on my lower lashline I think I just
got my last star box a model co liner I
got in the past in black this is my
anastacio brow Wiz that I use every day
anasazi a little travel-size brow gel i
also use every day and then my old love
that I just rediscovered my L'Oreal
voluminous mascara oh my goodness I love
it so that's not keeping in there for
this week or this month right here I've
got my wet and wild reserve your cabana
little bronzer but of course it's more
of a highlight for me that I love it's
just a really natural looking one and
then this I got in the media box
recently it's a lip scrub thing that I
like so I've tried it once and I want to
continue to use it I all saw this
kinerase c8 peptide under eye treatments
really expensive but I got it on
hautelook for a lot cheaper and so far I
like it I don't know that it's worth the
money just yet but I use it at night and
then my Beauty Blender that I need to
clean so this is the bulk of my
collection that i'm using right now so
over here I've got my mac qua that I
always switch up what's in it this is
Mac rice paper mac sable omega and then
this is elfs what do they call i think
this is in the shade taupe it's one of
my favorite shadows of all time you can
tell so when it's from outfits a dog and
here is my favorite tarina tarantino duo
that I got on hautelook long time ago
got my gel liner from star looks from
the Ashley Hackman collection
bellapierre it's in gold and brown this
like shimmer that I really like to use
on my eyes and I'm kind of trying out
right now back here I've got some lip
products these two to face ones i got
for like eight dollars they're
originally like 20 something but i got
them for eight bucks on hautelook this
is in what does it call in the buff and
it's just this beautiful buff color and
the packaging is just so amazing but
it's so perfect for like work and then I
also got this Too Faced glamour gloss in
strip pleased that I like and this I've
been trying out I've had for a while
this NYC lip color and is in the same
shade forever fuchsia I was wearing it
at the beginning of this video I really
really like this stuff and then one of
my favorite lip liners the knicks nude
pink I use all the time so I just keep
it in there and then my Nivea kissamint
and minerals I usually put on right
before I met to start doing my makeup
back here I've got my mac natural or
mineralized skin finish natural and I
have it in the shade medium for right
now I got it at a CCO for a lot cheaper
than it usually would be so then my
hoola bronzer I didn't use the while
side
that back out Mac full of joy I also got
to the CCO and I just it's such a
beautiful kind of light plum color like
almost like lavender and I've been using
it this week and I've gotten a lot of
compliments so I really really like this
color and then here i got my Nivea lip
butter it's almost gone look you guys
look how I'm almost done with although
i'll probably buy it because i love it
it makes my lips so soft but it does
kind of look really milky on your lips
until it sinks in so for about 3 minutes
you look like you have white stuff all
over your lips but then it sinks in this
gorgeous but you can't really put it on
when you're out and about unless you
have a few minutes before you're around
people that I have my bare minerals
concealer and well rested it's just a
powder concealer I love to set whatever
concealer i'm using with this because it
really brightens the area and it seems
to set the concealer really well i just
eye concealer like 10 times this is a
sigma i basin persuade this is something
they sent to me when i first became an
affiliate and I just I just like it I
didn't at first because it was kind of
an odd color for my skin tone but it
mutes out the eye area so perfectly so
that it's a clean slate and I've never
found one that's quite as good as that
one so I pulled that sucker back out and
then next to this is just my mary kay
setting spray that skin dinnae via makes
for them that I really have fallen in
love with so I leave that in there and
then back here I just have my too faced
natural eye palette that I love oh my
gosh I love it and then I also have a
tarina tarantino blot dull skin cheek
palette but I mostly use it for the
giant mirror but I also love that
there's just a range of blushes in there
but I really honestly have it here for
the mirror and that terrible back here
by the way is just a coaster I can pull
out when I need it then I've got my
moisturizer I use every day it's Paula's
Choice resist lotion that I just love
it's got a little tint to it but it also
has SPF and it's just so perfect under
foundation because it's not too greasy
and then the foundation I'm using right
now is the Revlon age-defying makeup i'm
using the shade 10 which is bare buff
which would be way too dark for me any
other time other than summer so it's
working right now but in about
month there's no way I can pull this off
so right now it works but not always and
then I've just got my chart eyelash
curler that I use every day and that is
everything in my everyday makeup drawer
that was enjoyable for you guys if you'd
like I can link the playlist for all of
my other everyday makeup drawers from
the past down below I think I've done
like eight or nine other ones I'm not
sure somewhere in there but hopefully
you enjoy them I know I do and I'll
catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
