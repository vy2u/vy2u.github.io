to share with you my updated everyday
makeup drawer and if you are just
stumbling upon my channel or if you've
just never seen one of these videos of
mine then one of my favorites to make
because I share with you guys what is it
like the drawer that I go to every
single morning it's kind of pretty much
the only one I open
so what I do out of all my makeup
collection which I've got more than I
could ever need or use in one day that
is or ever probably but in that drawer I
put either products that I love that I
know I want to use everyday or products
I just got that I'm trying to kind of
try out in case I want to review them or
tell you guys about them and also just
products that I feel like they're in my
collection they're just sitting there
and I'm not using them enough it's great
because I just have one place I can go
to each day that I know if I'm in a rush
I can get everything I need in this one
drawer I don't have to peel through
drawers but if I've got the time then I
can branch you out and get other stuff
so I update this I try and do it at
least once a month sometimes more often
sometimes less often just to keep myself
kind of fresh and using different makeup
and not kind of getting in a rut but
also to make sure that I am trying out
new things and things like that so
hopefully this video is helpful for you
guys in here we go
here's kind of an overview of my
everyday makeup drawer right now I
always switch up kind of watch
containers I'm using based on which
products I'm keeping in here right now I
have some from the Container Store this
one and this one are from the same line
if I find them I'll try and link and
below and this is just from the Dollar
Tree and the rest are not in containers
so let's go ahead and get closer so in
this front section I keep some
concealers I'm gonna use my hard candy
glamoflauge I Terina Tarantino one it's
a little bit dirty um that I got I think
in a boxy charm
I'd like a brightening concealer I've
got like my Rimmel scandaleyes liquid
liner wet and wild primer that I just
feel like has not been getting enough
love in my collection I've got a
starlooks liner in blue chill that I
love to use on my lower lash line I
think I just got in my last star box a
model Co liner I got in the past in
black
my Nastasia brow whiz that I use every
day on asaji a little travel-size brow
gel i also use every day and then my old
love that i just rediscovered my l'oreal
voluminous mascara oh my goodness i love
it so that's keeping in there for this
week or this month right here I've got
my wet and wild reserved your Cabana
little bronzer but of course it's more
of a highlight for me that I love it's
just a really natural looking one and
then this I got in a meanie box recently
it's a lip scrub thing that I like so
I've tried it once and I want to
continue to use it I also have this can
erase si8 peptide under-eye treatments
really expensive but I got it on
HauteLook for a lot cheaper and so far I
like it I don't know that it's worth the
money just yet but I use it at night and
then my Beauty Blender that I need to
clean so this is the bulk of my
collection that I'm using right now so
over here I've got my Mac quad that I
always switch up what's in it this is
Mac rice paper Mac sable Omega and then
this is elfs what do they call I think
this is in the shade taupe it's one of
my favorite shadows of all time you can
tell so when it's from outfits $1 and
here is my favorite Tarina Tarantino duo
that I got on HauteLook a long time ago
got my gel liner from Starr looks from
the Ashley Hackman collection
bellapierre it's in gold and brown this
like shimmer that I really like to use
on my eyes and I'm kind of trying out
right now back here I've got some lip
products these two Too Faced ones I got
for like eight dollars they're
originally like 20-something but I got
them for eight bucks on HauteLook this
is in what does it call in the buff and
it's just this beautiful buff color and
the packaging is just so amazing but
it's so perfect for ever like work and
then I also got this Too Faced glamour
gloss in strip tease that I like and
this I've been trying out I've had for a
while this my C lip color and isn't this
a shade forever fuchsia I was wearing it
at the beginning in this video I really
really like this stuff and then one of
my favorite lip liners the NYX nude pink
I use all the time so I just keep it in
there and then my Nivea kiss of mint and
minerals I usually put on right before
I'm have to start doing my makeup back
here I've got my Mac natural or
mineralized skinfinish natural and I
have it in the shade medium for right
now I got it on a CCO for a lot cheaper
than it usually would be
then my hoola bronzer I haven't used a
while so I pulled that back out Mack
full of joy I also got to the CCO and I
just it's such a beautiful kind of light
plum color like almost like lavender and
I've been using it this week and I've
gotten a lot of compliments so I really
really like this color and then here
I've got my Nivea lip butter it's almost
gone look you guys look how I am almost
done with although I'll probably rebuy
it because I love it it makes my lips so
soft but it does kind of look really
milky on your lips until it sinks in so
for about three minutes you look like
you have white stuff all over your lips
but then it sinks in and it's gorgeous
but you can't really put it on when
you're out and about unless you have a
few minutes before you're around people
then I have my bare minerals concealer
and well rested it's just a powder
concealer I love to set whatever
concealer I'm using with this cuz it
really brightens the area and it seems
to set that conceal it really well I
just said concealer like ten times this
is a sigma eye Basin pursuade this is
something they sent to me when I first
became an affiliate and I just I just
liked it I didn't at first because it
was kind of an odd color for my skintone
but it mutes out the eye area so
perfectly so that it's a clean slate and
I've never found one that's quite as
good as that one so I pulled that sucker
back out and then next to this is just
my mary kay setting spray that skin to
Naevia makes for them that I really have
fallen in love with so I leave that in
there and then back here I just have my
Too Faced natural eye palette that I
love oh my gosh I love it and then I
also have a Terina Terrence you know
blot dull skin cheek palette but I
mostly use it for the giant mirror but I
also love that there's just a range of
blushes in there but I really honestly
have it here for the mirror and that
terrible back here by the way it's just
a coaster I can pull out when I need it
then I've got my moisturizer I use every
day its Paula's Choice resist lotion
that I just love it's got a little tint
to it but it also has SPF and it's just
so perfect under foundation because it's
not too greasy and then the foundation
I'm using right now is the Revlon
age-defying makeup I'm using the shade
10 which is bare buff which would be way
too dark for me any other time other
than summer so it's working right now
but in about of
month there's no way I can pull this off
so right now it works but not always and
then I've just got my chart eyelash
curler that I use every day and that is
everything in my everyday makeup drawer
I hope that was enjoyable for you guys
if you'd like I can link the playlist
for all of my other everyday makeup
drawers from the past down below I think
I've done like eight or nine other ones
I'm not sure somewhere in there but
hopefully you enjoy them I know I do and
I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
