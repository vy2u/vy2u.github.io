with you guys my everyday makeup drawer
for December I've been doing this for a
couple years now and I just love showing
you guys kind of out of my collection
what I'm using right now whether it's an
old product that I feel like I'm
forgetting about forgetting to use or
maybe it's brand new that it was just
sent to me or that I just purchased that
I'm wanting to try out or if it's just
something that I love that I really do
use everyday so I want it right there in
my everyday makeup drawer so without
further ado let's go ahead an get into
it so here's kind of a brief overview of
the drawer right now this container I
bought they're really really cheap like
literally but you can buy a pack of
three on Amazon for under ten dollars if
I can still find them I'll link it below
but they're really like bendy and cheap
so don't expect high-quality because
they're not but they like that they were
white and I like that I can just wipe
them down really easily and frankly I
liked that when I feel completely tired
of it and I've totally used it up I can
just recycle it so let's go ahead and
get into it so right here I've got this
benefit hervana blush which I love it's
just a really pretty swirl of colors I
love all of the box blushes but I felt
like I keep forgetting about this one so
I wanted to use it this is actually I
hit pan on the Kevyn Aucoin sculpting
powder and medium it's the most
beautiful kind of topi shade it stays on
all day it's one of the few products
that I will splurge on again and again
cuz I love it this is a duo I actually
already swatched it here in Jasper and
it's from Tarina Tarantino and it's just
so gorgeous I love these shadows and I
keep forgetting about them so I wanted
to remember to use them
this is my mary-lou manizer from the
balm again it keeps getting lost in my
highlighter collection just a really
beautiful shimmery highlight and then
this is new to me this is from our
glasses they're ambient lighting powder
in luminous light and it's really just a
beautiful finishing powder I put it all
over especially like down the bridge of
my nose and up in the middle of my
forehead etc it's got a little shimmer
to it but not too much
I love
it and it just sits on the skin so
beautifully where it doesn't look like
it's sitting on the skin here in the
middle I've just got kind of random
things I've got my it cosmetics brow
power I'm trying out it's just a
universal color and then I also have my
NYX control freak brow gel so I use
those two together every single day my
black pencil liner this month is going
to be the Lancome one these are just all
of them are amazing they have like a
million shades
this is the NYC liquid eyeliner I'm
continuing to try out it's growing on me
it has a brush that's a little more like
I don't know difficult to use it's just
a straight up brush but I still like it
and it's really really black so I'm
still working with that I also have
another liquid liner which is the
L'Oreal voluminous superstar I've been
using and it's more of a it's a felt-tip
one and it really it's pretty black too
and then I have my favorite mascara
right now which is the Lancome Hypnose
drama it's amazing I showed it my
November favorites it's oh my gosh it
just it curls your lashes at volume I it
does everything you want and it stays
like that all day it's amazing over here
I've got just a couple pallets my
maybelline lipgloss palette I'm still
trying to use I did my review and lip
swatch video for you guys it's just when
I was watching I hit pan on so many of
them that was my main gripe and it's
just not something that unless you're
like a makeup artist and in which case
if you are I still would probably get a
different brand but it's just okay I
wasn't like thoroughly impressed but
it's not bad it's just not like the best
thing in the world then I also have this
is new to me the Too Faced chocolate bon
bons palette it is so beautiful you guys
I mean I love it it smells like
chocolate their shadows are just
gorgeous and let me swatch some this is
molasses chip satin sheets is one of my
favorites look at these I mean they're
unbelievable let's do like this pink one
yeah I mean I don't know if I'd wear the
pink but they're so beautiful oh my gosh
I just love to face shadows and they
smell and taste like chocolate and then
I also have my L'Oreal love palette nude
one I ended up getting rid of my new too
after a while I did my review video of
it a long time ago and I just love these
shadows I'm so impressed
with them and every time I pull it back
out to use it I always get compliments
on my look I just I really like this
shade here I don't feel that the
shimmery shades are the best they're not
terrible but I just have better so I
usually pull in like you know a shade
like from this or maybe even now from
this Too Faced palette just for my lid
but the rest of them are beautiful and
they blend really well so if you're
looking for a drugstore palette I love
that one back here I've got some lip
products this is a beauty for real
lipliner in like Universal I'm actually
wearing it at the beginning and end of
this video and it's just a really normal
kind of rosy toned lip liner it stays
put I'm just trying it out right now
I've only used it like twice and then
this is one that was getting lost in my
collection my NYX mega shine lip gloss
in beige it's the most beautiful non
beige color it's just this really nice
just a pink gloss but it just looks
beautiful on the lips it makes my lips
look so healthy I love it and then one
of my splurge e things that I own this
is the rouge ville upped by YSL and
number one and it's just this gorgeous
light peachy color it's so beautiful
these smell crazy like water mom but I
like it
which is rare for me I also pulled out
this pur eye polish I got rid of some of
these because they were colors I didn't
use I pass them on to sisters this one I
was actually gonna get rid of and I
ended up pulling out of my declutter
pile because I saw someone use it and I
was like oh my gosh that is beautiful
and then I like really used it one day
and I was like yep glad I pulled this
back out it is the most beautiful like
oh my gosh I've got too many swatches on
my hand look at that isn't that gorgeous
so I was like yeah I'm gonna need to
keep that so I've been using that and
then I also have my liquid or my cream
liner by mica beauty which is almost
gone I really really like over here I
have one of my favorite lip balms the co
Bigelow of my favorite night balm I have
this Milani shadow eyes and almond cream
I used just as a base on my eyes before
putting on shadow it's wonderful then I
have my Milani eyeshadow primer for when
I don't want to use that they're both
awesome Milani makes really great eye
primers I also this is a concealer I've
been trying out by Revlon Photoready I
usually hate stick concealers but this
one has been so creamy and it stays put
could not believe this might be one of
the first stick concealers I've ever
tried that I've really liked and then
this Mac pigment in vanilla which is
just this gorgeous pigment a lot of
these were in my November favorites so
you might have already seen a lot of
this stuff back here I just have this
new little guy to my collection he's
called an eggy and he holds your like
Beauty Blender type products so and it's
got little air holes on the bottom so
you can let it air out I love that just
some nonsense
well my no nonsense items like my
sharpener tweezers eyedrops etc but then
I've got my Neutrogena Healthy Skin
glows years I've been using it's a
tinted moisturizer I'm trying to use
more tinted moisturizers it truly is
illuminating though so if you already
have oily skin you might have to you
know work with it a little bit but I
really like it and then oh man my new
favorite the skin to Navy makeup primer
spray love that
then the Sonia Kashuk brightening powder
oh my gosh this stuff is wonderful at
brightening your under-eye or anywhere
it's just a loose powder it's got a
little glitter in it though so if you
don't like that you wouldn't like it I
used to not like that kind of thing but
it's kind of grown on me and then one of
my favorites it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination this is in
almost every video because I use it
every single day and I love it just a
gorgeous kind of glowy powder foundation
and now that I mess my entire tour up
from how it was organized that is
everything in my everyday makeup tour
for this month I have an entire playlist
of these videos I can link below if you
want to watch some of my past months

couple of years and if you enjoyed I
