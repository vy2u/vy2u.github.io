share with you my newest for February
2016 everyday makeup drawer video it
started these long long ago and lots of
people here on YouTube now do them and
it's so exciting because I I love
watching them so selfishly
I loved it a lot if you aren't doing
them so other than that if you've never
seen one of these videos before it's
basically my drawer right there that I
go to first in the morning when I'm
getting ready I fill it with products
that I'm wanting to use up or products
that I'm trying out for the first time
or just products that I love or I feel
like they've gotten lost in my
collection I want to use some more so
without further ado let's go ahead and
get into it okay so here is an overview
of my drawer I just have these cheap
little actually all one piece from
Amazon it came in a three pack they're
really really bendy and kind of not well
constructed not really expensive
material by any means but it really does
work to organize it all and I like that
it's white it just kind of blends right
into the drawer so I will link those
below if you're interested there it's I
think it was like three for $15 or
something they're great so over here I
have a bunch of products I'm trying out
so this is the boots number seven
liftand luminate foundation and what
shade do I have it in warm ivory it's
working so well well so far it's a good
shade for me and I've only tried it
maybe three days but each each day it
looked pretty nice so I'm still trying
that out though this is a yl product
that I got from Influenster it's the two
chicano Trull Iser and so far I am NOT
impressed to be honest like I tried it
thinking oh wow this is gonna be amazing
no it was not great but I'll continue to
try that out this pur just sent to me
it's their Hydra fluid and I have only
tried this once but I'm really into BB
creams right now and this is kind of
that idea I think it's more of a
foundation but it's already kind of
weird there so I don't know I'm gonna
keep trying it out though again lots of
new products there this has become a
favorite primer of mine this is the
Maybelline master prime in the blur and
illuminate I love it I use it everyday
and if you've got normal or dry skin you
would love it I think if you have oily
skin you might not love it as much I
also have the
Milani eyeshadow primer in here I just
have kind of forgotten about my
collection I really like and it's like 5
bucks and it's a great eyeshadow primer
and then I also have this L'Oreal
extraordinaire little lip gloss in rose
melody that I really really like I've
been watching a lot of things on my
hands so it's my hands all like shimmery
right now I just really like this
formula and I wanted to use it some more
this month here I have a bunch of new
elf things this is their like cream
shadow and peach perfection and it's
actually a really pretty color I've only
used it once though this is their total
face palette and I I'm actually wearing
these three colors today I just really
like this their colors all actually wear
so I've been really impressed with that
this is their cream contour palette
which I'm excited to try a little more
I've only used it once and it stayed
surprisingly long but I want to I want
to try it some more back here I've got
some lip products this actually one of
my students gave me for my birthday
it's the unique lipstick and conceded
and this formula is so pigmented and
creamy and that color pink is really
pretty so I'm excited to try that out
and it was so sweet of her and then this
is the covergirl well I lost it it's
getting lost in the caverns the carnival
Oh sugar in number 3 caramel and I just
like these they're I mean you literally
can barely see it if you can see
anything it's just a really lightly
tinted lip color and I really like it I
don't think they're super moisturizing
but they're not super drying either it's
kind of in between and then this is one
I recently got in sultry Sienna this is
one of their actual lipsticks from
covergirl and I just thought that color
was really really pretty
and then one of my new favorites the
boots number 7 moisture drench lipstick
in romantic oh my gosh I just love it's
very similar to sultry Sienna but I like
this formula a little bit better I want
to get more shades I love it they're
sold at Target you'll see there's a lot
of boots number 7 in here because I'm
trying a lot of it out because I want to
do a review this is a boots number 7
translucent perfect light loose powder
and I've only used it again once or
twice so I'm excited I love the shape of
this it's kind of like oval you know
what I mean and then my old favorite
that's always in here my 8th cosmetic
celebration foundation illumination in
light it is just the most beautiful
illuminating powder foundation ever down
here I've got some blushes and face
products this is the number seven soft
dams and blush that I can't stop talking
about it's just the perfect everyday
color another perfect everyday color is
the city color be matte blush in black
berry it's almost the same shade clearly
I like that color but one that I'm
trying out to decide if I want to keep
is the benefit sugar bomb it's kind of a
frosty finish but it's so beautiful but
I feel like there it is kind of there I
feel like I'm not really wearing it very
often so I'm wanting to ensure that I
want to keep it in my collection since I
declare like every day these were sent
to me by hourglass very recently these
are their strobe light strobe lighting
pout ambient I can't even ambient strobe
lighting powders and I've got euphoric
which is kind of a I don't know kind of
candlelit one and then I also have
incandescent so this one's just a little
bit brighter than that one but they're
both absolutely beautiful but yeah this
one is more cool tone that one's a
little more golden they're beautiful
though I don't know I feel like I've got
so many highlighters I need to focus on
some so I want to try and focus on these
to see how I feel about them back here I
have kind of a random smattering of eye
products this is the Maersk mineral
eyeshadow on your toast I've been loving
wearing this on my lids it's just a
really pretty shimmery bronze color I
got in a subscription box another number
7 in its their eyeshadow trio and
cappuccino and they're just three really
pretty colors surprisingly pigmented
like beautiful actually I'm running out
of swatch room but there they are there
you can see that I really like those
then I've got a Kiko creme crush lasting
color eyeshadow and number one a
subscriber sent me and it is so
beautiful she sent me a bunch of Kiko
products that I'm really loving this one
then I've got my color pop lovely
eyeshadow which is my favorite gold
shimmer I love
it and then my Mac painterly paint-pot
that I use like every day I mean every
day I love it back here I've got tons of
things so I've got my benefit they're
real mascara I'm just kind of I actually
have never really really tried that out
so I'm trying that out then I've got one
of my favorites the Maybelline lash
discovery I love because that you can
get really in the grooves of your lashes
so I'll use this almost as like a primer
I'll put this on first then a regular
mascara then I've got some things on
trying out so my mister bomb what no the
bomb mister right now eyeliner it's
really nice this is another Keiko
product up that subscribers sent the
long-lasting stick in 0-7 it's a really
pretty kind of shimmery golden champagne
and then I've got my favorite Maybelline
brow satin brow thing where it's got the
pencil on one side and then it's got the
sponge that's got the powder on it and
that powder well that was a lot but you
can really get it like lightly applied
it brushes beautifully through your
brows I love it then I've got my Sela
stay all day liquid liner that's my
favorite black liner of all time I also
have the Urban Decay 24/7 pencil that I
really really like but I think the
Jordana one is just as good I mean
there's so many drugstore ones that are
just as good as that you don't have to
spend the money this is the Milani brow
shaping clear gel that I am using right
now with my brows you can see that I'm
using it starting to turn brown that's
so gross but I love it I actually really
like the brush on this as well so that
is becoming a favorite very very quickly
then I've got two lip liners this is the
Kiko one in 302 it's just like a peach
well it's kind of a vivacious peach and
then fascias good choice my favorite
this is the colourpop lip liner and
bound it's just the perfect everyday I
mean a little deeper than everyday but
it's just the perfect color and these do
not budge I want to get a couple more
then I've got the Sonia Kashuk gel liner
that I don't love but I have nothing
else right now so I'm just trying to use
it as much as I can it's just I don't
know it's it transfers to my lower lash
line when I wear it on my upper one so I
just don't love it
got some eyedrops some brow tweezers
tweezers and scissors lash curler from
Sephora sharpener and then this is
actually it came with my simplehuman
mirror that I can just wipe it down when
there's when it's looking all smudgy and
that is pretty much everything so
hopefully you enjoyed this video and I
will link my entire playlist of all of
my everyday makeup drawer videos below I
love filming these and as I said I've
been doing them for a long time so I
have a lot and it's kind of fun to go
back and watch some old ones because I
see like oh wow I remember when I was
trying that out again or trying for the
first time and I realized it became a
Holy Grail or I realized oh it's
terrible and I got rid of it you know
it's just kind of cool to see how my
collection and my tastes have changed
over the years anyway other than that I
hope that you'll subscribe to catch more
of my videos and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
