another installment of my everyday
makeup drawer one of my favorite videos
to film I try and do it once a month but
sometimes it's more often sometimes it's
not as often but I want to try and make
sure that I'm doing it once a month
because I'm certainly switching it up
that often but basically these videos
are just where I show you into my drawer
that I use to put all of my kind of
everyday makeup in so either products
I'm loving or I have been loving for a
long time or products I'm trying to make
sure that I'm seeing every day and use
that I'm gonna try out or just products
that I feel like I've kind of forgotten
about and I want to give them some more
love you know if you make videos on
YouTube or if you just have a large
collection products go bad after a while
and if you're not using them they're
just gonna go bad without you getting to
use them so this is my way of making
sure that I'm kind of constantly
rotating what I'm using and that's not
to say I don't peek into other drawers
and grab things out but this is my way
of making sure that I have a place where
I can really make sure that I see
products every single day so without
further ado here we go so this is a look
at my everyday makeup drawer currently
it's set up pretty much the same it's a
little fuller than it usually is because
I'm trying out a lot of new products
because I want to do some reviews
especially on some Mary Kay products and
things like that so that's why you're
gonna see a lot of Mary Kay in here so
let's go ahead and start with the
containers that I use this first one
right here is from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and
it was only a couple dollars I just love
it they're really well made and it's
actually my favorite kind of acrylic
ones and then I also have this big one
which is three small compartments the
main one and then two like medium ones
it's all one piece it was only like five
dollars at Target I think in the closet
organization section so this is
definitely a good one if you have the
alux drawers this doesn't actually sit
on the bottom it actually floats a
little bit above it but not enough that
it would bother you at all in fact I
never really even noticed that it
doesn't quite touch the bottom but it
sets along the edges really well so
those are the containers and then I also
have one back here that's full of just
kind of like random skincare and stuff
that I'm not really using it's just
there that I got from the Dollar Tree
alright so let's go ahead and dig in
so in this front compartment this is
actually where I just keep products
I'm wanting to try out so for example
I've got my cheek room makeup base a lot
of things that I got in beauty boxes
this month things I got in my boxycharm
like my Tarte blushing bride cheap stain
michurina Tarantino concealer just some
lip products I've got some eyeliners
I've got this off for an eyebrow pencil
I'm gonna try out a bare minerals
full-size lipstick I got from Ipsy
points and just all kinds of things
these are all new products most of these
I've already tried but I'm keeping it
here just to make sure that I try them
some more before I make a decision that
oh I hate it or oh I love you know so I
just gotta keep those together there
eventually they'll disperse into my
collection but in the meantime I keep
them crowd together stay in there buddy
over here I've just got my Trina
Tarantino dull skin cheek palette and
it's got four beautiful colors I
actually only keep this up here because
I use the mirror it's a really big
mirror and I'll turn toward the window
to double-check that my makeups not
looking cray so um this is just a great
mirror to just pick up and have on hand
I love the blushes too but I find that
I'm using the mirror more than the
blushes but it's a great palette and
then down here I've got my L'Oreal true
me true me looming foundation I like to
wear in the summer it's a much darker
shade than I would usually wear I have
it in w12 so it's a little darker than
my normal skin tone but it works in the
summertime so that's why I'm using that
right now in this section over here I
just keep like eyeshadow so I'm using
right now this is the NYX single
eyeshadow and SOS and it's just this
beautiful taupe shade that I can't stop
using in my crease I literally use it
every single day I can't stop using it
and then I've also got this color tattoo
pigment in barely brazen and it's a
totally a dupe for see like it and it's
just gorgeous and then I also have the
Sarina Tarantino duo in Jasper and a got
a and these colors are so so pretty I
got it on HauteLook for really cheap hmm
I love that and then here I've got my
mary kay setting spray that i'm trying
out that's by Scandinavia which I
thought was pretty cool
a starlooks liner in exit to Eden that I
got into Starbucks that I literally
can't stop using it's just this gorgeous
green liner it's so pretty on the lower
lash line
oh and then I'm using at my Urban Decay
Velvet liner that came and I don't know
what but I love it
I've got my Mary Kay ultimate mascara
that I'm trying out and I think I'm
liking it so far it's not my favorite
favorite mascara but it's not terrible
and I'm glad for that because I can be
really picky with mascaras and then I've
also got this scandalised thick and
thinner thick and thin eyeliner from
Rimmel it's kind of got an interesting
it's kind of chiseled but it's really
thin still it's just interesting it's
not the blackest you can kind of see
it's really not the blackest thing in
the universe but I figure I'll use it up
so that's all that I've gotten here over
here I've got some blushes that I'm
using right now my NYX cream blush which
I just mentioned in my summer essentials
video I love it's in boho chic it's just
a really really pretty color and then
I've also got my Maybelline master
highlight my face to do this is the one
in pink rose and it's just this gorgeous
mosaic but it ends up being so beautiful
and shimmery it's just this gorgeous
light pink color it's got kind of a
shimmer too it's just so pretty I can't
stop using that either I've had it for
months too
I've also got my bare minerals concealer
and well rested that I just adore and
then I've also got my starlooks gel
liner it was when Ashley Hackman had
like her own box I guess here on YouTube
and I love it it's in the shade black
hole which is just that black so back
here in this compartment I have a ton of
Mary Kay products so I've got this these
eyeshadows that are if I can get it open
that my friend sent me that's the Mary
Kay representative I'll put her info
below just three beautiful shadows I'm
trying out for my Mary Kay review mary
kay lip balm you know this is the eye
primer that's like freaking glue like
you put it on and no shadow is coming
off and then I've also got for cream
shadows from Mary Kay that I'm trying
out so those are all kind of together
there so I can use them here I've got
this is a new purchase for me the Mac
mineralize skinfinish natural and I got
it in medium I bought it at a CCO and
they didn't have anything lighter and I
was like you know what it actually works
for my skin in the summer so it hasn't
been an issue and it's gorgeous
and then I also got my laura geller
what's it actually called balance and
bronze foundation and bronzer and fair
so it's got the powder foundation and
the bronzer and it just works really
pretty on your cheeks like I've been
using just this instead of blush on my
cheeks and then that is kind of like a
highlight shade and it's just beautiful
and it's great for travel because it has
both of those in it together
and I also have my hoola bronzer back
here just in case I want to grab it over
here I've got just my contact case my
ELF eye makeup remover I use every
single day my Anastasia brow pencil that
the brow wiz that I love and then I'm
trying out the essence lash and brow
clear gel and I've also got my EOS
Sweetman that you guys know I love and
then back here is just a star looks what
do they actually call it doesn't have
the name it's like a shimmering powder
and it's really pretty but I can only
use it like when you're going out you
know it's a little too shimmery for this
but it's pretty and again a new product
I'm trying to try out so that is
everything that's in my drawer for right
now so hopefully that was helpful for
you guys I know these are fun for me to
make and I know a lot of you guys
requests that I do more of these more
often so I will if you enjoyed please
subscribe and I'll catch you guys soon
