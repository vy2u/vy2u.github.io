currently and I've actually switched
sides it was on my right side but now
it's on my left just because I don't
know I'm reorganizing my collection and
decluttering it right now and if you
haven't checked out my declutter videos
you I can link them below I've got a
whole series going on right now where
I'm getting rid of a lot but I'm also
getting a lot of new ones to review
because there's just so much new so many
new drugstore products out there right
now that some are amazing and some are
terrible so I'm in the midst of
reviewing a lot of these so you're gonna
see a lot of new products in here which
is exciting
so let's go ahead and dig in and I'll
show you exactly what is in here right
now the container by the way that it
this is in is one just from the target I
think it's the closet organization
section that they sell these in there's
only like five or six bucks and it's all
one piece and then I have another one
back here that is just from the dollar
store that I'm keeping a lot of
foundations and BB creams in right now
okay so starting here I've got a lot of
lip products this is one from flower
Beauty I just purchased and it's in the
shade pink about me Oh like think about
me pink about me and honestly I bought
it cuz the packaging was so cute isn't
that shallow but it's so pretty it's
actually a really opaque color which I
really really like and I also just
recently bought this Revlon matte balm
and it's in the shade sultry and it's
just this really pretty color I mean it
looks just like the packaging it's
really pretty and for some reason this
is the first matte one I've bought I
think I might have had one in the past
but I don't know what happened to it so
this is like the only matte one from
this line that I own right now I also to
colour-pop lippie stix from the well
obviously from colour-pop this is LBB
and this is Lumiere that I have a review
it's either up or it's gonna be up soon
I've already filmed it where I show
swatches of this shown on my lips etc so
I've got those in there cuz I'm trying
them out I also just got this hard candy
plumping serum volumizing lip gloss and
it's in the shade girl-next-door and
it's honestly it's pretty sheer but I've
only tried it once I'm excited to give
it a trial a few more times cuz I think
the packaging is really cute too
reminds me of the buxom blacas and I
also have two new lip liners in here
this was in my boxy tremor if see its
beauty for real lip liner and she's like
natural shade and then I also just got
this Milani lip liner in spice that I've
heard cannot remember who mentioned it
but someone just recently mentioned in a
video that it's one of their all-time
favorites and I never tried it so I it's
it's really nice it looks just like this
color which is great so those are kind
of my lip products for right now over
here I've got my drug my job star I wish
I had my own drugstore this is my
l'oreal voluminous mascara that you guys
know it's just my favorite of all time I
always end up repurchasing it so that's
what I've got there this is the brow gel
I'm using the NYX control-freak gel this
is the Maybelline fit me concealer that
I am working on a review for right now
and this is the star looks liquid liner
that I've been using forever it has not
dried out at all it is amazing oh my
gosh it came in a star box up here I've
got my wet wild comfort zone palette
which I love
oh my gosh it is amazing and then I've
got sorry I'm in a crazy mood as usual
I've got my star looks gel liner it's
almost gone but I'm using it up till
it's completely gone but it's really
good and then this is one that I loved
for a long time and then kind of forgot
about the elf eye brightener in buff and
it's amazing at brightening the under
eye I usually use it to set my concealer
I don't really use a lone I just use it
over concealer it is amazing I can't
stop using it then I got this Mirabella
primer in a subscription box and it's
awesome and I was saying in the video
where I unbox it that I'm excited to
travel with it because most primers are
in really bulky packaging and this is
really not and it's still a full size so
and it's just good a good primer and my
favorite Anastasia brow Wiz in whatever
color medium brown I'm trying to sing
honest Agia because I don't really know
how it's said so I'm just gonna stay in
the stage' because I always feel so
silly saying Anastasia so I'm going to
say it the way I want to say it then
I've got two primers this is the wet and
wild take on the day one from Fergie and
then I swear to you this is totally a
dupe for the Too Faced shadow insurance
so I've got both because I'm kind of
trying them out to see if they truly are
dupes I might do a video
I love them both and then I've got the
liner I'm using which I need to sharpen
the Jordana 12 hour made to last which
is an awesome black liner any other
color liners are amazing back here I've
got a few things that I'm that are new
ELF sent me a bunch of they're baked
baked eyeshadow trios and this is really
the only one I felt like using it's in
the shade peach please and it's just
gorgeous
all three of those colors it is an
amazing look together and you can use
them wet or dry so out of the four they
sent me this is the one I'm trying and
then this is just one I use everyday
it's the be a bombshell I shadow and
birthday suit which is just this light
tan color that's Matt that's great for
blending your whole eye shadow look
together then I've got two paint pots
and actually I'm thinking about this
kind of I didn't like go through my
collection and pick these out this is
just kind of what's in here right now I
didn't really like reorganize so I might
end up taking these out because I want
to use my ELF ones a little more so but
regardless right now I've got room
Annette rubenesque and bear study in
here because I like using those as bases
for eye looks then I've also got the
Laura Geller balance and Brighton
Foundation and fair which I've been
using kind of in place of a highlight
right now because it brightens the area
but it's not shimmery at all and it also
provides coverage so it's kind of a
win-win so this has been in my
collection a while but as I've been
decluttering I rediscovered it and it's
amazing so I'm so glad that I have
pulled that back out then I've got my
four color pop shadows that I've been
trying that I just filled a video on if
it's up I'll link it below if it's not
wait for it cuz it's coming up soon
where I do a whole look with all four of
these this is sequin I heart this you
think I'd remember these by now
girl crush is like a matte taupe and
then there is hustle which is like a
kind of a deep cranberry color so those
are pretty darn cool I have to admit but
I'll show you guys the video on that
soon and then back here are I usually
only have one or two foundations in here
but I have the separate thing now
because I'm trying out a lot I've been
reviewing a lot more on my channel I
heard your cries so I'm trying out a lot
so this I've already reviewed it's the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte I finally
you guys got it in the right shade 102
is way closer than 103 was too much I
should have
known whatever so I finally have it in
the right shade and I was able to return
the other one so yay so definitely check
that review out that foundation is
amazing and I show you how I apply it on
there too so you can see how it looks on
skin this I just recently got from
Birchbox I had some like Birchbox points
I could spend and then I also had to pay
you know whatever over but it's kind of
a birthday gift to myself this is the
dark dr. jart BB beauty balm and it's
got SPF 45 and so far it is amazing and
it's got a pump which is also amazing
then I am doing a video like putting
these head-to-head the NYC BB cream in
sip matte and then the elf BB cream
because they're both close in price so I
can't wait for you guys to see this
video it might already I don't know I'm
just so excited about I want to put it
up right now
then there's the fit me matte and
poreless which is also really good so
I'm trying out a lot I know but that is
part of my job right so that's what all
is in there I'm going to show you one
other drawer in my collection real fast
because I've kind of switched some
things around I want to share with you
stores the top one on my right side
which is where I used to keep my
everyday makeup but now I've kind of
separated my makeup that I'm using from
my skincare because it's this is kind of
always the same and it always takes up a
lot of room in there and now that I have
the bigger Alex drawer set as well I
have more rooms so I can spread out so I
figured I would keep that separate and
then this is kind of pretty much always
the same like I've always got my day and
night moisturizer or whatever it is at
the time in there and then like whatever
my serum is that I'm using lip balm I
make a remover zit zapper you know
everything I cream tweezers sharpener so
all my kind of no-nonsense products that
used to take up a lot of room in my
everyday makeup drawer now can kind of
live on their own and then I'm also this
is kind of my overflow of new products
and I know not all of these are brand
new well no yeah they are I would like
to say they're not but these are things
that I'm working on reviews for again
but I didn't need necessarily all these
lip products over there so I figured
these you know if I've already tested
them out enough that I'm ready to do a
review I could have over here things
like that some of them I've already
reviewed like the review of these Fergie
ones is already
so really I might move these from here
to my actual lip drawer anyway and then
over here I was telling you the elf sent
me some these are the other trios that
I'll probably try out but I just haven't
had the desire yet there's like a blue
and gray a purple and then like one
that's kind of similar to the one I am
trying so that's brown bonanza
smokey see and lavender love and then
this is another one I filmed my first
impression saw that you guys are gonna
laugh about
it's the kaplan d perfect pout they sent
this to me and I was so skeptical
because it's supposed to like make your
lips bigger and it the process is
hilarious and I can't wait to you see
this video because I it is like I can't
even watch it without laughing so very
excited to put this up it's an
interesting product just you'll see in
the video that's all I'll say you'll see
and then I just have like my alcohol to
spot clean brushes and then my just a
little headband to hold my hair back
while I'm doing my makeup in the morning
especially if my hair is wet and I'm
trying to keep it out of my face
so that's kind of what this Shore is all
about so I it's kind of like I've got to
everyday makeup drawers but really it's
not but kind of you guys aren't saying
it doesn't matter so let me know if
you'll be interested in future everyday
makeup drawers to see both drawers each
time this I guess this would change I
guess this would in general change a
little bit cuz these won't always be new
so we'll see but let me know what you
think down below about my kind of new
setup if you enjoyed I can link my
entire everyday makeup your playlist
below I've got a lot of these and I've
loved I just love this series because it
helps me keep my collection and check
and make sure that I'm using everything
but it also helps me see the new
products that I wanted to try keep them
right in front of my face each day so I
remember to use them and try them so if
you enjoyed please subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next one bye
it's one of those like um
like what do they call it like the
coconut infused or I don't know it's
nice it's okay it is not my favorite
it's not as good as the sweet mint so
this is gonna be a maybe as well this is
gonna be a big video of maybes until the
end when I decide this one is this Pixy
tinted bomb there's literally not really
a tent at all to it I mean truly I don't
know it might like adjustment is on your
lips packaging is cute which is why I
want to keep it however I never use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
