have my everyday makeup drawer video i
feel like i haven't done one of these in
so long like so long and i started these
back two years ago when i started my
channel when i had the idea and i'm so
excited to see a lot of youtubers that i
love are starting to do it here on
youtube obviously you're on youtube if
they're youtubers anyway so hopefully
this is enjoyable for you if you don't
know what never do makeup door is it's
basically I mean it's exactly what it
sounds like it's just a drawer that I
use to kind of put products that either
I feel like as I go through my
collection I'm like oh my gosh I forgot
about this and I want to use it again I
basically put products there that I need
in front of my face so that I use up
because maybe I'm trying to finish them
or the ones that I use every single day
without fail so I would be searching for
them every day so I just put them there
or their new products that I'm trying
out to maybe review whatever so that's
what's in there let's go ahead and see
what's in there okay so here is my
everyday makeup drawer right now I've
just got this target container i got for
like six bucks it's got all of these
compartments in it and then back there
I've got some pallets which you'll see
in a second so let's start over here
it's kind of all mixed in so the first
thing I have is this everyday minerals
concealer in multitasking and it's just
a really nice brightening powder i got
from vitacost i also have this pixie
quad that i cannot stop using i got it
from hautelook for like five bucks it's
in shades of taupe and it's just got
these gorgeous colors they blend so
seamlessly together and it's such a
perfect everyday semi shimmery look I
love it this I picked up from walgreens
the other day it's from it's from ELF
it's one of their smudge pots and it's
in the shade let it go and it's you know
it was like three or four bucks I it's
just a pretty like light pink color it's
not as good formula wise as their
regular smudge pots but honestly I just
bought it cuz Elsa so I also i'm trying
out the essence gel liner in Midnight in
Paris I got this on at Ulta for like
three or four bucks I really like it
i've heard very mixed things some people
love this and some people hate it but i
love it so much I think it's really
creamy and it stays on all day I love it
is what I was wearing on my lips in the
beginning in the end of this video which
is the NYX butter lipstick in hunk and
it looks really really deep but it's
actually more pink as you saw my lips so
I really like it I will say though you
need a lip liner with this the next
thing is this this was a free sample
with a Sephora order it's the tart the
sculptor kind of like contouring stick
and it's in the shade park ave princess
and it's really nice I will say it pulls
a little Oringer than you would like if
you're as fair as I am or for contouring
really but it's nice and it stays put
when I use it so I'm still kind of
trying it out this is the cella ivory
lace highlighter and again I got this on
hautelook and it's just a really really
light nice under brow highlighting thing
so it just makes your brows and out a
little bit more um here I've got my
Revlon Colorstay whipped my favorite
foundation of all time forever and ever
I'll probably wear this on my wedding
it's in the shade 150 buff I hate that
it's in a jar but it's fantastic
fantastic fantastic this is the NYC
smooth skin translucent lose face powder
and I actually took off the little
sifter there and it's great it's a lot
less messy when it's just open because
you can tap it off in the lid whatever
you dip your brush into it's awesome and
it's like three bucks I am falling in
love with this stuff more and more over
here I've got my NYX matte finish
setting spray that I'm trying out I
really really like because most setting
sprays make me shiny and this one
doesn't I also have another Nix this is
a control freak clear eyebrow gel it's
really good it's got a normal-size fully
so it's a little bit large but it's
great it hold on to it doesn't have too
much liquid that comes out i also have a
few elf products this is their elephant
N Sync eyeliner you see it's starting to
wear off because I've been using it like
crazy it's just a giant felt-tipped
liner pen if you will and it's great I
really really like it and then I also
have the elf makeup remover because i
always use this every day to clean up my
liner and then i have
since I love extreme or our heart
extreme volumizing mascara and this has
a giant brush but it's pretty good i
like it so far i think it needs to dry
out a little bit more before it's really
really effective but it's really really
cheap all right over here I've got my it
cosmetics bye bye under eye which I
talked about in my hall that this is one
of my favorite favorite favorite
products of theirs it's a it's a
concealer that just doesn't move all day
it's so nice this is my Anastasia brow
Wiz and medium brown that I use every
single day that I love the physicians
formula this is another liquid liner
that I used to love and this is an ultra
black but it's coming out so much more
gray than it used to so I don't know
this is a newer one maybe it needs to
dry out a bit more but I thought ultra
black was the one that was really black
but I don't know I'm not loving it as
much as I used to this is a Jordana
12-hour made to last pencil in black
that's almost used up so i'm using it
out this is another cosmetics one that i
would pay hundreds of dollars for it is
so amazing it's their tight line mascara
and I talked about it a little more too
in depth in that video but it's this
like tiny tiny like dumb tiny wand and
it is just so precise for your lower
lashes it's waterproof again I'm
probably going to use this for my
wedding I have to use a mascara on top
of it but this is amazing for really
filling in your tight line without
having to use a liner it's so good and
then I also have the hard candy glama
flage because i have a burn on my face
right now for my curling wand so this is
what i use to cover and it does amazing
so love that for facial things but i
don't love it under the eye i would
rather use this sin ti alright moving on
so back here I've got this hard candy
highlighter intiki and it is the most
amazing highlighter how do you open it
worse it is just so beautiful and glowy
and kind of golden but not to golden
because you guys know I'm really fair
and golden highlighters look ridiculous
but this one doesn't it's just a really
pretty highlight I love it and then I
also have another hard candy blush it's
one of their ombre blushes and punch and
this has become a favorite of mine
because it's got kind of a highlighter
and blush built in so you could apply it
like all in one sweet
supposedly I don't think you really can
I think it looks ridiculous but when you
blend it together it is the prettiest
shimmery light pink color so if you're
fair like I am it ends up looking it
doesn't even show up and swatches it
ends up looking gorgeous with the brush
and i also have a NYX HD blush in taupe
that so many of you guys recommended and
so I finally picked it up and it is
amazing it looks insanely dark but it
looks so amazing as a contour I love it
and it's so cheap and then I've also got
a miniature little revo Holly eats
lipstick here on YouTube who I love she
talks about revo so much and loves them
and I saw these at the dollar tree these
miniature once so I was like duh so I've
been using it I honestly I've had a week
and I've like almost used it up it's so
good then I've got some lip products
here so this is a NARS one this is the
very first NARS audacious lipstick I've
ever bought and it's in the shade and
nita I know everyone loves Anna but i
really liked anita because it was more
of a I don't know it was just had a
little bit deeper tones but not too much
I love it it's so creamy I haven't
really gotten the chance to use this
much and it was quite a splurge for me
but I just had been wanting to try one
of them and I wanted a color that i knew
i would love I might wear this on my
wedding we will see then I've also got
this it cosmetics vitality lip flush and
jenessa quoi and it's like a clear
lipstick but it goes on in kind of like
melds with your skin with your lips and
it's like this really pretty pink it
makes your lips look like that you just
bit them and so amazing and then this
Too Faced one a nude beach that I got in
a kit it's a really pretty I wear this
all the time it's so pretty just a
pretty peachy nude but it's not too dark
I love it then back here I've got an
everyday minerals cheek which I bought
on vitacost it's a blush in Primrose and
it's like a loose blush it's really
really pretty i show swatches in my
vitacost haul video of this it's kind of
hard to swatch since it's loose and then
this I this is a rediscovered one from
my collection this is the elf contouring
blush and bronzing cream and it's in the
shade st. Lucia and it you guys this
cream like it's um this is what I use
for my contour today actually
this cream both of them do not move all
day I have never had a cream product
that is so long lasting in my life I in
my life and they blend so beautifully
together and this even works like to
bronze up your entire face if you're
wanting to use cream bronzer this is the
best I've ever tried in my life way
better than the tart wanted about the
same shade too so I highly recommend
this and it's like three dollars now
back here I've just got two pallets I've
got this Too Faced ala mode 1 it was on
sale on to face website for like 18
bucks instead of 36 and I was like oh I
got it and since I that I are going to
France for our honeymoon I was like well
these are just so classic so and they
all have French name so I'm excited to
give this some more love I've had it now
for a week or two and I haven't really
used at a time but I really like this
row of colors right here so want to play
with that's more and then one of my
favorite favorites the natural eyes I've
already did my review in comparison of
this compared to a the two faced natural
eyes palette not that one I just showed
you but a different one and the two face
ones $36 this one is 8 and I swear to
you this one might be better it is so
amazing that a few of the shades are a
little different but in that video you
see swatches comparing them and i'll
link it below i love this guy so much
i've been using it a lot and that is
everything in my drawer this month if
you found that video enjoyable please
check out my my whole playlist of
everyday makeup drawers my whole series
i have in a playlist i will definitely
link that below i love watching these
it's fun to see what people are using
right then in there especially if it's
someone that you really trust and that
you um that you just really like and you
trust their opinion that's how i feel
about those that have started doing it
I'm like yes because I finally get to
see the makeup that they genuinely love
and that they're actually using right
now and I think when you've got a
collection that has grown so much you
start to feel overwhelmed and if you do
have a bigger collection you know it's
very overwhelming and I've decluttered
and I have that whole series too but it
can be very overwhelming so it's nice to
kind of to see what other people are
using but also to make yourself think
okay what am I truly using it helps you
helps you see what you can get rid of
really easily because if I have
something in my everyday makeup drawer
for the whole month or maybe even longer
and I know that I
used it once and it was right in front
of my face and I still don't want to use
it that's a pretty good sign that I
should probably get rid of it or pass it
on to someone that will love it etc so
it's a great way to help yourself
declutter to hopefully that was
enjoyable subscribe if you'd like to
catch more of my videos and I'll catch
you guys in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
