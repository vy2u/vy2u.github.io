gonna share with you guys my everyday
makeup drawer when I started this series
long long ago it was actually a drawer
and I kind of go back and forth but
right now I'm using this piece right
back here you might be able to see it
I'm going to close up on it obviously in
a second that I bought on HauteLook I am
sure I buy all of my organizers on
HauteLook which I can link below but um
I bought it recently and I've been using
and I kind of like it I switch I come
forth I don't like having a lot on my
desk it kind of drives me drives me nuts
but at the same time it's nice to be
able to just pull it and it's all right
there so this month it's in there next
month it might be back in a drawer might
still be in there we'll see I might go
back and forth cuz I can never make up
my mind but let's go ahead and get into
the makeup that I'll be trying out using
up etc this month so this is the
container I'm storing everything in I
will link the website below that I
bought this from it's not going to be
available all the time on there because
it's a flash sale site but if you keep
checking back it usually appears like
once every few weeks I would say and
they have a lot of other good acrylic
pieces but this is like a really thick
acrylic it's really nice everything is
like stationary except for this is the
only thing that moves in here it's just
like a little 3:3 slot organizer but the
rest like this whole back thing is open
this is open this is a little part that
doesn't move and then this area is open
and then there's like a little chunk
there hopefully that made sense I don't
know if it did but let's go ahead and
get into what I'm trying out this month
so the first thing is this hourglass
strobing powder and euphoric strobe
light and this one is just a really
pretty I'm actually wearing it today
like at the beginning of the video just
a really pretty really glittery
highlighter I didn't like it at first
but it's kind of grown on me so I mean
it is what it is it's not my favorite
but the more I use it the more I like it
I feel like this has to be a highlighter
though that I wear at night like if I
wear it to work I feel like in regular
lighting it looks crazy I'm also using
the what and why
ombre blush in the princess daiquiris
it's just this gorgeous like pinkish
peach and it's got a little bit of
shimmer you don't have to have a
highlighter with it which I really love
and it's just absolutely beautiful let
me show you a swatch isn't that gorgeous
some people complain about this and say
that they don't feel like it's very
pigmented but on my skin tone it shows
up on some that are deeper I could see
where it doesn't show up as well so just
be aware of that back here I have three
Sonia Kashuk quads that I recently
hauled in the drugstore haul I have I
have shimmering sands rock fair and
square and then bronze beauty and
they're all pretty they all have like a
really glittery shade in them but they
have so much fallout even just the
regular shimmery ones have so much
fallout that every time I worn it I've
like regretted wearing it so I'm still
not sure how I feel about them kind of
sad cuz they're not that cheap for
drugstore quads so over here I actually
bought this on birch box's website it's
a cargo full-size blush in Bali and when
I saw it on the website it looked just
like a really pretty everyday pink but
when you actually swatch it has like
this blue shimmer twist to it it's kind
of interesting it's of course not
swatching well but it looks beautiful on
the cheeks they say it's like a
swimmable so it's like waterproof I
don't know how true that is yet but I
will have to let you know I don't know I
don't know that I would swim in it but
you know who knows over here I have a
benefit they're real tinted primer it's
the tinted like brown primer it has the
same brush as the benefit they're real
mascara but it's just meant to go on
beforehand I've used a Fraggle week I
like it I don't know that it's really
making that much of a difference with my
lashes but I'm gonna keep trying it this
I just opened this week it's the boots
number 7 stay perfect long lasting
volume mascara and this one has a really
really thin brush which I actually don't
mind because I feel like I can really
get my lower lash as well and my upper
lashes and it seems to hold a curl
pretty well but again I've only used it
for a couple days I scooch it up a
little bit right
here this is the maybelline superstay
better skin and I have fallen in love
with this concealer it's I have it in
number 10 and it's just a really simple
doe foot concealer but it just seems to
stay put dude does it cover like the
darkest of circles no but is it really
comfortable to wear for every day yes I
think this might be the concealer I
bring with me on my cruise because I
feel like it's just so comfortable and
even when I'm sweaty it's just gonna
kind of stay where it is but not look
cakey speaking of really thick
concealers this is the it cosmetics bye
bye under-eye illumination I just got
this from it cosmetics in the mail
recently I've only tried it once and I
didn't love it but again that was one
time so I want to try it a couple times
the reckon there bye-bye
under-eye is really good the
illumination I'm not really seeing the
difference so I'm just I'm just curious
so I need to try this some more I love
the light pink packaging though here I
have two eyeliners this is the Urban
Decay 24/7 glide on pencil and zero that
I've been using for like months it'll
never die it's really good I don't want
it to die but it's just crazy how long
it's lasted and then my favorite the
Stila stay all day waterproof liquid
eyeliner which I have used for like ever
it does not budge it's got a really thin
tip it's so easy to do a winged winged
liner I literally travel with it use it
every day like never stray for my brows
I'm using my favorite the Maybelline
brow satin which is also called the
define and fill I used it today it's got
a pencil on one side and then on the
other side it's got a sponge that dips
into powder in there and it's just the
perfect thing I just wish you have like
one more arm that has like a spoolie on
it I also have the boots number seven
lash and brow
Perfector eyebrow gel it's okay it
doesn't really hold my brows in place
perfectly and it's really a wet formula
but I love the brush on it because it's
really really small so you can be really
precise you can see where it's already
getting brown and I also have this Mac
Pro Longwear lip liner and stonkingly
stylish which is a perfect like nude
peachy Brown where it's not too Brown
it's not too nude it's literally just
right I love this color in the formula
of the Pro Longwear one is so much
better than the regular
formula subscriber named Sam sent this
to me in my Canadian makeup Hall and it
is amazing so back here I have the pixi
by petra hydrating milky mist that I
just got in my like unboxing video I've
only used it like once or twice it's
just a really nice miss to throw some
moisture on your face that's how I've
been using it and I just like it for
that I also have this new BB cream that
I'm trying
I love the dr. jart gold label like BB
cream that's in a gold container that
looks just like this but this is the
Black Label detox so far the only
difference I've seen this one has SPF of
25 the other has SPF of 45 but in the
formula I'm not seeing a difference
which is not the worst thing because I
really like the original formula I just
wanted to try another one so really
liking the Hat then I love that it's got
a pump applicator on the other side and
the packaging is actually really well
made the foundation I'm using when I
want a little more coverage is the boots
number 7 lift and luminate foundation
this again has a really nice pump and I
just love this stuff I've been mixing it
with this Mac strobe cream here and it
is just the most beautiful effect I love
it if you're curious I wear the shade
warm ivory in this so here I've got the
pixie book of beauty in minimal makeup
and it's just got like some contour
shade or contour shade of blush some
highlights and then some eye shadows I
really liked the blush and contour or
bronzer whatever it would be for you I
really like those the rest I haven't
played with a ton but then behind it is
my favorite my Sephora Z palette it's
got about I would say to I would say
most of this is a mix between Mac and
Carrie D shadows from my duke video I
picked my favourites of them so some of
them I kept the Mac a lot of them I kept
the carroty ones and some of these are
actually makeup geek as well so they're
just my favorite favorite ones I will
link this V palette below because it is
the perfect size it's like not huge
because I have a really big one and it's
not too small it's just perfect so I'll
link this below if you're curious it was
only like 10 bucks I also pulled this
baby out I haven't used it in so long
this is the Laura
Ella palette nude one and I loved this
if you saw my old video where I talked
about the comparison of this versus the
second palette they had I love this
palette and I forgot how much I did so I
want to use this some more and then the
primer I'm using right now is the
Maybelline master prime in the blur and
illuminate 200 I love this if you've got
dry skin you will love this primer and
then the serum that I am obsessed with
is the Paula's Choice resist super
antioxidant concentrate serum I've been
using this for so long it has completely
transformed my skin I love it then up
here I already showed the Mac strobe
cream and then I also have the the Mac
lustre drops a lot of these are from my
Canadian subscriber that's that this is
in the shade pink rebel and it's just a
gorgeous liquid highlight if you put a
little bit on your hand and then put a
little stippling brush on it and then
stipple it onto your cheekbones it looks
gorgeous she also sent this quo blush in
the shade pinch and it's this perfect
like peachy pink color it's got shimmer
where you don't really need a highlight
with it but it's not glitter so it
doesn't have a weird fallout it doesn't
look weird and splotchy throughout the
day it's just perfect and then she also
sent this Vasanti highlighter in golden
child it's like a highlight duo and I
love this when you swirl them together
it's the prettiest golden highlight oh
my gosh I know it's not really doing it
justice here because I am like so pasty
right now but I'm always pasty Who am I
talking about down here I have my holy
grail it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination powder
foundation that was ridiculous in light
it's a very high coverage powder
foundation but it's got like this
illuminating quality where when you put
it on your skin it doesn't make you look
it makes you look matte and it looks
like there's higher coverage but but it
has this quality where it makes your
skin look like it's still glowy as well
it is the most amazing thing I literally
wear it every day I can't believe I
haven't run out of it yet I'm also
trying to use up the Kevin of Kwan
sculpting powder and medium and by use
up I mean I don't want it to run out but
I've already bought a second one so
I'm you know what you hit pan all right
like I'm ready for my new one that's
kind of where I'm at so I love this it's
the perfect contour shade for my skin
tone it's great tone just enough I love
it
then I've got the Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre and it's just like a yellow toned
primer for me I also have painterly but
I like stocked over ochre a little
better I also have my favorite gel
eyeliner subscribers sent me this
because she had one and she wasn't going
to use it it's the mica or mica beauty
gel liner in black I love this stuff it
just does not move oh my gosh I just
love it I also have this ardency in
eyeshadow in Sunday and it's this
gorgeous light gold color I've heard
really good things about this I've tried
it I mean it's really pretty but it's no
better than like other shadows I've had
so I feel like I need to try another
shade to see what the fuss is about
I like it but it's kind of expensive for
what it was to be honest I also
repurchased the wet-and-wild single
shadow in brulee this is the best when
it comes to a light eyeshadow it's
perfect front of your brow bone it's
perfect to blend shadows together I mean
it is just perfect and so so cheap so
pigmented I also got the Josie Maran
coconut watercolor cheek gelee I bought
it on HauteLook and it's an island pink
I thought I wouldn't like it I was
actually impressed when you actually
stipple it on it comes across as more of
like a pink and it's just different I
was impressed and it actually stayed on
I need to use this some more which is
why it's in here lip products I have
here are kind of just light one since
we're going into spring this is like the
l'oreal extraordinaire and it's in 101
rose melody and it's just got a doe foot
applicator it's just kind of a light
nice rosy pink I think it's so beautiful
these don't last for a long time but
they're not really meant to they're just
kind of comfortable to throw on and then
I also have the Rimmel the only one
lipstick and it's in the shade 200 it's
a keeper and this one I've only worn
like once it was a little frosty err
than I had anticipated
I loved the color I love that blue tone
pink but I've only worn it like once I
need to try it a few more times but I'm
not sure that I love
and I think I've covered everything in
this for this month so hopefully this
video is enjoyable for you I will link
my playlist of all of my everyday makeup
to our videos from like two years ago to
now if you're curious about what makeup
I have try what I was trying last month
etc what I was trying to years ago which
is always fun to go back and watch a
thing oh my gosh I realized how much I
hated that or oh wow I used that up and
I loved it and I still love it and I
bought a new one I hope that you'll
subscribe to catch more of my videos
then I'll see you guys in my next one
