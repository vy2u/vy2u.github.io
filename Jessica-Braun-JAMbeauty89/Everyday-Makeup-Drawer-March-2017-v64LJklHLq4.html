I'm so excited
I feel like lost my words there I am
resurrecting my everyday makeup drawer
series I started this series a long time
ago and I feel like I keep trying to
resurrect it and then I'm like mom and I
don't know how I keep just forgetting to
film them I want to do these every
single month that's the way I used to do
it a lot of you guys found me through my
everyday makeup drawer series and I'm
sad that I'd like let that piece of my
history go
so I'm resurrecting it for real this
time I need you guys hold me accountable
each month tweet me snap me whatever and
say hey don't forget every day makeup
drawer this month so this is going to be
the one for March and I'm so excited I
don't know about this series I started
it a long time ago a lot of other
youtubers now do it and I love watching
them and people have made it their own I
mean it's so amazing but when I started
it the idea was just that it's the
drawer right in front of me or right
next to me depending on my setup at the
time but it's full of the products that
I'm trying to use now for me these are
not necessarily every single thing I
need to get ready
I still pull into my regular collection
because I like opening my primer drawer
and seeing all my primers and getting to
pick so it's not that I'm only using
these I know some people do that that
way for me it's just product I want
close at hand right there
so I room I'm reminded to use them
whether it's products I've forgotten
about new products I'm trying out or
just favorites that I know that I want
right there like my Beauty Blender I use
all the time I want it right there
things like that that I want close at
hand so I'm going to shut up without
further ado let's get into my everyday
makeup drawer for March 2017 so this is
my vanity the things that are actually
on top of it varies every select day but
it's typically at least my makeup brush
holder my plant in my little tart warmer
that I got I think from when Walmart for
like 20 bucks sometimes I'll have my
like side like a lip gloss holder
sometimes got that up there sometimes I
won't it just kind of moves around but I
do like how simplistic it is so I have
two drawers here
I bought the depth from hope book which
I can link below
they have really cheap some makeup and
furniture and stuff like that but let's
go and get into these two tours so this
is the right drawer here and I've got
these go ahead
little holders here I got from I think
The Container Store and then the dollar
store they're both exactly but in here I
usually keep mascaras I have a bunch
open at on it I have the essence last
person princess mascara so I've really
grown to like it just needed a few weeks
to dry out when it's pretty close to a
dupe for my favorite it cosmetics
superhero mascara honestly this stuff is
old and every time I quote I don't even
want to open it because every time I
close it it seeps out the side so I have
to wipe it off every single time it
drives me nuts but this mascara is so
good but I do like the last princess and
it's way way cheaper and then I also
have what I'm wearing today which is
this Clarins mascara it's their mascara
super a volume and this one also needs a
few weeks to kind of dry a house a bit
but it really is nice I really have
grown to like this so I have my mascaras
in there I have two brow products in
here my hourglass arch brow sculpting
pencil in - I use every single day love
that and then for more detailed work
this and smaller it's the Anasazi brow
wiz and medium brown honestly i use the
spoolie on this more than anything
because i love it but so that's what's
in there I also have my little elf
makeup removing move the one downside
these things get lost back here I have
my elf makeup removing pen that I love I
have like five of these on back up I
have my favorite drugstore liner it's
the Milani stay-put pencil liner I love
the packaging I have flown through this
though because I'm constantly sharpening
it but I love it
this is trying out it's new to me it's
the hourglass I mean it's the brand new
hourglass boyer waterproof liquid liner
they sent it to me recently very very
black the kind of felt tips that I
really like of course the packaging is
beautiful hourglass is packaging always
is but so I don't know how I feel about
this I'm still trying it out and then
this I got from octa Lee for free it
says Clarins filo it's a four color all
in one pen for eyes and lips so you push
it down and it's a black one and then
you can get rid of that and then they
have a brown one isn't this cool and you
can kind of raise the actual pencil as
well and they have a blue
one isn't ugly beautiful and then they
have that they say this one's more for
lips more like a new color but I thought
this was so fun so let me know if you
want to review on this I mean it really
is just kind of a fun tool I'm going to
kind of get on my knees here getting old
alright so right next to it is kind of
more like powdery tech product I just
got a bunch of Smashbox products from
HauteLook for 50% off
I mentioned it twice that I love it I
use I've used it for years it's where I
get a lot of my makeup but it's this
fusion soft life lights and it's in
baked starburst and it's just really
pretty kind of highlight I haven't
really used it yet it does have more of
a bronzey tone but it's just really
pretty so I'm excited to use that I got
it for half off so I was like why not
another things that have lived in here a
while because I'm still trying them out
these are the Revlon blushes I have rosy
rendezvous which is totally up my alley
bronze beauty which is of course more of
a bronzer and then I have orchid charm
which is a little bit darker than I
typically wear these aren't like crazy
swatch heavy but they look really
natural on the skin so I'm still kind of
liking them alright next thing is my wet
and wild
photo focused pressed powder I like this
one of the better drugstore powders I
don't use powder every day like this I
usually use loose powder but it really
is nice and it's surprisingly finely
milled I have another shade warm light
I'm also continuing to try out my
essence your nude highlighter that I
recently got some more natural
highlighter but does kind of pack a
punch there you can't really see it in
swatches but it's really pretty so I've
been loving that and then I'm also
trying out the juice beet Beauty I got
it in the subscription box the last
looks cream blush and flush it's a
really pretty natural color cream blush
I love this kind of a shade
isn't that beautiful I've only worn it
once and I really really liked it but of
course want to keep trying it out so
back here is the mary lou manizer well
it's the three different lou manizer
efficiently a bunch of products recently
all you know like a highlight blush and
bronzer but they're all really shimmery
so it you know I don't know like I could
never wear those bronzer but it's still
really really pretty so I'm trying those
out I also have my beloved hourglass
ambient lighting edit I love the
packaging I love every product in here I
use this all over the face this is more
of a highlight and then any of these for
blush and this is even kind of bronzer
II if you wanted it to be I mean it's
kind of in-between I love it sometimes
I'll just won't throw my brush through
the entire thing and put it all over my
cheeks I love this and I love the big
mirror as well
I like to travel now I have my eyelash
curler back there I have my little
blender L you can it's just a beauty
blender holder it could totally just
like stand but it also fits in there so
I like to keep it in there alright so
kind of zoomed in a little bit another
new Smashbox product for me is the LA
Life blendable lip and cheek color it's
called Hollywood and highlight I mean
obviously this is more of like a
highlight
cheek color not a lip color but I think
they have one cent or more let's base
then there's like this sponge here that
you can kind of blend it with which i
think is kind of cool actually I didn't
try to get because it's still very new
that's why it's in the shore since I got
a subscription box this has been effect
anti-aging lip treatment supposedly it
helps them get rid of vertical lines in
your lips it's just a white little bomb
here actually putting it all in lips
right now because they need it all right
it does feel crazy on the lips it goes
awesome there's not much in there though
you can tell but I'm trying that out
then I have my beloved 7ik Wan coping
powder but it's been the shade light I'm
wearing this today I absolutely love it
it's the perfect tone for lighter skin
and then I have this my luna highlighter
a lot of these were in my favorites
because well I love them it's it's
unbelievably
what color is it called Calypso again I
got a subscription boxes time because
taupey highlight it is so so pretty oh I
have my really cool currently just dunk
on the tweezer men light up little
tweezers I love these I can like find
every hair with that light and then
again another new products and smash
you'll see a few of these it's their Co
circuit I got for like 50% off so
there's the contour bronze and highlight
that they have I haven't tried it yet I
just kind of swatched it so very very
new to meet them I thought my name you
know my knees again Hart my RMS beauty
master mixer I use this as kind of more
bronzy highlight just a really pretty
you just kind of Pat it on to your skin
and it just looks so so pretty I also
have a living room and either one they
have a new like champagne like rose gold
champagne one that I want to get I'm
trying to hold back but I really want it
enjoyed it would have to look similar to
that one next things I love these are my
Milani keep it sweet lip scrub and my
keep it smooth these are the luxe lip
treatment these are incredible
incredible incredible I love this scrub
it's these they both smell like a dream
and they work really well I mean I when
I run out of these I will repurchase
them again and again next product is
this NYX eyeshadow base in white it's
just a really creamy eyeshadow base
really white does a great job of holding
on your eyeshadow but also making it
really pop I kind of switch between this
and my NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk but
I kinda really do like this then I have
my L'Oreal lacquer liner to my favorite
black gel cream type eyeliner I use
every single day I just have a bunch of
odds and ends some sharpener the little
mirror you know scissors contacts etc
and I think that is it for this short
let's move onto the next one here is my
left shore this one's got a lot of fake
products but also some lip products and
some eye products so so that really kind
of runs the game doesn't alright so
let's start over here I've got my wet
and wild photo focus foundation what
other foundations oh I've just got this
in the mail again from home this algin
is basically tinted moisturizer it
definitely does not have high coverage
because it is a sense of moisturizer but
I really I've only worn it like twice I
really do like it though it has micro
algae and a bunch of other stuff that
I'm not sure how my skin reacts to it
yet but I'm liking it so in there so
that I can try it out more
I got a bunch of new products is so many
primers and I just bought more but the
Smashbox photo-finish came in a kit with
that contour thing so excited to give
this a try I used to love this a long
time ago but I've actually it's always
been trial sizes that I had so I'm
excited to have the full size of that
and then I just bought on a whim this
nick hydra touch primer because I love
hydrating primers and it very much
reminds me of my smashbox hydrating
primer it's got a similar color to it
although i mean really is clear but it
feels really nice i haven't used it on
my face yet so i'll have to get back to
you I love how hydrating it feels next
is another new one for me the elf tone
adjusting face primer I'm curious if
this is similar to the other purple like
primers that are out there so again I'll
have to get back to you but I have worn
this on my face and it comes out like
dark purple which cracks me up but of
course it blends away but it's very I'm
softening and just I like the way it
feels my favorite my milk makeup blur
stick I love I put this all over my nose
to fill in the pores around there before
I put on foundation this scent still
trying out the hard candy
coconut water primer stick this is again
just really hydrating it's like a stick
form of like a hydrating primer like
that so I can put this just like in my
on my forehead where it's really dry and
just get some extra hydration in that
region I also have my glossy a priming
moisturizer I use this just as the
moisturizer they're not really as a
primer when I put this on once I get out
of the shower and I sit down to do my
makeup this is the first thing I put on
my face this I got through octa Lee it's
the pure no filter blurring photography
primer this is a very shot it like
dropper kind of a yellow toned cream
very illuminating not glittery but
illuminating and it's really really
pretty it has a golden tone I've only
used it just as a targeted highlighter
not just all over my face I don't know
if I'll ever use it all over my face
maybe but it is really pretty and I
think the packaging is pretty too I also
have my Milani setting spray that I love
I deserve
all day I have this Clinique pep start
eye cream that I don't really love or
hate I'm just kind of using up at my eye
cream or the daytime and then one of my
favorites the Kat Von D lock-it
concealer cream the stuff is amazing I
just filmed a video about this if it's
up I'll link it below comparing this to
the Tarte shaped cake I love the
applicator it's high coverage really
blendable really comfortable a million
shades it is awesome
I think that's everything in here I just
got these as well
well pretty recently milk sent me all of
their little I pick Minh I'm just going
to swatch a couple these are amazing I
don't have all of them in this drawer
because there's like a blue and a bright
green products that I'm not for colors
I'm really not going to wear everyday
this is the shade after party oh my gosh
this is the shade well this is like my
favorite this is gig these are so
gorgeous I have worn these on my eyes
and they are stunning and they do not
budge so amazing I'm sure I will film
some kind of review video about those so
just sit tight
alright swatches are cleaned off next I
have just some random lip products so
I've got my wet and wild gel lip liner
and never petal down I love these gel
liners I have every shade this is one I
really haven't tried much so I wanted to
try we're almost to spring so I'm got
wishful thinking so I have a nice rosy
color then I have this Stila stay all
day lip liner
what's the shade in Pinot Noir and it's
just a nice blue tone red lip liner
so I'm trying that out still I'm also
trying out the grande lips hydrating lip
plumper I don't know the shade it
doesn't say but it's just like a nice
kind of mid-tone bluish pink and then
and it's really more of a plumper and a
gloss it doesn't really have this ton of
pigment I'm also trying out the elf
tinted lip oils I really like this shade
and nude kiss it's a really simple just
comfortable on the lips and they do have
that kind of chair like applicator
Charlie next up back here I have my
Physicians Formula youthful wear powder
that I love
the illuminating finish it's got good
coverage but it makes your skin look
like alive and kind of not dewy but just
nice it doesn't matter Phi which I like
because I already have dry skin this is
the little V palette I got through
boxycharm in the box and then I just
have a bunch of different colors here
some of them aren't marked so I don't
remember where I got them isn't it
horrible this is max Brune this is
cherry cola from makeup geek at it's
beautiful prom night for makeup geek so
that soft brown from Mac don't know what
that is cork from Mac I think this is
Brule from Mac no-name I think this is
unknown into yeah so I don't know if I
don't know where I got them to be honest
but just a few that I randomly picked
out to keep in here just because I
wanted to try them on I think that's a
cool combo of colors too next again I
got this for half off on HauteLook it's
the double exposure palette I literally
only swatch since I haven't used it yet
so really pretty I remember I used to
own the original full exposure palette
and there's a lot of fallout so I'm
hoping I mean it looks like there's a
little bit of powder I'm ok with it I
can get over fallout because like my
lorac palettes do as well but you know
it's always nice when they don't have it
but these are some pretty colors
together and I also have my hard candy
palette in what is it called there look
Pro matte eyeshadow Pro palette and it
just has all of these colors all matte
really cool colors together so I've used
this a couple times and I've really
liked the looks that I have come up with
so those are just some business works so
that is everything in that drawer as
well hopefully you enjoyed this video I
love doing them if you want to watch my
old ones I have them one semi recently

entire playlist of them and other than
