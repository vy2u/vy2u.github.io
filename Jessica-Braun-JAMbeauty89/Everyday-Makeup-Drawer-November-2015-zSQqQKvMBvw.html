gonna share with you my updated everyday
makeup drawer this is a series I started
a couple years ago and it's kind of
taken fire here on YouTube or caught
fire that sounds right it's kind of
caught fire here on YouTube but a lot of
people are doing this type of video and
I love watching them so it's really
exciting for me just because I like
watching this kind of videos so for
selfish reasons I love it it's just
basically a drawer I keep since I have
tons of drawers and lots of makeup that
I go through and I'm trying out all the
time there are a lot of makeup rocks and
I forget about or there are new ones
that I need to remember to try out to
perhaps tell you guys about um so for
various reasons I like having this
drawer so that way in the morning when
I'm getting ready I can just open it and
see okay these are all a bunch of
products that I want to use for all
those different reasons I already
mentioned so I love doing this it's
really helped me kind of corral what I
have so that way I'm using everything I
have some of them are products I'm just
trying to use up things like that so if
you're interested let's go ahead and get
into it so here's my everyday makeup
drawer for the month of November I've
got mostly new stuff to be honest a lot
of things that either I've been sent or
I purchased recently that I'm trying to
try out to see if I want to review for
you guys on my channel and kind of how I
feel about them but I've also got a few
products that I've had for a while that
I want to make sure I'm using and using
up so let's zoom in a little bit okay so
right here are some lip products that I
want to use this one I just recently got
at the Milani amore matte lip cream in
the shade lust and it's just a gorgeous
I'm wearing it at the beginning of the
video actually it's just it dries down
matte but it looks really beautiful and
it's not as dry feeling as most of the
other ones I've tried so I really like
that this one I bought a while ago it's
the Revlon Super Lustrous lip gloss in
the shade sky pink and it just kind of
all kind of show it to you this one's
just kind of really I don't know it
doesn't really have a ton of color to it
but it's just a really nice gloss and I
like these because they're not super
sticky so definite
I want to make sure I'm using that got
my Rimmel exaggerate lipliner in East
End snob it's a favorite of mine it has
been for quite a while now it's just a
really simple color that goes with so
much like it is the best lip liner to
travel with because it goes with so many
things in fact I think it would work
with every single thing in this drawer
right now this is a lipstick I love it's
the NYC expert last lip color this one I
really like it's and berry me but I just
did a lip swatch video and if it's up I
will link it but these are just really
nice and they're crazy cheap so and I
really like this shade so I wanted to
kind of use this this month it seems
very appropriate for November and then I
also wanted to make sure I use this
Milani matte Beauty and this one I also
have a lip swatch video of a bunch of
these shades from this line this one's
just so different for me and I really
like it and I love the Milani matte
lipsticks they're awesome and if you've
been turned off by Milani before based
on their lipstick smell the matte ones
don't have that smell these have like a
vanilla smell so I really like these I
had to get rid of all the other Milani
ones though because they have that smell
it made me sick to my stomach so right
over here I have actually here - I've
got two blushes I'm trying to make sure
I'm using this is the makeup geek blush
and secret admirer it's a very cool tone
almost purple blush but it looks so cool
on the cheeks I love this kind of a
color and it really is almost purple but
it blends to such a beautiful almost
whimsical fairy light color I love that
and then this one I bought when I was in
Paris this past summer for my honeymoon
it's one of the boudoir I can't say that
right
it's the rose ashes of roses is the
English version and it's not these are
like the craziest most pigmented when
you swatch them but they really are
pretty on the skin so I want to make
sure I'm using that and giving it enough
love and then I'm also trying to use up
this NYX high definition blush in taupe
it's obviously not really a blush it's
more like a contour shade so hit pan on
it and getting use it up it's a little
darker than what I need but I still like
it I don't know if I'll repurchase it or
not I haven't really decided I'm still
to find great drugstore contour powders
I found a couple but this one's pretty
good okay so back here are some
concealers and primers this is one I
bought a while ago but I haven't used it
like ever so Revlon Photoready concealer
and it's just a stick concealer and it
actually feels decently creamy for some
stick concealers I feel like I've tried
in the past have not been this creamy so
feels really nice I don't like to use
two concealers under my eye but you know
for blemishes and things like that it's
great and it's gonna in my opinion this
should work better than like a liquid
one for my skin just for covering up
those blemishes so I do want to get
better at using that and then the
maybelline superstay better skin
concealer I'm still trying out I really
like it I like that it's kind of more
yellow tone this is the shade ivory I
like it it's more yellow tone it's very
kind of light it blends out really well
it stays put so I honestly I've been
pretty impressed with this so I want to
keep trying it out though to decide
exactly how I feel about it
then this one's the MU a professional
eyeshadow base I love this stuff it's
like a concealer for your eyes and it's
great because you know when you're
wanting to do a dramatic eye look or a
natural eye look you want to make sure
you've got an even under neath base you
know what I'm saying so I really like
this stuff a lot I've been using it like
every day this became a favorite and I
cannot believe I lived without it this
is the mana conditioning lash primer I
need to buy I don't know if this is a
full size or if I don't know I hope they
come in a bigger size but it's just a
simple white liquid lash primer it's not
like fibers it's like liquid it makes my
lashes look so much better every single
day under any mascara I try it with I
was so impressed I think this came in a
subscription box and I when this runs
out I will definitely be searching for
where to buy this from I like it a lot
this is something that's been forgotten
in my collection this is the Too Faced
shadow insurance Lemon Drop and I got
this on HauteLook for under $10 I think
because it's always discounted on there
all these high-end things but it's kind
of a yellowish primer and I like it I
remember really
it's just been sitting in there and I
knew I didn't want to get rid of it
because I liked it but I haven't been
using it so I definitely want to give
that some more love over here this is a
brand new purchase this is the wet and
wild by Fergie shimmer palette in
Hollywood Boulevard a lot of people here
on YouTube love this stuff it's a
gorgeous highlighter so I'm excited I've
used it a couple times I've really been
impressed excited to use that some more
it definitely has like a bronzy gold
look to it but even though I'm pretty
fair it still works with my skin tone so
you just have to make sure you kind of
use a lighter hand this is a favorite of
mine this is from it cosmetics there's
celebration foundation illumination in
light it's a powder foundation and I
just use it in my t-zone but what's
great about it is that it just leaves
like a satin look so your skin doesn't
look dry it looks perfected but like
that it like it's glowing it's I don't
know how to describe it it is the most
beautiful product it's expensive I
haven't found a drugstore version of
this yet I'm hoping I do because I want
to rebuy this but I don't you know what
I mean so but it's awesome so right over
here is this pure eye polish and I've
talked about this in a lot of videos
it's like a cream shadow but it's more
of like a liquid there's like a little
cushion there and it's just this
gorgeous kind of pinkish one what did I
say the shades in the shade satin I have
all the shades and this is my favorite
so I kept this in here I just I think
it's beautiful and really easy to use to
just throw just this on and leave and it
doesn't move all day some eyeshadow
palettes I have the Maybelline quad in
chai latte because it makes me think of
like autumn and even November so I got
this out and I want to be using it right
now because be using it I want to make
sure I'm using this right now because
it's such a beautiful quad there are
some really cool colors in this that I
really sorry that one has all the stuff
from the pure eye polish but I love this
shade here I am going all the way up my
arm it's such a cool front bronze color
it's just I think it's really pretty
okay so I'm also trying to use this mu a
professional eye shadow palette it's
their nude one
I just did a drugstore haul with this
where i swatched them all they're really
pretty it's they're really really pretty
here's two of them right there they're
more pigmented than I would have guessed
and I liked this range of shadows that
they have some matte ones and some
shimmery I think it's actually a really
good mix oh I'm so excited they're
selling these here in the United States
now I found mine at who's either CVS or
Walgreens I can't remember which one I
think it was Walter and then I also
pulled out my naked 2 palette because I
have not used this and probably I don't
even know it feels like it's been a year
these are so beautiful I'm wearing these
on my eyes right now I think I'm usually
I used a lot of snake bite today and
foxy I love and I used half baked on the
lid on top of snake bite and I used a
little bit of tease to kind of blend it
out I love this palette and I just
always forget about it so I'm so glad I
pulled this out and I want to use it I
love it this mascara I'm trying out is
from the brand do say I got it in a I
think a boxycharm
it's pretty good it's the Punk volumizer
mascara but I'm still kind of seeing how
I feel this is a makeup remover pen from
Starr looks back when I got the star
look star box it's just like the elf one
I just ran out so I'm using this now to
kind of clean up any winged liner
let me grab these little things oh this
came in a subscription box it's the ball
meet Matt Hughes it's a really pretty
liquid lipstick I want to try out some
more and then I've got this hourglass
brow sculpting pencil in the shade ash
they sent these to me a while ago and
I'm actually impressed with these I've
been using this one a lot but there's
another thing hourglass sent me that I
hated that I'm going to mention here in
a second this is really nice though so
I've been using that and then my
Anastacio clear brow gel that I love I'm
using this one up I like this one but I
also like the NYX control-freak one so I
kind of toggle between those two but I'm
gonna use this one up and then I've also
got this MUA liner I know there's a lot
of anyways because I recently bought a
lot so I'm trying it all out but this is
their gel eyeliner pencil in black and
it's really really good so super
impressed and then Lancome sent me a
bunch of their liner
trying out a lot of them are colors and
they're amazingly pigmented but you know
the drugstore has ones that are just as
good the Jordana 12-hour liners they
have bright colors and they're just as
good so I really like this and I'm gonna
use it but I'm just letting you guys
know I mean I love the drugstore and the
Jordana ones are exactly the same but
this is really good this is the Lancome
it's in the shade Chloe I think and it's
just this gorgeous light gray I love
using this like a dark grey love using
now my lower lash line oh my gosh it
really is I love this shape back here
this is the hourglass product I was
telling you guys about they just sent me
these these are the Immaculate liquid
powder foundation
it's mattifying and oil-free they sent
me two shades I tried nude and it was
too dark I was like whoa this is like
orange so I wiped it off this is today I
mean I'm literally wearing this today
and then I tried ivory which is this one
you guys these are orange on your face I
don't know how else to describe it it's
it looks normal when you but you blend
it in and it does turn to like a powder
pretty quickly but look at it you guys
see how orange it is I don't know if
it's doing it any justice I don't know
how to describe it it got stuck like in
my eyebrow hairs and it looked crazy you
guys crazy so I mean I was talking I'm
like I have never do you guys see how
orange my finger is that's it that's the
perfect proof right there
I've never in my life tried a foundation
I hate this stuff and you guys know I'm
always honest with you whether it's sent
to me or not and this was sent to me and
I hated it it's terrible do not spend
your money it'd be different it's like
one look at that that's what it looks
like on my skin right now right there
it'd be different if like you know one
of the shades happen to be like this but
the other one was okay no they both
looked like that it was crazy and you
cannot get it off but the other two
foundations I recently bought this is
the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous in 210
I got a little darker than I usually do
because it matched it's a little more
yellow it just matches better but I
turned it a couple times I'm not totally
sold on it but I'm gonna keep trying it
and then this is the covergirl outlast
stay fabulous in 842 again a little
darker than what I've tried I think I
like it I'm still not sold I
not found a covergirl foundation that I
loved ever but I'm still trying about
one of these two is breaking me out and
I think it might be this one but I need
to get to the bottom of it science
experiment I've got my favorite
drugstore primer in here this is the
Rimmel lasting finish primer I do not
use fibers every day but when I do
probably like once a week this is the
one I like to use then I pulled out my
Ben Nye luxury powder in cameo it's just
a really light kind of ivory light
powder it looks really pretty on your
under eye to make it look brighter but
also to set your concealer and these are
cheaper than you would think they sell
like big jars of it but this one you can
get online for like 12 bucks and it's a
little more makeup bag friendly see I
just spilled it out and then I also have
my favorite lip balm this is the nukes
Rev de Mille this is a an amazing lip
balm that a lot of you guys told me
about and it's just oh my gosh I love it
I have two of them I brought them at
Target on their online website and then
I just got some eyebrow things and my
Sephora pencil sharpener so that is
everything in my everyday makeup drawer
this month so as you can see there are a
lot of new products in there that I'm so
excited to try I'm wearing on my lips
right now the Milani amore matte lip
cream I think I inverted the name there
but I love this stuff so much it's so
comfortable it doesn't come off I want
to get a couple other colors than that
but I'm really liking that stuff and I
am wearing the Naked palette that I also
showed you because I haven't worn in a
long time so I'm wearing that as well so
