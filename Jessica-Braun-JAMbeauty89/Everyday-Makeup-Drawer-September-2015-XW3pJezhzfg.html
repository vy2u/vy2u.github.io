going to share with you my everyday
makeup drawer I used to do these once a
month but I'm gonna try and do them more
often because I really am changing out
what I'm using week to week a lot more
often than once a month so and you know
I've gotten some new products that I'm
wanting to try out so basically what
these videos are if you don't know is a
series I do where I show you the one
drawer in all of my collection here that
I've kind of collected either new
products or products that I feel like
I've kind of gotten lost in my
collection or maybe they're ones that
I'm I've hit pan on trying to use up
just different things like that that are
gonna be in there and that's the kind of
the drawer I go to first when I'm
getting ready each morning now I've got
everything nearby so I'm not having to
fish especially if I'm running late for
work
but beyond that it's just really nice to
be able to have some products right in
the forefront right in my face each day
to make sure that I'm using up and
trying out so let's go ahead and get
into the video so here's the peak in my
upper right drawer in my Alex 5-door set
and I've got a kind of a mixture of
storage things that I'm using like I've
got two of these little three
compartment ones two right here well
here in here and I think I got these at
Target in the bath organization section
for like 3 or 4 bucks so if I could find
them online and we'll definitely link
them below because they were they're
great and then I've got this I got at
the Dollar Tree and this is one I got at
probably bed bathroom Anand or The
Container Store a little more expensive
because it's thicker plastic but really
really nice and they've got little
bumpers on the bottom to stay put so
that is kind of how I'm storing
everything this time around so let's go
ahead and get into the products that I'm
going to be using this month so here in
this front compartment I've got like the
eye liner I'm using the essence I love
extreme and this one's got a huge wand
I'll show it to you guys so I really
really like it but I've kind of
forgotten about it so I'm gonna try and
use that some more look how big that is
like a caterpillar but I really do like
it and it's really inexpensive I've also
got this Maybelline better skin this
might have been in my last one too but
I'm still not giving it love so I need
to I can't decide if it's because I just
don't lie
get er I don't know I need to use it
some more this I just got I bought on
Birchbox cuz they had like a I don't my
ref it was a deal on it or something but
it was the benefit they're real push-up
liner and this is bizarre because it's
like a gel liner that's supposed to
squeeze through this tippy-top so you
like twist it and it comes through it
and it's supposed to be like a gel liner
but it's kind of not patchy but it will
sometimes it'll break off it's very
bizarre but I I've only used it once or
twice so I definitely want to try that
out some more then I just got some
liners than my Stila stay all day liner
that I love to liquid one and then just
some pencil liners too from Stila Brown
and a gold and then this one we got in a
one of the subscription boxes that do
say cosmetics liner that were black
waterproof one so use kind of switching
those all off I also got this in a
subscription box this is the makeup
Beauty black gel liner and I'm really
liking it so far it's got a really
creamy consistency this one was Laura
Geller kind of duo highlighter this is
French vanilla and that one is Portofino
and it is so absolutely gorgeous I'll
show you a little swatch when you mix
them together it's the prettiest this
doesn't even do it any justice but it is
so so beautiful on the skin I love it
this is the NYX HD blush I guess they're
calling it but it's in taupe it's a
really nice contour shade but it's a
little darker than what I'm used to but
I'm wanting to use this up some more
I've clearly used a lot but wanting to
give it some more love so that wasn't
here and this one is the pixie bronzer
and I was hoping this is new to me I was
hoping it'd be like the subtly suntouch
bronzer that I really like from them but
this one is in the shade summertime and
it is really nice but it's got some
shimmer to it but it's kind of gray
toned in a way to go see that I thought
that was kind of cool so I'm kind of
using that one over here I've got the
foundation that I has changed my life
and I'm not even joking the best
foundation I've ever used in my life by
gorgeous cosmetics it's got a pump I
love love love it and I wear the shade
one in B B P whatever that means that's
the shade I wear then this is one that's
getting lost in my collection I want to
use up this is the dr. jart beauty balm
and it was really expensive
it's a like hard back one even though it
looks like it's a two but it's got a
pump it's really nice I just need to use
it more often and I've got my honest
Asya brow wiz and then lip gloss I can't
stop using is this my NYC liquid lip
shine in Brighton Beach peach it's so so
beautiful and then this one's getting
lost is the Too Faced melted liquefied
lipstick and melted peony and it's a
beautiful I mean it kind of looks like
this color it's beautiful and kind of
matte but I haven't been using it so I
wanted to use it somewhere and over here
this is one of the Too Faced sweethearts
blush bronzer things this one's in
Carrie and big like from Sex in the City
and I love the bronzer the blush you
just can't really get to and I'm not
really that impressed with it and I
think the idea is that you could also
mix them together but I just have been
using the bronzer and you can tell I've
been using it this one is a little
lighter in my opinion than the Ross and
Rachel one which I have so I'm using
this one right now two lipsticks I'm
using a lot this is the wet and wild 903
C just peachy and it's this beautiful
peach colored I'm wearing it today I was
wearing at the beginning of the video I
just love this and you know they can be
kind of dry but once you like get it
going it always ends up looking
absolutely gorgeous and I love this
paired with that the NYC liquid lip
shine so the other lipstick I have in
here is this one from Chanel and it's in
it's a Rouge Coco lipstick and for 24
Edith this is special to me because
Tyler bought it for me
when we were leaving Paris in the
airport and it's just this gorgeous pink
shade it wears beautifully I just wore
this to a wedding the other day and it's
just gorgeous and you know I get that
sometimes there are lipsticks that are
more expensive but it really is worth
the money and in this case I mean oh my
gosh anyway so this is just a face
moisturizer it's this is from a brand
called B enigma and it's got manuka
honey bee venom and shea butter and i
like it i don't think it's a
life-changing but it is it makes my skin
feel really nice so I'm using that right
now then up here on this side I've got
kind of some eyeshadows I'm trying to
use this is one of my favourite quads
it's called chai latte from Maybelline
and it's just got four really beautiful
shades I love these two right here
they're just absolutely gorgeous Gor
colors and I'm just constantly impressed
and I just love these colors and since
it's getting to be fall at just chai
latte just seems it just seems so
appropriate I love it and then these two
I just wasn't using anymore and these
are my infallible loose shadows from
L'Oreal I have eternal sunshine and iced
latte and I've loved these for so long
but I haven't used them so I brought
them forward and then this terena
Tarantino duo is absolutely gorgeous I
love these two shades to be honest I
don't even know if this is still
available I got it on HauteLook a long
time ago but I love it
so over here I have my Milani shadow
eyes which I use is like an eye primer I
just draw this and rub it in and it's
beautiful really creamy nude color kind
of like the Mac Paint Pot in painterly
is what I mentioned in my favorites
video is so true it really is then I've
got this
Chella eyebrow defining gel it's just a
clear brow gel I've just been you trying
to use up it's great I mean it works
well but it's nothing life-changing so
I'm just trying to use that up this I
got in a subscription box it's the so
Susan statement skin highlighting
crayons so I'm trying this out right now
and it's just a really pretty you know
kind of creamy highlight and it blends
pretty well it seems I've only used it a
couple times so I'm definitely trying to
give this some love to see how I feel
about it and then I'm also trying out
the mana conditioning lash primer it's a
white primer but you use it right before
you use your mascara and it actually is
doing its kind of lengthening my lashes
so I'm it's exciting to me I haven't
found a lash primer that does as well as
that then this these are all
subscription box things actually this is
the delicious lip balm and I got it in
one of the boxes and it smells like
vanilla cake slash vanilla tobacco it
smells really nice but I really like it
it's really soft on my lips so I've been
using that in the mornings then this is
the tease read my lips lipstick and it's
in the shade killing me softly that's
fun killing me softly with his gorgeous
kind of orange coral color I've only
used it once and I didn't love the way
it looked like this color looked on me
but I do want to try to come
more times cuz I mean it's so creamy and
pigmented I was so impressed so I'm
gonna keep using that this is kind of my
blush Dominion right now this is the
makeup geek blush in secret admirer it's
a gorgeous almost purplish pink blush I
love it it stays on all day and they're
not even that expensive the only
downside is you can pretty much only buy
them online so then this one I just
forgot about this is the Milani baked
blush and delicioso pink and I know it
looks scary but and it kind of swatches
scary but it really is absolutely
gorgeous when it's blended out I really
really do like it
so trying to give that one some more
love this was also kind of lost this is
the color pop super shock cheek and
trickery maybe we think of Halloween so
but it's this gorgeous light peach shade
I absolutely love it and especially if
I'm wearing a peach blush that day I
like to put this on first kind of as
like a I don't know it just ends up
lasting longer when you have a cream
blush and a powder blush on top I love
this color I don't think that the
colour-pop blushes are I don't know I
don't think they're long wearing because
I really can't just wear them alone
otherwise it'll be gone here's another
cream blush by Dalton or Dalton that I
guess the woman's last name is Dalton
hydrogel hydrogel cream blush and flirt
now this one is I've got blush all over
my fingers right now kind of a deeper
tone but I thought it'd be nice in the
fall it's pretty dark at first but I
wore it the other day and I used my Real
Techniques nipple brush and it actually
looked really really nice so it blends
very well but it's a little almost
thicker than a lot of cream blushes
which i think means it which i think is
what is making it last longer on my
cheeks so I've been pretty impressed
with that then back here I've just got a
Sonia Kashuk brightening powder for
setting my concealer it's got a nice
kind of Sheen to it it's a beautiful
under eye setting powder this is my NYC
smooth skin loose face powder I use
everyday makes my skin feel flawless I
love it and then this is just kind of my
no-nonsense products things I use
everyday my makeup remover pen
scissors tweezers eyedrops the elf acne
like little roll-on and then this is the
elf i refresh and I don't know if it
really does anything for your eyes but I
know when I'm tired in the morning I
like how cool it feels around my eyes so
I've just been anything that morning so
yeah that is everything that's in my
chart I can link my other everyday
makeup drawer play this while the whole
plays with all of my videos down below I
just did one a couple weeks ago and I've
you know clearly switched it out I
change up the storage compartments I use
in there all the time as well I just
can't make up my mind I just like change
I guess so definitely check those out
and subscribe if you guys enjoyed and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
