into clutter now I also have some Z
palettes and some like shadows on top
and just other singles that I need to go
through and keep some I haven't decided
if I'm going to do that in this video or
in another but um we'll see I also have
all of my cream shadows single shadows
pigments and think anything like
eyeprimer x' that i need to go through
as well again we'll see if i do it in
this video or in another but those are
all with me but let's do our palettes
now I do have some duo's and things in
here but we might as well just go
through while we're at it this is gonna
be hard but I need I'm eeen this is
insane I don't I know that I'm a
obviously a beauty vlogger but this is
more than what I need to keep and it's
kind of overwhelming me so let's go
through it let's start over here like I
always do in my declutter videos this is
the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani palette you
guys I'm gonna get rid of this I was so
excited to buy it I'd swatched it when
when I was in Chicago in a department
store I swatch it I'm like oh my gosh I
need it I ended up buying it online and
some of the shadows are nice and for me
I thought this is right up my alley it's
so neutral but they just I don't know
like there's something about this
palette like I feel like I this isn't
there still good but they're not like
classic like let's watch some Naked
palette shall we like they're not
classic like urban decay typically is
like look at the difference between
those three and these two these are so
much more buttery and you could swatch
any of these colors and they'd be that
good so I was just kind of underwhelmed
by this and I know there is kind of
mixed feelings about it on YouTube
anyway I'm just sad because I loved how
many neutrals there were and the
packaging of course is beautiful but I'm
going to sell this on my Poshmark
website so I'll link that below I'm
going to get rid of that now this is the
tartlet in bloom palette I'm going to
keep I just got this I was so impressed
it has tons of matte shades and then
three shimmer shades and they're just so
beautiful let me get like a matte one
too they're so pigmented it's insane I
can't believe it's taken me this long to
actually buy
the tartlet palette looked pretty too
but this is the Tarla in bloom and i was
so impressed with both the quality of
the shadows how well they blend and the
packaging so this is like my new baby
like I can't stop using it so I'm gonna
keep that I'm sorry I've got to like
stretch my legs out here so just deal
with it alright this one this is an M by
Michelle Phan court not quad palette the
life palette mini in valentine life
I just wasn't impressed it's not bad I
can't say that it's bad bad this is like
a bronzer it's just not it's just not
great in fact now that i'm swatching it
some more maybe it is kind of bad i
thought when i swatched it before yeah
there were some good shades like this
shade here was pretty nice but pretty
much all of the rests were like mmm that
one's okay the gold one just really
wasn't impressed and I don't use like
lip lips and little pans like that so I
just wasn't impressed I'm gonna get rid
of that one as well so far - getting rid
of one keeping this is the Too Faced
natural eyes palette this is an old
favourite of mine I've used it for years
I'm still going to use it definitely
keeping um alright Marc Jacobs palette
in Lolita I keep this because I'm like
oh it's Marc Jacobs it really was
expensive was one of the first high-end
products I've ever bought and it really
I mean it's beautiful oh my gosh look at
that it really is beautiful um but I
have shades like this everywhere and I
feel like I never use this I could sell
this and use that money to buy something
I'll actually use whereas this it's
amazing but I'm just never reaching for
it
this middle shade is really really Glary
so it just kind of gets fallout
everywhere I feel like you just can't do
a lot of different looks with this which
is fine because it's not really meant to
be like a huge all-inclusive palette but
the shadows are amazing except for that
one I don't really love this one either
it's kind of like a it's kind of got
like a duochrome to it but it just
doesn't really do much for me so umm
this one I can't say that I regret
buying it but I kind of do because I
felt like I was making my
use it because I spent so much money but
I just didn't love it so I'm gonna get
rid of this one too I can't believe I
never thought I would get rid of it but
I can't believe I'm doing it good job me
all right so now we're getting rid of
three and keeping two this is a Trina
Tarantino duo and Jasper and I love
these they're so amazing this is like a
random find I found on HauteLook and if
you don't know what look is you get like
50% off a bunch of high-end makeup but
the brands will only be on there for a
couple days and then it's gone and then
it'll be back a month later so like
Urban Decay's been on there what else
has been on there Cielo that's actually
where I bought this Stila palette um I
think tart has I'm trying to think just
tons of high-end brands are on there all
the time so that's where I save a lot of
money on a lot of this stuff and then I
don't feel as bad if I end up hating it
because I didn't spend as much money
this is unbelievable
I've got to keep it and see I'm excited
to get rid of a bunch of stuff so that
I'll remember to use this because this
is incredible next thing are these three
Sonia Kashuk quads I recently bought
these for a Sonia Kashuk haul that I did
and why I didn't buy them for a haul I
bought them to try them out but I
mentioned them at all um this one I'm
gonna get rid of it's just a bunch of
like light shades and I was so attracted
to these really cool like glittery ish
ones they're kind of metallic but not
really and they're like thin and streaky
and really all you get on there is like
glitter and nothing else and then
there's glitter all over your face so
all of these have one of those shades
and that's why I thought oh those are so
cool but they all do the same thing so I
literally can't use those shades it's
literally just glitter do you guys see
that it's so terrible um and I was so
disappointed because I heard Topsy talk
about these that they were like dupes
for a Tom Ford quad and that the glitter
child is were amazing and I was like no
they aren't
and I trust talk to you with everything
I was so disappointed um anyway so I
know I'm gonna get rid of this one I'm
trying to think cuz these shadows are
really pretty like the actual other
shadows are cool like they're really
really nice let me this one I really
liked this kind of like
well of course it's not really showing
up maybe they don't swatch well they
looked nice on the eyes that one is
beautiful but I feel like they're so hit
and miss you know what I mean maybe I
shouldn't keep any of them so I think
I'm just gonna get rid of all of them
how disappointing but I'm not ever using
them because I don't want to deal with
that glitter fall out and so then I
don't eat what's the point of even using
them at all
all right up here these were really bad
you guys these are the Revlon not just
news palette I've done a video on them I
will show you there are a couple shades
that are okay but they were pretty bad
you guys um and Revlon make some decent
shadows it's not like you know that they
don't know what they're doing but
they're okay but like that one's really
splotchy and so that was what I found
with a lot of these that it was just so
hit and miss I think this one was a nice
one this like maroon one yeah that was
nice so some of them are okay and I
think if I remember right this one had
more good shadows than this one this one
is in romantic nudes but I was just so
unimpressed so unimpressed so I think
I'm gonna pass these on as well because
they were just kind of like I am getting
rid of a lot I am so I'm only keeping
three so far this is awesome all right
so this is these two Milani little
palettes this one's in bare necessities
and this one is in must-have naturals
and these are so beautiful I love these
shadows like they're so well put
together there if I remember right all
of them are pretty darn pigmented yeah
they really are gorgeous this one I know
I love this is the must-have Naturals
this one I know I'm going to keep you
especially for that shade this one is
also really good oh my gosh do you guys
see this they're just so pigmented and
just gorgeous now I don't want to get
rid of this one either I feel like I
don't need both though you know
I mean and I wish I mean I guess I try
and deep pot these but I don't know if
it's worth all that trouble um I love
this but I want like these three shades
out of there I'm gonna think I'm going
to keep this one I'm going to think
about this one it's going to go kind of
in the middle there all right naked 2
basics palette I never ever reach for
this why keep it right I literally never
reach for it but it really is a good
basics palette I think I think I'm gonna
get rid of it I cannot believe I'm
getting rid of that this is the Sonia
Kashuk eye on neutral shimmer palette I
just recently got this as well and this
I was very impressed with they don't
have any of those weird chunky glittery
shades that were in like the quads and
every single shade is ridiculous
just gorgeous of course I picked ones
that don't show up as well on my skin
tone but they're just so beautiful let
me get some of these darker colors um
the only gripe I would have about this
is that the packaging I like the sleek
simple packaging but a lot of the
shadows are falling out the glue is not
like holding on so I need to actually
reglue some of them in still so I wish
that hadn't happened especially since
this was still like twenty dollars at
Target it wasn't like super cheap but it
really is awesome quality so I'm gonna
keep that one you know why I am going to
get rid of this Milani one I don't need
both goodbye alright
see that's how decisions are made folks
so now we're onto these three covergirl
palettes these were very impressive
palettes like could not believe how
amazing these were do I need all three
probably not so let's kind of go through
them one by one this is the rose it's
they have roses
Golden's and nudes oh my gosh this one
was amazing because of this color right
here it's like this beautiful rose gold
and they do kick up a lot of powder but
you know in a in some ways I don't
really mind that oh my god
they're so pretty let's try one of the
deeper ones oh my gosh they're very very
pigmented very very soft let's try some
of the goldens these have a lot more of
that like green tones - I love that gold
shade though this one has some like
glitter in it I don't I don't love that
shade um but what I did like about this
was this kind of mid-tone color there it
blends it with my skin tone perfectly
but it's a perfect blending color for me
um it's a lot of greens I don't wear
tons of green but I do like it from time
to time that one's nice too now let's
try the nudes that color is so pretty oh
my gosh that color is gorgeous let me
swatch that some more I love that oh
yeah oh my gosh this might be the one
and it's got a mid-tone color in it I
think I'm gonna keep nudes and get rid
of Golden's and roses I like a lot of
these but this has more of what I like
and genuinely I mean I've got all of
these colors and other palettes so I
don't really need all of them so I'm
gonna keep news get rid of Golden's and
roses this is the wet and wild oh
natural palette and let's compare it to
the naked shall we it is o so similar
isn't it like comically similar and you
can see they just like redid the order
of them but boy they're similar like for
example this blue shade with this blue
shade boop-boop same this black shade
with this black shade boop boop pretty
much the same
let's see the only one I don't see is
like Dark Horse I don't see anywhere in
here toasted and hustle I don't really
see so like really those three but like
let's see this would probably be
half-baked yeah that'd have to be boo
boo mmm half-baked is still prettier sin
and this one yeah again sin is just more
pigmented too
um well maybe this would be like toasted
or like maybe it's like sidecar
I don't know yo yeah it looks like
sidecar they're so pretty
um so it's just kind of interesting
obviously it's very similar maybe this
is supposed to be like buck but buck is
much more warm you can tell yeah do I
really need this when I have the good
one probably not so I think I'll get rid
of this as well
Lana might as well keep my naked palette
since you know I am because I just
recently pulled it out I'd post it on
Instagram about it and just started
using again because it's so amazing and
I feel like it's just been like left
alone for so long this is the Cielo in
the light palette I love this palette it
I think that I don't think they sell it
anymore but first of all it has this
color bubbly in this color kitten kitten
is like a really famous one like one of
the best shimmery colors ever same with
bubbly oh my gosh but it's more gold in
there
and then it has this color sunset which
is gorgeous like a deeper kind of bronzy
color and then it has these amazing like
matte colors bliss is amazing sandstone
is amazing of course bliss you can
barely see I think I've got like hard
pan on that one no maybe not they're
just a cool combination of shadows it's
so beautiful and then it's got this deep
black as well so that one I'm going to
keep I've loved that palette for a very
long time this is a Sonia Kashuk little
one and bare necessities honestly I
don't know why I bought this these are
all like the same color I just don't
need it it's gone these two were
terrible it was from the Dollar Tree and
I do all those Dollar Tree hauls so
sometimes the products are incredible
and it's like a shock and I've tried
some la color shadows that were really
good but these just were not so um you
know the packaging is flimsy which I can
get beyond if the shadows are really
good some of them are okay like that I
remember right was pretty good this
green it's not great but it's alright I
think this one was okay too
maybe not um they're just kind of
splotchy they don't really do much so
I'm definitely getting rid of these
now this row is gonna be difficult you
know I'm already keeping my original
naked over there um my naked - I'm going
to keep us well I love all these I used
to like the naked - better but I think I
have realized the naked one is the best
there because I I feel like I could take
a couple shadows out of the naked 2 and
leave the rest because I love ydk it is
stupid gorgeous like might be the
prettiest shadow of all time
really truly um I love that it's got the
matte black that was a good addition it
they both have half baked chopper
reminds me of sidecar where the glitter
gets everywhere I've heard they
reformulated it since I bought these
they're beautiful I love them both I'm
probably gonna keep both of these this
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette I love
I can't believe I love it because I
thought when I looked at pictures I'm
like you like I didn't like the
combination of colors I guess but in the
end I loved it they're ridiculously
pigmented I love rum raisin and bonbon
those are two that I use all the time
butter pecan is so pretty it's this
bigger like kind of vanilla color they
smell amazing the regular chocolate bar
palette I love as well there's a lot of
colors I don't use often like candied
violet black for its truffle I do
actually that looks really pretty though
now that I'm looking at it it's got this
glitter and that's the thing when
there's actual glitter and shadows it
almost always gets everywhere no matter
what primer I use but creme brulee
marzipan these are like ridiculous
colors ridiculous so I'm keeping that as
well hi I don't know I keep forcing
myself to use this and I never love it
I think they're amazing shadows but I
feel like there's nothing in it that I
feel like I can't live without and I
think that's why I never end up reaching
for it because they're really they
really are gorgeous but I feel like I'm
always reaching for other ones over this
and I don't really know why because it's
got everything you could possibly ever
need I wish they would switch these two
colors with each other so it flew more
actually if they put this one here
you guys ever do that and put this one
here where it like flows like light to
dark makes me feel like things are in
order
um anyway it has nothing to do with this
though I don't want to get rid of it yet
because I feel like I need to give it
more of a chance I really haven't used
much of these shades over here they're
beautiful so I think I'm going to give
it more of a chance before I just get
rid of it this is the Loreal a palette
and I love this a lot of people didn't I
don't think the shadows are like the
best quality in the world but I think
they're still pretty good and for some
reason every time I do a look with this
I end up getting a lot of compliments
now these like lighter shades are not
very good but these like mid-tone matte
colors are really really good and I
think they're really powdery though um
that's why I've kept this for so long
because I really do love it so I think
I'm going to continue to keep that okay
so over here is everything that I'm
getting rid of and over here is
everything I'm keeping so 2 4 6 8 10 12
14 16 and I'm getting rid of and 2 4 6 8
10 12 13 this isn't really a palette but
13 that I'm keeping so I got rid of more
than what I'm keeping which is always
awesome and I feel like I can pass these
on to sisters and friends and co-workers
that will actually use them some of the
stuff I'll sell on my Poshmark site like
I said like probably these two in the
Marc Jacobs one we'll see if I sell
anything else the rest I might get rid
of but keep your eyes tuned on there for
when I eventually sell these but yeah I
think not too bad I'm pretty proud of
myself getting rid of a lot of things
that I've had for a long time that I
spent money on but I really don't need
to keep at this point
