well I just finished filming a haul
video but it was more it was a swap with
someone a friend of mine amber that I
met on Instagram and she literally sent
me like a box like huge box filled with
makeup so if you want to watch that
video it's decently long but it's just
so much stuff it's so much fun
so I'll link that down below but I just
finished filming that so now I'm going
to film a separate video for the haul of
things that I've personally bought
within the last like week or two I went
to Old Navy I went to amazon.com and
then also shop lately calm which I know
we've got a problem but they you know
they're the way that the website works
is that the sales you know will show up
and they'll be there for like a week and
then it'll go away kind of like whole
look sort of but it's different anyway
so you know let's say it'll go on like
oh I've never seen this so then I want
to buy it so that's why I buy from it
all the time plus it's really cheap so
you know give me a break everyone
everyone calm down anyway so um we'll go
ahead and start with shop elated because
I'm wearing some things this necklace
right here I bought from shop lately
calm it's just like a really simple thin
gold chain with the gold bar which I've
been wanting one of these for a while
and I finally found I really liked it it
was like four or five dollars um I also
got these earrings here these hoops not
the ones I'm wearing but these hoops
from shop lately they're just gold and
they're incomplete there and it has a
cross on it so I think those are so cute
and then I also got these sunglasses
which I love because it's got this
little gold bar on the side and then a
really thin part here and just it's got
like kind of like the leopard print you
know and they're brown I love them and
I've been eating some new ones because I
keep miss placing mine so and we're
about to go on a trip in a couple of
weeks so I really needed to get some
these were so cute and I think they
might have been like $14 they were not
on sale but I just really really liked
them so yeah and that's not that bad on
sunglasses but anyway so those are my
shop lately purchases now I also did buy
something from
the bomb when it was on HauteLook
recently and I bought some things
actually for Amber and then I bought
this blush for myself it was for it was
$10 on HauteLook um it's the hot mama
blush and everyone talks about this I
remember when I first started watching
YouTube videos
I was watching sammich it's like SAA am
a GE or something like that her name is
Sam and she raved about this and I've
been wanting it ever since it's been
like a year or two and I've been wanting
it and I was just so excited to finally
get it was ten dollars on there like I
said I think originally it's like around
20 so it's beautiful it reminds me of
the NARS blush what's the name of it you
guys know it you know which one I'm
talking about it's like the most famous
of why is the name escaping my brain
well whatever it is you guys can let me
know sheesh my brain that videos I told
you so long like I am like sweating like
it's just so much stuff and I was so
excited to show it to you guys so like I
just now feel like you exhausted
exhausted in the best way anyway so um
let's see where should I go next with
this will do my old Navy purchases can
I'm excited about those too
these earrings okay first of all old
Navy now sells jewelry who knew and I
was talking to lady there that worked
there and I said uh what like steps when
she was like yeah we just started doing
it they have like I mean it was so much
jewelry was awesome and all of it was so
cute I got these gold hoops which I love
because they're kind of like
multi-dimensional there looks like
almost like a two things like kind of
twisted together but not really and it's
real sparkly and they're humongous and
here's I'm gonna take this out to show
you I love hoops that do have that
closure because it just makes me feel
like it's not gonna fall out so I really
appreciate that in a hoop so I was
really excited about these and then this
ring okay these this was 695 and they
were having like a 30 percent off sale
look at this ring isn't that so cute
very very simple and like it's got like
that it's silver with like a little bit
of like darker things and these were I
want to say around 6 95 as well but
again they were 30% off so I didn't pay
full price for anything of course
what if I ever paid full price for it
that's not true anyway I also this was
in the checkout okay you know those long
shot bags that everyone carries well let
me show you this first I've been wanting
one for a long time and they're like uh
I don't even know how to describe them
but um they're really really cute and
they're great to be like a carry-on when
you're traveling or for like an
overnight bag and I really don't have a
bag for that purpose and I've really
been wanting one and so I've kind of had
that on my wish list in my head along
shan-pak but they're like a hundred
dollars then I found this at Old Navy
and I about lost my freaking mind it was
it was on clearance for 997 and it's
this it's just like the longshot bags
it's got the brown handles with whatever
color they had different colors but I
chose black but and it's about the same
size it's like the large ones but it has
this extra handle here and it has an
outside pocket with which the longshot
backs that I was looking at and didn't I
didn't look at all of them I don't know
how many they have but it has an outside
pocket and then it also has some pockets
on the inside it was ten dollars guys
ten freakin dollars and they have ones
with patterns they have like once I
think they have like anchors on it they
were adorable so if you're looking for a
bag like that and they had smaller sizes
to go to Old Navy
somewhere on clearance some were not so
you know even the ones that weren't on
clearance this was originally well let's
see if I can peel the clearance sticker
off this was originally 26 so that's not
that bad it seems to be pretty darn well
made I love that it dips up completely
so everything's kind of safe in there
especially if you are using it for a
carry-on which this would be perfect you
can put a full laptop in it just tons of
stuff I lost my mind I really did you
guys when I saw that so in that same
style they had at the checkout for like
yeah 390 for these little ones that they
were so they had this turquoise color in
the big bag by the way too and I was
gonna get a matching black one to match
that but then I was like well I'm not
only gonna use it when I use it as a
carry-on I'm gonna use this in my bag
all the time I'm not sure for what yet
but I'll let you guys know but I thought
the teal was cute because it makes me
think of Jasmine from Aladdin like the
teal she wears and then the gold
we're like Egyptian type of you know
what I mean so I was really excited for
four bucks and then 30% off of that it
was pretty a pretty good deal really
cute
okay so I also I've been looking for
silver tight flip-flops and I used to
have one just like this and I wore them
to death and I think I bought them at
like New York and company then I found
these for around these were 20 and then
they were 30% off so I'm gonna for like
14 bucks is that math right I think so
they just have this really pretty
silvery like bedazzled detail but
they're really thin which I like they're
super comfy there's a little bit of
squish to them but they do have like
structure um they're just so cute
they're comfortable you can wear them
with everything and basically my rules
for like summer sandals I have to have
ones that are like gold and ones that
are silver cuz those you can really
match with anything and then anything
above that great you know you can have a
lot more variety but those for me I
always have to have at least those two
so I had been looking for silver ones
loved these Target really didn't they
had some cute sandals this year but they
didn't have their typical ones that they
always have that I always go for so I
was like they had ones that are sort of
but I just didn't love them so anyway
Old Navy had a wall of adorable
flip-flops flip-flops flip-flops sounds
hilarious maybe we'll just start calling
them fit pops let's just change the
language completely okay so I'm really
excited about these okay and the last
thing I got from amazon.com I've been
looking into self-tanner and okay I used
it and I know to you guys I probably
still look just as pale as I always do
but in person cuz I'm like right in
front of huge winner that's completely
washing me out but I like I look
completely tanner in person I wish you
guys could see it because it I was like
ecstatic there's no streaks this is well
let me just say I was inspired by makeup
by Tiffany D did a video on how she
self-tans with the Saint Tropez bronzing
mousse or foam and so I was gonna I just
look at it I'm like it's really
expensive but I might try it because I'm
so pale I don't want to go get fried in
the Sun you know and so I'm like natural
glow I use but it doesn't quite get
be as stark of a look as I wanted and
blah blah blah so I did some research
and then I found this which the Saint
Maura's or Moritz I'm not sure how to
pronounce it
bronzing mousse just the same and they
have medium and dark they might have
light as well I'm not sure but I went
ahead and got the dark just based on
reviews I was reading and I got the myth
that comes with it well you have to
order it separate I think but I got the
myth of the same brand I did it last
night I kind of cleaned it I mean it's
kind of a mess but anyway you guys like
in person I look so much darker there's
no streaks you can like you know I did
it last night after exfoliating and
moisturizing etc but you could do it you
know another time if you want and get a
darker look if you want you know it's
kind of up to you and it's not as
intimidating as I thought so that was
just so exciting so many youtubers have
done great how-to videos on how to do
things like this and they're very
helpful so if you're nervous about it
this is cheap it was under $10 whereas
the Saint Tropez for the same size
around the same size is a lot more I
want to say like 30 to 40 dollars and
you can get some for 18 but they're
really small I mean you know the myth
was only like 5 or 6 dollars now if you
live in the UK someone on Instagram told
me in the UK you can pick this stuff
like anywhere and it's for even cheaper
but on Amazon I wanted to get it quickly
before my trip so I decided to order
from a place in like California it was a
little more expensive whereas if I got
one from shipped from the UK it was
actually a lot cheaper but I didn't want
to risk like not getting it in time so I
think when I repurchase this cuz I'm
sure I will when I do I'm gonna go ahead
and do a UK shipper and then it will be
cheaper I mean I can kind of buy it in
bulk - I think they had like to pack so
anyway I hope that I'm still filming if
I'm not I'm just gonna die because I've
had so many cameras used today anyway so
that is all and I hope you enjoyed the
video and I will see you guys soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
