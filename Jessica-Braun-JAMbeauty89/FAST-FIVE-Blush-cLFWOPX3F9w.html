brand new segment that I'm gonna call
Fast Five and it's going to be where I
feature five products within whatever
category that specific video is that I'm
really loving at the moment or maybe
even like all-time favorites so for
example today's Fast Five is Fast Five
blushes and I'm going to share with you
guys five blushes that I think are
really great and if you're looking for a
certain color or finish of a blush I
have some great recommendations for you
guys some are cheaper and some are more
expensive so it's just kind of you know
wherever you want to spend your money so
here we go so the first blush I wanted
to share with you guys is a NYX blush
and it's in the shade dusty rose and
this is the color that I think is my
absolute favorite when it comes to going
like to work or going to a more serious
event where you don't necessarily want
anything sparkly you don't want anything
kind of in-your-face this is a very
no-nonsense color I think it's really
pretty it has a matte finish and these
run they're under $10 but I'm not sure
exactly how much there's kind of a
swatch of it if you guys can see that
it's just a really nice soft finish it's
not too pink it's almost more like a I
mean the name is dusty rose and I think
that's a perfect title for it so I
really really recommend this blush okay
another blush this one's a little bit
pricier is from the balm it's called
their down boy blush and they also have
ones one called frat boy one called um
they all have boy cabana boy and then
there's the really famous one I think
they just called their hot mama blush
but anyway so this one's like a cool
toned pink and these are incredibly
pigmented very very dull pink if you
will really pretty this is one you have
to be really careful with which most of
these are but this one especially but I
really like them they are pricier like I
said but if you're willing to spend the
money and you're wanting really nice
when these stay on all day all of the
blush is staying on all day but
especially the balm blushes they seem to
have really strong lasting powers
they're kind of worth the money in that
respect and it's just a really nice
pretty matte pink color okay another one
is an elf blush and these are from their
studio lines so these are three dollars
in drugstores like I know I've seen them
at Target sorry my contact is like
driving me nuts okay in target they sell
a lot of them but online they have an
even bigger shade selection on eyes lips
face comm which I can link down below
but this one's in candid coral and this
is a beautiful peach color it might be
hard to see but it's really really
pretty yeah it's kind of hard to see on
my skin tone but I think this is a nice
peach color especially if you have fair
skin because other peach colors can look
too peachy if you will but it is a lot
lighter of a finish and this one has
kind of a satin finish but it's
borderline matte it's definitely not
shimmery or sparkly I really really like
this and I think it would look nice on
darker skin tones too so not just her
fair skin tones but I think it is nice
for lighter skin tones I'm so I have two
more blushes to go I really really love
this wet and wild blush it's in
pearlescent pink it's just this
beautiful so it doesn't fall out this
beautiful like oh my gosh it's like
crazy pigmented that was like the worst
thing you're just watching on um
definitely a shimmery finish almost like
a golden golden shimmer um but it's so
Wow
it's right there um it's just so
beautiful again use it with a light hand
but um I think it blends out pretty well
but definitely you don't want to put it
on too strong because it won't it's not
as easy to blend away because it's a
very strong color but it's beautiful
this is a great color I think at night
like for going out because it has that
shimmer to it this looks especially nice
on darker skin tones but I think it
looks nice on everyone especially if you
can use a lighter hand with it I love
these these are like three to five
dollars depending on where you go
usually it's around 399 and then the
last question when I mention is my
Milani baked blush in Luminoso I love
all of their blushes but this is the
standout one I know I've talked about it
a lot and I might link to some videos
some
around me where I mentioned the blush
but I just love it it's again a peachy
color but it does have some shimmer to
it so it's not as matte as like the elf
blush that I mentioned the candid coral
but it has the nice shimmer I love this
it looks great in the daytime great at
night and all of their blushes they have
a lot of different colors of course so
if you're not big on peach colors then
they have other things dolce pink is
another one that I really really like so
that is all I hope you guys enjoyed this
