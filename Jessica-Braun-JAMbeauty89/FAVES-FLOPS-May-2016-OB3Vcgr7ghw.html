my may favorites and my swaps I'm gonna
go all my flops at the end I know I
usually just kind of interspersed them
throughout but a lot of you guys like I
don't remember what you loved and what
you didn't know like it's valid points
so I'm gonna put all the flops at the
end so if you don't care about what I
liked and you only want to see what I
didn't like fast forward
if you want to see at all then let's go
ahead and get into it I have way too
many favorites this month like more than
I think I've ever had this is gonna be a
long video so grab some tea or some
sparkling water or some coffee or some
popcorn I'm naming things that I want
right now like a popcorn sounds great
I'm gonna start with the makeup items
because I'm sure most you want to see
that and then I have tons of other stuff
so one of my favorites is the L'Oreal
Lumi cushion this I've had for a while I
liked it when I first tried it but it
kind of got shoved to the side as I
tried new foundations new BB creams but
I pulled this back out a few weeks ago
and I was like hey yo this is good it
really is good all right the only thing
garces me out is the sponge and you
really do have to use a sponge but you
guys have told me different ways to
clean this so I'm definitely go I need
to clean it obviously but it's just got
that little sponge in there with the
stuff in it you can take it out and flip
it if it starts to run out I've heard
that works really well mine isn't run
out yet but what I love about it is I
actually don't use it only alone I
usually will use like a BB cream and
then if I see like oh there's a lot of
like hyperpigmentation showing through
that's when I'll grab this and just
press it on really quick before I start
putting blush and stuff on and it's got
great coverage for such a thin formula
and I think that's what I appreciate
about this the most is just that it's
really thin it's got pretty darn good
coverage for how thin it is and it is
really easy to apply with a little
sponge so it's just so quick you don't
need a separate brush or you know to
sponge it's all in one this would
probably be a great thing to travel with
as well next thing is oh my gosh this
lip product is amazing this is the
Burt's Bees lipstick in five oh one
blush Basin I recently hauled this this
is just
most moisturizing beautiful color in a
lipstick it's just so simple I have worn
it like every day since I bought it it's
been in my purse and then I have to pull
it out because I want to put it on even
when I'm at home it's just so
moisturizing and comfortable and
beautiful and I just can't I even think
the packaging is cute I see it and I
think oh like my heart kind of like
skips a beat for a second I love it next
favorite is another lip product this is
the Hanalei lip treatment and this came
in a recent subscription box it might
have been FC I'm not sure this stuff is
amazing I looked it up online and it's
like $15 and you can like only buy it on
one website like on their website I'm
like dang it but I think I'm gonna bite
the bullet buy it because this stuff it
smells amazing it's a really thick lip
treatment that's like petroleum jelly I
don't want to even waste it it's just a
really thick one it smells amazing and
it just moisturize my lips like crazy I
love putting this stuff on I love it so
this is one of those things that I'm
like it's such a random thing that you
can't really buy anywhere but I'm
obsessed with it and I was like do I
want to bring it up because it's so hard
to get but I'm like no you guys need to
know so if you got this in your epsy bag
or whichever it was definitely try it if
you haven't it's amazing so this next
favorite is a brush and I don't often
have makeup brush favorites but this one
stood out that much that I'm like I need
to tell someone about it this is from
carroty and I did a sponsor video with
them gosh a couple months ago if like
Mac dupes and if you haven't seen it all
like it below because they really do
have a lot of Mac dupes it's kind of
insane but this brush and I don't I
didn't really talk about the brush as
much in that video
this is their e 20 - and I don't know
what it's marketed as but I use it for
eyeliner it is amazing I have the Mac
eye liner brush and it's good but I
almost think this is better because it
just my liner lied it on so smoothly I
could do the winged really quick with it
it's thin enough and precise enough to I
mean you can just be so precise with it
and I feel like so many liner brushes
are so thick or are so many layers that
it ends up messing up all right next
thing is the
it cosmetics your skin but better CC
plus full coverage cream this is in
light I have had this before and I liked
it but it was never in the right shade
I've had it fair and it was too light I
had it medium is way too dark light is
perfect this is something that has SPF
of 50 which is amazing not for flash
photos but for everyday life and I
finally found the shade light works the
best for me and it really does have a
ridiculous amount of coverage I've just
called a CC cream honestly it really is
like a foundation it's not it's
certainly not a BB cream it's got some
skin benefits but as I've looked it up
if I remember right it really wasn't
touted online as that great for your
skin I don't think it's necessarily bad
but it's not like amazing for your skin
but it really does have such amazing
coverage and such like it makes your
skin looks like look like it's just
alive and beautiful that I'm like dang
this is actually just like a trial size
they recently sent in the mail but I
want to get like a full sized one next
makeup favorite this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory
wonder bronze this was something they
sent with a bunch of stuff and this one
was like the only thing I opened right
away because I was like what it is so
ridiculous isn't it
I've been wearing this as a blush yes
it's a bronzer but when you truly swirl
it all together it's almost like a peach
toned blush and so I've used it kind of
in this whole region I didn't use it
today I've used it just in this entire
region for like two weeks straight it is
so gorgeous and glowy and it makes your
skin look so dewy and it stays on for
such a long time and the packaging is
cute too so it's all a win some more
favorites this is the sea reveille
hydrating cleanser this is my like
drugstore holy grail cleanser for my
face my I had a lot of dry skin right
here recently and I'm like it must maybe
it was allergies like blowing my nose
and my eyes itching it's finally cleared
up once I switched to this I think the
cleanser I was using at the time which
was like it was I think it was al
Jeunesse or something but I just it did
not mesh well with my skin I ended up
giving it away but this one is just so
hydrating it feels crazy when you use it
because I can't describe the feel if
you've ever used it you you probably
know what I mean
this is amazing it lasts me quite a
while and I use it every single night
and it just doesn't dry my skin out but
it really does clean it and I love that
about this and my skin totally was
moisturize again after about a week of
using this so I was very thankful for
that and this is one that when I run out
of my polished choice and I haven't
ordered more this is always what I go
for it speaking of skin this is from
Aveeno I'm actually doing something on
Instagram with them very soon I'm
waiting to hear back from them but this
was actually a product I'm doing you on
because I'm obsessed with it and they
don't know I'm doing this video this is
not a sponsor I mean they have no idea
I'm talking about it this has this
nourishing coconut smell that's like
definitely coconut like you can
definitely say oh that smells amazing
but it's so light that it just you never
get tired of it does that make sense I
feel like there are some coconut smells
that I get tired of really quick and
it's one of my favorite scents this
one's so light that it's I'm almost done
with it and every time I use it I'm like
man like this smells so amazing I love
getting in my loofah it's like this
amazing experience I also use it for
bubble bath because it's the most
amazing soft bubble bath you have to go
try it it's almost gone and I'm like
this is like the first body wash in
years
that I will be repurchasing I think
there used to be a dove one I loved and
that one I have you purchased a couple
times but it's been years and I'm
planning on repurchasing this and
usually usually body wash I get so tired
of or I feel like it's not good for my
skin so I switch to something else when
it's done no this one I'm buying again
can't even wait to buy it again so good
speaking of smells this one's like
special this is the Garnier whole blends
repairing shampoo and conditioner it's
their honey treasures with royal jelly
honey and propolis extracts this
smells like honey and wonderment this is
a smell that reminds me of when we were
in Paris because there was a honey type
there was like a honey soap that was in
the bathroom in the place we were
renting and it smelled exactly like this
and so every time I smell something like
this I'm like oh my gosh I'm like
instantly transported back to being in
Paris that summer and so this when I
smelled I was like oh my gosh
bought it it smells amazing my hair
smells amazing after using it the only
thing I would say is if you have really
oily hair you might want to stay away
this is really moisturizing I think it
kind of weighs my hair down a little bit
or at least I would wouldn't necessarily
weighs it down but I feel like it really
is super moisturizing so you don't want
to necessarily get the conditioner all
near your scalp if you do if you are
prone to oily hair now let's talk about
the does
so this Sonia Kashuk one there were a
couple in my Sonia Kashuk Hall or like
my target hall that I just did the other
day that we're kind of duds and I'm only
gonna mention one in this because this
was like the biggest of the duds if
you're curious about the other ones I'll
link to target hall below but this is
their extreme where I primer and I just
felt like it didn't really work well
it's you know it's an okay primer but
it's literally I can't get into it with
my nails I just can't like it's hard to
reach if you have really short nails
that's not a problem and most of the
time my nails aren't this long but even
still I'm like it's such a thin opening
I'm like why wouldn't they just make it
the length of the pot like it doesn't
really make any sense to me but I just
didn't feel like it performed well
either it didn't really cancel out
anything so simple gosh this could just
be in a squeezy - I don't know I just
was not impressed with it at all next
thing I had high hopes for this is like
new to me this is the the brow gal by
Tanya crooks clear water-resistant
eyebrow gel and I got this in a recent
either boxycharm rep C and you guys said
in the comments you said beware cuz it's
really a weird formula and I was like
okay
so I used it and you guys were so right
like you brush it through and it's clear
it's meant to hold your brow hairs in
place there was literally crusty white
stuff above my brows every time I use it
no matter if I cleaned it off no matter
if I avoided it was just crusty and like
you could see it it looked like dry skin
it was so gross it was so gross and I
felt like it did hold my brows in place
but with that added stuff I'm like no
there's better out there so and this one
was still like $18 so it's like the same
or maybe even more it's like the same
price as the Anasazi one so that one I'm
tossing out the last dud these are from
my Dollar Tree haul last week these are
the LA Colors six color eyeshadows this
one's an almost nude and this one's in
Haute like hot they just and you even
saw in that video when i swatched them
the some of the shadows are beautiful
like there's this gold one in here it's
gorgeous but then there are some they're
just like and they didn't really blend I
mean some of them show up great some of
them really don't so I felt like because
they're so hit-or-miss I wouldn't
recommend them now does that mean every
piece of LA color eyeshadows bad no
because honestly I've had some la color
shadows like single ones that were
amazing so some of them really are good
but I feel like these are just so
hit-or-miss that I couldn't recommend
one palette over the other so those were
all of my favorites and flops for this
month I will link my last month's which
was April my favorites and flops from
that month down below as well if you are
curious and you want to see what else
I've been loving and maybe not loving so
much other than that I hope that you'll
subscribe to catch more and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
