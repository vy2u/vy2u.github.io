and BB trains and I have to admit as I
was like working through these and I'm
like okay what am I going to do next art
foundation but when I was looking to my
doors open oh I'll do primers next I was
like no like for some reason primers are
I'm like newly in love with them so I
have way too many but really the same
goes for foundation because I've got way
too many and they're all going to go bad
probably around the same time so I
really need to pare this down and think
about okay what shades match me some of
this was sent to me from companies
online and so they had to kind of guess
at my shade I had to guess at my shade
most of the ones that I personally
bought I actually did buy the right
shade of so and I'll explain kind of as
we go but let's just start the way I've
been starting all DC clutters and
basically I look at my little collection
and I think okay what would I go to the
store and buy again so looking at this
the things I would in a heartbeat buy
again are these two this is why okay if
you're watching this and you're like oh
my gosh and other youtubers that likes
the cosmetics CC cream I'm so blown away
I felt the same way as you yes and I
watch out in there I was so amazing I'm
like wow why is this so amazing I don't
get it guys this is like a foundation
coverage but it's actually good for your
skin I think that's why it's so amazing
it smells good it's got a pump so if you
can really get everything out because
it's a squeezy tube with a pump it's got
cute packaging but on top of that it's
got SPF and it literally looks like it
sounds like it looks like the best
foundation you've ever owned it's like
it doesn't have that dry weird look if
you've got really dry skin like I do it
makes it look so healthy I don't know
how this performs on oily skin m to be
honest because I really I have combo but
mostly dry skin like in the summer is
oily just like classic normal skin this
one I actually bought this was in the
shade light it's perfect for me this
one's in the shade medium mode sent to
me and it's the illumination formula so
what I've been doing lately is mixing
these two because it's the shade works a
little bit better for me because I can't
just use the medium on its own and also
the illumination on its own is a little
bit too much so this is kind of one of
those things that once I run out of this
I'm not going to repurchase I'm just
going to get the regular formula but I
love them both together
I want to get used aren't they the most
beautiful packaging you've ever seen I
don't know why I love it so much so
those are easy easy cheap for me
now I have a sorry my dishwasher is
running right now so theater that
absolutist it's not a big scary monster
I think of like at home alone when he's
scared like the furnace downstairs
anyway so this is the same thing as this
here just a smaller size and since I
travel all the time this is kind of one
of those things that I like to have but
I think hmm who say I have a drawer of
travel-sized toiletries that I just keep
but I was going to say maybe I should
put that in there but when I'm picking
out makeup for travel like I go to my
foundation to him pick out a foundation
so I feel like I'll forget about it so I
think I'll keep it with my foundations
and I am going to keep it but kind of
looking like it's separating cuz I don't
use it so I feel like I need to like use
it soon but I haven't had it for very
long
alright what else would I just go go out
and just buy Oh easy the L flawless
finish foundation I love this I have the
shade sand it's got a pump it is the
most amazing foundation again if you
have dry skin and you haven't tried this
it is the best drugstore price
foundation I've ever tried in my life
period
I love it I wear it all the time it is
so so good and I never thought I honest
to goodness thought oh elf foundations
are probably really crummy I never tried
one denies righteous and I was like well
put my foot in my mouth because this is
incredible so if you have oily skin I
think it would work okay but especially
if you've normal to dry you'll love it
oh my gosh I just can't live about it
what else would I go out and repurchase
right now ah the hourglass foundation
again this is one that I thought I
wouldn't like I'm like I've got dry skin
cream foundation sticks are going to
look horrible on me no like I watched a
video of someone it might have even been
like an hourglass video or so I don't
know but someone applying this and they
use the brush that you can buy with it
here's what I will say if you are going
to splurge to buy this buy the brush
that goes along with it and the reason I
say that is I tried to apply this with
other brushes with my fingers of you
I've tried everything and it never looks
great but when I use the brush
that I know it's really expensive but
when I use the brush that comes with it
it looks unbelievable
I went to a special event in LA it was
like literally the first one I've ever
gone to for two faiths and I was you
know I was kind of nervous because I
didn't really know anyone and the first
one I'd gone to but I wanted you know my
makeup to look awesome but I needed it
to look awesome as West photography as
well I wore this my skin looked
absolutely flawless but you really have
to have a brush with it if you have this
and you've tried with a different brush
that works please let me know because
I'd love to be able to tell you guys
about a cheaper option that works just
as well but I haven't found one so I
love this I have it in a shade shell now
I also have two in the shade porcelain
and buff as well because honestly I
could probably get away with porcelain
right now and Bluff I can probably get
away with in the summer so I think buff
is darker now I want to know
but these I'm not getting rid of because
and I didn't I bought the one in shell
but these I think I got with like if see
points Oh No yikes what happened well
here we go
let's see oh my gosh it's so creamy yeah
so I probably can't get away this buff
right now but maybe like in the summer
time but these are just so good so good
especially you know for your wedding or
for special occasions for prom any time
you're using flash photography
these are foolproof amazing they look
great in person great on camera I love
them oh my gosh now you guys let me know
because I even tried the anasazi ones
those are kind of all my want to try
list I'm curious about if those are I
heard those are really really good as
well so I want to try them alright what
else would I just straight-up go out and
buy this BB cream blew me a way this is
the Misha perfect cover BB cream they
sent this to me a while ago and I'm just
now getting around to trying it it's got
this gray tone that a lot of the Asian
beauty brands that I've tried like their
BB creams it always has like this great
I mean isn't that so gray but it looks
so good on the skin it just it blends in
it ends up covering and like
neutralizing your face
never tried anything like it but it
looks amazing on so that's kind of one
of those things I reach for anytime you
know I'm in a hurry and I'm going to
work and I just want to look put
together but I don't need to look like
blast orthography ready this is what I
reach for it does have SPF of 42 in it
and it's incredible I love the packaging
I wish you could get it just in stores
of course you have to buy it online
right now I know Alicia it's like coming
to the u.s. that's why they sent this to
me that I don't know in what way so
often look that up but I was blown away
now my original favorite BB cream was by
dr. jar and it was this one but it was
actually one in a gold packaging they're
both kind of the same but it's the same
idea where it kind of has this grey tone
to it you see what I'm saying
but that is what kind of makes it so
amazing because it does have decent
coverage it neutralizes your skin it
blends out so it doesn't actually look
foul or grey or anything
but they just blow me away so especially
in the summertime these are the kinds of
products I just absolutely adore and I
use all the time so if I don't always
want like a full face of foundation you
know you're sweating maybe you're going
to the beach this has SPF of 25 the one
in gold has a much higher SPF but I love
these bolt they're my favorite BB creams
of all time so now unless with a couple
more products let's just go through
these one by one so this is a Misha
beauty it goes this I think or maybe
this it's like a you know the cushion
kind of things I have not really Oh have
I not tried this at all I don't know
that I've tried or maybe it system these
are both Misha Beauty maybe it's this
one I'm try no maybe we go oh I don't
even open this bad boy I want to try
these but again because they're not
super readily available I need to look
that up I don't like to mention these
kinds of things so I almost don't want
to fall in love with it because then I'm
going to want to tell you guys about it
maybe it is this one I tried but this is
a refill for one of them I wonder if it
well I wonder if it'll fit in both and
I'm kind of thinking it's this one here
but yeah I think this packaging is
unbelievable and I love the idea of
cushion foundation because I can just
have it in my purse touch up really
quickly and look a lot more put together
my nose gets really read throughout the
day
a-and that's one of those things that
you know if I had time to stretch up
throughout the day that's what I would
do and so I love for these to work since
I haven't really given them enough
chance to try them I'm going to keep
them but if I don't love them after
maybe four or five uses I'm just going
to pass them on to someone that will and
you know what I'm not even sure let me
check the shade on this I'm not even
100% sure looks pretty yellow what are
you guys think it's not that different
from what I use in the hourglass oh so
maybe they blend yeah that looks fun so
I think that one will be okay all right
so continuing on this is the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi cushion I actually
really like this now I don't think you
can tell I've used it quite a bit
I don't think a that it lasts a very
long time like obviously if that's the
thing about them it just doesn't you do
there's not a ton of product in there
I'm going to know they can say how many
yeah that's half of an out so you really
and you know the sponge is absorbing
some of that so you really you run
through it very quickly way quicker than
anything else and yet it's still around
the same price so that's something to
keep in mind but for the convenience
factor especially if you like just the
regular too much lumi I don't think it's
the exact same formula but I think it's
kind of similar I like it and for me
like I've got a lot of freckles so I
like I'll usually put foundation
everywhere and then I'll put this as
like a second layer just on my cheeks to
kind of get rid of any hyperpigmentation
some freckled things like that that I
might want to cover that day especially
if I want like high coverage because I
think alone this doesn't have super high
coverage so I'm going to keep it because
I do like it but again it's one of those
but because I have so many things I
never reach for and I want to reach for
so I'm going to keep that this is a
favorite of mine it's the boots number
seven lift and luminate foundation I
went to Chicago and this is the only
foundation I brought for a week it's
just so beautiful you can buy it at
Target if it was reviewed in my target
video where I talked about a bunch of
Target brand things I have it in one
half look I have it in warm ivory and
it's just so good it's a very it's not
really glowy it's not matte so it's more
glowy than it is matte but it's kind of
right in between where you don't feel
like you're adding just
a ton of shine for no reason it just
looks beautiful and healthy and I really
really like it and it does have SPF of
15 so this Neutrogena will G no one I
like but it's one of those but you know
out of the drugstore there's just not
very many good BB creams and so I've had
this as like a suggestion because it's
okay it's not bad but it's certainly not
like blow your mind amazing so because
of that I've kept it but I'm kind of
thinking it might be time to get rid of
it because I'm never using it it's just
going to go bad I'd rather a sister that
would use it have it before it goes bad
ban me just hold onto it for the off
chance I might mention it once more in a
video you know what I mean it is it is
kind of glowy it doesn't have very high
coverage but it's just a little bit very
lightweight I think it does end up
looking just a little bit oily on your
skin but it's still a pretty good option
I'm still on the hunt for a good BB
cream from the drugstore I want it to be
like these and so far no one has come
out with anything like that if you know
of any that are really inexpensive
please let me know but I'm going to pass
that on is this the first one I've
passed on that's embarrassing
alright let's keep going so the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation concealer
this is just way too dark I ordered it
online having no idea I think this idea
is cool like with the giant doe foot but
it's just way too almost oranjee for me
so I'm going to pass it on I'm hoping
someone else will like it this Clinique
one again way too dark this is one they
sent to Mito so I don't feel too bad but
I still wanted it to work visitin soap
Sahara it's kind of a weird like it's
really oily and maybe it's just because
hello every time I've tried to get
anything out of it it always looks kind
of weird and oily when we pull my sleeve
up here but it's way too yellow it just
does not work I know the lights are kind
of
I'm washing it out but it just does not
work the formula just didn't do much for
me also that one's going to go it makes
me sad because those are like two really
expensive products this cover effects
these custom cover drops are I got them
like as a sample from Sephora like with
points but it's way too dark I don't
even know it's a 6 feet 11 I don't know
I don't know if that's actually the
shape but it's just a little bit too
dark for me but I like the idea of it
it's been fun to try so I'm going to
keep it because I want to remember like
if that is the shade I want to get these
for real but I want them a little bit
lighter because then I could like add
lightening drops to like maybe this and
make it work but I love that's pretty
that's so wrong for me though I don't
know if it'll work this is the Revlon
Colorstay in 250 it's their normal to
dry which is my favorite formula I love
this stuff off real fast way too much
foundation on my hand my hand looks so
beautiful
Bulova willful wonderful alright so this
one I actually really do like the shade
on me it is a little bit deeper I was
wearing it more like in the summer time
but I see I see it a little bit too dark
though and I think even on my face my
face is much much paler than the rest of
my body but if this is the rest of my
body I think it still might be too dark
so maybe I think I might pass this on
just because it is and I need to get one
maybe like 2:30 I'm struggling to find a
good shade because I used 150 buff for a
very long time because it has kind of
that gray tone that I really like on my
skin but I feel like it's just a little
bit wrong but I can't find anything
right because all of these numbers mean
nothing because the undertones are all
so different and I'm just struggling to
find a really good match so if you know
your skin tone is really close to mine
tell me below what are you wearing
Revlon Colorstay I'm so curious but I'm
going to pass it on okay so the bare
minerals complexion rescue is actually
really nice I was prepared to not like
it at all
it's kind of like a you know a BB cream
type thing
I was surprised how much I liked it it
blends to match it's really nice it
doesn't have super high covers but it's
not super low either but again it's just
kind of another BB cream where you know
it's almost as good as the other two I
love but not quite so if I fold my keep
it but I do like it and not doing a
great job on this you guys I have to
admit let me think about this one the
visible West blur this is actually like
this - it's in creamy natural it's kind
of more of like a gray tone am I
remembering correctly yeah it really is
it's a very neutral tone it matches my
skin really really well
that was why I liked it so I am going to
keep this and I liked it was kind of a
very kind of again like a satin finish
it wasn't a super map it wasn't super
glowy either and that's what I liked and
I love that it's in a squeezy - so I'm
going to keep the Hat this gorgeous
cosmetics one is one of my all-time
favorites this is in one in bbp and I've
had this for so long I really like it
but I think it just might be time you
know what I mean I've had it for so long
I had a backup as well but it's gotta be
getting pretty old and I think it's just
time so I'm going to pass that one on
the L'Oreal infallible pro gloves I
really like but I need to find a shade
that I want so this one's in 205 natural
beige oh it is just filling out that is
the one problem with these for some
reason they just like ooze out this was
in 207 sand beige so one is much more
yellow tone than the other which you can
see so mmm oh no so I definitely need to
get rid of 205 that's like yellow this
could be I'm thinking I might keep but
even still you can see it kind of
oxidizing they're just neither one of
them are right that's just the reality
and I had one before that was too light
and I actually like the formula but the
colors are just both so wrong for me so
I'm going to clean these up and pass
these on to someone that actually is
that tone so they can enjoy it oh my
gosh this is just oozing out so they can
enjoy it and actually
use it and you know what I mean because
there's no point me keeping them they're
both totally wrong for me so I will
passes on good good good good so that
leaves me with my bare minerals
conundrum I think I'm gonna hold onto it
because it's the only actual light cover
it's more like a tinted moisturizer than
like those BB creams actually have a lot
of this is the only thing that has very
low coverage just for a quick day if I'm
just going grocery shopping and I want
to pull my skin together it's the only
one I'm keeping the only other one that
was similar was this one and so I feel
like well I can just pass this one on
and keep the bare minerals that's the
one I genuinely like a little bit more
so okay so this is everything I'm
keeping that's what I'm getting rid of
not my greatest but I keep looking
through this and I'm like there's
nothing I don't want to keep though you
know what I mean so that I guess that's
a good sign that I really kind of narrow
down and these really are products that
I love but at the same time I don't know
why for me I don't know what's wrong
with me mentally that I feel frustrated
when I don't get rid of that much but
again it really should be a good sign
for myself that I'm getting better at
really narrowing down what I like
so as I'm declutter and more and more I
guess I'm declaring a little bit less if
you're wanting to see me declutter way
more than this you should watch my blush
one in my bronzer one I get rid of half
of my collection but even still I get
rid of seven foundations and two of them
actually three of them are really
expensive nice ones
and then three of them are just the
wrong shade I still like the formula but
all of these are amazing I would
recommend any the one Sun keeping
they're really really good other than
that I hope you'll subscribe to catch my
Futurity clutters I've got a ton coming
up and I'm filming right now today and
if you haven't seen my past ones I've
been doing these for years I do I'm like
twice a year with my whole collection so
I have a playlist of tons of them if you
are in that kind of a mood I will link
it below you can watch a tough enough
them other than that I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
