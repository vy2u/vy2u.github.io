another PR haul I feel like these videos
get such mixed reviews because some of
you guys love them and some of you guys
don't
oh I don't I'm so kind of torn I'm like
should I keep doing them but a lot of
it's like seeing them the downside to PR
hauls is this is an unboxing so I
haven't tried most of these products
they're new so there's not a lot of
value to them when it comes to reviewing
products letting you guys know how they
work
recommending products so it has no value
when it comes to that but it's kind of
more of an entertainment value at least
for me when I watch these I'm just more
entertained to see what's new out there
I just like watching them I don't know
so if you get it and that's why you're
watching this I think that's what coming
years like them I think some of you guys
just don't because like I said there's
not any value when it comes to reviewing
things because I'm not reviewing them
unless I just happen to have tried them
so let me know if you enjoyed this by
giving it a thumbs up so I know I don't
have to keep making these but a lot of
you guys are loving them and that's why
I'm continuing so they are fun to film I
have to admit it by just opening a bunch
of stuff with some girlfriends so let's
go and get into it so first package is
from L'Oreal and try to cut everything
open at least so I don't have to do a
lot of cutting on here to ends up taking
a lot of in line get this out okay so it
is a black okay okay there's a little J
up there
that's so cute so this is their
voluminous foundation films a lot of
video say this is their voluminous
mascara and I love this I haven't tried
it in years but it was like my favor for
the longest time then I have tried their
voluminous primer and it's pretty good
I've not tried their blue but looks like
they genuinely like dip these suckers
and glitter and then they put a J on
there for Jessica or GM V or whatever
that's awesome so I am so excited of
course the presentations ridiculous I
love it but I'm actually I actually am
excited to have this again because I
forgot how much I love them okay so the
next one I don't know who it's from
Oh L think I have a couple from ELF this
is a festival season 1 so looks like at
this Atif huh got like a little t-shirt
oh it's like all the stress so it's got
like the back kind of cut out in time
this is desert chill fun what else looks
like there okay so this is the end of
this so it's a bag got a little
dreamcatcher on it in a little black
bandana fun little backpack oh I was
wondering about this this is their new
line of stuff it's the elf beauty shield
the packaging of course is so cool on
their dig lipstick that's fun so this is
their SPF 50 skin shielding moisturizer
and then they also sent their vitamin C
pollution prevention serum so that might
this serum might be nice to try out like
here it's like a daytime serum yes
lightweight and hydrating oh shoot okay
oh wow
it's like heavy glass packaging class
the elf and it's like got that kind of
holographic but kind of that rainbow
about that anyway so that is really nice
let's see the packaging on this elf is
constantly stepping up their game
constantly amazes me this feels really
nice too so it is there oh this is their
moisturizer these are nice so there's
more to this line they also have their
beauty shield dual defense cleansing
face brush and then their daily defense
makeup mist what else I'm so excited oh
they're massage overnight recovery cream
so it looks like there's little roller
balls like metal on so they got some
little like rhinestones body art oh
there's more glow sticks fun I'll give
these to my nieces and nephews biggle
love it anyway so that was really cool
cute of course all Flair just so cute
but I'm to be honest out of all of these
I'm really excited about the moisturizer
in the serum elf has some cool skin care
brushes I haven't tried this one but
like they have a mask applicator and
it's great because if you've got like a
jar of a mask for example today was
problem with this glossier one
well you're dipping your hands in there
watching it all over your face but they
have an applicator where you dip it in
there kind of rubber in you can put it
all over your face that way and that's
awesome because then you're not giving
your face
over and over again next who is for
power glass so they've got this really
nice like brown box think they're good
for organizing boxes oh my gosh I just
saw a picture of what it is I'm like
freaking out right now okay
so it's there ambient oh my gosh there
ambient strobe lighting blushes and
their ambient lighting bronzers oh my
gosh I'm so excited so these things are
freaking pricey but they're amazing and
so I've got like their ambient lighting
powders I put them all over my face they
make my facebook so glowy and nice and I
love their blush as well so I'm excited
so the difference that these are they're
strobe lighting blushes since it
combines the illuminating effects of
ambient strobe lighting powders with
breathtakingly modern cheeses to
instantly brighten sheets for seamless
glowing and lit from within that's the
thing about their products they always
make you look like you're lit from
within and I think that's why I love
them so this one is in the shade oh my
gosh iridescent flash excellent in
brilliant nude and this one's even more
it's like very peachy does have some
glitter in it which a lot of their
strobe lighting products do have like
glitter in it the next one is euphoric
fusion and this one has a much more
berry tone but again it does have that
glitter in it so it really depends on if
you like glitter on your cheeks like
that or not I know some people love it
some people hate it I'm somewhere in the
middle it really just depends like once
you put it on does it look good or not
because some of them do not look good so
they also sent their ambient lighting
blush in incandescent electrode lighting
blush at least it doesn't say that so
this must be maybe a new shade Wow
so let me wipe these off let's do their
bronzers so this first ones in luminous
bronze light and it's a really
definitely a more orange e toned bronzer
again these have that kind of glowy feel
to them this is not glittery these are
not glittery ones but they're just glowy
and they make you look so your skin
looks so healthy the next one's nude
bronze light this one is much lighter
than that last one so if you've got a
really fair skin
this would look beautiful the next one's
in radiant bronze light again it's it's
a lot orange a year but it definitely
has a little bit more shimmer to this
one and the last one is diffused bronze
light this might be my favorite one it's
almost a rosy tone I don't want to say
rosy but it is a different tone than the
other three and this one seems almost
the creamiest once you actually put it
on but these are all so beautifully
finely milled they stay on your face all
day they just add glow so all over on
because I can talk about these for a
long time but these are so beautiful I'm
so excited to try these the next things
from it cosmetics so it's their
confidence in your glow skin
transforming healthy flush blushing
bronzer so these are three different
shades so the packaging is quite it to
do it's a it's like cardboard packaging
with glossy cardboard but they I mean
wow these are like these are big a but
it's just kind of cool all have these
this kind of ombre effect to them and so
I'm sure if you wanted to target your
brush and just a certain part of it
that's the idea so you can get all three
separately but you can also mix all
three which is what that top swatch is
these are definitely glowy but there's
not really glitter in any of them which
I appreciate they're just kind of more
shimmery
here my skin tone the best one for you
will be instant news glow which is the
one I just showed the swatches on if you
have a deepest skin tone
you probably want the instant warm glow
and then maybe medium instant natural
glow so you sound really cool I'll have
to let you know usually a cosmetics
based products stay on all day so these
will probably be I'll let you guys know
so they also sent their heavenly skin
one sweet wonder brush groundbreaking
sets pairs perfectly with any of your
two cosmetic stuff brush hairs and fuse
with anti-aging collagen I mean what
what is the brush that's kind of silly I
mean how is that going to apply that's
just kind of dumb to me anyway sorry I'm
a skeptic apparently so
it improves the look of your skin
immediately custom
brush had optically blurs and perfects
look at skin I could see how like
applying this to your skin with it could
look really pretty again I'll have to
let you know I'm a little skeptical but
I'm interested to try it
next thing is from fresh so they're
excited to share their latest Rose
launch it's infused with real rose
petals alcohol-free whoo nice the roads
deep hydration facial toner refines for
soften skins increases hydration awesome
so I'm intrigued just by that cute
packaging again they know we're suckers
from packaging all right so we've got
two products this is their fresh rose
face mask says it hydrates and tones
visit one that you put on a wash off or
yes you do rinse it so it says apply to
cleanse cleanse moist skin avoid the eye
area leave on five to ten minutes rinse
with water can be used daily I'm really
loving my it's from Korres but it
Sakura's like sleeping facial that you
put on and sleep with and usually no I
love that and I wish more companies had
sleeping facial so you don't have to I
mean I guess it's like putting on serums
and things but even still like the idea
of it is so smart anyway so they always
have really nice like glass type
packaging but the next thing is they're
the hydration facial toner
I actually am in need of a toner
currently Wow
there are legit rose petals in here I
did not expect that that is so cool
so this I am so so excited it says rose
fruit extract is no bird it's toning
properties rose water helps soothe rose
flower oil helps nourish Angelica leaf
extract is known to help retain moisture
does anyone when you hear Angelica you
think of Angelica from the rugrat that
little brat that loved cookies anyway
who wouldn't have hyaluronic acid which
I love helps attract and maintain
moisture to enhance suppleness so as you
can use it twice a day morning and night
just gently shoes over the face with a
cotton pad you could also use your
fingertips in sets so I am very excited
and very intrigued to try these I'll let
you guys know how I like them next is
from origins perfect war
have some of the stuff for a little
while all right
what's in your perfect world that is
your skin world just got more perfect oh
my gosh so we got some oranges products
and a camera
it says insects many cameras I know I've
seen a lot of people use is this real
hey I don't even have that film oh my
gosh so that's amazing I'm not sure how
this relates to this but I am so excited
I hug who's gonna be excited to play
this - that is so cool and so fun Thanks
origen I can't wait to play with this so
Wow
but also so it comes with their origins
a perfect world SPF 40 that is awesome
so we're getting into summer we're going
to be traveling to Ireland in Barcelona
soon and like a month we're also moving
we bought a house and anyway
so I need a really good at PS this is
1.7 ounces so I could fit this in my
carry-on because we're planning on
carrying on that is awesome it also says
aged defense it has white tee I'm
excited so that's probably what I will
bring they also have their perfect world
age defense treatment lotion with white
tee motion like a toner helps around
skin in an age defending protected
bubble it hydrates dry skin it leaves
skin soft and prepare for treatments -
follows alcohol-free oil-free AM and PM
so it is kind of it's a toner and it
also comes with their antioxidant
cleanser with white tea ooh I used a
white tea like sheet mask a day and my
skin looked awesome after it so I'm
thinking my skin might really like white
tea and now the offenses all of this has
that this is their age defense eye cream
with white tea and it has sunscreen in
it as well
SPF 20 that's pretty awesome so I'll
probably bring this as well it's really
small and it says just apply in the a.m.
so it's not necessarily meant to be a PM
cream considering has SPF but I'm
excited about the cleanser it's a
foaming face wash which is my favorite
um dirt grabbing minerals combined with
gentle skin compatible cleansing action
of palm coconut and oat amino acid reach
deep to help detoxify and free skin of
harmful impurities before they settle
and ruin your skin that's not what it
says but that's the gist so that is
amazing I'm so excited to try that line
as well and it's kind of perfect timing
when it comes to like season wise to
give a lot of this has SPF in it all
right let's keep chugging along this one
you don't know who it's from
oh butter LONDON so oh my gosh I saw
these on snapchat and I was like what I
need those so do you remember the pure
eye glosses that have like the little
sponge and it's like kind of a creamy
gel like cream eyeshadow but you had to
go through the sponge to get it well I
saw these on some a snapchat and I was
like it looks like that but without the
sponge so these are their eye glosses
this one is in moonshine so it's a
little pot you open it yeah and it's
just like this creamy moosie
almost looks like pudding but look at
the color it is so ridiculous it's so
pretty
so shimmery glimmery there's a little
bit of glitter to it oh my gosh
this is one of those things this is one
of those things I could see myself
wearing all the time just alone straight
up on my eyelid that's it nothing else
needed what else what else is in here
first of all look at this cute makeup
bag oh my gosh it's so pretty but they
have that Easter Egg grass kind of stuff
and it makes me crazy a lot of the
brains do it because it's great packing
material but it sucks to get up off the
carpet it's Nokia love my missus alright
so I've also got the shade icing I am
opening this like a frickin monster I'm
not even trying I'm too excited because
this looks like what I'm going to like
it more like a rose gold oh my gosh
she's like a bronzy oh so beautiful so
holy cannoli the other one they sent is
in where's the shade mermaid it's like a
greenish bluish oh my gosh this is so
ridiculous it just jumped to the top of
my list to try I cannot wait to see what
these look like on the eyes that is
amazing so they also sent their glazed
in lustrous liners so they sent like a
navy blue a purple
Brown bronze and then a black yes so
these do have glitter in them I also
when I wipe those swatches off they're
still glitter all over mine in front but
these themselves they have glitter in
them but it's in a way where it doesn't
look silly it actually just looks really
nice
so these are really really pretty I'll
have to let you know on the stain powder
once powder I'm losing my mind power
once I've actually worn them to see like
you know did they actually stay on all
day but I'm really excited about this
mostly this make it back I'm really so I
got this giant oh my gosh wooden box
from L'Oreal it was in another box I'd
open it
it's um a giant wooden one let me see if
I can open it I might be a focus sorry
why this is ridiculous they're not
hurting myself on all that the same
drusilla sebaceous okay alright so I
have to turn to the side hmm it looks
like a new haircare line it's their ever
fresh ever pure ever cream ever a curl
whoever curls so it's all excuse me in
here I wish I mean I can kinda show it
you guys we're going to make a mess but
a pretty cool box so first when I'm
pulling out is there ever pure volume
shampoo and conditioner said it has
lightweight fullness anti-fade UV
filters natural botanicals so excited to
give that a tribe away I'm going to be
set for a while aren't I they're also
acute like flowers in it and stuff like
on that outside of the packaging which
is hard to show L'Oreal L'Oreal is too
much with their PR like they were the
ones that sent their clay shampoo
conditioner which I'm using right now by
the way and it's really good but they
sent it in like a clay ball with amount
that you had to get out of it you had to
break the clay ball to get to the actual
chamber it was too much I loved it but
it was ridiculous anyway so the next one
is the ever curl sulfate free hydro
charred shampoo and conditioner with
coconut oil anti frizz definition
non-drying I will absolutely use this
because you guys know my hair is
naturally curly wavy and I'm always
looking for a good
and conditioner for the next is there
ever cream deep nourished conditioner
with Africa oil they also sent their
ever pure moisture shampoo and
conditioner so the other ever pure one
and the purple want to see volume this
one's for moisture and it has rosemary
in it and then they also sent their ever
fresh balancing conditioner and their
anti dandruff shampoo
they also said their micro exfoliating
scrub with apricot seed and it gently
removes flaky build-up I've never
thought of using a scrub with my hair so
I'm intrigued and they also sent their
ever cream re nourishing butter so it
restores softness and moisture I presume
this is like a em yeah it's a leave you
leave it on for three or five minutes as
a deep conditioner and then you rinse it
thoroughly it says you can use it weekly
or as needed next kids from Jake at
beauty this video is gonna be so long
cute package little piece bag so they
have o some of their baked highlighters
I tried one of them I think I remember
really liking it but they have three new
shades of their you glow girl baked
highlighters these are these result for
nine dollars each oh yeah I did really
like the one I have so they sent me
crystal sand which looks like it's kind
of an ivory wow oh my gosh beautiful so
it's kind of like an ivory but like a
baby ivory coat and they also sent Bella
Rose which is first of all it's a little
rose like a 3d rose oh my gosh oh my
gosh this is like a pinky tone highlight
these are ridiculous so these were
actually very smooth I think they've
improved the formula even more these are
waste with it they don't kick up powder
feel like the last one kicked up some
power I still really liked it but I feel
like the form is even better on these
two new shades so Wow next thing is from
Annie's cosmetic the smarter way to
remove nail polish so it's it spray away
nail okay nail eight is a brand it's
three different sprays and it's a spray
nail polish remover so this leak and
spill proof two times faster removable
non-drying no white residue so they have
this one with it which is keratin and
cocoa butter they also have hyaluronic
and call
again and then this one has ceramide and
coconut oil so this one for dry and
brittle nails this one's for splitting
and peeling nails and then this one's
for thin week now so really my nails
could use all of that so that's awesome
so I think you literally spray it on oh
you spray on a cotton ball or pad press
it over the nail and swipe from cuticle
to tip wash hands thoroughly cruelty
free do not spray directly on the nails
I would have prayed it directly on the
nail so I'm glad I read that um so I
mean I guess it's nice that it doesn't
leak but if it's like the same stuff
it's saying that it may be better for
your nails so I guess we'll see but I'm
definitely intrigued to try these next
thing is from Kiev kie s qu e and it's
liquid cow's it easy oh there are these
easy peel polish barricades so you it's
a it's a liquid you put on but it dries
and you can peel it off so you could put
it on around your nail so that it
doesn't get anywhere on your skin around
your nails or if you're wanting to do
like some like this is a French manicure
once you could put across the tip if you
wanted to do a different color to fit
things like that so that's pretty cool I
am so intrigued by these so I'm
definitely going to give these a try
this next one smells amazing it's from
sky organics and it's their organics
bath bombs gift set it smelled
unbelievable oh my gosh let me cut this
open oh my gosh so there are six bath
bombs I'm like in need of new bath bombs
too so this is perfect there's the love
potion bath bomb oh my gosh these smells
so freakin good the Caribbean coconut
bath bomb the lavender lemon muffins
bath bomb the mermaid kiss that's cute
the strawberry milkshake and then the
sixth one is the sugar rose bath bomb
okay the last thing I think I hope I
mean not that I hope it's up but I mean
I'm like nerve
fine forgetting some things this is
another one from elf because the other
one was from a while ago and this one
was more recently sent so it's funny I
always end up going to buy something and
then they send it to me and I'm like
cool already Bobby
so spring some of their new stuff so I
never tried any of their lashes so I
will try these these are their winged
and bold luck slash kit they said a cute
little Allah mints bandana that's
actually really cute they sent their
beautifully bear liquid highlighter
which I actually just bought and I
really really liked they oh my gosh yes
I'm all about their long lasting
luscious eyeshadows Suarez one of my
favorites so now I have a new one they
sent their teal cream eyeliner they sent
two of their tinted lip oils which I
love these are so comfortable I don't
think I tried berry kiss though I know I
have coral kiss and then they're
contouring blush and bronzer powder and
Saint Lucia for Lucia I would say that
on Saint Lucia so that's pretty awesome
just kidding there's one more this is
from tweezer men they sent there it's a
twee German brush IQ it's their mini
face contour brush set but it also comes
with their sponge I've never heard
anyone talk about this fun so I'm very
intrigued to give this a try the brushes
feel pretty soft a little bit dense for
my liking this feels really does too but
you never know until you wet it so I'll
have to let you know about that but they
also sent this like whole brush felt
kind of a thing that's kind of fun and
I'm our own one of those so they've got
a looks like a lot of their brushes some
of their eye brushes mmm this feels nice
so they're giant like powder brush
that'd be great that'd be great for body
bronzing so lot to let you know so that
was everything from this PR haul I've
got a lot to clean up a lot to try out
and let you guys know how I like it
