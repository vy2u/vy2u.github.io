going to share with you guys a huge PR
haul I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
things to open with you guys from
different companies so let's go ahead
and get into it so the first thing okay
let me be real some of these I already
opened because I'm not used to saving
these things for videos so I'm still
like training myself to know but it is
like Christmas and it's like waiting
hours before being allowed to go down
like I remember waking my parents up and
it might have but we need to make coffee
before you can go downstairs into your
presence and we need to I need to brush
my teeth
and I need I'm like oh my gosh come on
that's how I feel about these are like
dying to open some so this is one of the
couple things that I already got rid of
like the box I was like oh wait I forgot
I would show you guys so this is from
Bree OG oh and I've done a video with
them in the past
of course this video is not sponsored by
them it's just PR anyway so it's their
new line of scalp revival products so
they have their scalp revival charcoal
and coconut oil micro exfoliate attempt
I currently have one of these types of
things in my shower I love it it's their
it's their deep conditioner and I love
that stuff umm and then it also has
their scalp revival charcoal and biotin
dry shampoo and it looks I'm like
nervous oh oh it did you guys see that
see you squeeze it in it comes out that
way like that anyway that is awesome it
smells good it is all over the place now
is enough iced tea yeah you don't push
it down you squeeze it oh there it goes
anyway so that's that's pretty cool I'll
turn it up and then the last thing in
the line is their charcoal and tea tree
umm scalp treatment so it looks like you
put it into your hair one two drops to
each partition so you're kind of
partitioning your hair massage into your
scalp you do not rinse it out and says
you should apply this before no you
should apply this after washing and
before styling it can also be applied
for for bedtime as a pre shampoo scalp
treatment so if you've got any issues
like that I don't have really any issues
like that but um
I kind of want to try it anyway just you
know I want to have a really healthy
scalp next thing is from Clinique and
they sent this really cute bag this is
their what does it say it was there um I
promise I'm getting two things I have an
open I promise but this I did open and
it there may see the gifts with purchase
so these are all things from March 28th
through April 15th so it's really
getting close to the end there it's by
the time you're watching it might even
be pasión but if they're gifts with
purchase so it's a bunch of different
things these are so cute so this is a
little trio defective the blush and some
eye shadow in like mink is this little
duo this I will totally travel with this
is their dramatically different
moisturizing lotion this stuff is
amazing it really is amazing and I
always forget how good it is until I try
it again and I'm like oh yeah so good if
you've got dry skin you would love it
and then they have their rinse off
foaming cleanser I've never tried that I
liked it it's calming I like foaming
thing so you my weird like that are you
guys filming oh this is the Moisture
Surge extended thirst relief it's ready
to open oh yes and it just it's like
this like gel and I'm assuming it's like
a yeah I mean it's like a moisturizer oh
my gosh it feels so good this is a great
way to try these more expensive products
without like straight-up buying a
full-size and just gambling that you'll
like it or that your skin will like it
it also came with two other things this
lipstick in ginger flower ooh it's a
little bit more I mean it's certainly
pigmented but it is more of like a sheer
kind of color but this is such a pretty
spring color very puffy and then also
there chubby lash which I actually
already have one of these if they're
fattening like volumizing mascara I've
actually heard really good things so I'm
excited to give that a try
last thing that I've actually already
open and everything else is not this is
from Lily England and the bag is so cute
just like this white like soft leather
type feel to it and the note inside says
TRAI are cruelty free Lilla england rose
told-- makeup brush set and their handle
is at Lily England UK awesome so there
are five brushes they're really cute so
they're all white with like the rose
gold ferrule and they're really soft so
this one looks like a good actually this
is probably great for bronzer it's small
enough but big enough you know if I mean
iam this is a like a foundation type
brush I've been applying primer from
time to time it's this kind of brush I
don't like doing foundations that kind
of a brush then it looks like there are
three eye brushes this one looks like
it'd be really good small maybe packing
on to the lid this one's like a pencil
brush who I will definitely use that
these do feel really well made I like
using this on my lower lash line and
then yes I can always use a great
eyeliner brush for like my gel liner
it's like a little angled brush so I am
very excited about these next little box
from my party there a note yes I just uh
our latest applicator the makeup drop
you won't waste a drop of makeup anymore
I'm already excited looks like there's
two of them I wonder say the same thing
oh it's one of the like silicone one I
have not ever tried those I know I've
seen a few youtubers on here try it oh
it does feel weird
do you like take it out there's like a
thing or no I think that's it oh it says
do not puncture it don't use it if it's
punctured apply a small amount of makeup
directly to the makeup drop using soft
circle motions blend makeup onto the
skin I want to try it on my hands when I
try it with my light wet well so to
focus I'm just going to do it on my hand
here this is way too much oh I can't win
yeah I mean it's definitely not wasting
any because obviously there's nothing
for it to like get sucked inside of
I needed doing a pretty good job I would
have to liken this to doing it with your
hands in a way because it's not really
getting sucked into your hands
I mean maybe keeps a little bit of the
oil but that same idea where you know
for me I thought how could this possibly
work but I guess it does make sense
because it'll work you know when you do
it with your hands but it's working
surprisingly well I'll have to actually
try it on my face and let you guys know
and of course the cleanup is like wipe
wipe wipe done probably rinse it off if
you want to says restore see is the
brand there's all in here but this is
well it's the 24 karat liquid gold face
oil lot and then this one is repairing
hand treatment oh my hands are crazy
right now oh this is the same PR firm
that sent the drunk elephant stuff which
I so I'm not trying i've got like so
much future up trying right now I'm like
overwhelmed but I'm loving it because it
is so fun to try all that stuff and let
you guys know about them so I'm excited
about the restore see stuff I'm just
I've never heard that brand and then oh
it's new on stuff so it's the Salma
Hayek brand some of this stuff I have
tried some of that I have not but like
this they sent their naturally luminous
concealer might be a little darkest and
medium they also sent some lip products
there's I think I've tried both of these
the nuance lipstick in baby's breath
pink and then this oh I like this this
was there plumping liquid lipstick in
mulled wine I think that's what I had
maybe I had more of a red tone but it
was really really pigmented so I was
really impressed with that but they also
sent their volumizing mascara and I'm
excited try this their tinted brow gel
and Universal Brown so that's pretty
cool it says it combs and sets brows for
a defined natural look oh they said
another their concealer in light
yay it looks like it's got a like oh
it's okay it's got like a furry but firm
tip and you push the bottom okay I'm
going to do that for about two
I'm not going to keep doing it I'll have
to work on it later but I am definitely
intrigued to try and they also sent
their shadow palette which I actually
already own this and I remember being
pretty good but I wasn't like crazy
impressed with it so I might keep this
in the box maybe see if a sister wants
to get a try and plus I just have so
many colors like this I was just like
weak but I'm excited to try their
mascaras their brows things especially
those concealers and then there's
another product it's another restore see
lip magic what is it after 15 oh it's
like a treatment game after 15 days see
softer smoother plumper looking lips it
can be worn alone or under your favorite
lipstick it's like a balm but it's
liquefied but it's not glossy I don't
know how to describe that but it feels
really soft and I am totally in for
trying that so I'm excited alright
moving on next one this is from
physicians below me alone they sent me
something a long time ago but I feel
like I haven't gotten anything from them
in a while and I love the mission's
formula okay so this is adorable it's
like a little bag some people are so
extra since we hope you'll enjoy trying
out the new cushion corrector and primer
duo's I almost bought these the other
day oh my gosh this is awesome so it's
their mineral where these just look so
intriguing their mineral wear cushion
corrector and primer do it so this one's
yellow and green this one is peach and
lavender and it has SPF of 20 sunscreen
it's recommended by the Skin Cancer
Foundation that's pretty cool so it says
like the yellow corrects dark circles
and dullness the green corrects redness
and then on this one the teach brightens
darkness the lavender brightens dullness
oh okay I wondered how you'd be able to
like if you wanted to only apply one
like how you do that so comes with a
little paddle like they're butter
bronzer does but one side is one of the
colors and the other the other so like
any time wanting to do just the purple I
can make sure I'm using the purple side
so that was smart because I thought it'd
be like a round cushion I'm like how are
you going to control like what you're
getting out wow I mean they really are
like correcting like they're it's like
legitimate oh that is so cool
now I want to try the green in the
yellow Wow so these are legitimately
like I said I thought they'd be kind of
not pigmented but they are I mean these
are like genuinely correctors so that is
really exciting to me really exciting to
me and again the same one had the green
in the yellow on each side or the two
different colors on the two sides well
you still have 1 2 3 4 5 more boxes it's
from milk makeup which is very exciting
to me because I love their blur stick
and I love their icing well this is the
milk makeup Mars holographic stick oh my
gosh it says it's a hyper golden peach
highlighter packed with moisturizing
mango butter peach nectar and avocado
oil for an out-of-this-world Sheen I am
already so excited oh my gosh it's so
pretty it's so like how do I explain it
if you look in film like mine it totally
blends in but then when the light
catches it it really is like holographic
in that way almost pulls like purplish
and it reminds me of their other
holographic stick that is so so
beautiful that is so exciting and it's
set okay it's got oh so cute um my
sunglasses from the brand allah siva and
let's save all these are fun oh my gosh
aren't those crazy i don't know how they
look on my face shape that is fun i like
how there's like no bar there it's just
like more of the sunglass these are
beautiful I feel like this is a little
bit more wearable for me than the
original holographic stick that one it's
just I can still wear it but this one is
like totally up my alley I am very
excited now might be love is no Beauty
they are always so good to me and I love
them so much and I use nug masks like
every single week without fail often
I travel with them if I'm going to be
gone for more than a couple days because
I can get like two uses out of it and
they're so small oh my gosh I love them
so this is their subscription box for
dry skin that's awesome it says dry skin
needs regular exfoliation and in ten
and effective hydration in order to
bring back its natural moisture balance
make the skin dewy and smooth this
monthly box that offers the face masks
you need four for that in a gentle and
natural form and that's why I love that
it really is gentle but it still works
like it's not so gentle that's not
working you know okay so in here
came for okay eight max total so for a
be hydrating mask and then for the
exfoliating mask even my husband uses be
so I'm so excited people definitely get
used alright next don't know where this
is from if they edit I've been kind of
hit or miss with them and it's not
usually that the product itself has been
bad it's usually that the shade was just
really wrong so I would pass it on
because it wasn't right for in skin type
so first of all this girl on here is
gorgeous so there's some new products
okay I'm so excited so first thing in
here I see is this flash illuminator now
I've gotten one of these before
oh there's three of them okay and
they're in three different shades so
there's shade number one which is
spotlight and these like if I remember
correct I you could mix it with your
foundation you could use as the target
and highlighter you can put it on under
your foundation okay you can do the non
toward glow so you could use like the
darker shade night light and you could
put it where you'd normally contour and
it's just going to deepen it but it's
still like glowy and pretty actually
that would be cool so this is the
lightest one it's like truly a white so
actually if you wanted to like lighten
your foundation to while also adding
glow this might be perfect for that but
just a really pearly very pearly oh my
gosh she's just so pretty though and
then the next one up is shade number two
which is morning light looks like a
light gold yeah this is a really pretty
gold and that's really on my alley
and then the darkest one they sent is in
number five night light wow that is
definitely more bronzy it's going to
look so beautiful on kindom but I am
kind of intrigued to try that non toward
they mentioned I've never done that and
frankly never thought to do that Simon
I'm intrigued so those are really really
cool they also send the poor vanishing
moisturizer matte hydrator and primer
that's pretty cool
because I feel like you can only get
like a mattifying primer or a
moisturizing one and you can't get it
all in one so really I like the idea
that it's still hydrates but it blurs
your pores I don't really need to
control oil on my face but for me I do
still have pores that bother me so if I
could find a hydrating one that's still
like blurs pores
I am hunted to scent in so it feels like
gel like it doesn't have like that
silicone feel that a lot of the ones
that might be too drying on my skin do
it does feel moisturizes but it does
feel like baby smooth but it doesn't
have that velvety silicone field this is
the craziest I've never I'd never tried
anything like this
I am so like intrigued awesome so cannot
wait to use that tomorrow morning when I
picked it up and then the last thing in
here is their Flash illuminator fluid
powder in zero one heat I love their
packaging it's the same for their
bronzer they have that I love oh my gosh
so it's a powder highlight it is so like
light gold which I love again because
just my skin tone it just look looks the
best that is gorgeous
alright moving on to more I got for self
stuff boo brushes no way I was just
talking about this I was just filming a
video about the elf brush cleanser wipes
that I always travel with so then when
I'm putting my makeup brushes back in my
makeup bag to travel they're not all
dirty with like black eyeliner shadow
you know what I'm saying so I always
bring these these are like these
individually wrapped little wipes that
have brush cleanser on them and so I
usually just pop a few in my bag they
take up literally no room at all and
it's just so perfect for that and then
you just toss it so I'm excited to have
more of those
and they send a bunch of their precision
like they're beautifully precise line
and I think I have some of these but
some of them are like Holy Grail some
exciting Rebecca so for example this is
their precision eye shadow brush this
brush is my favorite for sculpting out
my brow bone I'll use like a white
shadow and just put it right under there
and for some reason it's always such a
perfect job so I'm excited to have
another one of those and I was just
talking about this brush this is the
eyebrow duo brush I use this brush with
my Anasazi ax dip brow pomade
it is amazing it's so perfect and
there's something about the fact that
this does have that that synthetic feel
but it's so perfect with that Tommy get
brushes I use this brush today to put it
on my brows and it just a such an
amazing job and this bully is really
good too and then they also sent their
smudge brush which is kind of like a
bigger pencil brush and then their
sculpting brush like if you wanted to
contour with and then their precision
eyeliner brush it's like a really
pointed one so I don't think I have this
one so I'm excited to have some more
though some of them to fire T have I'll
probably save it like I said for a
giveaway coming up okay
last box here alright tweezer men who
they make my favorite sweeteners like
truly the ones that have a little light
in them oh my gosh those are like a
total game changer for me so it's like a
whole bag of little goodies here ooh I
kind of needed a new eyelash curler
these are there oh this chisel tweeze
them in there's like a rose gold and
like a darker kind of steel gray pewter
maybe okay so the rose gold one is their
pro curl lash curler so it's effective
for most eyes shapes but ideal for round
eyes and then this one is their
Promaster lash curler for almond and
deep set eyes let's go I didn't know
they made different ones for different
shapes like I genuinely had no idea that
tweezer Minh do that so that is cool and
then they also have this whole like like
a brush roll of stuff so it looks like
they've got some of their tweezers in
here they have a lash comb I just bought
one of these from Sephora I love the I
use this every day
before I curl my lashes I brush my
lashes out because if you have any
residue from like I don't know the night
before or like especially if you wear
fake eyelashes the glue can sometimes
become stuck this will brush right
through and get that out of there
without like pulling out your lashes I
love things like this and I love that
it's pink so they've got a bunch of
different tweezers they have a is it
like a micro blade or like a little
razor that makes me so nervous I've seen
too many videos that people actually
shave them off for eyebrows oh my gosh
all kinds of stuff the little scissors a
little spoolie they even have some like
makeup products in here's their little
eye i enhanced brow definer eyeliner duo
highlighter duo they also have their
little brow mousse they have some
brushes a blush brush if you'll soft
flat top foundation but it's really
small but this might be really nice for
cream bronzer and actually that is
exactly how I'm going to try to use that
and then this contour concealer ooh like
rounded and then like a little brow
brush ooh that actually might be really
nice with this ability so and that'd be
good for like a pomade so all in all wow
