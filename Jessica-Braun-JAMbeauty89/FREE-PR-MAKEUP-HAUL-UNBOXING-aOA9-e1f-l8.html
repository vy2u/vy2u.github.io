my next PR Paul / unboxing these are
things that were sent to me from
different companies to do with what I
want but I've been showing them to you
guys because you guys seem to love it I
know I've been watching them on youtube
along too
I used to do this a long time ago called
P o box love but I kind of stop it does
get overwhelming in that I end up having
we live in a small apartment right now
and so I end up having a stack of boxes
and so that's where I kind of stopped
doing it but regardless they are really
fun so I'm going to try to keep doing
these from time to time as long as you
guys will still watch them I also we
have a lot of amazing brands just like
based on the who it's from on the box
I'm like oh my gosh so let's go and get
into it
so the first brand is tatcha now I have
a storied past with Tasha
I mean it's not that you're perfect but
I reviewed their luminizing spray their
dewy setting mists are not that's not
their dewy skin mist and I didn't really
like it not that it's a bad product but
that for my skin type it wasn't working
is too much but I know a lot of people
do like it well they contacted me
through Instagram and said that they
were so sorry that I didn't like it but
they'd love for me to try other products
theirs and I thought that is so classy
of them like I feel like some companies
the second I talk bad about them
one second anyone does they write them
off Spacek and off their PR list but you
know whatever it might be but I thought
they are so proud of their product and
they know they have so much good stuff
that they were like it's okay no not
everyone likes everything so they sent
me a bunch other stuff oh my gosh okay
these are some of these are things just
looking at it I almost bottom line this
is the touch of camellia gold bun lip
balm is it casting light set like this a
lot with her oh I ripped a bus enemy
response I know that doesn't really
matter but still so what I do know the
company is that they got a really cool
story just a general great company you
can tell they care about their product
holy moly so literally is in this
ridiculous luxurious packaging to open
it
oh my gosh I mean it's literally a clear
ball but they're like these gold flecks
in it I can't wait to use this so Wow
they also sent their luminous overnight
memory serum concentrate their luminous
deep hydration firming eye serum I don't
think I've ever used the serum that was
only for eyes that's pretty cool have I
their luminous deep hydration firming
serum firming this is this the one that
everyone's been talking about it's their
polished
gentle rice enzyme powders says for dry
skin Bingbing negging that's me that
reminded me of member the Amanda Show
and she would say that me anyway do you
actually holy moly
so it's a huge thing of powder it says
polishing skin to a luster lives at the
heart of the geishas daily ritual
preparing a perfectly smooth canvas for
her performance makeup the secret behind
is creamy water activated powder is a
blend of rice and the pie enzymes of it
releases debris from the skin instantly
revealing baby soft skin ready to
receive the benefits benefits of
treatment so sounds like you mix it with
water right oh my gosh
yes it's for half a teaspoon into wet
hand I have water create a creamy foam
massage onto a wet face for 10 to 20
seconds oh my gosh I cannot wait to try
this tonight
so that is awesome and then they also
sent their pure one-step camellia
cleansing oil and love cleansing oils
and they also sent their silk cream
weightless and anti-aging moisture rich
silk extracts so I am so excited to give
these a try
I'm like I said I just think that was
really cool of the brand and of course I
am so thankful and so so excited - Thank
You Sachi
and these two especially I want freak it
out about next is this package from
models own and I heard that they're
going to be sold like in the u.s. now
maybe they weren't before something like
that yes model zone from London British
are coming
awesome awesome awesome so they got some
new products are going to sent so they
sent some of their products that looks
like first one in here is this color
chrome eyeshadow palette packaging is
cool so it's like a rose gold packaging
it feels actually pretty nice it looks
like these are like cream shadows so
they're not super opaque I'm not sure if
they're supposed to be or not but they
definitely are not now you probably
could get a synthetic brush and really
build them up if you wanted to but like
if I wanted a base I guess I can die
we're going to put other stuff on top I
could see that too packaging though
that's the part that's killing me
beautiful finish is this luxe stick
velvet lipstick in velvet whispered
again cute packaging very bubblegum pink
nice for spring I hope necessarily
always wear that color but it felt
really creamy and pigmented so I'll have
to let you guys know and then this is
their sculpting glow highlighter stick
in moonlight so it's got this kind of
matte white lid with this cute bottom
part it has a nice Sheen to it it's not
too much but I actually this might this
is my favorite out of the three products
they sent so I'll have to try that out
maybe do a look with it and show you
guys but awesome I'm excited that
they're going to be here I'm always
excited to have more company here in the
US you know number seven yes number
seven I recently bought a bunch of their
stuff at Target why am i yelling and I
loved a lot of like their bronzer became
like holy grail for me in like 2.5
seconds so looks like they've got it all
in this cute like mesh black bag some of
the girls there's been talking about so
this is the one in golden sand I'm not
even to open it because I can save it
maybe for a giveaway but then they have
another one in caramel I don't even know
if I saw this in the store when I was
any other ones it's a much warmer tone
oh these are so pretty though there that
is beautiful oh my gosh
I am just in love with these I know my
friends happier on YouTube her channel's
shades of Cathy she really likes this as
well it is so so good what else do they
send some of their blushes I used to
have one of those I really liked it was
called soft humping but this one's in
peach velvet and it looks like this
really pretty peach color these aren't
pigmented comfortable to wear they stay
on this one bin danzón missed I feel
like the other one called soft dancin so
this one's a brighter kind of old coral
color they sent some of their lipsticks
to try their Thursday perfect lips fixed
and then they also have like there is
moisture rich right moisture drench and
I really like these I like them I have
one of these already I really like the
move this color is called honey bloom
though that is the prettiest but it's so
pretty that it's so so pretty and it's
the moisture dredge line I love over
there because it's so moisturizing
alright in the last few things they sent
their air brush away primer now I'm
currently trying out their stay perfect
foundation and I thought like the
lightest shade and then the next one up
I can't get the right shade I need to
buy another one anyway um but I've never
tried their primary didn't even know
they had one so I'm very excited to try
that and then they sent their yeah my
favorite their radiant glow under-eye
concealer this stuff is one of my Holy
Grail products it's this silver tube you
put it it's like a very it's like a
light lightly brightening under-eye
concealer it blends in in like seconds
you just brush it on it reminds me of
the YSL Touche claw concealer or
brightener but better it is genuinely
better and it's like half the price I
love these so Thank You number seven I
am so flipping excited if you can't tell
and it looks like they also have a
seven match-made skin tone analysis app
that's pretty cool alright moving on
next one and then it's really cool like
kind of unicorn life packaging classic
bullets from pure they are some new
products glow on the go that's festival
season there no filter primer which I
have this and love this so I will save
this for a giveaway and the bronzer
selfie liquid bronzer looks like there's
a shirt in your 200 it's like a tank
that's awesome it's going to be huge on
me so I will wear it for PJs that's so
fun though I love things like that so
cool love but so the no filter primary
let me grab mine first of all I love the
packaging I got mine through octal II
but it's they're blurring photography
primer it's a little dropper it's a very
glowy type of a primer you can put it on
underneath you can mix it in I like
wearing it underneath honestly but I
really really like it and it does blur a
little bit but I think it's more
illuminating than anything so I will
save that that's awesome and then the
bronze your selfie oh it's bigger than I
thought so is it like for your face your
body oh it's a face and body liquid
bronzer so it'd be the kind of thing
that you know it will come off like if
you're wearing a white dress I mean
think of it as makeup for your body it's
going to get onsen white dress but I
feel like I could mix that with other
things as well like I could mix it with
a lotion for my body if I wanted things
like that so that is pretty awesome and
the packaging is actually really kind of
cool oh it's from Avon we're in a Vaughn
Ben I used to love Avon like when we
would get a little holy moly little
catalog I would get so excited to look
through it like that's my mom can we buy
this we buy this and so like we would
both get something so pulled off all it
came in to make a bag it says makeup
nourishes the soul so it's got a bunch
of their Avon true color nourishing
lipsticks holy moly a lot of them and
then also some of their Yvonne true
color nourishing mascara oh but we've
got brown black black and then navy
that's kind of fun but these are these
cute little like rose gold like being on
the top as possible so I want to swatch
at least one of these lipsticks so we
can see the formula let me pick one that
I know would be totally at Macaulay so
it's got pretty nice packaging very
definitely moisturizing this reminds me
of the moisture drench line from number
seven really great pigmentation just
glided right on it's a thinner formula
which I don't mind because it still has
a lot of color to it so I think that's
actually pretty cool it'll probably wear
off a little bit better throughout the
day as well so that's exciting
yes Avon get your name out there again I
mean I feel like they're still out there
it's just like it's outside of the world
that I'm in right now I guess I don't
know it so I'm glad they're getting more
of a YouTube presence because I remember
always really liking all that stuff so
that is very exciting
okay so this is from Mac I think I know
what it is I was watching some friends
snap stories recently I'm pretty sure
yes it's Laura Lee's lipstick and
Gabriel Zamora and how exciting for them
I know they are so excited so this one
her shade is called Laurel arleigh and
yeah it's a really pretty
hers is from the matte it's the matte
formula they're really pretty neutral
definitely more of a cool almost grayish
tone and it's really pretty
I could totally picture that on her and
then his is a satin finish and it's
called Gabriel Zamora how cool at a
matte lipstick with your name on it like
you guys know my feelings on math
lipsticks they're just not my favorite I
have some that I still like and wear and
I still have them but I just feel like
it's hit or miss in how comfortable of
this to wear and how it wears off but
that's it this is much deeper more of a
brown tone both really pretty so that's
so exciting and I'm so excited
for them yeah all right next oh I play
an Easter basket by the time you are
watching it I'm sure Easter will be long
gone but that's so fun does happy spring
from your friends at Sally Beauty and it
has this little Etsy like makeup bag
that's cute and then Thomas e Luther
Canyon either kidding I want to race you
there we see in here that's all I care
about
so it looks like is this place to Etsy
their new spring line oh my gosh so this
is the shade playdate oh that's like
literally my favorite color right there
and then bikini so teeny also is not
your new spring line it's remember this
color ever and used to like be obsessed
with it
what else these are so cute for spring
high maintenance this is a famous one
too so these are actually some of their
like hip-hip slowly stretch this is
adorable food chocolate hope in the heat
a hot in the heat that's a pretty like
strawberry color and then ooh the clear
all-in-one baked so awesome because my
base coat my favorite formula excellent
that's being discontinued um if I want
to run out soon I'm gonna need one so
and I do I see formula it's really easy
to work with the kite I appreciate next
is from Paula's Choice can keep like
wrapped thing um you guys know I love
polishing I do very very much so
so they send me their Omega plus complex
here this is brand-new their products
really I mean you can trust that any
product they come out with it's good for
your skin like they know what they're
doing
got some heavy packaging but it says you
apply once or twice daily after
cleansing toning and exfoliating put a
few drops under your face neck and eye
area before moisturizing or use alone
for daytime always call with a sunscreen
so it says it's a hydrating powerhouse
oh yes of Omega rich ingredients that
keeps your skin healthy over
time it strengthens and protects your
skin's moisture barrier
flaxseed passionfruit chia olive oil it
neutralizes environmental damage by
strengthening skins delicate barrier
that is awesome
because I don't think we take into
account how much the elements affect I
mean I think we do but I mean it's so
our skin is just exposed to so much
nonsense
including the makeup we put on our faces
so I am quite excited about that next is
from Dermalogica and it's there to get
your Dermalogica glow on and it is their
final replenish oil and then our Hydra
blur primer which I do have this however
did they send it to me or did it come
from someone else or because I know that
I didn't like to buy it but we're here
I'll just show you the one eye open and
I'll save this one for giveaway
yeah I even came up a little thing to
make sure you squeeze it all out kind of
like you can use with toothpaste but I
tried it once that I really like that
and you just need to try it more it's
like hydrating but it's also blurring
and it was totally I don't know it's
like a totally different formula than
I've ever used very soft so awesome I
will save that but the photo replenish
oil it's a treatment oil rapidly absorbs
to reinforce the skin's protective
barrier so sounds kind of like a serum
right but that is so cool so so we okay
next thing is from ooh
one while I don't know anything from
them it says join our mega glow
highlighting powders from the queen of
my heart collection I have some of their
other ones I've been wanting to get my
hands on they're like the rainbow one
that they have out I can't find it
anywhere
these are like colored like legit and of
course these are limited edition holy
moly that is no joke that is genuinely
iridescent purple now it doesn't pack as
much of a punch as you might think but
the the punch is in that shimmer because
it's very almost holographic in a way
and then this pink one oh so the purple
was called lilac lilac
to reality and this one's the sweet it's
playing oh well to sweeter swing swing
swing
Oh music nerds out there probably
enjoyed that oh this one would be a
pretty this would actually work as a
highlighter for me I think the purple is
a little bit too out there or this would
be a really pretty blush topper and now
when I think packed a little bit more
pigment oh it's so pretty
tattoo junkie awesome I've never turned
the other stuff so there Libby so it's a
lip paint and then what do you put on so
there's like a pigment a loose pigment
you put on top so with just a lip paint
it's like a matte look and then if it
what if you want to look velvety that's
kind of cool you put on the power so
they sent a bunch of their colors they
also sent some like fake tattoo sheets
into little jewels as well but that's
awesome so the colors they sent this is
riot which is much more like pinky red
and then there's cheeky which is like a
classic nude and then bubblegum is like
kind of a mid-tone pink that's pretty
and then oh my gosh my friend Laura
might rock this this is in grunge that's
really cool so oh I see so the bubble
gum and cheeky do a velvet look with the
powder but when you add the powder for
riot it's more of a sparkle and then
it's a chroma look for the grunge one
when you add the pigment so that's
really intriguing I've never tried
anything like that so I know that was
long if you want to see my other PR haul
videos I will link the path to that I've
done I feel like I should do these a lot
which is a great thing that's awesome
but that means you need to see them a
lot so if you like them yes I hope that
you'll subscribe and definitely come say
hi on my social media otherwise I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
