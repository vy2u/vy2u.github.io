be that fit fun springbok how flipping
cute is this box I literally it came in
the mail and I was like oh my gosh like
it just literally prettiest part I've
ever seen that something was just mailed
in so I love that so all the details of
pricing and info and stuff will be below
know this video is not sponsored um as
most subscription box companies this one
is sent to me for free as well I can
show it on my channel I cannot show it
it's really up to me I like showing it
to you guys because I know a lot of you
guys like seeing these so that is why
I'm unboxing it here today and let's go
ahead and get it to it they gave me a
ten dollar off code if you'd like to use
it it's Jam beauty and I'll have that
listed below as well I'm just on the
regular farid fun website but let's get
started I'm so so excited it always
comes with like kind of like a mini
magazine of what you'll see inside and
it's always so cute it has stuff about
like some of the companies inside it's
something but the hell it's been three
years since they started which is always
exciting I can only imagine how exciting
for the company that this is as it as
they grow um awesome okay so let's dig
in I understand start on the top this is
a thirty dollar so it came with a
30-dollar sterling forever gift card
they always come look like a gift card
or two which i think is so cool because
that like alone kind of helps you meet
the monthly price which i think is
really really neat so this next thing is
a $25 gift card for 31 bits calm and it
looks like it's got like jewelry and
stuff so awesome okay what is this it
says so the first big thing I'm seeing
in here is this kitchen herb garden DIY
kit oh my gosh so it's got basil mint
and time my husband's gonna be so
excited but it looks like it's just a
box that says herbs on both sides is
definitely would
and it's got what you need inside as
well to grow them it's got three little
plastic pots and therefore it um I am so
excited about this this is the perfect
time in here you don't think spring
obviously that would be why but it gives
you directions as well on how to do it
so that is so awesome I have to say
that's the first time I received plants
in the mail other than like maybe
flowers you know alright so the next
thing in here is this hello legs says
for the softest shiniest sexiest
smoothest legs ever ladies you better
will honor your razors because your legs
will feel amazing after your next shave
so it's got a bunch of moisturizing
stuff so I'm just intrigued to try
especially again as we're going into
summer and we're starting with shorts
and dresses and skirts that sounds
awesome so I'll have to let you guys
know how this goes I just filmed this
video for my boxes from a tipsy video
and um I put I tried on one of the lip
things i'm wearing it but i swear the
little color gets darker like every five
minutes it's like a darker shade it's
really bizarre alright the next thing in
here is this ish is h contour kit i have
never heard of this brilliant of you so
it's just black and it just says ish on
the front there they're just they're
just um okay it's not like kind of like
the balm packaging where it's like thick
cardboard tight but it magnetizes that's
what it reminds me um it's got a big
mirror and then these are the shades in
there so it looks like there's like a
highlight of a blush and then two
different contour bronzer shades now
they're the contour shades really soft
actually that might be okay it's a
little warmer than I would typically go
but it's not that warm it's kind of
actually really nice let's try this
other shades it's a little bit lighter
it's got some shimmer to it so I they
kick up a lot of powder which again is
not the worst thing I said this a lot
lately it's not the worst thing when
something kicks up powder you just want
to be aware because if you don't tap off
your brush or whatever then you might
have fallout in places you don't want it
alright let's try the the blush is
bricked
yeah it does kick up a lot of powder
though um that's pretty bright that
might be too bright at least for me for
some it'll look gorgeous on you so I'm
now using my phone just watch the
highlight shade okay so I have that
shade nobody's this finger it looks
really pretty swatched on your finger
but then when you're actually put it on
your skin it like doesn't show up so I
think what the brush it will look better
obviously fingers aren't ideal for that
so um that's pretty cool that it's in
there and I it's a new brand to me which
is always exciting next thing I'm seeing
in here is this jus d'amour I don't know
I'm love song in a bath bomb bath bomb
Trinity huh yes three bad balls this is
adorable I will use this this is okay
this is pretty awesome I love I feel
like they shut about bombs like in every
single one because everyone loves
getting bubble baths bath bombs are the
bomb and they're kind of expensive so
this is such a luxurious treat they
should just do it every month this is
amazing so I am very excited about that
obviously now it is called bad fit fun
so they of course usually have a fitness
item inside it's the mats trap + so I'm
assuming you um yeah you would use it
till I hold your mat and be able to
carry it looks like it's like here we
are we're pulling it out well says it's
versatile yeah so you can hold it you
can also use it to exercise like for
stretching you can hook it onto your
foot and then pull it you know as you're
laying down but it'll also hold onto
your mat your yoga mat so that is pretty
cool I love that it's pink it's really
cute but again then it's nice that it's
versatile because if you're already
going to be carrying your yoga mat with
you it's nice that the carrier also
serves another purpose so that's pretty
cool the brand of this was Merrithew
alright next thing is this Marrakech oil
definitely a full-sized they always I
mean I feel like everything's always
full sized in this box argan and hemp
oil therapy hair styling elixir and it's
a pump up here um
our powerful blend of argan oil from
Morocco and hemp seed oil leaves hair
feeling silky smooth with a healthy
looking for his free glossy shine apply
a small amount too wet or dry hair and
style as usual suite has no drying
alcohols no parabens know glutens THD
propylene so sweet that's something I
will definitely use I typically use some
sort of oil for me since my hair is
thinner and it just Oh like lifeless um
I usually put it only in the lower areas
just because if I get anywhere higher
it's grease ball which is really the
case for a lot of people a lot of oils
you don't want to put too close to your
roots for obvious reasons Oh the next
thing in here is this little necklace it
says what's the brand zouk and Nona
happy dream love inspired San 18 karat
gold plated necklace and it's like a
little bar necklace but it says happy I
think that's really cute I will
definitely wear that I have a little
gold bar necklace I wear right now but I
feel like my words I know um cuz wearing
it last night actually but this I could
layer with it and I love it it's um
gold-plated just so it's not going to
get tarnish as easily or as quickly um
that is adorable so I'm really excited
about that the last thing in here is the
keratin walls and socks nail
strengthening moon and skin nourishing
so it's one pair of gloves of one pair
of socks by the brand body pure so you
slip them on you leave it on for 20
minutes because the cream will like
soaking them so it's kind of like a mask
for your face but it's like a mask for
your hands and feet yeah and then you of
course you throw it away so it's got
carrots in vitamin E co-pi but oil
copaiba oil um urea and lip ex pre-act
lie pecks Preetam never heard of that
one um that's pretty cool I can't say
I've ever tried anything like this but I
definitely will use it and try it
thinking we're running a marathon this
year and mini marathon it's a half
marathon calm down I can't run a real
bear I wish this would be nice after
that like to put on my feet as they'll
be all Waldo be tired but I mean just to
moisturize them too after all that
training and all that work this is
pretty nice oh that was everything in
