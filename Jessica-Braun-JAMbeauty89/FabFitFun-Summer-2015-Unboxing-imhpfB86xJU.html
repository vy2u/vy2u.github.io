going to be unboxing the fab fit fun box
for July
I never box this one this one is $50 a
month they sent this one to me for free
for PR purposes for me to do with what I
want I didn't have to unbox it on my
channel I just thought you guys would be
interested in it and I'm really excited
to see what's inside now
the claims for this box I'm on their
site it says $200 value for only $49.99
full-size premium products delivered
four times a year free shipping I I'm
pretty this isn't just a makeup one this
is supposed to be like life style so
looks so good I'm so excited so it says
five gonna find the summer edition 2015
so to soom then it's every season okay
the first thing I'm seeing is a spray
says Gorge I'll make you look amazing
daily spray a magical leave-in
conditioning spray that will turn your
hair into the sexiest hair ever
it says ever Wow so it repairs damaged
hair at shine detangles protects for me
that is pretty cool that it it detangles
and as the heat protected and all those
sort of things so that's actually pretty
cool so excited to give that a try I've
never heard of this it's 4 fluid ounces
yay no retail price for that one
retail value 2495 that's so cool
the next thing I'm seeing in here is
this says hello konjac I've never known
how to say that are cognac if you know
let me know down below these are these
like facial scrubs where you it's hard
it's made of the konjac fiber I wish I
knew how to say that but when you wet it
it kind of softens up like a sponge and
it's just really good for your skin and
exfoliating really gently so I've used a
few different brands of this I'm excited
to try this brand this one retails for
$12 and it says keep your skin soft and
glowing with the secret remedy from
Korea it exfoliates and thoroughly
cleanses pores
well definitely use that the next thing
in here who is make it say oh it's a
full-sized Tarte product this is the
tarte lipsurgence lip gloss and it is in
the shade
Truelove and it's like a red or anything
well it looks brighter than the red I'm
wearing today oh it's like a true gloss
so it's semi opaque it's not totally
opaque as that nice gloss to it but it
does have color so in this one these
have like kind of a sweet vanilla smell
so if you don't like that smell you
probably like it but cool I mean that's
a full-size those I would assume is
around 20 yeah retails for $19 the next
thing in here is this inkling scent 100%
pure fragrance an essential oil
alcohol-free let's see what this says
about it okay so it's a roll-on it says
we've got an inkling you're gonna love
this roll-on perfume perfect for travel
so the scent is sultry and it says it's
a blend of creamy sandalwood yes I love
sandalwood white amber lotus flower'
orchid Bulgarian rose and silky vanilla
started to try this sucker let us know
okay so oh my gosh it actually smells
good I feel like so often we all get
perfumes and subscription boxes and I'm
like I might wear it and then I end up
giving the way to my sister because I
don't end up liking it this one smells
like heaven I don't even oh my gosh
then Joel my little heart oh my gosh
that actually smells I mean I can't wait
for Tyler to smell this oh my gosh oh my
gosh okay
that is awesome so the retail that one's
$25 I would buy that one if they have
like a full-size I don't know
oh it says use code ffff 15 so like that
fit fun which will get you 15% off your
total purchase on inkling cents calm
cool all right the next thing I'm seeing
in here I'm really excited about it says
it's the everyday wireless speaker so I
wonder if it's like bluetooth does the
perfectly portable speaker features it's
on the go cliff can I put it in my
shower and on the go cliff it's great
for summer parties vacay s beach days
work out so much more so it's adorable
oh my gosh
a little fabfitfun logo on it that's
really cute love it it's pink my
favorite color all right so this retails
for $30 so it's not like a high tech
speaker but it is cute and this is
something like I could even have in here
no I don't Tyler took it so or just to
have like maybe even in your trunk
somewhere so that if you're like
randomly gonna go on a picnic you can
have a little speaker with you you know
what I mean
and it's got a little thing to charge it
up the next thing in here on scene is a
jump rope I don't even have a jump rope
anymore
it says fabfitfun cosmo body jump rope
did you know that you can burn around
150 calories in a 10-minute session of
jumping rope well we partnered with
Cosmo body the amazing new workout side
from Cosmo magazine bring you the
perfect jumper this one retails for $14
yes I give you that in here it's really
cute I can't see if jump rope in a long
time so that actually might be a fun
kind of different workout to do all
right the next thing in here they've got
some scratch nail wraps which I've
gotten these before I'm just not big my
nails are very long naturally so I'm not
big on the ropes because they never
quite look right on me but these are
actually really really cute ones so I
might give them a try because I love
this mint color and I love that some of
them have a design and some don't so
it's just like a little bit different
and funky and these retail for $12 it
also has says headspace it's like a card
three months free at headspace what is
that it says if you've been running
around in the world is spinning a little
too fast maybe you just need some space
headspace that is this app takes you
through a series of life-changing guided
meditations when you want wherever you
are it's a must stop for a list celebs
like Gwyneth Paltrow Emma Watson and now
you just a quick set shut your desk and
change your mindset and make your day so
the retail is 38 85 so I'm assuming
three months is that expensive I mean I
might try it I don't know I mean I'm
intrigued so I definitely want to check
it out and see like what is it just like
nice sounds or people talking to you
I've never really meditate I mean I pray
so I guess that's that's my own form of
meditating so I'm a little
entry so the last thing in there is this
Vaseline intensive care spray
moisturizer and I've seen videos about
these but I've never bought them so I'm
really intrigued to try it
it's the aloe soothe one and you just
spray it on let's just try it right now
feels like I'm springing on okay smells
like aloe vera so if you don't like that
smell it's not greasy I got the goose
bumps it is cold it's not like greasy or
anything and it almost feels like I'm
rubbing an oil into my skin not like but
not an oil it's like a watery oil it
doesn't feel like I'm rubbing a lotion
you know like this spray sunscreen that
is a very specific feel to it it feels
lighter than that so that's really nice
and it spreads easily which is really
nice so when I'm in a rush I will use
this cuz sometimes you're trying to
moisturize but you have the time to
moisturize so now will be nice and the
retail value for that is $7.99 so the
grand total they actually added niklas
oh there's another thing I just saw says
it's a necklace
retail $100 so it's the brand is Ren
wrin and it says it retails for $100 oh
my gosh it's called their moon pendant I
think okay so it's a golden hue and it
says it's a 14-karat gold I will I will
ruin this accidentally I'm not very good
with real jewelry and black sapphire
necklace okay so like I said it's just a
little gold one it has a little moon on
it where's the block cipher oh it's
right in the middle so in the middle of
the moon charm there's like a little
black sapphire oh my gosh it's cute I
will wear this okay it's this dainty
necklace are the perfect addition to
your summer outfit so it's 14 karat gold
dipped whether you luck out with the
horseshoe fall in love with the heart or
our starry eyed for the movement so I'm
assuming you could have gotten any of
those three you're gonna be obsessed
with these pendants each featuring a
black sapphire I will wear the heck out
of this I will wear this cuz I always
buy like fake jewelry because I ruined
I lose it i whatever so this is going to
be really nice to have one that maybe
won't tarnish so quickly I'm actually
really excited about this so they added
up the grand total for all of these are
two it's two seventy five seventy nine
and it would have cost fifty dollars so
I would say if it's in your budget or
maybe you're doing like a couple of
subscription boxes and it's all kind of
totaling to almost that much and you're
kind of like for me I'm not tired of
makeup calm down everyone I love makeup
but if you're kind of at that point
where you're like alright I've got a lot
of makeup I need to branch out maybe
into something different but you still
want to get that surprised this is
really nice so I can link fabfitfun I've
got a discount code down below as well

percent off of your order if you wanted
to give it a try I was really impressed
