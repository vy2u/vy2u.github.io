unboxing the fabfitfun center box
pricing and information and links are
below if you're curious about this let's
go ahead and dig it so fat v on comes
every season so this is the summer I
have already done the spring one I can
link it below but um they always have
like a little mini magazine that comes
with it to explain like just different
cute things about summer like summer
beauty routines talks about yoga things
like that just all kinds of things so I
love looking through that alright so Wow
look at this it is so beautiful this
lush to start somewhere I don't even
know where to start this first thing in
here is summer in rows by fabfitfun
microfiber yoga towel
I do not own one of these and I used to
do yoga a lot more than I do now now
I've really gotten into like kettlebells
and things like that and we obviously
run is why is that obvious to you in my
own life I'm like yeah I run all the
time um we also run a lot but I haven't
done a lot of yoga so it's actually
pretty cool to have a yoga towel like
this and it says well what does it say
there it says dream big that's cute
so that I will use and maybe it'll
prompt me to do some more yoga because I
always feel like I need to like switch
up my routine a little bit more so that
would be awesome next thing is this
fabfitfun everyday beach waves
conditioning texture plus light hold it
says you can apply this to wet or dry
hair provides hair with a light hold and
wavy texture while conditioning and
protecting with meadow foam seed oil so
that's always interesting I don't really
like to use I like texturizing spray
that are like an aerosol only because
that's a completely different finish on
your hair
whereas this I feel like it never works
quite right but I haven't tried it in a
while so I'm curious to try this one and
see if it's even better Wow so this next
thing is Trina Turk which her stuff can
be really expensive this is a tote it's
so cute what does this say okay it says
vitamin C but sta like the ocean that is
adorable so it's just a really big open
tote it's really like it feels really
well made in these row
so really soft I feel like a lot of
times that I've had like bags that have
ropes for handles they end up like
bothering my shoulder but these are like
insanely soft I don't really know how to
describe it but this is so fun and this
would be easy I bet you can machine wash
it if you know I like when I get back
from the beach or from a vacation like
that where I use a beach bag it's always
sandy and kind of gross and like it's
got like suntan lotion on it and I would
love to be able to wash it and this one
I feel like you could wash next thing
I'm seeing some lots of cards down here
this is a $35 off your first box from
hellofresh comm they almost always have
gift cards in here so it all almost
equals what you end up paying for the
box I know I've gotten quite a few and I
use them all like I've you I just use
them cuz does gift card so I'm
definitely gonna look into this it says
it's free shipping too which is nice so
then you don't have to feel like oh I'm
still paying for shipping so that is
awesome I will definitely use that next
thing in here is this stimulation daily
microderm scrub for face and body so
it's a citrus exfoliating cleanser
natural ingredients energizes dull and
damaged skin cool
so it says moisten your face with warm
water massage the cleanser into a lather
rinse thoroughly pat dry it's
interesting though those are directions
for the face but it says face and body
so I'd be curious to try it like if
you've got you know skin that you want
to you know if you're gonna be exposing
your arms in the summer and you want it
to look a like there's a little bit more
life to your skin this might be good for
that as well so this will definitely go
on my shower I will definitely use it
next thing is this veg sickles oh I get
it
champagne ice pop molds so it looks like
it's just like a these are cute and
actually I was reading the back as I was
opening the box and it said you know you
can fill it with like green
or you know like smoothie type thing and
freeze it so yeah it's just got this
shape and then it has this fix that
would go into it that fit perfectly into
the bottom so it stays in the center so
those I will use I think that's really
fun and that way you know if you did use
green tea or something like that you
could you know you feel healthy but it's
something like different than just
drinking iced tea you know what I mean
so I love that idea that's really cute
next thing in here is this OC atmosphere
protection cream it's a natural
lightweight daily moisturizer it's
antioxidant rich it creates a protective
barrier on your skin ideal base for
sunscreen and makeup so it sounds like
this isn't sunscreen it just protects
your skin but not against the Sun but
antioxidants really are so important and
so this is something that maybe I really
will use and I'm I just started using a
different moisturizer but once I'm done
with that this will probably be next
like in my lineup next thing is a lip
product it says passport to Beauty
gipset err luminous lips and bohemian
glow it's just like a beautiful metallic
color
that's pretty so I put some on my lips
it doesn't look too metallic which I
like it's just got the right amount of
Sheen I think so interesting it's really
really sticky so just be aware of that
the last oh there's a couple more things
another thing in here is bike um peed it
says medium what is it oh it's like to
prevent blisters on the back of your
heel that's pretty cool this would be
great to keep like in your purse or
somewhere where you know if you're
breaking in new shoes and you know it
you could toss this in comes with five
of them so that's actually that's really
cool it says it fits like a second skin
it keeps natural moisture in and germs
out so your skin can still breathe and
move that is really Wow it says it stays
in place for several days of course I'm
sure if you're showering it might not
stay but um the last thing in here is
this $3 off BB cream from Burt's Bees
and it has three shades but they came
with two of these oh maybe it's too
different
no these are both this is they have
light light medium and medium both of
the trials are in light medium but they
both have the $3.00 off coupons so
that's actually kind of cool I might try
it out has SPF of 15 and if I like it
then I can do it I have a feeling I
might be light instead of light medium
and then again you never know so that
was everything in the box again if
you're curious about this I'll link it
below I know that I have a percent off
coupon code they gave me I don't
remember if it's 10 or 15% off but I'll
have it below and other than that I hope
that you will check out some of my other
subscription box videos and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
