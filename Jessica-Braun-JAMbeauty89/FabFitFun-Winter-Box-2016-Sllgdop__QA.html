fabfitfun winter box
they said this to be quite a while ago
but I'm just now finally opening it I'm
so excited to see what's in here
links pricing information etc will be
down below let's get into it so this is
a pricier box and for me you know I
mostly focus on drugstore options of
things but it is kind of fun to get
these kinds of luxury things and I know
that some of you guys love these felt
that fun unboxing so it always comes
with kind of like a info guide a lot of
this is kind of Christmasy like I'm just
seeing some kind of Christmasy things
which I was out of town for everybody
knows thank you guys all know yours are
all like shut up Jessica we know stuff
I'm talking about like things necessary
and oh can I just use this it says this
is the sweet and spark curated vintage
jewelry and it says $40 on here so I'm
assuming that's like $40 to spend on
this site the website sweet and spark
calm so that's pretty cool I'm excited
to use that I'm gonna do that today just
get some tea and shop that's pretty
awesome they usually are really good
about that even though this is pricier
they'll give you some sort of like gift
card where you can use it and it almost
like equals how much you spent you know
the next thing this is hellofresh calm
and it is a it says three free meal so
it looks like it's like fresh stuff you
get to your door so I will again
definitely do that the next thing oh it
says if you put it says its ASPCA for
annum EMA moles so supposed to pick up
you and your adorable pet use hashtags
FFF animal love and hash tag about the
fun hashtag ASPCA and for every cute one
posted on Instagram they donate $1 to
the ASPCA so that's pretty cool boy I
should just add that tag to some I've
already taken two cute little Pinocchio
yes okay the next thing in here is a
nail polish and it's one of my favorite
brands
Zoya I am only trying well okay I should
only tried like to ZOA polishes but
they're amazing and they don't chip
easily like a Z chips on the OPI it's
hit or miss Zoey has been amazing it
reminds me of I have this because I just
hauled it the styling get the miracle
gel where they just are really good nail
polishes this is such a pretty color
it's in the shade Blair and it's just
this gorgeous like kind of deeper red
color reminds me of like ruby red
slippers I love that so the next thing
in here is this whare candlenut body
cream and it's a full-size which I love
and I love body creams this time of year
just because we're all so drying oh my
gosh so dry and like I don't know I just
feel like body butters are just so much
more moisturizing so I will definitely
use that the next thing in here is from
Shakti calm that is wrap so adorably let
us see another gift cards geez Louise
this one it's a lot of packaging for
that a $25 gift cards shop teks comm sin
set shop the world's best boutiques
awesome so I mean all again I'll
definitely use that and I will really
use this box well I don't know if I will
it says shop to you anyway it doesn't
matter
all right next thing oh that I was like
oh what's it happy it no that was what
was on the box Jessica all right this
one is a faff it fun wine stopper and
charm set so it's just this little
bright pink so it comes with six wine
charms I want to see them we love having
people over especially family and we
have like Christmas ones like that are
on a little Christmas tree you put on
the stems of the wine glasses but these
are a bunch of little guys that hold on
so you just remember what color you had
so that's adorable and then this is the
wine stopper so I'm assuming it goes
like this and he's upside down that's
hilarious
the next thing where do I begin whoo
these are some gloves Whitney Eve
fingerless gloves in this her collab
with that fit fun so they're just black
which I love they have this little brown
button and let's put them on fingerless
is nice because they keep most your hand
warm but you can still text or play
games whatever you're doing I wish you
to have these in
because you know there were a lot of
times I was looking up like bus routes
and stuff while we're waiting on a bus
stop my fingers are freezing and I had
like techy gloves but they don't work
flawlessly come on
so anyway very cute we'll definitely use
those the next thing is this sort of
this one reed diffuser sugar cookie home
fragrance I love reed diffuser I kind of
forgot about them so the idea is you dip
the reeds in it and then over time you
flip it and that scent just goes and I
think you can just kind of flip back and
forth however often you want to I
haven't found a reed diffuser that I
love that I feel like really actually
works so this one does this would be
something I might be willing to
especially it lasts a while to actually
go online and buy more so and I know
Tyler loves when the apartment smells
really good well who doesn't but he
really likes it so yeah the next thing
this brand is friends headphones and
they look like this a similar shape as
like the iPhone ones where they're kind
of weird but they go inside your ear but
they that's really cute like rose gold
detail on the outside so and I like that
they're black I really I like colorful
things but the classy gal in me really
likes black and white and gold like
really simple so I like that a lot and
Pinnochio might be gold recently be gold
a pair of headphones that I had they
were not cheap so now I'm like forget it
I need a new pair this is perfect and
the last thing in here is Dermalogica
like a set and they do skincare says
reveal a healthy glowing skin with this
three-step regimen designed to deliver
your best skin daily it's got a special
cleansing gel it's got a toner
interesting you spray it
I've never sprayed on a toner usually I
wipe it on so I like that idea because
then I'm wasting less cotton rounds and
then the last part is a skin smoothing
cream this is pretty cool i will i will
try this set out so that I know
Dermalogica is not cheap either so we
got this gloves full-size body butter
full-size oh and nail polish the wine
charms and stuff
for the $25 gift card the full-size rain
diffuser geez the headphones the three
free meal gift card and the $40 thing to
suite and sparks website that's a lot so
it's awesome this is another thing that
I've always thought would be an awesome
gift to get someone a month of the
fabfitfun box because it would be
expensive to do it all the time but if
you know someone that you don't really
know what to buy for and they've got a
lot of stuff this is awesome because
it's a lot of different things and it's
all unexpected so awesome gift idea as
well any time of year hopefully you

subscription box playlist where I unbox
other fat bit funds but also tons of
other subscription boxes I will link it
