gonna share with you guys my favorite
facial oils so these are products that
I've been using in the mornings before I
put on my makeup and I feel like for me
it's completely transformed the way my
skin looks not only do I feel like it
makes my skin look more radiant but I
feel like it's making it look more
moisturized just really healthy and I
felt like that was kind of something
missing like I'd put on a hydrating
primer and then a foundation but I would
still feel like I can see all my dry
skin like it just doesn't look the way I
want it to look and once I started using
these kind of before my primer and
foundation it it was basically the
answer to my prayer have yourself a cup
of tea I'm drinking some tea right now
and let's go ahead and chat about them
I'm drinking pregnancy tea it's alright
it's not my favorite kind of tea and
really all I want is just a nice cup of
coffee anyway okay so let's start with
the thing that kind of started it all
for me and like this is the honest to
goodness truth well that's not true
there are two products that started it
all for me so one of them was the
Smashbox photo finish primer oil
I had declutter this at some point I
bought it thinking maybe I'll use it it
might have even been on HauteLook for
like half off so I was like ah I'll just
give it a try I remember putting it on
my skin thinking it would be like all
the other primers i hack so it's primer
oil - primer whatever knowing that none
of the other primers I had were oils so
I put it all over and I'm like what the
heck and I'm like this is just a greasy
so I'm waiting and I'm like it's not
really do anything and so then I put on
my foundation I'm like this just doesn't
I don't know like I was like I think it
looks nice but it was just such an odd
experience putting it on as my primer
then I just the first time I used it I
kind of wrote it off I'm like I just
don't think I think it's okay but it's
just not my cup of tea so I think I
genuinely had it like in a de cluttered
box then I saw a tutorial of someone
using this and they were you know
putting it on and then they put on a
primer and a foundation I'm like oh so
you could put a primer like a regular
primer on top of this I'm like huh so I
gave it a try and I was like oh my skin
was so Hydra
so you can use this on its own for any
of these you don't have to put a primer
on top of it for me
often times I like to because I think it
kind of tones down the oil just a little
bit but it also that second layer the
second primer I'd put on would also help
to actually hold onto the foundation I
don't think any of these do a great job
of suddenly making your foundation stay
on longer even though some of them have
like primer in the title but what it did
do is it kind of prepared my skin
hydration wise and glow ah oh crap I
always get these oils so this is a clear
oil it's nice and thin like most of
these are and the reason I think they're
marketing it as a primer oil is because
it is pretty quick to sink in while your
skin does look a little bit greasy it's
not like a complete grease ball you know
what I'm saying
so I think if you were wanting to delve
into facial oils primer oils I would say
this might be a good one if it's in your
budget to start with if you have oily
skin I like this one still it's not my
favorite well get to my favorites but I
do like it well I continue to use it
absolutely what I recommend it yes I do
think it's the most matte oil of them
all does that make any sense I hope it
does so I'll info for this in a link of
course for all of these below so the
next one I try because they sent it to
me at PR was from far Sally and it's
their rose gold elixir and so I was like
huh I knew I heard about this brand
because of like Instagram and everyone
was using it it has these little gold
flakes in it which I've got other
primers and products that have like yeah
it says 24 karat gold infused Beauty oil
I don't know um but this you know do you
see the flakes on your skin no not
really I mean you might see like one or
two but it kind of just goes away it
doesn't it doesn't actually affect the
look of your skin but again a clear oil
completely clear it has it does have a
smell to it almost citrusy but like a
little off of citrus it's it's an odd
smell it's not a bad smell but if you
are sensitive to fragrance you will
notice this smell whereas with the
Smashbox one there's really not
really noticeable smell so again if
you're worried about fragrance Smashbox
is a good choice so this really does a
very similar thing although I do think
this one has a little bit more of a glow
factor to it and of course it's more
expensive these the far Sally ones are
ridiculously expensive so if you were
just dying to try this I also have and
I'm not really going to talk about this
one because I actually have not really
used it much but I figured I'd show it
to you if you were curious this is the
far Sally same brand unicorn essence and
it's in a purple tube and this one is
like a pink look it's kind of like whoa
you know but of course in the end is
your skin pink from it no it blends to
be translucent and a much sweeter smell
like a much sweeter smell what note what
difference do I notice between the two I
honestly think the rose gold elixir has
more of a shimmer to it not true glitter
but like it literally has a glow to it
whereas the unicorn essence is more just
like skin beautifying it does that make
any sense so don't let the pink color on
this throw you off your your skin's not
gonna look pink I don't really know why
they have that pink color in there other
than for like I feel like shock value
like when I first saw it on Instagram
people were doing I'm like why are you
putting red all over your face and I'm
like oh they wanted to but it's kind of
shocking to see I can't think of a
better term for that so out of these two
I've used the rose gold one a lot more
because it does have more that glow
factor but I do like the Unicorn essence
I just need to use it more before I can
like recommend it not recommend it but
it does say that this one is a skin
enhancing antioxidant serum where this
just says it's a beauty oil my hair
starts looking crazy it's cuz it's air
drying I was gonna straighten it and
then I looked in the mirror Mike my hair
looks alright like let's just continue
to give my hair a break okay so next in
the lineup was one that I fell in love
with pretty quickly after those two so
once I was starting it into Beauty
Beauty oils facial oils I was like okay
I want to try some other brands then I
tried this one this is the derma e
radiant glow face oil I've actually done
a video with derma e in the past about
this and some other products this video
is not sponsored they don't know I'm
talking
but I freaking love this face oil so you
can see there's literally shimmer in
this so again if you don't want that
radiant glow you don't want this one but
this has jojoba Argan oils sea buckthorn
oils just some good good products this
is actually a collaboration with Sun
kiss Alba here on YouTube but it says
home oil and replenishing argan oil
moisturize help combat dehydration and
wrinkles but they promote radiance sea
buckthorn oil helps to smooth and add
shine and then there's mica in it that
adds a natural-looking brilliance so
this I will I will use this both as just
on its own with no primer and sometimes
with another primer do again do I think
it really holds onto foundation no I
don't think any of these really hold
onto foundation but this one has kind of
a yellow hue to it at first kind of a
golden hue there's definitely little
shimmers in it you need a very little
bit this is one of those oils that a
little bit really does go a long way
like I can go all the way up my arm at
this there's not really a noticeable
smell to this but again it this one
feels so luxurious more luxurious than
the other 3 I've mentioned yet just a
very I mean it almost feels like I have
a moisturizer on my hands right now
which I guess technically I do it's just
in the form of this oil it ends up
looking I mean you can see it I've got
it on my arm now it's it's not oily
really none of these are super oily but
this one really isn't it just imparts
this gorgeous glow and with this one
having better ingredients in it this is
one that I tend to reach for a lot a lot
a lot lot especially in these winter
months when our skin just tends to look
more sallow and kind of dry and just
kind of dull that's how I feel anyway
about my skin so this is one that I
absolutely adore adore adore and it's so
much more affordable and the other ones
I've mentioned so far oh the next one
and actually this is one that I use
today this is the Physicians Formula
Organic wear bright booster oil elixir
this also has some wonderful ingredients
it is a clear liquid you kind of push
the top really cute bottle and when I
used it today what I did
is on bear already cleansed skin I just
put a drop here here here that's pretty
much it maybe sometimes a small drop on
my nose and that's all it takes really
with most of these and you just kind of
rub it I kind of rub it a bit and then
I'll just kind of press it into the skin
and you just feel like your skin is like
thank you for this and I feel the same
way about the derma e one both of these
because again there's good ingredients
in them and I don't while I do feel like
like I've said it really does make your
skin look a little oily at first if you
wait a minute it really does tone down
if you want to tone it down more put on
maybe a mattifying primer although I
feel like that kind of would go against
it but at the same time see I don't
really like matte matte skin so that's
not really the game I'm in I feel like
you could do it and it would kind of it
would definitely tone it down but at
least you're still getting the skin care
venom I'm just thinking out loud right
now you're still getting the skin care
benefits but you're getting the matte
look you want so I guess there'd be no
harm in trying that again this is more
affordable it's available at the
drugstore I've seen it anywhere
Physicians Formula sold I'm I usually
see this I actually bought it online on
their website just because I was buying
a bunch of their stuff but I just I've
grown to really really like that one I
feel like it's really quick and easy to
use it sinks in pretty quickly and then
I can go right in I did not use a primer
with this today I just put this on no
other primer and then I went in with
like a I mix the Missha BB cream with
the it cosmetics CC cream I love both of
them
BB and CC what am I talking about anyway
so I mixed those and I really I feel
like my skin looks pretty healthy I'm
I've got a lot of wet and wild products
on my face right now cuz I'm also gonna
be filming a video about that and
there's some products that I feel like
I'm looking at I'm like I don't really
like the way that look but the skin
portion that underneath I loved so keep
that in mind
another Physicians Formula one I've
tried is this they're calling this as
serum but I feel like because of the way
it looks it really is more of like a
makeup e oil serum versus a skincare
serum if that makes any sense so it's
the Physicians Formula rose a all day
oil-free serum says it brightens and
tightens its Pearl luminous formula
radiant glow and
with rose water to help soothe calm and
hydrate skin it's got goji and Kakadu
plum which is antioxidant rich and got
vitamin C this dropper is terrible I can
never get any product up into the
dropper none look at that come on
Physicians Formula I literally can't I
have to like wipe it off whatever that
frustrates me every single time but this
definitely is a pearl luminescent glow
is that a word so this is one that
sometimes I'll take and the only reason
I'm mentioning it in this video because
it really doesn't fit in but this is
another one that it's got decent
ingredients it has a little bit of a
rosy smell but nothing too too strong
and I feel like this looks so pretty on
top of these oils I'll use this on top
of it and it kind of it'll tone down the
oil portion but it still amps up the
glow factor especially if you're putting
on like a really high coverage
foundation I've noticed all of these
especially this helps to kind of make it
look like your skin is not just dead
like there's some real life behind that
perfected skin does that make sense so I
do like this I wish the dropper were
better I think the packaging is really
pretty though the last one one mentioned
is a crazy expensive one this is from
drunk elephant they sent me these a long
long time ago I've been trying this but
this one I use at night I don't use this
one in the morning so it's got
antioxidants Omega 6 and 9 it will
hydrate preserve and heal your skin
restore its useful youthful glow it's a
straight from the PIP of the marula
fruit it's untouched by any chemical or
fragrance natural or synthetic remains
in its purest form it's completely
unrefined marilla oil
simple right all of these other ones are
mixes of a bunch of different things
this is just simple oil I've been
watching so many different skincare
youtubers here lately I've just become
kind of obsessed and I'm learning as
much as I can and what I've learned is
that this really is it's expensive but
for a reason and a lot of their products
but especially this because it is a
hundred percent you know you can get
marula oil but that's not unrefined and
it's just not going to have the same
exact benefits because it's gonna lose
some of its power in doing those kinds
of processes so very very thin very
luxurious kind of an oil I used this
I'll put on you know I'll cleanse my
skin
I'll double cleanse my skin I will put
on a toner in essence I'll put on some
of my treatments and serums then I'll
put the oil on this oil before my
moisturizer and what I've kind of
realized for a while I was putting a lot
on and I'm like this is crazy like it's
it's so oily I can barely put my
moisturizer on top of it then I realize
you really need a smaller amount I just
had to tone it down which is great
because then you're saving some of your
product cuz it is so expensive and so
the amount I use I feel like it's gonna
take me forever to go through this this
is one fluid ounce but I just feel like
when I wake up in the morning after
having this on under my moisturizer my
skin just looks healthy and I feel like
for the longest time I wasn't seeing
that in my skin and I'm like man like
last night I did this mask and I did
this and that and I would never see the
results I wanted in the morning and this
is one that I really did and it really
impressed me
alright there's I'm sure you could use
this in the morning
like if you wanted to just buy this it's
just that I've gotten so used to using
at night that's just all I and I don't
want to take it back and forth I get
ready and here in the morning I get
unready at night in my bathroom so I
don't know that's just my own thing but
I really really like this a lot I think
it is worth the money I just hate that
it's so expensive but I get it but you
guys know what I'm saying so I know this
video I feel like my brain was all over
the place I'm gonna be honest I started
this video like four times
I couldn't get my brain in the right
space to like talk about these because
they're the idea of facial oils is so
new to me I could talk about foundations
all day I shut up outs all day because
I'm so used to I shut up house but with
this I'm like you know what is it that
you're looking for what do I know about
the ingredients and you know and it's
it's still uncharted territory so bear
with me as I'm learning more about these
as well if you have any recommendations
of things you'd like me to try and
review on my channel I'd love to try
more of these and maybe do another video
of like another five or six of them um
especially if you've noticed any at the
drugstore
I think the cheapest one I mentioned was
this derma e one and the most expensive
might be a tie between I need to look it
up but a tie between the drunk elephant
and the Far Sally they're both really
expensive actually the Physicians
Formula One's might be around the same
price
is the Dermody and then Smashbox right
in between okay so I hope that this was
helpful if you enjoyed it definitely
give it a thumbs up I hope you'll
subscribe as well and I'll see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
