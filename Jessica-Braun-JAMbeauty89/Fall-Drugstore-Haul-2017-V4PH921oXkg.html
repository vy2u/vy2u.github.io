target and I literally want everything
let's see what I actually buy I'm gonna
try to hold some restraint but I figure
it's fun to take you guys along cuz I
love shopping and I know some of you
guys love shopping so let's see what I
buy okay I have to try this each one for
covering dark circles I've never seen
this but it looks like it's like a
liquid concealer kind of a thing and I'm
so intrigued by that one so I loved this
for a very long time but I wish that
this solid cleansing oil came alone
because I always get like water in the
cleansing cream when I try to use both
look at this I'm wondering if this is
the thing it's the nourishing cleansing
ball and so I'm gonna buy it
hoping it's like this same ingredients
cuz it was a really good cleansing ball
but I didn't like that was pair with the
other thing so I'm gonna buy it and see
what like I don't I've never even heard
of this so I'm really excited it's a pad
away concealing base let's see what it
says it says concentrated yet skin like
elastic and long wearing what does this
say it like does okay pad on to dark
circles redness or uneven skin tone and
blend mixing the moisturizer for sheer
or pad on for full so ah hey I'm
intrigued I feel like it's kind of like
supposed to be like that tart shaped
tape this is the best mascara I've ever
tried I'm buying another one this is the
third when I bought I don't care
I'm not going to buy them today but
these are really good I've had like a
smaller pack and they removed like
makeup swatches really good so I would
have to assume they work really well in
the eyes breathe the name of that one
great the name of that one
look at how there's a complete teller
difference what what and when I bought
Rose a champagne it was like a pinkish
so this makes no sense I have one more
of this NYX dark circle concealer and I
want to see if it's anything like my
Bobbi Brown one that's kind of like that
salmon concealer because it covers dark
circles so well so let's see also though
it's like if you want higher coverage is
of the balm but I have like every shade
at this point I'm in the soap &amp;amp; Glory
section of Target I am so curious it's
like a highlighter but it's like a
liquid one and really honestly it's
almost full I just love the name it
makes me think of hocus-pocus I'm trying
to be really strong and say no to Sonia
Kashuk because their stuff always looks
so awesome but I feel like everything
I've tried it's like half of its gonna
happen
my real question is should I try this
primer I think I wanna try we're so
curious how should I try the concealer
ooh
I figured fair would be probably good
for me I think I'm gonna try this too
but I'm gonna get the colors are all
wrong because there's I can't find any
150 buff but I'm just gonna get 130
porcelain and hope for the best
I'm just intrigued by this like it it
seems like it'd be a good everyday
foundation you know look who I found
look at this handsome fella you're so
mean
silly you're not silly you're so cute
so I also picked up this Herbal Essence
Arabica coffee fruit it smells like I
believe it's pronounced really I don't
really know
I think it's right I don't need nail
polish so I think we're gonna call it
it's a short video but we need to go get
maybe clothes also they only sell
low-fat cottage cheese here so I didn't
get I need the high fat yeah we're
trying to get 4% fat so much I'm so
picky and so are you poor Percy so
what's we're trying to get 4% fat large
curd that's all there is that's all I
could do small current as long as it's
low percent or I mean 4% 4% high percent
yeah there was like there was non-fat
and there was low-fat I'm like where's
the fat I want to get the fat one they
didn't have it so we don't mind it
cottage cheese wouldn't so in the end
this is everything that I bought I'm
really excited to try the shampoo and
conditioner and as I mentioned that
mascara I already love so I'm excited to
have a backup and I think I realized as
i swatched this at home that this is too
light for me but they really didn't have
the shade in between that I needed like
150 buff so I'm gonna have to look for a
shade I like so I might return this but
other than that I have I did end up
trying this this is the next day that
I'm filming it by the way I did end up
trying this and it reminds me a lot of
Tarte shaped tape so I'm gonna have to
try it out some more so I will plan to
do a haul update here in three to four
weeks so that I can really try these out
and be able to give you my actual
thoughts on them so this video is more
just for fun to haul but a haul update
will come soon on my channel so
definitely stay tuned and subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next one
