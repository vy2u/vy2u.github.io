a fashion haul it's kind of a fall
fashion haul and you'll see what I mean
it's kind of like back-to-school except
for more like back to work you'll see
what I mean okay so the reason that I
went freaking shopping was because I
needed to buy a dress for a wedding i'm
going to in a couple weeks in Florida
and it's like it's either on the beach
or on a boat I don't really know or both
I don't know maybe they'll be on the
boat and will be on the beach I don't
know no so I was trying to find a dress
and I'm like okay I've never been to a
beach like no I've never been to a
wedding on a beach so I'm like okay I
think I want like a coral type dress but
maybe like teal and I want it may be
like breezy but I don't want it to be
too revealing you know there were so
many kind of like stipulations in my
head of what I wanted and here's the
problem it's fall so all the summer
tight dresses are well okay it's kind of
a problem but that's not really a
problem I'm gonna get a good deal
because everything's on sale and
clearance that summer related however
that means everything's been picked
through and size-wise there's like no
options I I would find a dress that I
loved but they wouldn't have it in my
size and then I think oh I can maybe
like take it in and I'm like no that's
way too hundred work for what that I'm
just I just want to buy a freaking dress
that I like and just be done so this
turning into a nightmare i was at the
mall for like six hours and found
nothing like I tried on probably like 40
dresses and I was wearing an outfit that
was not easy to take on and off I don't
know what I was thinking you guys know
what I mean I was like come on i'm tired
of trying on dresses walked away
empty-handed except for I also had bags
of these clothes because I also at the
same time I was looking at like dress
clothes because the student teaching I'm
like okay actually need to have like
some professional looking clothes so and
I have some but I definitely needed more
because five days a week of dress
clothes is that's a lot so I just needed
some more options so I did walk away
with a few things so one of the things
that I got these this was from H&amp;amp;M these
are their dress
pants sort of their this really pretty
like darker kind of khaki but they're
stretchy and they are there long pants
and they're like you know skinny if you
will all the way down and they have the
feeling of their stretchy like i said
but they don't have any buttons or
anything they're just like stretchy so
if you don't like that kind you wouldn't
like this these were 1795 at H&amp;amp;M and I'm
in love with this color and they fit
exactly how I wanted them to fit and I
kind of like that it's stretchy so
there's no weird bulkiness so if I wear
a fitted dress shirt it won't look all
weird and bulky if you know what I mean
because it does come up a little bit
higher but I love them I love the color
1795 is not bad and it's kind of nice to
kind of wear them as like a legging type
pant but they're not leggings and like
the back I mean they're like real
pockets there it's like totally normal
pants except for that top in fact that
they're stretchy I love them but they
are thicker material so they don't look
like leggings you know what I'm saying I
love these so that was one that I was
really excited about and I also got
another pair of pants from TJ Maxx it's
the brand y mi and um like literally why
am i and these were on sale for 999 and
they're like this really pretty cream
color again they're just uh thin skinny
pants and the I liked the pockets in the
back how they're kind of like almost
triangles with the little gold thing so
I really like that they fit me really
well and they were ten dollars like me
up and the beauty of both of these the
reason i was going for like the skinny
fit and they're not like completely
form-fitted skinny but they're just kind
of like more like straight skinny I hope
that makes any sense I don't know but
because I like to tuck these into boots
and I love love love love love boots and
that's like all i wear fall and winter
and even in the spring so you know
having pants that i can tuck into them
is really kind of important to me right
now i know it sounds silly but some of
you will know what I mean so I was
really excited about both of those
because they're gonna look really cute
with my brown foods of my black boots
okay so another thing that I was really
excited to find was this taupe colored
blazer it was from H&amp;amp;M and it was on
sale for twenty dollars originally 49
95 but it's one of those that's so
fitted like so perfectly fitted and and
that like sleeves are fitted it's so
perfect it's exactly what I was looking
for and for twenty dollars this is a
really well-made blazer I know that hmm
sometimes gets a bad rap because some of
their clothes maybe aren't as well made
and I would agree with that but some of
them really are and of course the price
point goes up with the quality but on
sale for this and the color is so
perfect and it's going to go with like
everything and the thing is I already
own this exact same blazer in like hot
pink and I'm in love with it and the
problem was I bought it a year ago and i
bought it for like forty nine ninety
five it might have been on sale but not
like twenty dollars on sale so i was
very excited when I found this because I
knew how much i love the pink one and i
loved the fit so this was a really great
fine and I'm gonna be able to pair it
with so many different outfits so
another thing I went to is this year's
that has the Kardashian Kollection I was
that Sears looking for dresses and then
I got lost in the summer clearance I let
all the Kardashian Kollection clothes
were on clearance so this was 999 and
guys look at this color this is okay
this is exactly my favorite color this
like lavender II pink or like lilac I
don't know because I love pink in
general but this this right here this
color and I've never seen assured this
color and it's just a really nice simple
dress shirt it fits really well I
probably would have bought this for the
color alone but it actually fits really
well and I like it's got this cute
button detail in the back it's just
really simple and I like it it's just a
standalone shirt I don't need to worry
about layering it with a blazer or
anything like that it's just a
standalone dress shirt and the collar is
celebrating new services like $49 like
no way jose i've never paid off her
shirt but for 999 it feels it feels
pretty well made and i love it so that
was a good fine and then this was crazy
cheap this was also at sears i think
it's the joe boxer brand and it was only
299 it's just as real
cute tank top um the only thing is it's
cotton on the back I hate tank tops that
are like that I don't know why I don't
like the sequin in the front cotton in
the back two reasons why I bought this
it was 299 okay three reasons it was 299
it's sparkly and I really like the
colors in this and the stripes and also
how cute would this be with that taupe
blazer right or my pink blazer that
might be a lot of pink that's a little
like Elle Woods there i don't know but i
figure even though it's cotton in the
back I'm dropping it even though it's
cotton in the back it would look really
cute with a sweater a cardigan a blazer
so if I layer something with it I would
like it alone I just wouldn't wear it I
don't know why is that weird that I'm
like so picky about that but hey
whatever my money and my style but 299
come on three dollars yes please he has
for my you so another thing I got and
this was 498 at burlington coat factory
no TJ man berlin i don't know i think it
was burlington coat factory which is
just one of my favorite stores i also
who I should probably show those I
posted on Instagram a pair of sunglasses
I just got from Burlington and they were
like 999 there Oscar de la Renta and
they're so cute so you can just go to my
Instagram because you know what I think
they're in my car but I love them and
they always have really cute designer
sunglasses for really really cheap I'm
for like ten dollars pretty much across
the board so this was 498 it's a long
like maxi skirt but here's the kicker
it's it almost looks like like Jasmine
pants it's got these four panels that
are sheer so there's like a liner of the
skirt that goes to you know a little
above the knee and then the rest of
these sheer panels and there's four of
them so I figure when we are in Key West
and in South Beach we're going to be in
a few locations in Florida it's just
going to be nice and breezy and cute um
I just love it of course this is not
something I would wear to work which
mostly I was buying things for work but
this I mean I figure four five dollars
if I wear this at least like three times
I've got my money's worth and i'm sure i
will wear it more than that so i'm
excited i kind of wish now that we're
summer so I could wear it more but I'm
we're in Florida so and then another
thing i got was this shirt was only 398
at burlington and they also had a baby
blue and I'm kind of thinking I should
have gotten baby blue oh well but it
fits really really well it's really
simple but then it's got this lace
detail on the side that is completely
see-through and that is why I would not
wear it to work because it's see through
all the way down but I love the little
cute detail on the back with the button
and it's just really simple and for four
dollars Mike I where the heck out of
this and the summer come on now I guess
I could layer that with a blazer though
to cut and I I mean and then it would
kind of hide the lace on the side cuz
you know come on not trying to look
riskier but in front of a bunch of
elementary school students so um anyway
that is my entire hall and I hope that
was fun to watch I don't I guess doesn't
think about halls long what do people
gain from watching them but i watch
calls all the time too but I guess at
the end of the day just getting ideas
maybe your inspiration or even just if
there really are good deals going on
like guys here okay if you can take away
one thing from this take away the fact
that right now everything summers on
clearance but you should know that
already really and so I mean you're you
can go to the department stores
especially and find three dollars shirts
and three dollars skirts and I mean it's
just the time to stock up ladies anyway
I will see you guys very very soon I
hope this is adorable bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
