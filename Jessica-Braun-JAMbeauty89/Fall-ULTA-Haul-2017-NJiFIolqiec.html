an Ulta haul this haul is sponsored by
Ulta and I still feel like that's crazy
to even be able to say because the fact
that all - even knows who I am is like
amazing I shopped at Ulta way before I
started watching YouTube videos know
before I started filming them when I
started watching YouTube videos I want
all these products I've had them like
you know on a list like I want to try
all these things and so I'd save up and
I would go to Ulta because they have the
high-end and the drugstore portion so it
was kind of the best of both worlds and
they always have amazing sales and so
they are having a sale this week the
week of September 24 through the 30th
they're having 50% off a bunch of stuff
they're having 30% off of NYX and I got
a lot of Nick stuff they're having all
kinds of body care hair care tons of
sales so it's kind of one of those times
to stock up especially right before fall
hits the best time of year so and I end
up always shopping more in the fall I
don't know what it is it's like I could
just get so excited and there's you know
all kinds of good products out there and
a lot of new I'm like holding these and
pretty a lot of new products that are
out there new to me and also just new
generally so I'm excited to show you
what I picked out from the sale if
you're interested in shopping this sale
definitely check out my link below it's
right down there and otherwise let's go
ahead and get into it let's start with
the makeup like just love it firstly I
got this NYX
beauty sponge it's their flawless finish
blending sponge and it's black I'm dying
to try this cuz I heard a lot of people
say that there that this sponge was like
freaking unbelievable let me go get it
wet and let's see how it does good news
so it feels really soft and squishy that
for me is usually a good sign not always
because sometimes like there's one like
the Ecotools one I'm not a really big
fan of that one but this one it does get
pretty soft and squishy so anyway so I'm
excited to try it it does have like this
chiseled part which is a little bit
different than like a classic Beauty
Blender and of course all these
different sponges have different things
about them but I'm excited and I also
like that it's black
I had a black Beauty Blender and
Pinocchio my dog got ahold of it and
like chewed a chunk out of it so I'm
like man I like that it's black just cuz
I feel like it's like chic I don't know
so I'll have to let you guys know
I would love to do like a halt update
kind of a video on this after I've tried
all of these for a while but yeah let
you know okay the next product I got is
also from NYX and it's there this is
everything bomb and it's good in this
really cute packaging it's kind of domed
on the top it I don't notice the smell
which I like because sometimes you know
lip balms can have this smell and it
kind of makes you like nauseated it's
totally clear even though it looks red
like it might have a pink tint to it but
it just says it's a lip loving balm and
I'd never heard of it so I wanted to try
it to let you know I'm always on the
hunt for like the best lip balms
especially cheap ones because I feel
like we go through lip balms so quickly
so I don't want to spend like $40.00 it
kind of formula wise reminds me of the
really expensive Dior one the creme de
rose but this feels a little bit more
moisturizing of course I'm trying it on
my hand but yeah so I'm excited to try
this the reason by the way I got a lot
of NIC stuff is cuz it's 30% off during
the sale and there were a lot of things
on my list that were available online so
I was really excited so this is the NYX
glitter primer and I've been wanting to
get my hands on this for so long it is
always sold out like everywhere I looked
but Ulta and it's just it's meant to be
a really really really good primer it's
kind of a light light beige but it's
definitely a thicker eye primer but it's
meant to really hold on to glitter or
shadows that have a lot of glitter and
I've been wanting to own this for so
long I've heard people really really
liked it so I think the packaging is
really pretty but I'm glad this is like
a something that I feel like I have to
have in my collection at least some kind
of glitter primer and since NYX is
inexpensive it was on sale and I've
heard it's really good I had to have it
alright so another thing this is from
Maybelline it's their master blush color
and highlight kit and I was intrigued
because I liked that it didn't have a
bronzer is that weird like I thought it
was cool that it was like blushes and
then of course like this little kind of
highlight shade and I wanted to see it
seems pretty pigmented the shades are
really pretty
oh oh that's not bad
try the deeper and brighter shades too
yeah so that is nice and pigment
the highlight definitely feels more
powdery than than the other ones but
once you really get it going like now
that I'm beyond the first layer its
super pigmented and I thought these
shades were so pretty as we head into
fall kind of the berry tones and they
were actually big pants so you can
actually get your brush in there and
you're not accidentally dipping into the
other ones so I thought that was really
really neat and I really haven't tried a
lot of these so I'm just decided to try
it next thing I am so excited about this
this is the NYX perfect filter palette
now I already have one but it's in the
shade I already have it in all of you
this one is in golden hour and oh my
gosh look at these shades they're like
the most classic neutral everyday shades
Browns and gold's and they've got a mix
of matte and shimmer and for me I'm like
this is exactly what I wear like every
day so I was like I have to have it I
have to have it so here are some of the
swatches they're really really pretty
there are three matte and then seven
shimmer but they're so pretty I love
that these are larger pans there's no
extra packaging it's thin and sleek and
I was so excited I didn't remember
seeing this before so I don't know if
it's a new one of them or what but I
love the shades in it and I was so
impressed with the first perfect filter
palette that I had bought in all of you
let me show it to you
this one had a really cool range of
shadows and I just love this so much so
I was excited to see one that's even
more up my alley so very excited to try
that they have the same like packaging
on the front and I love them now I'm
like starting a collection of these okay
so I also got this NYX cake that powder
eyeliner and the reason I bought this
was because I have really gotten into
lately of course I didn't today but I've
really gotten into doing more powder
liner and just kind of smudging it
instead of always doing like gel liner
or liquid liner
it makes my makeup application quicker
when I'm getting ready for work in the
morning and I loved it it had black and
brown so I presume oh that is so hopeful
haha this is crazy
woah I'd have to be really careful
because that is like ink
pigmented yeah like hard to get off
status so good to know but it's gonna be
perfect for liners so I'm really excited
to own that and I feel like that's one
of those things that I could travel with
a lot as well okay so the next thing I
got
I promise these aren't all from NYX the
next things aren't but this was their
brush cleaner and I knew I was running
out of the brush cleaner I've been using
and it looks a lot like this so you know
this is pretty inexpensive you know I
usually put it in a like little tin so I
can dip the brush in it things like that
so I was excited to have this and of
course it's inexpensive it has 9.13
fluid ounces so yeah I'll have to let
you know how this works
okay next thing I got was from ulties
Ulta beauty brand and this I bought some
one of these three-in-one smoothies last
Christmas for like a holiday haul at
Ulta and so I went in and I was you know
looking at all their holiday things and
I thought probably way more than I
needed to buy as usual and I saw they
had a whole bunch of these and they had
some like Christmasy like scents and I
remember buying one I don't remember the
scent but it was the best bubble bath
I've ever had like the bubbles are so
soft the smell just fills the air so
this one it's their three-in-one
smoothie so it's a shower gel a bubble
bath and shampoo I just use it for a
bubble bath but I like that had a pump
so I can really quickly pump it into the
bath but it's buttercream cupcake yes it
smells exactly like buttercream frosting
oh my gosh so I can't wait to get a bath
probably tonight I just love it I love
the smell I love that it's a huge
container I love that it's got a pump
and they had a bunch of different smells
I almost got more than one but I was a
very good girl and I only got one but I
love it okay next up is I was just
curious about this it's the brand
organics and I tried a lot of their
shampoos and conditioners but this was
their radiant brunette line so bamboo
brunette is what it's called so it
supposed to be hydrating its color
reviving I've actually never color
styled my hair color styled what colored
my hair but it has bamboo extract and
almond oil and I used to use like that
John Frieda brunette stuff and I really
do feel like it kind of made my hair a
little bit shinier and made the brunette
like the different shades of brunette in
my hair
stick out or stand out so I'm excited to
try this it just has a nice clean scent
yeah so I'm just excited all again I'll
let you know if they work next thing I
got there's some youtuber that talks
about hemp's a lot and that they love a
lot of their products so I got a couple
things I was out of body scrub and I
always have one in the shower and I do
it maybe every other day I self-tan
today and so I always always use a body
scrub before that but even when I'm not
self-tanning because I don't do it that
often even when I'm not I like to
exfoliate a couple times a week just
because it's good for your skin so this
is their sugar body scrub it's just
their original and I'm curious does it
have a smell oh it has like this very
like almost like citrusy kind of a smell
let me see that it feels like oh yeah so
it's like a gel but it has those
exfoliating little sugar granules in
there so this is exactly what I was
looking for but I like that it's more of
a gel because sometimes when it's just a
scrub like just the granules it gets all
over because I like kind of scoop it out
and then it kind of falls but when it's
in a gel it's easier to use and
manipulate so I'm really excited to have
that and I this one is gonna be a little
different this is their triple moisture
herbal whipped cream body scrub
so I was like what so this should be a
little bit different than that one let's
see oh my god oh oh my gosh I love the
smell of this it first of all it looks
like mint chocolate chain what mint
chocolate chip like but it creamier it
looks like kind of a pistachio mint
color what is the smell it reminds me of
something I used when I was younger so
it has the granules in it but it's kind
of a similar texture to that but maybe a
little bit more almost looks lotion II
in a way so I'm excited to use that one
and then I also from hemp's got their
triple moisture herbal whipped cream
body wash just cuz it's like well if I'm
trying all those things I want to try
something else too so again I'll have to
report back maybe in a haul update about
these okay next thing I got from the
body shop it's just it's a little travel
size but it's their body butter in
almond milk and honey I
love almond milk and honey it smells so
good mmm and their body butters are
famous like the body shop for Timmy is
known for their body butters and I love
getting the travel size because I do
travel with these and so I can get
really really really intense moisture
even when I'm traveling which is huge
because my skin just gets dried out no
matter where we travel so I love their
body butters and I really like the
almond milk and honey it definitely has
like a honey like a true honey scent to
it so if you don't like that you
wouldn't like this scent but they have
all different kinds and then I also got
from organics these two different hair
products this is their body Renu dry
shampoo and it's a fiber ful is what
it's called
and I'm always down for trying new dry
shampoos this one is also a dry shampoo
it's there
silky blowout blow dry extender eye
shampoo so I presume you are supposed to
put yeah use after a blowout or on dry
hair shake well spray lightly throughout
dry hair especially in the roots
massaging to scalp
brush out and reapply see I was thinking
maybe you'd blow-dry it as well just to
refresh it because I've done that too
with dry shampoo I'll put it in and then
I'll also blow-dry my hair again even
though it's already dry just to really
get it into there anyway so I'm excited
to try both of these I love dry shampoo
I use it all the time even with my like
curly hair I can all still kind of flip
it under and lift up and get in the
roots let it sink in for five to ten
minutes and then just do this and for
the most part you don't see the white
cast things like that I try not to spray
too much and just concentrate it in the
areas I need and I make sure it's under
my hair so when it lays back down it's
not like right there anyway
so definitely excited I'll definitely
let you guys know and I think the
packaging of these is really really
sleek and like mattified I think that's
cool another product I got are these
Ardell like a kit of lashes these are
their natural ones in 110 I have good
luck with our Dell there are some like
really expensive lashes that I feel like
the band is too thick and it just looks
ridiculous and they're hard to apply but
our Dell is great because their band is
really easy to glue on they're easy to
bend and manipulate and I feel like once
it sets they stay on and they don't
budge so and I love that they're more
inexpensive and you can get a bunch of
them I haven't tried these one tends
these are new to me so I'm excited to
try and they look a little bit more
natural but still of course you know
it's gonna be a little more glamorous
than not wearing them at all so I was
excited to try them so definitely check
my link below if you are interested in
any of these products and if you're
interested in shopping this sale the
sale is going on September 24th through
the 30th if you are interested
