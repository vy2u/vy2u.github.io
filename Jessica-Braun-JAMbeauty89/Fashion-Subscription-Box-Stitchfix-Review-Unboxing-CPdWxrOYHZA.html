to share with you a quick unboxing of my
stitch fix box so I recently got stitch
fix if you haven't seen my past videos I
will link them below where I go into a
lot of detail but it's a clothing
fashion subscription box that I've
absolutely fallen in love with and it's
a nice break for me from all of my
makeup subscription boxes that I receive
each month and it's one of those things
that it's one of those gifts to myself
every time I order one you don't have to
do it monthly you can kind of tell them
when you want it you schedule so you
could do it like once a year or you know
whatever you schedule when you want it
which I really like because there'll be
times like over the holidays I didn't
want to get me because I was you know
focusing on gift-giving so I just didn't
schedule a fix that month fix anyway but
you get five different products you I've
recently linked my Pinterest board where
they can see what you like on Pinterest
what you pinned so my stylist on there
has been basing what she's been sending
me on my Pinterest board and I think
that's awesome because then I can go
through and like pin tons of new stuff
that I'm really liking so she's got a
better idea of what to send me you can
also make requests but this time again I
just wanted her to send me five cool new
pieces so I'm excited to show them to
you looking to do so I'll put my link
below for this it is a referral link if
you don't feel comfortable using that
I'll put the regular link as well no
pressure but I always like to make that
very clear to you guys she wrote a
little blurb about what she sent and why
she sent it based on my board so I'm
going to kind of pull in what she said
so the first thing I mentioned was I
wanted a pair of darker wash skinny
jeans because I wear those like every
Friday I'm a teacher every Friday at
work we can wear jeans and so I wanted a
pair that was like kind of nicer and I
said you know no distressing just a nice
dark wash pair of jeans so she sent
these level 99 brand jeans and they're
just absolutely standard I love that the
back it's just nothing special very
simple and it certainly fitted all the
way down to the bottom I like that
there's a little bit of fading but not
much they're just a comfortable fit you
guys they've got a little bit of
elasticity so they're not I mean they're
certainly form-fitted but they fit me
really well and what's nice is if you
receive some of the products and you
feel like they're not quite fitting you
the way you
- you decide not to keep some of them
and you send them back in the little bag
they give you to send it back you fill
out like a survey online and you say
okay the reason I'm sending this back is
like the fit was too tight it was too
big so then they get even better at kind
of deciding what's going to fit you
what's not so every month it gets better
so love these these I'm definitely
definitely keeping and I'll put the
prices of these political so if she said
for a look that will work for teaching
or a weekend brunch try those jeans with
the Pixley sweater which I'm going to
show you which is complete with cutout
detailing which is a must-have trend for
this season so this is just a very
simple black sweater I've already worn
it like toys but what I like about it is
it has this cutout detailing that's just
right here so it's not like a shoulder
cutout it's a cutout just right here
which I thought was really cute you
don't have to wear like anything
strapless with it because it doesn't
really show any straps under it but it's
just a really simple detail that's it
everything else you know it's a little
bit longer not quite like a tunic length
but it is a little bit shorter than that
but it does look nice with the jeans
I've worn it with leggings and it works
that way too but again it's not as long
as like a tunic length but other than
that really really simple really really
comfortable I'm keeping this one as well
because I feel like I when I look in my
closet I have so many patterns and like
I think maybe it's going to be nice to
have a staple I like pattern I just love
them but it is nice to have a mix so I'm
definitely keeping that next thing she
said you could layer this vest over and
I did ask for Murph did I ask for a vest
or I think that was just I had a bunch
on my Pinterest board I love the texture
of this it's kind of like that grayish
little bit of a texture to it it is a
little bit bigger than I like and so I
felt the tags on it I've worn it around
the house just to kind of try it out and
I just think it looks a little bit from
beyond me but not too frumpy and that's
why I'm kind of in-between because it's
just a standard one it's got this little
bit of I can't think of any like names -
I'm just really struggling to describe
this but you can see it it really is
cute but it's not as flattering as I
hoped and that's hard to find
I just haven't found a VESA platter I
just don't think they're flattering but
it still is really cute especially with
something really fitted underneath so
that's why I'm kind of torn I haven't
decided if I'm going to keep it or not
but it is a really cute vest and it is a
little bit longer the next thing was
this top and this one is totally a tunic
length and I worn it with navy leggings
I've also worn it with like these maroon
leggings I have and it's just this
really pretty kind of sleeveless I wore
it with like a navy blue blazer with the
maroon leggings one day it was actually
really cute and it's just a button-down
so you just wear a tank underneath it
but it goes down to a little bit past my
waist and I just love it I think it's
comfortable breezy I got a lot of
compliments when I wore it to work and I
think the patterns just fun and the
colors are totally like I could totally
wear this in the spring summer or fall
and it would totally work so that was a
definite piece as well the last item I
got was a necklace and I liked getting
different things and I love gold this
one I haven't decided if I'm going to
keep or not I like it I think it's
really pretty but I already have a lot
of statement necklaces and I feel like I
already don't wear them a lot but I do
love that the gold with it is kind of a
more brassy gold and that's why I
haven't yet decided because I want I do
kind of like that like that not like
that makes no sense but it is really
pretty Lauren might keep it I'm going to
try it with a couple outfits and decide
because I do like it the more I'm
thinking about it and I liked it it's
kind of a little bit more certainly not
neutral but like it's just all that
white so it can go with a lot of
different things actually the top I'm
wearing right now was in my last month
stitch fix box I will link that video
below if you're curious I kept
everything in last month's box I loved
it so much so if you want to see kind of
get a better idea of other things and
from what I understand you can ask for
specific pieces so like if you see
something I mention and I've got it in
the description box just copy it I'm
pretty sure you can ask them if they
have that in your size or they're still
selling that you know whatever and get
the exact one so clearly I love this box
if you're interested like I said I'll
have my referral link as well as the
normal link below if you want to check
it
how you do have to pay a $20 styling fee
but then like say you're keeping just
one of the items you can apply that $20
styling fee to that item so you don't
lose it the only way you lose that money
is if you get sent the box and you hate
all of it you send all of it back
you saw you still lost that 20 colors
does that make sense kind of like a
security deposit so hopefully this was
helpful and that you enjoyed it if
you're interested in more of my videos
please subscribe and tap that bell to
get notified wherever it is of when I
upload new videos and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
