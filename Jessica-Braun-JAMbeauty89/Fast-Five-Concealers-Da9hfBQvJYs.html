concealers which is one of my favorite
favorite favorite favorite things so I
have five concealers here that I
absolutely adore and would recommend to
anyone and I would kind of recommend
each of them for different reasons and
some are more expensive and some are not
so let's go ahead and dive right in one
of the first ones I thought of when I
thought of concealers that I loved were
the Maybelline instant age rewind
concealer 's now I have two different
shades and actually I'm out of one of
them but I have one that's in the shade
light which is shade number 20 and
that's just for like regular everyday
concealing and then I also have one
that's in number 60 which is the
brightener shade and this shade you
can't really see I might be able to
swatch a little bit of it but it's more
of a pink toned concealer if that makes
any sense so it's just gonna brighten
that area it looks really nice when you
even pair these together so maybe you
conceal first with the regular shade
that you would use and then use the
brightener shade on top of it after
you've already blended it in it's really
really nice nice and I think I actually
like the brightener more than I like the
concealer but these are just really nice
easily easy to blend there I think
around ten dollars depending on where
you are sometimes less than that and of
course you can always find sales but I
really really love these I would
recommend both but if you had to pick
one I would pick the brightener I love
it that's why I ran out of it quicker
than I run out of this and he's also
apparently well on their own so if
you're like why don't you just conceal a
little bit under your eye but maybe not
put foundation on these these guys blend
beautifully I love them so another one I
would recommend now this is a little bit
of a pricier one I think these are
around $26 somewhere around there that
was kind of a random number but it might
be right
um it's the benefit erase paste now this
I got it in the shade number one fair
and it's described as a brightening
camouflage for eyes and faced face this
is a kind of a peach or like a you can
kind of decide for you for yourself what
kind of color I think it's kind of a
salmon colored concealer now of course
it's probably being washed out right now
from the daylight but it's really really
nice it's a lot thicker than like most
concealers I've ever used it is the
thickest can see that I've ever use but
if you blend it really well I like to
blend it with a Beauty Blender it can
look really really nice you can use it
alone but I also like to usually pair it
with something else but it's it's pricey
and the thing is with concealer you know
you are gonna use it and I don't know
sometimes I don't like spending a lot of
money on pricey things that I can go
through really quickly I don't like
buying expensive mascara for that reason
I'm gonna have to throw it out in a
matter of months I don't want to spend
$20.00 oh no my scary you know I'm
saying so I would say it's not my Holy
Grail I don't know that it's necessarily
worth the money it's nice but I've heard
that there are dupes for this out there
I have yet to find them I've heard that
was it boots number seven they might
have a dupe for this it might be that of
some brand that sold at Target anyway
but I like it I mean it's not bad if you
find a good deal on it it might be worth
it if you like that thick salmon-colored
concealer
okay another favorite and this is a new
favorite for me is the Rimmel match
perfection concealer I have mine in the
shade 125 fair the way that it's applied
is just like a little brush tip and you
just kind of squeeze it and it goes up
into the brush and then you can apply it
um which is nice um it's not my favorite
way to apply concealer but I think I do
like this better than having to dip my
fingers in which I do with a few of
these so it's really really nice blends
well I like this on its own and in
conjunction with other things it's a
really nice brightening effect so I
really like this and by the way with all
of these I've never noticed creasing
with any of these concealers that I'm
showing you now I do always set all of
my concealers with like a powder like a
elf saw that sells a really nice one one
of their HD powders and I think they
even specifically sell no I know they do
an under eye setting powder for like
three to six dollars I'm not sure much
but elf sells them I mean every brand
under the Sun sells like a finely milled
powder that's translucent that you can
put over it or you can use the yellow
tone one which is what I use which is
also from ELF
so in this one I think is around like $6
something from rimmel okay so what am i
holy grail once you guys know this is
the covergirl and Olay simply ageless
concealer I use it in the shade 230
which is the eye corrector shade it's a
yellow tint
I will swatch this one it used to have
like a swirl but you just kind of you
know over time you lose it let's see
certainly a yellow tone I hope that's
showing through I love it it conceals
purple for my under eyes really really
well you know what I mean not purple
purple you ladies know what I mean I
don't know why I'm explaining myself to
you but I love it it's you can find me
some clearance right now I think it
target because they're apparently
redoing the packaging but even at the
regular price of like $12 it's worth
every penny and I've been using this
forever and I'm not even halfway through
and I use it almost every day because a
lot of times even if I'll use like one
of these concealers I'll put this on
underneath just because I love it and I
think it really does hide those dark
circles okay and then the hard candy
glamoflauge I hear people go back and
forth with this because it's only six
dollars first of all if I'm remembering
correctly it might be eight hard candy
is sold at Walmart and I have it in the
lightest shade I think there's only
three or four shades like light medium
and dark and maybe another dark one I
don't know maybe it's only three shades
but it's heavy duty I've heard of people
using this to cover tattoos I don't know
about that don't have any tattoos but
it's very it just you know squeezes out
it lasts I'm never going to go through
this but it's really great for those
days that you just need extra coverage
you know you can use it alone or in
conjunction it doesn't really matter it
blends well but a little tiny bit goes a
long way and I'm going to show you what
I mean
so I'm squeezing just like the tiniest
bit on my finger like the tiniest bit if
you can see that now I'm gonna try and
let's see right here tiniest bit I can
just blend and blend and blend and blend
I mean I could have covered like like
four eyes with that poor under-eye I
mean
just keeps going now it looks like it
doesn't blend well but it really does it
stays on all day it really is heavy-duty
really doesn't budge I really like this
it was like six bucks when I bought it
price might have gone up but I've had
this for quite a while I'm telling you
it's not going anywhere it's still like
full and I you've used a lot so those
are my top five concealers I would love
to hear about consumers that you love
please let me know down below and if you
enjoyed this give me a thumbs up or
subscribe and I'll see you guys very
soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
