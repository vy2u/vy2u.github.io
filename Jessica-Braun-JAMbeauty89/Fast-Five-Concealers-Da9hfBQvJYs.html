fast five on concealers which is one of
my favorite favorite favorite favorite
things so I have five concealers here
that I absolutely adore and would
recommend to anyone and I would kind of
recommend each of them for different
reasons and some are more expensive and
some are not so let's go ahead and dive
right in one of the first ones I thought
of when I thought of concealers that I
love were the Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer now i have two
different shades and actually i'm out of
one of them but i have one that's in the
shade light which is shade number 20 and
that's just for like regular everyday
concealing and then i also have one
that's in number 60 which is the
brightener shade and this shade you
can't really see i might be able to
swatch a little bit of it but it's more
of a pink toned concealer if that makes
any sense um so it's just going to
brighten that area it looks really nice
when you even tear these together so
maybe you conceal first with the regular
shade that you would use and then use
the brightener shade on top of it after
you've already blended it in its really
really nice nice and I think I actually
like the brightener more than I like the
concealer but these are just really nice
easily easy to blend there I think
around ten dollars depending on where
you are sometimes less than that and of
course you can always find sales but i
really really love these i would
recommend both but if you had to pick
one i would pick the brightener i love
it that's why i ran out of it quicker
than i run out of this he's also
parently well on their own so if you're
like wanting to just conceal a little
bit under your eye but maybe not put
foundation on these these guys blend
beautifully i love them so another one i
would recommend now this is a little bit
of a pricier one I think these are
around $26 somewhere around there that
was kind of a random number but it might
be right I'm it's the benefit erase
paste now this I got it in the shade
number one fair and it's described as a
brightening camouflage for eyes and
faced face this is a kind of a peach or
like a you can kind of decide for you
for yourself what kind of color I think
it's kind of a salmon-colored concealer
now of course is probably being washed
out right now
from the daylight but it's really really
nice it's a lot thicker than like most
concealers I've ever used it is the
thickest can see live ever use but if
you blend it really well I like to blend
it with a Beauty Blender it can look
really really nice you can use it alone
but i also like to usually pair it with
something else but it's it's pricey and
the thing is with concealer you know you
are going to use it and I don't know
sometimes I don't like spending a lot of
money on pricey things that I can go
through really quickly I don't like
buying expensive mascara for that reason
I'm gonna have to throw it out in a
matter of months I don't want to spend
twenty dollars what am I scared you know
I'm saying so I would say it's not my
holy grail I don't know that it's
necessarily worth the money it's nice
but I've heard that there are dupes for
this out there I have yet to find them
I've heard that was it boots number
seven they might have a dupe for this it
might be that of some brand that sold at
target anyway but I like it I mean it's
not bad if you find a good deal on it it
might be worth it if you like that thick
salmon-colored concealer ok another
favorite and this is a new favorite for
me is the Rimmel match perfection
concealer I am I in the shade 125 fair
the way that it's applied is just like a
little brush tip and you just kind of
squeeze it and it goes up into the brush
and then you can apply it I'm which is
nice um it's not my favorite way to
apply concealer but I think I do like is
better than having to dip my fingers in
which I do with a few of these so it's
really really nice blends well I like
this on its own and in conjunction with
other things it's a really nice
brightening effect so I really like this
and by the way with all of these I've
never noticed creasing with any of these
concealers that I'm showing you now I do
always set all of my concealers with
like a powder like a elf saw sells a
really nice one one of their HD powders
and I think they even specifically sell
know I know they do an under-eye setting
powder for like three to six dollars not
sure much but else sells them I mean
every brand under the Sun cells like a
finely milled powder that's translucent
that you can put over it or you can use
the yellow tone one which is what i use
which is also from el sol and this one I
think is around like six dollars
something from Rimmel um ok so one of my
Holy Grail once you guys know this is
the covergirl and Olay simply ageless
concealer i use it in the shade 2 30
which is the I corrector shade it's a
yellow tint I will swatch this one it
used to have like a swirl but you just
kind of you know over time you lose it
let's see certainly a yellow tone I hope
that's showing through I love it it
conceals purple for my under eyes really
really well you know what I mean not
purple purple but you go you ladies know
what I mean I don't know why I'm
explaining myself to you but I love it
it's you can find me some clearance
right now I think it target because
they're apparently redoing the packaging
but even at the regular price of like
twelve dollars it's worth every penny
and I've been using this for ever and
I'm not even halfway through and I use
it almost every day because a lot of
times even if i'll use like one of these
concealers i'll put this on underneath
just because I love it and I think it
really does hide those dark circles okay
and then the hard candy glama flage I
hear people go back and forth with this
because it's only six dollars first of
all if I'm remembering correctly it
might be eight hard candy is sold at
walmart and i have it in the lightest
shade i think there's only three or four
shades like light medium and dark and
maybe another Dark One I don't know
maybe it's only three shades but it's
heavy duty I've heard of people using
this to cover tattoos I don't know what
I don't have any tattoos but it's very
it just you know squeezes out it lasts
I'm never going to go through this but
it's really great for those days that
you just need extra coverage you know
you can use it alone or in conjunction
it doesn't really matter it blends well
but a little tiny bit goes a long way
and I'm going to show you what I mean so
I'm squeezing just like the tiniest bit
on my finger like the tiniest bit if you
can see that now I'm going to try and
see right here tiniest bit I can just
blend and blend and blend and blood I
mean I could have covered like like four
eyes with that court under eye I mean
just keeps going now it looks like it
doesn't blend well but it really does it
stays on all day really is heavy duty
really doesn't budge I really like this
it was like six bucks when I bought it
price might have gone up but I've had
this for quite a while I'm telling you
it's not going anywhere it's still like
full and I you've used a lot so those
are my top five concealers I would love
to hear back into is that you love
please let me know down below and if you
enjoyed this give me a thumbs up or
subscribe and I'll see you guys very
soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
