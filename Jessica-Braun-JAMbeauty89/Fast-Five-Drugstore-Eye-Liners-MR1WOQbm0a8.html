fast 5 video for you guys and I haven't
done a fast 5 video in so long I used to
do them and basically it's a video where
I pick a category today's category is
pencil eyeliner Zorba tractable
eyeliners and in the past I've done
blush concealer foundation and then I
think like summer lip products but I
basically feature my 5 favorite blushes
or my 5 favorite eyeliners so that could
be drugs or it could be high end usually
a mix I think all of these I know all of
these are drugstore though which is
great so today's video I'll be featuring
my 5 favorite at the moment now I might
have to update these 5 fast 5 videos
every year because really it changes and
it depends on what's still in my
collection and new things that will come
out so I think I will update these each
category each year so right now my 5
favorite eyeliners so we'll start with
my probably absolute favorite and these
are the Jordana 12-hour made to last
pencil eyeliners and these are amazing I
have them in quite a few different
shades these are amazing because they're
so inexpensive I think they might be two
dollars three dollars maybe and they
have a decent color selection and I'm
just gonna swatch the three that I have
I of course have the black and I need to
sharpen it though the thing is that they
get really soft so oh my gosh look how
pretty so the blue one is called aqua
stone the middle one and the dark green
is called Jade jewel and then the black
one is probably just called black or
something like that black point so I
love these they're inexpensive they're
so so creamy oh my gosh the black when I
use all the time and in fact I think
this is the second one I have owned of
this but I love them you can find them
at Walgreens definitely definitely
recommend another one that I like again
for their shade selection is the
Physicians Formula I don't really know
what these are called they usually come
in collections of three and this one
came in a set I think for what does it
say for this is from the set called warm
nude eyes and a lot of times it'll say
get this if you have hazel eyes get this
a few of blue eyes so it comes in sets
of three I've already
one of them from this set but so I don't
think they have names for them it's just
from that set but they're just they're
retractable the jordana ones by the way
obviously you had to sharpen but these
are just so pretty and if you like
shimmery eyeliners this one I haven't
really even used actually cuz it's a
little darker but they're just really
really pretty shades I think and you
know you can get Physicians Formula on
sale and you get a set of three for you
know under ten dollars it's not too bad
and especially since they're good
they're retractable and I really like
putting shimmery shades on my lower lash
line so for me I love it and the other
one I went through I think was a light a
lighter color like a lighter gold that I
love I want to rebuy that one
okay next favorite the essence
long-lasting eye pencil and these are
amazing I don't know if it's focusing on
it because it's honestly hard it's like
wearing off but this is in the shade
bling bling oh it kind of broke I've had
this for quite a while
and I love it because this is a gold
well I don't think it's the creamiest
format in the world this gold shade is
just my favorite and it's just a really
simple gold so it's not too shimmery but
again I wear it on my lower lash line
all the time for a little bit of
definition but not too much and not
totally naked under there you know what
I mean so I love this one I bought this
at Ulta and again it's like three bucks
or something like that another favorite
is this Palladio herbal precision
eyeliner now they have more than one
kind and the herbal precision ones are
my favorite the other ones I really
didn't like they were a little dry but
these are really creamy they look like
this if you can see it I don't know
maybe that'll help but this is in the
shade ultra violet and it's a beautiful
kind of I've never really seen in
eyeliner this color this one is kind of
like an indigo purple isn't that cool I
just thought it was a really cool shade
and they're so creamy so if you like
colored eyeliners again the black one of
this I think I've completely used up I
of course I go through black eyeliner
more than anything but they're so creamy
I really like them again really
inexpensive in the last one I'll talk
about is the Rimmel scandaleyes one now
I have it in the nude shade clearly and
I had it in black again I've used that
one up but the nude one is
worth noting because there's not many if
any of this tan shade of liner that's
completely matte out in drugstores
really at all you can use this if you'll
focus on me there we go you can use this
in your waterline there to kind of make
your eyes look bigger without it being
too stark white you know you can use it
to reverse lip line so you can put it on
the outside of your lips to help your
lipstick not bleed but also to really
make your lips pop now this one for me
since I'm fair it is you can tell a
little darker than my skin tone so for
something like that it doesn't work as
well I would really have to blend it out
so not as good
hey FedEx is here but something for me
anyway but I love this and the black one
was great these are really creamy but
what amazed me about the Rimmel
scandaleyes is that it really doesn't
once you put it your wand on it stays in
there for quite a while so if you use
black in your waterline I don't but if
you do this might be a good brand for
that because I don't notice this wearing
off very quickly so the black one might
be nice anyway so those are my five
favorite brands and types of eyeliners
all of these were drugstore which I
don't really own too many high-end
liners because you can find so many good
ones in the drugstore it's almost silly
to spend your money on it unless it's
like the most amazing one ever you know
I do own a few though but I hope that
was informative and enjoyable for you
guys and I'll catch you guys very soon
and if you're interested in my other
fast 5 video and I do have a Fast Five
playlist like if you look through my
playlist you can see the other ones I've
done in the past plus they're older
videos which is kind of fun cuz I think
I don't even know if I had the same
background really I think my room has
rearranged and I certainly didn't have a
scene camera but anyway so I hope I hope
you have fun reminiscing with me and
I'll catch you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
