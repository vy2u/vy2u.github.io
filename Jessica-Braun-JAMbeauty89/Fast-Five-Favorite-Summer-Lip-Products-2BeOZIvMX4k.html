to be featuring today in today's video
I'm gonna feature of my favorite
favorite favorite 5 lip products that
I've been using all summer long more
than any of the other lip products I
have they're just they've kind of become
my go-to products in the summer and I'm
excited to share them with you so um one
that I've been using all the time is the
Nivea lip butter specifically in
raspberry rose a kiss and what I love
about it it kind of has this like
interesting like kind of pinkish tone to
it and it's very milky when it goes on
but if you blend it in you know within
like the first thirty seconds it kind of
looks a little funky sometimes
especially if you have any like chapped
lips or anything like that but after
about a minute it really like sinks into
your lips and they're just look like
they're glowing and it's just such a
nice and it smells so so good if you've
never smelled this one well if you don't
like raspberries then you won't like
this but if you do it just smells
wonderful and has a really cool effect
on the lips so I've really been loving
this both alone and on top of other lip
colors and even under other lip colors
so another one is the Revlon I just
dropped it alright it is the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stain and honey
it's my all-time favorite color in the
line and I brought it up a lot but
what's so great about it is it is a lip
balm and you just roll it up as it gets
low you can just roll it up and on top
of that it stays on for so long so just
you know you can be out at the beach
you're out for dinner whatever put it on
you don't have to think about it you
don't have to worry about like sweating
it off or anything weird like that not
that you sweat on your lips but you know
what I mean
everything gets crazy in the summer like
you know so I really really love these
if you find a color you like then you
know awesome and honey is my favorite
color so another one is this other
speaking of balms is the l'oreal the
balm it's like the color riche bomb i
guess it is this SPF of 15 and send the
shade rose elixir shade wise I think all
of these are so like not
pigmented you know what I mean they're
so kind of sheer that it doesn't really
matter but this one has a little bit of
a pink tone to it but they kind of wait
yeah it kind of has a light smell a nice
smell but I just like these they're so
easy and they never make my lips feel
weird they really do feel like a bomb
and the packaging is really really cute
and I think these get overlooked really
easily and I really really like them so
that's definitely what I've been wearing
a lot and you don't need a mirror for it
which is always nice another one and
this is the one I'm wearing right now is
the Revlon lip butter in Juicy papaya
it's just such a pretty like orange
coral color without being too like crazy
you know I just really like it like I
said I'm wearing right now it's got it's
definitely got a pop to it especially in
person I'm looking in the mirror it's a
lot brighter in the person that it is on
camera but but it's really nice and
again it's it's juicy it's juicy papaya
so you can't even go wrong with it so
last one maybelline color whisper in
what color oh oh la lilac I can never
remember the name of this color but it's
one of my favorites because it's so it's
like such a cool purplish pink I hope
that's showing up because it is so it's
just a cool shade if you can see it it's
like a gumdrop or a bubblegum pink
pinkish purple lilac lavender there's so
many names for it I really like it and
it's different than most of the other
lip products I have color wise and then
the formula of the color whispers are
just really nice for the summer just
like the lip butters are just like the
color each balms are just like the other
lip butters are you know what I'm saying
these are all really really nice if you
notice none of these are like true
lipsticks if I wear lipsticks in the
summer which I do I usually will pair
them with some sort of balm like the
color each balm or even sometimes the
lip butter although this does kind of
change the color of the lipstick a
little bit so you know you have to keep
that in mind but these are my top five
favorite lip products I've been wearing
all summer long let me know what your
top five or top 20 for all I care I love
hearing about your guys's favorites so
