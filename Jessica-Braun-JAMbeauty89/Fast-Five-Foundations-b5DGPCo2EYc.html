going to be doing another fast v video
and today I'm going to focus on
drugstore foundations and if you're not
sure what fast v is this is my second
video in this series that I've created
basically it's where I feature 5
different products within whatever
category it is that I really really love
and would recommend so um like I said
today's drugstore foundation so let's go
ahead and dive right in so my first
foundation and this is my absolute holy
grail foundation the one that I
constantly go back to the one that I
constantly repurchase I can't even tell
you how many times I bought this
foundation it will probably come as no
surprise to many of you it's the Revlon
Colorstay for normal to dry skin I used
to get the combo to oily skin but it I
noticed that I would have some like dry
patches and places I would have just
kind of things like that it would wear
off kind of funky and then when I
finally decided maybe I should try the
normal to dry skin it was a world of
difference and this I noticed I mean I
have it on today it's just such a nice
finish it can have really full coverage
of it or not you can kind of sheer it
out if you use maybe a Beauty Blender to
apply it or just maybe apply it with a
light hand so that's what I love about
this and oh I just love it and another
tip another way to share this out would
be to add your own face lotion to it and
mix that together and kind of create
your own sort of tinted moisturizer and
it looks really nice mixed with I use a
thicker face lotion I've mixed it with
this and it looks really nice and it
wears along really well throughout the
day so definite recommendation I'm in
the shade 150 buff which I've been
forever and it kind of works in the
summer and winter so I think it's one of
those shades that I'm I go between so it
works kind of year-round which is really
nice another one is also Revlon and it's
their nearly naked foundation and I
would show you the bottle except for the
like titles like worn off but I I'm in
120 vanilla in this brand most of the
year and this is just such a nice
lightweight feel it's called nearly
naked for a reason
you put it on it's not I wouldn't call
it Dewey it's like right between do eNOS
and like Matt it's that perfect area in
between that I think wears off
beautifully throughout the day
well it doesn't wear off it wears
beautifully throughout the day and I
just love it and I'm I'm excited this
one's actually kind of running low I
think I'm gonna buy like a shade darker
through these summer months that are
coming up because I think this is a
fantastic summer fat foundation if
you're looking for one that's not so
heavy but it's not as light as a tinted
moisturizer this is perfect for you and
I think it's only like seven or eight
dollars at Target so it's not too
expensive for a foundation another one
is by Rimmel and I even heard like
anyone talk about this but it's the
Rimmel lasting finish foundation it's
said to be twenty five hours I have it
in 100 ivory which is the lightest shade
this there's hardly any color selection
so that's the downside I honestly think
this is almost too dark for me but I can
kind of make it work you know what I
mean depending on the year and things
like that but time of year that is but
this is also pretty inexpensive and I
really like it definitely if you have
very oily skin you probably won't like
this it does have a little bit of oil to
it but if you set it with a nice powder
it wears beautifully it has I've never
had a foundation with this type of
finish it definitely is a dewy finish
but like I said as long as you set it
with the powder
it's beautiful throughout the day it
doesn't get too oily I just really
really like it and this one really is
almost gone so I'm probably going to be
repurchasing this my only complaint is I
wish it had more color selection so
another one these next two have quickly
become favorites of mine and they're
both new to me and some of them are new
like to stores this is the wet wild
cover all Foundation and a lot of you I
posted pictures on Instagram and a lot
of you have asked you know do a review
and I might still do a review but for a
mini review I love this stuff I've only
applied it with the Beauty Blender so if
you're you know I don't know how it
would apply with just your fingers or a
brush and so I'll have to try that out
too before I do a review
but so far I'm loving it it is nice
coverage it can definitely be full
coverage but I would consider kind of
medium even though they call it the
coverall but of course I'm applying it
with the Beauty Blender so that's a
little bit different of a finish then
you would get with a brush or your hands
I love it we're sizing throughout the
day it's like four dollars people have
recommended this to me and I'm so glad I
bought it so if you're looking for a
cheap one I think you'll like it again
not as big of a color selection as I'd
hoped but it's still a really good deal
for the price okey so the next one I
just got I think yeah recently I did an
elf haul video and oh my goodness I am
totally in love I've never ever used
mineral foundation and I've always been
like like it seems like too much work
and like there's no way that's gonna
cover like the imperfections I want to
cover there's no way it's gonna wear all
day I had so many things that I was just
fading like no I'm not gonna try the
mineral foundation you guys it's from
elf it's their elf mineral foundation
like I said I have it in the shade light
and it's just like bare minerals or at
least what I've seen a bare minerals you
know it comes out of the thing I use my
ELF powder brush to apply this but you
can use kabuki brush I mean you can
really use any brush elf actually has a
nice $6 kabuki brush that I've seen at
Target and of course they also sell
online now this I did have to buy online
I've never seen it in stores but I can
link this down below this product I they
had a decent shade selection so that was
a nice surprise I'm sure I got the
lightest shade I'm sure I did maybe I
got a shade darker I'm not sure anyway
it has SPF of 15 and it is the most
beautiful finish it's not I don't know
how to describe it because you think
because it's a powder would be very
matte it's not it's like it's exactly
what I want on my face and this is
fantastic
alone but it's even better if you have
like a tinted moisturizer or a BB cream
that doesn't provide as much covers that
coverage as you'd like this is a
fan-freakin'-tastic combo this tinted
moisturizer / BB cream and you're in
heaven I swear to you I was so
pleasantly surprised
so definitely this is five or six
dollars it might have been six on their
website you can't beat that and it
actually it doesn't take very much
product and it actually is a lot of
product in there so I love it I'm
excited to try it even more and I'll
have to keep you guys posted on how I'm
loving it but it wears size either out
the day I think you guys would really
like it so those are my Fast Five
foundations if you enjoyed please
