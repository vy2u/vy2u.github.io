gonna resurrect this old video I used to
do called Fast Five I mean it's not that
old but when I'm back when I started my
channel over two years ago I started
this Fast Five series and then I just
kind of forgot about it and I'm actually
really excited to bring it back because
I have kind of a fresh insight on how I
want to do it this time around so
basically what it is is I try and keep
it around five minutes it always ends up
going over but I try and get around five
minutes this one might go over since I'm
restarting it but um I basically pick
five of whatever categories whether it's
some concealers or mascaras or today
we're doing highlighters but I want to
be more specific this time so this time
I want to do just drugstore highlighters
so it's kind of like my five drugstore
highlighters and I'm going to rank them
this time before I just mention them all
five and just told you what was good
about all of them
but this time I'm going to rank them so
I'm going to have my number five then
number four and it'll go down to number
one which is of course the one that I
would recommend the most that I love the
most etcetera so I am so excited to get
started so let's go and get into it so
my number five pick is a new one for me
and it's the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
highlighter I have it in the shade ice
they have two other colors make more of
a warm tone one and I think they have
more of a rosy tone one these they have
four shades that you essentially mix
together and they make you know a
highlight shade and what I like about it
is that they really are pigmented and
you can get one that really blends
better with your skin tone um but they
blend out pretty nicely my only downside
and the reason it's number five is that
I think that it's not I don't know it's
not as finely milled as a lot of the
other ones I'm going to mention are so
it doesn't look as natural like you know
where where some highlighters make you
look like wow like it looks glowy I
don't think this one does it as well and
one of the thing about this like I
mentioned it has four different shades
there's this kind of nude shade
right here that's almost more of a satin
finish that I think that alone is a
really pretty highlight so you know you
can kind of pinpoint that one and use it
because when you mix it with the blue
and the purple tones here it really
makes it even cooler tone whereas that
neutral shade is just beautiful on its
own but do I think it's still a really
nice highlighter yes and I think the
packaging is it might looking at them
this is my favorite packaging I think it
is so beautiful Oriole so good with the
rose gold and stuff they know what most
of us like so I think that's beautiful
would I buy another one of them like a
different shade maybe but probably not
because of the ones I'm going to tell
you about are just so much better but I
do like this one number four is the
Revlon highlighting palette in Rose glow
now this one I use more as a blush
topper and what I mean by that is when
I've got my blush on I'll use this since
it's got that rosy tone kind of on top
of it just to add glow and I might put a
little on my upper cheekbone but I'll
mostly just top that to make it almost
into a shimmery blush it's beautiful I
don't think wearing this like instead of
blush is enough because it's a really
light pink so unless you were really
really fair it wouldn't show up as well
but on top of blush I think it's really
really beautiful would definitely
recommend this especially if you're
looking for something more like that and
not necessarily a highlight color number
three is new to me which is crazy
because it's one of elf's like one of
those elf products that everyone else
loves but I hadn't tried it yet this is
the elf baked blush in pink tastic and
these are I think three dollars so
they're really they're probably the
cheapest I'm mentioning today this one
is like it reminds me of the mac
mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle
it's just this crazy shimmery beautiful
golden champagne colored highlighter and
they it blends really really nice you do
have to be careful because again it's
really really shimmery but because it
blends so beautifully you really can't
screw it up too much um I love this and
frankly I remember being turned off from
elfs baked blushes for a while because I
had gotten one and it was really really
dry but I think they changed the formula
because this is like butter and it might
look dry to you but it's
at all it's very very buttery so if for
some reason you've got a bad batch
double check because if yours feels dry
then you might have I don't know got a
bad batch because it really it should be
really buttery alright my number two
pick the number two number one almost a
tie and I was like no because there's
one that I know I love more number two
is the wet wild color icon bronzer and
reserve your Cabana and I always put in
quotes because this is not a bronzer for
I don't think anyone but it's this
gorgeous just satiny light color and it
ends up looking just like in my opinion
like the hourglass ones where it has
just a little bit of glow to it but
really there's no glitter almost no
detectable shimmer but it does something
to your skin where you just look like
you are lit from within and every time
I've ever worn this this is one that you
can wear here but you can also put down
your nose and right here and here and it
never looks like ooh you look weird and
shiny or you look oily it's always
perfect I can't believe this powder is
as cheap as it is I love this so much
and you if you've been watching me for a
while and you still haven't bought this
and you're near my skin tone you really
should buy it because it's so
unbelievable I need to buy a new one
because it does have SPF and it expires
this year so I think I'm gonna buy a new
one to get rid of this one cuz but I hit
pan on that's how much I love it look
how big this is and I get paying on it
that's crazy
my number one drugstore highlighter pic
and you're only gonna be able to find
this if you're near Walmart or you can
order from Walmart comm and I'm sorry
that that's the only place they sell but
this is the hard candy so baked bronzer
again bronzer in the shade Tiki and it
is the most I'm wearing this one today
it is the most beautiful highlighter I
picked this over like I've gotten girl
on meteorites
I picked this over that most day like I
pick it over Mac ones I have I love this
highlighter so much I think it's around
$8 at Walmart correct me if I'm wrong
but it's again a golden champagne
highlight it doesn't have like glitter
glitter it's just got these really
finely milled I mean I know I don't
think it has
litter it's just like oh my gosh I don't
know how to describe it but again this
has that beautiful like whoa like I love
the way that looks I wore this on my
wedding day again overall the high-end
ones I have this is the one I picked
because it is that unbelievable it is
that amazing so definitely recommend
this one again it can look dry because
it's baked and if you've been turned off
by baked products before try this one
because this one is even softer than the
elf one it feels like velvet when you're
rubbing your finger on it so I love this
so much I can't recommend it enough so
those were my top 5 picks for drugstore
highlighters I would love to know what
