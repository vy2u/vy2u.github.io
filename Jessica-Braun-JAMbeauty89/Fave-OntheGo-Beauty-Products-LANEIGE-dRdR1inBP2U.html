to share with you guys some products
that I am loving from the brand Laneige
you guys know I'm always up front with
you guys when I'm being sponsored in
this video is sponsored by lineage I
have fallen in love with quite a few
products at theirs and they've kind of
become my go-to when it comes to when
I'm on the go when I'm in a rush and so
I wanted to share some of those with you
and I talked about these products I will
show you me applying them so you can see
how they work how they look on my skin
or on my lips or whatever it is that I'm
applying so let's go ahead and get into
it so the one thing that's been living
in my purse for the past month or so has
been the Laneige cushion now they have
two different kinds they have their
hydra radiance and they also have their
pore filling my favorites the hydra
radiance i have i tend to have dry skin
although really my skin has not been
very dry lately which there's another
product i want to tell you about in a
second I've tried probably like 10 to 12
different cushion foundations and I've
liked some I haven't liked others but
this is my favorite and if you saw my
snap a couple of weeks ago I was talking
about this because I was just losing my
mind it's so good at hydrating your skin
but it also has enough coverage that you
feel like you actually are very put
together I feel like some cushion
foundations I've tried have not had very
much coverage and because of that I felt
like why did I even waste my time doing
that you know what I mean but with this
stuff I felt like wow like this looks
really nice and my skin looks good so it
was a win-win I love this for on-the-go
because I can pull it out of my purse
you know maybe I'm parked in my car I
can just dab a little bit maybe on my
nose or anywhere where I know that like
my nose always gets red throughout the
day so I can toss this on and it covers
it and my skin looks nice it doesn't
look cakey because I'm putting you know
something on top of old makeup
it always looks beautiful now they also
have a pore blur one which I really love
especially in my nose region because I
feel like that's where I have the most
pore problems and it really does a nice
job of just kind of blurring them and
kind of evening out that area if you've
got more oily skin I think you'd really
really like this if you've got more dry
skin you'd like this I think if you've
got normal skin you could go either way
like I said my skin
kind of more normal at this point and I
just like using both depending on where
on my face I'm putting it or just
depending on how my skin is that day
also side note and I had mentioned this
in my snap when you get the cushion it
actually comes with a full-sized refill
with it which is amazing because if
you've ever used the cushion foundation
you know once you run out you're like
man I've got to buy the whole thing
again but it's nice that you can just
replace the cushion in it and you can
keep the really cute compact to use and
what's awesome is they both have SPF of
50 so if you forgot that day or you're
like me and I'm always putting layers of
SPF on my face that is a huge win in my
book because our face it ages and the
Sun only makes it age faster so I
appreciate when companies put SPF in
their facial products the next product
is what I'm wearing on the lips and this
I have a favorite shade I've I've tried
all the shades and they're all beautiful
but this one's my favorite for summer
and it is their two-tone lipstick and
they come in this cute little white
packaging with the silver lid and the
idea is that it's a really quick kind of
ombre lip now you can apply it with
either color on the outside so for today
I applied this one in the shade number
seven cashmere nude I applied it so that
the peachy tone was on the outside and
it's like the simplest quickest way to
really make your lips look like you
tried really hard even though I
literally you just watch me do it just
swipe swipe swipe and it was done and I
feel like it makes my lips look like I
lined them but it looks like chic and
just beautiful and these are really
comfortable they don't feel if you've
seen any of my videos lately I'm talk
I've talked a lot about how I'm kind of
tired of matte lips on me I think look
beautiful on other people but I feel
like every time I wear and I'm like it
just makes my lips look older than they
are and I don't know they're just not
comfortable these have been my go-to
because they are comfortable they make
my lips look a lot more youthful they
you know all of those things that I feel
like I've been realizing about myself
this is the solution and I love it so
they also have like some really nice red
ones like this ones in red blossom and
it has like a peach and red tone it's so
pretty so you can see it's like new to
red they also have this dear
pink one that has like a peach and a
pink that's really really pretty you can
really go dramatic with these if you
want but either way you go these are
just amazing to toss in your purse
because they really do make you look so
much more put together and they feel so
good on your lips can't emphasize that
enough I want to talk about to skincare
type products that have completely
kicked out other skincare products out
of my bathroom cabinet because these are
unbelievable
okay this is one that I've heard a lot
of youtubers talk about and it's their
lip sleeping mask this I put on at night
but sometimes I put a little bit on in
the morning even though it's supposed to
be overnight because it feels so good so
like if I just get out of the shower and
you know I'm getting ready in the
morning
I will put some of this on my lips and
then kind of dab it off right before I'm
going to put on like an actual lip color
my lips are as smooth as a baby's bottom
they are so smooth but this really
shines you put a layer of it on at night
before bed it does its work it's magic
work overnight and when you wake up you
you're gonna look at your lips and think
what why are even more people talking
about this but like I said this has a
huge following here on YouTube for good
reason so it's this beautiful light pink
color
it smells like berries it frankly you
put it on your lips and you're like dang
I should go out like this because it
really looks pretty on your lips but I
wanted to read you some of the
ingredients of this if you are curious
so it has cranberry and blueberry
extracts vitamin C antioxidants o
raspberry and strawberry extracts as
well it exfoliates flakey skin it
reveals smooth I agree with all of those
claims this stuff if you haven't tried
it I know like kathleenlights loves this
stuff as well she was the first one I
saw that got this like on my radar and I
was like I want to trim them it is so
good so the next product I told you I
typically have dry skin but there has
been like a miracle worker that has
completely transformed my skin that
would be their water bank moisture cream
what is in this stuff it's so so good
I've tried well you guys know probably
like 75 to a hundred no exaggeration
creams for your face and this is the
first one I've tried where I've had some
that have been amazing but this is the
first one I've tried where I'm like whoa
I see it fixing my skin the second I'm
putting it on so it's this it's this
cream that's thick but not crazy thick
and I think that's what's so bizarre
about this
it's seemingly lightweight and yet you
can feel it kind of penetrating your
skin and the first day or night that you
use this I typically put it on at night
but like today I put it on before I put
on my makeup because I wanted you guys
to see what it does it sinks in but it
leaves this really comfortable feeling
on your skin and like you saw I put
makeup on on top of it and I feel like
my skin just is glowing and it's
moisturized so this one it has micro
hyaluronic acid it has magnesium
manganese did I say that right zinc
calcium potassium sodium but it also has
olives squalene squalane I've never not
got to say that one either
but squalane like you can buy just as it
is and put on your skin but it's so much
easier when all these amazing
ingredients are already mixed into an
amazing cream and then I'm not trying to
you know I'm like an apothecary in my
bathroom I've got all kinds of different
like ingredients but it's so much easier
to have it already ready to go and this
I feel like I no longer can claim that I
have dry skin because I feel like my
skin is just normal there's no flakes
anywhere none even my husband the other
day said your skin like I had no makeup
on and he was like your skin looks like
different like different in a good way
I hope he's like yeah like I feel like
it just doesn't look like as dry as it
usually does and I was like well then
thank you that's like the ultimate
compliment in my opinion anyway so I
have to attribute it to this is the only
thing I had switched up in my skincare
to have made that difference and I love
it I love it I don't I have so much
ginger I want to try but I don't foresee
myself wanting to move away from this
once I run out because it is so good and
so the packaging is like really hefty
and like heavy and nice and for me with
these two products I feel like when I am
in a rush and I'm gonna go run errands
we just moved into a house like a month
or so ago and which that's where I'm at
and I feel like more often than not I'm
waking up and I'm running to the Home
Depot or I'm running to some store and I
don't want to put on a full face of
makeup this has been amazing I even with
just this and no other makeup I'll toss
a layer of there moisture cream on my
face and then maybe a little bit of this
because I told you guys I just use it
all the time because I love it I'll toss
the bomb and I'll look in the mirror be
like wow and then I'll like throw on
I've got my glasses I'll throw on my
glasses and then I'm like alright like
I'm ready to go and I feel like even
though I don't have any makeup on my
face even just that makes me feel that
much more put together and I feel like
there's a protective layer on my face
and on my lips so that when I'm getting
you know just particles in the air
environmental pollutants all over my
face it's at least got a protective
layer as well so I will list all of
these products that I've mentioned from
one edge down below if you are
