to do a different kind of video today I
was inspired by another youtuber named
Kaylee bout I'm not sure how to
pronounce her last name I just started
watching her I will link her channel
below as well as her video but she did a
video about her favorite youtube videos
to watch and so I wanted to take that
and take it a step further and do my
favorite videos to watch but then also
my least favorite just things that
either annoy me or I just don't like
that kind of video so I'll try to
explain my thinking for both sides I
figure we'll start with my favorite
kinds of videos to watch I'll explain
why and then we'll get into my least
favorite so if you enjoy this different
kind of video give it a thumbs up
definitely subscribe and hit that little
notification bell so you are notified
when I upload new videos and let's go
and get into it under what's on my lips
I use the wet and wild gel lip liner in
plumb together and then I'm trying out
the bare minerals I think it's like
their matte lip color in oMG but
honestly it's like comfortable I was
kind of surprised it doesn't feel drying
so I was like and I just wanted like a
different kind of pinkish berry shade
today something different okay so I said
we'd get into the video and then we
didn't get into the video all right
so I've kind of typed my brainstorm list
here so my favorite video on YouTube
what I did first to kind of get inside
my own brain was I went to my watch
later playlist
I used that like crazy because that is
where I like if I've got like 10 I look
at my subscription feed and I'm like ooh
there's like 10 videos I don't watch I
hit the watch later on all of those and
if you didn't know how to do that if you
hover over a videos thumbnail in the
right corner you'll see like a little I
think it looks like a clock that
automatically adds it to your watch
later so then when I'm ready to sit down
I'm like watch videos whether I'm just
in here and just vegging or I'm like
getting a bath and I'm watching it I
will just click on watch later and play
all and it'll just play them in order
and those are all videos I'm interested
in watching it's really nice I'm kind of
similar to like when you do like the Q
on YouTube if you're like chrome casting
or whatever anyway so I went to that
playlist first and what I noticed was I
probably like 25 videos on there right
now most of them are declutter videos
it's I just love to clutter videos and I
think it's because I myself like to
declutter they inspire me but also it's
a great way to
here about a bunch of different products
and if they like them don't like them
and why and so it's like tons of reviews
all in one so that's probably my
favorite video to watch anyway I also
love videos and I know I'm not alone in
this that are like top 5 or bottom 5
videos so if it's like top 5 drugstore
highlighters are best and worse you know
those kinds of videos I again myself do
because I myself am interested in them
so you'll kind of notice a theme I don't
like to film videos that I don't like to
watch because I mean I guess it kind of
just makes sense right so I really like
that kind of video and I think it's it's
nice when there's a number I know how
dumb that sounds but I think all a lot
of our brains work that way where it's
like top eight drugstore palate so I'm
like ooh okay so there's eight I can
learn or top five like I like when
there's a number two and I want to do
that more often on my channel but yeah
so that's something I'm weird about but
I really really like especially when
there's a number I always watch it I
also really like brand overviews so if
it's like Maybelline best and worse or
covergirl bests and where I'm like only
saying drugstore Too Faced best it works
you know whatever Giorgio Armani I'd be
a lot of Armani products to try to do
the best and more some but anyway I like
those kinds of things again - only if
the person has been trying them out for
a while if it's like a best and worse
but they just bought all this stuff I'm
like mmm oh you know if you like it like
but I don't get that and I feel like a
couple years ago I might have done
videos like that and looking back I'm
like I'm glad I've kind of learned from
that because I don't think they're very
beneficial if my job is to give you guys
the best information that I can and to
really give you my honest opinion on if
you if it's worth spending actual money
on or not then I think it's my job to
really try these out that's clearly like
a torch I'm carrying right now it's not
the right phrase for that I don't think
it is but you guys get what I'm saying
like that is like my crusade right now
is to really thoroughly know a product
before I try to give you my opinions and
that brings well that I'll touch on that
in a little bit when I get to what I
don't like watching I okay I love
holiday gift guide videos love them this
girl
Jen who I've watched for years her
channel is called pretty neat living now
it used to be like organized by Jen
anyway
she recently had a kid and I think she's
about to have a second but she for years
has done these like this set of gift
guides where it's like one is stocking
stuffers and the other and so they're
like small little things for cheaper and
then one is extravagance largest so
really expensive and I even though I
never buy anything I love watching them
oh my gosh so any kind of gift guide and
then I also like kind of in that same
vein love watching like sale like vib
sale recommendations because those are
amazing to watch any time of year
because like those are products that
that person genuinely loves that they
would recommend that they've tried i
like watching like wishlist videos and i
do those myself too just because it kind
of gives me an idea of what's out there
and so those can be fun but i think i
prefer just like the recommendations and
I don't think I did a Sephora
recommendations video this year and
maybe I'll work on that for like the end
of the year by the way I was thinking
about I usually every year do my jammy
Awards like in January of like my whole
you know 2017 what did I love what did I
hate bah blah so I was thinking about
doing a high-end one a drugstore one and
then just my least favorites from the
year so like three different videos I
think I used to do I've done some years
where I just do it all in one video I've
done some years where I do eyes in one
video lip someone I don't think I want
to do it that way so I let me know below
what you'd prefer I think it'd be fun to
do a high end version a drugstore
version and then just my least favorites
across the board just for something
different but I love to in those videos
I usually go back through my like
favorites videos throughout the year
things like that and it's kind of fun to
reminisce as well and then I also like
any kind of organization videos so ones
where it's like I'm gonna organize my
closet or I'm gonna organize my desk
drawers or my purse or you know what I
freaking love those videos I don't know
in it I know I'm not alone in this I'm
just such a weirdo I love watching
people organize things alright and
there's probably more that I love as
well but I if I talk about all min I'll
take forever so let's go and get into my
least favorite my least favorite have
become and this is
Neuer to me but my least-favorite has
become first impressions now it's not to
say that I've never done them I have
definitely done them and it's not to say
that I will never ever do them again but
I myself don't like watching them
because I don't like I mentioned earlier
they're just not that beneficial its
parts of it are so the redeeming
qualities the first impressions are if
it's a new product and you're dying to
know about it right off the bat and you
can't go in the store and put it on your
eye if it's a drugstore product for
example there are those redeeming
qualities where at least you get to see
someone putting them on see them swatch
so at least you have a really good idea
if you're wanting to get them when they
first are coming out that makes sense to
me but I think if you do that you should
follow it with some kind of a you know
update video a month or two later where
you say okay those are my initial
impressions here is now how I feel about
them but just doing the first impression
part or like for example hauls I love
watching hauls but if there's no haul
update to go with it there's no
follow-through and maybe that's the
teacher in me I've recently started
doing haul updates and I feel so good
about it because I'm like yes that's the
follow-through and the consistency you
need because if you're subscribing to
someone and you watch them all the time
you're gonna see the hall and you're
gonna see the hall update it's not like
will suddenly miss it and so I feel like
that's so important because just the
first impressions isn't enough it's
helpful in seeing the swatches and
getting an idea but it's not enough to
decide like if this is a forty dollar
foundation and a fifty dollar pallet
from that brand and a thirty dollar
eyeliner in a $20 mascara I want to know
how they work after you've tried it for
a long time too before I'm gonna go and
spend $40 on the makeup or $50 you know
what I'm saying I think I'm over
explaining it but that's kind of my
feelings on that PR hauls I've done them
on my channel but I just think it's so
hard that you know you're tiptoeing that
line of like you don't want to seem
ungrateful but you also want to be
honest so like I don't want to say oh
it's great because they sent it to me of
course but I also don't want to seem
ungrateful and so it's like oh my gosh
it's just too messy I would rather
review the product through other videos
on my channel if they're not into
sing to me then so be it I've done like
I recently did like just a daily like
day in my life kind of a vlog which I
can also link below there's gonna be
like a million videos linked below
um where I just kind of showed a little
bit of unboxing but it was not just to
show what it was it was more just say
hey this is this new brain I've never
heard of you guys heard of it and I just
showed a little bit and talked about who
the founder tree you know what I'm
saying so it was more for an
informational standpoint but I've seen
some PR hauls that I'm like you know I
think I'm done watching them for a few
reasons
a I'm gonna be honest sometimes it makes
me jealous and I myself get PR packages
I have no reason to be jealous so I can
only imagine someone that doesn't get
them that feeling and I know that's
terrible
I know it's terrible of me and I
shouldn't be jealous but I'm just trying
to be as real as I can be there is that
little bug in me that I'm like oh my
gosh like I wish that brand sent me
stuff how dare I think that right and so
I'm like if I feel that way I can only
imagine other people now I know not
everyone has that jealousy bug I wish I
didn't have it in me but I do so for
everyone else that's not a problem and I
know some people love PR hauls and when
I stopped doing that people like know I
love them but I think for that reason I
just could they kind of just worn off
their magic on me and I'm like you know
I don't always love watching them
everyone smile I'll click on one but I
don't know I usually kind of click
through it and just look for brands I'm
interested in or products and then just
not watch the rest I don't know I'm
curious what are your guys has thoughts
on them I don't know anyway all right
let's see next thing oh my gosh I am
proud to say that I don't think I've
watched a single video where it says
world's first this or world's best this
I don't think I've seen I clicked on a
single one because I'm like this is so
like I don't know I hope I never seen to
that level it's not to say that I've
never said like I think this might be
the best hilar I've tried because if I
genuinely think that I'm gonna say it
but to say world's this this my first of
all have you tried everything in the
world I can say something is the best in
my opinion but to say it's the world's
best something come on like that is
treating us like we're idiots I don't
know and again it's my own little thing
it's my own feelings that's what this
is about but I don't know why that
bothers me it just bothers me
does it bother anyone else world's first
is a little bit more forgivable because
I'm like well if it really is the
world's first of whatever then okay but
the world's best one really just bothers
me I'm gonna get over I got some issues
to get over apparently okay the last
woman to mention is gonna be really
controversial that I'm even saying this
I really don't watch tutorials and it's
not that I know everything cuz holy moly
I have so much to learn I'm not a makeup
artist I'm not like professionally
trained I'm just someone that likes
makeup so I i watch tutorials every once
in a while like once every three months
but I really don't watch them and I
don't know if it's because so many of
them I'm like I just don't feel like it
pertains to me it's like some crazy bold
colorful look that looks beautiful on
them but I'm like I'm never gonna like I
don't have the desire to wear that on my
face it's not that I think it would look
ugly on me or that it's ugly on others
that's not what I mean it's just I know
my own taste and what I do in my own
life and how I like to look when I go
out and that's just not it and so for me
and I don't think I'm alone in this I
just don't watch him I'm not interested
in them everyone smile I'll be like an
everyday look like oh that looks pretty
I know usually it's not how do they do
it it's usually like what products of
these I'm curious about what did they
use to do that um everyone smile like if
there's some new trend I'm like how do
you do that Oh watch that but I really
don't and that's why you know a lot of
you guys are like why don't you do
tutorials I've started to everyone so
well at least show how I'm applying
products when I'm talking about
reviewing the product but I don't do
like full-blown tutorials all the time
I'll typically do get ready with me
because I didn't get ready with me so I
can talk to you guys we can talk about
the products I'm using but tutorials is
more about the application and technique
and I'm like I don't feel like I have
that good of technique so I'm sure if I
watch more tutorials like no but but I
just don't I'm not interested I know
that sounds probably so backwards this
of you guys but it's just me and I can't
help it
so I hope this video was enjoyable to
watch maybe illuminating on maybe
thoughts you have in your head but
you've never put them the words to them
or maybe you felt the same way and
you're glad I someone else does or maybe
you're like what are you Jessica you're
insane why do
watch this or I love this video or I
hate that kind of video um let me know
your thoughts below we can get a
conversation going cuz I think this is
just kind of a fun topic as there are so
many videos that are constantly repeated
on YouTube some of them I'm really
interested in some of them I'm not like
I used to watch a lot of makeup
collection videos I really don't watch
those anymore I'd rather watch two
clutters because I feel like makeup
collections kind of gloss over them now
everyone small get in the makeup
collection mood where I really do want
to watch them and I'll just watch them
on repeat for like days but then I get
out of that mood so those are kind of
one that I've got to be in the right
mood to watch you know so I hope you'll
subscribe if you did enjoy this video or
you enjoy my awesome personality
stoppage as you're being an idiot
anyway um alrighty I'm gonna go eat my
coffee up cuz it's gotten cold and I
will see you guys in my next video
