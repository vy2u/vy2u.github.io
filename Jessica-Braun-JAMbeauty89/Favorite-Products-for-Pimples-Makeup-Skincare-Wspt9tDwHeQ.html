doing a video I've never done on my
channel and it came to me a couple weeks
ago because I had a horrible break out
it's actually right there and it's
covered for the most part today but it's
been around for three freaking weeks but
I do have things that can kind of help
and I'm excited for this video because I
know that the comments section is gonna
be awesome
what I'm gonna share with you are the
products makeup products skin care items
things like that that I use when I'm
breaking out now here's the thing I am
NOT a dermatologist I'm just a girl that
loves makeup and skincare so I don't
know everything I wish I did but I don't
so with that in mind please give us your
expertise in a constructive manner down
below because if you know certain things
about certain ingredients like I said I
don't know everything and I want to
learn I'm willing to learn and I'm open
to learning okay calm down Jess we get
it so with that being said let us know
what products you love whether it's
skincare makeup whatever I'll link
everything I mentioned down below show
you close-ups of the products things
like that and explain how I use them on
my face so if you enjoy this kind of
video or you like beauty videos
definitely subscribe to my channel I
hope that you'll give it a thumbs up
let's go ahead an get into it alright so
I'm so excited can you tell I don't know
why of it like I'm looking at all these
products that like bring me comfort when
I've got a breakout now I'm being
dramatic I've been very blessed I don't
have and I've never had true acne I'll
just have flare-ups and breakouts so if
you're someone that does suffer from
that and you need something stronger
than these things you might get an idea
or two but you know this is not
necessarily gonna fix all of your
problems I wish I had the answer to that
as well alright so I'll stop preface it
I kinda thing way too much so let's
start with some skincare things and then
I've got a bunch of makeup items I use
to cover breakouts to help heal
breakouts as well things like that so
skincare wise I'm just gonna mention a
few things that I they're kind of
tried-and-true favorites one of these is
this item from Paula's Choice it's their
calm redness relief it's a BH a lotion
exfoliant a lot of times if you're new
to skincare you hear the word exfoliant
and you think of something with beads
that you're kind of rubbing against your
face and I say beads so most of the time
nowadays it's like little granules that
feel like sand or show
this is not that kind of a thing this is
a chemical exfoliant there's a lot of
research you can do between Ajay's and
PHAs and what's right for your skin I
feel like both of them work on my skin
but basically it's alpha hydroxy acids
and beta hydroxy acids so this is a beta
hydroxy acid but the idea behind this
specific product is it says it gently
minimizes pore size and smooth skin for
me I do get you know even when I'm not
breaking out just redness just general
redness my nose is always red but
especially my cheeks and when I'm good
about using this every single night in
my routine I feel like it really does
make a difference in the mornings when
I'm getting ready and I look at my
cheeks and I feel like oh my cheeks
aren't that red but then when I stop
using it for a few days I do kind of
notice it start to kind of go back to
what it was so and like for me I've got
freckles and things like that that just
kind of connect and they look redder as
well so when you add both of those
together I do feel like I need to cover
it up or at least that I want to cover
it up so I really really enjoyed this
stuff in this lasts quite a while which
I appreciate the next item is a mask I
like to use this is from nug I like all
of their masks but when I'm specifically
breaking out this one is they're
soothing face masks for me I feel like
when I've got one breakout or a couple
that I feel like my whole face is about
to explode and so I'm kind of trying to
stop it in its tracks and I'll show you
something specifically for those
breakouts but this is these are the
kinds of things I like to use for my
entire face just to help prevent it
because that just means I'm stressed out
maybe I'm not eating healthy or I'm not
exercising enough or I'm not getting
enough sleep or I'm stressed out
whatever it might be that's causing the
breakouts or maybe they're just hormonal
I like to try to stop them in their
tracks and help the rest of my face get
back to normal as well so the soothing
face face mask from numb you could
totally get two uses out of this a lot
of times my husband and I will just
share one of these and just kind of
stick it all over but they're really
really good they have them for all
different kinds but the soothing one is
one of my absolute favorites it just
calms my skin down again it kind of
helps with the redness as well next skin
cure item is I have two two cleansers to
mention I just like to scrape my
lipstick off onto my finger this one
which is completely the same as my
favorite which I don't currently have so
my favorite face wash of all time it's
the most gentle its effect
but it's gentle and it doesn't strip
your skin but it actually cleans it and
doesn't you know irritate it it's the
serum a hydrating cleanser I'll put it
on the screen right now and I'll link it
below it's my absolute favorite
I ve bought it like a million times and
when I'm using that I feel like I get so
much less break out issues than when I'm
using something else and actually I
recently tried a Garnier one and I was
just breakout city and I switched to
this one which is absolutely it might be
the exact same product as that Sierra
may want it's the equation gentle
massaging cleanser they both have
ceramides and hyaluronic acid in them
and they just both have this kind of
weird feel like when you start mixing it
with water it's like a I don't want to
say putty that's not the right word but
just so really weird hydrating almost
lotion like feel but it feels so good
and it doesn't dry my skin which I
appreciate so love this and I love this
year of a one alright so for breakouts I
have two items I like to use I actually
had to steal this back from my husband
because I gave him this and then I
missed it for this last breakout it's
the Mario Badescu drying lotion this has
gotten a lot of heat and like I said I
don't know enough the reality is the
main ingredient is alcohol isopropyl
alcohol and so it definitely dries out
your skin you have to be very choosy
about when you decide to use this but
for me this one was one of those big
under the skin throbbing painful
breakouts and I thought this is gonna
take forever to finally come to the
surface and I don't pop zoom zits
I mean that's disgusting to me and it's
so bad for your skin but this will dry
it out
some people say overnight it does not
work overnight for me but I will say two
to three nights and it's dried out and
that means it's not in pain anymore it
might still be red because it's still
there but it's kind of on the way out if
that makes sense so for me it kind of
just speeds up the process the Mario
Badescu is really weird because you take
a q-tip you're not supposed to shake it
up I've been moving it around but this
is usually clear and then there's like
this pink almost likes clans do you guys
remember the sand that you like you'd be
in water and you pull it out and it's
magically dry it was like a kid's thing
I loved it it's kind of like squint
because you dip your q-tip in
the clear part all the way down to the
pink powder and all the way back up and
then you apply it and whatever it is all
together you're just not to let shake it
I remember the very first time I got it
I just check it right up and it
literally says do not shake solution so
it's a very bizarre product but I in my
opinion very effective another thing I
like if it's not a complete under the
skin one is this from origins it's their
super spot remover it's an acne
treatment gel which really it's just
salicylic acid what percentage is this
it's 1.5% so I think they have stronger
cells silica acids out this just happens
to be one I really really like and I
just literally well you squeeze it and
it comes up and if your fingers are
clean you can just tap it on I like to
use a q-tip and just tap it on the area
again it dries it out they also have
benzoyl is it benzoyl peroxide is the
other kind of ingredient that's good for
fighting acne and that's also available
in the drug so I'll link the one I've
used I think it's like the is it
Neutrogena I'll link the one I've used
in the past I just don't currently have
that I do feel like works you kind of
got to figure out which works better for
your skin salicylic acid or that I'm
sure there's other ones too but those
are kind of the two main ones all right
let's keep cruising let's move on to
makeup so my favorite primer to use when
I am breaking out is from cover FX it's
there calming primer as I'm looking
around I'm kind of realizing a lot of
these things I'm mentioning are
expensive but I feel like I haven't
found certain products in the drugstore
that that work as effectively as these
do so you know this is a little bit more
affordable so is the other cleanser the
nog masks start too bad but I do feel
like a lot of these are more expensive
and I didn't I certainly didn't do it
intentionally I just feel like these are
genuinely the products I use so I wanted
to be honest with you guys and not pull
drugs or things just to have them if I
don't genuinely feel like they help my
skin during that time so anyway this is
the cover FX calming primer I just feel
like I put it on my skin and again with
that redness it just soothes everything
it feels so nice it's still effective
I'm holding onto makeup now isn't gonna
be as long wearing it's like one of
those like really you know Dometic own
velvety kinds that are pore filling
probably not but I do feel like it still
does a really good job but most
importantly it kind of is another layer
of soothing
detection on my skin next would be
foundation now typically when I'm having
a really bad breakout
I don't want to put something
full-coverage on that's just gonna make
my skin look worse than it already does
and look cakey I know some people like
to really layer stuff on I just don't I
I feel like it makes it worse and it
draws more attention because then it's
drier and gross and creepy and people
like look at it I'd almost rather it
just be red and obvious but so for the
rest of my face I love BB creams these
are my two favorites this is the Misha
perfect cover BB cream it's kind of got
this gray tone they only have a few
shades which is unfortunate but I liked
you know I just put it on with my
fingers and then I might grab a sponge
to blend a couple of like harder to
reach areas but honestly with both of
these I put them on with my fingers I
also like the dr. jart
beauty balm they're both really really
good they have decent coverage enough
that you don't feel like you didn't put
anything on your face but not so much
that it's gonna add to dryness or
creepiness I really I feel like these
leave the life in your skin and your
skin can still breathe but it looks more
perfected than it does without it
alright the next thing is the powder I
go for which is the maybelline superstay
better skin this actually has salicylic
acid in the powder I don't know how they
do it but that's what it says I need to
get a new one but first of all I just
love it has a big mirror so if I'm
touching up throughout the day it's
perfect but it's got this little sponge
with little air pockets so you can air
holes so it can kind of dry out and not
breed bacteria but the powder is really
good coverage I'm actually wearing it
today but again it's not terrible for
your skin it says it's our first powder
with salicylic acid that wears all day
it reduces the appearance of
imperfections pores and unevenness
dermatologist tested for safety and so I
just feel like it's it's just nice like
I said I'm wearing on my skin today and
I feel like it really does perfect those
areas that are maybe red it covered this
breakout really really well and I'll
show you the concealer I use as well but
I really like this powder I like it even
when I'm not breaking out but especially
during that time all right I have two
concealers to mention one is this it
cosmetics bye bye breakout full coverage
treatment concealers so they said it's a
treatment concealer so supposedly it has
and of course
I don't have the info card but it's got
some treatment stuff in it but of course
it's also a concealer I think it's cool
there it's a little jar and you pull the
dough foot out do I think this is the
highest coverage concealer out there no
I really don't but the fact that it has
some ingredients that could help is why
I like to use it and it never ever looks
crepey on my skin ever and that is huge
so I feel like it reduces the redness do
I think it completely covers it like I
said no but it doesn't make it look dry
and gross and crusty and I think that's
really really cool
so this is one of my favorites I have it
in the shade light but I've just
absolutely fallen in love with this and
this is a newer fine for me but if you
want more coverage the laura geller the
real deal concealer is the real freaking
deal it literally says on the back use
sparingly so the idea is that you're not
supposed to blend this all the way out
so it's just a squeezy tube and you know
it's a thicker concealer and you just
kind of I usually just kind of tap it in
place and then I'll usually use a brush
because I feel like a sponge completely
blends it away but if it's a really bad
break out like the first few days I was
using this not the bye-bye breakout this
really does a great job of getting the
redness away the best way to deal with
this is to take a powder you could use
the better skin powder and just kind of
I'll just use this sponge and just kind
of put it on top of it because that's
gonna set that really nicely and so that
it's not gonna move you could also use
loose powders but it really does perfect
the area and yet again I don't feel like
this one ends up looking super dry or
creepy either however I think the one
that looks the least dry is the bye-bye
breakout from it cosmetics another item
I just thought of by the way that is
drugstore is the hard candy glamoflauge
concealer is totally a dupe for this
Laura Geller I haven't used it in years
but it just crossed my mind I'm like oh
yeah that stuff is I swear to you the
same exact stuff so if you were thinking
about getting this you wanted a more
high coverage thick concealer that one
is amazing and it's under $10 I want to
say it's like six to eight dollars
somewhere in there so I can link that
below as well alright two more items
I've got the it cosmetics bye bye
redness this one threw me off because
is it's so dark but like it takes care
of your skin there are different shades
I don't know if they always use have
different shades but this stuff I'll put
on like especially my nose and it will
completely get rid of redness and then I
can put foundation on top of it so if
you end up like I said with breakouts
where your skin starts to look red as
well this is a great job of canceling
out redness so you can put it all over
your face you can put it in strategic
areas I don't think it's meant to be
necessarily like a spot concealer I
think you could probably use it as one
so if you feel like you'd use this more
as both like it areas of redness and for
spot concealing it might be more worth
your money to get this because I feel
like it kind of does both but it's
called a neutralizing correcting cream
and I really do feel like this does an
amazing job at staying in place covering
redness when I want to look my most
flawless I'll put this on my nose and
it's gone do I want to wear it everyday
no I think it's expensive and you know I
don't know how great this is for your
skin so if you're just clogging your
skin with this every single day I don't
know I guess how is that any worse than
foundation right I don't know but I I do
think it's really effective the last
thing this kind of I should have put
with the skin care but this is something
I travel with all the time it's the elf
acne fighting gel again it's just a
little salicylic acid treatment it's 1%
instead of like the 1.5 from this
origins one but it's just a quick little
rollerball and so like for me I'll get
little break it's on my nose just all
the time and so I'll just dot it on
there let it sink in then I'll put
primer on foundation but I think it's
just a great daily treatment I don't
trust this just like as my sole
treatment for a pimple but I think it's
great to just toss on in the morning if
I were to put this on in the morning it
does end up like having it like a ring
around the area where it dried whereas
this is a lot more I don't know like a
viscous so it just it kind of just
blends right into it and it just kind of
goes away if that makes sense and so
then I can put primary foundation and it
doesn't look weird but I do feel like at
least I got something in there for the
daytime which i think is cool and this
is so so cheap so those are all of the
items I thought to mention of today I'm
sure there are many more than I use that
I just you know or just under my radar
today but let us know down
like I said any suggestions
recommendations expertise that you have
about breakouts and how to treat them
and what it's what are some good makeup
to use over it other than that if you
