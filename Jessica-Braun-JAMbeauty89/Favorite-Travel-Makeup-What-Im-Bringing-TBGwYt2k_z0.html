you guys what I'm bringing in my
toiletries bag and my tsa approved like
clear bag I'm carrying on for a two week
trip to Ireland in Spain and so I my
husband's the travel agent we travel all
the time so I've kind of gotten better
about bringing a lot less or bringing
products that can do more than one thing
and so I will link this this is from
Amazon it is the best clear bag the
zipper is so strong you can fit way more
than you probably should be able to fit
in but I've never gotten stopped by the
TSA so I'm like whatever this is great
so I will link this below because it's
unbelievable and it's not too too
expensive obviously it's more expensive
than just buying a ziplock but this is a
V R Bradley kind of like hanging
organizer and I love this because I can
fit everything I've got my makeup down
here brushes here and then all my other
toiletries here so we'll go through
every single thing why I'm bringing it
and yeah let's go and get into it so
let's start with the TSA bag because I
know a lot more people have questions
about that more than anything about like
what especially makeup wise what needs
to be in here and what doesn't so let's
go through this and I will show you
everything and kind of repack the bag
here okay so first thing toothpaste they
sell bigger toothpaste now this size two
and a half ounce which i think is
fantastic I love the crest 3d white
sunscreen this is this B or a UV aqua
rich watery essence my friend Laura told
me about it's amazing I only use it on
my face but you can totally use it
everywhere it's kind of pricey to get
here in the US but I bought it on Amazon
and I can link this below it's the best
non-greasy SPF I've ever used on my face
so I love that this is my favorite
moisturizer and I just found out they
sell it in this size it's the CeraVe
hydrating cleanser so that is going face
skincare is one thing that I don't slack
on when I travel I could easily because
it would save me space but I don't
because when you travel that is when
everything falls apart with your skin
and so I really try to bring as much as
I can so speaking of skincare this is
the Clinique take the day off this is
actually it was empty and I had my
the big version of this and I literally
just scooped it out and filled this so
that's what I've been doing that way I
don't have to bring cotton pads with
this at all nothing else it's not a
liquid even though really you know this
is probably one I could probably get
away with not putting in here but I do
anyway just in case this is the coda
leave you know source moisturizing
sorbet I love this stuff it's great for
moisturizing at night but also in the
morning because it looks great under
makeup so I love this for that and
that's actually the full-size this
little cotyledons the birthday gift at
Sephora I love this it's their vino
perfect serum and I use this every
single day the full-size so I was so
excited that this is a birthday gift
because it's travel friendly they also
had that in the smaller size but I
figure I might use a lot of that ahh
this is the eye cream I'm bringing it's
the origins ginseng eye cream just a
nice small little pot I'm also bringing
my favorite hairspray the bedhead
masterpiece I love this stuff I'm also
bringing this a mica dry shampoo because
that's one of those things that I could
easily not bring dry shampoo I might
have to like rethink this organization
here but I don't like to not bring it
because that's the thing I end up
needing the most just because if we're
in a hurry to get out that morning I can
just throw some dry shampoo in and be
good to go alright I'm also bringing
setting spray again this is one I didn't
have to bring that I told myself if I
have the room I'm going to bring it
because I do think it makes a difference
and how long your makeup stays on
throughout the day if you're out
sightseeing and things like that I'm
bringing a body cream we are not staying
in a hotel we're staying in Airbnb
everywhere we go that's how we typically
travel and so there's probably not just
gonna be lotion sitting there one thing
that you're not gonna see in here is
shampoo and conditioner my husband's
bringing a travel-size in his but most
places have that even at Airbnb I've
noticed they'll usually still have
something but he's kind of just bringing
it just in case we also could just go
this is what we've done when we're
traveling for a while we'll just go to
the store and buy shampoo and
conditioner there it's just some cheap
stuff and then when we're going home
we'll just leave it because you know
it's usually you can find it for pretty
cheap all right I'm bringing this Brio
Gio rose Arco like cream for my
hair just because it really does make a
difference when I'm blow-drying my hair
perfume I just have one of those little
travel oohs I have it filled with my
Chanel Mademoiselle I love that perfume
this is something that you can mix it's
the nooks wheel protégée I'm sure I'm
butchering this but it's just like kind
of glisteny oil you can mix with your
moisturizer and it can make your legs
look glowy and more tan so I figure
we're going to Barcelona I will totally
use that I thought about bringing like a
whole natural glow thing but that's even
smaller and more versatile so I'm
bringing nail polish I'm pretty sure
this is what I'm gonna pay my nails
tomorrow before we leave and so if it is
this is the one that will be in here I
don't usually bring a topcoat anymore I
used to but I figured you know if I need
to touch up I'll just touch up and move
on it'll look better than not and that
extra top coat takes up some space I
have some lip balm this is the glossy a
mint balm calm I love that stuff I have
a two primers this is the Too Faced
hangover RX I love it's very
moisturizing but then I'm also bringing
the two shalat blur primer from YSL
because this is much more blurring and
port filling and I figure it's so cute
and small and I already love it I'm
bringing you full size eye primer only
because I have the room 2 from Urban
Decay my favorite lip product this is
the infallible paints lips and spicy
blush this I've gotten away with not
putting at my liquids bag because it
technically you know you're not
squeezing it out at Tenga has a doe foot
but again it's kind of one of those
things that I'll just put it in here
just in case i have the room but if I
didn't I would just take it out and put
it my makeup bag these little eight
cosmetics CC creams I have light and
fair I usually mix these I love that
stuff so let me see if I can get these
little guys in here so I still have more
rooms so if I did decide oh I want to
put this in here or if they pull the
lipgloss out of my makeup bag and said
hey you got to put it in there I would
still have room to do that I love this
bag can you tell alright let's go
through my hanging organizer so right
here in the top I keep just random
things I've got some face masks in here
these are these five-minute pathology
masks they're so quick and hydrating I
love them this is like the second box of
these I've had so I totally love those
I have some eye patches as well this is
hair stuff I have like bobby pins and
stuff a little clip for doing my hair my
razor my nail file my toothbrush oh I
love these these are these elf brush
cleansing wipes and they're so good for
cleaning off your brushes before you
just throw them back in your makeup bag
this is nail polish remover pads these
are laundry soap sheets you literally
put one of these in the sink filled with
water and you wash your clothes in it
let them air dry isn't that the most
amazing thing we did this we've done it
on a cruise before and it was awesome it
totally worked go figure right so that's
what's in there and here you can pretty
much see but I'll show you feminine
products just in case this is my
favorite deodorant it's the Schmitz
natural deodorant this smells amazing
it's awesome this is the best thing I've
ever bought for travel if you've ever
stayed in a place that there's no good
lighting for doing your makeup and so
then you move near a window to have some
lighting but then you don't really have
a good mirror this is amazing if I can
find it I'll link it below but you just
set your mirror there and it's oh my
gosh it's good to go it's kind of
protected when you travel it's awesome
these are oh my gosh I love these so
much this is the milk matcha toner I
love just putting this all over my face
even when I'm flying but this won't be
like at hand actually maybe I will do
this to my other bag anyway and then
this is their hydrating oil super
hydrating coz your skin gets so dried
out so I love those I'm so excited that
those don't have to be in a clear in the
clear bag so that's what's in there
moving on I have my brushes I have my
Beauty Blender I'll probably before I
leave my friend told me that she'll put
like little silica gel packets in with
this in a ziploc bag when she travels
because then it soaks up all the
moisture and I thought oh my gosh so
I'll probably do that I have my contacts
case and then I just have all my brushes
I don't really want to go through every
one I kind of just spread out my brushes
and said okay let's go through me
getting ready what do I need a powder
brush a blush brush you know different
eye brushes but I've got my tweezers you
can bring little scissors when you carry
on they've never pulled those out which
is good so that's what
in there now let's talk about the makeup
so you already saw some of my makeup in
the clear bag I actually put my two like
little pallets I put them separate just
back behind it because it ends up being
cushion in my met bag pretty well now
this is what I wanted to show you guys
this is the what do they actually call
it where's the name this is the lay and
go cosmetics bag so all my makeup is in
there other than the liquids and what's
nice is once we land and we check into
the place we're staying the first night
I can spread out my makeup and get the
makeup out of here and put it in there
cuz there's plenty of room that way all
my makeups together so you just undo
that and you can spread it out and you
literally let me actually undo it all
the way you can literally just see all
your makeup isn't that's so nice
so for me if we're going from place to
place each night it's a really nice to
be able just lay this out get ready
because when I've got it all in a bag I
have to pull all of it out anyway
and then I'm just laying it on the floor
or the countertop so this is so much
quicker genius invention so the two
pallets I'm bringing this is the studio
makeup on the go and it's the one in
warm it up or warm up it's just perfect
it's got the perfect mattes a few
shimmers I mean I could have gotten away
with bringing only this but I love
makeup so I also pulled some single
shadows like I've got soft brown from
Mac just ran and once some more shimmery
ones I felt like they didn't have in
there so that's it though I was very
very good this trip this is very this is
a small amount of makeup in my opinion
so the blush I'm bringing is from the
balm it's the bomb beach blush it's just
beautiful it kind of goes with
everything I have to admit I have like
three blushes in here at first I was
like Jessica no one blush because the
odds are I will probably buy makeup on
more there cuz I'll just be so excited
and I want to have room this bronzer
numbering in the NARS Laguna bronzer I'm
bringing the pure afterglow highlight
which is so so gorgeous one of my
absolute favorites I'm also bringing
this for if I'm you know during the day
I might not want that strong of a
highlight this is the NYX dose of do
it's just kind of a dewy glossy one you
just kind of stick on your face I love
it
bringing this sugar lip scrub from
Milani it is amazing and a lifesaver
again when you're traveling everything
gets dried out and you don't think about
things like that you know all right so
I'm bringing those it cosmetics CC
creams I'm also if I want more coverage
bringing my hourglass vanish stick in
shell is the shade I'm wearing currently
I love this it's so high coverage so
when we're going out at night if I want
to look really good I can wear this
during the day I can wear those CC
creams and again it's not a liquid so I
don't have to put it in there for my
brows I'm just bringing the Anastasia
dip brow pomade but I'm also bringing
this Maybelline brow precise little
pencil just because if I can't get like
the tail of my brow well enough with
this I can go in with this really
quickly I'm bringing my Bobbi Brown
corrector to get rid of like dark
circles and then the only other
concealer I'm bringing is my YSL Touche
clot i-i've talked about this where I
don't think it's necessarily it's so
expensive for what it is and they have
drugstore equivalents but I feel like I
really do like this for when I'm in a
hurry I can tap it in with my fingers
which for travel is perfect and a lot of
times we're gonna be in the Sun and this
never really looks cakey or anything
which I really appreciate all right I'm
bringing this powder foundation just for
extra coverage the cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination and love it this
is the loose powder and bringing it's
from Givenchy and I've ended up really
growing to like this even though I
didn't like it at first especially for
the price point but I can also just use
what it's four different shades that you
mix together but I can use this shade if
I want to set my under eye as well and
brighten that so it's kind of a
multi-tool there I'm only bringing one
lipstick this is the Rouge Dior in
classic sorry
so Rouge Dior classic matte lipstick in
772 just a really pretty kind of pink
and I thought you know what I always
bring like three lipsticks and never
wear any of them I'm just gonna bring
one and that's what I'm gonna wear the
only lip liner I'm bringing is this kind
of clear kind of lip primer liner thing
from bite Beauty so I thought that was
perfect
again multi-use and then I'm bringing
this buxom lip cream in sandy it's just
really pretty everyday color I'm
bringing my makeup remover pen from ELF
I love it it's easy to clean up a winged
line for liner I bring three and
that's overkill but this is the pixie I
defined waterline that I really like
this is the NYX epic ink liner the best
drugstore liquid liner I've ever found
this is the l'oreal blackest black
lacquer liner i love and then my a
cosmetic superhero mascara that's it
aren't you guys proud of me i feel like
for me and for anyone that loves makeup
as much as i do I feel like that's
pretty darn good so when I do this and
this I probably don't need to do but I
just like to kind of organize it a
little bit so when I lay it out it's
like kind of organized and ready to go
this is the best and also they have the
little things for brushes and like this
little thing I never really used that I
guess I could what if I just put all of
these in there but I feel like it always
like gets it weird but I guess I could
do that right so maybe if I put those in
there these kind of along the side so
you can see that little lump though it
doesn't really solve that problem but
whatever nice that worked so I just put
those in there oh and I have a little
headband to hold my hair back so that is
everything in there and then you just
kind of roll it up and then you just tie
this to keep it together and that's
pretty much that it's pretty bulky but
it's so once you get it in like I've
fitted in my suitcase I know it fits but
it's just so convenient to have it
unrolled and just hanging up and then
like I said once I get there I usually
put all my skincare in here and all my
makeup in the thing with it that way
anytime if I'm just going to get a
shower I can just bring this bag and I
have it all ready to go and then all my
makeups together as well and then before
I fly home I make sure to reorganize it
again so if you enjoy this style of
