February favourites and this has been
such an awesome month for me I just
started student teaching again which I
was doing it it's kind of hard to
explain how our program works but this
is my second time student teaching and I
graduate in a few months and I cannot
wait but it's been just such a good
month I've gotten to get to know some
new kiddos in my life which is always
fun for me so but it's also been a
really good month for me just like I've
discovered a lot of new products at
least they're new to me that I have
completely fall in love with and I feel
like most of these are new to me there
are a few that I've had for a while that
I just rediscovered so it's it's full of
a lot of goodies so let's get started
okay so we'll start with one of the lip
products that I just recently
rediscovered and it's the Nivea lip
butter and it's the one that's in
raspberry rose a kiss and the way that
it works if I can get the problem is I
always struggle to get it open like if
you just put lotion on forget it but
this one has this beautiful raspberry
smell it kind of has a milky look to it
if you know what I mean and it kind of
looks that way when you first put it on
your lips but after a while it just
sinks in and it smells good it feels
amazing I don't typically wear this
during the day because really if you've
got any dryness on your lips the first
minute or even five minutes it looks so
weird and like it like highlights those
areas but after it's sunk in it's
beautiful so I'll either put it on like
maybe in the morning or I'll put it on
at night especially but I usually don't
put it on during the day just because of
that you know five-minute period where
it looks weird especially when I'm at
school
I don't know so but it smells amazing it
feels amazing and it's so inexpensive
and this is my favorite one of them so
that's one of my favorites some products
that are new to me are the Rimmel show
off lip lacquers and I have it in oh my
gosh so many shades I have it in
apocalyptic which is what I'm wearing
today and then I have novo which is this
light pink one and then what is this one
BIGBANG and I have another one but I
think it's in my purse I guess I could
swatch these for you I'll try and do it
in order I've got apocalyptic
here which like I said is on my lips I'm
going to put this darker one next to it
these are great because they're not a
lipstick they're not a lip gloss they're
like a glossy lipstick but they're all
crazy pigmented and they wear off in the
most beautiful way so this is
apocalyptic no no I don't have a clue
okay
apocalyptic BIGBANG and Nova I love them
and like I said I'm wearing apocalyptic
Wow I said that three times did you get
it everyone alright so this is something
I recently picked up and who is it amory
or I've talked about like a million
times now Allison Anderson loves the
smell market peach at Bath Body Works
and I've smelled it before but I've
never actually bought any of the cans or
anything but then I saw that they had
this hard-working hand in body cream and
it's in the market peach scent and oh my
gosh now I like the smell of peaches a
lot but this it's so juicy oh my gosh
it's so juicy does it say oh it does say
it's got shea butter cocoa butter
avocado butter jojoba oil coconut oil
almond oil safflower oil so all kinds of
goodies for your skin and while this is
a smaller size than like their triple
moisture body creams that I love it's
also more moisturizing than that so I
use this only for my hands like after
I've washed them or when I'm going to
bed or first thing not first thing in
the morning because I've got a shower
and then put on my makeup but before I
leave for the day I put this on to like
part of me I just want to throw this big
thing in my purse like I love it it's so
so nice so alright I have a feeling I'm
gonna be out of breath in this video a
lot I'm already feeling out of breath I
might as well mention my jewelry
favorite of the month while I'm thinking
about it this necklace I showed it
recently in a video it's from shop
lately I'll link it below I loved it so
much I think it was around 10 or 12
dollars and I just think it is so pretty
and they have a silver version I think
they have like a white version too I
think I just love it and the last I
checked they still sell it so I'll put
the link below if you're interested
it's so cute because you can shorten it
and can be a lot shorter you know like
with a button-up shirt or with just a
cute blouse or you can wear it longer
over something that has a higher neck I
just it goes with everything I love it
so much
alright so trying to like separate these
so I know what I've already talked about
here one thing that I I love and I kind
of forgot about it got kind of pushed
with all my brushes it's the Real
Techniques powder brush it's so so good
it's so fluffy and what I love about it
is with my Rimmel stay matte powder I
can just get some on the brush and I
don't have to buff it into the skin I
can just place it into the skin which is
what you're supposed to do anyway and
you're supposed to do it with I mean
really a brush isn't the best way to
apply something like that because it's
supposed to be kind of rolled into the
skin with like a puff but I don't have
time for all that so this is perfect cuz
it really it gets right on the top of it
and then just presses it into the skin
and it's big enough that really I mean I
can almost see my entire forehead with
one in one fell swoop I mean this brush
is humongous I love it they're really
really inexpensive when you're thinking
about the quality of the brushes and
this is my favorite one in the line
alright
I'm spraying this one it's probably
gonna like ruin the necklace oh my gosh
okay so this has been a perfume favorite
of mine for so long and I just recently
re-watched my makeup collection video I
think like from a million years ago I
mean like not my most recent one from
like six months ago but the one from
before that which was not a million
years ago anyway
and I remember mentioning this and it's
the Viva La Juicy perfume and this is
like the huge size the 3.4 but you can
find really good deals on this perfume
at Christmastime you can get it for like
10 dot this size but you can find insane
gift deals especially after Christmas
when everything's on sale for Viva La
Juicy this is my favorite scent ever it
smells so good and I forgot about how
good it was I hadn't used it in a while
and the packaging is the door will come
on but it just smells so good it's like
one of those smells that like I smell it
I'm like oh yes like I'm serious about
not even like smiling like I love this
smell I love it alright I am out of
breath and my throat hurts for no reason
other than
I'm just like talking a lot what else is
new okay so this one is gonna be harder
to find for you guys but I've got to
mention it because I've loved it for so
long and I I don't think I've mentioned
it yet because it's hard to find but I
have to tell you about it it's this
Charles of the Ritz I shadow and it's in
the shade sand dancing and I've used it
like crazy it's like this brownish taupe
color and it looks so boring it's
completely matte I just I just washed it
there it's completely matte has great
pigmentation I've used it like crazy I
got it on this website that if I can
remember the name I'll put it on the
screen I've got to find it but they had
like they have crazy deals on like
discontinued makeup or brands that
aren't even like around anymore and I
don't think Charles of the Ritz is
making makeup anymore in terms of the
Ritz by the way is of the Ritz Carlton
like that family or the same person or
something interesting I remember
learning about the history a couple
years ago anyway this color is the most
perfect crease color ever and when I
bought it I swatch it knows like oh my
gosh it makes me think of like I Love
Lucy when they were like in black and
white and how there was always like a
perfect they always had a perfect crease
now of course that's in black and white
who knows what color the shadow actually
was it could have been bright blue for
all we know very well could've been but
for some reason and always you know
black and white translated to be the
perfect crease color and this is what it
reminds me of and I know that this is
supposedly like old fashioned if you
will so I just love it and if you're
especially if you're fair like me and a
lot of bronzy colors kind of look weird
on me I feel like and a lot of warm
Browns look really I just don't like the
way they look with my skin tone this is
a really cool color but it's not super
dark either it's perfect I found it on
Amazon for like $7.99 when I search
right before I started making this video
so I'll try and link that I will link
that so that you can get it because it's
worth every penny it's worth every penny
I use this all the time and I never
mention it because I'm like figured you
and you'll find it but you could still
find it so and if you know anything
about Charles of the wrists let me know
down below because I am genuinely like
curious about it I'm assuming they're
not being made anymore
anyway do you see me like sinking I'm
sitting on my bed but I'm like slowly
like sinking down okay now moving on for
my nails which are a mess right now
because when I get stressed or when I
when it's dry out you guys know your
cuticles gonna mess and then I'll like
pick out them a little bit so this elf
nourishing cuticle pen I really do like
and for the longest time I had it and I
never use it cuz it's like 2 or 3
dollars it might even be a dollar but
it's just because when you do it it
almost feels like nothing's coming out
but then you look at you're like oh
there's definitely oil on there on your
cuticles but it really is nice and the
past few nights I've been doing it
before bed and like once throughout the
day during my lunch and it's just it
seems to actually be making a difference
and it's so inexpensive and I just
really like it and it doesn't make your
hands feel super greasy sorry I clearly
need to do it which is why I'm doing it
right now it doesn't make your hands
feel super greasy or anything like that
either which is nice because sometimes
if you put cuticle oils on and throw oil
and you almost can't do anything for a
while this is perfect alright
the benefit Porefessional this is just a
little trial size my friend Ally sent me
is amazing and I almost hate to say it
because you guys know I'm not making
money and I know you guys aren't either
and so I hate that it's so expensive but
it's really good and so if you can find
it in a kit get it because I've heard
that this will last a long time I've
been using it for a while now and it
doesn't feel like I've made a dent in it
so that's good I don't want to buy it I
know that much I mean it's like thirty
dollars of the whole size but I know
that I'm going to when I run out because
this is the best primer I've ever used
I reviewed the maybelline baby skin
primer and I liked that stuff so if you
get your hands on it I like it this is
better so much better so much better but
I have a question if this is like a kind
of a beige e tan color I don't want to
say it's a nude color because it's it's
not nude for certain skin tone so you
know what I mean it's right there if you
can see it so it's like a tan skin tone
for me what about for you darker darker
skin gals can you use this because I
feel it I feel like it might blend
into anyone's skin just fine because it
doesn't really leave a color if you know
what I mean but the fact that it is a
little bit colored makes me wonder how
it would appear if you've got really
dark skin tones so let me know if you
are darker how this looks on you if it
works for you because it just seems
weird that they wouldn't make one that's
darker unless this just completely
blends out which I think it might so not
sure but I love it all right so now on
to the lipstick that I'm wearing that I
love so much oh so much no did I say I'm
wearing it I'm not wearing it I usually
am wearing it I'm not wearing it today
don't let me fool you I already told you
what I'm wearing three times okay so
it's the best of a lipsticks I have
exotic pink and cherry red my video my
boxycharm video I think I mentioned that
I got the cherry red one which you guys
all we're really nice and complimentary
about because it was a really dark vampy
color for me but exotic pink is my
absolute favorite and I think I got this
in a wantable box if I'm correct and
then cherry red is one that I got with
referral points on Birchbox website so
there they are exotic pink and cherry
red these are the most luxurious
lipsticks I've ever owned now they're
like $22 a pop you can get them on
Birchbox if you get referral credits on
there they sell them there they came in
a watchable box that's how I got
introduced to them so other than that I
mean they're pricey but oh my gosh you
guys like they're amazing they look I
don't even know I've never had a
lipstick like this they just last all
day and as they wear off they don't look
weird they don't get dry they don't get
cracked then you just glide right on but
they're not to glide II where it feels
like you're getting out of the lines and
it looks crazy it I love them I just
love them
alright I'm hoping that I've got enough
space to film this video I talk so much
alright
the batiste dry shampoo I finally tried
and this is the one in the blush now
this does I have learned leave a white
cast but it smells nice and my hair felt
clean literally for the first time in my
life huh some lovin happened so fair
amid a girl crazy there phone
man-boy queues can be summoned a it's
drifted way oh oh the summer nights Oh
weather weather weather tell me tell me
you ever sing a song and you try and
sing every single part like there might
be like ten people in the song singing
and you're like going huh like juicing
all the man and all the women markets
well that was random anyway okay
batiste dry shampoo I got it in the
blush scent I was gonna say shade but no
no scent smells really nice you guys
literally I use this the other day now
it has a white cast which was I could I
figured it might so it's kind of a
bummer but I used it let it sit in my
hair while I finish my makeup then
brushed it through and then kind of
restyled my hair with my curling wand
you know just a little bit and halfway
through the day I looked in the mirror
and I was just kind of thinking and I
was like oh yeah I washed my hair today
and then I literally an hour later
thought I was like no it didn't look my
hair feels and looks so fresh that I
literally forgot that I hadn't washed my
hair that day that it was second day
hair I've never in my life and that was
I literally just kind of smile at myself
I was like oh my gosh I love this dry
shampoo I can't believe that happened
so I'm very excited and I am going to be
doing a giveaway soon and this will be
included in it cuz I just got a good
deal on some so and I love you guys so I
think once I hit 20,000 subscribers I'm
gonna do a giveaway and this will be
included I mean there'll be other stuff
too there but this is gonna be included
because I have fall in love with it
alright so another favorite is this haha
this Sigma I don't even know what they
call it it's one of their eyeshadow
bases and it's in persuade now Sigma
sent me this when I became an affiliate
just so I could try out some more their
stuff because I really didn't own that
much I want some brushes that I loved up
and still do so this was one of the ones
they sent me to try out and if you saw
the video where I was kind of showing
you some of the things they sent I was
not very sure about really any of it but
especially this uh boy was I wrong I
use this all the flippin time that's it
so it is a little dark for my skintone
but I've been using it today like all I
did was I put this all over and I
actually have like a kind of like a cut
there like um it's hard to explain but I
basically have a cut right there and
this covers it up so perfectly and I
have veining right there covers it up
perfectly and it's it's a different
consistency than any of the like cream
shadows I've used it's a different
consistency than any of the primers I've
used it's just kind of its own thing and
I freaking love it so I'll link it below
if you're interested I love it and I it
like I said it's the shade persuade
which is just a completely matte color
they have I think they have shimmery
colors to which I want to get some more
because I really do like it and it
doesn't move all day it does not move
and I was so impressed I was honestly so
impressed
so anyway speaking of cream shadows this
benefit creases crease shadow Chris this
crease crease you did crease crease and
don't have in the shade RSVP and it's
just a small size but I'm gonna have to
buy the full one because I love it there
it is right there can you see it look at
that beautiful it reminds me of if you
could have steelo's kit and eye shadow
and cream form that would be it it's the
most beautiful eyes I'll show it to you
in the pot - it's so pretty in it oh my
gosh I love it all I've been wearing all
week is that Sigma persuade thing all
over and then I've just been wearing the
RSVP one just on the lid and it's just
been so like nice and fresh and glowy it
doesn't move all day it does not move at
all eat these this combination is like
frickin flawless and it's just so easy
I'm just like one little look I don't
know no brushes needed and then I can
just throw some liner mascara on and go
which is exactly what I've been doing so
well this video is getting long alright
another favorite and I mention are used
to talk about this all the time the elf
HD powder in corrective yellow now this
thing is so huge and I don't use it all
over my face I use it in my under eye to
set my under eye duh so it's kind of
this yellowish color and it's in here
but what I did is I bought these little
like travel-size containers from
virtually anywhere I got mine at Meijer
and I just put
some of it in there so it's just in
there and that way I can use this when
I'm getting ready and not have to pull
this out and shake some out you know
just make some mess so first of all that
means I'm literally never gonna run out
of this I would say this comparable I've
never tried it but it would have to be
comparable to the Ben Nye banana powder
because it will finally mildew built the
same shade but I use it not only sets
that area so it doesn't settle in
decreases but it brightens it because
it's this yellowish color it really is
nice and I've been using it a lot and I
forgot much I loved it
so another thing that I've been loving
is this pixie bronzer now if you're a
darker skin this is not gonna work for
you at all but it really does work for
me it's in the shade suddenly Sun
touched and I got this I think in an
Ipsy or a birch box I don't have a
freaking clue where I got it but it's
this I in person it looks more cool than
it's coming across it really is a cool
tone one but again it's really light so
if you are not as fair as I am it might
not show up as well but I'm gonna show
you a swatch of it there it is it is the
most beautiful contour I contoured with
it today my blush is looking a little
cray-cray sorry guys and then I also
kind of bronze my face up but what I
like about is is not super obvious and
in person I don't want it to look super
avi I mean you don't want it to look
super obvious ever probably but it's
just a really nice way to warm up my
skin tone because I am so pale and it
just makes me look a little bit more
alive last thing I'll mention is this
L'Oreal boost it hairspray a lot of you
guys were asking me how I liked it I
mean this is like a good month for hair
care for me really this stuff is crazy
strong so beware know that now it's
marketed to be good for your roots but
I've even used it all over my hair if my
hair is just like extra frizzy that day
or if it's like really humid or hasn't
really been human here at all but it
does have a more concentrated nozzle so
when it sprays its it is concentrated so
if you don't want it to be why did I do
that twice but it doesn't smell
I literally ate it kind of tasted like
grapes that's bizarre
and it it literally tastes sweet guys
it's I've never eaten so much hairspray
in my life I actually am can taste it on
my taste buds Oh anyway really really
cheap it's like three or four dollars
you can aim it right at the roots you
know if you tease I think I mentioned
that before but you could even use it
all over your hair but you'd really have
to be careful to hold a far-away because
it but it really holds oh my gosh you
guys I didn't use it today if I had my
hair would be even more voluminous but I
really do like it it smells nice it's
cheap and it's frankly if you're really
looking for something to hold your hair
at the roots this is it if you're not
wanting to spend a lot of money
especially I love this stuff
I'm sure I'll rebuy it once it's gone
because it's it's really really nice so
oh I have to mention one more favorite
of mine and it's a bag that I recently
got and I'm so so in love with and it's
from the brand I don't know like oh I
don't know oh my gosh is this not
adorable and I love things that have
like a zipper on the side so I can just
put my phone in it and zip it up and
have it held against me you know but
it's so adorable now look at the inside
oh my gosh let me make it look
presentable about kidding its striped
brown and tan striped and there's like
some organizers in there and stuff oh my
gosh I literally saw this it was like
yep and I had just bought a purse from
Target and so literally like I'd worn
that purse from Target like once and I
saw the tag and then I found this and I
was like I'm buying this and returning
the other and that's exactly what I did
because it's so cute I oh my gosh and
how perfect for we're going right into
spring which I can't wait so I was just
so excited about that I will write the
name of what this purse the brand of it
is somewhere around me because I don't
know if you can find online
I got it at t.j.maxx so I'm not really
sure how available it is you know those
things are okay so I've never mentioned
a favorite TV show but my favorite TV
show right now is Downton Abbey and my
boyfriend and I make games out of every
and so we've made you know like drinking
games well we always drink you guys
gonna make fun of me we always drink tea
while we watch it always and we always
have like hot water with us like up in
my room here while we're watching it and
we've literally have like on our phones
typed up I'm Joe I just love this so
much like it's so good okay so one of
the rules anytime someone is caught
eavesdropping or just eavesdropping at
all
you drink it a sip of tea anytime
someone mentions duneagle
you drink a sip of tea anytime there's
some British nonsense like awesome
saying that Americans have never heard
you drink a sip of tea anytime that I
don't want to give anything away anytime
that the actress that plays Korra says a
word in a weird way because sometimes
our accent is real very bizarre you
drink a thing of tea anytime there's
like a random maid in the shop that
you've never seen before and they never
mentioned you drink a sip of tea anytime
anytime someone comes into the room in
the entire table has to stand up I and
one of them oh we wrote for one of them
you have to finish your whole cup of tea
if Lady Grantham drops the mic and what
I mean by that is like she says
something so ridiculously awesome and
mean that she should just like drop the
mic and walk away like you know what I
mean I hope you guys some of you guys
watch the show because if you know I
hope you clicked away by now cuz I'm
sure none of this makes any sense
but make little games out of your
favorite TV shows cuz we have been
having so much fun doing that of course
we're just drinking tea it's not like
anything crazy but it's just so much
more fun and enjoyable as if that show
is not absolutely amazing as it is but
so be it anyway so don't give anything
away by the way if you're watching this
and you have caught up on Downton Abbey
because we're still catching up on this
most recent season so but anyway I hope
that was enjoyable for you guys wow this
is a long video I am so so sorry but I
don't approve this fun for you guys to
watch let me know what your favorite um
anything was in February because I
always love getting ideas from you guys
of new things to try
old favorites of yours that you think I
should try if I have it and yeah so I'll
catch up with you guys down there and
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
