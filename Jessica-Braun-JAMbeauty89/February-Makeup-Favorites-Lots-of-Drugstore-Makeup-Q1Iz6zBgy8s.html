bringing you my februari favorites and
I've got some makeup favorite some fresh
favorites some skincare favorites and
ask our favorite we'll start with that
this i got from shop lately you guys and
it's one of the you know it's an
infinity scarf and it's obviously plaid
but it's the right size i have been
having the hardest time finding a scarf
that would that's not too long that you
know when you wrap it around twice
around your head and that it's like
hanging really weird this one is perfect
and it's warm and it wasn't that
expensive i can't remember how much it
was off the top of my head but if i can
find the link to this scarf ate a few
other colors i'll link it below you guys
I love shop lately so much um that's
where I get most of my jewelry because
everything's like can be five dollars
Tendo I mean it's all pretty inexpensive
it's just the best anyway okay so
another favorite of mine is my naked 2
palette you guys I rediscovered this
because I've been decluttering and I
just put up my palette declutter and as
I was editing that because I film those
a while ago as I was editing it was
looking at my naked to pout and I'm like
oh my gosh like I used to love that
palette so I pulled it back out and I've
been using it and I use it for my eye
look today and so all my lids is a
actually an elf smudge pot in back to
basis which is another favorite of mine
I'll get to that in a second so that's
all that's on my lid but then in my
crease I used teas here which is like a
matte mid-tone very cool brownish color
and then i use suspect on top of that in
my crease as well which I'm that's one
of my favorites in this it's like a
cool-toned cool toned like gold kind of
but with taupe to it's really cool and
then I used ydk kind of in the outer
crease which is this really cool shade
and then what else did I use oh I used
busted which is this deeper color on my
lower lash line and then I used foxy
which is this matt light yellow just to
blend it all together I love this
palette and I actually didn't use a
primer today I usually do but somehow I
just skipped it and it still worked so
well these shadows are so amazing you
don't even need a primer like if you're
wanting to travel with the palette you
don't want to pack an extra primer bring
an urban decay one because they are
amazing so love this forgot how amazing
amazing it is I think I do like
this better than the naked one I don't
have the naked 3 but naked one versus
this I think I like this one better
because I like cooler tones better
anyway ok another favorite mind is you
guys the elf skincare I have filmed a
review and a demo of the skincare and it
is amazing and you guys know I'm not
sponsored by them they're not paying me
to say anything they send it to me and I
decided to review it and it's amazing it
is so amazing oh my gosh so I'll show
you what it looks like but i'll link the
video where i go through all these and
show you how i use them but there's like
the daily moisturizer there's the serum
and a pump i love the ones that have
pumps and then they have their
illuminating eye cream and the night
cream as well and you can get this whole
set for $42 which seems pricey for elf
but it's for really amazing products so
it works out to eight to twelve dollars
for each of these or you can buy them
separately they're amazing I'll leave
the video below oh my gosh so but
speaking of skincare I broke out before
I got this stuff I was trying a new
serum and I don't even member the brand
I threw it away so fast um but I was
trying it out and it broke me out here
and it gave me a huge pimple here so I
have been needing to cover it have been
wanting to cover and I've been using my
hard candy glama flage and I forgot how
amazing this product is at covering
blemishes I don't really use it under my
eye very much because it's really heavy
duty and I don't need that much coverage
but it is amazing I have filmed a demo
of how I covered this today it's
obviously not perfect you can still see
I have a blemish there but it's so much
better than it was let me know if you'd
be interested in actually seeing that
video I haven't decided if I'm actually
gonna put it up or not because again
it's not perfect but it's what i do to
cover blemishes and i think it worked up
pretty well so i have it in the shade
light it's like six to eight dollars
it's only sold at walmart hard candy is
so i love this I've heard some people
use it to cover tattoos I don't know if
that actually works I don't have any
tattoos to cover but I think it's
amazing for how inexpensive it is so the
other favorite that I'd mentioned was
this elf smudge pot it's in back to
basics and it's just this really pretty
a kind of brownish gold color and I used
it all over my lid today and you don't
need anything with these you don't need
a primer underneath you don't need
shadow on top they go on so flawlessly
and i'll insert me applying this right
now it just it's kind of more of a
moosie texture than most cream shadows
are it's very different than like the
Mac Paint Pots in the color tattoos this
is a very mu C kind of softer cream
shadow but I find that that makes it
blend so much better and it's so
flawless and these do not budge at all
and this shade is just it's become one
of my favorites I love it and these I
think are like two or three dollars on
their website amazing I am realizing now
how many of these are elf products well
that's not about things they're cheap so
i've also been trying out the elf
intense ink eyeliner and i love it it's
how it's what i use today and it's got
this huge brush and I don't give it it's
a it's like a sponge or a felt tip you
guys know what I mean and it does such
an amazing job of getting in there and
you can really use it to or flick out
your wing however it and then fill it in
it is so amazing it is very very black
well it can get crazy thick or you can
get crazy thin I mean it is amazing and
again I think this is like three dollars
on their website you really can't beat
it and it's really really good i was so
excited at how good this was because
sometimes those thicker ones i'm not a
big fan of but because this tapered off
to such a nice point i found that it's
actually been really really nice to use
and easy to use to another favorite of
mine the foundation i'm wearing today is
my L'Oreal infallible I had purchased
this in 103 and I did a demo and
tutorial which most of you have seen and
it was way too dark and so I did end up
returning that one and getting the next
shade down which is 102 well it's
actually I'm wearing today and I know it
looks fine on camera but it's still a
little bit too dark so i i'm not going
to return this i'm just going to keep it
cuz i'll use it in the summer but i'm
still thinking about going back and
getting 101 so that way i can use it in
the winter like right now because this
is so beautiful i love this foundation
so much it looks that
I finally discovered i do like this the
best with the Beautyblender it works
well with your hands that works fine
with the brush but it is flawless with
the Beauty Blender or some sort of wet
sponge I love it another product that
i've been loving i'm wearing on my lips
today it's one of the Milani matte
lipsticks and it's in matte blissful and
this is just a really pretty light pink
color kind of rosy pink and it's just
the perfect matte formula it doesn't
leave your lips feeling dry but it goes
on so matt and it's just so inexpensive
and it's such an amazing matte lipstick
I want to go get more and what I love is
that these don't have the same smell as
the original Milani lipsticks do that I
really don't like this one doesn't have
that smell at all thank you so I'm very
happy about that and the last thing I'm
gonna talk about another elf product I'm
sorry you guys I just been recently
trying a lot of elk products that
they've set and they're good I can't I'm
not gonna lie to you guys they're just
good so this is their ultimate kabuki
brush again I did a demo on my channel
of how to use this and you know kind of
the pros and cons of it it's a very
large brush it's really soft and
beautiful but you use it to I use it to
kind of bronze up my face and dude like
a kind of sloppy contour and by sloppy I
mean just like a light dusting of a
contour powder not a sharp you know what
I mean it's amazing this is ten dollars
but it's worth every penny if you I mean
just to bronze up your face it's so so
so so beautiful so I love it I used it
every single day since I did that video
every single day I just it does better
than any brush I've ever used frankly
and that I own so the last favorite I'm
actually working on a review for right
now and it's the Too Faced better than
sex mascara this I'd gotten in a kit
with like the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette which is awesome too and a few
other to face products but I'd never on
the full-size this is amazing i used it
on my lashes today and there's so much
more curled and voluminous in black and
the brush is kind of crazy like it looks
like almost intimidating it's just this
really really wet
ki brush but it does such a nice job of
here I can just apply some more it does
such a nice job of really kind of
separating your lashes but not too much
because i don't like that perfect look I
kind of like that thicker blackened look
I don't really know how to describe that
but it is amazing and the packaging is
beautiful it's expensive though so if
you can find it in a kit or at least
maybe try out a trial size although the
trial size I tried out I really liked it
but it wasn't quite the same as this at
least the one I got so this is even
better I love it so much so hopefully
this video was helpful for you i will
link any of the reviews that I have up
of these products below if you want to
see them more in depth and learn more
about where you can get them etc so if
you enjoyed please subscribe and I will
catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
