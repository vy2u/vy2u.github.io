bringing you my February favorites and
I've got some makeup favorites some
brush favorites some skincare favorites
and a scarf favorite will start with
that this I got from shop lately you
guys and it's one of the you know it's
an infinity scarf and it's obviously
plaid but it's the right size but I have
been having the hardest time finding a
scarf that would that's not too long
that you know when you wrap it around
twice around your head and then it's
like hanging really weird this one is
perfect and it's warm and it wasn't that
expensive I can't remember how much it
was off the top of my head but if I can
find the link to this scarf aid a few
other colors I'll link it below you guys
I love shopping so much that's where I
get most of my jewelry because
everything's like can be $5 $10 it's all
pretty inexpensive it's just the best
anyway okay so another favorite of mine
is my naked 2 palette you guys I
rediscovered this because I've been
decluttering and I just put up my
palette declutter and as I was editing
that because I film those a while ago as
I was editing it I was looking at my
naked 2 pout and I'm like oh my gosh
like I used to love that palette so I
pulled it back out and I've been using
it and I use it for my eye look today
and so all my lids is a actually an elf
smudge pot in back to basis which is
another favorite of mine I'll get to
that in a second so that's all that's on
my lid but then in my crease I used T's
here which is like a matte mid-tone very
cool
brownish color and then I use suspect on
top of that in my crease as well which
I'm that's one of my favorites in this
it's like a cool toned cool toned like
gold kind of but with taupe too it's
really cool and then I used ydk kind of
in the outer crease which is this really
cool shade and then what else did I use
oh I used busted which is this deeper
color on my lower lashline and then I
used foxy which is this matte light
yellow just to blend it all together I
love this palette and I actually didn't
use a primer today I usually do but
somehow I just skipped it and it still
worked so well these shadows are so
amazing you don't even need a primer
like if you're wanting to travel with
the pallet and you don't want to pack an
extra primer bring an urban decay one
because they are amazing so love this
forgot how amazing amazing it is I think
I do like this better than the naked one
I don't have the naked 3 but naked 1
versus this I think I like this one
better because I like cooler tones
better anyway ok another favorite of
mine is you guys
the elf skin care I have filmed a review
and a demo of this skin care and it is
amazing and you guys know I'm not
sponsored by them they're not paying me
to say anything they send it to me and I
decided to review it and it's amazing it
is so amazing oh my gosh so I'll show
you what it looks like but I'll link the
video where I go through all these and
show you how I use them but there's like
the daily moisturizer
there's the serum and a pump I love the
ones that have pumps and then they have
their illuminating eye cream and the
night cream as well and you can get this
whole set for $42 which seems pricey for
elf but it's for really amazing products
so it works out to eight to twelve
dollars for each of these or you can buy
them separately
they're amazing I'll leave the video
below oh my gosh so but speaking of
skincare I broke out before I got this
stuff I was trying a new serum and I
don't even member the brand I threw it
away so fast but I was trying it out and
it broke me out here and it gave me a
huge pimple here so I have been needing
to cover it have been wanting to cover
it and I've been using my hard candy
glamoflauge and I forgot how amazing
this product is at covering blemishes I
don't really use it under my eye very
much because it's really heavy duty and
I don't need that much coverage but it
is amazing I have filmed a demo of how I
covered this today
it's obviously not perfect you can still
see I have a blemish there but it's so
much better than it was let me know if
you'd be interested in actually seeing
that video I haven't decided if I'm
actually gonna put it up or not because
again it's not perfect but it's what I
do to cover blemishes and I think it
worked up pretty well so I have it in
the shade light it's like six to eight
dollars it's only sold at Walmart hard
candy is so I love this I've heard some
people use it to cover tattoos I don't
know if that actually works I don't have
any tattoos to cover but I think it's
amazing for how inexpensive it is so the
other favorite that I'd mentioned was
this elf smudge pot it's in
back-to-basics and it's just this really
pretty kind of
brownish gold color and I used it all
over my lid today and you don't need
anything with these you don't need a
primer underneath you don't need shadow
on top they go on so flawlessly and I'll
insert me applying this right now it
just it's kind of more of a moosie
texture than most cream shadows are it's
very different than like the Mac Paint
Pots in the color test use this is a
very moosie kind of softer cream shadow
but I find that that makes it blend so
much better and it's so flawless and
these do not budge at all
and this shade is just it's become one
of my favorites I love it and these I
think are like 2 or 3 dollars on their
website amazing I am realizing now how
many of these are elf products well
that's not a bad thing as they're cheap
so I've also been trying out the elf
intense ink eyeliner and I love it it's
how well it's what I use today and it's
got this huge brush and I don't even
it's a it's like a sponge or a felt tip
you guys know what I mean
and it does such an amazing job of
getting in there and you can really use
it touch or flick out your wing however
and then fill it in it is so amazing it
is very very black well it can get crazy
thick or you can get crazy thin I mean
it is amazing and again I think this is
like $3 on their website you really
can't beat it and it's really really
good I was so excited at how good this
was because sometimes those thicker ones
I'm not a big fan of but because this
tapered off to such a nice point I found
that it's actually been really really
nice to use and easy to use - another
favorite of mine the foundation I'm
wearing today is my L'Oreal infallible I
had purchased this in 103 and I did a
demo tutorial which most of you have
seen and it was way too dark and so I
did end up returning that one and
getting the next shade down which is 102
well it's actually I'm wearing today and
I know it looks fine on camera but it's
still a little bit too dark so I'm not
going to return this I'm just gonna keep
it because I'll use it in this summer
but I'm still thinking about going back
and getting 101 so that way I can use it
in the winter like right now because
this is so beautiful I love this
nation so much it looks the best I
finally discovered I do like this the
best with the Beautyblender it works
well with your hands that works fine
with the brush but it is flawless with
the beauty blender or some sort of wet
sponge I love it another product that
I've been loving I'm wearing on my lips
today it's one of the Milani matte
lipsticks and it's in matte blissful and
this is just a really pretty light pink
color kind of rosy pink and it's just
the perfect matte formula it doesn't
leave your lips feeling dry but it goes
on so matte and it's just so inexpensive
and it's such an amazing matte lipstick
I want to go get more and what I love is
that these don't have the same smell as
the original Milani lip sticks to that I
really don't like this one doesn't have
that smell at all thank you so I'm very
happy about that and the last thing I'm
gonna talk about another elf product I'm
sorry you guys I've just been recently
trying a lot of elf products that
they've set and they're good I can't I'm
not gonna lie to you guys they're just
good so this is their ultimate kabuki
brush again I did a demo on my channel
of how to use this and you know kind of
the pros and cons of it it's a very
large brush it's really soft and
beautiful but you use it too I use it to
kind of bronze up my face and do like a
kind of sloppy contour and my sloppy I
mean just like a light dusting of a
contour powder not a sharp you know what
I mean it's amazing this is ten dollars
but it's worth every penny if you I mean
just to bronze up your face it's so so
so so beautiful so I love it I used it
every single day since I did that video
every single day I just it does better
than any brush I've ever used frankly
and that I own so the last favorite I'm
actually working on a review for right
now and it's the Too Faced better than
sex mascara this I've gotten in a kit
with like the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette which is awesome too
and a few other Too Faced products but
I've never owned the full size this is
amazing I used it on my lashes today and
there's so much more curled and
voluminous in black and the brush is
kind of crazy like it looks like almost
intimidating it's just this really
really wet
a key brush but it does such a nice job
of here I can just apply some more it
does such a nice job of really kind of
separating your lashes but not too much
because I don't like that perfect look I
kind of like that thicker blackened look
I don't really know how to subscribe
that but it is amazing and the packaging
is beautiful it's expensive though so if
you can find it in a kit or at least
maybe try out a trial size although the
trial size I tried out I really liked it
but it wasn't quite the same as this at
least the one I got so this is even
better I love it so much so hopefully
this video was helpful for you I will
link any of the reviews that I have up
of these products below if you want to
see them more in-depth and learn more
about where you can get them etc so if
you enjoyed please subscribe and I will
catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
