come on nervy oh you've also had a
margarita or two cameras on I'm nervous
I'm like oh you're so amazing and
there's Pinocchio's taking it by trash
see I know how neither into Nurmi we're
just not theirs we never used to there's
like anything for watching there's
probably three people want to be 14 and
Pinocchio's here he's really was making
me nervous yes of course
between reality and you never know it
was worth a uphill climb but there's a
find we stopped no I'm sorry no I did
there's a fine line
between you wonderful
such a crime
we start
fine
between together
and no waste of time
alright let's go rock okay so I mean I
don't
oh don't worry yourself announce Kelly
you got to learn well maybe you'll burn
yourself and learn I made it I don't
even know like it's like I'm coming
okay so Blanco chicken I don't know it
was a whole bunch of fresh ingredients
that I was really excited to try with
tortillas and chicken so we were excited
to try it and he doesn't know that an
oven is hot yet so let's learn him very
hot we are you oven near you
is it hot we're trying to watch The
Great Gatsby right it might be yeah it
might be on HBO let's see yeah I told
him it's one of those weird movie
because we both read the book like more
than once and it's the book is amazing
but he's like I don't love it I did I
don't know why it was like my first
entrance to disillusionment so for me it
was like life-changing but he hasn't
seen the movie and I've seen it like 15
movies oh yeah there's a lot and I
remember watching one in high school but
this movie is like way better than I
don't know it's different I guess that's
what it is and the first time I saw it I
was like yeah and then the second time I
saw I was like oh and then that's all
I've see I've always needed twice but I
think about it all the time it's the
weirdest thing so something about the
way they didn't really resonate with me
yeah it's like the 1920s of course but
it's also like the 2000s it's a very
weird juxtaposition I love it also this
is our life right now which would be his
toys everywhere I'm like if this is
anything but whoa my bun is so I it is
anything what having a kid is like I
don't know but it's so dirty all because
of that anyway do you guys like my shirt
Tyler when did you get this for me
Christmas Merry Christmas you filthy
animal
I what's the one way yeah never makes
their own stuff let's see let's see yes
everywhere and somebody was like oh I
make them myself
oh thank you on and they did we saw oh
my gosh a Mickey Mouse short that what
was they called the I sent it to my
brother too because I knew he would
laugh the aah
we'll figure it out if we can figure it
out something will listed below but
literally the guy that saw Minnie and
Mickey Robbin a picnic and he drove it
this is from the 30 in the 1930s and
literally he's just right there good
anyway so the guy I need to like pull
the camera away he literally went wow
that's Minnie Mouse my old squeeze and
then he was like like bobbing it was me
I don't know how to describe it I'll
link it below if I can find it because I
know we watch it on YouTube dimly it was
the funniest thing I've ever seen I'm
like this is fantastic because we always
joke about like vaudevillian actors now
they have this very specific boys and I
don't know subscribe it yes
so we Instagram the other day or I guess
I did he texted me yeah bad news he can
now jump on this couch will not jump
like climb scratching and clawing to get
up on this couch because most of our
meals on this I know it's it's terrible
but we do eat most of our meals on this
couch I know it's bad I have a dining
room table but it's not yeah well
actually we're getting I can't I don't
know if you guys can see it that's like
an old school one we have one coming in
the mail
90% oh maybe we'll eat there when we get
the new one I bet it'll be couple times
but we mostly do because we watch TV
while we eat because you know we're
Americans oh my gosh don't make it like
any worse anyway what's the point
oh now he climbs up so like you know
dinner up here and he's right on top of
us right thinker he's so cute oh okay so
right now I mean I know
we're like testing this out because
we've never daily vlog we've never
whatever I don't know so we're kind of
trying this out so we're doing it just
with YouTube capture because we figure
right now we're just doing it kind of
just for funsies yeah like lackadaisical
just like chill ride a night we've had
two margaritas why not that's true
longest week ever at work like it's
forever and it was Labor Day this is the
four-day week those are the worst and -
will be a full moon week which I'm
pretty sure last week was a Pullman well
I teach the moon phases so we talk about
all the time anyway it's been a long
week so yes anyway I guess that's it we
can shut up now but I'm excited to see
how this turns out let me know if you
guys like these kinds of videos I know
we've talked about doing these kinds of
videos on his channel
we might maybe we'll do like half and
half or maybe we'll create a whole new
channel I don't know let us know what
you guys think below because we've never
done it it's new to us but it is fun I
mean we're chilling and being silly
