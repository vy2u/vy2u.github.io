what is this map app that you hold on
it's Jessica and Sarah this is my BFF
since forever not really but it feels
like oh my gosh we were in Chicago right
now she lives in Chicago but we're going
we're kind of north of the city right
yeah and we're going to an outlet mall
right now that she says oh okay I am
really excited also it is 1 p.m. and I'm
just not getting coffee and when I tried
to order a flat white did you hear this
but I tried to order a flat white the
lady was like I said now you know I
can't even say it
Shh okay anyway I don't know I tried to
order a flat white and I said can I have
a grande white flat and she was like she
was really nice and she was like do you
know why I was like yes I need coming
anyway got it thanks lady
so what is the app that you're using
she's got like a maps directions app but
it's awesome it's ways waz e and what it
what's different about it I would alert
you all the speed cameras okay like
where cops are and stuff my dad used to
know know like if he was supposed to be
he used to have like one of those little
like scanners in his car like this was
like 20 years ago
and it would like beep if there was like
a cop in the area so you know it Alexa I
told you if the cops are hidden like
ahead or if they're like that is pretty
crazy so you know we're slow down
yes absolutely so yeah choppy
about the virus this is Emily
so I couldn't walk out a bath and
Bodyworks in the bottom bottom Oh fall
autumn season without buying so I bought
some plugins I'm waiting for the candles
be on sale because they're ridiculously
price when they're not on sale no way
he's very loved about leaves
so we are in the most magical places
Sara's really excited
tis nice tour but it's an outlet I
wonder if they have mugs I just need
more Disney like that's always when I'm
on the hunt for it's a great idea
I'll go as elf like every other
eight-year-old and or hook we found them
on and they are so cute look at the
Donald one I didn't notice that they
have like Jack Skellington 22
appropriate for Halloween have you seen
Nightmare Before Christmas listen oh
that could be is it's just like Mickey
pants we have one like that that's
really cute so we just got out of
forever 21 over there and we both got
sarah has like only fitness clothes so
she's a little gout for normal people
clothes and I'm on the lookout for
nonsense I'm actually looking I found a
cute dress that I think I'm gonna wear
go to New York in a few days and I'm
really excited so I think I'm over there
well we're hungry and so we got some
Wetzel's pretzels and I got like pizza
bites and they're crazy good and you got
like cinnamon ones they're good
now this gonna be intense we've decided
though also we got a giant thing of
lemonade to share and it's all over me
and it looks like I peed my pants and
I'm wearing white shorts
it's all good it's all gravy so we are
back at her apartment trying to get the
perfect selfie never gonna happen
against this window this person problem
there so we are headed to a Mexican
restaurant called antique taco yes out
it's called we are excited and we parked
like in a back alley and it's kind of
cool like looking at the building some
of them have like all kinds of plants
and stuff we should have more plants in
our own apartment 301 - 321 301 let's go
back we're trying to pay to park
how can you see that from here we're
trying to pay to park with an app also
the El train is like right next to us
I am excited for Mexican I just want to
walk slowly and I know you welcome oh
it's like your favorite - so we're here
and the walk and chips is like hi we
might need order a second like round the
clock
two thing the tacos I got each one order
with one taco you're still killing the
Baca Molina why not maybe so I have
remarked that there are an abnormal
amount of Burger Kings and we just
rounded a corner from an alley and boom
there's a Burger King
why are there so many Burger Kings we
are taking Pinocchio on a walk and he's
loving he's trippin Serra and sarra what
did you say about your shoes yeah she
was concerned they're white and he can't
step on them or poop on them he puts
importantly but this walk has been so
peaceful it's like a full moon tonight
and it is just like quiet and it smells
like someone it has a bonfire going so
it just smells like ball it totally
smells like fall oh my gosh I love it so
much Sara I might move in we need to
tell Tyler it was still in Disney okay
dokay you're all caught up so weird
maybe we're on a walk and we're just
walking and it's already kind of creepy
cuz it's getting dark and we're about to
head back but this person we just
glanced and Sara was like what they're
just a ton of dolls and the window
facing out and then there's one little
window there with the clown I my heart
stopped that was terrifying Sara I wish
you wouldn't have noticed it oh my gosh
my heart's still pounding we need to get
home
Coffee and him ready and raring to go
that would be my dog under there him
he's been sleeping for like this entire
trip because he's so tired he face
covered so hmm Pinocchio he's just like
running around in circles in here I
think he's excited to be out of the car
as am i it's funny because a three-hour
drive with traffic is like
three-and-a-half hours but it feels like
a lifetime especially when you're coming
home I feel like when you're going
somewhere and you're driving it the time
goes by faster because you're excited to
get there but driving home you know what
to expect when you get home so you're
just like oh it takes forever but I am
off to do some laundry you can see we've
already decorated for fall
we even see we even put like little
window Klingons on our window there
we're total nerds but the best part is
it's not just me Tyler is all in for
fall even though it's still 80 degrees
here so I know a lot of you guys were
asking what I got when we went to the
outlet mall so I figured I would show
you before kind of signing off here so
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works they had these
for five dollars these plugins Pinocchio
they're so cute so I got two I got my
favorite scent which is called leaves
but then this one is new to me
berry pumpkin strudel it smells amazing
so I got two of each and then I already
have more of these plugins but that's
all I got because these were on sale for
like three bucks and then this was on
sale for five from Lululemon I got this
zip up but I love it because it's fitted
but then at the very back it has this
cute little like ruffled part and I just
thought that was so cute I also got
these yoga capris from Lululemon and I
loved this top because I thought it was
just kind of neutral so I could travel
in them and not feel like I'm wearing
bright colors on an airplane I don't
know and then I also got this black
running top it was really on sale there
and then I got this purple running top
and then this I got at the j.crew outlet
and it's just such a pretty just fly
open sweater and it's like thick but
it's soft it was perfect and I thought
you know what I will literally wear the
so much in the fall in winter then from
forever21 I just got this like cutoff
turtleneck and I also got a dress which
I was wearing yesterday when we went out
for tacos so it's in the laundry right
now and then from the Nike outlet I just
got this running running top because I
feel like I only have a few running tops
and I wear the same ones and I've got
rid of the ones I don't really like and
I like tops when they're a little bit
looser when it comes to running cuz I
want to feel like I can breathe so I was
really excited about this one and I
think the color is so pretty I got these
little hair ties from forever 21 it was
literally a dollar but I'm running low
and I just thought these colors were
really pretty so I usually only buy
black or dark brown but I thought these
are actually really pretty neutral
colors I would still wear anywho so I
need to get some things done before this
busy week that I've got ahead of me so I
will catch you guys in my next vlog bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
