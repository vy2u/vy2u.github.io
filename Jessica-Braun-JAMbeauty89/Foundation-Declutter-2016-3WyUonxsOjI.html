BB creams powders things like that I'm
gonna organize them and then we will go
through them one by one
okay so here they are let's start over
here this is the it cosmetic celebration
foundation illumination one of my
favorite powder foundations of all time
it gives a lot of coverage but it makes
your skin look healthy not like weird
and dry and matte I love this so much so
you'll see that in a second I've been
trying to find a drugstore dupe for it
so I bought a lot of powders that I'll
probably get rid of because they're just
not nearly as good
so definitely keeping that this was one
I bought this is the NYX a matte but not
flat I just bought what I was trying to
say and it's very similar it's a powder
foundation
I'm trying it out to see if it is a dupe
I've had this before and I loved it but
it was a long long time ago so this
might be a dupe for this I'm gonna be
trying it out I love it keeping both
this I'm gonna get rid of this is the
Neutrogena mineral shears powder
foundation and it just it did make my
skin look really dry it had okay
coverage but it was just like a standard
drugstore powder that doesn't really
impress you very much so it I'm just
gonna get rid of it this I'm also gonna
get rid of this is the Ofra oil control
pressed powder it I don't like white
powders I just got this in a boxycharm
decently recently that's funny
and it just it kind of makes your skin
actually look white and I just don't
like the way it looks on my skin so I'm
gonna get rid of that one as well so
these are key let's get rid of okay this
Physicians Formula one I think I'm gonna
get rid of it's one of those cushion
foundations there was a huge trend for
like a hot second here in America and
then no one cared about anymore so I
bought two of them this one I didn't
love I really did like the L'Oreal one
so I'm gonna get rid of the Physicians
Formula one and keep the L'Oreal one
this I need to return this again I was
trying to look for a dupe for the
cosmetics one and it's the matte finish
and you guys all told me it's a dupe if
you get the illuminating finish so I
have the wrong one I'm going to return
it and then I'm gonna try and get the
correct one to see if it is this I love
it's the Maybelline better skin
transforming powder and
it's just a really nice powder
foundation it really it reminds me of
this to be honest I need to try them
side-by-side and see if it is this is
amazing for touch-ups especially it's
how I love to use it throughout the day
and it has a huge mirror so I think I'm
gonna take this with me to school and
it's gonna be in my makeup bag there
because it's literally the perfect
mirror the perfect powder for me to
lightly touch up throughout the day
definitely keeping it love it I'm gonna
get rid of the elf daily moisture stick
it's just it's I love the idea I used to
use it a lot where you just get a little
bit you can put it on any dry areas of
your face and adds moisture without
messing up your makeup but I literally
have not used it at all recently I'm
just gonna get rid of it same with these
these are elf oil absorbing pads it's a
cool idea where there's a sticky part
and it pulls up the actual little like
sheet to absorb the oil but ask me if
I've used it at all no I have not so I'm
gonna get rid of that this I'm so torn I
got I thought I was gonna get rid of
this a long time ago then I watched
videos and how people use it and I'm
like oh my gosh that's amazing so I kept
it I used it for quite some time but
it's just gotten really really gross and
there's not really a good way to clean
it it's kind of a silicone type cream
where you can use the little sponge that
comes with it to get some and put it on
dry areas and it soaks at the oil it
makes it look nice without adding powder
however it's just gotten so gross that I
don't even want to use it so I'm either
gonna find a way to clean it or just get
rid of it honestly I think I'm just
gonna get rid of it makes me sad but it
is what it is this is the boots number 7
perfect light loose powder and this is
the only loose powder I have and I feel
like I should have at least one in my
collection I just don't use it often but
I do like having at least one so if I
see a tutorial I'm like oh I want to try
that I want to at least have an option
and this really is nice it just kind of
mattifies your face it soaks up oil but
it also kind of perfects and blurs the
areas you use it in which is why I like
having it so I am going to keep that
this is the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
I just bought it
it is in the wrong shade I got it in 204
I got it in 205 and I need 204 now that
I've kind of figured out what shade I am
in the Loreal range so I'm going to get
rid of this see if I can return it
because I've literally only used it once
but I want to see how it is because I
did not like the pro mat just because I
have dry skin so I have a feeling I'm
gonna really like this but I'm gonna get
rid of it and get the right shade this
is another product to me to get rid of
this is the Bourjois healthy mix serum
and it's their gel foundation I bought
this when I was in Europe and I'm so sad
to say that I don't like it and I have
tried applying it with a brush with my
fingers with a sponge everything and it
never looks good it's what I decided is
it gives me like no coverage which is
fine but it also looks really obvious on
my skin like it won't blend into my skin
so it's just a really like two strikes
against this product so I'm just gonna
get rid of it
I keep holding on to it thinking oh
maybe it'll work but it never has so why
will it all of a sudden start working
I'm also getting rid of this this is the
Sonia Kashuk perfecting luminous
foundation cheap packaging I didn't like
the primer of this I don't like the
foundation it just sat on top of my skin
it did not blend anywhere it was all bad
it's got a pump which I like it's
overpriced I think this was like $15 I
might be wrong but if I remember right
was like $15 and certainly not worth it
like not even close so glad to get rid
of that sucker this is the dr. jart
Black Label detox beauty balm it's got
SPF of 25 I love this I'm definitely
keeping it probably my favorite BB cream
of all time well the one in the gold
tube is actually my favorite it has a
higher SPF but it's the same brand but
this one's really good as well I think
when I do use this up I'll probably
repurchase the gold one since now I know
I like it better
alright moving on this is the bare
minerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream and I have it in
wheat 4.5 and it's just a really nice
tinted moisturizer it has
decent amount of coverage not a ton but
it has a lot more coverage than actually
I would say these are pretty comparable
they're really similar products so I
really really like it and I think this
is actually a little bit more of an
accurate shade for me versus this they
don't really I think they have like two
shade options for this one if not just
one but this one I really like and I was
surprised that it doesn't break me out
because a lot of bare minerals like
powder products break me out like crazy
so I'm glad this one doesn't keeping all
right this is the Neutrogena Healthy
Skin illuminating tinted moisturizer and
this is an amazing drugstore tinted
moisturizer it just it's it is
lightweight like they say it has SPF of
30 and I love the packaging I just think
it's kind of cute and I love that it's
got a little squeezy tube that goes to a
point so you can be really you know you
can keep it clean and it's just got a
little bit of coverage but it's just
nice it's comfortable on the skin
doesn't break me out and I feel like
there are so many high end BB creams
that I like so I was excited to find you
know a tinted moisturizer type product
from the drugstore that was really good
so I'm definitely gonna keep that let's
do all of these at the same time because
they kind of all go together these are
all of my it cosmetics CC plus products
most of these except for this one was
sent to me at different times in
different like PR shipments so they're
all different shades this giant one
which is the illumination kind isn't
fair it's too light for me I've just got
to get rid of it I'm really sad but it's
just you like alright so these two are
the same product they're both in light
which is exactly my shade so I know I'm
gonna keep this one cuz I just bought it
and it's like the regular size this one
I kind of want to keep because I know
once I use this up I'm still going to
want more plus I can travel with it
this one I'm torn because it is a little
bit too dark for me but I've mixed these
together and I like it because it makes
it just a little bit deeper this one and
it also adds that little bit of
illumination it's really really pretty
so I think I am going to keep all of
these this is the L'Oreal visible lift
blur foundation it's one of the few
foundations actually these last three
are like the only foundation
other than I guess this that I own so I
really like this I didn't know that I
would but it's a really nice it's like a
thin consistency it blends into your
skin beautifully but it really does have
nice coverage and this is in 204 creamy
natural which I've realized is probably
what I should get for this L'Oreal one
as well so I'm definitely keeping that I
was so impressed this is the boots
number seven lift and luminate
foundation and I really like this as
well I need to use this some more you
can tell I haven't used a ton of it but
I liked it for the first times I've used
it a lot but it's been a while since
I've used it again so I feel like I need
to try it some more to determine if I
want to keep it for the long haul or not
this is one of my favorite foundations
it's from gorgeous cosmetics and it's
their base perfect foundation and I love
it this is actually an unopened one
clearly that I had had as a backup the
other one I've gotten rid of because it
had gotten really old so I don't want to
open this until I really really need it
but this is like my special occasion
type foundation you know what I mean so
this is what I'm keeping up here this is
what I'm getting rid of I think I did
pretty well I'm gonna be honest I
actually had filmed this specific video
just a little bit ago but I didn't turn
the microphone on so it recorded no
sound which is just the most frustrating
thing in the world but I'm glad it
happened because originally I wasn't
gonna get rid of this this this no this
this this this and that's it so there
were four more things when I went
through in a second time that I decided
you know what I am gonna get rid of it
so I'm actually really glad that
happened and some of these things like
once I use it up I'm not gonna rebuy
again so like obviously I don't need
both of these you know and I mean things
like that and these I'm gonna test out
and see you know if I love it all the
way to the end maybe already purchased
but by then I'll probably be ready to
try a different foundation so yeah I
think I did pretty well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
