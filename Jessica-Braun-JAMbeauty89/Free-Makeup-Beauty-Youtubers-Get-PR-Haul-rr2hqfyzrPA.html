going to do a PR call now the ahaha
where do I even begin
I always feel weird when I think about
filming one of these I don't know if
I've ever I think I've done a couple in
the past where maybe it was like half P
o box kind of PR haul but I always feel
a little awkward because I never want to
come across like I am bragging about
companies sending me things anything
like that this is my job it's well it's
one of my jobs so I hope you don't feel
like this is me saying look at what I'll
use coming to you this any me like this
not at all the point and that's why I
don't show everything because I never
wanted to feel that way but I know that
there's a lot of interest from you guys
and seeing what I am sent and while I'll
bring it up a lot of times in videos
I'll say Oh with someone so sent me this
or whatever
I don't always show everything and so
this is a video of things I've gotten in
the past week now there are months and
months of things I just haven't shown
and if I tried to backtrack and show
everything that I've been sent over the
past few months or year I mean there's
no way and some of that I declared
because I knew it wasn't right for me it
wasn't right shade so I gave it to
friends family etc but this is just
stuff that over the past few days I've
gotten so I figured I'd at least show
you that just because I know a lot of
you guys are interested so let's go
ahead and get into it so I've actually
okay lore'l sent me something but I put
a lot of this in here so I've taken a
lot of it out of the packaging because I
wasn't sure that I was going to film
this or not
and I don't know how in depth I'm going
to be able to get with all of these
products just because it's a lot so
let's start with Sigma has this new like
subscription box I think it is and it's
like their mystery kit so there were
four things in that mystery kit the
first thing was this little Sigma Spa
little like not handheld it's got little
suction cups you'd suction it to either
your counter or your sink whatever and
then you don't have to have it like a
glove on your hand and you can just work
your brush through it after you've
dipped it maybe in some kind of a
cleansing solution I usually use like
baby shampoo I switch all the time
it's just whatever I have on hand
honestly but I think that's a cool idea
I actually bought like a cleansing glove
from Amazon for like five dollars if I
can find it I will link it I love it
because you just flip it on your hand
it's a silicone glove with all these
textures on it kind of similar to this
but and then I could just have the brush
I dip it in the solution get it wet and
then I just work it through on this
little it's kind of like an oven mitt
kind of a glove so I really do like that
but I'll certainly give this a try this
might be great for if I'm traveling and
I know maybe it's a longer trip and I
know that I might need or want to clean
my brushes I think that's pretty cool
the next thing in their little Sigma
mystery kit was this embellish lash I
used to be a Sigma affiliate I'm sure I
still am but I don't even know like how
to make the link so I'll just link
Sigma's website below if you're
interested in trying you this I don't
you know I feel like I I don't know I've
never really found that many sigma
products that i've loved yet there were
some I really like like I've liked their
blushes but in a lot of their brushes
I've liked but I'm not like I know there
used to couple years ago there used to
be like a huge Sigma base here on
YouTube and I was never really a big
part of that but this is the embellished
lash mascara it is purple fun it's like
a nice violet purple like truly so
that's kind of cool it's got a silicone
kind of brush I might give that a try
you never know next thing in here is
their lip eclipse what is it it doesn't
say in Sigma pink so the color is Sigma
pink I don't know if it's like a matte
lipstick it's a smaller little tube
oh it's very very opaque that's pretty
though looks like it might be just a
really opaque kind of gloss I don't
think it's necessarily matte but we'll
keep an eye on it while it's on my hand
as I'm going through the next few things
and we'll see like does it dry down have
no idea and then the last thing in there
little mystery kit is this Sigma girl
color pop not like the brand color pop
but color pop collection brush kit so it
has three brushes in the kit since
they're a 25 for blending e55 for eye
shading and f40 large angled contour
oh so it's in a little tin kind of cool
so it looks like these are more like
travel-size
brushes which is pretty cool so this is
their e 25 so it's kind of a flat
it says blending it feels definitely
like them synthetic and then the next
one the next one is their f40 large
angled contour again it definitely has
that synthetic feel to it which is not
always my favorite kind of depends on
the brush and the purpose for the brush
this one looks nice so this is their a
55 eye shading brush again very
synthetic feeling but would be really
good at packing on color on the lid so I
will have to give these a try but I
don't know the price of their mystery
kit put the price if I can find it below
if you're curious about that if you
really are into that or you're wanting
something new from Sigma every month or
again I really don't know the deal on
this I just opened that last night I had
no idea next thing I got in the mail was
from Mac and it was this huge like not
freeze-dried but like vacuum sealed I
really just think freeze-dried in my
head vacuum sealed pack of like 18 or 20
of their new metallic lipstick so I have
them all just in here I'll swatch some
of them for you so they're all like kind
of foiled metallic kind of lipsticks now
you guys know my feeling on mac
lipsticks if you saw my products what do
they call that video well whatever it
was what was products that maybe I
wasn't blown away by that I was just
kind of I've changed my mind about I
just feel like MAC lipsticks across the
board are just drying I have to reapply
all the time at the end of the day my
lips just look crazy like I don't know
but these were really fun so this one's
in foils rose and it's just like fun
like purplish metallic and all of them
are in their standard Mac bullet style
lipstick packaging this one has some of
the glitter on it modern mitis so it's
kind of a more golden tone some of these
are really fun like I might actually use
them on my lips a lot of them I might
pass on to friends just because I know
myself and I know I wouldn't wear it
this one's in lust it's a little bit
lighter and more kind of rosy than that
but still I mean this would be one I
don't think I could pull off it might be
too light for my lips
and some fun ones oh this one a see
these are all kind of similar the ones
i'm swatching here this one's in pale
rose I think I will wear that one it's a
really pretty definitely metallic but
it's a little bit more pink so it's a
little more wearable but these
definitely all have shimmer to them I
mean no doubt about that this one's a
more brown tone it's called axe so cool
I just will swatch them all I guess
while I'm at it I'll try and do it
quickly this one's in Jupiter it's a
little bit more of a deeper than the
gold ones I've done it's still really
pretty though next one is in nightly
ritual this one is a really kind of like
charcoal grey with the shimmer if you're
into that I will say though these are
creamier than I would have expected for
a metallic lip this is in metal head
similar to that last one a lot of these
are really some of this one this one
maybe is a little bit deeper hard to
tell
keep going this one's in Hades fire oh
my gosh this one's kind of very like in
a way I might wear that one that's
really pretty I don't love the title of
it but I like the shade this one's
called cold front and it's like a
periwinkle with glitter just straight-up
glitter in this one if you can see that
isn't that cool though
again I probably wear it I just like
looking at it this one's in silver spoon
and it's like a kind of well very light
gray okay almost done
this one's in royal hour and it's like a
purple my like a purple I mean
definitely a purple kind of a bluish
purple though this one is in Xero cool
and it's in I mean it's a straight-up
green would have been great for st.
Patrick's Day
oh my gosh but again lots of glitter in
it if you don't like that you will
absolutely hate these stay far far away
this one's in pearly one and it's more
of like a white kind of you see what I'm
saying
I mean maybe like on the center of your
bottom lip maybe
almost done I promise devotional is a
little more wearable I'll probably try
that one out that's right there it's
kind of a grayish pink
it's got like a purple duochrome in
there this one's in digging for gold so
another kind of gold in one a lot of the
gold ones look really similar so you
certainly wouldn't need more than one of
them if you were really into that two
more this one's in disobedience this one
looks pretty yes this is totally up my
alley this one is like the one I swatch
last night I thought yes I will actually
wear that so so beautiful and then this
one is anything once and it's like a
darker blue shade so these are really
pretty really shimmery glittery creamier
than I would have expected
not necessarily once I would have
purchased on my own but it's fun to show
you guys these so I'll link MAC
lipsticks below and I'll try to list all
the shades in order so the next thing
I'm a centrist from L'Oreal and it was
this whole cute box of all kinds of
their infallible paints no way I'm going
to be able to watch all these right now
but if you'd like like a dedicated
review let me know but they sent me
their infallible paints now they send me
a few our package before with these and
I didn't show them there's a lot of
colors I would never wear on my list so
it was like the blue purple you know but
they did send a few more I think they
sent every shade but there's like this
berry one that's in the shade sultry
sangria so it's got kind of a chair like
applicator and this one is so freakin
pretty if you like deep wine light
colors you would love it now I haven't
tried the formula out this truly is like
a whole kind of a video they also have
this more neutral one called spicy blush
and it's a really pretty peachy nude a
little bit deeper than peach but I like
it and of course they have brighter ones
too but this one's called nude star I
think this one's a little bit deeper
than oh no it's just maybe a little more
yeah it's a little bit deeper those are
really close but you can see the dip
and it is picking it up correctly in the
camera because I'm just a natural
lighting today but then they do have
more bright colors so they have Wild
Rose which is this really pretty more
mid-tone brighter pink actually a little
bit brighter than mid tough but I like
the packaging of these it's a squeeze
you tube mixed with the doe foot
applicator like both worlds here they do
have some red so they have this one in
DIY red sea I have a swatch ooh it's
definitely more of a warm red it's
really pretty though these are really
really pigmented super creamy
they are glossy but they're they're nice
so I feel like if you put a lip liner on
and put this on on top of that you know
you might have to reapply throughout the
day but it's still nice they also sent
their infallible paints blush they only
from my understanding they only have one
of these and these are bright they are
not playing around about that and so
let's kind of swatch these so here they
are there they certainly are bright this
is like heavy heavily swatched these
watch pretty well the first time but I
just kind of filled out the tail end of
them if you're not really into these
other colors there's no purpose in
trying these out right I mean that
should be common sense but I know
sometimes it helps to hear someone tell
you that if you are not into these
colors it doesn't matter how new or good
it is you're never going to wear it
I like the peachy shade here but even
that like that was the one thats watched
the least best that was the one that's
watched the worst so if that were the
only one you were into it's not worth
buying the whole thing because that's
the worst one in the for palette so
something to think about and then the
other thing that was in here other than
all of the infallible paints and if you
want to see really quickly I'll show you
like a very different color of those
lips this is a purple one in violent
twist
all of them are pigmented like this so
whether you get the blue the green
whatever you can expect it to look like
what it looks like in the tube right
really really cool colors so if you want
a bright color this is a great line to
try alright so they also set all of
their in
malleable paints eyeshadow so these are
these little duo's of cream shadow and
I'm going to try some that I would be
more into so this is a more nude one
this one's called nude fishnet and so it
has like a kind of more matte color and
then on the other side on this one at
least it has a more shimmery color
that's similar so be really pretty these
are really thin formula they seem like
they'd be really you know they glide
easily very comfortable it's actually
really pretty blended out they blend out
really beautifully surprised me so let's
try a more pigmented one so let's try
these turquoises so this one's been mint
detox so this is like the matte shade oh
my gosh and then this is like the
shimmery shade Oh or maybe it's not
necessarily matte well but it kind
of looks like that anyway here they are
aren't those ridiculous so these are
really neat so if you're wanting more
merit wearable shades this one's in
Mistress noir that's a lot darker
there's like a green and a black what
else this is another wearable one called
cool ivory let me swatch this one looks
like there's like a light shimmery gold
that's so up my alley and then a more
like champagne light and a more white
based one if you can even see it on my
light skin tone there they are you can
see it so really pretty colors a cool
formula I liked it it two duo instead of
just buying one single and then they
also sent these liquid liners it's their
infallible paints liquid eyeliners okay
this blew me away when I swapped it last
night this one's in vivid aqua these are
just like beautiful felt tip liner very
very thin very very very pigmented
I expected it to be kind of watery I got
to be honest but they blew me away so
this is the black one called black party
and I was like wow that is really black
really easy to apply I want to put this
to the
next to my favorite Stila stay all day
liquid eyeliner because of course that's
way more expensive more than double the
price but I mean if this is just as good
then this is an amazing dupe for it they
also have this beautiful turquoise
called intrepid teal again like this
peel one in the blue and they dry down
like matte it is so gorgeous these are
so pigmented so that blew me away here's
another blue and they've a lot of Blues
called electric blue and it's very
similar to the other teal when I did but
it's right there on the end so so pretty
so thanks Laurie oh that was really cool
I'm excited to try this now will I keep
all of those absolutely not
there's no way I don't I won't wear them
all so I will pass a lot of them on but
it's certainly fun to try and definitely
a lot of fun colors and pretty good
quality okay so continuing on drunken
elephant actually just recently sent me
some things a lot of people talk about
them like a lot of people and so
naturally I'm skeptical conceit I'm sure
a lot of you guys are too but they
contact me said hey can we send you some
stuff and my response is always yes but
I can't guarantee that I'll review them
that the review will be positive etc so
they were like okay so they sent me some
things so the first thing in here is
this these little like bought like soaps
and it's the P key bar the one special
okay the P key bar like a soap there's
two different marks I mean that one
clarifies balance with moisturizers and
then the juju bar cleanses and exfoliate
so interesting so the P key bar has
marula blueberry extract honey
and then the 2g bar has choose you I
like saying that juju bar has thermal
mud marula super fruit in bands ooh so I
will try those I'm not big on bar soaps
generally whether it's for my face body
anything but I'm always willing to try
next thing this one has a sticker on it
it was the best of beauty allure 2016
award winner it's the Lala retro whipped
cream rehab and recover as six rare
African oils says it's a retro style
moisturizer whipped into an airy blend
of six exotic African oils to deliver
intense hydration replenishing infant
long-lasting relief
loaded with antioxidant rich plantain
extract green tea firms and brightens
pians appearance diminishes age spots
rich in creamy without being heavy
greasy or suffocating cheese a silky
dream come true for tired skin so it's
got pretty packaging why it was like a
light kind of lavender oh it's one of
those push down things so you push that
down and it comes up into it it says
it's completely non irritating always
blows my mind that a product can say
it's non-irritating and mindful how is
it possible that no one could possibly
be irritated by it it's just an
interesting phrase that skincare
companies can use anyway so I'm very
excited to try that
I'm assuming it's for your face right I
mean yeah right next thing they sent was
the Shabak complex I serum awaken repair
renew has copper peptides coq10
Edelweiss stem cell says they're really
thin that's kind of fun
oh oh it's like a little tip oh oh I
squirted it into the tip so it you push
this and it comes out the little tip
here doesn't have a bit of fragrance
which I love at least not that I can
smell just feels really moisturizing so
that's for your eyes again a lot of
these it's truly a haul I'm going to
have to get back to you guys because I
you know I don't know how these are
going to wear next thing is a TLC Fran
boos glycolic night serum as raspberry
extract horse-chestnut and 12% H a blend
I just ordered a bunch of stuff from the
ordinary and it's really inexpensive so
it's going to be interesting trying
these alongside those maybe I'll have to
do them one at a time because I ordered
like a lot of stuff from there and I've
been trying it out and I'm really liking
it so we'll see but this is one of those
patents their packaging really is cute
so you turn it and it goes up runs me of
my polished choice serum you might it
says you might experience tingling with
this but it's at night serum so I'm
excited to give this a try the next
thing is their virgin marula luxury
facial oil
people love the
stuff love it so again they're really
smart in their packaging because they've
got like the little bits of fluorescent
stuff they've got like a mint so they've
got all different colors that look
really fun together and I know that
sounds dumb I know that sounds kind of
dumb but in this day and age where so
many people you know advertise on
Instagram and you know through pictures
and things like that
it's smart of them to make them look
really cute together anyway that was the
business side of me talking so this is
their marula luxury facial oil it says a
wonder-working luxury facial oil that's
high in critical antioxidants Omega 6
and 9 hydrates preserve seals your skin
restores glow straight from the tip p IP
pips of the marula fruit are virgin
marula oil is virtually untouched by any
chemical afraid Rijn fragrance natural
or synthetic remains in its purest form
that is awesome that I like to hear so
it's just a little drop or bottle and
it's just a clear oil
ya know fragrance it's just so I mean
it's certainly an oil I mean it just
feels like an oil I was gonna say it
feels really smooth but that's how like
every oil ever feels so I'm excited to
give this a try on my face and see how
my face like marula oil but I love that
it's fragrance free
nonsense free basically and they also
sent their si firma day serum so I have
their night serum now I've got their day
serum and it says it's a vitamin C serum
packed with powerful antioxidant complex
for rule ik acid chrono peptide that
transforms into vitamin D to reveal a
brighter firmer and more even looking
complexion as pumpkin ferment extract
the helps enzymatically dissolve
unwanted surface skin cells as it
intensely hydrates that sounds awesome
result has a noticeably diminished
appearance of UV photo damage and aging
replaced by radiance and monopsony so
again it's got that cute twisting like
the other serum did so the night is pink
and the oranges that's interesting you
think the night would be like blue but
anyway so these are cute but it doesn't
mean they're good so I'm going to let
you guys know as I try these how I
like them so that's why I'm going to
show you guys today again if I go back
even a couple weeks I've got tons more
but it's it's too much for one video but
I'll try to do these from time to time
as I get you know maybe bigger
collections of things if you're
interested in seeing them if you hated
this video let me know if you love this
video let me know but like I said I
don't want to come across like I'm
bragging I'm just trying to show you
guys stuff show you guys new things that
are out there etc other than that I hope
that you'll subscribe in the meantime to
catch my actual reviews and demos and
things like that that I think maybe are
a little bit more helpful for two
classes otherwise I hope you'll come say
hi on my social media which is Jam
beauty 89 on all of my accounts and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
