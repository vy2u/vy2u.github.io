ready together and I'm just gonna be
trying a bunch of new products I always
try to do some kind of an update maybe a
month from now with how these products
are performing now that I've used it
more because for most of these it's the
first time I'm using them some of them
I've used them two or three times
already so it's a mixed bag of things I
already know a little bit about and then
of course if I don't have something
that's new I'm just using something else
that I can tell you about so hopefully
that makes sense
ia just realize I need to go wet my
sponge so I'll be right back and then
we'll get started where to begin so
let's start with primer this is one I
have tried a couple times now this is
the first aid Beauty coconut skin
smoothing priming moisturizer now I
don't think this is a new product some
of you guys have told me you've tried it
in it so I think it's been out for a
while but they just recently sent it to
me and I was surprised at how much I
liked it so it's kind of got this beige
color to it it almost looks like it's
pearly but it doesn't really like come
across like shimmery or anything on your
face but it is such a nice moisturizing
moisturizer I mean it's a primer and so
I actually had already moisturized my
skin but this is so like softening like
it's so skin softening and I'll even put
it lightly on my under eye and it just
oh it really is smoothing not in a pore
filling you know kind of silicon velvety
kind of a way more of a moisturizing
smooth I really I haven't really tried a
lot of products I think I like this
better than the Smashbox primer Iser I
really do because I feel like it gives a
little bit of a glow to my skin
obviously neither one of them are
perfecting I mean I've obviously got
some stuff on my skin that I like to
cover from day to day but right I think
I like it better now does it smell
strongly a coconut it definitely has a
slight smell but it's nothing so strong
it doesn't even have a smell no I don't
notice the smell and what's funny is I
feel like some of you guys commented
when I showed this on I don't know
snapchat I think one morning I was
getting ready uh a lot of you like oh I
love the small doubt but I don't even
know that this has a smell regardless I
really I'm enjoying this and this is
like I said I've used it a couple times
so now that we are moisturized and
primed I did want to try this okay this
is a very expensive product from tatcha
and it's called their silk canvas filter
finish again they recently sent this to
me and it's this giant like pan cake
just a pan it's not pinky okay
My Mind's in ten thousand places hold on
this is good there's no way this video
isn't super long I'm sorry ahead of time
I can't help it so it comes with this
little like spatula if you will that you
can kind of scrape off a very light
layer on the top they said and they said
like literally this is probably too much
they set a rice sized amount for your
entire face so I'm using a very very
tiny amount and I'm just gonna press it
into my nose because that's the area
this is supposed to be a pore filling
again kind of a primer if you will but
I'm using a very very very small amount
and just kind of blending it outward
I've tried a product like this the Tarte
timeless smoothing primer thing and I
really it's okay I just don't love it
but I tried this the other day and I was
like oh actually my nose held on to the
foundation all day that is very rare now
do it was it perfect at the end of the
day no it wasn't perfect but was it much
better than it usually is at the end of
a long day of work
yeah and that's huge because obviously
my nose is red and I feel like
foundation just breaks apart where it
just looks so weird up close so weird
and I know some of you guys are out
there like yes yes yes I know what you
mean
so I'm really gonna be putting this
product to the test because if this
works first of all this thing is gonna
last you freaking forever like I'm never
gonna run out of this coz use the
tiniest amount but it just seemed to
hold on to foundation really well my
nose I don't think I need it anywhere
else on my face everywhere else usually
the foundation will sit pretty well you
could probably tap it up here you could
blend it out a little bit chin maybe but
I think other than that I don't know
that you nest
surely need this everywhere I guess it
depends though I shouldn't say never
because totally depends on your skin
type and if you've got larger pores
elsewhere that you want to kind of fill
okay I'm talking too much about this but
so far I do really like it I do feel
like it's pretty effective but again I
just want to keep trying it for a little
while longer so the foundation I want to
try we're going from like super high-end
a super drugstore Rimmel who makes one
of my favorite foundations the lasting
finish which a red top I can link that
below as well very good coverage like
medium you can build it to even medium
full I just really like it
it wears really well on my skin
throughout the day well this is their
lasting finish breathable and they sent
me a couple shades so they sent me
eighty one fare ivory and then a little
bit darker is 103 true ivory and this is
different because it has a giant doe
foot applicator a lot of a lot of
companies are doing this now which is
better than just an open jar I will say
that so yeah I mean obviously ideally
pump but this is nice because you can
just kind of swipe it onto your face so
I'm gonna use my favorite L'Oreal sponge
again I can link that below I'll try to
link everything I'm using I always do so
we've got our primer on so I'm just
gonna kind of it's the right shade I
think it is I think it's a little dark
but the other one is way too light so
this ended up working I love this doe
foot it's really fat it's really soft
I've used this foundation once before so
this is only my second time using it now
you can see already that it covered a
bit but not everything there's still
lots of redness I'm seven months
pregnant and I've just got all more
redness than usual just a little bit
more splotchy skin more breakouts always
in this region is that normal for
pregnancy like it's always right here or
right here it's so weird nowhere else
not even on my chin really and that's
where I used to break out when it was
like a hormonal that time of the month
kind of break out breathable is
certainly an acceptable term for this
because we're gonna really see cuz I've
got some redness here it's a very good
term for this because it's so I mean it
is lightweight do I think it makes your
skin look natural not really because
what I remembered I kept looking in the
mirror and thinking you know it still
looks like foundation but it doesn't
have the
coverage of other foundations so it's
like so is it worth it there are other
products out there that that can kind of
give you a little bit more coverage and
look like foundation you know or if you
want less if you want it to look more
natural there are some really good high
coverage BB creams out there that looks
so much more like your own skin than
this and have a little bit more coverage
I don't know if what I'm saying is
making sense but I just felt like this
didn't have great coverage and it didn't
look super natural so it was like so
then what are what do we have we've got
a foundation that looks okay but when
you get up close I don't know but it is
a thin layer and that's something I do
appreciate well it can still look dry if
you have dry skin I'm curious if you
have oily skin how this would look
because I don't think it's I mean it's
not a dewy finish foundation not in my
opinion but I'm like literally painting
my face with this because I know it's so
like low coverage does anyone else
getting ready while you're watching this
comment below if you are always curious
like I like to watch get ready with me
is when I'm actually getting ready just
cuz it's feels more legit so I will say
this about it one pro it blends quickly
I mean I feel like it doesn't take much
so let's see how much we can build this
up really gonna tackle that area up
there where I have more redness so this
is the second layer and of course you
could use a brush I just feel like with
this it looks just a little bit more
natural with the sponge so that did
cover more redness so it's buildable for
sure but it's never gonna give you a
full full coverage look if you've got
serious skin concerns I just don't think
this is gonna be your BFF I just don't
and one other gone sorry Pinocchio
Sparky I'm sure at a mailman
one other con of this is that when you
again this is kind of a small one but
when you pull the dough fit out it
constantly is like splurging out more of
this product and it's getting like on my
tabletop it's gotten on my pants so
something to be aware of like if for
some reason you get dressed before you
get ready like with your makeup this
might get on your clothes and that's
actually now that I'm saying that a lot
I'm like actually that is kind of a con
because
and I don't know that there's a fix for
that because the dope foot kind of
flares out and then it pulls through the
thing it kind of makes sense and this is
a very liquidy formula so all right I'm
gonna be done with this I think in the
end it does give a nice look this is not
the worst foundation I've ever tried if
it sounds like something you'd like you
know where it's kind of light medium ish
maybe coverage not super dewy not super
matte kind of right in between so what I
put my Jam p89 complete samples of
approval on this no but do I think it's
terrible no I think it's fine if you had
a great coupon and you were dying to try
it because you know that just kind of a
more lightweight simple foundation was
more your speed go for it but like I
said it definitely can give the look of
foundation it definitely looks like
there's something on your skin I guess
what I mean by that is like if you have
peach fuzz you're gonna kind of see it
that you know and I certainly do alright
so the concealer I'm using is actually
just gonna be this one from Catrice
they're liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer I know there's so many
youtubers that rave about this I have it
in 0/10 porcelain that might be the
lightest shade I've used this a couple
times now and I was pretty impressed I
have to admit I was ready to be like
super judgy I don't know why well this
stuff actually was really impressive
look at the difference whoa whoa and
it's such a thin formula like the Tarte
shaped tape is good it's got good
coverage but it's it's just a little
thick you know and it's very very drying
so I've tried to mix it with more
moisturizing products and it'll look
okay I still like it I mean I'm still
gonna use it there's a reason there's a
cult following but you know I can't use
it every day it just it makes it ages me
because of my crinkles under my eye
alright so coverage 100% A+ I mean
really truly I never feel like I need
like a corrector at the same time you
know anything like that it's a very very
thin formula but I mean it's so
inexpensive I want to say right around
five dollars maybe a little bit more I
really really like it says it's
waterproof I will trust that I don't
need to conceal everything and jump in
Poole right this second but I really do
like it does it signify minds definitely
but not nearly as bad as other
concealers I've used and so that's
something I'm like not bad I am going to
set it with another new product this is
from essence it's their brighten up
banana powder it looks a lot like my
favorite NYX HD powder in banana very
very similar light light yellow and it's
just perfect for setting excuse me it's
perfect for setting the under eyes so
what I like to do is get it on my brush
like plenty and then I like to go back
in and make sure it's not sunk into the
fine lines for like 10 seconds before it
does and then go in with this and just
like set the under eye kind of flare it
out a little bit what I've noticed about
this product and you're probably already
seeing it is it ages me it really really
does it's while it may stop some of the
products from getting into my little
under eye crinkles I feel like it makes
it look really creepy and dry and for
some reason the NYX HD powder doesn't do
that and they're both inexpensive so if
you're choosing between the two I would
go with the next one
just because I really I feel like it
emphasizes this area right here so like
my crinkles start here and go up right
right here
I have no fine lines and yet it looks
like I do when I put this on and I'm
like I almost didn't try it on on camera
cuz I was like I'm gonna have to look
like this all day but I really wanted
you guys to see how this worked and I've
gotta go out today see if you see some
family it may be like ooh here look at
old Jesse when I do my brows really
quickly with my hourglass arch brow
pencil just one of my favorites it's
expensive but I love it lasts me quite a
while I know some people are
particularly they don't like the
triangular shape I actually really like
it makes it really quick for me so we're
gonna go ahead and do eyes next to them
will pop back into face so I'm just
starting on my uLTA Beauty matte eye
primer I don't have a new eye primer to
try right now and this is one that I
absolutely love it's kind of a beige
color cancels out some
redness veining any weird discoloration
you might have but it really does a
great job of holding on to shadow and
this is something that's gonna take me
forever to use up which I appreciate and
today we're trying I literally got this
in the mail last night from profusion
it's they're mixed metals peach palette
I know that profusion some of their
stuff is sold at Target I'll try to find
a link for this it's a really nice
looking palette i've swatched it's
watched well we'll see how it actually
goes onto the eye and how it looks once
it's blended I tried some other
profusion palettes and I've liked them
but none of them have been so good that
I felt like oh my gosh like I need to
share this with everyone so these colors
are totally up like everyone's alley
right now not everyone's but like it's a
very popular kind of a spread of colors
very warm peachy of course is so big so
I'm gonna throw polite which is like
this you know kind of whitish does have
a little bit of shimmer in it all over
so I'm gonna start it in the brow bone
with a fluffy brush and just kind of
place it all over the lid crease
everywhere just kind of setting that
primer so it's not too sticky anymore
these kind of have a peach smell to
interesting all right so I'm gonna throw
I'm just curious to try this it's kind
of a light pink and this is only gonna
work if you're like near my skin tone I
think because it's so light but I kind
of want to throw this in the crease and
just see again this is not even like a
super matte but I just want to know how
will this look like that's kind of a
buffer starter crease color again you'd
have to pick a maybe a different shade
depending on your skin tone because this
is super light it's certainly not gonna
show up this way on everyone I'm quite
aware but just to kind of get the ball
rolling
so it's probably not super-dee-duper
obvious but I do think doing things like
that can really help your shadow look a
little more seamless when you're adding
other colors just because it's kind of
creating starting to create that shadow
so it won't be quite as drastic in a way
so I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
a smaller brush and this is the shade do
I want to do that yeah let's do outgoing
it's kind of a peachy shade
so I've kind of placed the shadow I mean
this is pretty pigmented it seems to be
blending really well with that other
color
okay so blending wise I really feel like
this is blending really nicely like
really nicely like I think of my Marc
Jacobs shadows that I've been using
lately and how I'll create honestly I
look very similar to this a very light
look for everyday has been kind of my
go-to and I feel like this is blending
just as well as those do now do I think
it's blending too well or it's blending
away I feel like it's kind of looking
like it's well maybe it doesn't I can't
tell if it's my lighting the veins in my
eye or what but it kind of looked like
it was skipping a little bit I just had
to take a break because Tyler made some
breakfast and it was so so good so that
was nice anyway alright so continuing on
with the eye look thirty minutes later
I'm gonna take a darker color and kind
of put it in the outer corner I think
I'm gonna go with you don't do the brown
I feel like I often time go for the reds
but I think I'm gonna go for the brown
today
by the way the brown is called special
so let's go with this kind of more
brownish kind of bronzy shade with some
shimmer
it's called certain and I'm just gonna
use my finger
it's definitely more kind of orangey
bronze which I don't mind I don't know
guys I feel like this is okay
I don't think it's a terrible palette
but like the Milani palettes that are
new I think are just better I mean this
is just okay like if you were already
purchasing a bunch of stuff or if you
these colors are really up your alley I
think maybe but I just don't feel like I
feel like it blended really well but
like I said a little too well and the
more I used it it just all kind of
blended together but with that being
said I am gonna throw a little bit more
of the dark brown out here just to kind
of get this to look a little bit more
visually interesting and then I guess
just not blended alrighty so moving
along I got these L'Oreal infallible
long-wear eye pencils so they have quite
a few colors they're all really creamy
I'm gonna use the black one I'm just to
kind of tightline my eyes
super black super creamy I mean gliding
right on I've even used these this week
like on my waterline they stay pretty
well they don't say like all day but
they stay pretty well but it's not like
a 14-hour waterline kind of a thing
although I've never really found a liner
to last that long on me but I've got
very like watery eyes I guess I don't
know now it also comes with this like
peach color like a kind of nude color
and I want to put that on my waterline
if you have a similar skin tone to mine
it definitely looks pretty natural like
it brightens the area but it's like a
more natural bright I probably should
have waited to do that because I just
remembered I also I'm trying out this is
one that I purchased and the same day
that I got it in the mail from Ulta
essence sent it to me so I thought that
was kind of funny but it's their cushion
eyeliner I've been using this all week
and I really really like it now treat it
like paint because that's more like what
it is it's not really it's well no it's
not a cream it's more of a liquid liner
but
like in cushion form um so you can use
like a favorite brush with it so I'm
using my Mac 263 266 Bret whatever this
is their could their angle dye liner
brush and I'm literally just dipping it
into the cushion and it gets it all over
the brush and you have to be a little
more careful
so black oh my gosh it is so black keep
like holding my breath can't breathe so
my wings are not perfect but I'm gonna
use just my favorite NYX epic ink liquid
liner to clean it up so my thing is I'm
getting used to using this cushion
eyeliner is I always end up with a way
thicker line that I mean to cuz it's I'm
just getting used to using it so it's
definitely I think there's a learning
curve to this but I do think it's really
nice and it stays black all day long so
I don't think my wings are perfectly
even but that is life so um the mascara
that I'm trying is from L'Oreal as well
it's their voluminous superstar X fiber
I'm gonna comb through my lashes and
curl them real fast so there's a step
one step two I don't usually like fibre
mascaras but I figure it's worth the try
so Oh step one is not a white fiber that
I appreciate so I'm just kind of combing
it through my lashes cuz I hate when
it's the white fiber because I feel like
you can always see through it you know
do I put it on right away or do I wait I
figure it's probably fine to do right
away so the brush is kind of a somewhat
curved brush more natural like bristles
it's holding it well it's certainly
holding the curl that I that's wow I
can't even like get a full sentence out
it's looking kind of nice it's not super
clumpy so far it's definitely black
it's lengthening them it's curling them
let's try the other side
I mean the primer or whatever itself it
kind of looks more mascara like it's
just so interesting so let me try my
lower lashes with just the mascara I
don't think I want the primer and
mascara on this just looking this that
powder on my under eye is so bad it's so
so bad I have a drawer in my closet
dedicated to regrets that when it gets
somewhat full I'll do a video of product
regrets and this is honestly going
straight in there I don't need to try it
anymore it looks even I'm you know a
foot and a half away from my mirror and
even from there it just does not look
good so all in all I like the mascara I
mean it held a curl it definitely
darkened and lengthened do I think it
added a ton of volume not a ton but I
really I like it so again I'll be
curious to see as I try it more and more
does it hold the curl throughout the day
that's I'm realizing one of the most
important things for me because I like
to do thicker liner on top
I want my mascara to hold a curl so you
can still see the lashes above the liner
does that make sense so when I can't
that's when I know
okay this mascara is not for me so I
wanted to try this Catrice color
neutralizer a mattifying primer I've got
some areas of my skin that I feel like
just I don't know so I'm wanting to
throw a little bit of this on to see if
it'll kind of neutralize like my nose
has a little bit of redness coming
through so this is one of those powders
that has different colors I'm gonna put
some on my nose I feel like that might
have gotten rid of a little bit of
redness and you know I've used this a
couple times this week now in lieu of
powder foundation in lieu of loose
powder and I think it does alright I
mean it's certainly a powder I mean you
see it it's you know I can even see on
my chin like powder there so at the end
of this look I well at the end of every
day when I'm getting ready I always end
up spraying it with a bunch of setting
spray to kind of melt it all together
and it does look better that way but
it's like I said it's definitely a
powder I'm not worrying about covering
this up I could but
I don't I don't know I I'm coming at
that point where if it's just like a
small pimple I don't really care is that
terrible because sometimes when you take
concealer and stuff on top of it it just
looks gross anyway and then like the
redness eventually will peep through and
then you also have the gross cakiness
I'm like a lot of times I'll just leave
it alone and it I it's just not that big
of a deal you know not that many people
are looking at me that closely where
they even care
all right I'm a little nervous for this
next step I want to try this blush and
it's a gel blush so it's from butter
LONDON it's their glaze and blush gelee
janay it's got a little lid I guess you
got to keep it because it says closed
lid tight for it to last and let me just
watch it this is in the shade you sent
me all of the shades but this one's
dazzle so it's I don't know guys I think
it says to do it with your fingers on
let me make sure I've got like a brush
no I'll use my sponge to blend it once I
put it on that way it'll kind of we'll
see
so looks like not a lot but it we're so
it really is like a jelly and you touch
it and you get it on your finger so I'm
just gonna kind of get it in that area
and then I'm just gonna oh no oh no
well that is my greatest fear it's just
stuck there I can't even like I guess
you could I rubbed it a little and it
kind of blended it but you see this is
what if people don't like to use these
kinds of products if they stick you
can't it's so hard to move now it's
looking a little bit better alright
let's keep trying for the sake of
science
you're gonna need like a little bit more
I like waiting too long I feel like this
is like rubbing away any foundation I
had on because I'm having to like really
pull and tug this looks terrible oh my
gosh I mean I guess once I've rubbed it
it looks alright but I've rubbed away
the foundation in that area it certainly
looks better over here where I had less
of it I think I don't like this I don't
even think this is not here's the thing
I feel like a lot of companies like oh
it's so fun and different you know it's
a jelly type but that doesn't mean it's
gonna be a good format for something and
you know I'm not mad at butter LONDON
but just generally I feel like so many
brands it's awesome that they're trying
new things but you know are they trying
to get on their face and thinking you
know this really doesn't work very well
and it literally says on the Box to only
use your fingers so yes I was cheating
and breaking the rules by using a sponge
but if I only use my fingers it's gonna
be this really weird uneven blotch so
and I had like none on my fingers so I'm
sure if you are at the most amazing
makeup artist you can make this work cuz
you can probably make anything work I'm
not a makeup artist and most of their
customers are not gonna be makeup
artists it's too much work to do so I'm
going to put a different blush on top of
this just because I want to you know I'm
gonna film a couple videos today and I
want it to look a little more put
together um so I'm just gonna pull in oh
I do have these things from Catrice
maybe I'll just do this it's they're
strobing blush this is in mrs. amber
Brown it's more of a peachy so I'm just
gonna put this kind of on top for them
umm this is new actually too I didn't
even realize I still had this okay
that's already looking so much better
dig in this I haven't used this yet this
is a nice color if you knew my skin tone
if you're not wanting to like contour
and stuff it's a nice blush color to
kind of blend back and I feel like it
still kind of works you know so well I'm
glad I'm in the weirdest way glad that
the glaze and thing didn't work because
I ended up really liking this so bonus
Jonas they also have just
serious this other color it's more of a
pink oh no I have two other colors so
this one's mrs. summer peach and then
this one is mrs. Rosalie berry so I have
three of these these are really really
pretty
and you can buy Katrice at Ulta so
speaking of liquid products that make me
nervous I want to try this essence make
me glow highlighter although I can
usually get down with highlighters like
this so this one's called Sun in a
bottle it's a little more bronze II let
me swatch it for you I have a feeling
it's a doe foot but I have a feeling
this is going to be you know kind of
reminiscent especially this one of
high-beam from benefit this is morning
mist in a bottle that's definitely gonna
be the one I use today just skin tone
wise so what I'm gonna do is get a
little bit of the doe foot and just kind
of put the product on my hand like this
and then the way I like to do it you
could either take a little bit and tap
it into the area and then blend it in or
you could take your sponge and I tap it
and really kind of blend it into the
sponge and I just tap it where I want it
and by by kind of blending it on the
skin here first it eliminates that worry
of getting too much in one spot because
it's kind of already blended in you're
just putting like the extra leftover
bits on and it ends up looking really
natural and glowy oh my gosh I like this
it's certainly glowy but I think it I
like that it's not powdery I've really
gotten into this kind of a highlight
because it's not as obvious as like a
blush that's gonna stick in certain
areas like we just experienced so it's a
little bit more forgiving if you're new
to using cream liquid products there's
nothing to be scared of I just always
put it on my hand first because the
second I try to put some dots on my skin
it never ends up looking it doesn't I
mean you can do that and lots of people
do and it's fine but I just noticed it
looks a little more natural it's a
little bit more foolproof to put it on
my hand first blend it on there and then
kind of toss some on to that area now
this is not a new product but I just
want to use it this is my 8th Cosmetics
celebration foundation powder foundation
I like to grab a little bit of this and
just kind of blend it into the blush and
below I've been doing this a lot lately
so just give it a little bit more of a
seamless look it just kind of adds a
little bit of coverage and makes it look
just a little bit more
seamless and maybe it was before and
then I'll just put a little extra up on
my nose and forehead so the last step is
lips so I'm trying a couple new products
this is from essence they sent me all of
their soft contouring lip liners I
grabbed the one called big proposal this
is a pencil lip liner I have not used it
at all let's just see how how it goes I
don't know if it's like yeah it's
somewhat creamy it's like almost exactly
my lip shade so I just kind of truly did
a true lip line just on the out side of
my lips or the outer portion of my lips
so buxom has this new line of lip
products called their Vava plump and I
love the buxom like lip creams all of
them I love them so much so this is
their shiny liquid lipstick and I just
grabbed this shade this is filled of
passion the packaging is like black you
can kind of see the color through it
there's like little window so you can
actually see the color which i think is
awesome
you just watch a little bit of it yeah
it's definitely like a true color but it
does have a gloss to it so I'm wondering
will it dry down I kind of hope it
doesn't cuz I'm I mean we all talked
about how we're done with it we all are
huh I like the color it's a little bit
different than I pictured like looking
at it in here I'm like oh this will go
really good with that lip liner that's
why I paired them together but this is a
lot Pinker and once I look I don't know
all right I hate it with my I look like
a lot but it definitely got some on my
tooth it's definitely starting to get
that tingly feeling that like the buxom
plumping glosses have and of course this
is called Vava
plumps so I'm sure I need a tingle so if
you don't like that I would stay away
from this but it's a very like healthy
looking lip product like my lips look
really healthy do you guys see what I'm
saying I mean I feel like they look just
plumper come on Jess
but like I feel like you can't see the
lines in my lips as much as you can
other lip products which is a big deal
because I've got I just have really not
necessarily dry lips but just really
line II lips you know what I mean more
so I feel like than other people but it
feels really nice so I have other shades
I might mess with it maybe throw on a
different one for the other videos I'm
filming just cuz I don't think this
matches I thought it would be much
deeper and more of like a spicy color
anyway but formula wise I'm really
really enjoying it this is the final
look I feel like out of all of these
products let's kind of recap so my
favourites so far again thoughts can
change but so far my favourites are the
first day Beauty coconut priming
moisturizer really really liked that
this Catrice strobing blush I feel like
it went on really smoothly like it
didn't look patchy and I really liked
this shade mrs. amber brown I could
totally see myself using this a lot this
month so that was another favorite the
essence cushion liner I'm really really
enjoying I just need to get better at
the Catrice liquid camouflage concealer
I really really enjoyed the lip product
I'm enjoying and the mascara I like do I
think it's gonna be a favorite I don't
know only time will tell as I try it
some more some of my least favorites of
course would be the blush gelee I'm sure
there gonna be other people that
absolutely love this it's just it's just
not my cup of tea I don't have that kind
of time I really don't of course the
essence brighten up banana powder I just
thought made me look way older than I
really am the Rimmel foundations not a
bad bad product as I said but it's
certainly not a favorite of mine the
liner the lip liner from essence I don't
think these are bad but do I think like
you need to own every shade cuz it's an
amazing formula not necessarily I think
it's a pretty standard lip liner you
know it went on okay they have many
shades it's inexpensive so definitely
have that going for it the L'Oreal
infallible liners I think are nice I
think they're really nice I'm excited to
have some more drugstore options of
liners because I love my Milani one but
not everyone can get their hands on
Milani as easily as like maybe L'Oreal
so I do like that a lot
I like this essence make me glow little
product a lot so some kind of mad
products the profusion mixed metals
peach meth it's alright I think I like
the look in the end but it's just all
right the neutralizing powder from
Catrice kind of men as well you know
kind of a mixed bag of things but I love
doing these kinds of videos if you do
enjoy these please let me know by giving
it a thumbs up but other than that I
hope you'll subscribe before you leave
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
