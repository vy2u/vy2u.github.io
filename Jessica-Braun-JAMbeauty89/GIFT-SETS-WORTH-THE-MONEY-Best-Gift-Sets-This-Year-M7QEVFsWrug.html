gonna bring you my top 15 gift sets
value kits those kinds of little sets
that you can buy most of these honestly
I think you can find year-round but a
lot of them are here and around for the
holidays so I will link every set that I
mentioned below I think five of these
are from Ulta and ten of them are from
Sephora they range in price some of them
are under $10 some of them are over $40
so they're I'm gonna do my five from
Ulta first because I really they have a
lot of different stuff but these were
really the only the the only five that
really stood out to me out of all of
their pages and pages of value kits and
gift sets and then I've got ten from
Sephora so if you enjoy this kind of
video I hope you'll subscribe before you
leave hit that notification bell so
you're notified when I upload new videos
right away and let's go and get into it
so the first one I want to mention is
from Clinique this is their party pop
set and it is $12 so it comes with two
of their mini little lip what do they
actually call them lip color and primer
I have tried one of these in store and
it's been in my cart and like the shade
I wanted was sold out for a while so I'm
dying to try this line because when I
try to in store and I the only reason I
my attention was brought to it is
because the person working it also is
wearing it and I was like what are you
wearing on your lip she's like let me
show you and I was like holy yes because
it's a primer and lip color in one but
it just looked so like plump and it was
still like matte but it looked so good
on her lips I was like reeling I was
like I need this lip color so I think
I'm I personally I'm going to buy this
one it's in my like hearts or my
favorites on ulties website because I
think for twelve dollars six dollars
each you know they are smaller but the
formula is what really was like oh my
gosh I've not ever tried a lip color
like this so I think that's a really
good deal even though they're miniature
and the colors that come with it are
cherry pop and plum pop so it looks like
there's a nice bright red and then
there's the kind of a more pinkish
purplish light colored one too so I'm
totally totally I would totally
recommend that set the next one is the
soap &amp;amp; Glory happy pamper gift set this
is only seven dollars it comes with
their righteous butter like body butter
and it comes with their clean on me body
wash I've tried both I really like both
and think they
mell good the body butter super
moisturizing the body wash you know is a
body wash but I like the smell of it I
think they are more small like
travel-size but for seven bucks if
you've never tried these it's a great
time to try them but if you know you
already like them or you travel a lot
and you'd need this size as well that'd
be another good reason to buy it again
this is something I'm thinking about
buying for myself just because I do
travel a lot and this is these are two
products that I genuinely really like
seven bucks I mean that's like 350 each
I don't think that's too too crazy the
next one's from Too Faced and I'm gonna
recommend this one with a kind of caveat
so it's there undle a new I wouldn't go
sit under the Kisel toe I wanted to say
undal the kisser toe that sounds very
bizarre under the Kisel towel a little
set and so it's got four small size like
deluxe size of a bunch of their lip
products so as to it has one of their
melted lip colors it has their melted
chocolate it has a melted latex in a
melted map the reason I say I'm gonna
recommend this with the caveat is that I
do think that the melted mats are kind
of drying I mean if you don't mind that
I mean there are people that love it so
it's not my opinion is not the be-all
end-all we all have different likes when
it comes to especially like lip products
what you like on your lips so the melted
matte is truly matte it dries down it
gets really dry in the center of course
I'm saying that and I'm sure like my lip
color right now looks crazy but I do
like their melted lip colors I think
they're comfortable they don't totally
dry down but they're kind of more of a
whipped feel to them and I do really
like that and I've not tried their
melted latex so I do think it's a good
set if you look at the colors that you
know the range it's got that pink and
kind of that brown that peach and then
that like really vampy color which i
think is fun that it's kind of varied so
I think that 25 bucks for that is a
really good deal whether you've tried
them or not I think it's a good deal the
next one is the Ulta try me the seasons
most coveted makeup sampler and it is
$29 I was kind of impressed with all
that this came with so comes with the
bare minerals lipstick which their
lipsticks are usually very very
comfortable I've tried I think all of
their ranges all of them have been very
comfortable to wear and then it
like a Lancome lash primer I've not
tried this particular one but if you
like the kind of white fiber II kind of
thing I think you'd like it it comes
with one of the Becca highlighters which
are amazing and the reality is this is
the smaller size you're not ever gonna
use up if you are watching makeup videos
you probably have more than one
highlighter it takes a long time to use
one up so even though this is the deluxe
size I think it's still I mean that's
amazing
so and that is in the shade opal by the
way which i think is absolutely stunning
if you've not seen it let me just show
you I have the full size but it's
shattered everywhere and I repressed it
which I did successfully repress it with
alcohol there's tons of videos on
YouTube if you look it up if you have no
idea what I'm talking about this is such
a pretty highlighter I do think it lost
a little of its luster when I repressed
it I might just be in my head but I feel
like it was a lot more lustrous than
this but it is a gorgeous gorgeous
highlighter totally worth the hype
behind it anyway um so you also get a
buxom full-on lip polish in dolly it has
this tingle to it I look I might have I
think that ones in my purse I have that
exact shade I love the buxom lip polish
they're tingly if you don't like that
you won't like it they kind of plump
your lips a little bit or at least it
feels like it does and it's just a nice
neutral color that just looks nice on
its own and I highly recommend that also
comes with the it cosmetics brow power
Universal brow pencil which you can use
for any brow the harder you press the
darker it is I've had that I like it
I'm not crazy picky with brows but that
was one I didn't love love not because
the I just felt like I couldn't get the
right color but it's not a bad brow
product it also comes with the Lancome
SILS booster mascara it comes with the
lorac mini tantalizer bronzer and what
else Tarte man-eater mascara oh I didn't
know this came with this what did I miss
here
oh my favorite the Stila stay all day
liquid liner is my favorite well it's
one of my favorite liquid liners but it
also sets a $5 gift card towards any
full-size item featured in this box that
is smart that is really cool so 29 bucks
it's kind of like you're getting it for
24 since you're getting the gift card
toward a full-size of one of those
that's awesome
that is absolutely awesome so I totally
recommend that
right so the next one is the tart
goddess essentials color collection this
is amazing and I had to look it up to
make sure I wasn't crazy this is two of
their full-size products for $30 and a
deluxe size mascara now the mascara is
okay it's they're like lights cameras
lashes some people love it some people
don't but I'm really recommending it
even if that weren't even in it because
that means you're getting the full size
Tarte blush and exposed which is like
their best-selling I love that shade
it's such a natural pink for $15 and
then you're getting their full-sized
Park Avenue princess bronzer for $15
that's amazing because both of those
separately are like 26 $30 so that's a
stellar deal they say it's a $68 value I
fully believe that now I'm just thinking
about getting this because I no longer
have the Tarte blush nor do I have the
bronzer so I'm like maybe it's already
in my like favorites there too that's an
awesome deal that is a fantastic deal so
those are all my Ulta ones let's go to
my Sephora ones the first one this one
I'm kind of counting as one together I
have recently fall in love with keels
and I hate that because their products
can be really expensive but I've quickly
learned that the only way to buy Kiehl's
products is in make these little gift
sets so the first one I saw that caught
my eye is their dry relief duo it's $16
they say it's an $18 value and that's
why I almost didn't recommend it because
there's lip balm is the balm I have
discovered so many good lip balms lately
but this is another one this is what I
keep in my nightstand and I put on every
single night it's such a good lip balm
apparently they've used the same formula
since like forever I don't know it set
it on the little bottle but of course it
doesn't say here but it also comes with
like a travel size of their creme de
coeur body lotion which is amazing it's
been relieving my dry skin on my legs
which is not just dry skin but like
itchy dry skin it's so amazing so
luxurious I have the full size and it's
expensive so now I'm like well now I'm
gonna want it when I travel so this is
something I'm thinking about buying but
the other one that's kind of in tandem
with this is their Disney and heels
hydration essential it's $29 and you get
the same creme de coeur thing you get
the same lip balm but you also get their
ultra facial cleanser you get their
ultimate strength hand salv which i've
heard amazing things and their ultra
facial cream
which I have used only in trial size and
its really really moisturizing so the
only thing Disney about it and I was
like really is the box and so I was like
it's a really cool box but I'm like I
don't need a box you know but for 29
bucks
it says $36 value in my opinion it's
gotta be more than that because that's
like the full-size lip balm as far as I
can tell and then everything I mean
anyway so I think that's an awesome
value I totally recommend okay I got to
keep going cuz this video is gonna be
for everyone you have this uh gold
Beauty Blender gold mine and it is
limited edition and I think if you've
got the money I would recommend this one
more because it comes with two
full-sized Beauty blenders for 40 bucks
which that is what it would cost but you
also get the full-sized solid cleanser
and you get the blotter Otzi now I've
not tried the bladder Otzi but I figure
you know what even if it didn't have
that you're getting two Beauty blenders
for the regular price $40 you're
basically getting a free cleanser and
you're getting the bladder ROTC for free
so if you know you're gonna buy Beauty
blenders anyway or you want to have more
than one this has the pink and the nude
which I do have the nude one now and I
do like it because it doesn't show the
foundation as much so if it's dirty you
can't tell that could be a blessing and
a curse but um so I do think that's a
really good deep next one is this Oh
Lula Henrickson Olay Hendriks every I
never say it right anyway it's their
three little wonders mini set it's $25
$39 value the reason I recommend this is
because it has that truth serum this is
something that I have tried recently in
tiny form and this has I think it's
still a smaller form but it's not their
teeny tiny maybe it is but if you've
been wanting to try that it also has
their invigorating night transformation
gel and their sheer transformation
perfecting moisturizer all of these are
highly radiant all of these are like
highly recommended by people that know a
lot about skincare which is not me I'm
learning this is something I'm pretty
sure I'm gonna buy this holiday season
for myself because I really want to try
all of those and I remember trying the
truths to you a long long time ago and I
remember liking it but once I ran out I
was like well I'm not gonna it's too
expensive I'm not gonna buy it again but
I'm like okay for $25 I could try all
three of them get a feel for if I do
want to buy the full size so I think
that's an awesome deal okay this is
something I'm wearing this is the
colour-pop feeling fine lip gloss trio
18 bucks so you're getting each for six
dollars now Browdy is the color pop the
lip glosses aren't that expensive to
begin with but really I just like all of
these colors so the one I'm wearing on
my lips today is called fairy me and
that's one of the three these are high
shine glitter lip glosses but I think
they're comfortable I love the packaging
which I know sounds dumb but at the
holidays you kind of just want like
glitzy glamour e packaging this is what
I'm wearing now I do have it on top of
like a bold red I can show you I put it
on top of the maybelline superstay matte
ink in Pioneer which I can also link
below I love this stuff I love that
whole line but it just added this really
nice shimmer and made it look more berry
like and I just like it I think they're
really comfortable the whole set is
really pretty and that's why I would
recommend it I think it'd be a really
beautiful gift that for eighteen dollars
looks more expensive than it really is
but um I really like them and especially
as we're moving away from more matte
colors I think that's an awesome way to
add three really shiny beautiful lip
glosses to your collection next one this
is a personal favorite the this is the
cinema secrets makeup brush cleaner pro
starter kit so you get an eight ounce of
the brush cleanser best brush cleanser
I've ever used it works in seconds it
dries so fast it is like the strongest
brush cleanser there's a reason like
makeup artists use it because it's so
quick but it also comes with the tin
which I do use because what I do is I
pour the brush cleanser in it and then
my brushes I just dip in there really
quickly clean them put to the side to
dry and it makes brush cleaning so fast
so the tin you buy it once and you have
forever I mean you can clean it out it's
not going anywhere the brush cleanser I
have like the giant one of because I
fell in love with it but it sold out all
the time
so I think this is 24 bucks for this it
says $30 value I think it's worth it
because you get the tin with it and I
might buy it well but see I don't need
the tin but the other ones always sold
out anyway totally recommend this exilim
is an expensive one and I did buy this
my
during the vib sale it's the Clarisonic
flawless finish essentials now I only
recommend this if you already have a
Clarisonic if you don't look at the
other Clarisonic kits they have I know
because you need the actual thing to be
able to hold these but if you are a
Clarisonic junkie and you know you're
gonna end up buying refills anyway like
for the heads then buy this because you
are gonna save money now if you are not
this won't make sense for you because if
you don't know that you're going to buy
a bunch of refills for it then don't
spend the money why I like this is
because it also has a foundation brush
head the foundation brush fits on any
Clarisonic model I've double checked the
hat on I have three of them I'm like
embarrassed to say that it kind of just
happened I think I bought one and then
one was sent to me and well most
recently and I'm very very thankful for
that because I do use them in my
bathroom I use them now with the
foundation here I can show it to you so
this is the foundation brush head so it
comes with this and it comes with three
of the regular cleansing refills so 485
bucks
it's a 116 dollar value stellar if you
know you're gonna use them if you don't
it might not be worth the money but I
wanted to mention it the other one that
I personally bought is this Sunday Riley
flash fix kit I was tired of hearing
about Sunday Riley is so good but it's
so expensive and I'm like I want to try
the good genes lactic acid treatments so
bad but it's so expensive so this was
the cheapest way I found that I could
try it
so it's $28 you get the good genes a
really small size which is an H a
exfoliator it's been doing some
wonderful things for my skin I had had
so many hormonal breakouts and I feel
like it helped with that it helped but
kind of revive my skin get rid of some
of the redness just kind of increased
that turnover and I'm really liking it
which scares me because that means I
might want to buy a more expensive you
know like the big size of it and I
anyway it also comes with the ceramic
slip clay cleanser which I've been using
the past week I really like that too it
does feel actually really nice when you
use it now would I buy the full size of
that I don't know it's not nearly as
expensive as
good genes I will say that but I think
for 28 bucks that's in a great kit to
try those out and I never want to run
out all right the last one that is this
sephora favorites give me more lip set
so it's $68 which I know is like oh my
gosh
but it's 250 for dollar value so if
you're shopping for someone that loves
lip products or you yourself love lip
products it has 5 full-size and then 10
deluxe eyes so that is a big selling
point for it and I know a lot of people
are like I'm not paying $68 for a ton of
tiny lip products but at least it does
have 5 full-size which i think is really
cool so I hope this was fun to watch
whether it helped you think about
products ok hair I see that you're there
figure out where you want to go um
hopefully this helped you figure out
some products that you're either wanting
to buy for yourself or someone else
maybe a Beauty lover in your life I just
think these are all so great I mean
they're great stocking stuffers they're
great gifts they're great you know ways
to stock up on things maybe you already
love or maybe you need travel sizes of
things whatever the reasoning might be I
love watching these kinds of videos I
don't know why a lot of times I watch
them and I don't buy anything I just
like watching them I'm just weird like
that but if you did enjoy I hope you'll
subscribe and give this video a thumbs
up if you like this format and I'll see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
