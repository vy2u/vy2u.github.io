a haul and these are all glossier
products so some of them I use today so
I'll insert some close-ups and things of
what these look like on my skin and
let's go and get into it so I previously
bought some things from glossier and I
did a video I can link it below a lot of
their skincare but this time when I was
placing the order I focused a lot more
on their makeup because I've heard I've
heard I've heard some good things about
them but I also got a couple more
skincare items but I wanted to try so if
I don't mention something that you're
curious about in this video check out
the other one because I probably
mentioned it in that I pretty much
bought everything blog a sell no joke I
mean honestly I think I literally bought
one of everything they sell so check
that video if I don't mention it today
of course I will have links for all the
products I mentioned today down below as
well if you are interested let's start
with their most famous product this is
the glossy a boy brow I bought it in the
shade brown and it's just this tiny
spoolie and you just brush it through
your brows I'll insert right now a
little clip of me with it in my brows I
do I was pretty impressed I thought
there's no way like remember the benefit
gimme brow I say remember it's still
around let's the benefit gimme brow I
really just didn't like and I think it
was because I never could be precise
with it and I feel the same way about
this I really feel like they're pretty
much the exact same product maybe this
is a little bit better I was impressed
in that it fills them out a lot more
than I thought it would but I had to
keep cleaning the edges because the like
kind of colored gel and I'll show you it
truly is you know a colored product it
would get all over the skin so I clean
it up or like wear my brows are
naturally thinner it wouldn't fill it
out as much as I wanted so I felt like I
still had sparse areas to fill in so I
went back through and I'm not really
totally happy with the way my brows was
today but I filled an image at the
drugstore I think it was like a L'Oreal
little brow pencil I filled it in the
rest of the way because I really wasn't
satisfied now if I were in a hurry
let's see even then I feel like since I
can't be precise it almost takes me
longer because I'm cleaning up the edge
but if you've got really thick brows and
they don't really need a lot of shaping
or filling in this would be perfect cuz
it'll darken them kind of shape them
enough and then you can go but if you're
like me and you do darken your brows a
little bit and you need to fill them in
a little bit I don't think you'll like
this as much as other people do that's
my honest opinion the next product I was
so pleasantly surprised by this is the
glossy a perfecting skin tint now they
don't have a lot of shades I have it in
light so the thing about this is it's
not a crazy full coverage foundation I'm
wearing it today you can probably see
some of my imperfections but I applied
it with a Beauty Blender which you know
it soaks up a lot of this this is a very
liquidy squeezie too I'll show you very
liquid foundation very very liquid it
made my skin look so naturally beautiful
like it was kind of glowy not crazy
glowy but just glowy enough and I'll
insert a clip here so you can see it you
can still see my imperfections as I said
but I feel like for everyday it looked
so much healthier than when I'm taking
on other foundations that they probably
still don't cover as well but they make
my skin look dull or dry this made my
skin look so healthy
like it was kind of crazy so I thought I
was prepared to maybe not be impressed
and I was so impressed and like I said I
find it actually is my L'Oreal beauty
sponge which is like my favorite right
now over the Beauty Blender over
anything I am it obsessed with it I use
it everyday but it just it covered
enough it was very healthy looking and I
think it applied really well with the
Beauty Blender I think if you just
rubbed it in I mean it's like a tinted
moisturizer but prettier the next
product that I tried today is the
concealer it's their stretch concealer
comes in a little pop it didn't cover as
much I ended up going in with like a
concealing mineral powder because I just
felt like I needed more especially for
me today filming now for everyday it was
comfortable it really didn't hide my
dark circles it definitely sunk into
fine lines I just felt like this is one
of those things that you can find a
better one
the drugstore if you're dying to try it
I mean like I said it's a very amoliant
all moisturizing feel to it so if you
are really dry there you actually might
really like it but it's so amoliant that
it does think into those fine lines very
heavily it doesn't cover very well so it
kind of depends on what you need if
you're a lot younger and you really want
have a lot to cover but you still wanna
use concealer it would probably be
beautiful on your skin but if you have
mature skin it really would depend but
like I said it really sinks into those
fine lines like more than any concealer
I've ever tried does that mean I'm never
going to use it I think I'll still use
it because like I said it's moisturizing
it kind of feels good on your skin it
just doesn't look as good next thing I
tried was this glossy a cloud paint the
names of their products are so cute they
make you want to try them and if you
guys have seen I was dying and I if I
can find the video I'll link it but
suave did this campaign where they show
is this commercial where they had a
bunch of people try this new expensive
hair care buy eval which is swap spelled
backwards so they're trying in the
packaging honestly looks like glossy
packaging like white was like pink very
trendy very much what a lot of us are
drawn into and so they tried not yeah
this is so amazing my hair is never
looked better and then of course at the
end they reveal will actually the suave
you idiots know me guys leave a swab in
there like Wonder Woman is crazy and I
loved it because it's so true we all get
so sucked into the how cute the
packaging is I am totally guilty of that
and I don't know that there's a remedy
other than just knowing that but that's
why I was excited to do this video
because I want to be able to debunk and
let you guys know okay yes the packaging
for all of glossiest products are so
cute but what's actually doing was
actually not so so far was they to
concealer and the foundation yes boy
brow it just depends on what you like so
this next one is all over the place
right now it's their cloud paint I got
it in the shade dusk this is a creamy
blush I'm sure you could wear it other
ways it's very creamy it's a really
pretty color I'm wearing it today I
don't think it's most super obvious
thing in the world what I did is I
this on my hand like this I took just a
little elf stipple brush and I Sibbald
it onto my cheeks then you know it's
kind of punchy the first time you put it
on so then I took my sponge my L'Oreal
plunge that had a little bit of the
foundation and I kind of cleaned it up
on top of it just to kind of meld it
into the rest of my skin it looks so
natural and healthy I thought about
going back in today and putting on more
blush to make it look more you know I've
got all these lights on and stuff but I
thought no because I loved the way like
if you could see me in person I could
ever capture that on film it never
happens but it's so beautiful and
healthy and with this foundation I was
looking at myself in the mirror and like
gosh like feel okay I look like a normal
human being it doesn't look like I've
got tons of makeup on my face but I feel
like my skin looks healthy and glowing
and I haven't felt this way about
products in a long time of course they
have other shades I might if I place
another order at some point in future I
would probably try another shade too
just because I really liked this one but
I want maybe like more of a pink one as
well
the next thing another famous product of
theirs is their halo halo scope I don't
know why I struggle to say that it's in
the shade quartz I'm wearing this today
as well and again I thought about
putting on like another eye liner I
thought no like I love how healthy this
looked so it has this little core that
is a little bit lighter than the outer
ring but it's just a cream highlight
stick it's so natural but not natural
but it's so beautiful it reminds me of
my RMS beauty living Luminizer or my
master mixer where it's in a pot and you
put it on it's like a stick version of
that if you mix master mixer and living
room and eyes are all in one you get
this one anyway but I love it because it
looks so natural and it looks like your
skin is glowing from within it's it's
not even necessarily shimmery or
glittery it's just glowy and it's so
amazing and I'm not big on stick
highlights so the way that I applied
this was I actually did straight-up go
put a strip on and then I grabbed my
L'Oreal sponge and I just blended it in
that way
and I also tried just dotting it on so
there wasn't as much and blending that
in as well either way works so if you're
intimidate
by these to use your beauty sponge and
you can don't feel intimidated on and
blend it in and it blends in so
seamlessly so it doesn't end up looking
in my opinion like a strip as long as
you blend it that way of course you can
also dip your finger in it dotted on
that way there's a million ways to apply
it but if you've been intimidated by
this kind of a product don't be just use
as much I'm moving on to my bomb calm so
I had tried there balm calm it's a lip
balm very much like petroleum jelly
there's no scent lasts forever they are
marketing it not necessarily just as a
lit mall but it's a skin sound you can
put on your cuticles your elbows
anything that's dry and in that way I
really do feel like it's just petroleum
jelly in a thing the first ingredient is
petroleum and then they have other stuff
so you know just keep that in mind
however now I own two of those I have
one at work and then now I have one here
but then I got some of the flavored one
I should have just started with the
flavored ones because these are so much
better
the original is good if you're going to
put it on like your cuticles and stuff I
would say use the original but if you're
genuinely wanting it just for a lip balm
I recommend the flavor so the mint one I
put it back in the box I don't know why
because I've been using home its first
of all the packaging
I know it's but it's so cute it's got
the mint and a light blue lid and it's
the same formula but it's minting it
does kind of give that tingle not too
much but if you like just a little bit
of minty tingle you will love this and I
could be honest love that and it smells
like mint chocolate chip cookies mint
chocolate chip ice cream not cookies I
guess whatever so highly recommend this
now the coconut one I've only smelled I
haven't actually worn I love coconut
let's smell it again okay so the light
peach packaging and then the darker like
tangerine colored lid these are so good
they're very thick for me so if you
don't like thick like I said like
petroleum jelly you won't like this oh
my gosh okay it smells like coconut but
I have to say there's like this weird
hint of like buttered popcorn smell and
when you get if you get this and smell
it you're going to know exactly where I
mean it smells by coconut but it also
kind of smells
you know the Jelly Belly's they have the
buttered popcorn flavor it's really
weird it has that smell too so I would
say out of all of them I recommend the
mint but the coconut is nice
they're just so nice now do I think it
that these peel your lips that they're
chapped not necessarily and that's why I
keep saying it really is like petroleum
jelly because I don't I feel like it
protects your lips but it's not
necessarily healing them now the mint
one feels like it's doing more I've only
been using it for a week so I don't know
genuinely if it is but I will say the
original I really don't feel that it's
healing checklist it's just protecting
them which really is what most lip balms
do for you anyway your lips naturally
you know regenerate all the time so it's
kind of a natural cycle sometimes for
your lips to be chapped and then but if
your lips are genuinely really trapped
chapped maybe you're sick or they wonder
I don't think this is necessarily the
product for you all right
so oh my gosh I'm going to do the
skincare at the end one thing well this
is kind of in the middle it's kind of
skincare but I do have some lip products
so this is the glossy a soothing face
myth it's there rose water spray it just
says you use any time to refresh your
skin got water rose water glycerin okay
a couple other things so let's see how
the sprayers
oh it definitely smells like rose the
sprayer seems alright you know if you
hold it part of why I don't want to
spray my face right now because I don't
know how much it's going to change what
I already put on my face but it smells
really nice it definitely has that rosy
smell so I'm excited to give this a try
this is one of those things that I think
especially like in the winter when
you're just like gosh your skin is kind
of parched and nothing looks good on
your dry skin if you're like me this
might be the nicest thing to just spray
everywhere and ah I didn't throw this in
my gym bag although really my face does
not need any more moisture at the gym
anyway so I'm excited to try this I
really don't know yet how I feel so this
I'll have to update you on all right so
a lip gloss I bought is there glossy a
lip gloss and clear it's just straight
up clear why do I buy a clear
so it looks like it's got this like
light pink tint to it even though it's
clear the doe foot is like one of those
flattened Delft what's my favorite those
are my absolute favorite
it just I mean it's just a clear gloss
but I'm liking putting these kinds of
glosses on top of lipsticks lately I'm
just so out of the matte craze right now
and I just feel like I'm digging lip
globs right now especially spring and
summer I'm just into it but you see to
feel it so it feels a little bit sticky
maybe not too sticky but yeah it does
feel sticky okay next is the generation
G generation G a lip gloss a sheer matte
lipstick I bought it in the shade tape
and it's just got plain white packaging
with their logo and it's just a little
really simple little roll-up and it's
definitely sheer definitely Matt's a
pretty color though very it's just
simple and like I said it is sheer but
it's matte but almost in a satin way
where you think it actually might be
comfortable it's not like a thick matte
lipstick putting on so this again is
going to be that perfect spring and
summer lip color where you're not
fussing with it you're not worried about
it when you're out and about but it just
looks nice and it makes your lips look
healthy and flush so I got a couple more
skincare items I bought their
moisturizing moon mask
it's a soothing face treatment says
apply a thick layer to moist skin allow
to soak in for 20 minutes I love sheet
masks I genuinely love sheet masks but
sometimes I don't want to fuss with
having to keep it on my face whether I'm
getting a bath or working out you know
whatever is so sometimes I like just the
straight-up masks that I can just
slather on I have a little elf mask
application tool so I dip that that one
is my fingers every time I'll get that
in and spread it out so this one is
meant to be soothing the other one I
bought is the mega green's galaxy pack
detoxifying face mask and it's the same
thing you'll let it this one dries after
20 minutes this one since it's more
soothing I think it just soaks in so I'm
excited to give this a try this one's
more of a white text you know white
creamy texture this
more of a thick texture so the last
product I bought this time around was
their set of serums this is called
they're the supers set and it's their
three serums I've already tried one and
I would really really love it and I have
their super bounce already so I'm going
to save this one for when I run out but
these serums are expensive and I'm
trying out a bunch of products from the
skincare brand the ordinary and they are
really really inexpensive they're known
for selling pure ingredients for really
really cheap and so as I'm trying I
ordered a lot from them as I'm trying
those out I'm trying to compare them to
the more expensive serums because I'd
love to be able to do a review of the
ordinary a really thorough one I'm still
trying a lot of them out because there's
a lot too and I want to see how it
affects my skin so since I want that to
be a very informed review I'm taking my
time but I'm wanting to compare it to
these more expensive serums and say you
know do you need to buy these because
the station if you can get basically the
same thing for like a fourth of the
price why would you not you know of
course they have the cute packaging
though but I really I love this super
elf serum I've been using it everyday
that's ironic acid vitamin b5 it it
genuinely is amazing these I have not
tried though this is the super glow and
it's vitamin C and magnesium so it's
supposed to of course if you're seeing a
little bit more glowy this is a really
thin serum very very thin the other
one's more of like a true serum so I'm
excited to give this a try this might be
one I maybe put on in the morning
because I do currently use my totally
one that I love and then I also got the
super pure and it says it's to calm
breakout prone skin so this one has
within it again this is a really thin
one as well but it's got nice and amide
and zinc now I know that there's a
niacinamide in zinc serum because I have
it from the ordinariness way cheaper so
I don't necessarily have breakout prone
skin so I'm not the best resource for
that if you do have that however you
know I do get breakouts from time to
time and so I have used that niacinamide
serum and I do feel like it's calmed
down like all breakout here from time to
time and I do feel like it's helped a
lot so it's an awesome
that it's really expensive that I like
that you kind of get everything you
could possibly need for your skin you
know maybe more glowy maybe just the
treatment for moisture maybe more of a
clear and breakout so it's cool if you
want all three but it's really expensive
so hopefully this was helpful I know not
all of these I've tried yet but the ones
that I have I tried to you know give you
everything I know about them so far like
I said if there is a glossier product
you're curious about that I didn't
mention check out the other video I
probably mentioned it in that one and
other than that I hope that you will
subscribe and catch more of my videos
and I'll see you guys in my next one
