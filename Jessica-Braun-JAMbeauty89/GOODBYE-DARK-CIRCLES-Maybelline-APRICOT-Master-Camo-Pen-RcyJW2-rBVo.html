excited to try out a new product I went
out and bought this in a recent target
haul and if that video is live I like
chopped live and showed you guys what I
was buying and talked through kind of
why I was buying things and this was one
of those things that I bought and it is
the Maybelline master camo color
correcting pen I think is what they call
why can't I find my language there you
go nope color correcting pen yes so I
got it in the shade 50 which is apricot
so the idea of this is that it's
supposed to be for dark circles so I'm
on Mac's not ulties website and it
retails at Ulta for $9.99 I think I got
it for cheaper at Target you know shop
around or wait for a coupon from Ulta or
like a buy one get one 50% off something
like that but anyway they have other
colors and I'll show you on the screen
but they have green they have yellow
this F rakaat one they have red purple
and light pink so for the apricot one
it's meant for dark circles so they say
it's designed to fix targeted skintone
issues they have shades for different
skin tones which those are the shades I
just mentioned I presume the red would
be for dark circles but it's for deeper
skin tones so if you're more like me
you'd want apricot if you're a lot
deeper you'd go for the red now the idea
is this is not meant to be used alone to
cover the dark circles you're supposed
to use this in conjunction with
concealer and foundation the way that I
apply this and I'll show you me applying
it here in just a second I apply this
first I blended in with the Beauty
sponge then I applied concealer and
blend that in I had already had
foundation on now if you really really
wanted to conceal this you could do this
first then concealer then foundation it
really is up to you and your style of
doing makeup or what looks good on you
you might try it one way and then say
you know what let me try it this other
way tomorrow so that's your call I just
do it the way I do it and it works for
me so I've been using this for a little
while now and I wanted to show you how
I've been using it and then my thoughts
on if I think you should go out and buy
it
so the applicator has this sponge tip
that's an interesting shape it's kind of
almost like a teardrop shape and it
bends backwards and you twist the bottom
to get the formula up into the sponge
and so it's it's a soft sponge but it's
firm if that makes any sense
and this really truly is an orangish
peach apricot shade and so you know when
you put it on it's kind of alarming and
the very first time I put it on I was
like oh my gosh like it's so orange how
is this gonna work
but because it's got that color that's
what's really neutralizing those dark
circles on your inner eye or your under
eye I have really dark circles on my
inner eye and under eyes and I just
always have I think like even since I
was a kid it's just who I am and how I
how I was made anyway so let me show you
me applying this and I'll walk you
through so for me I apply it on my inner
corner and right near my kind of
under-eye and then I like to grab a
sponge today I'm using my pink L'Oreal
sponge which I can link below I really
really like it
I'm just using that it is wet which is
important and I'm using that to blend it
in now I will say this if you really
want it to pack a punch you don't have
to use a sponge you could just use your
finger or maybe a small brush to blend
it in I just like a sponge I've gotten
used to using it and it works pretty
well but I will say it definitely will
be more coverage if you don't use a
sponge so after that I'm gonna put on a
concealer and today I'm using the Milani
retouch an erase light lifting concealer
I will link this below if I can find
Milani is kind of hard to find online
but I love this one I have it in the
shade fair and so I'm applying in that
same area and I'm gonna blend it with
the other side of the same sponge and I
really feel like when you put the
concealer over it that's where you
really see like wow it really looks so
much better
it really looks brightened you can't see
as much of the dark circles for me this
is an added step when you're in a rush
in the morning for work the last thing
you're thinking about is putting on two
different concealers basically because
that's essentially what we're doing with
this so you kind of have to decide for
yourself like is it worth the extra step
are they bad enough that it's worth it
so for me I don't think like I'm not
embarrassed to go out with no makeup on
I don't think they're so bad that it's
like alarming does that make sense but I
do like you know if I'm filming but also
I've even done it for work I have done
it and I feel like it does make a
difference now could I put on a really
high coverage
and still make it look really good like
on its own without the master cam oh of
course but for every day I don't like
putting on heavy concealer because it
just ages me more than I want it to so I
like this because it doesn't add in more
age and if I'm using a concealer that I
know I already love and that doesn't
make me look older then I'm totally down
for this because I think together they
really do work well I tried it with
thicker concealers and it works just
fine I've tried it with thinner I mean
it really does work well with like I've
tried five different concealers with it
and they all work really well so the
other thing to think about is like they
have the green one which would cancel
out redness so if you have like a red
nose which I do but for me things break
apart on my nose a lot and so I don't
know that I want to put that there and
put I don't like putting green on my
nose just because if the foundation
above it starts to break apart
I don't want green to be showing through
like to me that's worse but for this I'm
never really worried about it because
while it is a totally different shade
than my skin tone I don't think that's
ever gonna happen because of the way we
blended it in and because this area
doesn't really break up on me very much
so my final verdict on this is I think
it is actually really good like I said I
haven't tried the other shades to know
how it would wear on different parts of
your face if you have please let us know
below that way if someone is watching
this and they're considering trying out
maybe the green one or the purple let's
talk about these so the yellow I'm just
realizing I didn't talk about the other
ones yellow it's created to brighten
dullness which you know I don't know if
you have Dole maybe areas of your skin
the purple they say is to neutralize
sallowness so maybe if you've got a
yellowish area you don't want to be here
you just feel you've got that sallow
pallor I just like saying that and then
the pink is to brighten dullness for
light skin tones so the yellow is for
dullness for light to medium so you know
yourself you know what would work for
you but I definitely think it's worth
trying I really liked this one and I
think I like this better than like you
know I have other salmon concealers like
the erase paste from benefit or you know
all those different kinds and well I
really love those like the Bobbi Brown
one I really like it's expensive
this is still different though than
those because with those I can do that
and I don't have to put another
concealer over it whereas with this you
really do have to but I think I like the
finish look of this better than I do
with the other stuff does that make
sense so that's my final verdict I think
it is totally awesome I put my GM Beauty
89 stamp of approval on it at least on
this shade so like I said let us know
below if you've tried some other ones if
you enjoyed this style of video
definitely give it a thumbs up I hope
that you will subscribe to catch more of
my videos and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
