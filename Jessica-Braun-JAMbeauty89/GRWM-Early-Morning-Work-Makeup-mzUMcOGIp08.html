a get ready with me video for you today
I'm gonna be doing what I do when it's
early in the morning and I'm headed to
work for the day I know a lot of you
guys have very similar mornings to me
where some mornings you wake up and you
have tons of time okay that's very rare
but some of most mornings we all look
tired right so regardless of how much
time you have to get ready our skin
looks tired our eyes look tired I mean
our skin could be dry so there's all of
those different early morning problems
we have getting ready early in the
morning am i right so today I've pulled
together a bunch of products that I like
to use most mornings so I'm getting
ready for work so let's go and get into
it so I'm gonna start by pulling my mane
of hair back with this I got like a pack
of like five at the Dollar Tree and
they're perfect cuz I can just throw
them in the wash but they kind of hold
my hair back while I'm getting ready but
I don't worry about them getting dirty
anyway so they're awesome so if you're
in need of something to hold your hair
back the dollar trees got it okay so
we're gonna start with the origins
original skin moisturizer origins is
actually sponsoring this video and this
was something new to me it's one of
their new products and it's a matte
moisturizer and so it's this pink water
cream formula kind of gel like when you
feel it but it's I've been using it if
you've watched my snapchat I've been
using this a ton lately because I can
use it and use only this and it takes
care of moisturizing my skin but it's
also like a primer so I don't typically
use the primer when I'm using this
because it fills in my pores it kind of
helps fix the tone of my skin and little
bits of redness but it also like holds
on to my makeup all day so it's kind of
one of those things that I'm like it's
such a time saver it smells really nice
and it's just one of those products
that's it's got so many things going for
it all in one that when origins reached
out to me and where they were letting me
try it for a while I was like oh my gosh
this stuff is amazing so like I said if
you see my snapchat I've talked about it
a couple of mornings because I can't
stop using it to me it's a really
innovative product so I really like it
it's kind of been a lifesaver for me
especially early in the morning when I'm
getting ready and my skin just needs
that boost of hydration but I also need
it to be ready for makeup and I
to be quick so this is awesome I'll have
a link for this down in the subscription
box it's available at Sephora now and
it's one of those things that I'm not
gonna run out of this anytime soon thank
goodness because I have been using it
like every single morning okay so now
that my moisturizer and primer and one
is done I'm going to use the number
seven lift and luminate foundation
I'm gonna use my L'Oreal pink sponge
that I really really like to apply it
and honestly this is just such a quick
step it's a comfortable foundation it
makes sure that you can still see the
moisturizer underneath it in a good way
like I feel like my skin just looks
healthy when I put it on and it's really
easy to blend in it doesn't take a super
long time now this is not a super high
coverage foundation but for me it gives
enough coverage I would say maybe medium
coverage I only need like one coat of it
and it's just healthy and it makes your
skin look they're healthy throughout the
day as well and I really loved pairing
this with that origins moisturizer so
for me when it's early in the morning I
need to get rid of some dark circles so
I used my Bobbi Brown corrector in light
bisque they have a ton of different
shades but I love it because again it's
easy to blend in but it really does
cover dark circles really well and so
for me it's a quick step but it's kind
of an essential step I'm also going to
throw on some of the Revlon youth FX
fill and blur concealer this is a newer
product to me but it does a really great
job of brightening this area because
again you know late at night I like to
put a little bit on my nose since my
nose does tend to be red and that
foundation is not super high coverage
but I just find that it it blends in
easily it does sink into fine lines a
bit so it's not like totally foolproof
although like I've said many times I've
never found a concealer that doesn't
sink into fine lines but it's just
brightening and again your skin looks
healthy underneath it and I feel like it
helps me look a lot more awake so I'm
gonna do my brows next this is my pretty
vulgar eyebrow pencil it's in the shade
quick wit and it's got the I'm kind of
triangular shaped waxy brow pencil and
then a spoolie so I like to brush my
brows out really quickly in the morning
and then go in for it
alright I'm gonna do the rest of my face
here in just a second but I like to do
my eyes at this point I've been kind of
adjusting my order
hmmm my order of doing things so I'm
gonna use the Milani eyeshadow primer
great one from the drugstore around 5
ish dollars it might be a little bit
more expensive than that but I will link
all of the products I mentioned down
below but this stuff just does a great
job of holding on to your shadow it
cancels out a little bit of
discoloration but not a ton but I'm
really not using it for that I'm using
it just to lock in the shadow for the
whole day so I'm gonna use my good old
fashioned Too Faced chocolate bar
palette I pulled this out the other day
and I was like oh my gosh I forgot how
much I love this it has every color I
could ever need
of course it smells like chocolate as
well this is an investment palette it's
like 40 or 50 dollars but it's one of
those things that for me it's one of my
all-time favorite palettes I've ever
purchased because it really does have
every color I could ever need the only
thing I would add would maybe be a matte
black but I'm gonna use the white
chocolate shade which is like this matte
beige shade and just kind of set the
primer really quickly this is a step I
never skip even if I'm really in a hurry
because it if you put the shadow right
on the primer it ends up sticking in
weird spots and it just drives me crazy
so this is almost like I mean it it's
like setting it with the powder so on
most workdays I go in with some kind of
light medium brown this is salted nope
yeah this is salted caramel caramel
whatever you wanna call it so I'm just
kind of sticking it right in the crease
here nice warm Brown it's amazing that
takes so you know 30 seconds but it
already feels more complete so the other
thing I typically do is I'll grab maybe
a smaller crease brush and maybe a
deeper shade so today let's go for I'm
gonna go for this semi-sweet shade which
is kind of a deeper Brown and just kind
of focus it really in the crease and in
the outer corner area now I'm going to
take my favorite shade marzipan
which is this gorgeous kind of champagne
shade just with my finger apply it to
the lid
this shade is just so pretty you could
totally wear it alone on your lid for
like a really kind of do a glossy look
on your eye like if you put it all the
way under the crease if you wanted it's
just such a pretty shaggy oh my gosh and
then I like to take more of white
chocolate with a really flat almost like
concealer brush and just apply that
right under my brow bone and then one
last blend and then I'm gonna take that
same semi-sweet darker shade and just
throw a little on the outer lower lash
line just to kind of define that area a
bit so that's it for the eye look we'll
throw on a little bit of liner this is
the Rimmel scandaleyes Kajal like Kohl
Kajal liner so you do have to sharpen it
but I'm just gonna tight line a little
bit with it and then I like to take a
small brush and kind of blend that
together with that kind of smudging it
out a bit that is one thing I like about
a good Col pencil is that you can you do
have time to kind of smudge it and
manipulate it a little bit which i think
is really cool so last thing for my eyes
that I typically do is mascara of course
this is the voluminous lashes from
L'Oreal best mascara honestly most
mornings I don't even brush through my
lashes and curl them I just go straight
in my lashes are somewhat curled
naturally so if yours aren't I mean
you're gonna want to curl them but this
mascara just does such a great job of
lifting oh my gosh and just volumizing I
love this so so much
okay so the Ilyich has done what I like
to do last for my face because my face
was already mattified a lot from the
origins Matt moisturizer on days I don't
use this I usually will powder my face
but I don't feel like I need to set my
face like that so I'm just gonna go in
with a highlight I've been really into
just highlighting and not doing
everything else so instead of bronzing
and putting on blush I've been really
into just putting on highlighter and
today I'm using the essence pure nude
highlighter because it looks so pretty
and it's just a foolproof highlighter
and I just like to kind of just
highlight almost all not all over my
face but I just feel like it can look so
healthy you know when I'm in a hurry I
don't need the blush in the bronzer I
feel like this is the part that breathes
life into my face and I just love it and
this highlighter is amazing
next thing I'm going to use is for my
lips this is the milk makeup lip color
and whyphy and this stuff is it's not my
favorite lipstick formula but I just
really like this shade it's very it's
like a deeper color hold on I can't talk
and do this cuz I'm not lining
I don't always line my lips before work
again it's more of a I don't have the
time kind of a thing and I'm sure I'm
not alone in that
so this is my completed look from my you
know early morning wake up to when I'm
about to head out the door I feel like
it's quick I feel like I'm put together
and not like I had to skimp on anything
I've done a 5 minute makeup tutorial
before that I can link below and that is
when I'm like really in a rush out the
door and it's really I mean it's
different than this but it's not crazy
different but for this this I still feel
put together and glowy and healthy like
my skin looks healthy but you know I
love when I have the time to actually
put on a lip color you know other days
it's just lip balm and I'm sure you guys
have days like that too hopefully you
enjoyed the video and if you are
interested in trying the origins a matte
moisturizer I will link it below like I
said before I love this stuff it's kind
of changing my life and it's really
making my routine in the mornings really
really quick so other than that I hope
that you will subscribe before you leave
and I will see you guys in my next one
