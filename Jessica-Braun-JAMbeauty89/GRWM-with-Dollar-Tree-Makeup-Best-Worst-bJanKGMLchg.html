going to do a kind of get ready with me
I don't want the kind of get ready with
me with only dollar tree makeup because
over the years I bought a lot of makeup
from Dollar Tree from Dollar Tree and
I've done hauls I can link to some of
the ones I've done below
I haven't done a haul in a while but I
thought you know what a lot of you guys
have asked do the makeup items that you
buy from the Dollar Tree actually work
are they any good and I would say from
what I've tried it just depends so I
picked out a bunch of ones that I feel
like I see all the time if it all
retreats so the likelihood of you being
able to find these is higher than maybe
some other ones I've found so a lot of
them are the sassy and chic brand or la
colors la girl those kinds of actually
none of these are only girls mostly la
colors a few wet-and-wild actually only
one and color me so those are all brands
that you see all the time of the Dollar
Tree and I wanted to try them out with
you guys you could see ok do they
actually work or they not even worth the
dollar that they are so let's go ahead
and try I'm going to try to use as many
Dollar Tree items as possible there
might be a few trends I pull in a brush
just because I don't know how to apply
it without it I don't want to do this an
injustice and not actually try to make
it look good I want to actually see if
you can get a decent look with it does
that make sense so I want to do my best
let me put something to hold my hair
back there's like makeup on this I need
to wash it ok so one thing I'm not going
to use today but that I found were these
wet and wild under the sheets
makeup remover towelettes I guess I
don't know maybe I will have to use them
but I thought that was pretty cool that
they were there and there's ten of them
in there for a dollar I also found this
like nail polish remover thing where you
can put it in there or you could put
makeup remover in here but anyway you
push this with like a cotton round and
it will go up into it and usually you
can buy these already ready to go at
regular stores for like five dollars or
more but this is just an empty one I
thought that was so cool because then
you can use any nail polish remover
makeup remover whatever for it so I'm
excited I didn't know they sold this
alright so the foundation that I picked
out is this Afghan chic moisturizing
foundation I got in the shade white one
I don't know that there were very many
shades at all so let's give this a try
it actually looks like it might be a
decent match
me it's just in a squeezable bottle I
don't have I didn't find any brushes or
anything to apply it with and I didn't
think to buy you know they sell like the
cosmetic little wedges so I'm just going
to apply this with my fingers and just
blend it in with the brush and I'll use
the drugstore brush it feels really
actually the texture it feels a little
bit thicker than I would have expected
but not too thick so I'm just going to
dot this down the center of my face
first I'm going to use this brush it's
that Mota brand the set that they sell
and I think it actually does a pretty
good job I didn't have they didn't sell
any primers at least not at the Dollar
Tree I was at so it looks like it's not
a bad match for me it's covering some
redness you can see it's moisturizing
it's still showing some of my not oil I
haven't I guess it is a little but you
can still see some life and my skin
which I like foundations like that but I
know not everyone does now the cheeks
are where I can really tell if it's
working because I've got a lot of
pretzels some hyperpigmentation are
going to break out there and I do like
this brush by the way if you're curious
this that's actually really good um
okay so you can still see some my
freckle it definitely looks better but I
would not call this a high coverage
foundation by any means so that's after
one layer again you can definitely see
the life of my skin in fact I think it
made it more oily than it was so if you
are oily skin I would stay far away now
again it is a moisturizing foundation
I'm gonna put a second layer on and see
if we can build up some coverage here
mr. Dewan cheeks this time so I do think
it gave a little bit more coverage but
not that much more so I would say it's
light medium heavy medium coverage I do
think my skin looks better than I did
when I started but it's just very oily
and I don't say coño so I found a
powder there I think I remember seeing
one when I should have bought it oh boy
so it's going to be a really oily look
I'm going to put a blush on I didn't
find a bronzer there but this is a
really littering
and I have a feeling it's just gonna
like stick I'm going to see if this
steps a little bit you know in the
meantime let's do my brow so I found
this color makes brow powder and it's a
dark brown and medium brown and it says
long wearing it blends easily it has a
tiny little brush I'll try to use I
haven't used the powder in a while so
there's two different shades I'll start
with the dark I don't have it slowly
oh this brush is pretty rough not a
great match for me I want to try I'm
going to get to the medium and see
actually the medium might be better
maybe I'll just kind of mix the two it's
a very it pulls very red maybe I'll just
stick with a darker one because oh my
gosh I will say I mean it's really
pigmented so if you're trying to you
don't have money for other brow powders
I mean it certainly is filling in the
brows it's just a really bad color match
for me but like one swipe on this brow
like actually pretty much coated the
entire brow all right
so verdict on this is that I actually
don't think it's a bad powder at all
it's spread really easily like if you
get a little bit outside it wipes off
but I think you need is fully it doesn't
come with one I'm just to kind of brush
through and also if you want it to be a
cool kind of a brown I didn't see
anything
darker than this other than maybe like
black and this is a very red look I mean
it doesn't look horrible it's just not
what I like on myself and not what I'm
used to so it just looks a little bit
different that's all so it just depends
on the undertone you like all right it's
set a little bit more so let's go ahead
and try the blush this is the LA Colors
powder blush in peach rose and I'm going
to try to use the little brush it comes
with this is like the old school blushes
that like every drugstore brand used to
sell although that brush is not even
even we're going to look like the brush
got a really bad haircut let's just
watch this blush first actually it's
watching beautifully look at that swatch
it's a beautiful color in the glitter
is it as glittery as I thought it would
be you know what I'm going to do this
dress I'm not going to use that I'm
going to use a real plush brush because
I want to see how does this blush look
because I know that a lot of us at least
buy may be an elf blush brush something
so that you can apply blush better than
with that thing I want to do this
Jessica so we can see how it really
wears it's a pretty color because that
brush was just not it was just going to
be in weird tiny swirls you know I don't
think it gives us even of coverage of
some other blushes it is a lot though
I'm going to take my foundation brush
and just kind of lightly buff the edges
of that to make it look a little bit
better I think that they actually a
pretty decent blush
so those are the LA Colors powder
blushes by the way let's look at eyes
and then we'll do lips so I have a
couple of options for eye they had a lot
of eye things I don't have an eye primer
but what I might do is take a little of
this Foundation and I didn't have
concealer either I might like legitimate
and seal and prime my eyes with this you
know I'll do it with my finger so
hopefully it'll actually actually it's
concealing pretty well if you do it with
your finger all right so I kind of have
even that area out just a little more I
feel like I look like a wax doll right
now with the Whalley okay anyway so I
got this LA Colors eyeshadow nude 12
color palette and I guess it's called
glamorous I just like the colors in it a
lot of them are really really similar to
each other I also got this LA Colors eye
is in the shade sunflower it's like a
little trail there I might've illness in
the past I feel like I did and I really
really liked it I just remember it being
really pigmented maybe a little more so
than the other palette I just showed is
so we'll see I figure those are really
pretty colors together so i'm swatching
the 12 color palette right now and I
have to admit like some of them are kind
of surprising me they're not like urban
decay like once wise amazing but some of
them
have more pigments than I would have
guessed and some of them don't so it's
kind of a hit or miss and I'm sure
that's true with their palates oh wow
they have this like bright peering
Winkle color that's kind of cool so I'm
going to start now I'm going to have to
use brushes for some of this because
again I want to do it justice if I can't
fairly compare things like this if I'm
only using a sponge tip applicator when
when I do other palettes I'm using all
the brushes I own so I want to use
regular brushes with this as much as I
can because I want to see like if I were
to use it regularly day to day could I
make it look nice and I hope that makes
sense to you guys because I know a lot
of these videos people use only what it
came with which I get because it's fun
and it's more of a challenge but I want
to see if these actually can look up I
feel like ever being myself so I grab
just the white powder here and a fluffy
brush and I'm just kind of setting that
a primer that I put on my eyes which
really is just the foundation just to
kind of even it out again to kind of set
that and then what I typically will do
once I've done that and it does feel
really says a little bit more I
typically will grab some kind of a
medium to light brown in my crease and
that's what I'll do I think I'm going to
grab it's kind of this bottom corner
shade here again a lot of these are
really really similar boom
actually had more color than I would
have guessed and I'm just kind of
putting it in my crease as a transition
shade kind of a base for that area it's
actually really pretty it's a nice tone
for this place on your eye it's kind of
a it's like a light brown but it does
have more of like that almost pinky
purplish pull to it and I think that's
really pretty now I've done like three
layers but for again for transition
shades this is perfect because it really
does give a wash of color
since it's not pigmented enough to like
put it in then not be able to move it
something said um so now I'm going to
grab a little bit smaller of a brush and
I'm going to get one of the deeper
shades so maybe this like brown here
actually let's do there's like this kind
of vert kind of reddish
right here let's try that one and I'm
just putting it a little bit more into
the kind of outer corner up into the
crease but not too far up although I
accidentally interests it a little bit
too far up this is got some pretty good
pigmentation too honestly I mean you can
see the color that's good let's see how
it blends I'm taking just a fluffy brush
and blending those kind of together and
up that's not terrible so let's try one
of these shades I'm going to try it's
really none of these are going to make
sense because it's kind of turned into
like a purplish look but I really want
to try one of these let's try like the
Rose bronzy gold in the middle and I'm
just going to Pat it onto my lid and
we'll kind of make it work together this
is such a pretty color isn't it Wow
I mean that's got some punch to it and I
pretty much always apply my lid color
whatever it is with my finger just
because I feel like it does a better job
at just being I don't know I just like
doing it this way so now I'm going to
take more of that kind of reddish not
really reddish brown color that we were
using and blend that into that
and then I'm going to go back to my
actually we'll use maybe this color here
that's right next to it to blend all of
that together it's not the most cohesive
look I've ever done but all oh so then
I'm going to take the sponge applicator
in that white shade and I'm going to put
it right under my brow bone very white
the one good thing about sponge tip
applicator is is that you really can use
them I mean they're not amused walnut
that is not blending well together so I
will say that that's not the rest of it
I think blend is pretty well together
I'm going to use the sponge tip
applicator and I'm going to take that
kind of depth shade I use on my lid and
I'm going to put it on my lower lash
line as well I really do like this shade
kind of just focusing on the outer
corner I'm not really going too far in I
do feel like we need something on the
outer corner just a little bit darker so
I'm going to take this Brown that in
this trio and maybe a smaller brush
maybe a little bit more flat brush this
it's kind of like a pencil brush let's
try that this is not really darkening it
at all kind of blending right away so I
would say with this trio if you're
trying to use it as anything but you
like lid color I don't know like it's
darkened it a little bit I just don't
think see I already feel like that color
on my lid has faded a little bit so
there's one downside is I don't know if
the same powder power is very good so
let's move on I am going to try I have
two eyeliners here at the LA Colors auto
eyeliner in black and it says the
defines eyes no sharp and are needed I
also think that the LA Colors liquid
eyeliner in black and this is an
ultrafine tip for precise lining and
control I'm not great with liners like
that so we'll see how I do I like
tip 1 but that's just me but what I
usually do is I type mine with a pencil
liner so we're going to try this LA
Colors 1 it does have a fine tip when
you start seems pretty black it's not
the creamiest and it's not the blackest
so we'll see and I feel like you know
for a couple dollars more you can get
like the Milani one that's crazy
gel like and it's like five dollars
essence has pretty good eyeliner so feel
like for this it's worth spending a
little more but let's try it let's try
yeah it's not super blood like at all
like I can I feel like I'm going back
and forth the back course and it's like
not doing anything yeah this is horrible
oh my gosh this is like the worst island
ever used so I would say no pass on this
eyeliner let's try the liquid liner that
was really bad I was really bad let me
shake it out really good I don't know
how long this is been sitting in the
Dollar Tree
that's the other thing you don't know
how long that makes it's been sitting
there it definitely is a very fine tip a
very very fine tip so oh my gosh it's
really black but it's also really really
watery so it's like dripping down my
lashes does that make sense
it is really black I have to admit it
sorry for I mean honestly for me I think
it's an OK eyeliner really truly and way
better than the pencil I just don't like
this style of eyeliner I'm very partial
to felt tips and so for me this was just
not easy to use because I'm just not
used to using this tight now I think if
you are used to using this type like the
NYC one you'll probably like it cause it
seemed girly black I will say it's been
a while and I feel like it's not drying
down so it's got kind of a shiny black
which again that's not my taste but I
know some people really like I'm not
good at like I cannot clean that wing up
so alright so before we do the lips
let's try lashes so this wasn't
la colors mascara it's their bold lash
mascara so that plumps lashes it's got a
latch defining brush and I got it in the
shade very black so let's give this bad
boy try I know my experiments are tricky
because even the best mascaras sometimes
the first week you're using it it's just
not great because it almost needs the
air to get into it with each use to get
a little bit better it dries out just a
little bit so we'll see you but it's got
a really big big brush where you can see
so far I feel like I'm just brushing my
lashes and nothing is getting on them
like it I will agree it could it's
combing through my lashes which I
appreciate I think a lot of mascaras
don't and it's nice that this one does
but I genuinely feel like I'm like
favorably putting anything on that's not
doing anything like even on my lower
lashes you can barely see this is weird
try the other ones I feel like this is a
lash tint like it's hardly putting it
again never you somehow secure this bad
ever
usually it's the opposite in like too
much of getting on but I can't get like
this to stay on my lashes this is so
weird
so mascara was the bust I really got in
there and off camera and swiped it on as
much as I could this is as bold as I'm
going to get it it's okay if you like a
very natural lash look you might love
this but I mean this is as much as I can
get to stick the last part is my lips so
I have two options I might just try both
this is the LA Colors chunky lip pencil
it's a retractable lint pencil I got in
the shade coral pond I also got the LA
Colors lip gloss in the shade coral
crush and it says that moisturizes lifts
with vitamin E the packaging on the lip
gloss actually is pretty cute with the
white and the gold so I figure let's try
two lip pencil and then we'll put the
blip gloss on top just to be able to try
both I'm just curious
and they have some lipsticks there but I
was curious I hadn't seen the chunky lip
pencil yet so just watching it if they
oh it's actually a pretty decent amount
of pigment there
that's right hmm Ashley feels pretty
comfortable
I have to admit I'm pleasantly surprised
by this lip color it feels like I think
that it's kind of moisturizing it feels
kind of moisturizing like a balm but it
has a lot more color than I would have
guessed let me take this off that's
really nice
let's try to go off on top I mean
something I might do in real life it
should put a gloss on top again this
packaging is really pretty this looks
like a yes more of a sheer wash type of
a gloss it does have some color to it
let's try yeah it's just kind of bullets
no really good kind of fruity it smells
really nice it's not it's not sticky
it's just kind of just glossy I really
like the smell of that sorry they're
doing yard work apparently and boy that
is loud I like it I actually think they
look really nice together now I
mentioned the wipes and I've got some
swatches to wipe off let's try them
these are the wet and wild under the
sheet ten makeup remover towelettes now
I've told you guys before I really don't
use white on my face I pretty much only
use them for swatches I like just using
like cleansing balls on my face I feel
like they took a little less but let's
try this Wow even got the eyeliner off
so that's actually pretty good item it I
feel like sometimes you'll try them and
they just don't work but these do work I
kind of wish I would have bought a
couple packs of this so if you CDs and
you use them for swatches because they
do have a strong smell that's kind of
like like you maybe wouldn't want to use
on your face I don't know if you have
used these on your face and your face is
reacted well to it please let us know
down below but it certainly got those
off as you saw really really well so I
kind of wish I would have bought in a
couple packs of these bobbins would have
bought a few packs of me so to sum it up
my favorite products I bought the
foundation is actually pretty good again
you have to have the right skin type for
it you have to be able to find your
shade you know so there's so many things
I just wish I had a powder from the
Dollar Tree to set it with so if I were
doing this for real I would have
definitely put either powder foundation
on top if I wanted more coverage or just
a loose powder to set it something like
that you could even use the Rimmel stay
matte like four dollars and that powder
is great at just soaking up oil setting
it but it doesn't add a lot of coverage
but it would have been a cheap option to
throw on top of this this foundation
reminds me in a way of the wet and wild
cover all but the cover all is less dewy
but it's very similar kind of well
similar packaging probably similar
ingredients anyways I was surprised
pleasantly by the blush I thought that
was really nice I really liked this trio
of eyeshadow but again it does fade and
you can already see it's fading a little
bit the liquid eyeliner I thought was
pretty good it tried down a little bit
more but again it still has that wet
look to it if you like that I was very
pleasantly surprised I think maybe most
of all by the lip products they were
really nice these are comfortable I
think it's a really nice summery kind of
juicy look for the lips and I thought
the wet wild white circus now the dud
the LA Colors eyeliner was terrible the
LA Colors bulb lash mascara was just not
my cup of tea it's very very light
mascara if you like that I just did not
like the brow powder just color wise I
thought it was a good powder itself just
not a good match for me and I could just
kind of I don't know this was kind of
mess for me it wasn't horrible but it
certainly is not amazing right so it
just depends on what you're looking for
it did a great job being a wash of color
on my eyes which I liked but I don't
think I'm going to go buy more of these
so those are my two cents on all the
products if you have recommendations for
Dollar Tree products that you actually
think are really really good please let
us know down below so other people can
see that so I can see it if you like
this kind of a video please give it a
thumbs up so that I know I hope that
you'll stick around watch some more of
my affordable Beauty videos and
otherwise I will see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
