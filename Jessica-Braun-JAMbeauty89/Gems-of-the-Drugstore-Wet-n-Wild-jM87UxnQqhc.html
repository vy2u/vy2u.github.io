going to start a brand new segment that
I'm gonna call I think I'm gonna call it
something like gems of the drugstore
drugstore gems because these are
wonderful ones and I think I'll feature
it per brand so today's brand is gonna
be wet and wild there are so many
wonderful wonderful products that they
sell that are so inexpensive I mean all
of their products are inexpensive so
we're gonna start with the one that most
people know about but if you don't
you're welcome the wet wild eyes shadows
are amazing and they sell them in single
form for a dollar ninety-nine this one's
in the shade nutty and it's absolutely
gorgeous I've heard that it's a dupe for
Mac satin taupe it's a really really
pretty crease color just I mean it's
stunning really and then another one
that I love that I've had to kind of
push back together because it broke is
Brule and this is just a matte like
cream color it's a great blending color
so get a little bit up on a fluffy brush
and blend all your shadows together
that's how I use it it's also a nice non
shimmery brow bone color they're only a
dollar ninety-nine and they have like
bright colors to like blues and purples
and things like that and then they also
have their 8 pan palettes this one is
called comfort zone these I think are
five dollars give or take and this one
has just a bunch of gorgeous colors in
it a lot of people own this it's an
inexpensive way to have a lot of
different options for eyeshadow you
can't beat it they also have one called
petal pusher out right now that I think
are like it's purples and they have a
blue palette that's called blue had me
at hello and those are a bunch of blue
shades so lots of options out there they
also put out limited edition ones I have
some out here with me right now this
one's called Sparkle till morning and
this one's called nude Awakening these
are not easy to find some of them aren't
even out in stores anymore I know you
can find a lot of these online like eBay
but people are charging ridiculous
amounts so is it worth it if you can
find a friend maybe that has it can send
it to you which is what I did great but
otherwise it they're hard to find but
comfort zone is a gorgeous palette and
actually this shadow right here this top
well
Tapan this is my favorite crease color
ever it's like this greyish olive green
it is beautiful and if you're
fair-skinned I think it looks really
nice with fair-skinned
so okay another product worth trying
that has I think replaced Revlon
Colorstay for my favorite foundation and
it surprises me every time I use it is
the wet and wild cover all foundation
this stuff makes me smile because it's
so cheap it's 399 and this stuff is
amazing only problem is if you the shade
selection is small so if you can't find
a shade you like you can maybe mix I
don't know maybe that wouldn't be worth
it but I have it in the shade 816 which
is fair slash light it is perfect for my
skin tone and I love it
in it again it's perfect for my skin
type so if you have really really dry
skin you might not like it if you have
really really well I'm kind of right in
the middle so it works really really
well
oh it's 3:9 unite like I can never get
over it I want to buy like a million
because if they ever just continue this
I don't know what I would do because
it's beautiful and it looks really
really nice applied with the Beauty
Blender but you can also apply it just
with your fingers and it looks really
flawless so I would say this is medium
to high coverage and you know it just
depends on how much you put on but even
if you put on a little a little bit I
would say it's still medium coverage it
is amazing oh and it doesn't break me
out I've been using this for months I
love it okay so another gem that I have
found recently because it's a new
product they have it's the wet and wild
by Fergie take on the day eyeshadow
primer it looks like this it's got a lot
of product I think this is around five
dollars the primer comes out like that
and it's just you know a nude color it
doesn't it kind of cancels out some
coloration you might have but not a ton
but it holds on to that shadow I'm
telling you ladies it doesn't go
anywhere and it's five bucks and so much
product I would say this is absolutely
comparable to the Urban Decay primer
potion
I haven't reebok that stuff because this
is frankly I think it might be better I
really really like it's five bucks it's
so definitely check that out and I know
I keep finding dollar off wet'n wild
coupons so check online for coupons you
can print cuz that's awesome ok another
one if you haven't tried these out you
should these are I think 399 the wet
bottle blushes I only have one it's
pearlescent pink these suckers are
pigmented oh my gosh whoa I mean you
look wow look at that it's right there I
mean it's a these are incredible
I really don't need to say more it comes
with a little brush which is great you
can really could use and it's kind of
curved which actually I've never noticed
but you can really get in there with it
if you really needed to have something
and you didn't want to bring brushes you
know so that's always really nice and 4
bucks for a blush that a that's gonna
last you a long time and it's gonna last
you all day these don't go anywhere
I have higher-end blushes that will wear
off quicker than the wet-and-wild does
that's saying something
okay another gem that I use almost every
day is the wet and wild color icon
bronzer it has an SPF of 15 which means
this does expire usually it has a date
on it yeah like this expires in August
of 2014 anyway it's in the shade you
reserved your Cabana for me it's not a
bronzer it is a highlight now a lot of
people say they don't like it because it
doesn't really it's not shimmery but
that's exactly what I love about it and
actually I'm gonna put a little bit on
right now because I don't have any it's
just it's perfect it's like a just a
glowy but it's not obvious and that's
what I love about it because every day
when I'm going to teach or do whatever
I'm doing I don't want to have like a
disco ball on my face so this is perfect
I know some people that will use this
for an all-over powder for me I think
it's a little too glowy to have all over
for my skin but as a little subtle
highlight oh it's gorgeous and you're
never gonna run out of this it's gonna
expire before you run out of it look how
much product that is and this I think is
about 399 as well I love this product
another highlight that they sell its the
wet and wild by Fergie this is in Rose a
champagne glow and this I think is
really comparable to like Mac MSF's
there it's a beautiful pinkish highlight
and I just think it's really really
pretty I washed it there you can see
it's so pretty
just so pretty again I think these are
around $5 tons of product you're never
gonna run out of it and if you have
never really played with highlight
before however I would recommend this
one just because it's not so intense but
if you're looking for a more intense one
then definitely try this one it's
gorgeous
okay and also the wet ball by 30 line is
kicking some booty because I loved this
stuff too this is the wet wild by Fergie
cream eyeliner and it's in the shade
little black dress which is really just
black now I've heard both sides
some people hate this some people like
it now I will say this is very different
than most cream eyeliners most cream
eyeliners are kind of thicker which is
what I typically like I love my L'Oreal
infallible one and it's a thicker
consistency this is very thin however it
packs a big punch because it's very
black I'm wearing it today I've been
wearing it a lot lately because I've
just been trying to switch up my routine
I always use my L'Oreal so I wanted to
try something new I think this is around
five dollars but it's like I said it's
thin so you've got a you kind of have to
put on maybe like two layers but it
lasts all day I mean I really like this
stuff it's a little bit cheaper than the
L'Oreal which is nice and plenty of
product in there I really like it I
would recommend it I mean when wild I
just I remember when I was like in high
school I was like wow that's like cheap
like crappy except for then I tried some
things and I was like whoa this is
better than some high-end products like
it's just crazy to think that you can
spend so little and have amazing staying
power amazing pigmentation and just
amazing products so definitely check
them out if you never have these are
some products that I've loved many of
them I've loved for quite a while if you
have any more wet-and-wild
recommendations please let me know
because there's so many other products
I've never tried that I'm always kind of
leery about so let me know what you love
from them below and I can't wait to read
them and I'll talk to you guys very soon
