to share with you guys how I get ready
for the day using only my favorite
drugstore products these are some of my
Holy Grail products that I love these
are products that are inexpensive you
can find them at the drugstore I love
everything listed and linked below if
you're interested in them I'm excited to
announce that I am collaborating with
Olay and cosmopolitan for this video and
I have a special video from Leah who is
the beauty editor at cosmopolitan hey
Leah hi Jessica I'm Leah wire from
cosmopolitan thanks so much for having
me on your channel
I chose olay regenerist micro-sculpting
cream with SPF 30 to win the 2016 Cosmo
Beauty award for the smartest daily
treatment I love that this product not
only has anti-aging properties to keep
you looking young but now it's packed
with SPF to help combat daily sun
exposure can't wait to see how you use
this product I should get ready for your
day using all your favorite drugstore
products I am so excited so I can't wait
to show you guys how I use the Olay
micro sculpting cream in my daily
routine I've been using this for weeks
now and I am obsessed with it so let's
go ahead and get into how I get ready
using my favorite drugstore products so
the first step in my routine is my olay
regenerist micro-sculpting cream with
sunscreen I love this stuff because a it
has a pump always a win in my book and
that really is the best way to keep the
ingredients in skincare stable so I
really like that but not only that but
it has SPF of 30 and I've kind of
realized you know I'm 27 years old it's
never too early to start doing skincare
and oh my gosh this stuff smells so good
oh my gosh it smells just so clean but
nice and it's not like a crazy strong
smell or anything anyway it's never too
early to start taking care of your skin
and honestly from what I've heard the
number one cause of I'm putting it where
I know I get like Sun the most the
number one cause of Aging in our faces
is exposure to Sun and the thing is
there's such a thing as incidental sun
exposure where it's not just when you're
outside like just
the summer it's all year long and it's
when you're inside and there's like
light coming in through a window or
maybe you're driving or you know it
doesn't really matter we're still being
exposed to those UV rays so it's so
important to just protect all day long
and the reason I am so obsessed with
this stuff besides the fact that I was a
pump and besides the fact that it smells
really nice is because not only does it
have that SPF but it actually has good
skincare ingredients so I'm not just
piling the SPF on my skin because I have
tried a lot of SPF swear I feel like
it's just making my skin like it's just
kind of clogging my pores but this stuff
is actually good for your skin it has a
lot of good ingredients so it's actually
helping with anti aging on top of the
fact that it's also protecting from the
Sun so it's a win and I think my
favorite thing about it is the fact that
it doesn't feel greasy like it doesn't
even look greasy and I love that like
this is the way I want my skin to look
right before I put on makeup because I
feel like every other SPF I've ever
tried from other brands just makes my
skin look really greasy just oil slick
and it doesn't feel good for my skin so
I don't want to use it every day and so
that I'm not and then my skin is exposed
all the time so this is like finally the
two in one skincare plus SPF and it
actually looks good under makeup so it's
all a win in my book if you haven't
tried it you have got to try this I know
that you can visit they're all a
skincare advisor online and find out you
know you can share what your skin type
is and find out what's best for you in
their range of products I would
recommend this for everyone because it's
amazing but they have a lot of other
stuff so definitely check that I'll put
the link on the screen as well as below
if you're interested so for primer today
I'm going to use this elf one I will
list the name of it because it's not on
here and of course all of these things
are listed and linked below so it's a
moisturizing primer so I'm going to put
that on my face
and again that old lay was such a
perfect canvas for that because I feel
like you know my skin doesn't feel crazy
oily it already feels ready for makeup
my lips feel a little bit dry I'm gonna
put on some of this Milani moisture lock
rosehip oil infusion it's just like a
tint tinted oil but I just really like
it I've been using it kind of as a lip
balm like in the mornings when I'm
getting ready so I'm just gonna put that
on to kind of moisturize while I finish
getting ready so I typically do my face
before I do my eyes I know some people
do it the other way around this is the
elf flawless finish foundation that I'll
be applying again it also has a pump can
you tell I'm obsessed with pumps so I
wear it in the color sands
I'm just gonna kind of dot it everywhere
so I wear the Knicks got you covered
when I want a lot of coverage under my
eyes and then I wear the Maybelline
instant age rewind when I'm just like
it's kind of like it every day so I
think I'm just gonna go with the
Maybelline for today so you just kind of
twist it up
this is for me usually when I just set
my makeup just a little bit before I put
anything else on top of it because I
like to have a kind of mattified canvas
before I start putting on other powder
products I don't know that's just me
because I feel like if it's too tacky
all the powder just kind of sticks to it
so I'm using the NYC smooth skin loose
face powder then translucent and this is
actually the second one of these that I
have bought I'm just getting it onto a
powder puff and just kind of just
rolling it onto my skin
you're gonna hair on your face and you
cannot find like where it is and you're
like freaking out so I'm also going to
set my under eye with this NYX HD
finishing powder in banana this stuff is
really really good it's kind of a recent
find for myself but I really really like
it it's a great alternative if you don't
necessarily bake like I don't typically
fake my makeup but I just kind of like
having something to set that area and
kind of brighten it a little bit
especially if I'm not using a high
coverage concealer like today so I'm
using my butter bronzer for my bronzer
and honorable mention this brush I'm not
gonna mention all the brushes I use but
this blending brush from ELF is
incredible for bronzer I love it I just
wash it and I'm excited to have it dry
again so I can use it because it's so
lightly you know conduct it wherever you
want the bronzer and this is a really
light bronzer I have it in the light
bronzer shade they also have a one
that's supposedly a little deeper though
I've looked at it like in the store and
it does not look much deeper than this
like if any deeper so it's kind of
confusing to me
so you notice it didn't do anything
crazy bronzer II to my face but I do
like having it a because this smells
like coconuts and it's amazing but I
just like having just a little hint of
something a little bit deeper on my skin
because I am so fair and my face doesn't
necessarily match my skin so because I
do try to protect my skin with SPF so it
is much paler than the rest of my body
for blush I'm using this elf studio
blush and mellow mauve and it's just the
perfect everyday color I've been wearing
it everyday
isn't it just nice
so for highlight I'm using a newly
discovered favorite of mine this is the
Physicians Formula nude where like kind
of shimmer brick and it's called natural
nude and it is absolutely stunning I've
been wearing it every single day since I
bought it honestly one of the prettiest
highlights I've ever used and it's you
know physicians forum is a little bit
pricey for drugstore maybe like $12.99
but I love it
so I like to do my brows next and then
my eyes and then usually at the end I
touch-up my brows a little bit more in
case like them i shadow get to them I
don't know why I do it in this order I
just do and it's what I'm used to so
that's what we're gonna do because I'm
trying to keep it real with you guys
before I do that though I do want to
take my Physicians Formula youthful
we're in the illuminating finish and
take that fluffy powder brush I was
using and I like to kind of blend my
bronzer at the bottom as well because I
again I don't want it to look crazy
chisel I just want to look it to look
kind of seamless so I like to kind of
blend it just a tinge with some powder
foundation so it can look a little bit
more uniform I don't think that helped
at all so again I'm torn about what brow
product I want to use I have three
options I'm gonna show them all to you
because they're all really good and then
I'll pick which one I want to actually
use
I love the NYX taemin frame if you're
using a if you want to use like a pomade
which I've been really into the anasazi
one lately but the next one really is
good and I've been using it lately to
test it out as a dupe and I really like
it
I also really like the NYX micro brow
pencil total dupe for the honest
the abroad ways which I also have and
then I also love this owl elf
brow pencil it's literally two dollars I
just bought another one last night
because I'd run out of mine I think
that's what I'm going to use cuz I
missed it I've been out of it for a
while so it's just a pointed tip on this
side it's a little bit thicker than like
the micro pencils and then it has a
really big spoolie the only wish I have
is that this bully were a little bit
smaller anyway but this color is in I
think it was neutral Brown so it's kind
of more of a cool it's not it doesn't
pull his red so I think that's what I'm
gonna use I haven't used a pencil only
on my eyebrows in a while but I'm I'm
kind of excited to try again when I
barrel on one eyebrow off I always feel
like I look absolutely crazy I remember
as a kid watching my mom get ready and
watching her do her eyebrows she's still
glamorous she even did her eyebrows like
20 years ago 20 years ago
anyway um and I remember thinking she
looked crazy when she had like one I
read on or she would have her eyebrows
done but like not her eyes and like oh
like it always looked crazy to me anyway
you feel a little bit more like myself
when my browser done I have to admit I
went camping recently and I went with
like like three other couples
so like six of our friends and it was so
much fun
it was RV camping so it's kind of
glamping but it was really really fun
but I remember like me and my friend
Laura were like wait so like do we want
to do our makeup or like should we not
we ended up doing your makeup I was like
that is the beauty life for sure when
you're camping you're like I just don't
want to do my makeup and I still kind of
did my breath for my eye primer I'm
gonna use this Milani shadow eyes and
almond cream I just love this stuff you
can sharpen it it I've clearly got some
makeup residue going on on my eyes right
now and I just have like fading I'd like
to cover up and it really holds on to
shadow really well it's all the win gosh
I forget how good this stuff is
sometimes when I don't use it for a
while so I'm torn about what I look I
want to do I never do the same I look
two days in a row and I'm being so
serious with you guys it's usually
around the same like it's usually you
know some kind of neutral matte in the
crease and then something maybe shower
on the lid but it really doesn't
drastically change I'm sure you've
noticed that lately I've been
experienced experimenting a lot more but
so I'm not 100% sure what look I'm gonna
do today because that would be my
everyday like I said I'm trying to keep
it real and I don't always do the same
thing I kind of just live one so I'm
gonna I've pulled out this elf palette
in nude rose gold just because I think
it is freaking gorgeous look at these
colors so I'm gonna use some of this I
might make send my ELF mad format
palette which is also just an amazing
palette but it's matte I don't think
these are the best shadows in the world
I really don't but I do think they're
amazing for the price and you can get
quite a selection and it is really hard
to find a matte palette like this this
is amazing so I want to use some of that
I also might throw in my favorite thing
I cannot stop using it's the elf
long-lasting lustrous eyeshadow and
soirée it's this unbelievable like
Ankush maroon glitter cream it's unreal
so I want to put that on my lips but I'm
gonna do that at the end because it
really layers well on top of powder
shadow so I'm gonna start with just
something kind of light in the crease
just to make sure that it all is kind of
married together so I'm going to use
this fourth shade from the left here
kind of a matte medium brown honestly
it's kind of cool tone I've been doing a
lot of warm tones lately but I'm kind of
not minding the cool Tony there that's
usually what I go for so I'm just kind
of blending that into the crease this is
kind of the most unbelievably perfect
crease color if you just want a little
shadow I mean isn't that just like the
perfect color now if you're much darker
than me obviously it wouldn't work you'd
maybe I mean you'd need honestly some of
these in the matte palette would be good
crease color
I'm gonna try this third one it's kind
of a I don't know like a cool bronze and
I'm just gonna use my finger cuz
honestly when it's a lid shadow I
usually just use my finger I can't even
lie to you guys
I don't usually pull out a brush I just
throw it on with my finger and then
blend like the corners with the brush
the shade is just really pretty again an
easy kind of one shadow look if you just
want to throw this on your eyelid and
then blend it into the crease and go
which I keep mentioning in videos cuz
I'm like obsessed with it's just a
pretty color it's not too deep but it's
deep enough that it kind of adds a
little bit of definition so I'm gonna go
ahead and put on the elf long lustrous
long lasting lustrous eyeshadow with
some helpful and then I'm gonna deepen
the crease just a little bit so this
stuff is weird because it's a cream kind
of it's like a mousse kind of it's like
the weirdest texture if you've never
touched one you should so I just love
this color my friend Carol Lago here on
YouTube who I met in New York at an elf
event hat was wearing it and I was like
losing my mind over it so she told me
what it was so that's when I got it but
it's just the prettiest oh my gosh it's
so pretty I can't stop wearing it I find
myself reaching for it and wearing it
every day I'm not even exaggerating at
all it's been weeks since I have not
worn this and of course the beauty never
quite comes across on camera the way I
wanted to in the way it does in real
life but I get a lot of compliments when
I wear this just cuz it's such an almost
unique color I don't know why but I feel
like that's kind of a unique color on
the eyelid you know you can find it in
some palettes it's not that you can't
find it but with this texture in this
look to it and the fact that it's got
glitter but it doesn't have any follow
up because it is kind of embedded in
this kind of creamy moosie texture so
I'm going to use that same brush I use
if I can find it for my crease just to
kind of blend that into it there's not
much to blend to be honest but I like to
make sure it doesn't look crazy and
crisp
want it to look like a crisp edge there
I have to admit yesterday I used this
shadow here in the mat format mad format
palette in my crease and I like in the
light of the morning it looked great
like I'm looking the mirror I'm like you
look real good jazz and then like it
literally took me until at the end of
the school day because I'm a teacher if
you didn't know I got in my car and
looked in my rearview mirror and I was
like what in the like what did I put all
over like I looked like a clown like
what so I'm like I have got to look in
like more than one mirror in the morning
other than like my little smart near
thing because I'm everything looks great
in that mirror but it doesn't always
look great in the light of day so for me
like I that should have been like almost
a crease color not a not a like blended
all the way up kind of color does that
make sense or maybe like an outer corner
color instead so speaking of deeper
deeper colors though I do want to put
something kind of in my outer crease
area I'm gonna pull this kind of deeper
brown from the mat format palette right
there and I'm just gonna put a little
bit of it just in the outer corner just
to kind of pull the look all together
so I'm gonna take this lighter color
just to kind of blend it this one here
the fourth one in just kind of blended
cause it is a little darker honestly
then I kind of anticipated that's always
a good way to blend out the edges and
just straight up into the brow bone to
kind of lighten that area as well and
then I'm gonna add back in the rose gold
the nude rose gold palette I'm gonna add
this kind of brighter like bone white
color just right under my brow bone
nothing super fancy nothing super
precise just kind of patting it there
just to kind of lighten that area a
little bit
honestly we spend as much time on our
eyes as we do the rest of our face it's
kind of crazy if you think about it so
I'm now going to kind of line the bottom
of my eyes with shadow I almost always
do this I know not everyone does but I
like to do that
even whether or not I'm gonna wear a
liner liner on the bottom of my eye I
like to still line somewhat with a
deeper color I'm going to use that
deeper Brown I used on my outer corner
actually it might be yeah I think that's
the one I used and just with a thin
brush kind of line the bottom outer
corner of that
so some like residue eyeliner over I
swear I never has anyone ever gotten
every single flake of like eye makeup
off I swear I always have something
because this is kind of honestly like a
simple not simple but like a not a crazy
look you know not a crazy vampy look I
think I am going to tightline my bottom
lash line so I'm using this anyway
professional intense color gel eyeliner
in black this is one that I bought a
while ago and it really is so good and I
felt like I had so many black eyeliners
that I never get to use them all but I
recently pulled this out and I was like
oh my gosh this stuff is amazing so it's
super creamy it stays all day so I'm
going to tighten the top of my lashes
and then kind of do my waterline I don't
know why sit kind of I'm going to do my
waterline with this as well
if you've been watching me for a while
you know I like triple-layer my liner
and I'm not joking when I say I do this
most days this is the Rimmel gel
eyeliner in black and I really do like
this it's a very black it does not budge
and I like to put this on top once I've
kind of tight line I just put it on my
top lash line just to kind of thicken
that line I need to show you what I just
did I don't know how it happened I
usually use this brush for my eyeliner
this one is so similar but this is
actually a brow brush so I just used my
breath I guess it doesn't it's literally
the same so I guess it doesn't matter if
it's kind of funny I was like let's know
what I usually use that before so when I
said triple-layer so I usually do a
pencil liner a gel or cream liner and
then a liquid liner and usually really
the liquid liner for me is just to do
like kind of mini wing I don't usually
do a dramatic wing each day but I do
like doing just a little bit of one and
by the way I just really say I haven't
mentioned what it is this is the essence
eyeliner pen and waterproof what I like
about this is it really is waterproof I
did a waterproof test video where I
stood in the shower for two minutes with
makeup on and then got out and white huh
I think literally everything I was
wearing was still intact so if you're
interest in that video I'll link it up
there and down below but I was amazed
and this was one of the products I used
and it totally is waterproof but if you
use makeup remover it comes off really
quick so it's kind of the best of both
worlds my favorite step mascara okay
it's not my favorite set but I love this
product so much I just repurchased this
and when I purchase something to me
that's like the ultimate love letter to
that product because I have so many
things high-end low-end whatever you
want to call it but when I repurchase
something that means I loved it so much
I
on it again and this is the covergirl
super sizer mascara I thought I would
have hate this mascara I thought hate
the packaging the brush is weird like
there's no way and then I tried it
notice like what is this magical potion
that I'm putting on my eyelashes so I'm
going to comb through them really
quickly curl them and then I will apply
the mascara
reason this blush is not blush brush is
so weird it's because there's like edges
that you can comb through and then edges
that are just like pure product which is
great because once you get used to using
it you use the comb through part to
really like that's what I'm using right
now to really separate lashes and get
them pushed up and then you use the
product D part to add some volume to
like the tips etc so it really is one of
those things where like the more you
practice using this product the better
you get at it it's almost like a tool
and its own way and the product layers
really well so like I've got that first
layer of mascara on this I'm going to do
this site and then I can come back kind
of comb through it again and add a
little bit more volume and definition I
have four of my favorite drugstore lip
product ever these are the maybelline
color blurs the idea of these is that
you can use one side to like blur it all
with it's just like a rubbery thing I
never ever used that side I love it
because you don't need a lip liner it's
a lip liner lipstick matte stick
whatever you want to call all-in-one and
it is amazing so I've got four colors
trying to decide I know this one's like
a berry shade but it looks more like
well it is called my my magenta but I
feel like this looks more like berry and
it's actually just bright pink so I
don't know where that today I've already
worn that in a video recently I think
I'm gonna warrant wear this amazing red
just because of it
I love wearing red lipstick I wear to
work maybe once a week if that just
because it's so much upkeep no matter
what brand I'm wearing you know I'm
working a very long day and I'm drinking
coffee and I'm drinking water and I'm
eating lunch so it's hard for me to have
just one red and not have I mean I'm
obviously gonna have to reapply this
stuff though is pretty close to not
having to touch up too much this shade
is partnering crimson and let's just
apply it I love this so much
the reason I am so obsessed with this
stuff is not only the reasons I
mentioned but it's really thin you don't
feel like you have to reapply it
constantly and it doesn't feel
uncomfortable it kind of is in a weird
way moisturizing I mean I wouldn't say
it's like lip balm by any means but it
doesn't feel dry instantly like a lot of
matte lipsticks that once they dry
you're like look this actually feels
pretty comfortable throughout the time
you're wearing it the last thing I'm
going to do is apply this Maybelline
master fix spray and I really like this
stuff because if you've got kind of a
powdery look to your face then I don't
mean like obviously a highlights not
gonna look super powdery even if it is a
powder but like everything else can look
really powdery and so I love applying a
setting spray I really like this one
just because you spray it it almost
spray it kind of pushes everything
together what I've been doing lately is
I take a big fluffy brush and I actually
will spray it onto the brush and then
kind of lightly dust it all over my face
so for me this is a look that I do a lot
especially the facial look like I said
the eyes I do differently every day but
everything else I wear all the time and
it lasts all day long like I don't look
in the mirror at the end of the day and
think oh my gosh like what other than
like I mentioned the eye look I did the
other day that looks crazy but that has
nothing to do with that but I mean
overall these are amazing products you
don't have to spend I love a lot of
high-end products but you don't have to
spend that kind of money on products to
get amazing wear amazing looks amazing
just feels to it it feels good on your
skin so hopefully you enjoyed watching
