going to get ready together so grab your
coffee grab your tea I've got my water
here and let's try some products so some
of these products are brand new to me
that we're I'm trying out for the first
time some of these are products I've
been trying for a few weeks so I've kind
of got my feelings about them kind of
sorted out so the foundation I'm going
to be putting on today is the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer you guys know I'm always up
front with you when I'm being sponsored
and this video is sponsored by Clinique
I've been trying this and a concealer of
theirs out for a few weeks now and I
really like it now I tried this
foundation a while ago but I couldn't
quite get my shade right this is in the
shade 0.5 breeze
they've got 27 shades and I love the doe
foot applicator it makes it so easy to
just throw onto your face without
getting your fingers messy and I like to
blend it with a sponge
do you guys see that coverage are you
freaking kidding me are you kidding me
do you see the coverage and yet it
doesn't feel cakey or heavy it's just
really lightweight for the coverage it
doesn't really make any sense look at
that oh gosh every time I put it on I'm
like floored even more the true test is
my nose is always so red yes oh my gosh
I love it it's exciting to see it in
this lighting too because I'm used to
seeing it you know either in daylight
and it looks so nice but seeing it in my
own filming lighting it it looks nice
this way too and that is like the true
test because sometimes foundations can
look good and real-life and look
terrible on camera this looks good both
ways you can go to any Clinique location
and they'll give you a 10-day supply of
the foundation so you can get your shade
and you can try it out and see how much
you'll love it too
this foundation is $29 which when I
compare that with other more high-end
brands that are like $40 $50 this
performs better and it's cheaper than
those so this has just been such an
exciting fine for me and then the
concealer I wanted to share with you
guys today is there beyond perfecting
super concealer it's got 24-hour wear
and it's a squeezy tube I have it in the
shade very fair 0 - so the way I like to
apply it is just get a little bit on tap
it between my fingers and then just kind
of apply you don't need a lot that was
like a tiny amount and you'll see how
much it spreads out I mean this
concealer is gonna last me forever
look at how brightening look at the
coverage and what I love about this is
it really doesn't crease a lot and
that's hard to find for me I've got fine
lines that just won't quit and I know
I'm not alone I know a lot of you guys
do too cuz you guys asked about that and
this is something that I don't feel like
I need to set and my favorite way to
apply this is obviously with a sponge I
just feel like it spreads it really
nicely any sponge you like you can also
blend it with your fingers if you prefer
I've tried it that way as well and it
works just fine it comes in 18 shades
they also have an apricot
shade for dark circles which I'm really
interested in trying I feel like this
stuff doesn't move and so this is one of
those things that has quickly rose
through the ranks and my concealers
because I don't feel like I need to set
it if I'm in a hurry and I'm tired I
mean right now I'm pregnant and I'm
getting read up early for work still and
you know so I'm tired
I've got dark circles to cover sometimes
I have bags to cover and this does a
great job of really brightening the area
but it stays all day with no powder
needed and I love that so if you're
interested in trying either one of those
products out I will put a link below for
them if you want to check them out
alright so I threw my favorite eye
pencil my brow pencil on the hourglass
arch pencil and ash but I did want to
try out this gel from coqui it's their
eyebrow gel in clear like a brow mascara
so really I don't feel like I need a lot
of control for my brows like I keep them
cut so they don't you know I don't think
they ever crap they don't really look
unruly however this is really like
messing with like it's pulling the color
through but not like in a good way
now I've got like patches that I feel
like I need to fix and I've not ever
experienced that with a clear brow gel
but it did fine on this one so I don't
know that's weird yeah like it's
literally making taking my eyebrow
pencil color and balling it up oh so I
can go ahead and say I really am not
liking this this is the first time I've
experienced that with that and I've used
a lot of clear brow gels with this
particular pencil and I've never had
that problem so I don't feel like it's
the pencil so I'll have to try it one
more time with G's with a different brow
pencil and see if it does the same thing
or maybe I'll try it with a pomade and
I'm gonna try this pixie and Whaley
pixie recently sent these it's they're a
bunch of different collabs but this is
the eyeshadow palette in let's talk eyes
it looks really pretty like really
pretty the swatches are gorgeous but I'm
excited to see how it truly wears on the
eyes so I'm gonna start with this kind
of MIDI medium medium brown and just
kind of so I'm trying it with them
without
I always like to see how the shadows
look without it this is a Catrice primer
that I'm talking about for another video
today the prime and fine brightening
eyeshadow base and so I'm always curious
with how it looks on top of something
like that and I'm just throwing some
wet-and-wild Brule on top because it
always sets it really nicely and I'm
even gonna kind of throw that on top of
what I've already applied cuz as I
started to apply it I realize you know
what it's sticking in certain areas and
I don't want to assume that's the fault
of the actual show so now that we're a
little more even now I know you guys I'm
sure the scientist out there like
Jessica you have too many variables
going on I know
so yeah it's blending a lot better now
that I'm doing it my kind of traditional
route so I'm just throwing this into the
crease I tend to really like pixie
eyeshadows you seem to blend nice their
mats are always really nice their
shimmers are also very nice let's throw
a little bit more over here I said nice
so many times I'm gonna put this shimmer
on this kind of pinkish shimmer it's so
pretty I'm saying I'm gonna keep this
eye shadow look simple and then I always
end up making it more complicated it
doesn't kick up a ton of powder but it
does kick up a little but not nothing
crazy so I'm gonna take kind of a
smaller brush and go back into that
medium brown just to kind of clean up
the crease now that I've thrown the
shimmer in there and then I'm gonna take
the shimmer like kind of almond color
and put that on my brow bone whoa oh I
might have to blend that with maybe my
wet and wild brulee that packs quite a
punch
I knew it did but sometimes it'll kind
of oh wow that's frosty that is some
frosty the snowman snowman stuff right
there I'm just gonna grab this kind of
tones it down this is that wet and wild
brulee I love kind of blends and tones
it down just a tinge but enough that you
can still see it through because I do
like that it's definitely a look that
you either like or you don't
I don't mind it I think it's nice but
that was a lot so on my lower lashline
I'm just gonna take a smaller brush and
I'm still gonna I'm just gonna use that
same brown we're gonna keep it simple
like I already said so I wanted to try
before I put liner on this other product
from wet and wild it's one other I see
I'm sure this is limited edition it's
their liquid cat suit liquid eyeshadow
in the shade pure intention it's just a
really glittery kind of a kind of cream
shadow somewhat see-through but I'm just
gonna Pat that onto the lid it's very
very glittery but it does seem to stick
pretty well I haven't noticed a lot of
fallout with this I've noticed a little
bit but nothing so much that I'm like oh
it would prevent me from using it do I
think it's the best creamy liquid type
glitter shadow out there not necessarily
but I think it's bad No
so if you find a shade you're really you
know fiending for I'd say go for it
because it definitely adds a nice
shimmer and it's packs a decent punch so
I'm using this is newer to me they
recently sent me these these is the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil it's
been years since I've tried one of these
so I wanted to try one again this is in
the shade zero it's just their standard
black
very very black very very creamy it
reminds me like it drugstore wise NYX
makes the slide on glide on eye pencils
that feel the same they really do and
Milani makes one that's really really
good as well I can link both of those
below if you want a cheaper option
because I don't think you need to spend
that much on this do I think it's nice
will I use it yeah but do I think you
really need to spend as much not
necessarily so today I'm gonna try well
it's very dirty I've been using this for
about a month now but I realized I
hadn't really shown it on camera I've
talked about it a bit on snapchat but
this is the Maybelline total temptation
mascara a lot of people are raving about
it I like it is it my favorite mascara
no but do I still really like it yeah
there's a reason it's so dirty I've been
using it so I've already combed through
and curled my lashes I think this does a
good job of separating lashes
it definitely blackens them and it holds
a curl pretty well do I think it's the
most volumizing formula no and that's
why it'll never be like my favorite cuz
volume I need volume and curl are kind
of my two number ones with mascara I'm
holding a curl and then volumizing so
the it kind of lengthens but again
that's not a strength either but it
doesn't at least it hasn't yet it
doesn't seem to have a lot of like
little black speckles on my cheekbone
throughout the day it doesn't do that to
me
now I'm sure as it gets older it will so
there you can see that's one coat I mean
you guys see me apply mascara like a
maniac I put tons of coats on but
essentially the first coat of it
compared to nothing I mean it's okay
okay so that's the completed eye look I
might take a little bit of one of the
shimmer shades and throw it in like the
inner corner I might use that kind of
more almond shade right there and just
kind of put a little bit there just a
little bit of brightness I don't like a
lot there for myself um so I've already
put on a bronzer I used my Catrice
sculpting glow I can link below
I've been using this for a long time
I've talked about it a lot but I love it
so for the blush I also grabbed another
pixie product this is the pixie and
Chloe Murillo one and it's got shadows
in it brow products but I just wanted to
try these blushes but I'll show you in
swatches you can see all of them I
thought that the shadows they were okay
I think the shadows in this one were
better quality and then the brow powders
for just standard brow powders I didn't
find anything wrong with them but for
the blush I'm going to use this kind of
peachy tone since I've got kind of a
little bit of warmth to my eyes so I'll
use a warmer blush
pretty isn't it I like that color so
again nicely pigmented nothing too crazy
where it's gonna be difficult to apply
like I find that sleek blushes can be
difficult to apply from time to time
because they're so so pigmented these
are nicely pigmented but they're usable
so for highlight I wanted to try this
profusion highlight palette now this is
the first time I'm actually putting on
my face but I did swatch it for the
close-ups and in the swatches I was very
unimpressed I really really was I was
ready to like this I've tried some other
profusion products and I've liked a lot
of them but this particular highlight
palette I don't know so I'm gonna use
the shade dreamy here it's kind of the
lightest shade and just see actually
that looks nice
see don't judge a book by it's cover
Jessie girl it actually does look nice
it's a it definitely has a little bit of
a punch but it's nothing crazy again
totally my cup of tea but if you wanted
something super Wow
I mean you could probably keep building
this up and get it there I don't feel
the need to actually I really didn't
think I liked it I am kind of blown away
you're seeing my honest like reaction to
this Wow so color me surprised I really
like that Wow I mean what do you guys
think do you see what I'm saying like
it's got a punch but it's still kind of
like a dimly lit thing - ooh alright the
last thing I wanted to try is this okay
so PopSugar if you've heard of the
website and stuff they now have a beauty
line did they have one before I feel
like it's new but it's the beauty by pop
sugar lipgloss and be the boss this is
my first time trying this and it felt
very sticky swatching it I mean it's got
you know a slight amount of color I feel
like I had to keep
dipping to get like anything out I like
the color though although really I feel
like it's just emphasizing my own lip
color I don't know how much it's really
changing smells good
smells kind of sweet like vanilla which
I like it's like hard to apply do you
see me like surely I mean you need to
dip in a lot it's a very sticky thin
formula but I have to admit I like the
ending look so it doesn't feel too
sticky on though this is weird but I
liked it and I will say when I first got
this I was like squeezy tube lip gloss
like I'm not a big fan but then I open
it and I'm like yes but again you just
have to keep going at it over and over
again at least with this shade Oh so the
shade of this by the way is time after
time so the last thing I wanted to do
I'm a little nervous to do it cuz I have
to film a lot today and I'm like but
this is the elf active post-workout
cool-down miss now the only reason I
wanted to try this here is because it
said you can use it just to set your
makeup it's not necessarily just for
after workout and it's been sitting in
its packaging unused for a while and so
I wanted to try it so Wow the mister
seems really nice I might okay that's a
stellar mister again this is one that
I'll have to update you as I do with all
of these kinds of videos I try to do an
update video like a month or so from now
to let you know how these products now
that I've been using them longer work of
course some of these I have been using
for a bit like the mascara the
foundation and concealer I'd already
used the urban decay liner before but
anyway so that one hat this has a good
smell to it as well so all in all I feel
like these were a lot of good products
some that really surprised me and some
that I'm just gonna have to keep trying
out to let you know but I was excited to
support some fellow youtubers and some
of their collabs that have come out and
again thanks clinic for sponsoring this
video and if your interests
any of the products I mentioned I will
have them listed down below for your
reference but other than that I hope you
enjoyed and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
