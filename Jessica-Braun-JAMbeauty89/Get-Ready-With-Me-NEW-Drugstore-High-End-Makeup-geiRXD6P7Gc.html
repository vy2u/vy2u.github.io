are going to get ready together and it
is a day that are not working so this
Sun is actually up while I'm getting
ready which is such a nice change so I'm
gonna put my little headband on and
we're gonna get ready together I've
already moisturized my face today I just
wanted to try hey but this is like too
tight is my head getting bigger Oh
anyway I wanted to try some new products
some of these are products I have been
trying for a while and then some of them
are newer to me so it's kind of just a
mixed bag but I like doing these once or
twice a month just to chat with you guys
and get ready together as the title
would suggest I'm always up front with
you guys when a video is sponsored and
this is sponsored by Physicians Formula
I'm actually only using one of their
products it's their butter collection
pallet is anyone like I love the butter
blushes I love the butter bronzers and
so the fact that they have a palette now
and it has a perfume and a highlighter
in it is so exciting inside note the
perfume it's an Eau de Toilette and it's
a spray and it is literally it smells
like the butter bronzer but just a
little bit sweeter it smells amazing so
if you've loved that kind of beachy
coconutty amazing smell you will love
this anyway so I will talk about that
here in a bit when I get to getting
ready with it but I wanted to mention it
now just so you're aware cuz I don't
want to I don't want you to feel
sideswipe like oh my gosh is a sponsor I
didn't find out ten minute ten any you
but let's start at the beginning of my
face so like I said I've already
moisturized and put some eye cream on
some lip balm but the primer I wanted to
try out today I've only used this once
or twice it is a it's from it Kannur ipk
in I'm not sure it's their radiant cream
primer it has SPF of 15 let's it's a
squeezy bottle Hey
just kind of like a white semi
iridescent cream and I just really
lightly put that over my moisturizer I
liked this the few times I've used it so
far because it is so I don't know just
it is a light and airy but it's still
creamy and it has this quality to it
that is
definitely iridescent but not glittery
you know what I mean so and then really
most primers aren't glittery thank
goodness but I just I really liked the
way my skin looks with this even if like
I've put this on one of the times I wore
it I put this on and didn't put anything
else on I was just kind of trying it on
a naked face you know what I mean
and I walked around for a few hours like
that with just this on my skin and my
skin looked so much healthier and glowy
but I didn't have any other coverage on
so it was still kind of nice in that way
so if you're more of a kind of natural
girl or guy and you really just want
that glow but you don't really want
anything else this is actually really
really nice so like I always link all of
the products I mentioned below but this
one I've really been enjoying but I'm
trying a new foundation boy everyone
talks about this this is the Laura
Mercier flawless fusion ultra long wear
foundation everyone seems to be loving
this and I'm like we're gonna see
because I feel like even though my dry
skin is not nearly as bad as it used to
be like a year or two ago I've really
got it under control I feel like but
really high coverage foundations I
really struggle to find ones that work
well with my skin I've only tried this
once I already have some thoughts but I
figure okay let's try this second time
when I use this yesterday I used it with
the Beca first light primer I really
like this primer
however it's not super glowy it's more
low-key which I do like with most
foundations but with this I didn't like
the way they work together so today like
I said I'm trying to put that radiant
cream primer and I think that would be a
better base for this kind of a
foundation so does have a pump and I
have it in the shade one into Vanille
it's a little yellow for me but once I
got it on yesterday it worked so it
might seem quite yellow as we first
apply it but it'll look fine so ooo I
wanted to apply the no pore bloom primer
to my nose because this is new to me
it's from the brand touch insole again I
this one's semi raged about on YouTube
but I'm just gonna kind of tap this into
my nose area because I know I've got
pores to fill and I figure maybe this
will
better in those areas with a more pore
filling primer so I'm kind of getting
around my nose and just pressing it in
lightly okay so while that's kind of
setting I'm gonna start on my cheek so
I'm just using my L'Oreal sponge that I
love and what I noticed like I said it
is a bit yellow but what I noticed is
that it's very it covers with a very
thin layer and that really impressed me
but it was the way it wore throughout
the day on my skin I was not loving it
so that's kind of the downside it made
my skin look really dry and again it
could have been the primer I was pairing
it with and that's why I was excited to
try it with a different primer today one
that I know I'm already liking I've
heard that a lot of these tones a lot of
the shades lean kind of yellow I might I
don't know I don't know if I like this
enough to try for another shade you know
what I mean because if I'm not like in
the formula then the shades not gonna
matter you know but that was one layer
and I feel like you can really see the
difference of the coverage
so face is covered one layer I think I'm
gonna I'm I don't need to do a second
layer for the amount of coverage I need
this really is a high coverage
foundation and when I layered it on a
second layer yesterday it I mean it amps
up the coverage even more because I've
got little bits of freckles but I don't
mind seeing those so if you're really in
the market for a high high coverage
foundation but that is a little bit
thinner I think you'd like this you know
there are a lot of high coverage
foundations that are more whipped or
just thicker and like I know I don't
like those so I think if I were reaching
for one this isn't horrible but for me
it's almost more of a special event
makeup because in person I don't think
it has the look that I like my
foundation to have even when freshly
applied it's just a little bit cakey in
certain areas and I'm gonna keep messing
with it I'm not gonna give up on it that
quickly I don't think this is the most
perfect foundation in the world for me
but that's just my two cents let's keep
rolling
so for concealer I'm trying a really
expensive one I've been using this for a
while now and if you've watched my
snapchat I've snapped about it a couple
times this is the clay 2po concealer it
was a Holy Grail concealer of like Elle
Fowler back in the day on YouTube she's
also pregnant right now but it's a stick
concealer and I have not had a ton of
experience with stick concealers but one
thing I realized this is probably I've
been using this for a couple weeks so
this is probably my like tenth time
using this I realized it's a little bit
easier for me to apply it with my finger
than it is for me to go in with the
stick so I'm just gonna place this can
already see the coverage in the areas I
am my circles are the darkest if you
will and I have this in the shade I
think I have the lightest shade ivory
I'm not sure if that's the lightest but
it's I think it's close the thing about
this is it's very creamy for a stick
concealer it's not a super dry formula
however it is still naturally drier than
a liquid concealer would be I mean that
makes sense right but what I like about
this stuff is that it really does stay
in place I try not to get too much of it
in where my fine lines began I've
already gotten some in there but the
reason being that I don't
this this still sinks into fine lines
you know and I can set it and I will
today just so you can kind of see and so
I can brighten the whole area together
but I feel like while it is nice and I
do like it and I will definitely use
this up I mean this is very very nice
I don't know that it's worth $100 guys I
mean that's an insane amount if I use
this every single day I would run out of
it so quickly but the nice thing is when
you're applying it with your fingers I
think you use a little bit less at least
I feel like I do and that is kind of
nice
I'll even bring it to like the tip of my
nose where I'm red and just kind of Pat
it in I will also say it's nice because
it's really quick to apply but let me
just show you for example I have to
stick concealers that I think are really
good that are similar so this is the
Neutrogena hydraboost hydrating
concealer and it's got like this core of
moisture in it but it's a really really
creamy like creamier than that I don't
know that I don't think that this stays
in place as well as the clay 2po but I
think it does a pretty darn good job and
it's literally a tenth of the price so
it's like you know how much is it
staying in place really matter to you
when it still sinks into some fine lines
but another one that's a little bit more
expensive but nowhere near 100 is the
match master concealer from Mac it's a
stick as well
it's again I think it's even more
moisturizing than both the clay to poke
and the Neutrogena and so I don't think
I don't feel like it stays in place as
well but it is a really pretty look on
the skin especially if you have really
dry under eyes and this I bought on
HauteLook for like 50% off and it's not
expired I've already checked it's it's
nice so I think if I were recommending
one of the two I'd probably recommend
the Mac one over the Regina I hope all
of that made sense so let's dig into our
butter collection palette so I have the
light/medium version and they also have
the medium deep so the difference
between and I'll show you some close-ups
here the light has the regular butter
bronzer then they also have the blush in
the shade natural glow and then they
have two limited edition highlighter
shades in there there's the more ivory
color highlighter in the shade full moon
and then the high
in galactic which is a lot more punchy
and then like I mentioned earlier it's
got the butter paradise Oh to toilette
oh my gosh
smells maybe I'm about to spray more and
I need to like slow down the other shade
collection they have is the medium to
deep and this one has their deep bronzer
and then they have the blush in the
shade vintage Rouge and then they have
those same two limited-edition
highlighters in their full moon and
galactic and the same butter paradise
perfume so for me I'm gonna opt for the
light/medium of course and I'm gonna try
to apply as much of this as possible so
you can see it I've been messing with
this a lot the past week and I've just
been enjoying it so I'm gonna use kind
of a fluffier brush to apply the bronzer
and I like to tap a little bit off and
then I just kind of you guys know me I'm
kind of a lazy girl with makeup I just
like stuff that works that's quick and
huh it smells so good and I just kind of
lightly dust this in those areas where I
like to throw bronzer the color of this
for my skintone is a really nice kind of
healthy flush of bronzer in my opinion
and that's why I think a lot of people
like this is because the shade and the
formula together are really nice it
stays on really well throughout the day
there's a reason it's become kind of a
cult classic and these by the way are
sold at Walmart so now I'm gonna put on
the shade the blush and natural glow
with my blush brush so again I'm gonna
tap off some excess this looks like a
really nice I love this and this stayed
on really well the other day I was
looking in the mirror after work and I
was like dang you're saying that stayed
on really really nicely and it just got
this really nice peachy flush and it's
not glittery but it has this really
pretty satin Sheen to it which is my
preferred finish of a foundation so for
the highlighter oh my gosh let me just
show you some swatch of these are you
kidding me so we've got full moon there
and then galactic on the other side
these are ridiculous they're so creamy
and also how if we not talked about how
pretty that is any other so I'm going to
grab a highlighter brush that's a little
bit lighter and I'm gonna opt for full
moon today it seems more my speed and as
I've tried these out I
really oh my gosh I mean oh it's so
pretty
so I'm just kind of placing this on the
tops of my cheekbones throw a little on
the tip of my nose sometimes like
lightly just a little bit up on my
forehead but it has this gorgeous kind
of naughty I don't want to say yellow
tone but a little bit but I feel like it
catches the light so beautifully
I'll even pull a little bit on to the
apples of my cheeks just to kind of amp
that part up - these are limited edition
by the way so I would predict that these
will probably sell out quickly so it's
something that you really want to keep
your eyes peeled for if you know you're
interested in this because the butter
collection just in general is a very
popular collection and I think that this
is something that I could see selling
out and then you can't find so if you're
really interested in it definitely hop
out to Walmart and check it out okay so
I just toss on my brows which I always
use not always I often use the hourglass
arch brow pencil in the shade ash so I
just tossed that on my brows and then
the uLTA Beauty matte eye primer I'm
running low on it's my favorite so I
just put that on my eyes but before I
did my eye shadow I wanted to show you
I've had some people asking me to apply
this this is the Charlotte Tilbury oh my
gosh airbrushed flawless finish powder I
use it for my under eyes so I keep it
with my concealers a lot of you guys
watched my face powder collection
declutter and I was kind of curating my
collection I have like 25 powders and I
only ended up keeping like I don't know
six or something like that
but anyway a lot of you guys might
where's that sure that Tilbury powder
mic don't worry girls it is in my
concealer drawer it's not going anywhere
this is the best best best under-eye
powder ever ever ever I like I love it
so much so because I told you that
concealer really settles into fine lines
I like to get some of this and just kind
of tap it into that area and it
brightens it helps it not fall into
those fine lines as easily it's not
nothing I've ever found is completely
foolproof but it does a great job and
it's not quite as cakey as like a looser
powder or other you know thicker like
powder
nations or anything this is really thin
powder and really brightening I
personally have it in the shade number
one fair worth every penny will
repurchase it because I will definitely
run out of this like I literally it is
so flippin amazing
I'll link it below okay so now that face
basically is done we're just gonna focus
on the eyes so I'm gonna try out this
Urban Decay they sent this to me the
beached eyeshadow palette so the shades
are they're really pretty but again it's
that same warm palette you're seeing
everywhere with little bits of blue but
it is really pretty so do I think many
other palettes are kind of the same set
up yes does that mean this is a bad
product not necessarily so this surely
is the first impressions because I have
never tried this so the packaging is
kind of interesting it it's kind of like
that paper II cardboard stuff I don't
know but it's pretty to look at let's
give it a try so I'm going to like I
said I've already primed my eyes so I'm
gonna take this shade and salt just more
of like an almond D shade and just kind
of oh it's a little bit more shimmery
than I anticipated it's pretty on the
brow bone though so I'm just kind of
putting it everywhere someone the other
day was like they watched a video of
mine and I blew on my palette or brush
and that's totally just something I do I
know it's not a great habit but it's
just what I do and it's almost like oh
my gosh did you seriously just blow on
your brush look I know it's insane it's
really hard to believe but I did okay
there are bigger problems in the world
okay anyway so these these are some
pretty shades so I'm torn about what
exactly I want to do I think I want to
do some of this blue like on the lower
lash line or something instead of just
all over the lid like I'm kind of drawn
to do I think I want to do something a
little different but I'm gonna put some
of this blaze shade on my lid it's kind
of a light goal just kind of tap it
there it's a really pretty shade this
one's really pigmented it's kind of a
shade I feel like you don't might sound
crazy but I feel like I don't see this
shade often it's like a it's almost got
a pinky iridescent quality to it at the
same time as it's like a pale gold
alright so now I'm gonna
take a little bit more of a detail brush
and get this shade daybreak which is a
matte I'm gonna actually tap some of
that off because that's a lot just kind
of focused that in the crease a little
bit in the outer corner it's a nice
shade cuz it's not too dark but it's not
too light either it really does define
nicely and then I can blend it out here
in a second
a little bit better so now I'm gonna go
back with that salt color and kind of
help that use that to kind of blend the
edges of this a little bit not really
any fallout from this which is nice I
feel like most of the palettes I use
nowadays have that fallout where I feel
like oh I should have done my eyes
before my face or oh I need to clean it
up but so far only use three shades but
there wasn't really any fallout so I'm
gonna take a little bit of this 16th
Street shade which is like this deeper
gold on a brush and kind of Pat that
towards the from the middle to the outer
corner a little bit deeper than I
thought but it's pretty I have a bronzy
gold ooh that had fallout see Jess you
should have blown on it I'm gonna take
some more of that blaze color from
earlier and kind of blend it into that
gold bronze shade so as promised I want
to take this brighter blue shade double
dip and I'm going to use the thinner
brush and I'm gonna get some of that on
kind of more of an eyeliner shaped
angled brush and I'm just gonna press
that into my lower lash line see how it
looks it's definitely a nice bright blue
doing blue on the lower lash line is
such an easy way to throw some color in
without like really fully committing to
anything you know these the second I
throw some blue on my lid it's like we
are doing a blue eye you know what I
mean
but this is a really simple quick way to
do that it doesn't really take a lot of
talent and it'll look better once I get
some more liner on the top and stuff
like that but um actually know if I'm
saying that maybe I'll use this deeper
color plunge and line my upper lid with
that just to see how that looks
like is it deep enough I don't know that
it is yeah I don't love that I'm gonna
go you can kind of see it I could
continue doing it would look for ID but
I think I just want to go with a black
on the top today to kind of counteract
that blue but you could totally do that
as well so verdict on this I think it
blended really really nicely I think it
was more pigmented than a lot of like I
don't know urban decay lately has been
very hit-or-miss with their shadows like
especially their shimmers they do so
well in the naked palettes and then
they'll come up with other palettes and
I'll swatch them and I'm like why aren't
they using the same formula it's like so
this was a step in the right direction I
think for them so if these colors are
screaming out to you then it might be
worth it if they're not it's not worth
it so if you need me to tell you not to
go buy it just because it's new don't go
buy it because it's new really only buy
it if you're like wow I would use every
shade in that alright so I finished my
eyes I ended up lining if you're just
curious these are products I've been
loving for a while this is the L'Oreal
infallible long-wear eye pencil such a
creamy eyeliner standard black but I
love it it's it's so so good it's in its
drugstore they say especially for the
drugstore but frankly the drugstore
makes really good eye Finers and then
also drugstore the NYX epic ink liner is
how I did my wing and just kind of
blackened everything and then the
mascara I threw on is my favorite the
essence lash princess mascara this is
like two or three coats but I love it
and it's like five dollars so the last
thing I wanted to try today I've been
using for the past two weeks
it's Urban Decay chill makeup setting
spray I don't remember if this is the
new package or if this is the old and
the reason I say that is cuz I also
bought this on HauteLook for like 50%
off so it was half the price as normal
whole look is linked to Nordstrom Rack
so like makeup you can find at Nordstrom
Rack for 50% off you can also find on
hooks website because they're like the
same anyway
so I've been loving this when I have a
really matte foundation on like I do I
feel like it helps it kind of sink
together into my skin so and it just
feels so good I put way too much I'm
gonna feel so good alright for my lips
I'm going to put on the L'Oreal color
riche matte lip liner in the shade
I've been using this a while this
formula is so so so good
it's so creamy easy to sharpen and then
the lipstick I'm trying I just bought
this from Sephora this is the Kat Von D
studded kiss cream lipstick in lovecraft
I've never tried any of these it look
like a really pretty pink oh yeah so
without really meaning to that lip liner
and lipstick combo created a really nice
ombre effect on my lips didn't even know
that it would I honestly thought these
would match better but yeah but I think
it looks nice too I love it with this
eye look I'm not so sure but I just
wanted to try this lipstick out so I
figure in for the sake of science I will
try it on um we'll see I'm gonna try
this and just see kind of how it wears
but I figured the mac lipglass and
cultured would look really pretty over
it but I kind of want to leave it the
way it is so that is all that I wanted
to try with you guys today thanks again
to Physicians Formula for sponsoring
this video and like I said if you're
interested in the butter collection
palette definitely check it out at
Walmart and I'm excited about it I love
all of those products and I feel like
they look really nice and they last
really well throughout the day so other
than that I will have links to
everything I mentioned down below as
well and if you enjoyed I hope you'll
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
