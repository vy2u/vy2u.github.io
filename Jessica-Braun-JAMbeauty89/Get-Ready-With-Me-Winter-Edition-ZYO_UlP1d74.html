sharing with you guys first of all look
at my adorable mug thank you to the
lovely subscriber that sent this to me I
love it anyway today we're gonna do just
like a chatty get ready with me kind of
winter theme some of these products or
products I love to use in the winter
because I do have dry skin and some
products I'm trying out our newer
products to me some of them are old
favorites so let's go ahead and get into
so this video is actually sponsored by
origins you guys know I'm always open
with you guys when I'm being sponsored
I've worked with them before and I
really I like this company I've tried so
many other products and I've loved every
single one but the one I'm using today
for my primer is the origins original
skin pore perfecting cooling primer
this has willow-herb and what I love
about it and this is crazy it is it's
the craziest feeling when you put it on
your skin let me roll the sleeves up so
you kind of shake it up it's really
lightweight and moussey and it's it's
like a mousse and when you put it on
your face it is the coldest most
refreshing thing you will ever feel but
what's weird about it and the reason I
was like what is this magical product is
it has that kind of moosie texture but
once you start actually spreading it out
over your skin it's so like pore filling
and moisturizing and like how does it
turn from that like lightweight mousse
that's crazy cooling to this really nice
moisturizing primer it's the crazies I
even put it on my under eye cuz I feel
like it fills in that area really nicely
just everywhere it feels so good you
guys this is one of those products that
like it kind of changed the game for me
because it wakes me up my skin loves it
it actually acts as a primer I don't
need any other primer with it not even
anything on my nose and you guys know I
have a lot of redness on my nose and I
always feel like primers can be weird
this is not weird because it does have
that moisturizing quality and pore
filling quality so obsessed with it I've
also been using from the same line when
I take my makeup off at nighttime oh my
it's like it's close to being gone
it is the origins original skin
cleansing
removing jelly these both have
willow-herb in it
I love the cleansing makeup removing
jelly because it it's fragrance free
first of all which I appreciate because
a lot of the kind of similar products
I've used from other brands have do have
fragrance in it so I really liked it's
fragrance free but it does a really good
job it's really gentle but it does
remove like waterproof makeup everything
and so I've really been loving this and
I like that it's in a squeezy tube and
not like in a big pot where you have to
dig your fingers in so I've been loving
this as well and they're from that same
line and if you recall in previous
videos I talked about the origins
original skin matte moisturizer I love
that stuff - same line this whole
original skin line is really nice so
that is on my face it doesn't take long
to sink in and you can go right in with
foundation or BB cream or whatever
you're putting on you could wear it
alone I feel like it helps kind of even
my skin tone out so if you're interested
in any of the origins products that I
mentioned definitely check the link
below to check it out today I'm gonna be
putting on the covergirl vitalist
healthy elixir and I feel like I need to
like get my collar out of the way there
I have it in the shade 710 it has a
little bit of SPF in it but I'm gonna
use my L'Oreal sponge my favorite kind
of Pat it out on my hand and then just
start going in this stuff is nice cuz
it's got some coverage it's certainly
not a full coverage foundation but it's
got enough that for most days especially
in the winter I feel like it's good it's
a good amount of coverage for my skin
now if you've got big problem areas you
might need a little more than this you
might want to layer more on you might
not even like this foundation at all but
I really like it I feel like it's a very
kind of natural looking foundation you
know I could go a shade lighter in this
at least in person like looking in the
mirror I'm like um I feel like I could
go later this looks a little yellow but
we will make it work for today I do have
my cover FX custom cover drops which is
a really it's a really light shade that
I own so I could lighten this but now
it's too late too late just should have
thought of that sooner
I'm gonna use my favorite concealer the
Ulta complete coverage no full coverage
liquid concealer I just love this stuff
it's it's very kind of moosie and
whipped as well it's
really quickly it sinks into my fine
lines the least if that makes sense you
know compared to other concealers and I
appreciate that because I've got a lot
of fine lines that you know are just
always showing through but I feel like
it's brightening I just I don't know I
feel like my undereyes like it does that
make sense has anyone else tried this
stuff I always feel like I look a little
crazy right after concealer like way too
bright but it'll all kind of blend
sometimes I'll take if there's any
concealer left on the sponge I'll just
kind of take it down my nose and up to
the center of my forehead I don't know
that it really makes a difference but I
like to think it does Nami all right so
love that I'm gonna set it this is newer
to me this is the elf little like
concealer like mineral concealer I don't
know what they actually call it of
course it doesn't say but it's on it's
in the shade banana so it's a kind of
brightening yellow tone so I'm just
gonna get a little bit of that it's a
loose powder on the sponge and just kind
of set this area not true baking or
anything but just it's okay I don't
think I love it I think this stuff and
that's kind of why I wanted to show you
guys on camera I think it ages me a
little bit more so than like I have a
laura mercier secret brightening powder
that's even thinner and it'll kind of
cover that area and really brighten but
it's so thin that it doesn't make me
look older than I am and I feel like
this stuff does so I've been trying it
for a few weeks now but I kind of wanted
to I don't know I kind of wanted to try
it again just to see but it really kind
of emphasizes my fine line thanks elf
sheesh oftentimes I'll stop at this
point before doing the rest of my face
and go ahead and do my eyes but let me
do my brows first because I do typically
do that I'm just using the pretty vulgar
like little brow pencil I think they
call it their eyebrow pencil and I have
the shade quick wit so I just use the
spoolie to brush it out and then just
fill them in
so the primer I've been using recently
is the Smashbox lid primer in white I
really like that it's got a doe foot
applicator and that really does whiten
the area obviously if you have a deeper
skin tone this would actually still work
it would just look a lot whiter you know
what I mean because it's such a contrast
to your skin tone but it does such a
nice job of whatever shadow you put on
top of it it really makes it pop and
it's not so stark white like the NYX
pencil in milk and sometimes look a
little bit too why even though I do
really like that stuff so one tip I
always give is to really make sure you
blend the primer in the corners because
it can look really weird any primer any
eye primer I use how quick right so I am
torn because I want to use this a little
bit more this is the new wet and wild
palette in Rose a all day no rose a in
the air because they've added transition
shades to it and well if I added I mean
they didn't even have this palette I
don't know why but they added transition
shades to all of their palettes because
they'd heard everyone kind of
complaining about that like man I love
these colors the shadows are amazing but
we need transition shades so this one
does have some but I also want to use my
favorite palette the violet Voss holy
grail that I never would have thought I
would have loved as much as I freaking
do maybe I'll pull some from this but I
think I'm just gonna stick with the
white wow let's give it a try I also
pulled out the wet and wild single their
new single in brulee very similar I mean
there's a slight shade difference but
this is way more pigmented so what I
like to do is just grab a bill fluffy
brush and with the primer on I like to
just grab it's so ridiculously pigmented
I like to just kind of set the primer
with this kind of a it's so powder it
kicks up a lot of power like way more
than the other now the reality is it's
not that big of a deal but I feel like
I'm gonna wear through this really
quickly because it's so much powder the
second your brush touches it but again
it's like a dollar ninety-nine so it's
like I'm alright with that
alright so I'm gonna go in with let's do
the cooler transition shade today
I love that they've redone palates
they've come out with new ones I'm just
gonna kind of put this obviously in the
crease nothing too fancy as usual but
the colorways they've come up with are
really cool like they redid their
comfort zone palette and added some
transition shades I do think that the
formula it has been changed a bit but I
don't think like not for the worst like
I think it's still good I do think it's
just a little bit different still
testing them all out you know deciding
how I feel about him so that blended
really really nicely really really
easily which I also appreciate sometimes
when you have drugstore transition
shades or you know kind of like these
medium tones they can get skippy and
weird and I do find that by setting your
primer with like another eyeshadow first
it really helps to eliminate that skip
enos or wear like some shadowy darker in
some area and you didn't want it to be
that way that's because it's sticking to
certain areas of your primer I'm just
now realizing there really is like a
brulee like shade right there and I
probably could have just used instead of
that but anyway um so let's go in with
the more well let's throw something on
the lid let's throw this like cute
little kind of gold shimmer onto the lid
I just like to do lid work with my
finger I just feel like it does the best
in any brand high-end cheap I feel like
every brand shimmery shadows go on so
much better with your finger unless
you're doing like a wet brush technique
you know where you really want it this
is not like a see from space kind of a
shimmer eyeshadow it's just kind of a
light shimmer and for everyday I
actually really like that I know that's
not everyone's cup of tea some people
really want it to be like the volume I'm
just kind of cleaning up the edges there
so now I'm gonna go in with a more
detail brush and let's get a deeper
shade let's go for let's go for this
kind of red you guys see that this looks
pretty
just kind of on the outer corner and
into the crease I always laugh when I'm
like doing looks and I start putting
bold colors in because like for me I'm
like okay I know what I'm doing today
and it involves laundry and what else
I'm washing my makeup brushes and
starting to pack for our trip you might
be seeing this we might already be on
our trip but it's just funny because I'm
like look at this nice bowl look I'm
just gonna be around the house I think
it's kind of fun though good for you
like if you do your makeup when you're
at home like usually if I'm just at home
like I'm probably not doing my makeup
but good for you if you're one of those
people that you're like you know what
I'm worth it and just because I'm around
the house I'm gonna do my makeup anyway
I think that's so cool
I want to be more like that even though
I know my skin appreciates the break you
know what I mean but at the same time
I'm like I do feel so much more like put
together when I have some makeup on
I feel like anyway so it's awesome if
you do that good for you so I'm kind of
blending it in yeah actually a lot more
color than I would have guessed to be
honest so I'm gonna go back in with this
kind of cooler transition shade and just
kind of help to blend it together you
know is this something that's gonna be
like comparable to I don't know like the
Urban Decay Naked palette that's always
the one cuz that's like the original you
know really good palette at least said
in most people's opinion
I don't know but I think Li these are
easier to work with for me I'm not a
professional makeup artist I screw
things up and so when it's pigmented but
not insanely pigmented it's just easier
to work with and for me I'm learning
myself and I'm learning that I just
prefer that yes I love swatching an
amazing palette being like wow look at
these ridiculous swatch is it so
beautiful and I love that but at the
same time it's like but then I don't
appreciate I don't like putting it on
because it's more work because I'm just
not that good at makeup you know what I
mean okay so that again I think that
blended pretty darn nicely so I do want
to put something on my brow bone I'm
gonna use that kind of light ivory shade
and just put it oh that is that's
lighter this is lighter than brulee
again it kicks up a lot of powder
so now I'm gonna wipe off my fluffy
brush and just kind of lightly blend
that area so it doesn't look like a
totally stark difference um and for my
lower lash line I find my favorite brush
yes and I'm gonna go in with that I'm
actually gonna go in with the darker
Brown right there I sometimes will do
red on my lower lash line but sometimes
I feel like that makes my eyes look
tired
so even when I do like more of a burnt
red look on my eyes I don't always like
to put that on my lower lash in some
people it looks really nice so I'm like
if you have like really green eyes I
think it really emphasizes the green I
just feel like my under eyes look so dry
because of that powder I really regret
it
alright sorry to sweat here so I'm gonna
I'll quickly line my eyes I do a
three-set method where I tight line with
my with a like a regular liner like a
pencil liner and sometimes that tight
line becomes like a full line because
you messed up like I just did and you
just need to fill in the gaps so okay
that's what we're doing so I've lined my
eyes with the hourglass 1.5 millimeter
and I'm usually I'll do like a gel liner
on top but I don't always so I'm just
gonna go in with the liquid liner to
create just a little mini wing alright
so I like to do my mascara really
quickly and then I go in with my face so
I'm using my voluminous last paradise
from is it Maybelline no it's L'Oreal I
don't know why I couldn't remember that
this is my favorite lash curler it's
from Sephora I will link it below no
sorry tweezerman I think it's from
support its the tweezer mint it's like a
wider one so she had like wider eyes it
gets every single hair I'm freakin
obsessed with it it's the only eyelash
girl I've ever used that I like cared
about but I'm like oh my gosh so this
lash paradise is my favorite it adds so
much volume and curl right away it stays
that way all day but it does dry out
really quickly so it is my favorite but
I feel like I have to rebuy it all the
freakin time gosh I love this mascara
but I don't love it on my lower lash
line
using my pixie lower lash mascara just
down there there's the Clinique bottom
lash mascara very similar the it
cosmetics tightline they're all the
exact same thing I mean like almost
non-existent non-existent bristles it's
just like so tiny so it's really easy to
get really particular with your lashes
down there and really you could use this
on your upper lashes too it really
separates and defines so if you like
that you'd probably like a mascara like
this not bad for a mostly drugstore look
I'm just saying just saying alright so
for my face I'm gonna first cover my
face in the Laura Mercier candle glow
shear perfecting powder
I usually just grab a big old fluffy
brush and just kind of put it up in my
forehead on my nose
this adds like this gorgeous glow that I
just love I feel like it makes your skin
look like airbrushed but like there's
just a little glow about it and I think
that's so pretty and so rare to find and
a powder mmm love love love um so I'm
gonna put some bronzer on I was going to
use my hoola kwikki contour stick but
now that I've already powdered I don't
like to do it on top of powder cuz what
I would do is just kind of apply a
little and then use my sponge to blend
it maybe I'll try it I kind of want you
guys to see it how it works so I just
put a little bit of course no my hairs
in it I just kind of blend that area
it's not as easy to do or powder which
is why I didn't want to do it but you
see how it like kind of natural that
look I mean is natural is a contour can
look I guess yeah I really I just love
the way that looks so I'll put a little
bit up here so you can see it I really
don't do a lot cuz I don't you know I
don't know I don't really feel like I
need a ton of bronzer all the time and I
don't wear it every single day but this
stuff I feel like just looks so natural
that I'm like oh my gosh I just love it
and frankly when I heard about this
coming out I was like no thanks
like it doesn't sound like it'd be
something I like jokes on me I freaking
love it right so for blush I'm using a
very wintry shade this is NARS is blush
and sin it's a very very deep kind of
raisin colored blush and so I like to
use a do
fiber brush because that kind of can
help dispense it more evenly and so I
even wipe a little bit bit of it off you
can just throw it on just like that I
feel like it's um you know nice and I
don't know I just think feel like it's a
nice color and it's funny cuz what if I
would have looked at this in the pan I
would've been like no way too dark for
me but you could totally make it work
so for highlight I've been wanting to
show you guys the Fenty Beauty kilowatt
duo illuminator thing in lightning dust
and fire crystal so this one here is a
little bit more like matte radiant you
guys know what I mean like satin um so
I'm gonna throw a little bit of that
just kind of in those regions cuz it's
it's definitely a highlighter but it's
not nearly as crazy as the other side
which I'll show you in a second as well
so I just put it kind of in those areas
my classic highlight areas and then I'm
gonna grab a very detailed brush this is
the Anastasia
a 23 and get the other side the more
shimmery side and just put it in that
Reed I mean come on that's crazy so I
feel like that's still like a strip so I
like to still kind of lightly kind of
melt it into the skin I'm really weird
about highlight I feel like like I don't
like I'd like it to be I'm like I like
that I think that's pretty but I don't
like it to literally look like a line I
know some people are into that I am just
not though this is the completed look I
like kind of looking around I had men to
cover my little blemishes but honestly I
don't really mind them as I look at them
like you know that one maybe I could
have you can still seal it but it
doesn't really bother me that much I've
been covering them so much and if you're
just curious what I usually used to
cover them with this is the mac studio
finish concealer duo and I'll usually
just kind of mix these two because this
is more yellow and this is more cool
I'll just kind of mix them with a brush
and just tap it in that area kind of
blend out the edges around it and then
cover it with like a loose powder like
the Laura Mercier one and it does not
budge it stays on all day I mean it
is amazing but you do have to put that
powder on top to keep the concealer in
place and I think I'd even gotten this
like on HauteLook
for 50% off so I can link that website
below because Mac is on there a lot so
50% off you're gonna notice I didn't put
anything on my lips it's because I don't
usually wear stuff on my lips I really
don't and like when I'm at work I'll see
other women like with you know lipstick
on and I'm like it looks so pretty bit I
don't wear lipstick to work it is so
rare like very very rare I usually just
wear lip balm and so like this cap re
lip glove when I leave the house this is
what I would have on my lips after I
brush my teeth you know what I mean so
I've thought about like grabbing a lip
color putting it on but I was like I
mean if I'm being real with you guys I
wouldn't put anything on my lips like I
do for videos I do when we're going out
everyone saw for work but not typically
and that's just me so and I know I'm not
alone I'm sure a lot of you guys are
like girl saying so I just want to be
real and that's just it's just lip balm
but so if you're interested in the
origins products I mentioned earlier the
original skin pore perfecting cooling
primer or even the cleansing makeup
removing jelly
I keep want to say jello jelly I will
have the link for those down below if
you're interested and I hope that you
guys will subscribe before you leave and
I'll see you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
