going to do a get to know me video
finally and you all sent me so many
questions so many that I had to kind of
Whittle it down and make separate I'm
gonna make separate videos out of some
of them so if you don't hear your
question now just be patient I'm sure
I'll get to it and yes so this will be
my first one first question I get a lot
how old are you I am 24 and it's funny
that you guys are asking me this because
I was at the store the other day with my
boyfriend and I had a bottle of wine in
my hand and a worker rushes over to me
and says umm excuse me you have to be
above the age of 21 to handle the
alcohol so I suggest you put it back and
I was like um I'm 24 years old do you
want to see my ID and he laughed at me
like he didn't believe me and I was like
do you want to see my ID and he was like
oh well I just I had to tell you and it
was just one of those things I was like
there's a way better way to do that it
was just so rude and I was like I'm well
I mean decently above the age of 21 and
even if I did look young like I said
there's a nice way to do that so I was
very upset but yes I'm 24 and my
birthday's in January so I just turned
24 couple months ago what is your
nationality I get that a lot too I'm
just white I mean I I mean my ancestors
came from Ireland and my and that's on
my dad's side they came over during the
Great Potato Famine and like the
mid-1800s I think if that's correct
and so my mother's side we have Cherokee
Indian in us so I don't know it's kind
of an interesting mixture right but I
mean if anyone truly asked like face to
face I'd probably just be like I'm white
I don't know I mean it's so far removed
it's hard to really consider that you
know where do I live I live in Indiana
in the Midwest when oh where have I and
do I go to school I have gone to school
in Chicago and I lived up there for a
couple years for musical theater so I
studied singing dancing and acting and
all kinds of stuff and it was so much
fun I made I met so many wonderful
people that there had wonderful
professors and a great experience but I
just kind of hit the point where I was
like you know it's either this or
something else and I felt that I had
been wanting to teach for a long time
and there were other things going on in
my life as well that you know it all
just kind of
up and so I just made the decision to
leave and the professors are so
understanding wonderful but anyway so
now I'm here and I go to IEP Y which I'm
reppin with my T here
IUPUI and that is basically I'll be
getting my degree from Indiana
University Indiana University Purdue
University Indianapolis
so it's like the Indianapolis campus
sort of kind of hard to explain
but anyway um but yes so I will get my
teaching degree my teaching license for
elementary education a year from now
assuming everything goes smoothly with
student teaching which starts this next
year I'm so excited but um but yeah so I
have one more year so hopefully a year
from this fall I will hopefully have my
own classroom and I just can't wait and
I'm wanting to teach younger like
kindergarten first second or third I
don't really know that I want to go
above that okay let's see when did I
start wearing makeup probably when I did
my first play in the sixth grade and I
just decided to try out for it cuz I was
like I'm not athletic and I did
cheerleading like for a couple years
there but and it was fun but I didn't
want to do it any further but um but
yeah so I trained it for the play and I
got like a little bit part and I had
like one line and you know but I made a
ton of friends and I was really really
shy and so and that's something I still
struggle with and I know most people
don't believe me when I say that but I
do still struggle with being shy and I
think I might make a video about that um
but anyway so yeah I started my makeup
for plays and then I've just
progressively gotten better and then at
Roosevelt for musical theater we had a
makeup course and I learned a lot about
the light and the shadow and where to
place things to bring certain features
forward and sink certain things back and
we used a lot of Ben Nye stage makeup
products which I no longer have any of
and I know if the brushes either I'm
kind of sad because browsers were pretty
cool um but yeah so a lot of cream
products that were used for that but I
noticed a lot of it broke out my skin so
I eventually tossed all of it I think
which is I'm kind of sad about now but
um but yeah so that's where I learned a
lot about makeup and since then you know
I've just learned more let's see what
was I like in high school I think a lot
of people didn't like me in high school
and I think it was because I'm very it's
something I realize I'm very thoughtful
and I'm I mean
that didn't sound right I think a lot
I'm in my head a lot so when I'm walking
down the hallway I have a very almost
stoic face because I'm just lost in
thought and I think people used to think
I was just really mean because I've
always kind of had a scowl on my face
because I was just thinking you know and
so I don't know it's very interesting
but I was the president of the drama
club and of the show choir and I was I
love show choir back when I was so much
fun and actually you can find videos on
YouTube of me singing a solo from one of
the songs I can link it down below I
guess it just sounds silly because it
was like six or seven years ago but I
guess I could link it down below of me
singing the solo for the song and it was
just so much fun I think that was my
senior year and that is just filled with
so much love for me and I know for all
of my close friends during that it's
just so much fun anyway so I was present
those things and I just like to keep
myself busy and I was in musicals and
stuff both outside of school and in
school so it was a lot of fun um my
favorite purse
sorry total change of subject would be
my Michael Kors bag here my boyfriend
got it for me this past Christmas
I just love has an outside pocket and
these chain detail but it's a nice size
and the straps are long enough that I
can wear it on my shoulder without any
problems you know what I mean and then
there's just a lot of organization
inside if you can see there's like a
zipper pocket and other things so I
really like it the lining is easy to
clean and it's just really well made um
I love it and I'm pretty sure I'm going
to switch back to it um just cuz the
person I'm using now I don't know I do
carry a lot of things my person it's a
little tight squeeze now so I might
switch it anyway favorite lotion would
have to be this sleep it's the
aromatherapy from Bath and Body Works
the sleep body lotion and it's in the
scent warm milk and honey and it just
smells amazing and now I kind of
associate the smell with sleep because I
always put it on before I go to bed I'll
put it on like my neck and decollete and
my hands and it just it smells so nice
and calming and of course it's got some
cheesy thing on the front talking about
how you know these will you know lull
you to sleep and I'm sure it's probably
just a placebo effect but effect but I
swear I fall asleep pretty quickly when
I use it so I like it um what do you do
when you're not making videos well I do
a lot of things I babysit a lot by nan e
a lot I am
constantly doing homework or doing
school right what else I read a lot I
hang out with friends and my boyfriend
of course I'm trying to think I I mean I
just have lots of little odd jobs I have
a job with radio station I it's kind of
hard to explain
I do a lot of different things and I
think it's because not only am i
learning how to teach but I also have
this background of music and theater and
stuff so that I can just do a lot of
different things so it's it's really fun
but it's also really busy how many
siblings do I have ooh I have a lot I
have five siblings three of them are
sisters and I have one older brother and
then one lower whore younger brother
he's lower but I mean he's like 22 so um
but I love them all I'm close with most
of my siblings not all of them and we
just have so much fun a family
gatherings I'm an aunt to like 12 people
like we just have a big happy family
it's a lot of fun and family
get-togethers then we're all really loud
and steady okay my boyfriend's name is
Tyler and I've mentioned that we met
doing a show together we were doing
Aladdin and he was playing a Latin and I
was playing jasmine so we both love
Disney too so it just all kind of melts
together and he's just my best friend
and we we just have so much fun together
it's been three years now we've been
over three years and my heart still
skips a beat when I see he's calling me
if he's in that crazy but I don't know
we just we're each other's best friend
and we talk about everything and we just
make each other laugh and we listen and
we both are total nerds like we both
love to read and we both love to learn
where it's total nerds and we both love
to go to garage sales on Saturday
mornings like we there's so many little
things we just enjoy each other's
company as well just sitting there
quietly and reading next to each other I
love doing it like it's just I just like
him um why did I name my channel jkm
Beauty 89 that would be my initials J am
Jessica Ann Murphy Beauty just because I
figured I would focus on beauty products
and things like that
um and then 89 is the year I was born
1789 okay tattoos or piercings no I have
these pierced that's about it I once had
this
you're pierced but it it like uh got
infected right off the bat so I'd take
it out and I was really really sad but
that's all I don't have any tattoos or
piercings other than that so I guess I'm
kind of Plain Jane but I've never had
the desire to get any more so who knows
I might change but um let's see
favorite book okay The Perks of Being a
Wallflower I know they just made a movie
of this and I haven't seen the movie
actually but I read this book like I
wonder when this was published I read
this book exposed in 1999 I would say in
probably a 2004 back in high school
someone got it for me and I loved it and
if you're in high school and you're
watching this video pick this book up
and read it it's amazing and I don't
know it's one of those books that you go
through and highlight because you just
love the way certain passages are worded
or they're really gonna help you through
a certain part of your life you know
what I mean it's a very I don't know how
to describe this book it's very
transcendental if you know what that
word means that's one of those words
that I know when to use it but it's hard
to explain to someone but this book is
very much that another book that I love
is Eat Pray Love and I actually don't
have a copy because usually I'll buy
like five or six copies from half-price
books for like a dollar two and then
I'll just give them out to all my
friends with like a note on the inside
cover because hey I love giving books
away to people with notes in them
because I think it's just so like
old-fashioned and just I just love that
but I just like the idea of passing on
things you love like books and I hope
that the friends I've given them to
they'll write their name in it and then
pass it on to another friend and it's
just such a cool thing
but Eat Pray Love it's by Elizabeth
Gilbert and of course there's a movie
made of it as well and the movie was
okay but the thing about movies is it's
so hard to get into the true grit of the
characters in like the heart of the
story there's so much detail missing and
the thing is there's so much power in
the way author's word things that it's
really hard to capture that in a movie
and eat Pray Love is very much like that
it's not like it's a bad film I still
liked it but the book it's just another
one that I highlighted all throughout
the copies I used to have and it's just
it would be helpful for any part of your
life
anyone that's an
stage of life would enjoy this book for
totally different reasons it touches on
love and life and religion and
spirituality and it's I just feel like
it applies to any religion any way of
being in the world I think it would
touch upon so I love that book and would
recommend it to everyone that I meet my
favorite TV show would have to be the
office and it's about to end sooner I'm
gonna be really sad I love it and I also
love Modern Family the middle all the
old school shows like Fresh Prince of
bel-air and Saved by the Bell and Boy
Meets World all those just have a warm
place in my heart
and when they're on I'm like yes also
Rugrats do you remember that show loved
that show and I recorded all the time
cuz it's on like one of the Nickelodeon
channels like it like 2:00 in the
morning
so I'll set them to record so I can
watch them all the time like just when
I'm cleaning or whatever I just love
them I had a great childhood and I like
to reminisce anyway um yes Oh another
one favorite Disney character would have
to probably be I got you Donald Duck is
my favorite classic now I love Mickey
and Minnie and like I have a little
thing of them on my vanity but Donald
Duck is my jam he's so funny and he's so
sassy and like you can always hear him
like just throwing a fit like I love
Donald Duck so much in his little
feathery tails so cute and then also I
love Rapunzel from tangled I love the
songs and that I love me any more who
did the voice and I think the movie was
so well done and I just love everything
about it so definitely that's so yeah I
will definitely make another video like
this and if you enjoyed this please
