my get to know me video for you guys and
I asked you guys a few weeks ago for a
bunch of questions and I've got a ton
I'm gonna have to break this up into two
parts because it's going to be really
really long otherwise and there I have
even more questions that I won't get to
answer that I'll eventually get you to
because there were a ton which is
awesome so grab yourself a cup of coffee
and let's go ahead and get to know me
alright so the first thing a lot of
people asked about my siblings and my
family and I do have a very large family
and it is wonderful and so basically my
parents are still together and they we
have I'm sorry I'm having I literally
have to think I have five siblings I
have two brothers and three sisters I
have my oldest brother and then three
sisters then me and then my youngest
brother and my youngest brother is 20
I think he's 24 now no 23 and he's in
the Navy and he's off protecting all of
us so I'm very thankful for him and yeah
so I'm very blessed that all of my
siblings are I'm close with all of them
and two of them like I said my brother
doesn't live here in town and neither
does one of my sisters she lives over on
the east coast here I've got 12 nieces
and nephews and I think I became an aunt
when I was like three or four
my oldest brother who's much older than
I am like by I want to say sixteen or
seventeen years he was already having
kids he was already married having kids
when I was like a little kid a little
baby so um yeah so I've always had kids
around me and they've it's just I don't
know and I think that might be part of
the reason why I want to teach cuz I
like finger I guess I just like kids I'm
used to it um so another question how
old I am
I'm 25 I'm 25 it's funny because I it
rained
this there's such a spectrum when people
find out that I'm 25 some people like
yeah that makes sense and none of the
people like I thought you were 16 I'm
like okay um you know take it sounds
like um well take that and then other
people like oh I thought you were like
40 I'm like so I was just so funny I'm
like well I
my register is different ages to
everyone which maybe that's a good thing
but I am 25 and my birthday's in January
a winter baby actually I was born on a
Superbowl Sunday not funny um another
person asked what I was like when I was
a kid I was very very shy as a kid and I
still I mean I remember in elementary
school like I would never raise my hand
in class III I got good grades you know
but I just was terrified I just was shy
and I still have some of that anxiety
and I'm sure that won't come across I'm
here because I'm just talking to a
camera but I really do
still face a lot of anxiety when it
comes to social gatherings and I think
that's a reason why I'm such a homebody
I would much rather be at home you know
where I'm comfortable and where I know
everyone that's around me and um and
I've always I've thought about doing a
video about kind of overcoming that
shyness because I do think I have some
kind of tips and tricks of how I've kind
of taught myself to be a little bit more
of an extrovert and most people that
meet me would never guess that I'm very
very shy because I don't show it and I
think it's just taken me time to learn
how to do that so if you kind of suffer
from the same thing I do and you want
some help let me know because I'd love
to make a video on that of how I've kind
of overcome my shyness but um yeah that
has been a battle for me in my life um
another person asked what I was like in
high school um I went to a very large
high school like my graduating class was
like almost a thousand people or maybe a
little less than that um then I went to
public schools my whole life I'm a
public school teacher that's just that's
my world and I I like that um anyway but
I was I was kinda I think I was not
liked by a lot of people and it makes me
sad and there you know everyone goes
through stuff in high school and in
middle school we all I mean there are
just moments that were terrible there
was a moment where I had gossiped about
someone and that person like threw paint
on me in the hallway and so I had paint
all over me the rest of the I mean
things happen and it was rough but then
there were other times that were
wonderful so but I
president of the drama club my senior
year president of the show choir my
senior year actually I have video and in
my first get ready with me or my get to
know me video I put a link to one of our
performances from when I was in show
choir in high school where I had a solo
so all if I remember I'll link that
below too because that was that was one
of those moments in high school that I
loved
show choir I loved I look back and I'm
like oh it's so like I don't want to say
cheesy because in the moment it is so
much fun and I wouldn't have changed
anything um but it's just so funny you
look back to like oh my gosh like we
were so into it and as an adult I look
and I'm like oh so kind of silly but I
loved it so if you're someone that does
show choir or did show choir or is
thinking about doing doing show choir do
it you will love it it is so much fun um
anyway so in high school and I got good
grades I was in the top 10 my class
which I'm very proud of because I worked
very hard for that um but yeah I was I
don't know it's almost hard to describe
yourself they were trying time there
good times and that's high school and if
you're in high school right now you know
that I mean you're facing it every day
in college is no different I mean
there's differences but there's just as
much drama um so let's see my college
journey people were asking about so I'm
25 and I just graduated with a
bachelor's degree and a lot of people
were asking well did you get your
masters like you're 25 why are you just
graduating I went to school I live in
Indiana I went to school in Chicago for
two and a half years for musical theater
which meant I was singing I was studying
singing dancing and acting basically so
I would have voice lessons and we would
have dance classes and acting classes
and we were in shows and we were working
on crew for shows you had to do and um
getting to see a ton of shows up there
and I mean I did that because I loved
theater that's what I do it
professionally here still from time to
time I certainly did it a lot I'm
especially community theater before
going up to Chicago and I loved it and I
was told I was pretty good at it and I
enjoyed doing it so I was like well this
makes sense and I don't think at the
time I really thought about a
how much debt I would have from student
loans on top cuz you know at the time ya
go we'll just pull out loans would be
fine I'll pay him back in the future you
don't think about it and now I have so
many student loans it's like and I know
I'm the only one I bet there's a lot of
you watching this that are like mm-hmm
and now the reality sets in like and now
I've graduated and now I have I mean
thousands and thousands and thousands of
dollars in student debt that I'm gonna
have to pay back and at the time I just
didn't think about it and so um I it I
enjoyed it but at the same time I hated
it and I don't really know how to
describe it and at the time I had
wonderful experiences I was able to go
to New York and I had like callbacks for
Broadway shows while I was still in
school and that was amazing I mean I
wouldn't trade those experiences for
anything but at the same time I was just
so disillusioned with everyone that was
around me and I had friends there it's
not that there weren't wonderful people
that went there and I loved my
professors but I just realized that
there was so much unnecessary
competition and cattiness and I felt
like I wasn't growing I was like making
mistakes and I just wasn't myself up
there and on top of that I knew I always
wanted to teach so after a lot of
deliberation I moved back home and I
started going to school here for
teaching and I met wonderful people had
again wonderful professors and I finally
feel like I found my niche like that
this is where I'm supposed to be and
I've never felt happier and I feel like
myself I feel I don't know and I loved
living in Chicago I love the city and I
visited one of my best best best friends
lives up there and I see her a couple
times a year but um other than that I
don't miss just the drama of musical
theatre and theatre and audition so I'm
like and you're never certain of
anything for me some people I think they
have personalities they can totally
handle that and it's perfect for their
lifestyle I can't do it I don't I don't
enjoy that I like security and it's not
that I don't still do theater I do but
just on my own terms and that's what I
like about it it's on my own terms so
alright we chatted about that for way
too long
sorry guys what got me into beauty okay
well I've always liked makeup
only were in when I was doing theater
you know you do makeup ever since I was
um probably like sixth grade because I
we had to you know do our own makeup for
like the sixth grade play and that's
kind of when I got into theater and that
was always fun and I always wore like
just blue eye shadow like I had no idea
what I was doing it was so funny and
looking at pictures I'm like oh yes I
still feel like I don't know what I'm
doing but um and then we learned a
little bit more of like some techniques
when people were brought in the teaches
about makeup in show choir so that we
could all have like a kind of a uniform
makeup look although I'm sure it never
looked uniform but I thought that was
really cool um and so then I moved up
Chicago obviously and then we took stage
makeup classes there so I learned a lot
about just shadow and light that I had
no idea had anything to do with it you
know I was just learning about oh you
you should just put your shadow here you
should just put this here never knew why
so that's where I learned a lot about
the art of makeup but I'm not a makeup
artist I think you guys know that I've
never going to be definitely not one I
just enjoy it I guess you'd call me a
beauty enthusiast I just enjoy it I've
played with a lot of makeup so I just
kind of have a lot of knowledge about
what's out there and I like to think I
at least know something about how to do
makeup but if you were asking me to do
someone else's makeup I don't think I'd
do very good to being honest because
doing your own makeup versus doing
someone else's is a totally different
beast and I think that is where you want
someone trained in that or at least
someone that's really good at I really
haven't even practiced it really anyway
sweat oh I'm sweating
you guys like my Minnie Mouse shirt it's
not actually a Minnie Mouse shirt but I
got it at like goodwill for a couple
dollars and of course I thought of
Minnie Mouse and like I am obviously
buying that there okay let's see has
teaching always been my number one
profession choice yes and no because
like I said I've always wanted to be a
teacher but I also loved theater and
everyone kind of said yeah you should
totally do that so I did and then I was
like I think I hate this I like doing
the theater part but all that comes with
it I hate it um but one thing that both
Tyler my boyfriend and I both believe
that a career is not a life sentence and
I think that's something about our
generation that maybe is new because I
think like back I think of my parents
and how you know
you started a career and that was kind
of it and you just did that for the rest
of your life whether you liked it or not
and maybe something would happen you
switch but you know most people would
just stick with the same thing but it's
not a career is just not a life sentence
you don't have to just because I want to
teach right now if in ten years I'm not
liking it anymore and I'm finding myself
maybe not being a good teacher because I
burn out then I'm going to find
something else there's no reason to stay
unhappy and especially if you have the
luxury of maybe youth the person you're
with has a good job so it's fine or you
know you know you've got family as a
backbone to help you get a new job I
don't know you know you have to be smart
about the decision but at the same time
know that you're not trapped no one's
forcing you to stay in that job so
that's why I feel blessed I have a lot
of hobbies that I enjoy doing I love my
youtube channel um I love teaching right
now I love knitting I love reading I
mean I have a lot of different hobbies I
feel like I could go do something else
if I really wasn't enjoying them I guess
what I'm saying is I'm just not what a
person that would just stay in one place
just to be comfortable even though I'd
rather become I'm just going around with
circles okay
speaking of Tyler so a lot of people
asked how we met and more about him I am
begging him to do a video he's like well
I don't want to like he I think he's
willing to do it but he just feels like
it'll be awkward I'm like Tyler it's
literally a camera me and you that's it
and like Tyler the ladies will love you
would you guys will love him Bonita he's
so funny
but um eventually I'll get him to do it
I want to do the boyfriend tag I want to
do the boyfriend does my makeup will be
hilarious although he might be good I
guess he was in theatre too so he
actually might be okay I guess we'll see
anyway um
but how we met was doing theater we
actually were both doing the show
Aladdin and it was like the kids version
of it like for kids we weren't kids
obviously and he was playing Aladdin I
was playing jasmine and I had this this
big old black Jasmine wig and my brows
were black and I mean well it did not
look like me um and that's how we met
and at the time I was kind of at the end
of a terribly rocky relationship with
someone else that actually I was
age two so that ended and boy I'm
thankful for that but um I kind of met
him at that time and you know I knew in
my head I'm like maybe I shouldn't you
know because I'm like I'm obviously
vulnerable right now
and if anyone that's gotten out of a
really long relationship obviously
you're vulnerable for quite a while but
there was just something about him and I
mean there's so many things but I just
remember seeing him come into the room
and I was like who is that
and he's like it wasn't like he was like
dressed like all dapper he had like a
baseball cap on and sweatpants that
shirt it was like a dance rehearsal
whatever but I just like who is that and
I just felt something I don't know and
and then I just remember I kept catching
myself like staring at him from across
the room like stop it Jessica like get a
hold of yourself you're a grown woman
and so we would just talk and we learned
that we happen to be the same religion
and then we you know and just the
morning where we talked we started
hanging out and I just love him and I
know he loves me I'm like getting
teary-eyed
but anyway so it's kind of poetic and I
remember that um sorry I remember the
the dance the choreographer who is a
friend of both of ours now he was he
even tells us now that he kind of knew
he just knew which he very well might
have um but he was choreographing just
our kiss at the very end of the show and
of course I'm all butterflying like oh
my gosh again schism it was just like a
Disney kiss just press your lips
together and that's it but um he was um
you know choreographing it and he was
all blushy and my court and so we did it
and it was just one of those things that
like even just our lips felt right
together and I know well that might
sound weird but I don't know and um
image it all was history now we just
started going on dates and that's kind
of medium but I think that's another
reason why Disney is such a big part of
my life too because cannot stop crying
if you don't know this about me I'm a
very emotional person I'm just like my
mother I love it um anyway but so that's
why Disney is a big deal it's a big part
of our lives and we go to Disney World
all the time
and actually hold on one of my favorite
things I've ever gotten from a
subscriber she came and actually saw me
in a show here cuz she happens to live
here in Indiana not far from me and she
brought me a bunch of goodies but she
also brought me this and I it's actually
the first Minnie Mouse doll I've ever
owned and I adore it I adore it so much
um so just know that when you guys send
me things I love them I love them um
I've got my little wombat that my friend
from Australia sent me um I mean I just
I keep everything you guys send me and
especially when I was something to do
with something I'm interested in like
Disney or you know um a Canadian
subscriber semi Canadian socks I wear
those suckers all the time um so I hope
you guys know that you are very
appreciated and just I feel blessed
because I watch a lot of people that
have a lot of negative comments and well
I get negative comments from time to
time I just feel that I'm very blessed
it's not as often as I thought it would
be and that was one thing that was
really nerve-wracking when I'm starting
my channel I was like I don't want I
can't face that much negativity all the
time but I you guys are wonderful and
even when you say something negative
it's kind of put in a positive light
which still is like nuts but I think you
guys mean well when you do that you know
it's not anything anyway I got to stop I
gotta stop cuz I'll just keep crying
alright let's see moving on so that's
how time that I met we love Disney World
that might be part of the reason why um
so that's all I answer for this video
I'm gonna film right after this kind of
the second part and I'll upload it a
little bit later um just because this is
going to be a very very long video if I
don't so so I hope you enjoyed this stay
tuned for my get to know me part 2 video
where I answer more of your guys's
questions and I'll catch you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
