me clearly I'm in the same outfit as my
original get to know me video because
I'm filming this all together but I
figured I would break it up just because
it is a very it was like 30 minutes I'm
like I should break this up that way you
know you can just you can get to know me
on little spurts not all the same time
no I'm kidding
so I have even more questions to answer
for you guys so here we go okay so first
question for this one what are my roots
I am Irish mostly who I mean my last
name is Murphy I am quite Irish and
actually my family my I think it was
just my great-grandparents or maybe it
was great great came over during the
great potato famine in the 1850s is that
right people from Ireland is that when
it was maybe 1860s well somewhere in
there or maybe 1830s oh my gosh I need
to look this up I used to know it like
anyway so they came over in the 1800s
during the great potato famine and just
kind of started over here and so and
that's mostly from my dad's side and
they kind of settled in Oh had the Ohio
kind of area as they moved inward and so
his side of family my dad sided families
most of them live in Ohio in Cleveland
actually and he's a big Cleveland
Indians fan and Browns fans poor Browns
and and then my mother's side of the
family is from Mississippi Meridian so
if anyone is from Meridian out there you
live nearby let me know down below
because my mom will love that
so her side and family we visit from
time to time they live in Meridian and
we have to have a visited them in a long
time but so my mom's got a little
southern accent I just love it and my
dad's a Yankee through and through he's
such a Yankee anyway not a Yankee like
the sports team just like a Yankee like
I don't know I got northerner anyway so
but I also from my mom's side I have
Cherokee in me Native American and I
think that's only my great-grandparents
my grandmother's name was like I think
her name is like Oregon Missouri isn't
that such a cool name
so I have a little bit of Native
American meat and a little bit of Irish
so I'm fair-skinned
but I tan well so there's that um lot
another person asked if I dye my hair or
if I ever well I've never dyed my hair
actually and that's why it's just kind
of a flat brown but I was actually born
with kind of reddish hair and when I'm
in the Sun you can you do see a lot not
a lot of red but it does have a little
bit of a reddish tint to it and I will
iron down my hair I mean I don't want to
say never I never say never because you
just never know but as of right now I
don't really have any plan sometimes I
think like oh I could go a little
lighter but I'm like I don't know I
don't mind my hair color I like being a
brunette I mean that's the way I was
made and there was a reason he chose
this to be my hair color maybe it is the
most flattering thing for me I don't
know but that's kind of my thing but who
knows well the who knows favorite ice
cream oh my gosh like cherry ice cream
or like cherry with chocolate and
another person asked my favorite color
pink and that ice cream is usually pink
which I love but cherry shakes I love
cherry ice cream I just love it if
you've never had it get it it is so good
um okay now I'm just jumping all around
okay what is my pet peeves this video is
so long I'm trying to see pet peeves one
of my biggest one my biggest one is when
people are like have fake personalities
and that kind of sprung from what I was
in theater and just a lot of people
around me were just very fake and I was
like be real I don't understand how you
can go through life and like I feel like
they're performing all the time like
they're monologuing all the time and
making people laugh and I get that I
mean I can be silly and I can do that
from time to time but I don't understand
that I I don't get that I really don't
and then when I started watching YouTube
videos I and I could do a whole video on
this but I would really like some people
and then I would start to realize after
a few videos I'm like I think this
personality is kind of fake like they'll
do that fake quirky thing like where
they're like intentionally quirky but in
real life they probably aren't or I
don't know and that's not true about all
of them there are plenty of people but
in reality I just start
to them I have a very small pool of
people that I actually watch on here
that I don't feel is being fake because
I can't do it I see right through it I'm
sure you guys do too and I can not do it
I just I'm like nine I'll time for all
this I do not have time for your fake
breasts now just be yourself you might
be semi quirky then just be sort of
quirky you don't need to be over-the-top
quirky just because some people that
have tons of subscribers are you know I
don't know I don't even have a specific
person in mind anymore but just I feel
like there's a lot of that on here and
I'm like just be reasonable um ooh
someone asks what my favorite show
well a few people asked what my favorite
show or rolled that I've ever done in
this show I've done a few and they were
all kind of in the past like some of all
of these were from high school because I
got to play roles in high school that I
probably wouldn't play like elsewhere
maybe when I'm older or maybe this one I
probably would one of them I loved doing
was Wendy and Peter Pan Peter Pan Disney
duh but it's just I just loved it I just
loved it so that was a problem we got to
fly which was really cool to do another
favorite was when I got to play the
witch and into the woods which that that
musical is amazing and sometimes of
course arts amazing music but they're
doing a movie version of it soon and
Meryl Streep is playing the Witch and I
can't wait but that was so much fun to
play because that's a role I would
probably never be cast as just cuz it if
you know the show you'd know why it
doesn't make sense for me but but one
that I might be cast as elsewhere would
be I got to play on Narus in I eat up
and if you know that show that was fun
cuz was all kinds of belty and it was so
much fun and it was ancient Egypt which
I have a nerdy obsession with and I have
for a very long time and so that was
really really really cool um how can I
afford high-end things on a drugstore
budget now you guys know and this goes
along with another question well first
of all I don't really buy high-end
makeup unless it's like through whole
look or like I'm getting cash back
through Ebates
and I know I can some people have asked
me to do a whole video on he bakes maybe
I will or maybe a whole video on this
but in short terms
whole look they have all kinds of things
for crazy cheap like the bomb is always
on there too
Tarantino's on there two-face was just
on there I bought a ton of lipstick and
they're usually $22 and they were like
$8 on there I was like huh I could get
like three for the price of one so you
better believe I did but you just kind
of kind of got to watch it like a hawk
create an account and just wait but and
then he makes you get cash back so if
you go there to the site first create an
account create and go to the site first
and then go to where you're gonna shop
through that site you get cash back and
it's awesome but I could do a whole
video on that stuff and a lot of a lot
of person what a lot of people have
asked why do I get rid of so much makeup
and also why do I sell it instead of
give it away I don't sell everything
most things I do give away I have a bag
filled with makeup I'm getting rid of
that I'm just giving to my sisters some
things I say just because they might
still be brand-new but I just know
they'll love it more than I will other
things I sell because I know that my
sisters and friends just won't wear it
you know if it's a crazy colors or if
it's you know my sisters they don't have
a collection like I do they don't want a
collection like I do so you know if I
given them three different eyeshadow
palettes in a year they're like okay you
know that's good how many can they
possibly own that they're gonna use so
and then on top of that it's just a
crazy lip color I'm not gonna get
they're just not going to use it would
just go to waste just as it is in my
collection so I kind of used my best
judgment when it comes to what I'm going
to sell and what I'm going to keep in
giveaway I'm that same goes for jewelry
and clothes and purses and whatever some
people have said I can't believe you're
so greedy that you just you're selling
the jewelry stuff giving it away I'm
like usually I've asked my sisters and
they you know I'll show them the jury
and they'll say no I don't really want
it or they've already gone through it
and then I sell was left on top of that
I I think people think then on YouTube
you make a ton of money I do not make
that much money I mean it's a nice chunk
that it helps with bills mostly my car
payment but it's not like an exorbitant
amount like at least it's not right now
here at thirty thousand subscribers I
think people have this grandiose idea
that we make some money and boy I'm not
making that much money right now but
like I said it's enough that it helps
but
like I said I have so much student loan
debt and just bills it's not any
different than anyone else's life so
that is you know when I sell those
things either I put them back into my
channel and I buy like this camera that
I got or I buy a new tripod or right now
I want to really get a light so I can do
better tutorials so I can do because
I've only done like one or two tutorials
because the lighting is just not good
for that it watches and you can see I
mean if you saw me in person right now
this look is really a lot but on the
camera with natural lighting it's kind
of flushed out which is fine and it's
not like it looks bad but I have to take
everything on and then it still gets
washed out anyway so it's hard to
explain basically I will take that money
and put it into my channel in some way
or I'll buy some new products that
everyone's asking me to review or you
know or I use it to pay bills because I
need you know and this is kind of one of
my jobs so I hope you guys understand
that that's why I do it it's not because
I'm greedy it's probably because I
actually need the money anyway so yes
the last one I'll answer today because
there's a ton tips on starting a channel
and this if you'd like to me to do a
whole video on this I would love to
because I've got a lot of tips of things
that have worked for me and things that
didn't work for me can I'd say don't
even worry about this but do do this you
know but my main short-term tips are
just be yourself like for real be
yourself don't try and be what everyone
else is because there's no point there
someone all these types of videos we
watch this a thing like you know someone
first had the idea to do a product
empties video and now everyone does it
someone first had the idea to do get
ready with me videos and now everyone
does it you can create your own staple
videos you don't have to just do that
like my everyday makeup drawer that is
something I just thought up and you know
I would see people would kind of do like
everyday you know what's in my makeup
bag type of things but that at least
from what I know that was my idea and
I'm so excited and I would love if that
was something that caught on because I
love making them and I love
watching that type of video so you don't
have to follow suit there's nothing
wrong with doing your own type of
tutorial it doesn't have to be exactly
the same way that everyone else does it
that's not to say you shouldn't steal
cuz you should totally steal from other
people because andrew has great ideas
and it's public domain it's not like
you're stealing if you're taking the
idea of using the bokeh effect on a
photo you know everyone does it because
it's really cute and if you like that
then do it there's nothing wrong but
there's no shame in that
but also not being ashamed to do your
own thing I think people get used to a
certain type of video here on YouTube
and when you don't do that people like
why don't you do a voiceover instead of
this or why don't you do and I'm like
because they're their own person and
they do it how they want to do it if you
don't like it no one's forcing you to
watch that you know that right um but so
be real work really hard in my main tip
is just learn if you can every week
learn one thing to improve your channel
your channels can be awesome by the end
of the year you know like the other day
I was like I want to make my thumbnails
better so I figured out that a lot of
people use this PicMonkey website and so
I got on there and taught it to myself
and now if you've wanted looked my last
like probably 5 or 6 thumbnails are
bobbler because I worked really hard on
learning that stupid little free website
that I love but just taking time to
learn one more thing like everyone smile
I'll pick up my camera booklet and learn
how to do one more thing with it because
there's so much to learn or I'll look up
a youtube video on it if you've noticed
I haven't had as many issues with
autofocusing like doing it randomly
because I'm like I realized I just need
to do manual focus and make sure it's um
centered on me and you know I took the
time to learn that one week and that's
gotten better little by little your
channel will get better I promise and
just so you know I first started this is
a thirty minute video holy crap
just so you know I first started my
youtube channel with my iPhone 4s which
actually I still have the same iPhone 4s
I need to update my phone but it works
I'm not worried about I don't really
care that much to be honest but um but
that's what I did for the first probably
eight or nine months
no probably like year no probably eight
or nine months I just bought like a $5
little tripod on eBay that would fit my
phone and I had
on a little TV tray table in front of my
window and that is what I did and it
worked just fine obviously it's not as
good of quality as like my Canon t5i is
but it's pretty good for you know a
beginning chin are you kidding and if my
never broke I guess what I'd be using my
phone for a while because it's really
not that bad and it's way better than
like a web cam would be because I had
initially started with that and I was
like this isn't working
so if I can get I'll get to it I'll have
to link my very first video below I
haven't changed a bit
I was watching I'm like I am so thankful
that I was still the same girl like
you're gonna laugh when you watch exceed
like yep that is Jessica I've changed
and I don't plan on us so don't you
worry
anyway so I hope this part 2 was
enjoyable for you guys and so glad you
watch I'm glad you got to know a little
bit more about me and I will catch you
guys very soon but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
