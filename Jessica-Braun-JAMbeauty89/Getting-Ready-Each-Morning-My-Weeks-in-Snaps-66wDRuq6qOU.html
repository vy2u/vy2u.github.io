under the skin break out I've been
treating it with like some salicylic
acid I might need to switch to what's
the other one benzoyl something
something because I do wonder a
salicylic acid doesn't work on my skin I
don't know it's been there for like
three days
it hasn't really gotten any better
although I've got one I'm just I got a
ton of hormonal breakouts I'm losing my
freakin mind anyway but that's not what
I came on here to talk about I've been
using this nourish organic eye treatment
it has avocado and argan oil and I use
it obviously on my under eye and all
around in the mornings and I just feel
like it's got one of those metal tips
that just feels cooling but I just feel
like it's really nice it does feel super
moisturizing I just kind of wakes my
eyes up in the morning also don't make
fun of me I painted my nails for like
the first time in I don't even remember
the last time I painted my nails I'm
gonna be very honest I paint my toenails
every time but I don't remember the last
time I painted them it's been months and
months and months and so I did but I
chose one of these colors that I was
like oh it's so fall except for this is
one of those colors that if you screw up
around the edges it like stains for days
so I'm like I just feel like my fingers
look like bloody that's why I never wear
colors like this see that's why shade
that I put on by the way is butter
LONDON in the shade Ruby Marie I don't
really like the butter LONDON formula
I don't these are expensive I don't know
why because I don't think they're very
good I've gotten rid of like every other
butter LONDON polish I've had cuz over
the years I've realized I really don't
like it so when I break out I always use
my coverfx calming primary cuz I feel
like it does a good job of not inflaming
my skin of just kind of calming down any
redness I have it's moisturizing it
feels nice and soothing on the skin so
this is one of my favorites when I've
got kind of breakouts going on on my
skin
holy crap okay I was just trying out the
it cosmetics bye bye break out then I've
used it on places on my skin so I've got
it on there you can still see the
texture but I put it on the tip of my
nose I don't have foundation anywhere
yet but I put this on the tip of my nose
and just quickly went buck up with my
sponge I feel like that redness that was
it was like shiny and red because there
were a couple breakouts gone that is
wild
holy moly so this stuff is cool because
let me see let me turn the camera around
I can't do it that way so it's bye-bye
breakout it says it's full coverage
treatment concealer it has this little
doe foot but it goes into the jar this
is in the shade light and I like then
it's actually a little darker so it's
not going to look bright on your skin on
the breakout it's gonna actually maybe
match your skin this is just I mean this
is so cool it actually works
hoodoo every time I try to walk away
from this product it appears in my
drawer again and my cool go want to use
that again it's the freaking elf
flawless finish foundation okay that's
as good as that it's gonna get unless I
want to make it really cakey not gonna
do it I would rather have a little
blemish show through than a gross dry
cakey mess that's my own preference but
this foundation makes my skin look so
youthful and glowy but not like oily in
my opinion I love it so much
this stuff is six freakin dollars it has
a pump it's in a nice glass jar this is
I just love his presentation so much if
you've been listening to me for years
and you have a similar skin type and you
haven't tried it you've got to try it
you might like for me I'm mixing
porcelain which is the lightest with
sand and it's like the perfect color for
me I can get away with wearing either
one but like if I wear porcelain I need
to bronze new as I was saying porcelain
is a little light but I could bronze it
up if I want it and then sand is a
little dark but it could work you know
but so if you can find your I know
they've recently added some more shades
and actually I should look at the shade
list because they might now have one
they might already have one
I don't really know how I ended up with
these colors I don't know if I like
bought them or if I bought them online I
never know but I love this foundation so
freaking much
so I used my ELF mat format to palette I
forgot how good this is it really is
good way more pigmented in my opinion
than the mat format one and this is
around $10 and it's all matte I just
love it I'll show you the shades I'm
wearing here in just a second but I also
tried out a mascara this is from number
7 which I liked a lot of number 7
products this is their lash impact ultra
mascara this is after two coats it looks
I like it and I would bet if you're
looking at you're like oh that looks
nice like your lashes but my lashes are
kind of naturally curled I don't feel
like if you don't naturally have curly
lashes I felt like it was a very like
wet formula it just went and so I'm used
to mascaras that build upon itself
really well that was weird grammar but
you know what I mean and this one didn't
not that it's bad but it's definitely a
different formula than what I typically
go for so I need to keep trying it out
though I'm gonna try it for a few weeks
and kind of so I put this all over my
lid and then I use this all in the
crease that's what you're seeing on most
of my eye as well this I used on the
brow bone and kind of to start my look
just because it mad at everything else
and then I have this brown on my lower
lash line that's it so really it's just
this and this shade that I've used to
create the look I love this palette it's
so much more pigmented than I remember
well good morning I'm used to doing this
on snapchat but this is where I like on
snap I would usually get ready in the
mornings but I figure a lot more of you
guys are over here so I wanted to try it
and see if you guys liked it here on
Instagram so this morning I just put on
my coat Ali I love it because it sinks
in really really quickly which is huge
so I've got that on my skin right now I
also recently opened my mail I've got
some pixie lippies that I want to try
and then also Jay cat sent over some of
their little powders just like the Ben
Nye ones I think I might try porcelain
like to set my under eye today I think
that'd be a good match for my skin so
I'm gonna try the dream liquid mousse
from Maybelline today I've tried it a
couple times I to be honest I really
haven't developed a feel for it yet so
I'm excited I think this might be a bit
too dark but I'm gonna try to make it
work today so I feel like it certainly
doesn't have insanely high coverage I
need to put like separate concealer on
my blemish there but I feel like it does
make my skin look nice it doesn't say it
says airbrush finish so I would say so I
would say Mac's medium coverage for this
you can still see some like freckles and
things which I don't mind it's got a
finish that I like it's like not quite
dewy kind of more satin like I don't
know I like it we'll see how it wears
throughout this so what I always put on
breakouts is the it cosmetics bye bye
breakouts I've been really into this
this week I like it I've already put it
on so some of you guys are gonna be like
what you can still see it I'm not one of
those that likes to cover it so much
that it's cakey cuz I feel like that
draws more attention so I don't like
that it draws attention to the texture
of it things like that but this I feel
like it covers it enough where it's not
super red but it still feels comfortable
and breathable and I don't feel like I'm
doing something even worse to that area
you know what I mean this concealer I'm
using is a freaking mess because I've
been using it so much it's the new
Revlon youth effects I know the light
kind of anyway it's their fill and blur
concealer it's super comfortable to wear
very brightening so there it is blended
in I feel like it's brightening yes it
sinks into fine lines like I say all the
time no matter what I use concealer eyes
it always sinks into little fine lines
their fine lines and I don't like taking
a ton of powder
but I am gonna try that new powder I
showed you okay so I removed the sticker
and it dumped a ton out when I kind of
tapped it into the lid so that kind of
stinks but I'm excited to put this on my
under eye and see if it really is
brightening okay so I have it on this
under eye and not this one
instantly I can already see that it's
drawing attention well I guess you can
see it on both it's definately mattified
the area do I think it overly brightened
it mmm I'm not so sure I'm gonna I did
it with a little blue I did it with a
little brush so I think I'm gonna try it
with a sponge on the other side to see
if it makes a difference in the cover
okay so I do think there was a little
more coverage with the sponge it puts
more on but do you see how and this is
true for me no matter what powder I use
no matter how I use it I feel like it
really draws attention to those fine
lines and makes them creepy but it was
brightening I mean I do feel like
overall it it's a nice look but it's um
I don't know
also now I just chipped my nail polish
this is why I don't paint my nails this
is what I get so overall if you're in
the market for one of these I don't know
the price point if this is like way
cheaper
I know Ben Nye you can get pretty good
deals on but I like it if you're close
to my skin tone porcelains a great match
if you're a little bit darker me I think
darker deeper skin tones maybe banana
would work they also had this Luminizer
I'll have to try another time
not meant for your under-eye I am sure
but just maybe for other areas of your
face but I've tried a banana type powder
like this and it's just way too dark for
me also a lot of you guys when you watch
my recent video about how to glam up
like in 10 minutes after work I shared a
makeup no no I do and you'll have to
watch the video to see what the nono is
however
you
a lot of you guys shared the Ulta sells
a wet slash dry pressed powder and I
thought oh my gosh that's perfect so I
ran out and picked it up yesterday after
work
i I after worked what am I saying I got
it in fair cuz light seemed a little bit
too dark for me okay aside from my hair
not being done huh-uh here's the final
look
so I actually tried out a bunch of
products for a video that you'll see in
the next few weeks but I'm trying some
products out but there's secret but what
I will tell you is they are affordable
it will be a full face of this brand and
yeah I'm really excited I've never
really done anything about this specific
brand but like I said it is affordable
and I'm wearing a lot of it on my face
and eyes today and I was pretty pretty
impressed not with everything but with a
lot of it good morning umm what is today
Thursday it feels like also I got eye
cream in my eye over here and I'm like
uh-huh now it's all irritated so I just
realized today I bet I use this anyway I
just realized today that this covergirl
vital is healthy elixir oh my gosh you
guys look at these nails anyway this is
the only covergirl foundation I think
that I've ever actually liked I feel
like I talked about it all the time but
I feel like I have it on today it's not
high coverage I would say max of medium
and even there it's like mmm but I just
feel like it's comfortable my skin
doesn't usually break out it just reacts
well to it and so I don't know it isn't
the packaging really pretty I love it I
this is an honest reaction might have
just discovered my new favorite
concealer oh you want to know what it is
it is this uLTA Beauty full coverage
concealer it's very like gel like it has
a doe foot applicator but it's very gel
like and I even put it down my nose and
up here do you see how even there it
like brightened like I said every
concealer I've ever tried sinks in a
fine line so far so I feel like I can't
hold that against any concealer I just
got like fine lines they just won't quit
but everything else like it blended like
that with a beauty sponge I just really
I really like it
um so we were camping all weekend long
my voice is a little tired so and I'm
also running late so it's gonna be quick
this morning but I already put on
foundation today I'm wearing my goog
photo perfection foundation in nope
but for concealer today I'm trying again
the pixie what do they call a pad away
concealing base I've been trying this
for about a month now but I used it on
my under eye area but I also use it in
like ton of highlight region so down - I
feel like it did a great job
brightening this area is always weird to
me on my face I don't know why that is
it's always like kind of sometimes it's
dry sometimes it's a little bit red and
I feel like it cleared that up really
nicely it's not awesome at concealing
dark circles
okay I'm just about ready I wanted to
tell you what I've been doing on my eyes
lately I've been using my anastacio
Modern Renaissance palette and I've just
been using that yellow shade right they
are golden ochre I'm trying to point out
it with my pinky just in the so I've
been using golden ochre in the crease
and you can see how like light it is and
then temp tempera or tempera all over
everywhere else before I put on the
crease color and then I've been using a
highlighter my Laura Mercier matte
radiance baked highlighter on like on my
lid and on my brow bone I just think
it's like a really simple look I put
Primavera the gold shade on my lower
lash line just for fun today but I just
like the way it looks it's so simple you
can't really screw it up and it's just
oh good morning so this morning I just
wanted to show I've been using this
serum for quite some time before I get
ready and I love it and I'm running low
oh my gosh but it sinks into your skin
so freakin quickly so like I just put it
on like a minute ago and I feel like
it's already sunk in whereas other
serums especially like ones I typically
use at night I feel like those by minute
four is finally ready for me to put the
next layer on so this is like the best
it really is like the best serum for put
it for before putting on your makeup I
did a video with them a long time ago
about this and some other stuff I love
all this products but this one I still
had some left so I've been using and I
just so I just put on this Revlon
Photoready brightening primer it was
sitting in my drawer and I thought when
did I get like what and I hadn't tried
it I was like okay so it has a pump
which I very much appreciate but it's
kind of got that white tint to it and
then it blends to kind of like a Velvet
silicone type finish very reminiscent of
the famous hourglass primer like I am
telling you it is exactly like this I
need to prep for another dupes video
like dead on that is awesome oh my gosh
it feels really nice on my skin and it
didn't pill up or anything like that I
also wanted to try this Laura Geller
real deal concealer on this little
breakout here that's probably too much I
have another one like there but it's
kind of I feel like that's just gonna
get messy as I like eat and drink coffee
and stuff so again like I said I think
this is too much oh oh it's got some
coverage though I'm just gonna kind of
blend out the sides like a freaking
painting Wow okay so Jessica you didn't
do a very good job of blending I'm like
looking in the mirror like that looks
great and then I put it on the camera
I'm like nah anyway regardless um pretty
darn impressed with this this performs
better than let me show you so this it
cosmetics bye bye breakout i've been
putting on there and I do feel like
concealed a bit and it didn't make it
look crusty which I really appreciate
whereas I think if I'd put this on there
early on in the process of I think if I
put this on it would have just looked
really crepey and cracki and gross and I
just I would almost rather see a little
redness than see a ton of dryness so I
think like early on in breakouts I like
to use this but then like right now
where it's just red but it's kind of but
it's basically healed and gone like it
doesn't hurt anymore anything like that
I think that's the ideal time to use
this in holy moley
it says serious coverage on there that
is no joke
you
oh I'm trying out the Ulta plush drama
mascara I got it like everywhere I've
tried to clean it up but I like have to
go so I'm like that's just gonna have to
do but like literally that's me trying
to remove it oh my gosh but really I
didn't like the wand on this but it ends
up having a pretty nice volumizing
effect that's two coats it just kind of
flings everywhere you know what I mean
but I like the effect so I'll have to
show you guys maybe a close-up I'll just
show you the brush really quick so this
is the brush I don't typically like how
its spaced out like that but somehow it
still worked and I like the packaging of
this as well good morning I feel like
Minnie Mouse today I don't know why it's
like extra sticky-uppy anyway I'm trying
you guys know I'm trying a bunch of uLTA
Beauty products I'm kind of prepping for
an Ulta Beauty video in the last two
items I bought that I hadn't so one of
them that I already put on my face today
is the Ulta fabulous face primer
foundation primer it's just a clear very
silicone like classic primer it's smooth
right over my skin and smoothed it out
it felt really really nice and then I'm
trying this foundation it's their HD
soft focused liquid foundation they did
have testers out so I bought light warm
it's a kind of more liquidy foundation
but I'm using my L'Oreal blender I've
already applied it to like the bottom
half of my face so you can kind of see
again you can still see through it so I
think medium coverage maximum maybe even
lower than that so I haven't done my
forehead yet but it's blending really
easily which is nice not all foundations
that are thin blend as easily
so I'm just about done but I just pulled
out I honestly haven't used this in so
long it's the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter in opal and I just kind of
dotted it on my hand and rubbed it in
and then I use my Beauty Blender just a
corner of it and I feel like it always
looks just like really healthy and glowy
but that's kind of the easiest way I
found to apply it because any other way
it's I don't know what kind of I just
feel like it gets everywhere sometimes
I'll use a brush like a stippling brush
to apply it there a small
okay I forgot what I was gonna say good
morning oh my it's Thursday
I'm proud of myself because I made it I
worked out a little bit and made a
smoothie so I'm like I'm so healthy but
I'm not talking about how it's been ten
days since I've worked out anyway so I'm
trying out yet another new primer today
let me show you which one so if you
recall the other day I was trying the
brightening primer but today I tried the
pore reducing primer hmmm
so I have it on right now of course it's
just a primer but what I notice about it
is it's just a little bit different than
like most silicone type pore filling
primers it kind of has the same feeling
in the end but I feel like it spread
over my face a little bit easier and it
felt almost more lotion like at the
start whereas once you start kind of
rubbing it in then it kind of turns into
that velvet feel but it feels really
nice like it definitely
okay so I am continuing trying a bunch
of Ulta things you guys are gonna get
either annoyed or excited it's
affordable so that's why I get excited
and I just feel like it's like an
unexplored territory for me and for a
lot but I just put on their full
coverage liquid concealer it says it's
waterproof
now I blended it a little bit more than
you really had to just because like I
feel like I could have stopped blending
and it would have looked even more
flawless cuz like I said you can still
see but I feel like I really like this
concealer this is probably the fourth
fifth time I've used it so I'm still
deciding but I just feel like it blends
in very nicely and I could put more on
and I don't think it would look too
crepe I guess what I'm saying is I feel
like you could really amp it up and have
like a full coverage look or you could
wear for every day it's kind of it can
kind of do both and I think the doe foot
is comfortable to use as well and I just
really like it
okay so I need your guys's help because
I've had this like patch of dry skin
right there
I switched up like the makeup remover I
was using I switched back to something
I've used for years that I love so I
know and I switched back like a month
ago so anyway long story short I I
basically put took all my skincare and
went back to what I used to use that
I've been using for years so that was
like three to four weeks ago and I feel
like everything else is back to normal
but not that so I'm just needing product
recommendations for like I don't know if
I need a different or better eye cream
but it's it's driving me crazy because
it affects the primer I use on my eyes
and the shadow and the look it's just so
dry and crepey chip good morning hmm so
I just found like the smoothest primer
I've ever used
I'm clearly on like primer trial week
and number two I've been trying so many
primers so it's this kula dawn patrol
classic primer it has SPF 30 it's a
clear kind of silicon velvet feel but it
smoothes like it freakin glides over
your face and oh my gosh like it it
feels like the smoothest primer I've
ever used in my entire life like it's
just wild like I can't stop feeling my
face I need to stop so I can actually
put foundation on but it feels so smooth
but I love it has SPF of 30 in it too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
