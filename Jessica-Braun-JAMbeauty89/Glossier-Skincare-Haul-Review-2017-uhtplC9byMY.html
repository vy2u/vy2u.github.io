share with you guys my review and the
best and worst of glossier
skincare so let's go ahead and get into
it so glossier is amazing because they
don't sell that many products yet and
yet the products they sell are very well
curated they really put time and effort
and thought into what they're putting
out there and they're not just putting
out a bunch of stuff like some companies
do where some of them are hits some of
them are misses they really make some
amazing products and you know I was just
kind of tired of hearing everyone talk
about it and not having tried it myself
especially as someone that reviews
things here on YouTube for you guys so I
finally bit the bullet they have makeup
as well I haven't dabbled in that yet I
just wanted to start with their skincare
because that's kind of what intrigued me
the most but some of their famous makeup
is like their boy brow their stretch
concealer I've heard good things there
hey let's go highlighter those are
things eventually I'm curious about let
me know your thoughts below before I
make a purchase I'm curious what you
guys think and what you recommend but
today we're going to focus on their skin
care I have five different products
we're going to talk about the first one
was the whole reason I placed the order
in the first place and that is they're
priming moisturizer this is $25 it comes
with 1.7 fluid ounces which i think is a
pretty good amount I love their
packaging they've nailed it all of their
packaging has this like light light pink
and white very clean look really cute
looks cute in photos I know it sounds
dumb but I love like opening my drawer
and seeing these products it just gets
me excited anyway but this is truly more
of a moisturizer than a primer I think
the name priming in it is a little bit I
don't want to say misleading but it
definitely this is definitely a
moisturizer but I think it makes sense
in a way that they call it their priming
moisturizer because it is a great
moisturizer to put on before you put on
makeup I have used this just straight up
as a primer and it it's okay but I
typically will use a primer with it even
still and I just use this as my
moisturizer but I love this because I
use in the morning I don't use it at
night I use in the morning just before
my makeup and I'll show you a demo right
now of me putting it on today and it
only takes about a minute for it to sink
in so put this on go grab my morning
coffee and then by the time I'm back
it's sunk into my skin my skin is so
moisturized and it's ready for makeup
application so I love this stuff this
doesn't have a scent that I remember and
it's just comfortable I really I think
it's comfortable it's gonna be really
great to travel with because I know
nothing's gonna really happen too it's
just night in a tube not in a jar
because I hate when things are in jars
cuz the light and the oxygen and your
fingers getting into it's all bad for
the ingredients in it so love this stuff
definitely recommend as a moisturizer
not as a primer next product I love is
their bomb.com it's $12 they have
flavored ones I just went for the
original because I wanted to try it it's
a very petroleum jelly type formula it's
very very thick way thicker than I
thought you can put it you know you can
put it on dry skin anywhere I've just
been using on my lips it's like I said
very thick not a glossy finish to it at
all so it's even good I think for guys
lips I think my husband would actually
like this a lot and you can see me
applying it there and you see it really
is not a glossy finish but I love
putting this on at night in the morning
anytime it's just so deeply moisturizing
in my opinion and my lips look so good
ever since I started using this I really
feel like it's that really good lip balm
it's protecting your lips against the
elements you know wind and things like
that in the winter so highly recommend I
do want to try the flavored kinds not
flavored but like scented kinds yeah it
actually does say flavored interesting
next product that has been hugely hyped
is their milky jelly cleanser this is
one that you know if I'm calling this
the best and worst of glossier I guess
this would lean towards the worst but
not because it's bad but mostly because
I just don't think it's worth the price
this is where's the price $18 just for
this six fluid ounces okay $18 like
that's kind of bordering on like
high-end skincare and it's just a
cleanser the thing about cleansers is
it's the
I'm just going to say it it's the least
important step in your skincare yes you
want to skin a cleanser that gets your
makeup off but I typically use something
else to get my makeup off and then I
cleanse my skin with a cleanser I like
that this is gentle I like that it
doesn't dry your skin out but if you've
tried the my favorite the seer of a
hydrating cleanser that stuff is a
little bit cheaper for weigh more or it
might even be around the same price but
you get way more now it's got to be
cheaper anyway that stuff is amazing
very very similar because it's gentle
it's so hydrating it doesn't dry your
skin out and this certainly does not a
lot of people say oh yeah totally like
removes your makeup it doesn't say it
does on here I don't think it removes
makeup by any means but like I said
that's not what I use cleanser for I'm
using cleanser to like once I've got
most of the makeup off I use it to get
the extra off and to just clean my skin
that makes sense anyway so I like it I
will certainly use it up like if I had a
gift card I would buy it again it's not
a bad product but I just don't think
it's worth that price tag I really don't
go for this year of a one I'll link it
below it's it's like the same thing
alright so the next product is the super
bounce serum it says it's got hyaluronic
acid and vitamin b5 this one retails for
$28 $28 and it's only half of an ounce
but unfortunately it's really good I
like literally when I tried it I was so
glad it was good but then part of me is
like no but it's so expensive and now
I'm gonna want to buy it again but
there's something about this serum that
first of all again the packaging suckers
you in it's like light purple light pink
and white so cute but you know it's got
that kind of a dropper but you only need
it a little bit and you just kind of
push it into your skin and it does make
your skin feel like I don't want to say
plumped but it makes it feel plumped and
I feel like my skin looks so good right
now because in part to this and man I
know hyaluronic acid my skin really
likes hyaluronic acid so I've been kind
of looking for more and more skincare
but I really
we really like this stuff now they have
other serums they have the super glow
and the super pure for me let me read
the claims on the super bounce says
plumps skin up with moisture and vitamin
b5 brings back elasticity for supple
softness the bounce you want good for
skin depleted from hangovers long
layovers blasting AC or high high heat
so it's kind of those things that all
year round you know when you're in heat
or you're an AC you're not getting
enough sleep
you've got like lay over so I love that
idea because this is gonna be awesome
for travel anyway I really really was
very surprised at how much I like this
stuff it's one of those products that
the first day I tried it I noticed a
difference and that gets me so excited
the last product I bought was the glossy
a priming moisturizer rich this is one
of their newer products and one of the
priciest ones this ones $35 it comes
with 1.7 fluid ounces but it's in a jar
which I don't like because like I said
earlier it's just not great for skin
care and this says it'll be good for 24
months two years of digging into this
would probably not be good anyway it is
a really nice moisturizer though do I
think it's the best moisturizer in the
world I don't think so but it's very
moisturizing it's on par it reminds me a
lot of the bee nigma one that I keep
talking about because I really really
like but that one's crazy pricey and if
you're interested in that I'll link the
video where I talked about it recently
because I do have a percent off code
which I'll put below but it's still
really pricey that stuff is like
life-changing amazing amazing skincare
this one reminds me of that it's a
really similar texture really really
thick almost like cold cream texture
really really moisturizing $35 I will
say is way cheaper than the B nigma so
if you want a cheaper I mean it's not
the same thing at all but it definitely
is a similar moisturization level this
one has a really strong scent of like it
reminds me of like cologne actually it
kind of reminds me of cold cream that
sense of cold cream makes me think of my
mom but really moisturizing really nice
do I think it's like the best thing in
the world no but it's really really nice
so if you're placing an order and you
need a really deep moisturizing skincare
this is really good for that again I
don't know why it's called
priming moisturizer because it's not a
primer and I use this at night after my
serum I don't use it in the morning
before makeup I think it's a little bit
too thick and moisturizing for that so
that's kind of my first foray into
glossier if you have any recommendations
but their skincare makeup whatever leave
it below I'm very interested and I
definitely want to place another order
especially when I run out of some of my
favorites and I inevitably need to
repurchase them I have a referral code
for glossier if you're interested I will
put it below if you don't want to use my
referral code please don't feel
pressured I will also put just the
regular glossy a link below as well I
hope that you'll subscribe if you
enjoyed these kinds of videos I just
recently did a top 5 favorite skincare
products video I will link if you're
interested in that other than that I
hope you'll catch me on my social media
in the meantime which is GM beauty 89 on
all of my accounts and I will see you
