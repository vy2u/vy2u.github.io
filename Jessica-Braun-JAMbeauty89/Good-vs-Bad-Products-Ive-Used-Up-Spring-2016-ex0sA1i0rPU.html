gonna share with you guys a ton of
empties I've got some makeup empties
some haircare skincare perfume all kinds
of things like that so let's go and get
into it so right now I'm suffering from
seasonal allergies and I know I'm not
alone and so I'm trying this I feel like
I've tried every kind of allergy
medicine under the Sun and none of them
work and right now I'm going through
that like where my ear itches and like
the roof of my mouth it isn't if you
know what I mean it like there's nothing
you can do about it like I'm constantly
like trying to edge it with my tongue
so I'm trying this it's a Chinese tea
and I can't think of the brand but it's
specifically for like allergies so we'll
see if it works right now it's really
hot but like I want to I know it'll feel
good on the roof of my mouth so let's
start with makeup empties now some of
this is kind of a de clutter of makeup
products that I've had for a while
because I love them and they're just
getting old and I'm like I've just got
to get rid of them and they're not
completely empty but they're just too
old the first one is the NARS lip gloss
and Turkish Delight I love this I've
done a dupes video where I found a dupe
for this in the drugstore so if you're
curious about what that dupe is I'll
link that video below it was a couple
months ago there were a lot of dupes in
that but it's such a pretty like kind of
creamy white pink it just looks really
nice and feminine on the lips I just
really like it but it's kind of getting
that point where it kind of smells a
little bit off and I'm like mmm I don't
want to risk it it's not worth it so I
it's time to let this go so goodbye
goodbye you expensive thing darn you
okay
the next thing is this this is another
kind of declutter this one's just
getting a little bit too old this is the
gorgeous cosmetics base perfect liquid
foundation this is one of my favorites
and it's kind of a rare one like this
company sent me a long time ago a bunch
of their products and I think this is
one of the few things I still have all
of them are really good but just decide
to clutter more and more I just wasn't
reaching for a lot of things but this is
one I love the good news is I have an
unopened backup of this so I'll be able
to just tear into that but I wear the
shade one in BB P and this works better
for me kind of now and I'm a little bit
more bronzed I mean I'm not like tan
Brady means but if you see me looking up
there there
my husband Oh Manny is the bomb he
figured out how to like hook the camera
up to our TV up there so I can actually
see like when I'm in focus and what I'm
not because like I can't film when he's
not here because the whole video is out
of focus like I don't know what's wrong
with me but it's really hard to like see
from afar anyway so I'm gonna try not to
look up there but it is kind of like
throwing me off it's very odd anyway
it's really nice it covers really well
it just has a pump kind of cheap plastic
packaging and it's kind of an expensive
foundation but it just covers really
well it doesn't break up on my skin or
oxidize or look weird and it just sits
nicely now I don't wear a foundation
every day like I used to I really do use
BB Creams so this is for like if I'm
going out to a special night and I want
high coverage I love this and this
doesn't have SPF in it that I know of so
it doesn't give weird flashback in
photos either but going kind of out of
order here this is a hair empty this is
from living proof and it's their perfect
hair day dry shampoo this stuff is so
good and I'd heard a lot of people talk
about it and I'm like okay like I've
tried ten million dry shampoos and you
know I really like the batiste ones
there are some that I've tried like I
think it was the Garnier one maybe I
didn't like or there are a couple that
I've tried to the drug sorry I just
didn't like and some that I do but you
know this was kind of pricey and I'm
like how much better can it be because
I've tried some expensive ones that
really were not great at all this one
was so good like this is one of the few
dry shampoos that when I would put it in
my hair my hair would be better with
this than it would have been the first
day the day before and it it doesn't
like feel heavy but it doesn't feel
weird like it's making it light in a
weird way it's like right in between and
it just makes your hair smell really
good and I love it this is one that I've
got like one or two dry shampoos of
another brand I want to use but once I'm
completely out of dry shampoo I think
I'm gonna purchase this because yes it's
expensive but your hair is like a big
part of your day it's a big part of the
way you look and also when it smells
really nice you just feel like put
together so I love this stuff another
hair empty is this Tresemme tray to
spray I know that emily noel loves this
stuff and i like it well enough I think
it's got good hold but I hate the smell
it's kind of that kind of classic hairs
I smell and I'm just like makes me think
of like being in show choir I don't know
so long story short it's not my favorite
now would I buy it in a pinch like if I
were not at home and I need like your
travel size I know they sell this and I
know that it works pretty well I would
still buy it again but it's certainly
not like my favorite oh my gosh this
next favorite I can't believe as a
favorite this is the yes - coconut
hydrate and restore ultra hydrating
melting cleanser now this was something
that they had sent this to me with a
couple of their other products and I
love coconut scents and there are a lot
of products recently that I've been
sharing with coconut like there's some
of you know products I am obsessed with
right now this and a couple of others
that I'm just really into coconut right
now and this one was a melting cleanser
and it threw me off because when I read
about it it said okay says try this
cleanser two ways to melt away dirt and
impurities squirt a dollop in hand and
then add water to create a creamy
emulsion or you can use it dry on your
face and then add water and it'll kind
of emulsify on your face so I've tried
it both ways but my favorite and the way
I ended up doing it for the rest of the
bottle is by just getting it dry so I
would use like something like Bioderma
or some kind of makeup remover to take
off my eye makeups and then I would just
get it squirt of this in dry hands rub
it together and just rub it all over my
face and it really felt weird doing that
because it was completely like dry and
it was just like a thick almost
petroleum jelly like feel to it anyway
and then you'd add warm water and it
would just emulsify on your face and
what I loved about it was the smell the
way it applied and the fact that it
really did remove like everything and my
skin feels so like moisturized when I'm
done every time now of course they still
put a serum and moisturizer on after it
but it just makes my skin not feel
stripped and not feel just completely
dried out and I feel like just like
looking at my skin I feel like it is so
much healthier ever since I started
using this and I really started using
serums regularly and ever since I
stopped using foundation every single
day so instead I'll use like a BB cream
or something and then maybe
put like a little bit of powder
foundation in the areas like right here
and get a lot of redness just to cover
that but other than that that's really
it
so my gosh I just talked about this
forever I'm so sorry it is awesome I
will link it below as all of these will
be linked but I love this stuff I needed
buy another one now so you saw this but
this is the bioderma sensibio h2o this
is the makeup removing micellar solution
for sensitive skin this bigger one I
bought when well let me think this one I
bought in Paris last summer this one I
bought in London last winter I bought it
in Paris to try it and we didn't have
much room in our luggage so I bought the
small and then I was like this is just
really nice because you put it on a
cotton pad you kind of hold it on your
eye and it just kind of gets into the
makeup and then you can wipe it and it
really does wipe off a lot of it without
having to scrub back and forth now I'm
not saying that one swipe get it all off
but pretty close to it
so I bought a bigger one in London when
I had more room in my luggage they're
both gone right now I'm using the
Garnier micellar water not the water
proof that the regular kind it really is
nice it does kind of steam my eyes a
little bit which I thought was kind of
weird and I can't decide if it's because
I've been using like a waterproof liquid
liner lately and it's a little bit
harder to get off that's my only guest
so there are too many variables right
now so I don't know if it's that or not
so I think once I run out of the Garnier
I might go back to this I don't know I
don't know but the Garnier really is
nice another makeup empty is the dr.
jart
BB plus or the BB beauty balm and it's
got SPF of 45 this is the one obviously
in the gold tube this one is amazing
because I love the packaging it looks
like a squeezy two but it's not it's got
a pump it's the BB cream that got me
into BB Creams because there are so many
egg treads from the drugstore I'm like
oh my gosh like I don't like the way any
of these make my skin feel except for I
did find one I'll tell you about it in
my April favorites video but anyway it
was the first one that made me fall in
love with BB cream because it was kind
of a gray tone and I felt like every BB
cream I ever tried even made my skin
look orange or just did nothing and this
one had a little bit of coverage but not
a lot because it's not a foundation and
it didn't make my skin orange or look
weird and oxidize or make it look too
oily or too dry it was just right and I
just fell in love with this so I've
since bought the Black Label it's called
like
Black Label detox and it's the dr. jart
beauty balm minutes and of course a
black tube and it is really nice too it
has less SPF that one's got SPF 25 so
I'm kind of trying each and deciding but
I was really sad when this was gone
this one was gone it's really pricey but
you guys if you've tried so many BB
creams and you're tired of spending your
money on it and constantly being
disappointed you really should try this
it lasted a surprising amount of time
and it was absolutely wonderful alright
next empty is this is the misty or Oda
parfum
this looks disgusting it's like rusted
and gross like it's really gross there's
a little bit left but it is completely
changed scent I'm like it's time it's
not worth it still smells kind of good
but every time I'd worn it the past few
weeks before I decided it was time it
just didn't smell all the way it used to
smell now I've decided I can't buy
perfumes that are like 3.4 ounces any
more because they always end up going
bad before I use them and I use perfume
every single day and I'm not even like
like I sprayed decent amount hon
probably too much but I want it to last
for a little while this stuff it just it
took me too long now missed you or it's
one of my favorites I think this is one
that I might buy again once I've used up
I have two perfumes right now I really
don't want to have more than two because
I've realized I used to have like four
or five and I'm like this is crazy I
don't need this many options I know what
since I like and usually I would end up
reaching for the same one or two anyway
so I finally have narrowed it down to
two and I love those two so I love this
as well once I run out of one of those I
might buy this again just a smaller one
another kind of makeup empty is this lip
balm one of my favorites it's the nukes
or knucks I never know I think you guys
all said it was nukes Rev de miel lip
balm and it's just a pot there's like a
little tiny bit left I might try and use
that before I truly get rid of it but
it's just a really thick weird
consistency of a lip balm but once you
really get into it because the first few
uses are weird it takes a while to kind
of almost like warm this thing up but I
went through it quickly which is good
because since it's in a pot I don't want
to have something like this for months
and months because you're constantly
dipping your finger into it's kind of
gross but I love this I've tried the
kindness in a tube and it's just not
quite the same I liked it but not nearly
as much as this this makes my lips feel
so soft and
I have big lips they tend to get chapped
really easily and this is kind of like
nip that in the bud I feel like all
winter long my lips were awesome because
of this I now have like five of these
around the house
all right last few makeup empties this
one is my Lancome Hypnose drama mascara
this stuff is so good the wand is kind
of curbs like a little bits got kind of
a divot but it's not really big just
kind of natural bristles it is just
amazing it adds volume it's really black
it stays the same it holds the curl it
does everything you want a mascara to do
now I bought the Lancome Lancome Lancome
Hypnose mascara not as good in fact I
used it today it's okay but it's just
not nearly as good as the Hypnose drama
for me and what I like so definitely
when those run out and I've got a couple
other mascaras I'm trying out too so I
don't need to buy anytime soon but that
is like the number one recommendation
for a mascara last one is the Maybelline
lash discovery mini brush waterproof
this is one of the most amazing mascaras
it's this tiny tiny brush it is amazing
at I use it to kind of prime my lashes
I'll use this first and it'll separate
them all already add you know some kind
of definition I'll definitely do my
bottom lashes with it and then I'll take
another mascara to go over it now you
don't even need another mascara with
this because if you put a couple coats
it just looks gorgeous it makes your
lashes look really long like I said it
separates them because of the tiny brush
I love this so I'm I don't have one in
my collection right now so I need to buy
it again I constantly buy it it is so so
so good one more empty these are the up
and up makeup remover cleansing
towelettes
I bought this kind of I just needed some
a few months ago and I actually there
were 25 I don't use these daily wipe my
makeup off I actually use them to wipe
swatches off this is the last one I'm
using right now it was good I mean I'm
not really picky about makeup tell us
because I'm not using on my face now if
I did I probably would be but I just I
just don't I used to I just don't
anymore not really for any reason I just
kind of stopped once I tried like
micellar water and I was like just like
that so I just don't use it
hey you those are all of my empties for
right now hopefully you enjoyed this I
love filming these because I get to show
you guys what I'm really loving and
maybe some things that I tried the whole
thing and I really just didn't like it I
didn't want to
purchase it but a lot of these I feel
like in my last empties video there were
a lot of products I didn't like that I
wouldn't repurchase but this one was
kind of filled with a lot of favorites
so I think because I have downsized a
lot now I'm stuck with a lot of products
I love so as I'm finishing I'm like yeah
I loved that yes I love that because
they were ones I kept because I loved
them so that is always a great feeling
hopefully you enjoyed this video and I
hope that you'll subscribe to catch more
of my makeup in beauty videos and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
