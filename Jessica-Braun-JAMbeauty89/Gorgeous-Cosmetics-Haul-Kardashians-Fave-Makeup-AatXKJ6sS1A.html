bringing you a haul from gorgeous
cosmetics and I had never heard of this
brand and they sent me this stuff and
they're not sponsoring me or anything
they just sent it to me and I was like
as I searched for it more on YouTube I
found that there really wasn't a lot
about it and as I researched this more
this brand was featured like on Keeping
Up with Kardashian's at one point I've
never seen it but that's I saw like
screenshots of them likes watching this
stuff or I don't know and so there's
like a little bit of buzz around it but
there's not a lot out there about the
specific products and plus they're
really really pricey so this is
something that if you were actually
wanting to splurge and buy one of these
items you'd probably want to know how
they are before you buy it that's how I
buy high-end I research the crap out of
it so that being said that's what the
purpose in this video is just to show
you about these products that are out
there that I didn't even know existed so
let's go ahead and get into it so I
mentioned that gorgeous cosmetics was a
little pricier they're sold on their own
site which I can link below I think it's
like gorgeous cosmetics calm or
something simple like that but I also
saw they're sold on Nordstrom now every
time I buy something on Nordstrom I
always use my Ebates account because you
get cash back and right now they're
doing something I don't know how long
it's lasting but they were doing a 16
percent cash back which is a big deal if
you don't know about Ebates I talk about
it so much that I have to like catch
myself but it's amazing you just sign up
and you get cash back on things you're
gonna buy anyway online it's it's really
simple they walk you through it but I
can leave my link below it is a referral
link but it's amazing anyway so that's
where it's sold the first thing I want
to show you is I think one of their most
famous products and it is their 8 pan
palette in their ever metallic shades so
there are 8q mungus eyeshadows in this
palette and the palette is really I
think when you look at it it doesn't
look that well made I don't know I mean
I la I like the packaging but if you
actually hold it it's really hefty and
you can tell it's well made so I think
that's what surprised
first and foremost but these pans are
actually humongous let me see if I've
got like a Mac shadow to compare it here
we go so this is a matte shadow compared
to these the Mac Shot I mean it's still
a decent size but these are absolutely
huge so I wanted to show you a few
swatches because these are so buttery
and just absolutely I mean they're
shimmery they're just gorgeous and it's
kind of one of those things that they
blend so well together it's just it
looks it feels to me like my Marc Jacobs
shadows too and I only have one palette
in one of the shadows in that palette
it's terrible
but they all I'm actually wearing Marc
Jacobs the Marc Jacobs palette today
they blend so well together it's like it
doesn't take any work and that's how
these feel to me so I'm really excited
to try these out and perhaps review them
and do like a whole swatch video of it
but I was really impressed I'm excited
to try this some more they also sent
their gorgeous cosmetics
powder perfect pressed powder and again
the packaging this one is black but it
has that kind of NARS feeling to the
packaging and it says gorgeous on it
kind of embossed in it and it feels more
like the powder foundation is that what
it says it's a press powder but it has
it feels as though it's got the coverage
of more of a powder foundation it feels
really nice so I'm excited to give that
a try I haven't been using powder a lot
in my routine however as summer
approaches I think I you know I'll be
I'll certainly be oily or more oily
which one's correct I don't know so I
probably will need more of a pressed
powder so I'm actually excited to try
that they also sent two of their
lipsticks I was really excited I'm
actually wearing one today I'm wearing
whimsey which again this packaging is
really hefty and nice and it's just a
sleek black style square I assume the
other day sorry where we were learning
about rectangular prisms and he asked me
if there was such a thing as a sqrt
angular prism and I have giggled about
that so much because it's just so cute
anyway there is and it's called a cube
but anyway so it's kind of a
angular packaging and just really really
nice and kind of heavy but the color is
one that I don't own anything like this
color it it's almost like a purplish
grayish pink and when I say grayish I
mean grayish I don't know how it's like
a taupe pink but it's so beautiful and
it glides on so smooth and I wore this
this morning before teaching and it
lasted quite a while and it never really
felt crazy or dry so I mean I've only
worn it once this makes twice but I like
it so far and I really and that color
was whimsy I don't remember if I said
and then the other one they sent is
bombshell which I haven't even swatch
this yet I'm really excited looks like a
bright fuchsia yes it is oh my gosh look
at that so that's amazing
oh I'm excited about that one I might
bring that on my honeymoon I don't know
I'd say that about like everything I'm
never I don't know how I'm ever gonna
pick what I actually bring on this
three-week trip I don't know how I'm
happy so those were I was very excited
they also sent to their lashes you guys
know I'm not big on lashes but they're
the well they're they're Madame lash
eyelashes okay and these are the Jane's
and they're just kind of a little more
sparse if you will and then these are
the minis which has a lot more lash to
them again I don't wear lashes lashes
often slash ever but good to know that
they sell them in case you were curious
um in the band on them I mean they look
like they're actually pretty nice to be
honest with you I don't know I'm not
really a lash snob so I'm not really the
person to ask about that so they also
sent a lip liner and I wore this I'm
wearing this underneath this and it's in
the shade Kiana it's Qi a na Kiana and
it's their lip pencil and I actually
lined and then fill in my lips and I
love the color of this because it's kind
of like a light peachy color I have it
right in between those like I don't
again it's like a nude but it's again
almost more grey like I just love that
so I was very excited
is very creamy and so far it hasn't
moved outside my lip line I don't know I
haven't worn it long enough but again
anything you want reviews on let me know
below the ones you're kind of the most
interested in so they also sent Oh
apparently this is another one of their
bestsellers this is their base perfect
liquid foundation I love the packaging I
love the way the pump looks I haven't
used it yet I haven't swatched it yet
would it be called a swash with
foundation I guess but it's just
everything feels so well-made which it
should be because it's expensive I just
can't believe I've never heard this
brand come on they sent me the shade
while I'm doing this one in B BP I don't
know come on
okay so here's the color actually might
be a good feels very liquidy although
that was the very first pump ever out of
it so I don't really know but it
certainly covers it might be a little
too dark on me I don't know but it feel
it already okay so I just want it in
with my hand it already feels like soft
it doesn't feel tacky at all like some
of my favorite foundations I have to
admit are really tacky and I have to set
them with like a loose powder before I
can even put like blush and bronzer on
but this one instantly feels like soft
like a baby's bottom I'm not even
kidding you so that's pretty cool
excited to try that tomorrow on my face
so that was exciting to get into try
they also sent a few like random things
and then they also sent like a whole kit
I'm going to show you the kit that they
sent at the end so they also sent some
of their like shimmer dusts they sent
two shades of their shimmer dust there's
Sam shimmer and this one looks well I
don't know it looks kind of like a
peachy gold shimmer yeah so it's right
there oh that looks really pretty that
looks like Cielo kitten to me and then
they also sent suede its
this this one looks a little darker oh
it's just a little more cool toned I
think it's not darker at all cops or no
it's a little more pink tone that's what
it is
so suede is underneath can you guys see
I don't know they're all blending
together so that is suede and that is
sand shimmer really really pretty
um like really pretty you're like really
pretty like really pretty oh so you
agree you think you're pretty thumbs up
if you know what movie that's from okay
so those were those sand shimmers there
didn't seem to be like crazy fallout or
anything like that but for me I would
apply it with my finger if I were you
and so then they they also sent a color
flash in opal and I think this is
supposed to be a glitter so I'll be
careful it looks like a kind of darker
yeah it's like a deeper colored glitter
pretty cool now I do know they sent this
what does it call glitz fix and I think
this supposed to be like a glitter glue
type primer maybe you put it yeah so you
you would put this down it's just clear
you can't see it and then you put the
glitter on top of it yeah and it doesn't
move so that is nice I have something
like an elf glitter primer but I don't
use glitter all that often so I haven't
really tried it but that I like the
format of this that it's not a squeezy
tube that you can kind of brush it on
with the doe foot applicator so that is
pretty cool and it I think that really
is having some sort of glitter primer or
glitter glue like that it really is an
essential in a makeup collection at
least having one like I said elf sells
one to for a couple bucks on the website
okay so moving forward they also sent a
liner this is their eyeliner pen it's
called eye line like the letter I and
I'm pretty sure it's in black so it's a
felt tip applicator
oh it's instantly really really black
Wow
I will say I'm noticing right away that
it's the first initial one is bleeding
no they're both are they are bleeding
outside of their little lines so that I
mean to me that really is a big deal
because when I am lining especially with
something like this I want it to be very
precise so when it's bleeding out even a
little bit I mean it can make everything
look so sloppy now of course that was
the very first time I've ever done it so
I don't know but I don't know most
winders I have don't do that
I'm just saying so I I don't know if
that one would be worth the splurge then
again it might get better after a few
uses after it kind of dries a bit but I
would say maybe spend your money
elsewhere they also send another liner
but this one's a pencil one it's called
their eye I again liquid eye pencil in
carbon black I'm trying to get it like a
few different so that's you know a
couple back and forth that's just one it
up it's not the blackest line I've ever
seen it is like especially up close it
is a little more grey do I think it
would be great just to kind of if you're
just using it to tightline sure because
if you know you're putting like for me I
put a cream eyeliner on top of it no
matter what anyway so I would still use
this but do I think it's worth the price
tag probably not I would say so far
everything's been great but the
eyeliners just from my first impression
I'm not impressed with those so that is
my honest opinion of those so now going
into the kit that they sent it's called
their Royal Regalia
limited edition palette I guess so
there's like a palette in there and some
lip products it looks like I'm excited
it's got a lot of purple and the bag is
purple and really well made it says
gorgeous cosmetics on it so let's see
what's in here we'll start with the
palette again it's got that same symbol
but this is how yeah about half the size
of the big one I showed you earlier but
just as hefty and new so it's got again
those purples but I am loving these two
shades right ciao
gosh you can almost use this eyeshadow
as a contour I mean look at the Koala
might be a little warmer tone than what
I would use but it's so pigmented
I mean oh my gosh you could totally whoa
I just had to blend it out
that is a beautiful mid-tone Brown
though this is the kind of shimmering
white no that is nice it's just got to
be a
right light it's just really pearlescent
it's not necessarily a stark white no
I'm still not really impressed with that
white one even looking at it again but
let's swatch these purple ones because
since this is limited edition if you
wanted it you'd probably have to get it
soon and I want you to see what it's
like so those are the other two puffles
the deeper purple squatched well the
lighter purple well man I I just want
that brown shade the oven three I'm not
totally in love with of course watching
is very different than actually using
with the brush and blending so these
might be amazing and I will say some of
my favorite palettes are not the most
pigmented things in the world like the
L'Oreal a palette one is one of my
favorite palettes of all time ever and
honestly some of my favorite shades
aren't very pigmented when you swatch
them but they're amazing on the eyes so
I don't want to judge this one by its
cover and I will say that mid-tone Brown
is one of the best i ever squatched in
my life so that is amazing so new
they've got like four lip products and
then this eye liner it's one of their
mmm I can't really see it it's all
written it it's there I ain't glick what
I pencil so it's the same thing but it's
in like a purple shape ooh this was a
lot better and it's really got a kind of
a metallic quality to it as well so I
like this one a lot better that's fun
and then the lip I guess it's all lip
glosses isn't it lip lacquer let me make
sure they're all got lip lacquer and lip
lacquer lip lacquer yeah they're all lip
lacquers so let's start with this
deepest one this one's in berry it's got
a dough fit out there these are the size
of a mac lipglass just for reference
they're not like long they're the size
of a Mack lip gloss so they're kind of
like they almost look like little
shortened versions of them Wow this is
more of a brown purple than a blueish
purple it really is all Nolan's violet
I have it honestly that's rare to see in
a lip gloss so that's interesting would
I wear it maybe if I dresses Alvira for
Halloween which actually that could be
fun but it is really pigmented and if
you're looking for one this color I mean
does it have a smell did I get my nose
in it oh I didn't okay
let me see though they're just literally
no smell whatsoever which is kind of
nice okay this one looks amazing this is
in the shade magenta and it just looks
like a beautiful it almost looks like a
coral pink yeah kind of a warm pink
color these are so pigmented it's crazy
they are called lip lacquers so their
lacquers typically are more like a paint
almost like kind of a cross between a
gloss and a paint so another deeper
vampy color is in plum I'm gonna put
this next to that other one oh yeah this
one is more of a bear who I like this
one you guys know what I never realized
a lot of you guys say yeah I'm Jessica
I'm so used to seeing you in berry lip
color so I'm like I didn't really say
we're berry lip colors that often and as
I've gone back through my videos I'm
like I guess I do I didn't realize I
guess how much I like berry lips and I
think it's cuz when I'm teaching I'm I'm
not gonna wear that color so I like
playing dress-up here so that's when I
get to wear my bold colors that would be
my guest look at that that's the top one
I really like that one a lot it's such a
beautiful color and it's you wouldn't
guess it'd be that color from the tube
and then the last one is just a clear
one I'm not gonna well I could swatch it
just to see if it's like weird but no
and none of these feel sticky or
anything like that at all so I'm very
appreciative of that and they'd all have
a weird smell so those four were the
ones that came in the kit so I would
think all in all like if you were
actually to place an order or if you're
watching this just because you were
genuinely searching for gorgeous
cosmetics like what to buy and you're
not necessarily one of my regular
subscribers that watches my videos I
would recommend their eyeshadows
probably the bigger palettes and that's
the thing about limited edition they're
not always the best quality I don't want
to say that across the board that's true
but that happens a lot but I would say
stick with their kind of traditional
palettes I know they have a few
different kinds the lipsticks felt
really really nice so those would be
maybe just picking out one color that
you know you'd really like cuz they're
really well made and they felt really
nice on my lips other than that I mean
I would say maybe not the eyeliners I
did really like this lipliner so maybe
you get a lipstick and a lip liner
together the lip gloss is felt really
nice the shadow like the shimmery things
I'm it's not I'm not big into them so
but they felt really nice so if you are
looking for one I mean it might be worth
a try but like I said I would say the
eyeliners maybe stay away from I am
excited to try this foundation because
it felt so nice and not tacky but I'll
have to get back to you on this because
I don't want to recommend this without
having a clue how it looks on my face
although I'm recommending the shadows
and I haven't tried them on my eyes but
regardless hold like this was helpful
was more of a haul and the first
impressions than anything else let me
