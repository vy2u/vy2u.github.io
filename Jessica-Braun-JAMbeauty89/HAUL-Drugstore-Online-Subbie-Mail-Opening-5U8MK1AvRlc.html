literally nothing better than getting a
package in the mail or you get a letter
anything it's just the bomb you know
what I'm saying okay calm down yes just
calm down okay so I have some other
things that I bought recently I don't
even know where to begin we'll start
with hope look I just ordered this the
other day and it came so quickly and
usually what look is terrible about
getting things like quickly you don't
understand so um I ordered this it's
from the brand dog-eared and it's this
little gold I guess I could take it out
necklace and these are actually kind of
pricey for what they are but on their it
was obviously a pretty good deal and
it's called the unlocked necklace and
it's this cute little gold chain I think
it's 16 inches it might be 18 but it
looks like it's 16 but it's just got
this cute little um like I don't even on
to the scribe that like a little keyhole
thing and it's so cute
I'm really excited about that because I
wear this necklace all the time and this
one people have asked I got at Kohl's by
the way on a really good deal and I've
just been wanting a more dainty gold one
and I am
in love with this but I think because I
like the idea of key necklaces and I
used to have one but it broke so this is
even cuter because it's like the little
keyhole I just I don't know I just like
fell in love with it but also this was
new for me
Publix sent like this with it like a you
know a trial racer thing which is
awesome and I'm gonna use it but it was
just interesting I've never gotten that
from them so that was kind of a nice
surprise looks like today cuz I'm
looking at the box thinking okay this is
just a little necklace it's way too big
of a box or a waist okay so that's all I
order from hautelook and it came really
fast which is nice
another thing I got from a store near me
called Meyer I don't know if you've
heard of the brand Waldo pancake I've
heard of it and I was seeing it just
like funny cute stuff you know it's like
funny phrases on them this is a magnetic
bookmark you know I've been loving those
but I've been wanting a long one and
this one's super super long so it really
doesn't fall out and it was on clearance
for two bucks but it says upside-down
bookmark hop get it and you know I also
got some for my nephew's and they love
them there's there were a lot of funny
ones and I should I really feel like I
said about more than one but I'm trying
to only read one book at a time so
anyway okay so that's that from Target I
got this shirt oh and it's like if I can
see it up not with you over it's like
you know just a coffee sure but it's
like loot well hello it's like looser
here and it's just comfortable and
v-necks I'm just loving because you can
wear like a necklace with them without
it being like right at your neckline you
know what I mean and this is four
dollars come on
I love freaking Target you guys don't
you just love Target and for those that
come on targets near them I'm so sorry
cuz I talk about Target a lot and I know
but I got a new deodorant I've never
tried clear now I've tried some of the
natural ones and boy howdy those really
don't work on me I want to try the LA
fresh or la vanilla it's not the same
brand I don't know but I want to try the
those those types of deodorant because
I've heard they're actually pretty
effective and I think they're gonna be
on HauteLook
tomorrow if I'm right which might be
today on Saturday so anyway but I'm
gonna try the secret outlast clear gel
it's in the I don't know what so so
we'll see you know then I also this
poignant dollar 77 it's
Gillette satin care it's infused with
Olay and it's a shave gel and I usually
get the EOS one that's like in the
little pump but they run out so fast
and they're nice but they're I don't
know I just wanted to try something
different and I love pretty much
anything I've tried from Olay or with LA
I love think about my covergirl and Olay
concealer I love that stuff so much so I
figured hey this might be the same thing
for my legs I don't know anyway oh so
guys it's Friday when I'm filming as I
could not be happy that it's Friday whoo
so anyway so those were like just some
new kind of Rando products that I'm
gonna be using and then I went to CVS
because they're like a jillion things
you could get like a Dillian extra bucks
for like buying things so like this was
$4.99 but then I got four dollars in
extra bucks back I was like yup so I
actually love this stuff I think it
really really works this is the crest 3d
white mouthwash and then I also got the
crest 3d white toothpaste in the radiant
mint and it was another thing it was
like $2.99 you get $2 extra bucks it was
all said and done I got like 16 dollars
in extra bucks back so that was awesome
okay I got some wet and wild stuff I got
this trio which was inspired by
Instagram because someone posted this I
wish I can remember who and they were
comparing it to another shadow and it
looked like it it looked like it could
be a dupe for Urban Decay's half-baked
that's in The Naked 1 palette and so I
bought it for that gold color and that
gold color is beautiful but I'm gonna go
ahead and swatch all of these because
get ready for the beautiful beautiful
pink oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
isn't that beautiful
I mean the goal is pretty in the dark is
pretty but that pink I'm like yup can't
wait to use it so this is the path sorry
it's the trio called I'm getting
sunburned and it's so so pretty and I
told myself I do not need any more
eyeshadows but look at the swatch of
those can you see them I need I need I
need to wipe off okay anyway so then
from what Val also I got this the Wet n
Wild mega last color in on yeah on a
trip it's just so cute I want to put it
on my toes and then I just got a white
one I don't have a white nail polish and
if you put a white or a lighter nail
under like a glitter one it's just gonna
make it pop even more I'm just the same
as you use like a white eyeshadow base
and it's gonna make the eyeshadow pop
even more you know like the NYX jumbo
pencil and like milk so then I got this
I'm finally doing it the Revlon
Photoready BB cream I've heard mixed
things I just want to try it I want to
know for myself what it's like I got it
in the shade light we'll see how it goes
plus I got extra bucks so I was like
that might as well and then I
instagrammed a picture that Orly was off
50% off and everyone was like no I was
like okay calm down everybody
no um so I've got it went there I want
to go back and see was anymore I only
got one shade it's in the shake lollipop
it's like a lavender almost pink color
not like a lavender like a lilac name
I'll be the same it's really pretty
and this is my first Orly nail polish
than that crazy
I'm excited to give it a try I was
clearly in a purple mood anyway and so
then these all my things were 75% off
and I had like dollar off coupons and
things like that
didn't I get another thing from I did
where is it oh there it is oh okay so
this ended up being like two dollars
it's the intense eye color shadow stick
and it's in the for brown eyes shade and
it's got this green and then this like
kind of light bronze or champagne color
I don't know I figure out for two bucks
I'm gonna try it and then I had a
document I was like one dollar and then
I also got the all my wake up eyeliner
and highlighter and it's in sapphire
splash and ice diamonds so there's like
the sapphire liner here and then this
like white thicker shadow stick I don't
know I I will see how I like them I'll
let you guys know and then all my has
new lip glosses out and I've heard good
things about these they look like this
I'm not really sure what they're called
but you'll know it when you see them and
this is in the shade blooming and it's
just this really pretty pink and they
smell really really good kind of vanilla
II kind of ride to be like the mac
lipglass smell kinda but they're you
know like five or six dollars and
they're just so cute
I'll probably get more because there's
like a peach shade so that's what I got
at CVS okay we have one more thing oh my
gosh so I went to be flirt calm
like probably not show my address huh
there's it's be flirt FL you rt.com
and they have like Mac products in there
like legit it's not like a CD website
where you're probably not getting my
friend actually is Mac products um and
Laura Mercier and Bobby Brown and
virtually anything you can think of they
have Smashbox Urban Decay Stila tart but
the thing is the products go in and out
there you know what I mean it's not like
they always have a base of things it's
different products all the time because
they have a limited supply and once
those run out they run out but there
comes together things in so it's kind of
fun because you can check back every
month or every couple weeks and there's
like new Mac products and new shadow
shades and stuff so they have a lot of
Mac stuff on there so in like I said
it's a good deal which is why I bought
this stuff first though I got the NYX
eyebrow shaper it's just like a wax
stick that you can use to shape because
I don't like using the clear gloss I
feel like it just feels weird and it
never looks right so I thought this
might be a better option for me so I
went with that and then I'm excited to
show you all this stuff I mean so
excited about this up I finally
purchased the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer I know a lot of people love
the silk cream foundation but I've also
heard great things about the tinted
moisturizer which I was just a little
bit more interested in it's pretty big
these are originally like in the 40s but
I think I ended up getting it for like
under 30 because if it's like a 30
percent off sale off of the already
lower prices you don't understand that
sounded like a Walmart coming here so
anyway um so I got it in the color nude
I think for the summertime that'll be a
good color I think year-round it might
not be will see um so I'm really excited
about this because it has an S F sorry
SPF of 20 or anything and then okay on
to the Mac products oh so I got two
different blushes and I'm so excited
this is in the color damn these are both
colors that just I've heard good things
about and I think most of us you do a
lot of research before especially if
you're gonna spend the money you do a
lot of research and these are colors I
knew I've been wanting so this is Dame
and it's kind of like a just a very
light pink color you know it seems like
it's gonna be a really pretty I don't
think you're gonna be able to see the
swatch there's no way just like a pretty
flush of color you know like when you
don't really walk that look a blush but
you want to look just fresh I think this
is gonna be gorgeous for that so that
was Dame and then the next one I got was
well-dressed which my goodness if
everyone and their mother doesn't talk
about this one it's like I gotta try it
come on let's be real this seems very
similar today it's also a light pink you
notice a trend because I have so many
peach colored blushes that's like I've
got to get some like pinks in there this
I think is maybe almost like a little
more pigmented maybe that's just on my
finger you know but I'm gonna compare
this to actually now that I'm thinking
about it so on my pointer finger is
well-dressed okay and then on my middle
finger is gonna be Dane so on your left
oh no I don't know this one is Dame no
yes
oh my gosh this one's well-dressed this
one is Dave that was hilarious they look
very similar I don't even know if you'll
be able to see the difference but it
looks like well dress is almost a little
bit more cool toned I can tell you right
now it's definitely a little more hold
up but they're both really really pretty
and so I'm really excited to play with
those because they're beautiful
pigmentation okay then I also got a mac
lipglass in fresh air and this um it
just looked like a kind of a frosty
color which I usually don't go for not
too frosty though like I don't know I
just look really really pretty um here
it is up here that was an awkward place
to swatch if you guys can even see that
I don't know it just seems really really
pretty I thought might have more but you
know there's kind of a small I was gonna
say small the earlier they smelled like
nice but and then the last thing I got
is the Mac Studio Fix powder plus
foundation I got mine in NC 20 which i
think is about perfect for me yeah oh my
gosh so pigmented very reminiscent of
like the NYX stay matte but not flat
powder foundation that I love but again
these were all good deals like I ended
up get
these blushes for like 13 or 14 dollars
I think maybe the cheaper might have
been like 11 or 12 again it was because
they already were cheap and then there
was a 30% off thing so definitely look
for coupon codes sign up for the email
because that's how I found out that
there was like a 30% off sale so I was
like on top of that let's be serious so
I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
