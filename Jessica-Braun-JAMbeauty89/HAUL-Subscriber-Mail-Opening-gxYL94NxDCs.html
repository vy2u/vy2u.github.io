unboxing video a friend of mine named
Alex and I will link her Instagram down
below she and I got to know each other
through Instagram which is how I get to
know a lot of people actually um and she
posts these awesome posts all about like
different like makeup reviews and
they're so great because they're really
short and sweet cuz it's just on
Instagram and so I love looking through
her page and I'm always excited when she
post new things so that's how we got to
know each other and she just sent me
this bag full of goodies and I'm so
excited to open them and see what she's
sent so I figured I'd share that with
you so um here's and oh my gosh okay I
already cut it open but I just now keep
inside and look look how cute
that's so cute I am so excited okay I
think I know that she said there's
something in here that she wants me okay
she there is one thing I know she wanted
me to open last so let's see so we'll
start with this little guy and she's got
notes on all these she said you can use
this over nail polish or alone this is
so cute oh my gosh
okay this reminds me of a birthday cake
in the best way this is an Ulta brand
nail polish which I don't know that I've
ever tried any of their so that I'm
excited and frankly look at this can you
guys see how pretty it's like every
color of the rainbow I don't think I
have a nail polish like this at all
yes that makes me want to do like an
accent nail right now okay okay let's
see this says these are so cute I
figured you could use these with your
cream eyeshadow
ooh that's a good okay I never thought
it there little tiny oops I gotta get
all the packaging through these little
tiny like sponge applicators but first
of all look at all the cute colors but
also I have never thought no this seems
kind of crazy now that I think about it
I've never thought to do cream eyeshadow
with this I always use a brush or my
finger but this would make it a little
bit more precise so now I'm excited to
dive in with these little suckers and
they are so cute oh my gosh okay this
one says you can never have too much
mascara which is very true yes okay this
is perfect cause I want to try this
actually now that I think about it I
think amber also sent me one of these
but it was a while ago and I hadn't
tried it yet so but now I really do need
to try it and now I'm praying that I
love it because then I would have a
backup so that would be fantastic so
maybe that should be the next mascara I
try I think I'm gonna try this next and
I love that little brush I'm so
intrigued by it you know yes we'll see
okay
okay this one says I love this primer
I'm excited I love primers oh my gosh
okay this is exciting
it's the benefit besties little thing
and it says it's got some kind of
gorgeous medium and then it has that gal
brightening face primer I've never tried
that primer I I'm like peeking in yes oh
my gosh yes I am so excited to try this
I think I might swatch this right now no
it's not open yet I don't open well I
don't care I want to know I'm gonna use
it tomorrow Who am I kidding by the way
if you're not following me on instagram
you should because I post every other
day typically ooh it's kind of like a it
feels different than the primer I
usually use which is maybe a good thing
it's not very drying it kind of feels it
kind of comes out like a pinkish nude
color and then it just
kind of obviously it buffs away but it
just feels nice crap I don't want to use
too much of it stop stop swatching I am
so excited tries I've never tried it so
I'm really looking forward robot okay
this is so awesome this one says this
smells so good all in caps can't even
wait this is perfect timing okay it is
the O red ruby antibacterial hand gel
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works first of all I
have never smelled the scent or even
heard of it so that makes me even more
excited and oh my gosh I don't even know
how to describe this oh my gosh it's
like cranberries it's like very okay I
got it
it's like cranberries that are covered
in sugar oh my gosh
Oh like with a hint of whimsy it's like
incredible I can't stop smelling it I
hope they still sell this scent because
like I'm about 200 and the little thing
is glittery anyway this is perfect on me
because I actually really do need a new
one in my purse so well that one's going
in there awesome this is so awesome
