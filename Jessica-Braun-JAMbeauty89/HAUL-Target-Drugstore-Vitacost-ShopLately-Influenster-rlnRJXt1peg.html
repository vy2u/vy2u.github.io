humongous haul for you guys and I'm
really excited because I've been like
holding off on using some I mean I still
use some of the products that I bought
especially bit something like I'm crazy
excited about or really need but like a
lot of this I'm like I'll use it then
put it back and it's like corner of my
room cuz I'm like I don't wanna forget
to mention it and so I'm so excited
filmless so I can just frickin dig into
this stuff what a weird world that
YouTube Beauty people live in it really
is bizarre if you really think about it
and sometimes that makes me laugh but
I'm like but alas I do it anyway anyway
so okay so I have stuff from Vitacost
which is this website that if you've
never heard of I will tell you about and
shop lately and Influenster and Target
and Meyer which is basically its
drugstore stuff that I got from Meyer
and I think that's it we're about to
find out because boy I have a lot of
stuff to share with you guys I'm so
excited so many like new goodies too
okay so we'll start with Vitacost
because this is something that i used to
see people do halls for Vitacost and
like and i would always just never watch
it someone who cares but recently I was
wanting to buy some more argan oil and
I'd mentioned to you guys that I love
the josie maran argan oil and I was like
geez but it's so expensive and I just
have this little one and when it runs
out I don't want to have to pay for the
full price one in LA and you guys are
all like um it's just argan oil go get
another brand you idiot and I'm like oh
yeah so I my friend ally had sent me a
link to like a referral link and it was
like ten dollars off I was like yup so
vitacost is basically like organic
really natural things it's there's food
on there there's skincare ingredients
Beauty priming you know kind of
everything you could ever want so and I
kind of got a lot of fun stuff so I did
get some argan oil this is the glow
Naturals brand and this is like a
jillion ounces I really can't find how
many ounces it is but it's way more than
my little josie maran one and it's way
cheaper i think this was like twelve
dollars might have even been less and
it's just a hundred percent organic
argan oil so I was really really
excited about that then I also was
wanting to buy some coconut oil that way
I could use it not only for cooking a
little less for that although I have
tried this made I made popcorn with that
it was so delicious and it smells like
coconut but I wanted one that was under
find that was come as natural as it
could be for other uses which if you're
interested in a video on that I could
make one I mean most of the things that
I've learned I've learned from Pinterest
and the web the web the interweb and
here on YouTube so it kind of be a
regurgitation but I wouldn't mind doing
it anyway so this is the dr. Bronner's
magic all one coconut oil and it's
unrefined it's the whole kernel and it
smells amazing
like I said it made really good popcorn
but I'm excited to use it for other
things so and then the last thing I got
from Vitacost oh and this was I want to
say around $12 as well the last thing I
got was something that Amory here her
name's Allison Anderson here on YouTube
recommended she just loves this it's the
Avalon organics vitamin C renewal cream
and it smells like oranges and this is
one that's a lot thicker so I want to
use this probably at night probably not
in the morning when I'm getting ready
I'll probably stick to my Clinique
moisturizing gel stuff but this it
smells so amazing it's a really really
thick formula which again like I said
it's gonna be so nice and I especially
this time of year it's still snowing
here you guys I'm sure anyone that lives
farther north than me it's even worse so
anyway so I'm really excited about this
and it was a way better deal in there
especially with the $10 off I'm like
yeah I'm just gonna buy it cuz I think
it's like $15 originally so I'm excited
about that so that was all provided cos
I can link that down below anyway so I
also got some stuff at a store near me
called Meyer look at that my favorite
store in the universe and I understand
we got a couple things I wanted their
new top coat and I was actually just
gonna go by such feet and I'd used it
you know years ago and I hadn't use it
because it gets so goopy so quickly and
then if I don't know it just it's great
but it's like only great for three weeks
and then it's a mess so I was looking at
it it was $10 and then I saw this out
the door and I remembered loving this
stuff too and it was only $5 so I ended
up going with this
and I've only used it once but I didn't
use it with the base coat so my nails
are already like chipping and I
literally painted these last night so I
don't think it's this I think it's the
fact that a my nails are a mess right
now B I didn't use a base coat which I
always do and this is cheaper nail
polish that tends to chip on me
regardless of how I apply it so I'm
gonna need to try this with some of my
other polishes that no are better
quality and see how I like it
but it really did dried quickly so out
the door I mean for real I could have
been out the door except for I was off
to lala land after I paid and of course
I don't know if you guys do this but
once my nails are even sort of wet and
I'm going to bed I like literally like
lay like this like my hands are up and
like my hands are like this while I'm
falling asleep or I'm like hey I sleep
in ridiculous way so that my nails don't
have like sheet marks on them I'm a
weirdo so another thing I thought at
mine was the batiste dry shampoo and I
was wanting to buy some dry shampoo and
I was looking at some of the other ones
dove has one and I almost bought it and
then I saw this on an end cap and I had
no idea they sold it and it was one that
came with like a free travel sized one
and this is in the floral and fruity
blush scent and I don't I don't know
I've heard good things about this but I
don't know how much of a white cast that
leaves and things like that so I'm
really excited to try it I know that
batiste makes one for darker hair too I
think so if I it does leave a white cast
I might try the darker haired one and
see how I like that one but they didn't
have it at Meijer when I was that's that
so shop lately you guys like my necklace
because it might be my favorite necklace
I've ever owned in my life let's look up
close ladies
it's got like these like lava rocks or
something that's like this charcoal I
don't even know and that everything else
is you know obviously gold toned I love
this I think it was $15 and I think it
was on a flash sale because they'll some
of their stuff will on flash sale but
it's always for sale
it's not like hautelook in that way but
I love it and most of their stuff isn't
$15 most of the stuff on there's like
five to eight dollars depending and I
loved it and I loved it for like over a
year now and I'm I think it really is my
favorite whoops okay I love it so much
if you haven't checked it out you got to
so this was sold by the seller on that
website I think it was amused me
boutique who I love I love their stuff
and then I also got these earrings for
like exactly three dollars and these
this is from the brand Daisy gem and
they all come in cute little packages
but these were just really really simple
rectangular little like cubic zirconia
studs and I just think these are so cute
I love the fact that they're little
rectangles and you know they're not
gonna last forever they were three
dollars but they actually look pretty
well made to be completely candid I
thought they'd be a little crappier and
I just think they're cute and I love
that there's gold in them because most
of my shiny little studs have silver
accents and so when I'm wearing it with
the gold necklace I just I just don't I
can't do it
so I was excited to have some studs that
are sparkly that have gold accents so I
love that and that was from Daisy gem so
those were the things I got from shop
lately I'll have that linked below I
love it and they have a really good
referral program to wear you know if you
join if you get even like one friend
join you get like $10 to spend on the
site and you can get as many friends as
you want I mean that adds up quickly and
their stuff is really inexpensive so
it's awesome and they have like crazy
chunky statement necklaces for like $7
it's awesome
awesome okay I still have a ton of
target set to get through but first
we'll do this influencer one get some
stuff out of the way here this was
something that I got I'd reviewed you
know that Rimmel scandaleyes retro glam
mascara that is my absolute favorite you
know you know the one well when I
influenced her it's really hard to
explain but basically you can join the
website you take surveys you get it
raises your score on there and then
you're more likely to have them send
samples and free Beauty things to your
house it's pretty freaking awesome but
um I reviewed one of the things they
sent me and then I earn the badge where
I got some more Rimmel products for free
so I was actually really excited about
this like stupid excited so this is the
Rimmel lash accelerator endless and I
guess it's kind of like a clump crusher
type thing it says it's clunk free
that's what the brush goes idli looks
like we'll see sometimes products like
this aren't as volumizing as I
personally like so we will see of course
I love the other Rimmel mascara so maybe
I'll love this one too I guess I've said
I was gonna say I guess we'll see I just
said that like 10
stop so I also got two of the they're
liquid liners one is their precision
micro eyeliner it's got a felt tip and
it's really precise obviously and it's
in black and they also sent the thick
and thin eyeliner where you can kind of
I think it's got a slanted yeah a
slanted tip or you can kind of do two
different thicknesses also felt-tip also
in black but they're both waterproof
24-hour love that love that so they also
sent what I was most excited about more
of the Rimmel's show off lip lacquers
and I was nervous because I own two of
them and I was like I hope they won't
send me the two that I already have and
then when I open it like oh no they did
and then I looked at the names like nope
they're actually a little bit different
so they sent BIGBANG which is this red
one in celestial which is the lighter
one okay oh my gosh the formula of these
are amazing because something that I'm
going to show you here in a second that
I got from Target I'm gonna compare to
these and I like these so much better
this is BIGBANG and that a celestial
such an everyday pretty color for that
one and this is oh my gosh how fun is
that
so really excite about these freaking
love the formula of these if you I don't
mean any more lip gloss or anything like
that it's not a really lip gloss though
if you don't ok here's what I'll say if
you don't like lipstick because it's
kind of like dry and weird you know and
you don't really like lip gloss get one
of these because there are some really
wearable everyday colors and then of
course there's some like Vava voom
colors but the formula is perfectly in
between a gloss and a lipstick I really
if you don't like either one but you
want something you probably love these I
was so impressed and they were not at
all what I expected when I bought them
and I love them though okay so the
humungous target haul let me wipe this
off because you know I'm about to make a
mess as usual so a few clothing items
real quickly they have their bathing
suit stuff out you just add wait till
it's on sale but I saw this top that I
was like I need it and you're gonna
laugh because it's so plain you'll be
like why did you need that so plain but
here's one thing you should know about
me with bathing suits I love the
mix-and-match thing I just love it and I
usually don't even get patterns I
usually just get playing colors and you
can bring like three different for
swimming to bottoms in three different
Thompson has like a million different
swimsuit combos I love it
my million I mean like nine right is
that right yeah
whoa anyway so this coral one is just so
bright and what I love about colors like
this is if you're really fair skin like
me it makes you look so much tanner when
you're out on the beach you don't look
like a dead body like walking around so
it's awesome it has just enough padding
that it's a little more comfortable for
me than having no padding at all and
then there's some that have way too much
and you're like that's not even a
swimsuit so it's the perfect in-between
I love how it's gathered there and it's
got like the back that doesn't tie there
but it does around the neck perfect
perfect perfect and I have other bottoms
that I would love to mix and match
especially like I have these white
swimsuit onyx I think would look
gorgeous with this to ears think or even
like a pattern one oh my gosh oh I love
it
I can't wait till it's warm out I'm
staring out at the snow stable okay one
last clothing item then fall beauty and
a body care hair care etc so this was on
clearance and it's just like a dressy
top and here's what I love about it it's
Moroni and what I love about it is that
it has all these will sailboats on it
and they're all white except for little
splashes of lime-green sailboats it's
not not just cute and it's appropriate
for work and it's I would say 3/4
sleeves and it has a cute little button
and slit opening in the back but it
still is okay for work I think so I just
really like it was on clearance for 1250
I have another one of these with a
different pattern and I really really
like it so it's excited to see I just
think this pattern is so cute in this
color blue actually I think I think it
looks nice with darker hair I'm sure
look beautiful lighter there too anyway
okay so onto the goodies so this is the
lip product I was telling you guys about
so this is the NYX soft matte lip cream
and I finally found a target near me
that sells NYX which is very exciting
and it's in the shade Addis Ababa I
probably butchered that but this is
beautiful pink and I'm wearing it today
and I like it but it shocked me because
it was like way drier of a formula than
I had anticipated
but I mean it really almost is like a
lipstick if they they just sort of
liquefied it sort of it's real creamy
but the thing is I've been wearing it
now
for like 30 minutes and I've reapplied
it twice and look you guys do that where
it's like coming I don't know this might
be okay with the lighter colors but when
it's this stark of a color it's a pretty
big difference especially in person you
can see where it's already separating
I'm like no way dude and my lips are
like we're nicely moisturized they
weren't really dry or cracked or
anything like that I suppose I could try
it with a gloss on top but that kind of
defeats the purpose cuz I just want to
be able to wear this alone the other
thought is I could line my lips and fill
it in so it's less of a difference but
again that defeats the purpose because
this is a product I want to be able to
have to look really put together without
having to line my lips or without having
it throw on a gloss on top etc so a
little bit disappointed I'm gonna try it
some more maybe I'll try like okay I
don't think I'm going to but it's just
interesting I don't know let me know
what your experience with these have
been as well as your experience with the
other NYX they have like the extreme lip
cream in all those and I haven't tried
any of those so I'm curious about the
other ones too so let me know if you
have any favorites that I can check out
cuz I do want to I want to try some are
and I love knit mess okay
so I also bought another one of my
beloved gos and sweet mint now I tried a
few of the other iOS balms I just really
haven't liked of some of them just never
moisturize my lips and I used them down
until they were gone or they just felt
weird on my lips or they smelled funky
ER I don't know this is the only one I
can't stop buying it it's so good and
it's so easy just slap it all over your
lips can't go wrong and I use it at
night I use it in the morning I mean
it's I use it throughout the day which
is why about another so I can keep one
of my purse and one in my makeup
collection this is my favorite lip balm
I've ever owned
ever in time ever I cannot
it's like $2.99 come on yes Sweetman
okay
oh yeah so I also bought a new
shampooing conditioner I was in need of
some and I almost bought the John Frieda
brilliant brunette one because I love it
and it really I
color my hair at all I never have and I
don't know if I ever will I guess we'll
see but it just really brings out the
natural low lights and highlights in my
hair and I love that stuff and so I
almost bought it and I had a coupon and
then I was like hmm I should branch out
try something else so I ended up getting
the clear volumizing root boot shampoo
and conditioner and this smells amazing
it really does it smells like what you
want your hair to smell like you know
what I mean like when you walk by a boy
and it's just like you know anyway I am
really really excited these were five
dollars each and they each have 12 no of
course this the condition no the shampoo
is twelve point nine food ounces the
conditioner has fifteen point nine
although it does say 25% more free I may
be getting into that five bucks each and
they smell great we'll see if it's
actually volumizing we'll see we'll see
how I like it I hope you like it
I also bought one of my favorites and
when I do an empties video in the future
you'll see that I use this all the time
it's this the Gillette satin care with a
touch of Olay now I've usually get it's
the first time I've gotten this time I
usually get the same thing with Olay but
it's like the sensitive skin unscented
one and this one has sugar berry scent
and I can't smell it yet and I don't
necessarily want to spray it right now
but I'm excited to try this I think the
packaging is adorable if you can see it
it really is moisturizing I do notice
the difference between when I use this
and when I use other shaving creams I
notice the difference especially in the
summertime when you want your legs to
look nice feel nice I love this stuff
and it's like two dollars so I also got
this lotion this is the Target brand up
and up body lotion skin firming and this
is the one that's comparable to the
Nivea skin firming one and I love that
stuff and I usually don't get in the
winter I usually just get it what I'm
wearing shorts more often or bathing
suits I really do feel that I notice the
difference it could be a placebo effect
I don't know but I really feel like I
noticed a difference when I use that
skin firming lotion versus when I don't
but I've never tried to off-brand so I'm
curious to know how the target ran this
was five dollars the Nivea one was like
ten
so I hope this works cuz I'd much rather
pay five dollars for it
so we will see and then the last thing I
got from Target is this L'Oreal boost it
high lift creation
right and this was inspired by Mel
Melissa Raymond she's here it's like LM
PHS I think is how people say it or she
says it but anyway she loves this stuff
and so I was excited to try it it was
only a couple bucks and it's supposed to
you know give you some lift at your
roots and just be I thought I'd be more
like a dry shampoo I haven't tried it
yet but I think it's supposed to be more
like a hair spray where it'll but it'll
really hold at your roots and add that
volume so if you backcomb her he's a
tall which I don't but if you did this
would be a great way to hold it or even
just kind of just get in there and
spraying it and just doing that a little
bit we'll see I'll let you know because
I feel like most of us are always trying
to get more volume especially up there
if this works that'd be awesome but I'm
excited about the petites dry shampoo
too for the same reason so I'm excited
to kind of see how these work even in
conjunction with each other how that
will go so I think those are all of the
things let me know if there there's so
many new makeup items that I have my eye
on that I'm waiting to go on sale at
Meijer because everything's cheaper
there and their sales are amazing when
they have them so I'm kind of waiting
there's a lot of Maybelline products I
really want there's a lot of Lory yeah I
mean there's there's so many new things
out of the stores isn't it overwhelming
I just walked through the aisles I'm
like hold this but I can't I just can't
no I just can't but so I'm trying to
pare it down and really get like maybe
just three or four new items that I
really want to review for you guys that
I really want to love as well I don't
want to get stuff I don't like I'm tired
of doing that anyway so let me know if
you have tried any of these new products
that you're loving whether it's body
care hair care face makeup care skin
care what let me know below because I am
curious and I'm kind of on the hunt for
just new products to try as we slowly
turn into spring
slowly but surely anyway so I hope that
was helpful and I'll catch you guys very
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
