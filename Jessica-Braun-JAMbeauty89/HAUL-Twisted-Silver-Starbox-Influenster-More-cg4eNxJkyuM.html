kind of a sprinkling of things to show
you guys today I have a star look star
box to show you an influenster voxbox to
show you some peel box thing as
something that I received and then also
sorry my eye is like hurting today also
some things from twisted silver which is
the jewelry website that I'm really
excited and I'll start with that
actually so I recently was in contact
with them and they let me pick out three
different things on their website that I
really liked and I'm really excited
because they also gave me a coupon code
for you guys for 15% off which will be
down below but my favorite piece that
they sent that I picked out was their
karma necklace and it looks like this
you've seen it I've worn it I think in
two videos already like the day I got it
I was like oh my gosh I gotta wear like
I can't stop wearing this necklace and
it's two different strands but it's all
one piece and it's just got all these
like fun dainty things and then some
like just a little bit of edgy things so
I love that it's that perfect mixture of
those two totally different things and
it just looks so pretty on I think and
what's cool about their company is they
they'll reuse old metal they'll you know
the metal is intentionally antiques I
mean it's just really cool and they like
to use mixed metal as well so another
necklace I picked out which is a great
example of that is this was it called
their compass necklace and it's a really
long one and it's got these really cool
little like this little ball that's blue
and then it's got these extra little
things and what's cool about their
products a lot of them you can double up
and make it a smaller necklace or you
can even like triple or quadruple it and
make it a bracelet and that's kind of
what they're known for
I just love their pieces and then the
last piece I picked out was their
beatnik bracelet which is this really
chunky silver one with this gold dangle
this is twisted silver and it's super
adjustable so if you have a small wrist
and you're used to bracelets not fitting
you this one actually would so I I
really like this I'm excited to wear
these more and more but the info the
link for their websites down below and
for the 15% off I think the promo code
is jmj my initials so Deborah
check that out I have been loving these
and they seem really high-quality too so
it's a win-win situation
so I also went to my peel box and this
company called fancy goddess and their
websites fancy goddess calm again
they'll be a link below sent me all
these earrings so they sent me five one
two three four five different pair of
earrings look at these aren't they
funkalicious they remind me of the
Titanic heart of the ocean like the blue
but I just think these are so crazy and
so fun and then another parent really
liked where this was this green pear I
just think they're so cool and different
they also sent this blue and red pear
you can see it and then this gold pair
of like little like hoops and then these
are so cool I'll just hold up one of
them it's like a little cluster at the
top where it actually goes in your ear
and then these little butterflies isn't
that adorable I just thought those were
so different so thank you so much for
that because that was unexpected and
really exciting I'm excited you'll see
these earrings make appearances and
videos I am sure so onto the influenster
voxbox influence there's a website you
can sign up anyone can sign up and you
basically review different products not
just makeup but it's household items I
mean all kinds of different things
companies you can review and the more
things you review the more the higher
your score gets your influencer score
and basically eventually you'll get free
boxes of things I get a free box like
maybe once every three or four months
and this one's a you know the Uni box
was basically College University College
typed type items and usually they're new
items that they're trying to get you
know the word out about them first thing
I saw when I opened it was tampons yeh
plate export I mean yanita it's nice to
not have to pay for them this month I
also got a pen it's the Accra Bal pilot
pen so yah who could always use a new
pen here in my eyelash another thing
they sent were these impress nails and
the pattern or the whatever you call
yeah I guess pattern on the nails it's
really pretty I don't I don't
typically we're nails like this but I
figure I might as well give him give him
a try I'm hoping they don't like hurt to
take off you know because that's another
thing they sent was this real tea brewed
tea like liquid and it's in the flavor
blackcurrant raspberry it's kind you
just court in your water and go so that
might be nice especially as we're going
into nicer weather that'll be really
really nice they also sent a lipstick
this is the NYC expert last lip color
and it's in the shade 447 forever
fuchsia and it just looks like this
really pretty fuchsia color I'm excited
to give that a try the last thing in
this box is the Rimmel stay matte liquid
mousse foundation which I have reviewed
here but I had it in a different shade
this is in the shade 0:10 light
porcelain which is I think their
lightest shade and it is lighter than
the one I have so I'm actually getting
rid of the one I had and gonna keep this
one so that's what it looks like you
guys probably know if you would like a
review I have reviewed this before so
just look on my playlist under reviews
you'll find it there so the last thing I
wanted to share with you guys is the
star box from ice actually from March
sorry but it's Ashley Hackman who is
here on YouTube I'd never heard of her
but she there's a picture that came with
it she looks she's beautiful so really
cool she's um it has her own little box
here and it came with only three
products which is less than normal
except for these would be most useful
this is the most useful group of
products that I've received from them so
the first thing is this lip liner and
it's in the shade what was it called
cherry cedar and it's just this really
kind of deep burgundy color and I don't
have one like this so I'm excited to
give this a try here she is by the way
in she party she looks so cute it also
came with a star looks infinity eyeliner
and it's in black and this was exciting
to me and first of all all the packaging
has like her little signature and things
on it is that not adorable anyway it's a
black cream liner really excited to give
it a try because I used the this type of
liner every single day and the last
thing it came with was a lipstick the
star Lux lipstick and it's in the shade
kinky and again the package
has her little signature on it I just
think that's so cute
and then it's this like firecracker red
oh yeah look at that a really nice
orangish red and it feels really
moisturizing and it doesn't really have
a smell let me double-check
yeah there's literally no smell to this
at all so that was one of my favorite
star boxes I've gotten a link for that
if you're interested is below and all
the info of how much it costs each month
but it is a subscription service I know
a lot of people have asked so yes you
got shitty ash anyway so I hope that was
helpful for you guys to watch and
informative about these different I know
that was kind of a random grouping of
different things but hey I think you
guys can handle it can't you anyway I'll
catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
