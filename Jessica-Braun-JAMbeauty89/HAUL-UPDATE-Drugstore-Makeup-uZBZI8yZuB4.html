a hall update for you so this was a hall
I did back in early September and it was
all a drugstore haul and I did it live
so what that means is and I do these
from time to time is that I took you
around I was just on my phone vlogging
and I took you around through the aisles
this time it was that target and I
showed what I was getting I even showed
some products that I had tried before in
the past that I just felt like
mentioning and showing you guys as
possible recommendations or even
products that I didn't like so if you
want to see the original haul I will
link that below this is a style of video
where I get to finally tell you really
my thoughts on these products that I
bought over a month ago I've been trying
for 5 to 6 weeks so I feel like I've got
a decent idea of how they work if I
would recommend them if not things like
that so if you like this style of video
definitely give it a thumbs up and I
hope you'll subscribe let's go ahead and
get into it alright let's start with
something that I ended up hating hating
so much it was the pixi nourishing
cleansing balm I was hoping this would
be like the pixie double cleanse that
they sell where it's it's the same shape
but it's split in half half of it is a
cleansing balm to take off makeup and
the other half is a cleanser for your
face and I loved that cleansing balm so
much I'd hope they made a whole thing of
it well I thought this might be similar
No first of all it has this horrible
smell it smells like soap but like gosh
what is it sweet almond oil and cocoa
butter seed to me it doesn't smell
anything like either one of those things
because I like both of those things
anyway it just I don't like the smell I
had been hoping this would be the kind
that you put all over and it kind of
melts your make a boy and then you rinse
it with water so you can go straight in
with a cleanser that's how I roll like
that is what I'm used to my skin reacts
well to that so I'm like don't fix it if
it's not broken well this is the kind
that you have to wipe away and I don't
have a problem with the kind that you
know you you get it in your hand you put
it all over your face
it melts your makeup away the same but
if you were to mix it with water because
say the first time you tried it you
didn't know you could not get it off
like it's like comical so it took me I
finally got all of it off
and then I read it realize oh you're
supposed to wipe it away with a damp
cloth you idiot Jessica now I just don't
I don't like wiping my face any more
than I have to
it's the reason I don't use makeup wipes
for my face it's the same reason I don't
want to use this with a damp cloth
because I don't want to pull on my skin
more than I need to I'm going on 30 here
in a year and a half fish not even oh my
gosh but I don't does that make sense so
if you're into that kind of cleansing
then you might like this because it it
definitely removed the makeup but for me
it's just not my cup of tea and the
smell really got to me too so I just I
used it like twice and I was like I'm
done I can't do it so I'm gonna pass
this on to a sister that might like it
alright next thing that I really did
like was the Revlon youth effects fill
and blur primer it says for face and
neck which I thought was interesting but
basically as this really cool like
packaging for a primer and you press the
bottom and it pushes up through the top
the formula of this reminds me a lot of
the new Too Faced peach blur not peach
book the new Too Faced peach primer has
the same color a similar consistency the
only thing is this kind of pilled up
really like weirdly and so I did have to
leave time like once I got it blended
into my skin I did have to give it like
a minute for it to like stay in place
before I put foundation or anything on
top of it so if you're ever in a rush
like I could never reach for this when I
was in a rush so I did think that was a
little odd and it made me kind of take
pause so while I liked it and I do feel
like it held on to the foundation really
well it's certainly not my favorite
primer from the drugstore
I would prefer the NYX hide your touch
or the Maybelline master prime blur and
illuminate I think these are both really
good primers whereas this was good but
it did have those few drawbacks so it
made me think
is it worth like $10 or maybe not next
up was this product that became
my favorite I don't remember if when I
did this hall if I already knew I loved
it and I was just buying it again that
could be but I love this mascara I won't
talk it to death today but it's the
l'oreal voluminous lash
best mascara I've ever used I've been
out of it and I need to buy another one
because I swear to you it dries out in
one month you have to buy it every
single month but it is so amazing from
the moment you open it that I'm like I
don't care I'm willing to pay you know
finding this on sale like what I should
do is the next time it's on sale buy
like three or four because I it is
incomparable to meet other stuff I know
a lot eaters have asked do I use the
waterproof I do not use the waterproof I
just use the regular and I love it so so
much oh my gosh I had I bought quite a
few concealers this trip one that I love
out of all of these it's my favorite is
it's really messy already but it's a
Revlon youth effects fill and blur
concealer I've used this so much so it's
from that same line and you push the
bottom up and it comes up into the
sponge and it is just the creamiest
prettiest concealer I've used in a very
long time especially from the drugstore
it's got a thinner consistency and yet
it's really creamy I have it in the
shade fair and it just blends in so
quickly and it looks so pretty and
brightening I do think this is geared
towards older skin with the idea of
youth effects because I feel like it
doesn't sink in the fine lines too much
it does think in a little bit like every
concealer does but I feel like it does
kind of bring this youthful glow to that
area I don't know that it has like the
highest coverage in the world when it
comes to dark circles but it does kind
of brighten and I really like that so
I've enjoyed using this clearly it is a
mess because I've used it a lot so I do
recommend this one a concealer I felt
kind of meant about was the pixie pat
away concealing base I have it in the
shade cream it's very reminiscent of the
Tarte shape tape a really large doe doe
foot applicator this is a lot thinner
than the Tarte shaped tape I don't think
this is bad by any means but it's
definitely not the same as the tar
I actually am wearing the tarte one
today and it's that's not my favorite
concealer either I know a lot of people
love it it really isn't I think honestly
that I'd prefer the Revlon went over the
Tarte one but regardless it was still a
nice concealer it's just really thin and
I didn't feel like it did a ton of
brightening nor did it really cover so
it was just kind of like okay that makes
sense so I feel like because pixie is a
little bit pricey in the drugstore that
it might not be worth your money you'd
be better off buying one like the Revlon
one or something else but it's just okay
I don't know it's just okay if I ran out
would I buy it again no this was a weird
one I did a whole video on this one this
is the Maybelline master camo and it's
the apricot corrector so you twist up
the bottom and it has this kind of
interesting top and what you do and what
I did in the video if you want to see me
demoing it I'll link the video but it's
meant to conceal purple dark circles on
your under eye so I would just apply it
in my darkest spots let it dry you know
kind of blend it in but not blend it in
so much that you can't see it anymore
then I would take a really good high
coverage concealer and put it on top of
it and blend that in and it was so
beautiful I think a lot more flawless
than if I didn't use this the reality is
there are products out there that kind
of do both and I end up leaning towards
those because this is a two-step process
you can't only use this unless you're
much much darker skin tone so like the
Bobbi Brown corrector and light bisque
is a very salmony concealer and it does
both it cancels out the dark circles and
conceal so you don't have to do two
steps and I feel like if you're older if
you have fine lines wrinkles things like
that or just general crepeiness under
your under eye you don't the less the
less layers the better because the more
you put in that area the more you know
maybe crepey it's gonna look the more
cakey and just you're just gonna look
older so I appreciate products where
it's kind of a two-in-one
so with that in mind I also picked up
the NYX dark circle corrector because I
thought oh it'll be like that Bobbi
Brown one I got in the shade fair know
this stuff it's seemingly pretty good
except for it's really like I don't know
like you can get it on your finger not
go it's creamy well once you start
blending it on it's just not nearly as
creamy as I'd wanted it to be and I was
really spoiled with this Bobby Brown one
but also this pixie one in the shade
brightening peach this one is very very
creamy and even more high coverage and
so I think if you're trying to get one
at the drugstore I would go for the
pixie one over the NYX one even though
the next one is a little bit cheaper but
I just I was underwhelmed it made my
under eye look really dry really old
like way older than I was and I was like
that's not the look I'm going for so for
that reason I can't put my stamp of
approval on it the next product I bought
was from soap &amp;amp; Glory which is newly
being sold at Target and it's their
Hocus focus instant visual floss
softening illuminator I saw that name
and I was like what no hocus-pocus so
the way I've been using this it says use
hope his focus alone as a cheekbone
highlight or blend it into your
foundation
I've even worn this all over just like
almost as a primer not because I thought
it would hold on to foundation but
because I thought it would add a nice
glow to my skin underneath like a matte
foundation it's a very subtle if you do
it as a highlight it's very subtle this
is more like a glow lotion in my opinion
it's not necessarily a liquid
highlighter so if you're buying it
because you want a liquid highlight
that's like really obvious like a Becca
shimmering skin Perfector this is not
what you want you want it to be more
like Mac strobe cream or just any kind
of a glow lotion I think you would
really really like it I think the
packaging is cool goes up to a squeezy -
there's plenty of product in there for
what you're gonna use it for and the
only thing I haven't done I haven't
tried mixing it with foundation but I
really do like the way it looks
underneath foundation so I would have to
assume mixing it to be nice however it
is gonna make it a little bit more
liquidy because this is a very liquid
product it's not like a thick cream or
anything like that so I like it
are there a million products like this
out there yes ELF makes a glow lotion
that's really good as well that's
probably cheaper but it still was really
really nice
and it's not that much more expensive so
the next product was a shampoo and
conditioner that I bought I'm about
halfway done with it if you can't see it
smell its the Herbal Essences volume
Arabica coffee fruit shampoo and then
the conditioner I bought it because of
the smell purely because of the smell
this might be the best smelling shampoo
and conditioner I've ever smelled in my
entire life however it completely dries
my hair out completely I mean like to
the point where my hair like feels like
ratty right after I've washed and
conditioned it it feels like gross and
dry and ready I don't know it's one of
those things that I have been testing
out shampoo and conditioner for a long
time and I haven't felt this way about a
shampoo and conditioner in years
so very very drying a lot of the OGX
brand shampoos and conditioners do the
same thing where they smell amazing but
they completely dry my hair out so
something to keep in mind if you've
found a really good shampoo and
conditioner that's that smells amazing
and it's really good for your hair
please let me know because I'm on the
hunt to find the perfect thing I've
tried the way stuff and I thought it was
nice my hair definitely liked it but I
didn't really I know a lot of you guys
like the smell I didn't really like to
smell it much umm anyway if you've never
smelled these though go to a store and
smell it because it's just like oh my
gosh and so every time I'm washing my
hair I love it but then the aftermath is
like the HAI it's not really worth the
amazing smell because it does not look
cute so you win some you lose some
so that was my update the only thing
that I didn't have that I actually
hauled in that video as far as I
remember was the Revlon youth effects
like foundation or BB cream whatever it
was
I assured I got was not the right shade
and so when I went back to return it
there was like no other shade that made
any sense for me so I was like you know
what let's just chalk this up at a loss
because I don't want to buy too and mix
them because I kind of tried it i
swatched it I tried a little bit on my
face and I just the the formula was
definitely had some decent coverage is
what I remembered but it just wasn't my
cup of tea I felt like it was a little
bit too much for my skin
I wish I could say more about it but I
really couldn't try it much more and I
plan to buy another
and then you know I didn't want to waste
the money if it wasn't a shame that I
was even gonna be able to wear so that's
my two cents on that so if you have
tried the rep on youth effects
foundation stuff definitely let us know
below in case someone else is interested
in trying it and maybe they're curious
about how it works beyond what I
remember other than that I hope you
enjoyed and that you'll give it a thumbs
up and I hope you'll subscribe as well
and I'll see you guys in my next video
