haul update drugstore haul I was going
to say that now I don't know it's not
direct service I'm like yes it a
drugstore haul update I've never done a
haul update video and so many you guys
are like hey Jessica how about you kind
of come through for us and actually tell
us how you like these things after you
try it for a while like that's a great
idea
so that's what I'm going to do so if
this was a big haul I will link the haul
it was about a month ago and I actually
did get ready with me that these
products but pretty much all of them I'd
never tried before there were a couple I
had tried that week before I filmed to
get ready with me but now I really know
how I feel about them so let's go and
get into it I'm gonna have to go like
Mach speed because this was a long one
alright so I had a couple of primers
that I bought for them
the NYX hydro touch I use today I love
this if you have dry skin I have just
fallen in love with it and it's very
similar to like the elf hydrating one is
pretty good but I think the next one is
even better the okay here's what it
reminds me of the smashbox hydrating one
this is probably about half the price if
not more than half and it's the exact
same thing i cannot stress that enough
I'm working on a deuced video and this
is going to be in it the next one is I
think even better it's amazing so
definitely recommend it
the next angel veil it's a cult classic
for a reason as I tried it reminds me of
my hourglass one it really kind of
smooths the skin it fills in every pore
you have feels like a baby's bottom and
it's got that kind of silicone feel kind
of freaks me out a little bit but it's
good because foundation just soaks right
into it and stays now if you have dry
skin I still think this looks okay but I
love this next one I think if I were
comparing these two NYX one I like this
one more again that's more to do with my
skin type than anything but they're both
really really good this one's a little
bit more mattifying obviously this one's
hydrating okay the next one I got I just
don't like it's that NYX honey do me up
it's a very goopy thick kind of serum II
primer it says it's a natural antiseptic
it's supposed to have smoother skin
because there's collagen and I was told
you get my
I don't like this as a primer but I also
don't want to put on like a skincare I
just don't like it so there's no place
for this I feel like in my collection
because I don't want to use it as skin
care to my skin didn't like it and it
doesn't look great under foundation so I
would say avoid kind of one of those
days that I let my hair air dry and it
looks like crazy so I'll just put it up
and now I feel like it's still somehow
it looks crazy
the next product I bought was for this
haul was the number seven state perfect
if you've been watching my channel for
the past month I can't stop talking
about this it's my favorite foundation
like ever this any elf wall is finished
are like neck and neck now they were
nice enough so I had bought the shade
calico and I bought another shade and
neither one of them was right for me so
they ended up seeing I guess one of my
videos and they send me three more
shades to try okay let me tell you why I
love it before I show you all these
shade so well the packaging is great
it's got a pump it's what is it like 15
dollars which it's higher than some
drugstore foundations but frankly a lot
of the drugstore foundations cost that
much and this is leaps and bounds above
it better than anything high-end I've
tried Bobby Brown NARS Dior like the
best now I do think this might be a dupe
for the the Lancome land so that we're
the Lancome 10th idole ultra where I
swear these are dupes I'm working out to
see like it are they really juiced by
side by side but I am pretty darn sure
you can save your money because this
stuff is ridiculous so it covers it says
medium coverage I build it up it looks
like full coverage every time I've run
this on my face I'll look in the mirror
at the end of the work day and think how
does my face to look that good like I
just can't believe it so I have the
shade calico is the lightest shade I
think and then I thought warm ivory
because I am warm I read another range
of bears they're listed luminate which I
open well but I've been mixing them cuz
neither want to write but they also sent
me
cool vanilla cool ivory and cool honey I
think cool honey was already too dark
for me I'm kind of torn between these
two so I'll have to let you know but I
just got this in the mail
from them and I was like sushi that is
so sweet and I will move so much very
excited the other one I bought for this
haul was the number 7 airbrush away I
know that like Topsy loves this I was
just watching an old favorites of hers
from like a month or two ago it's a very
liquidy foundation it has amazing
coverage it reminds me of my glossy a
perfecting skin tint this stuff is the
best not super high coverage but just
really good at me I'm wearing it today
it makes your skin just look so healthy
this reminds me that I think this has
more coverage than that one does and I
like it for that reason I actually will
apply this with a beauty sponge only
because when I do it with a brush I feel
like it's just rushing back and forth
and it's not actually blending in the
downside of using a beauty sponge is it
soaks a lot of the products up naturally
because it is a thinner formula so it's
kind of a you know yes it's wasteful but
I do think it looks better on my skin
but it just depends but I do like it I
think for me out of these two I like
this paper it's better but they're both
really good one product I just didn't
like was the Physicians Formula lash
contortionists mascara I'd let it dry a
little bit out and it looks a little bit
better but I just don't like the brush
you end up getting too much product in
some areas and not enough in others
because of the way it's kind of twirled
on there and so for that reason I think
it's not like the worst master in the
world it's not it's okay and I tried it
in that video and it was alright but
it's just not my favorite there are
others for cheaper like I like the
covergirl supersizers really good too
L'Oreal voluminous is really good so I
was like it's one that I'm not I would
never repurchase okay so I've had a
couple of favorites pop out from this
drugstore haul like lifetime favorites
this is the number seven number seven
bronzer quite a nice doing that twice
bronzer in golden sand this is the most
perfect shade for my skin now formula
wise do I think this is like the most
groundbreaking formula no it's just the
powder bronzer but there's something
about this shade if you're around my
tone that you will love now they do have
a darker shade they'd sent this in my
last PR haul this one's in caramel so
when you compare the two caramels a lot
darker but they're just really
the packaging is really nice and I feel
like finding decent bronzers in the
drugstore you can find some like one
well has some okay ones and but I feel
like out of the other brands there's not
like a huge selection of great bronzers
so these really stood out to me as just
really good products so I was very
excited to discover this and I've used
it like every day I use it today another
favorite that jumped out is this pixie
and Aspen Oh hard
glowy powder in London lustres they have
another one now that I want to try
that's a different shade but this one is
this gorgeous rediculous highlight I
mean it's ridiculous it is so it's so
pretty on the skin it's so crazy and yet
when you blend it into that area it just
looks so amazing so this is one of those
things that if I ran out or I lost it I
would absolutely go buy again I also
repurchase the NYX HD concealer in that
haul and it's just okay I don't think
it's bad but if there's nothing that's
really stand out about it it you know
has decent coverage it blends well with
a Beauty Blender or brush it's good it's
not one that I'm dying to use all the
time I don't see it think the want to
use that but it's still good so if
you're looking for one and maybe next
buy one half off or whatever it's a good
concealer it's just a standard decent
concealer that makes sense it's kind of
mint I guess is what I'm saying
didn't blow me out of the water but it
wasn't that another favorite the Milani
skate foot waterproof eyeliner I've used
this almost all the way up I need to
sharpen it see creamiest blackest
eyeliner you will ever use
absolutely waterproof you have to
sharpen it like every other use so
because it's so creamy that a lot goes
on so I'm flying through this but I love
the packaging it reminds me the Urban
Decay one and highly recommend if I run
out and I work through a lot of my other
eyeliners that I need to use up this
will be one of the first ones I would
repurchase it's so good I'll put this in
the waterline it looks really good as
long stays put that's our favorite
there were like so many favorites in
this video it's crazy but I'm getting to
some more that I really just ended up
not liking these are the infallible
paints or this is from L'Oreal and this
is
shade news star I also like the one
spicy blush I think it's called but I
think this one I love this one too
they're both really similar this one has
more of a pinky tone and it's just
beautiful the dough foot has kind of
like that chair so it has the product in
there it's the most comfortable color
lip gloss you could possibly try it is
so amazing I knew a couple shades it's
amazing it totally blew like other drugs
for lip gloss I think I like this one
even better than the Rimmel stay glossy
one sore now what do they call it on my
blog I love those but these have a
little bit more pigment because they are
like colored but these are more
comfortable I love these so highly
recommend if you see a shade you like
these are so comfortable so beautiful I
also got two of the Physicians Formula
butter blushes I like these however I
got the shade plum rose and I got the
shade natural glow they just don't pack
a huge punch so if you're wanting a
blush to really pack a punch the other
two shades that came out with I have to
actually scents bought one of them they
have way more pigmentation but these
first two natural glow and plum rose
really don't have a huge punch I don't
mind that like plum rose I've been using
a lot because for me and my light skin I
think it looks really nice for work but
it's not like BAM so if that's what
you're looking for avoid these two
shades you get the other two shades but
formula wise they're still really
buttery
they smell like coconuts the packaging
is really cute kind of depends on what
you're looking for one products that I
didn't end up loving was the NYX epic
black mousse liner it was okay it just
didn't it wasn't it creamy as I needed
it to be I love my my L'Oreal infallible
gel liner it's so so good I'm wearing
today I wear it literally every single
day and this just did not match up with
that I think this might be a little bit
cheaper maybe but it was not like this
is one that I'll probably declutter I
never reach for but the essence gel
eyeliner in Midnight in Paris is really
good but this one I swear is dried out
like I feel like you could just fall out
of here yeah it's it so I must have
gotten an old one because I tried this
before and it was really really good so
I don't know that there's any way you
could know
you know before you buy without opening
them but this one is I'm honestly
frogging throw away it's so dried-out
already which really stinks but it
typically is really really good so if
you're looking for a cheap one go for
the essence one one product that was
okay was the essence superfine liner
they really thin felt-tip I love felt it
pretty black it is really long so I have
to be careful with it and I'm so I'm
still getting used to it but it's really
really black and it does stay on all day
so I was impressed with the formula I
just got to get used to the really long
felt tip eyeliner part of it Wow and it
already dried and I can't wipe it off so
I need an actual makeup removing one
that is impressive
next product I got were the pixie extra
eye bright liners I got the extra one
and just the regular one these are
really good you put them in your lower
waterline to light in that area and
brighten it and I use these all the time
I've been comparing them to my Tarte
fake awake and they are just as good and
I'm pretty sure these are a little bit
cheaper than that but the extra ones
almost pinkish white and the regular eye
bright is more of like a peach so
they're both really good I like the
extra one just a little bit more because
it really packs the punch
without looking fake the next product I
fell in love with you guys know is the
Maybelline single shadow it's they're an
expert where shadow in nude glow it
looks like the l'oreal amber rush kind
of a shadow it's so beautiful so silky
it kicks up boots kicks up a little bit
of powder but not so much that it's
getting everywhere it's just so pretty
it stays in place I mean look at that
even from a distance I haven't tried
anything else in this range I'm thinking
about it now so if you have any
recommendations in great shades let me
know I also got the NYX jumbo eye pencil
in black bean I've used this I haven't
used it like all over my lid with the
shadow over it yet but I've used it to
kind of smudge on my lower lash line
from time to time very very black really
quickly smudges and then it doesn't move
all day and I appreciate that so if
you're looking for a liner maybe for
your lower lash line that you don't want
to move this is actually a good option
it's one that's overlooked because it's
not necessarily marketed as an eyeliner
but if you just put a little bit on and
get like a foam smudger or even like a
you could even use the
sponge applicator from like an eyeshadow
thing just to smudge it it will not
budge and so that is awesome you guys
know I like the one in milk used to be
really big on YouTube I still use it I
really love it that's a white one and I
use it like as an eye primer base
because it holds on the shadows really
well in the shadows really pop because
it's over more of a white base another
new favorite was the NYX no filter
powder I use this on my face today not
too much because I want to so be glowy
this is beautiful
it's very I mean pretty high coverage
it's definitely a powder foundation but
it looks really good on the skin it
doesn't illuminate my dry skin like I
kind of figured it would in a way it
reminds me of it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination powder
foundation that I love but it's really
expensive it reminds me of that it's not
quite as I was a illuminating but kind
of illuminating as that but it's really
nice next one you guys know if you saw
the video that I hated was the elf
foundation serum I tried it a couple
more times every single time ended up
wiping off my face because it just like
I was wanting it to be more like you
know the number 7 airbrush away or this
glossier one that I mentioned where it
makes your skin look healthy it just
didn't do that right skin now I know
when I host this a lot of you guys that
know that's my favorite it works it
looks great on me so it just must depend
on your skin type but for me I've got
dry skin and I feel like there are just
certain areas in my face that it just
collected there and it looked horrible
so maybe if you've got like a perfect
face or made some in for more mature
skin I don't know I just didn't like it
that last product was this Herbal
Essence dry shampoo I've used about half
of it it does smell good I've got kind
of tired of the scent to be quite candid
but it's ok it's just a standard dry
shampoo from the drugstore where it
soaks up some good but it certainly is
not the best I've ever tried so what I
repurchase again maybe but probably not
I'd rather use with the teach ones I
think those do a little bit better my
favorite is the living proof dry shampoo
because that one's expensive so I don't
buy that every single time but it's
still good and if you like this scent
then you'll love it cuz your hair will
smell like this definitely all day long
but it's alright it's okay
so I think hopefully that was everything
in
video hopefully this video was helpful

kind of video by giving this a thumbs up
