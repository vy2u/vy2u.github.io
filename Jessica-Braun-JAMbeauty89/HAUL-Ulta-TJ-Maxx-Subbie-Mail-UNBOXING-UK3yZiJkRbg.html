have a haul and I also have an unboxing
that a subscriber of mine and a friend
of mine said to me and I have well you
will see so okay I figure I'll start
with what I bought first one thing that
I bought that I picked up at Target I
think is this cute little Minnie Mouse
himself isn't that so cute was like
around three dollars and it smells like
strawberries and oh my gosh how cute is
this like seriously seriously this is
adorable okay another thing I got from
Burlington Coat Factory if you have one
year.you they have some awesome shoes if
you're looking for like running shoes or
workout shoes these are adidas and they
are absolutely so ridiculously cute and
they were a pretty good deal I think I
got them for like 40 and somewhere on my
Instagram and I posted these photos I
have the name of this specific shoe but
I can't remember it right now I think it
was called like the liquid three or
something like that liquid something but
anyway all my Instagram you can find out
another thing I got was this purse it's
a Steve Madden bag it is just so cute I
just I love that it's two different
colors two tones and it's got gold metal
accents and it's just big enough to hold
everything but it also has like the
longer handle I just love it and the
outside pocket is awesome and the inside
cute it's got like some I mean you can't
really see it but love this bag again
found it at Burlington Coat Factory for
a really really good deal so definitely
check them out it's very similar like TJ
Maxx or Marshalls they have all these
designer brands for pretty cheap so
another thing I got in this one I got
from TJ Maxx is from the brand Te'o
collie I don't know if you can read that
there because it's in white but it's
this of course it's like kind of falling
out but basically it's this um come on
this little sterling silver necklace
that has the letter J isn't that so cute
um very excited about that and I've been
wanting an initial necklace and it's a
lowercase J and everything is so cute
and it was only twenty dollars so it
wasn't too bad at all for something that
hopefully won't tarnish for a while so
that's pretty awesome so then I went to
Ulta oops
and so the lady working there she and I
were chatting and she gave me a 20% off
friends and family coupon and it
actually applies you know you get like
the 20% off coupons in the mail and
those only apply to like very specific
things like it doesn't really apply to
any of the higher end brands that they
carry so that totally sucks however this
one does apply to like everything in the
store and I kept asking I'm like
seriously everything she's like yes I
was like oh my gosh so I ended up buying
The Naked 2 palette which I'm so excited
about I have the original Naked palette
and I love it however I think the colors
in this one are going to be much more
kind of up my alley if you will and also
it has half baked in it just like the
original naked does and that's like my
favorite shadow ever smells like plus
I'll have more that so with 20% off I
ended up getting this for like what do I
get it for like 42 what would be 20 yeah
like 42 bucks then I got the Anastasia
anastagia however you want to say it
this Browse kit and I got the shade
medium brown for the actual like powder
it has two different shades and then it
comes with the number seven brush which
is dual ended and then it also comes
with a clear mascara so I'm very excited
about this I've been looking forward to
trying it and this was perfect oh my
gosh I'm just so excited to give this a
try so that is all that I have bought
recently that I've bought other odds and
ends like CVS I got for like $6.99 a
three pack of the cotton pads you know
let you can use for eye makeup remover
or nail polish remover it was a really
good deal so definitely check them out
it's like a big value pack and then I
feel like they've got something else
that I'm like forgetting but it's like
already put away but if I think of it
all here's so now on to what my friend
karen has sent me and she
he sent me this box and she said she
wanted to send me some things I was like
oh my gosh that'd be so awesome and then
I like I mean this is way bigger than
what I expected it was so sweet
so I've already untaped it but I haven't
done anything else I just want to be
like you know cutting and getting out
knives and cutting my finger off in
front of you all no okay
oh my gosh okay so it is okay so there's
a note which says private so not gonna
read it to you all okay
- so sweet Karen thank you that's so
sweet okay so first thing I notice are

sit three it's three little boxes these

many things you could do with these I
can hold my brushes in them I could hold
like lotions in them so oh my gosh

cotton rounds these are so cute they
have this little ribbon okay another
thing looks like this one like kind of
came unwrapped a little bit first of all
a favorite color ever oh okay she sent
me the sugar lemon fizz hand soap which
first of all I love the smell of lemons
there's nothing more like cleansing of a
smell

horrible just erase what I just said

gonna be so nice in my bathroom and then

never smelled this scent before ooh very
like definitely citrusy but in a good
way and it's like an energizing smell
