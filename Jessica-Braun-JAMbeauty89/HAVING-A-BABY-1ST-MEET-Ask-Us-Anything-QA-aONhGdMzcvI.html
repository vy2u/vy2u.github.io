you have a YouTube channel it's called
Tyler travels TV guess what we do on
there we travel with Tyler on TV you tip
onion I don't travel to was what I
should have called it with this new
background oh oh good call this is
Tyler's background but we just filmed a
video on this channel about try the
world which we used to do I'm trying to
sit in Ian's back here at the new
studios this is my studio just guys her
own suits on that so her down the street
it's wondering we put the camera so I'm
smart anyway we just film to try the
world video on machine oh where it's a
traveling food box but we you sit it on
mine but now we do it makes more sense
on your channel so if you're interested
in that we can link that up there or
down below or both um though that way
yeah honestly I'm so like ginger snaps
were part of it was a holiday box and I
can't stop you I've had like ten in like
five minutes
it hits up that's not no don't look at
how many you're less everything they
need a lot while you're out of the room
if you hear any by the way if you hear
any cries that's Pinocchio he's he's in
his cage chillin cuz he's been playing
with us and running around all day
but now I'm he's like supposed to be
relaxing getting he's like I can't relax
you think your ass in here but he's too
crazy he jumps on his thing he's so cute
but it doesn't work for videos well Sean
will show up at some point anyways so I
just asked on Instagram then I'm not
sure how soon don't get this up but just
tonight I asked him my Instagram I
posted a little photo of us and I asked
what questions you guys have for us
because we've never done a video since
we've been married
together yeah the last one was a year
ago oh my god oh my is the boyfriend tag
when you're so my boyfriend and some of
my students watched it and they were
like you saw that and Tyler you had like
a big thick beard because it was when
coming back
hey if I'm out there 12 hours a day
chopping trees down alright alright I
sit in a cubicle not the point
I need the beard for protection against
the elements that's right whatever you
say anyway um so we've got a lot of
questions here to answer and I'm so
excited so a lot of them are repeats so
some of them I might kind of paraphrase
because it was like 10 people to ask
around the same question so one big
question was how did he propose and you
know questions about the proposal about
the wedding you know what we would have
changed we've done quite a few videos we
have the actual video of him proposing
like the actual one we ask that I'll
link that below and above like I keep
saying it's in the cards if you know
what that is it's a little I above bub
also link it below it's like very
generic I hope we're dead on then be
cool anyway um like about to cry even
talking about it but um news that this
resort that was really really cool not
far from here called the West Baden
Springs Resort on has lots of history
and obviously you just did like a
documentary style video travel video
about it yeah we should link that below
- it's so awesome on my card be like I'm
proud of you for that video it was a lot
of work and it's it looks amazing it
looks really professional so that'll be
linked to but the original video is a
proposal we can link and the video you
did a really cool video of our wedding
so it's literally got like everything
it's got you know the ceremony and the
reception and it kind of stuff you did
it was a little baby I kind of a little
bit everything else that day yeah
and that getting ready and just
everything it was so I loved it so much
why the montages let a montage this is a
long day so I could eat 24 hours into 30
minutes is what we had to do so montages
but so if you're interested if you've
got questions about any of that stuff
watch those first and then if you still
have questions you can ask us below but
I think a lot of those questions are
answered in those videos so and we
really haven't talked about it much I
haven't talked about it one of my slick
since we've been married you and I I
really don't know that we have we've
just been so busy we do I mean like we
do our own separate yeah so anyway we
don't do
together often but here's one so alright
so another question that's more specific
mm-hmm a lot of people are asking about
having kids Carly are you want to answer
this one I think I mean I'm speaking for
myself assuming to both of us but I
think we will have kids I think as of
right now we've only been married six
months I think we want even that long
not even know I guess September October
2 at 5:00 okay married five months but I
think at this point we kind of want to
spend some time together yeah you know
maybe for a year or so and then and then
we can talk about having kids until I'm
in the middle of switching careers right
now so there's a lot on our plate right
now where we're kind of you know
figuring stuff out and but I think in a
year so well we'll pry start talking
about having kids 14 not too many boys
think it's working
love 26 will make me I wouldn't eat one
with a litter of you I'm one of six so
like I just feel like it's natural to
have a lot of kids in the family I was
talking to my dad the other day and he
said something like you know of course a
million people asked us about having
kids but she says what it is but it kind
of kind of kind of comes with it what it
kind of comes with the territory of
being married but he said something like
you know you know there are my parents
are in their 60s and he they were having
everyone over and he said you know if we
hadn't had kids when we did we would you
know we'd be at this point in our lives
with no one to invite over and no you
know other than maybe friends but no one
known by over and no grandkids running
around the house and you know and
they've got a ton of grandkids it's like
your grandfather who passed away a
couple years ago they had 12 kids 12
kids so within those 12 kids he's got
like literally hundreds of you some
grandchildren and then 30 40 some
great-grandchildren
nicely garlic and I love it because he
didn't know anybody's name and we happen
to be expected to like a guy hey guy are
you doing good to see you but I'm like
you I'm not you I am you might know I'm
a brawn but you don't know anything what
you guys ever Bharani looks rounds as
this is mine - two people made these for
under cool thing anyway yeah so we talk
about kids more than you would ever
think but we're just waiting a little
bit we write thoughtful people we don't
do anything instinct what we do we're
such an odd couple because we always do
things young double we are but we are
because we do things like impulsively
like you know we'll see set them off the
side okay let's go
weird rollercoaster off the side the
road let's go and well dig dirt sounds
awesome
let's do it but then while also we're
very thoughtful people and it's not
something that we take lightly we don't
want to just you know oh we really start
having kids you know we want to make
sure like almost like another nest egg
but kind of you know because right now
we live in an apartment and a lot of
people ask kind of to switch gears a lot
of people asked about what happened to
Simba if you watch me when I had the Pug
Simba he's still alive I lived with my
parents then and I thought I made that
clear in a couple videos that I guess I
didn't because I had it's kind of a long
story but my arc was when I graduated
high school I moved to Chicago for two
and a half years to go to school there
in Chicago for musical theater then I
hey well there's a lot of heartache and
a lot of other things that happen there
but I moved back home and went to school
here lived in my parents for a while
went to school for teaching then I moved
out for a couple years continued to go
to school for teaching then that my
senior year when I was student teaching
and you literally can't have another job
in your student teaching it's like your
job but you're not getting paid in fact
you're paying for it anyway so you do
the job of a teacher kind of but um you
know I think Bay so that year I live
with my parents and that's what I felt
that's kind of really about to start
might have been right before but I think
your you were you were I'm still
babysitting I was needing her family
okay you say you hadn't started student
teaching yet but it was a time period
yeah so I watched her very first video
we were watching it a couple weeks ago
we were like let's look at your very
first video and you were doing it on
your iPhone just like sitting on the
floor and you're like ah I was like but
I love her because she was so bullied
she just was like I'm gonna start doing
this and I was like alright hurry and
you just started doing it now you have
200,000 subscribers that's incredible
their iPhones with your iPhone sitting
next to your bed on the floor just
started talking about makeup and here
you are just a couple years later look
at you can'tyou amazing you got I need
like a little windshield wipers for my
eyes you make me cry incredible quite a
journey but it's been awesome so several
people have asked when you first saw
each other did you know he or she was
the one and the answer that is obviously
and I remember how we were rolling into
two rehearsals for Aladdin which is how
we met I played 11g play jasmine and I
was rolling in I thought I was all cool
when I have my baseball cap on sideways
but you know I'm like oh yeah you know
oh I played it I've done dinner theater
in Indianapolis so pretty much made it
as an actor you know pretty much the
greatest actor ever was
you know pretty cool and then this lady
walks and I go hey hi I'm Tyler nice to
meet you
that's such a nerd but she was so pretty
and I couldn't and then she started and
then she started singing and I was like
I'm gonna marry that lady I'm gonna
marry that lady and then I didn't going
back even further the very first time we
ever talked we there's this website
thing I don't know if it's still around
but it was for Indiana actors you know
to find jobs to find you know it's you
know if a cast was announced they would
announce although the whole castle it's
Indiana auditions that comp yeah Joel
urban man that dude was the man I love
sorry today he's not human the best he's
just the nicest guy but he said we did
this website I contacted you I don't
even remember what the forum was there's
like a message board you know yeah and I
contacted you and said hey hi my name is
Sylar huh I'm a teenager I think we
would be friends you were like 13 and I
was 17 keep in mind I'm about three
years all their names she knows nothing
too cool to be hanging out with and
that's like I'm yeah I was 17 I was like
you're so great I think we would be
great friends and then she's like um
thanks for the compliments but I'm Way
older than you I didn't I'm sure is like
thanks bye like I'm sure enjoy thanks
bye so we met a couple times between
that very briefly yeah very briefly like
seeing shows because when you're in
theater and in Indianapolis if there is
like I would know the guy I would know
the person sitting next to her but I
didn't know her yes brushing past each
other in weird ways so i nobody was i'm
assuming you knew who I was I don't know
but anyways so then finally we were both
cast and a Latin together and so I
remember standing on the stage and you
know I'm like talking to my one of my
best friend Sam and we're going through
lines and stuff whatever kind of joking
around and I see him come in super late
to the first rehearsal and I was like
boy he was so cute though yeah like his
baseball cap on and I was like shallow
jesse was like he's cute but then you
came out when I started talking to you
and we realized like we had a lot in
common other than just theater and then
I remember the first thing I ever said
to you though we were like just plopped
on stage starting blocking right away
and so we're reading our lines and
trying to move onstage and take notes
and once we had like a break for a few
minutes we were both standing on stage
together and I remember saying something
I eaten a yogurt that day and I said
which is ironic now because I'm like
but then I didn't know that I was so I
was eating a yogurt and I said to him
sorry I've got dairy breath do you
remember the worst and I was like yeah
I'm sure he liked little hearts flying
out of my eyes and ears dead dead dead
hearts okay no I did wait you did he did
who's dead we're done who's on first a
lot of people asking about our bucket
list like what are things we want to do
I know let's just pick one one maybe
like one place we want to travel to on
our bucket list oh my gosh this is hard
well you think all the same way mine is
going to Indonesia specifically Bali
because if you've read Eat Pray Love
which is a really famous book that's one
of the three places she goes to I figure
we'll go to Italy at some point what's
the other plant Indy up I hope so but
the one that I'm like I really really
want to go there it because it mixes
like pleasure and love with spirituality
and love so it's it's just a really cool
from when I heard of always incredible
yeah and I remember doing like a really
long in college a really long report and
I mean like 30 40 pages report about
Bali and like the geography it was a
geography class the geography and how
they I why do I have to write a report
that long to get an elementary education
degree I don't know but anyway it's good
murder I learned a lot about it I know a
ridiculous amount of us so I'm dying to
see the rice to the terrace rice paddies
in person and all that good stuff what
is on your bucket list my travel bucket
list it's ensure it's long it's a
million pages long but like what's I
guess Norway only because that's where
my family lineage is from is Norway
Ireland yeah yeah
and I mean I I hope that we get to go to
both and before we go like if we know
we're going to Norway next year you know
spend the time trying to track the
family line and same with your family to
go to Ireland so we can see the sights
where we came from because it's such an
amazing feeling even if it's you know
ten generations removed knowing this is
my family
families similar blowing up I actually
have a chest that's from my great-great
grandpa just great but he actually
brought it over from on the boat to the
United States from Norway his name was
Thor Thorson I still can't believe that
Thor we have an excuse the name our kid
Thor I want to name my child food it's
actually a family name it's not just
we're just being kind of you know play
like it's a real name
that's pretty but I guess it was a very
Norwegian thing like Thor Thor sand my
grandfather's name was Paul Paulie so
another question is what is something
both of you guys didn't expect from
YouTube expect to gain or lose I've
never been if you hear jingling we let
Pinocchio up he's on the phone
um I think one thing that maybe you guys
don't realize about YouTube is that it's
like it's nothing and what I mean is and
that sounds terrible I don't mean that
in a negative way but it's as if the
things you're putting out there it's
fake you can't touch it and so when you
send it out an answer site it's
intangible it's a great word when you
send it out into cyber land you know
people respond and you can comment back
and you but it still doesn't feel real
so like yes I've got two hundred
thousand something subscribers that's
amazing it makes me cheer up like it
makes me emotional but it's not
something I can feel so you know I what
that girl that recently put a thing on
YouTube putting social media and more
power to her just about the the facade
and what's behind it when it comes to
social media YouTube Instagram etc
honestly all that's true I mean that's
not we're not really a secret I hope
that doesn't feel like it's a secret I
kept from you guys because you guys I'm
telling you guys everything but I think
the reality is that it's all very fake
and I don't mean the people are fake
although maybe but what I mean is that
it just doesn't feel real so yes I've
got that many people watching my videos
but it doesn't
feel that way like I go to work every
single day I come home I've got my puppy
to deal with and then handsome husband
and you know family and friends but
nothing really changes it's just that I
also film videos and put them up it's
not like I'm you know for me maybe it's
just different because France we're not
going to like big events where people
would go see us or you know like I think
of youtubers i watch that they go to
these huge events and so to them they're
like wow it does feel like a weird level
of Fame but for me it doesn't at all do
you know what I'm saying like it's just
it's just another thing that I do during
the day like or throughout my week
really yeah I guess so what I did for me
what I didn't expect is that you know
when I started this I thought wow you
know I'll connect with a lot of people
but yes I've connected with people and I
made some I really have made some
friends here on YouTube but none that
are like people I'm hanging out with or
that I you know text or talk to
regularly so it's just I love it but
it's it's just different than you would
think so we're gonna cut it out there
because there are a million questions
we're gonna do part two of these
questions on his channel so we're just
gonna upload them hopefully on the same
day yeah so that should be uploaded as
well we will link that below so if
you're wanting to watch more because
there are a lot more yeah good questions
too yeah that's just what kills me we're
not gonna be journalists over here I
know that's so awesome
anyways so the other half will do on his
channel and be sure and subscribe when
you're over on my channel time to
travels TV subscribe I mean you guys
it's shameless I know some people like
oh my gosh I can't believe they asked me
to subscribe to this channel bye it's
like course I'm biased
it's my honey Mary anyways if you're not
interested in travel warm eithe and know
there would be no reason beautifu
but it'd be the same like if someone
sees me on your channel if they're not
interested in makeup then they wouldn't
subscribe me that's mine but in case you
are head on over to channel we'll link
that below as well and I hope you guys
enjoyed and I hope that you'll subscribe
and I'll catch you guys in my next video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
