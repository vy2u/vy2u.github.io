bringing you a new at the drugstore haul
I just recently a couple videos ago did
a drugstore haul of just products that I
had been wanting to buy it about on my
list but there most of them were
products that have been around for a
while that I just wanted to try so I can
leave that video below but everything
here I bought at a different time and
they're all brand new to the drugstore
every single product so let's go ahead
and get into it
so I'm actually wearing a lot of these
products today and I'm excited to tell
you kind of what is what here because
you guys know I love the German store
and so a lot of these I some of them I
had heard of others I hadn't so when I
was finding them in the store I was my
brain was just exploding I was
snapchatting like crazy and this was a
couple weeks ago actually so um the
first thing I found was his Maybelline
lip gloss palette and I have seen a
couple videos on this and I heard a lot
of great reviews so I was like okay I
definitely want to try this now I
haven't watched all of them I'm actually
probably today going to film a swatch
video of this we'll see if not today
then in the next few days I haven't been
super impressed with a couple i've
swatched and i heard really good things
about like these two colors here
but they were kind of I don't know if
it's because I have really pigmented
lips and that very well may be but I was
not impressed but like I said I don't
want to judge a book before I read it so
I'm gonna try out the other colors as
well but I think it's a really cool idea
and if you're just starting out or you
just want to have a lot of options
especially if you travel and bring all
of these but again I don't know I don't
want to say anything negative because I
really don't know this palette well but
I thought it was super interesting stay
tuned if you're interested more in this
palette so the next products that I'm
going to mention are really exciting to
me because I did not know these existed
when I saw them in the store I will put
prices below for all this because I
don't know all the prices off the top of
my head but they have Maybelline holiday
and the thing about holiday pallets is
in the drugstore I feel like it's even
since I was a kid the drugstore pallets
they had weren't like the name brands
they were like color club not color club
but they'd be you know some random color
brand and they would have you know these
huge piles and they were really not
always the best quality and they'd be
you know five dollars whatever but I
think for me this is the first time I've
ever seen holiday pallets in the
drugstore so they have two options they
have gilded in gold and they also have
up in smoke and these show fingerprints
like crazy so gilded in gold was the
first one I saw and I was like yeah I'm
gonna need that so in this palette it
has a blush and four shadows like a
little quad they've got like some you
know like a sponge tip applicator and a
little blush brush they have a black
eyeliner that's you know like a pencil
one they have a lip gloss and in this
case it's a red one that comes with this
and then these two guys go out and it
has like a little powder puff kind of
thing I mean I don't I haven't used it
probably won't
and then like a highlighter so this was
the gilded in gold one and then they
also had the up and smoked one which has
more smoky colors involved but they have
more of a pink blush whereas the other
one was more peachy this one's pink and
sparkly they have a pink lipgloss the
same eyeliner but then like I said more
smokey eye shadows and then it comes out
for a little puff and then the
highlighter so I'm going to do an
in-depth review with swatches etc of
both of these palettes if you're
wondering just to give you my two cents
right now while you're watching a swatch
really pretty some of them the bowl of
the blushes are really nice I'm wearing
the gilded and gold blush right now
which is that more peachy tone one it's
a very natural blush very natural but it
can look really pretty as well oh I
literally just got black on me from
probably that I show
oh it's getting worse what am i doing
there we go anyway I love the gilded in
gold shadows especially this light kind
of rosy champagne
is so so pretty it's right there this
one feels like an urban decay shadow but
then there's like the gold one that it's
still nice it's not terrible but it's a
lot more powdery so there's a little
more flakes below your um what's that
gonna fall out below your eyes which I
mean that stinks because the last thing
I want is a bunch of glitter right here
to accentuate any bags I might have you
know I'm actually currently wearing the
up in smokes one I'm wearing this white
shade that came in the palette all over
the place I kind of mixed in some from
the gilded gold or gild it in gold like
I really like I said that one shade I
really like I kind of mix it in as well
with a brush but for the most part it is
just that white one and then I just
pulled a matte nude shadow to go right
under my brow bone from another palette
then I think it was the Naked 2 basics
palette so anyway I'm still impressed
with these so I will do that in depth
review if it's already up I will link it
if not just stay tuned it'll be up this
week I am so excited about these I am
excited for you know if any other makeup
brands come out with these kinds of kits
they're awesome so moving along that was
like my main really exciting thing the
next really exciting thing I bought were
these new Revlon Ultra HD matte lip
colors I bought two shades I bought the
shade devotion and then I also bought
the shade addiction devotion is more of
a kind of peachy shade but does a little
more it's almost like coral peach and
then the one I'm wearing on my lips
today is this one which is the one
called addiction it's much more berry
toned
I like both of these I've worn them both
they have a really comfortable
consistency that it dries to a semi
matte I mean if you can see you can
still see a little bit of glisten to
them and that might be the lip balm
underneath but they are really really
pigmented I'll show you some swatches so
this is the one I'm wearing today right
there and then and they just have a
sponge tip applicator and then this
other one which is called devotion the
more peachy Coralie one is right here so
they pack a lot of color punch
they're really comfortable on the lips
honestly I was impressed and the
ultra-hd
lip colors they have that were like
lipstick form I hate it and if you
haven't seen that video I can link that
as well I did not like those at all so I
was prepared to not like these in the
least but I'm actually really impressed
and you guys know I've been on the hunt
for the best liquid matte ish lipsticks
and so far these well this is more of a
lip color but really impressed so the
next thing I bought was this L'Oreal
voluminous superstar liquid eyeliner now
I am a total snob with liquid eyeliner
because the one I love the most is by
stylus there see let's say all day but
it's like almost twenty dollars so I
don't like repurchasing that but I
always end up repurchasing it because
it's the best it's the blackest it stays
the longest it doesn't move the
applicator is really easy to use this
one is similar this one is a little more
firm and it's pretty black but like
today I'm doing kind of more of an
ethereal look on my eyes which I don't
typically do and so I only use this and
I was like okay it's gotta be black
enough to cover any white shade that's
already on my eyelid and I think it did
an okay job I mean I didn't do a super
thick line but it's pretty darn black
but I will say sometimes covering like
glitter it doesn't do the best or at
least not as well as Stila does but it's
still really nice and in the drugstore
it's one of the best liquid liners I
have tried especially since the
applicator makes it really really really
easy to do like any sort of winged look
you might want because it's so firm and
then pointed the last thing I bought was
this voluminous superstar mascara from
L'Oreal now I have never liked the
primer then mascara type of thing
because I always feel like the white
shows through but I tried this brand
called manna that came in like a
subscription box of some kind and I was
like oh my gosh and it was a white
primer you put on then you put any
mascara over and it really lengthen my
lashes and it never
showed through and I was so impressed by
I thought you know maybe I've been wrong
all these years maybe the formulas
across the board have gotten better so I
was like I'm gonna try this voluminous
one because I love the regular L'Oreal
voluminous mascara
well it's step one on one side and it's
truly as a white mascara and then step 2
of course is the black one the same
shaped brush actually it's a little
different this one's more curved the
other one kind of splayed out on all
sides I like it I accidentally bought
the waterproof without realizing I
bought it so I didn't wear it today I
was gonna wear for the video but I
didn't because I thought I don't it's so
hard to get off that I almost don't want
to use this because it pulls out my
lashes so I want to get the regular
version and try that out but I didn't
want to put this on again because I've
worn it about five times then I knew I
did it wasn't the most extravagant
mascara I've ever used but it was okay
so I'm a little torn I wanna buy it
again to try the regular formula but at
the same time if I'm not impressed with
the waterproof
I don't know although they are different
formulas typically so those were all of
the things that I have bought recently
from the drugstore that are brand new I
will link everything I can find online
below I know sometimes it's tricky if
it's really really new to find it online
but I'll do my best to scour the
internet to find them hopefully you
enjoyed this and found it helpful if
you're interested in my other drugstore
hauls or drugstore makeup reviews I can
