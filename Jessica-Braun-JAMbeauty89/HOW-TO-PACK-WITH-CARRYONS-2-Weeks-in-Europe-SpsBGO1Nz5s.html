appearance I was gonna say experience
what am I saying
okay so today's going to be a very
informal video kind of vlog style I'm
just packing and I'm packing for a two
week trip it's actually a little bit
more than that I think we're going to
Ireland we're going all over we're
running a car and driving all over
Ireland staying in a different place
each night ending in Dublin for a few
days we'll stay there and then Tyler and
I are flying to Barcelona Spain and
we'll be there and I think we're
actually visiting a friend as well there
so that it's just going to be so much
fun I'm so excited but at the same time
that we're packing our apartments a mess
because we're moving into a house when
we get back so we've also packed a lot
of our house so if you see messiness in
the background I mean that's just real
life so I really I've got an idea of
what I'm packing I've kind of pulled
some things out of my closet so I'm
going to show you how I kind of choose
my outfits what I can cut out to be able
to carry everything on I'm not checking
any bags for this and in my experience I
feel like my husband's so good about
packing less but for me I'm like you
know I like to bring accessories I like
to have options but I think I've gotten
pretty good at pat yourself on the back
Jess I think I've gotten pretty good at
dwindling things that I really don't
need and you'll see as I pack that I'll
start to pull things out say do I really
need to bring this no I can use this
instead of this for this trip so
hopefully this is helpful for you I like
watching packing videos while I pack so
if that's what you're doing yay I hope
you have an awesome trip good luck
packing let's go and get into it okay so
I have my itinerary pulled up here
Tyler's a travel agent so when we travel
he's usually got everything pretty
cleaned out which is awesome anyway so
I've got things that I pulled out that I
think I might want to bring but now I'm
going to start creating outfits with
them and seeing okay which can I get
more than one use out of which can I not
and trying to weed out for example like
I've got we're going to Ireland for most
well yeah most of the time and it's a
lot cooler there and rainy most of the
time right now and then we're going to
Barcelona where it's really warm so I'm
trying to balance that out and find
things that I can layer with etc so it
makes packing really tricky especially
shoe wise which I'll get to in a minute
but what I always do when I pack is I
like to lay out everything
I might want to bring and then I start
making outfits with them and then
thinking about the shoes and seeing okay
what shoes go with them I know that for
example I know for example remembering
these sandals and then those black Nikes
over there and then I also have my
outfit set out for the airport and I'm
going to be wearing these Sperry little
rain boots just because they're the
biggest thing and I presume I won't be
able to fit at my luggage so I'm just
going to wear which kind of stinks but I
know that I'll be glad that I have them
when we're going through the national
parks and things like that okay so what
I've done is I have two shirts for every
color shorts or pants like I found that
packing for two kind of different
weather scenarios this is a great way to
do it so I have two shirts that both go
good with a green bottom so I have the
longer green bottoms and I have green
shorts I figure anything going with the
shorts will look just fine with these
sandals so that kind of works out then
I've got jeans which really I have two
pairs of jean shorts these are a little
more like dressy a little bit longer and
these are more like casual for the
daytime and then these I figure this and
like black leggings I kind of wear
interchangeably so these kind of go
together but these two tops would go
with these these two would go with these
but really the reality is any of these
tops could go with any of them so
anytime I'm wearing long pants I'm
probably going to be wearing these when
we're in Ireland I am bringing these my
black and I keys these are actually my
old ones I just clean them up because I
figure this is that I didn't want to
mess up my brand new ones and I figure
that's a great way like to say if it
does end up raining when I'm wearing
these I know on my boots I'm not too
concerned about them getting all messy
and stuff now my trick is bring two
cardigans these are actually the exact
same style cardigan they're really
simple I got them from where did I open
and Republic I'm sure I bought at the
outlet not the actual Banana Republic
anyway I have it in grey and I have it
in this dark green and I figure this is
the perfect thing to throw on if it's
chilly and even if it's chilly at night
in Barcelona so that's just a great way
to not bring a bunch of long-sleeve
shirts but at least have a way to make
all of these shirts work even when it's
chilly
I'm bringing one dress and then this is
what I've already weeded out these are
things I pulled out thinking I was going
to bring in as I put things together I
realize you know I really don't need any
more dressy tops they don't need another
sweater that shirt or shorts I don't
need two pairs of jeans I'm thinking
about bringing this we're meeting up
with our friend Carla in Spain she lives
there and her I'm just so excited to
your hometown anyway and I figure if we
go out for drinks or something I would
want to wear this is kind of like a
backless little like romper but I never
get to wear it here so I figured that'd
be a time to wear it and I don't think
it's going to take up much room because
it's really really thin so now the other
thing that's important when you're
packing for things like this is to bring
really easy to mix and match shirt so
like my favorite kind I'm pretty sure oh
this is from made well they sell these
at Target I have a bunch from Target as
well they're just really simple v-neck
shirts short sleeve I have some these
are from Target I'm pretty sure these
are just long-sleeve I don't know what
I'm gonna bring all of these but like
these are great because if you end up
like not being able to do laundry like
you think you might be able to you've
got these as backup you can sleep in
them you can workout in them you can
just straight up wear them out I mean
there's so many scenarios where you know
a lot of these tops I'm bringing are
really kind of dressy and cute but it's
nice to have an option or two like this
I also have a black and a white little
camisole these are great because they
can add an extra layer of warmth under
your clothing but also if you end up
putting on a shirt you're like gosh this
is more seekers than I thought or
whatever you have this and again you can
sleep in them you can workout in them
and they really don't take up much room
I wouldn't say anyone needs any more
than two unless you wear one underneath
your shirt like every day but great
thing to bring I'm thinking about only
bringing one of these long-sleeve ones
though I feel like I don't need both I
think I might bring the mm-hmm
this is gray this one's looking a little
dingy so I feel like I'll leave that but
bring the gray one and if I do bring the
gray one I might we're going to be doing
some hiking this is just some a like
vest a gh back vest so I'm thinking I
could put that over that and that's an
outfit for one of those days and I know
I'd be really warm in that another thing
I always
do is I have something to hold my shoes
in you can use anything I mean people
using my gallon sized bags will just use
grocery bags it doesn't matter but I
like to have it separate this I finally
invested in because we travel all the
time but if you don't travel all the
time you don't need to invest in
something but I can usually fit two to
three pairs of shoes depending in here
and then like I said I'm going to wear
the boots as far as I know so that is
just one thing it's nice to wrangle them
they're not getting your clothes dirty
but also it's just I feel like it saves
a little bit of space because it holds
them together a little bit more I'm
going to bring this top two it's great
over leggings because it's longer and I
was actually going to wear it to the
airport and then I realized you know
what no because it's going to look
wrinkly and crazy and I don't know that
it'd be super comfortable to wear on the
long flight so I'm going to pack this so
because I just love this I think it's so
cute
so I think I'm going to try to pack
without packing cubes I want to pack it
vertically only because we're not going
to be staying in the same place for very
long
pretty much every night we moved to a
new place and then we stay in Dublin for
a while then we stay in Barcelona for a
while so packing cubes are great if
you're able to unpack because you can
just take everything out of it once
you're there but for this it doesn't
make sense for me to unpack every single
day to try to find my outfit to me it
makes more sense to just have it so I
can grab the shirt I want and grab the
pants so hopefully that will work out
and you'll be able to see what I mean
but if you do like packing cubes which I
do like them for trips where like I said
these Eagle Creek compression ones are
amazing I have these my husband has
these I think his are like black so he
likes the black ones these are amazing
because they squeeze your clothes a
little bit tighter these I just recently
bought from Cal pack and it's just a
bunch of different ones I might so use
these for like undergarments and things
like this things like that but we'll see
but I'm going to try to pack my clothes
in a different way let's see how it
works so this is how I'm folding them
this is kind of my version of the con
maru' way I'm not a pro by any means I
literally just now looked it up on
YouTube because I forgot how to do it
the way I'm doing it so I can get them
like that is I kind of fold it like
halfway in like that usually if you've
got sleeves it's a little trickier and
then I've been doing that folding it
like that
and then folding it in thirds so kind of
almost rolling it and then it's pretty
thin it's going to be able to be stored
in there like that
okay so swimsuit wise I have this I kind
of mix and match and target the other
day this little white crocheted bikini
but I also have these so this does not
go together but I would totally wear
together something it's fun but I could
always put that with that or I could put
that with that so I like that I can mix
and match so I think if you have the
ability to mix and match and you can
bring two that's just kind of fun
because it gives you more options with
your swimsuits if you're going to
swimming on your vacation another tip I
have is to bring a book bag now I'm not
actually going to be wearing this book
bag on the plane this will actually be
my carry-on that goes under the seat
although it's pretty big but I usually
throw like my actual person here things
like that but this is what I'm going to
pack so when we're hiking or even when
we're just out and about shopping if I
need like maybe we're going to be gone
and I'm going to need sunscreen and a
water bottle things like that will fit a
little bit better in here and be a
little bit more comfortable on my back
so that I'm actually going to fold up
and put underneath maybe underneath my
shoes here just so I have it once we're
there okay so my clothes are all packed
I ended up deciding not to bring this
little romper this was a swimsuit
cover-up I figure I can just wear shorts
and a tank top I took out these shorts
so now I only have two pairs of shorts
these I already showed you and that was
from earlier so I did end up weeding
some things out just when I as I'm
packing I realized gosh I could totally
wear this instead of this or like I
could wear this dress as a swimsuit
cover-up if I really wanted to or my I
have one workout outfit I could totally
wear that over a swimsuit you know what
I mean
so I have all of my shirts here dress
pants these are so leggings my green
pants and my jeans this is a little vest
that I just really want to wear I
thought about not taking it but I was
like you know what Isis I want to bring
it these are all extra not extras these
are all kind of random things like my
workout outfit my the little tank tops
I'm bringing like undershirt camisole
kind of thing so that's what they
then I have one set of PJs that are easy
to grab this is really all I'm bringing
for pajamas because I figure if I'm cold
I can throw on one of my sweaters I
could wear the leggings instead for
pajamas
I could wear any of the tank tops or
v-neck shirts so that's all I'm bringing
and then these are my shorts I just have
on the bottom because I figure I won't
need them till towards the end of my
trip so all of that fits pretty well in
there and I love that I'll be able to
take a shirt out and be able to just not
mess with the rest of my clothes and
feel like I need to unpack every time
there's something so satisfying about
like the finals that part when it all
fits really really well and it's not
like too tight or too much in there I
love that ok so this is my little Vera
Bradley like hanging organizer and I
don't always travel with this but I
usually go between something like this
but for me since again we're going to be
in a different place every night it's
really convenient to just hang this in
the bathroom my makeups down here
brushes here everything else here
obviously my liquids bag has a lot of my
makeup has a lot of other things but
usually once I land and we're checked
into wherever we're saying the first
night I'll kind of reorganize so all my
makeup is together and then I'll have
like my skincare and shower stuff in
here so that I can easily just grab this
bag and know that I've got what I need
to shower with anyways so this is just
really nice if you want to see what's in
here what makeup I'm bringing and what's
in here I'm doing a separate video if it
is up I will link it below but the way
that I did it I have one of these little
lei and go cosmetic things and I'll give
you a quick sneak peek if you want in
here this is great because you literally
just open myself to turn to do it
one-handed and it lays flat and all your
makeups there and then when you're done
you just kind of cinch it back together
again this is hard to do one-handed but
it's so great it's so convenient and I
realized when I'm traveling for long
periods of time this is totally the best
way to do it ok so it's little squished
I had to do some wiggling around I
wasn't going to bring this as a little
travel blow dryer I wasn't going to
bring it but since we're staying in so
many different places actually Airbnb
ease that we're staying in the entire
trip some of them will have a blow dryer
some won't so I figured you know what
I'll just bring it to be safe I actually
have my little curling wand
Nissa my shoes are kind of squished but
that's alright I fit this in and then
these are all my undergarments and
things like that I took out the book bag
I might just have to put this in my
other carry-on okay so both sides are
closed this is a little bit this is a
little bit harder to close but these are
really well made at least this part is
so I'm by the way this is a Rimowa it
was really expensive with a birthday
gift and it's already ripped in one spot
right here isn't that terrible so I was
really bummed so I contacted customer
service and they're going to fix it for
me for free to have I think like a
lifetime guarantee or something which
they showed because they're stupid
expensive I honestly don't recommend it
I recommend Cal pack has some great ones
that are still expensive but they're a
little cheaper I think they're a little
bit more well made in my opinion I also
really like the Delsea ones ok I will
link those below I'll link this as well
as other luggage that I would recommend
if you travel a lot down below alright
let's move on to my carry-on bag ok so
this is my little jewelry box I really I
used to like plan my jewelry to go with
each outfit but I really just I stick to
the staples so when I travel and really
in life so like I like these little fake
diamond studs I like my little silver
ball one and I love these rose gold ones
so those will probably be three earrings
sometimes I'll bring one or two like
fond pairs of earrings I don't even
remember we have all these chokers too
so let me go through this and I'll show
you what I'm bringing ok don't mind the
dirty countertop I'm we're moving like
literally right and we get back so I'm
not concerned about it anyway ok so
these are the only bracelets I'm
bringing these are these sweet little
like disney bracelets maybe I will bring
a watch but this is like a really fun
choker that I really like like you tie
up a couple times I love this necklace
right here and I bring one silver
necklace that says J and one gold bar
necklace and then you saw my earrings
I'm also going to bring those and then
these are big old gold hoops so that's
all I'm gonna bring I like to keep it
simple like I said so I bought this
little cute holder on HauteLook a while
ago I'll link hautelook below it's just
it's like Nordstrom Rack kind of really
good deals so all of that fits in there
since I'm not
much I don't worry about tangling I
don't usually have an issue with things
getting tangled because I don't have
that much and it really can't move much
in here this is the only thing that
won't fit in so I'll figure that out but
I am wearing one of the necklaces as
well when I'm on this light so other
things I need to pack these are we need
two different just put that in there
it's probably not good for it but anyway
these are some different adapters one
for Ireland one for Spain and then this
is one that does it all so I'm bringing
this as my main one but then I'm just
going to have these as well just in case
and Tyler has his own he's bringing so
we don't have to share which is nice I
also have like a little external power
cord thing tissues this is like my
little medicine thing this is actually
really neat you can fit a bunch of stuff
up here I've actually labeled the
medicine but I bought this on Amazon
I'll link it below it's awesome because
I've got everything I need I even have a
zip talk in the back with band-aids
things like that so these are some of
the things I have my liquids bag in here
the book bag I told you some things I'm
thinking about this is my pillow which I
am going to bring but this is like a
travel blanket I don't know it just
unzips to be a blanket which is great I
don't know I might we'll see how much
room I have I don't usually bring it but
it is nice for longer flights to have
that okay my I have my little Chargers
in this little bag or not the chargers I
have the electrical outlet kind of
converters in there I put that jewelry
and stuff in there
there's my liquids bag I've got a
magazine this is actually really cool
this is one of those little pouches
where you can organize your things
so says digital so I have like my extra
charger headphones
things like that in there and then it
says Travel ID so I can put my ticket
and things like that in there Aero stuff
so in here I have I just have these
little Victoria's Secret it's a little
eye mask
I don't always have them but again on
longer flights I've got some hair ties
some bobby pins I'd put my chapstick in
there once it goes through the liquids I
have gum little things and then on the
back side it says jet comfort actually
that's where I should put the
the first should put this anyway so it's
just nice because this is one of those I
got one for my husband too that you can
just pull this out of your bag and know
you've got almost everything you need
for your flight now in here I have a
notebook I've got my Kindle I have my
iPad with the keyboard so that I can
like pipe I don't know whatever I'll be
doing and then this is the person bring
I got this at Target I need to actually
cut the tags off before we go it's the
perfect size because I can actually only
need to take those eye drops out I can
actually fit everything in it I bought a
smaller wallet so I can fit a lot more
in this purse because that wallets so
small I have glasses sunglasses in there
I probably do have chapstick my phone
fits in the front pocket really well and
that's about it so this will be what I'm
hearing around most of the time but its
small enough that I can just put it
right in here and it fits no problem now
what's nice about bags like this is if
you check before you buy it because a
lot of bags have this they'll have this
little slot where you can just slide
this right through it so it stays on if
your bag doesn't have that they do sell
and I've already packed it for the move
but they do sell these little like brass
rings I can link them below that you can
like hook onto here and then hook onto
there really quickly and it holds it
together at least in that way I've used
those in the past with no problem you
know it might kind of slide off to the
side sometimes but if you're careful I
mean it holds it together so at least
it's not falling completely off without
you knowing so that is everything I know
this is a really informal packing video
I can make my pass
packing videos down below if you want to
see how I use to pack I really have
dwindled it down a lot by the way I did
end up fitting in the blanket and the
pillow in there and if I feel like we're
not flying until tomorrow feel tomorrow
when we're actually about to leave that
I need more room in that bag then the
blankets going to be the first thing to
go but if not I mean that's great but
I'll be able to carry both of these on
the luggage on the bottom will obviously
go in the overhead bin and this once I
think the blanket out it really is small
enough to fit in the area under the seat
in front of me which is really nice
because you can fit a lot in it it's
easier than you think to carry
everything on I will say that and then
there's no chance of lost luggage things
like that
as far as getting all your liquids in
the liquid bag so for that I will link
that video if it's up below so you can
see what I'm bringing and there are just
certain things I decided not to bring
for one reason or another so stay tuned
for that I hope you'll subscribe in the
meantime and I'll see you guys in my
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
