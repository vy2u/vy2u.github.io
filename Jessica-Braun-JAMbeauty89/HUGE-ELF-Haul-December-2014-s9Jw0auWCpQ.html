humongous alcohol for you guys this was
actually stuff that was sent to me it
wasn't things that I purchased myself
but I'm really excited to show them some
of these things as I kind of went
through the box I they were things that
I've already used but they were maybe in
different shades or they're brand new
products that I haven't tried so I'm
really excited to show these to you guys
because there's a lot here and a lot of
them I'm really excited to eventually
try and then review guys so to start off
they first this is gonna be all out of
order because it all got mixed up but if
I took things out and tried them sorry
so the first thing this is the
contouring blush and bronzing cream and
this is in the shade Saint Lucia or st.
Lucia and it's their typical duos that
they sell but it's in cream formula so
these I have not tried out yet but
there's certainly wearable colors
although I will say the bronzer looks
kind of more orange tinted than what I
typically wear but that seems to be
standard for me with the bronzers that
elf has in these duos they're beautiful
and I'll still use them to bronze my
face but for contouring they're not I
mean they're not really made for that so
they're certainly not useful for me in
that way but excited to try these with a
stipple brush probably their stipple
brush that I'll try it with so I was
excited about that because I had no idea
they were selling that in the cream
formula that was pretty awesome
I also have the contouring blush and
bronzing powder in Fiji but it's their
matte version again had no idea that
they were selling these these I have
tried but they're completely matte which
was just so excited and they're
beautiful these I have worn a little bit
and I really really liked them so I'm
excited to play with this some more
because that's what I've been waiting
for from them you know I think a lot of
us have been willing waiting for elf to
come out with matte formula so yay let's
see more of their duos they sent me the
elf turks and caicos I don't know
we're saying that right and then they
also sent me Antigua duo and then also
st. Lucia but like the powder formula
not the cream one so those were all the
duo's they sent me I've tried one of
these before I don't remember it might
have been st. Lucia and I used to have
it but I no longer have I don't remember
if I gave it away or what happened to it
but I'm excited I think the one that I'm
the most excited about is Antigua let me
just open and look at it up close
because it's got this really beautiful
doll pink if I can get that little
plastic off but it's this really
beautiful baby doll pink that I love so
I'm really excited it does have shimmer
but I don't mind that in a blush so I
this is probably gonna be the one that I
use the most out of all of them just cuz
I love the shade of that wash it's so
beautiful the next thing they sent me
were their blush palettes now I did own
the dark palette no I think I owned both
and I ended up giving them to some
sisters just because I had decluttered a
bit and it was getting rid of blush and
now I've got even more but these really
it was one of those things that after I
gave the way I was like man I kind of
wish I had it cuz I'm see it in videos
and like oh that is beautiful I didn't
think to wear it that way things like
that so I am excited about them I'm sure
I will get more use out of the light so
pulling it out it just comes like this
and it's got the four different shades
in it and of course these are lighter
the other ones are darker but they are
beautiful and gosh talk about bang for
your buck these are obviously really
inexpensive I mean all of these are but
this has so many colors and so many
different things you could do with them
you could almost use this one as like a
bronzer certainly an orangish bronzer
but you really could so I love that it
is quite a range of colors the dark one
is of course much darker and it
certainly has some like really really
dark colors this one is almost like a
red this one is really beautiful
especially in the winter both of these
are because you can certainly share them
out if you apply them with a stipple
brush they'll go on a lot less pigmented
but out of these I really like this when
this one reminds me of Heather silk from
wet and wild they're of course insanely
pigmented and just beautiful
beautiful they also sent some brushes
and these I thought as I glanced at them
I'm like oh yeah I've tried those and
there are some wait wait wait no I
haven't the first one is these are from
their studio lines that are usually
about three dollars this is their crease
brush now this is much more along the
lines of a lot of professional makeup
brushes the shape of this is so I'm
really excited about this it's really
thin so you can really get in the crease
with it and of course it's called a
crease brush so that makes sense the
next one is their blending brush again
three dollars they feel really soft and
these brushes hold up really well I've
found tons elf brushes this is their
blending brush and it's just a little
bit thicker so you could I mean clearly
it's meant for blending but you could
even pack color on the lid you could put
it in the crease I mean whatever you
want for a buffer color it would work
for that as well these are three dollars
these are ones that I'll probably end up
using more than anything in the universe
because they end up being the bomb and I
love the shape and they're really soft
so yes I'll so excited that they finally
have those out because they're just a
little bit different than what they've
already had out there I wise so let's
see gosh there's a lot they also sent me
two of their concealer palettes I've
never owned or tried these and I'm
really excited
they sent me light and medium which is
great I mean obviously I'd be light but
it was thoughtful of them to send me
both just in case and the light is got
it has four shades it looks like they're
all really similar but just a little bit
different undertones so that's always
nice I want to see how creamy these are
oh whoa these are crazy creamy and they
blend out beautifully I'm actually
really excited to use these now products
like this don't work for me as well
under my eyes so I end up using them to
cover blemishes on my face so you know
it's super creamy though so I'm
wondering it might actually be really
nice like they eat pearl one that's what
it feels like to me and you know it's
nice if your skin tone changes
throughout the year this is the perfect
product cuz it kind of runs the gamut
the medium looks like it
the colors differ a little bit more from
each other than the
the brush fell out then the light ones
do but again lots of different
undertones and I just think this is a
cool product it comes with a little
brush that just has one end that's
really thin that I don't know but you
never know when you're in a pinch and
you maybe forgot a certain brush you
never know when you might use that so
very cool the next thing this I was
really intrigued by it's their HD
mattifying bomb and it almost looks like
a powder like container but it is this
bomb like it literally feels like a lip
balm but it has that silicone feel to it
when you blend it you know or you kind
of rub it together and so in my head
it's kind of similar like a primer
because clearly it's supposed to go
underneath your foundation powder
whatever it feels like there's silicone
primers like the Smashbox one etc where
it just fills in any of those
imperfections to kind of make it a
smooth base I have a feeling on dry skin
this might not work as well just because
I feel like primers like that in general
don't work as well dry skin because it
just almost accentuates the dryness but
I haven't tried this yet so I'm excited
right now I've got so much dry skin
right here it's crazy in it feel it felt
like it happened overnight so I'm like I
was on Vitacost the other day buying a
ton of different moisturizers because I
was just like I need to find something
that's awesome in the winter cuz I'm
really yeah it makes you not want to put
on makeup because you just feel it you
can see it you know what I mean no
amount of setting spray is helping
enough so I will try this and see how it
goes on dry skin but it is pretty
interesting and it does come with like a
sponge type thing which that would be
incredibly bizarre to apply with it but
I think you could just use your fingers
maybe a brush but I feel like your
fingers will do fine but I'm excited to
give it a try cos I've never tried
anything like that okay the next thing
they sent me it must be their entire
line of smudge pots um they sent me
ain't that sweet back to basics
brownie points i gosh
got a glow pearls of wisdom hit the town
this is crazy
hoppin party ocean bound and cruising
chic that was a lot so just
get them like for example pop and party
is like this deeper purple color don't
know that I'm ever going to use that to
be completely candid so some of these I
just might not open and I might give to
a girlfriend or a sister ocean bound is
this deep blue you know some of these
it's just knowing me and knowing that I
usually don't do crazy looks like that I
probably won't use the darker however
the ones that are more like taupey or
like gold I probably will use so I'm
gonna open this dotted glow one I want
to know what it so it's just in a little
pot little jar oh it's whoa
you could almost like scoop some of it
out if you know what I mean
it certainly is glowy and pretty now how
long it will stay is my next question
cuz it blends very nicely it's really
soft almost like a moosie texture if
you've ever used these and there's no
like glitter at least in this one which
is nice because sometimes like I used
today on my lid let's skate from Mac it
was one of their paint pots but the
glitter in it just always looks a little
bit chunky and I like their parts of my
look today than like that just looks
chunky and I was trying to blend it out
but there's something about the glitter
in that one that kind of rubs me the
wrong way to be honest but these pots
are really really cheap I want to say
they're under three dollars and they
have so many colors so for if you are
looking for what I mean that feels
really nice but I'll have to get back to
you guys on how these wear because I am
curious but they certainly have a range
of colors looking at ain't that sweet it
reminds me of let's skate it's like a
light pink there's this white one called
pearls of wisdom which would be great to
put underneath bright eyeshadows to make
them pop even more if you're into that
and then back to basics looks like a
really nice taupe color so let's see oh
and then this would look similar to this
is cruising chic they look very very
similar but back to basics is a little
bit more gold so those are kind of the
ones that I will probably keep hit the
town is also really dark so I probably
won't keep
so they also sent me their 11 piece
brush collection which I see these you
know you can get crazy good deals on
these all the time on their website or
just a good sale since you know there I
just love this brand because it is so
inexpensive for what you get now this
might be something I end up passing on
as a gift because I have all these
brushes but it comes in this container
here and it's I love you know this
really is a great thing for travel
because for me you guys know I travel
all the time and it's got the you know
any size brush could kind of fit in
these little elastic parts which I
really like but it's got some of my
favorites there complexion brush is a
really beautiful kind of big one to use
for powder or blush or contour I mean
anything really um looking through these
what else do I really like oh gosh their
powder brush is the best it's the
softest it's really you know kind of
dense without being too dense you can
use it for foundation for anything
powder but it's just so beautiful those
are kind of the standout ones their eye
brushes are all good and they have a lot
of those in here too and really in their
line of brushes it's worth it to splurge
for the studio line which they're the
brushes of three dollars each instead of
the essentials there are a few good
essentials eye brushes but their face
brushes are really rough and I always
feel like I'm tearing up my skin when
I've used those dollar ones so it's
worth the splurge to spend three dollars
per brush or maybe get a set because
they really are better than the
essentials line so elf also sent me
these gift sets and there are four of
them and so basically it's a you keep
one for yourself and you get one away
and the whole idea is you can buy these
and you can keep one for yourself and
then they give you one already wrapped
in this adorable messy glitter packaging
with the bow so you can take the bowl
off and retie it on to the present and I
think that's just so cute cuz you know
sometimes I don't know as you get older
you get this sounds terrible and I know
it's gonna come out wrong but sometimes
you get older you get less gifts and
obviously Christmas is not about the
gifts and you've got I mean duh but at
the same time it's kind of nice to treat
yourself sometimes and you know with
makeup that's something like no one buys
me makeup because well clearly I have
enough of it but you know I feel like a
lot of people don't buy other people
makeup so if that's something you love
you almost have to
by it for yourself to get what you want
I know it sounds terrible but some of
you will know what I mean I just said it
so you can buy one for yourself but they
give one as a gift and I thought that's
a cute idea I just love the idea behind
that so there are four different things
one I kept packaged so you could see how
it comes when you order it but it's a
package of lashes and there are three
different types of lashes now obviously
I don't really wear lashes so I'll
probably pass both of these on but it's
cute and again I love it the other sets
one of my favorites is this elf full
lips set and it comes with a long wear
lip liner pencil a lipstick and it's one
of their moisturizing lipsticks and one
of their matte lip colors these are all
a bright red which is beautiful actually
I think the lipstick might be more of a
pink but either way I think these are
beautiful I love their matte lip colors
so much so very excited about that and
again it came with a wrapped version
behind it as well there's also the elf
cheeky glow which is basically this trio
with a highlight blush and contour and
it also comes with a blush a brush to
use with it and these look like they're
all matte which i think is fantastic and
so rare it reminds me of the NARS ones
and just really cool again it came with
the second one to give to a friend and
then the elf perfect eyes set it comes
with this ten pan shadow palette which
are gorgeous I mean there's Gold's that
remind me of CAF baked from Urban Decay
this looks like The Naked palette to be
honest it's beautiful and then it also
comes with the mascara and a liner and
eyeliner so very very cool so because
they sent me these sets I am going to
give one lucky winner one of each of
these so you will receive they'll all be
wrapped in the cute little packaging you
will receive one thing of the lashes the
full lips set the cheeky glow and the
perfect eyes set so you'll receive all
for a second place winner will receive
another set of the lashes since I just
know that I'm not going to wear them and
four of the smudge pops I was sent so

town and brownie points you will also
receive
the 11 piece brush collection because I
