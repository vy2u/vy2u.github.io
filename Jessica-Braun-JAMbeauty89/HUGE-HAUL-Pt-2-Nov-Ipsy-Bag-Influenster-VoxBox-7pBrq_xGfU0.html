two of my huge haul so in part one which
I will link below I featured what I
bought at Sephora in the drugstore a lot
of different things that I got really
good deals on and in it I kind of
explain how I got how I saved a lot of
money on those products so definitely
check that out because then that one
it's a lot more makeup this one has a
lot of makeup as well but that one has
even more oh okay so this one I'm
featuring the November FC bag which
comes in a little thing like this and
then also the Rose box box that I got
from Influenster Influenster so we'll
start with the Ipsy bag if si.com and
I'll link it below is the website you
can join where for $10 a month and you
can cancel at any time really easily and
I say that because I've canceled it
before and then I like instantly
regretted it and I joined again the next
month I was like dang it I'm just a
really good bag so it's $10 a month and
you get a makeup bag and it's different
each month depending on whatever the
theme is for that month this month's new
theme is called glam it up and it came
with this bag here with a little pink
with the gold not the best made bag this
time around other times I've gotten
really nice one so it's kind of hit or
miss when it comes to the bag
however I've decided started keeping
these and a lot of them I just used to
give gifts in like if I give makeup to a
friend or a sister I'll save these bags
and use them and give those away cuz you
know over the course of a year if you've
had it all year you've got 12 makeup
bags you don't need that many so perfect
for gift-giving anyway
they come with at least 5 products
sometimes more this time it came with
six products five of them were full full
full size which shocked me I'm so
excited so we'll go ahead and start with
my favorite which is the pixie they call
it's a bronzer it's called the Beauty
bronzer and it's in the shade subtly sun
touched really really cute packaging and
pixie I know you can buy at Target and
also online it almost it's really a
light bronzer it almost looks glittery
but it's really not I can still use it
as a bronzer because I have such fair
skin you can kind of see a swatch of it
they're kind of not I love this
I love love love and I've already used
it so much and I think because I have
such fair skin it works I think if you
have any darker skin than me it wouldn't
work as a bronzer they do have other
shades though and I really like the
formula so that was awesome
it also came with this be a bombshell
lip crayon let's see
and it's this oh my gosh
it's like a matte color a color I would
never really wear but maybe like you
know what I mean
it is so beautiful and I just the
formula just glides right on so I
haven't gotten weird on my lips yet but
I can't wait oh my gosh are you kidding
me look at that color so I was really
excited about that one it also came with
this full-sized starlooks gym pencil and
it's in the shade amethyst now this one
I've used a lot too because it is so
pretty it's like this purplish silver it
is so pretty on the lower lash line and
when this light hits it just right it is
gorgeous so so far that's three
full-size products onto the next this is
the end by Michelle Phan her makeup line
that she started it's a mascara and it's
the lash gallery mascara and I think
it's a waterproof and it's it's a
dramatic volume look how cute this
packaging is is that not adorable I just
think it's so cute another full-size
product so again an awesome
we got a full-size nail polish it's the
nail tini brand and it is in the shade
caviar cocktail and it's just this
beautiful like steel gray just so
beautiful it's gonna be so pretty in the
winter I can't wait I need to boil it
already is winter I don't know what I'm
waiting on I'm definitely gonna pay my
nails at this soon and then the the
sixth item that I got was the glam glow
which I was like losing my mind when I
open this the glam glow youth mud tingle
exfoliate treatment which I've heard
such good things about this company so I
cannot wait to give this a try then I
also got two more products for free from
Ipsy because when you refer friends you
get oopsy points and I think every
thousand MC points you get you can pick
there are a few items they have up for
like that you can get I've got two
different things I got the Kitsch hair
ties which I was so excited about just
really really cute I wear this kind of
hair tie most of the time so I was
really excited to get that for free and
then I also got the bad gal lash mascara
from benefit just like a deluxe size and
that was free as well so I thought that
was pretty darn awesome I was so excited
and the thing about deluxe mascaras
sizes is that I pretty much can use this
for as long as I would use a full-size
mascara so it really doesn't make a
difference to me so I was so excited was
tons of stuff to get for ten dollars
I mean for ten dollars I can get a
lipstick at the drugstore these days so
for all of those products that was
awesome so that will be linked below if
you're interested certainly is worth it
and you also get like a little card that
has like percent off offers for all the
companies that you got products from so
that was pretty awesome let me wipe off
all these swatches okay so now onto the
box box this was called the rose box box
and actually it was supposed to ship to
me like a couple weeks ago and there was
a mixup so I just now got it which is
ridiculous but it was free because
basically on the website and for this
I'll link below as well you review
products you answer questions about
products you ask questions about
products and the more you are involved
the more likely you are to get something
sent to your house so that being said
you I mean this is one of my favorites
so I got the dr. Scholl's for her cozy
cushions inserts and you can use them
with boots and I'm so excited cuz
they're furry and I wear boots most of
the time even when I'm teaching so I'm
on my feet a lot it's gonna be so nice
to have an insert in there if I like
these a lot I might buy them for my main
couple pair of boots so that we've got
them in each pair cuz this is awesome I
mean I am so excited to try this it also
came with like some snacks
I thought was interesting the lint
Lindor truffle and milk chocolate which
I know I love these they're just melt in
your mouth and then the Velveeta
breakfast biscuit sits in blueberry
which I've never had and I love things
like this with black coffee so I'll
probably having that on a nice Sunday
morning with my coffee and then came
with some makeup items it came with this
kiss gradation polishes I'm probably not
saying that right I don't know but I
think it's talking about the gradient
how it goes from one to the next to the
next kind of like an ombre thing kind of
so but it looks the college's looking
really pretty I'll have to try this out
there's instructions and see how I like
it maybe even let you guys know and then
it also came with this Rimmel
scandaleyes retro glam mascara I haven't
even seen this in stores yet so it might
not well it's probably I don't know but
that's what the brush looks like I'm
pretty excited to try it and what's so
fun about influencers it's usually new
products and that's why companies are
willing to send them to you because they
want you to review them whether it be on
a YouTube channel on Instagram on
Twitter you know whatever or on a blog
so what's nice is most of the products
you get from them are brand new products
that are just on the market or maybe
even not even out yet so that you can
get get the word out because of course
word of mouth is one of the most
powerful advertising tools there is so
really really cool program I'll link
that below as well I hope that that was
enjoyable and that maybe learn something
new about some different websites that
are out there and not as all I'll catch
you guys very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
