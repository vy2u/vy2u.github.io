world's at large rush hey everyone its
Jessica and I this is probably going to
be a long video and I'm just gonna warn
you now I might split it up into two but
I might just leave it in one so if you
want to watch it all great if you don't
skip through don't watch it all whatever
you need to do because that's kind of
sometimes with longer videos all like
add it to my watch later playlist and
when I know that I've got like 20 to 30
minutes to kill I'll just sit and like
watch that video you know what I'm
saying so this is gonna be a longer one
I warned you so no complaints cuz I
warned you so this is going to be a haul
slash swap with a friend of mine named
amber and I met her on Instagram and we
started corresponding through email and
then we started texting back and forth
and we decided to do this swap and oh my
goodness she sent me so many goodies
like I literally am pretty sure I cried
and I'm kind of filming this with a
heavy heart because I had filmed this
whole video of me unboxing it and
unwrapping it for the first time and I
was just so excited and this was on
Thursday that I got the package and
let's see how did it all come to play
basically I haven't had time until today
Sunday to sit down and like edit it so I
sat down to edit it and then suddenly I
saw I couldn't find the video anywhere
it wasn't on my phone which is what I
film with it wasn't like anywhere it
wasn't on my computer it was nowhere to
be found I don't know what happened and
so now I'm having to film it again which
is fine but I'm sad because Amber's not
getting to see how excited I was to open
all this stuff the good news is I did
get some pictures of how she had it all
wrapped up and all that kind of stuff
think she sent me she sent it to me in
this box with this really cute like tape
and stuff like that and I don't even
know where to begin
okay I'll start with the nail polishes
because she sent me so many new horses
I'm wearing one of them right now on my
nails and on in
I have a photo this pink one which is if
I can find it here this this is an Essie
nail polish on Madison Avenue so cute
and so I really love that pink it
reminds me of Japanese rose garden by
OPI which is one of my favorites but I'm
almost it's almost gone basically and I
just love this so she sent me a ton of
Essie nail polishes we've got tart deco
which is like this really like peachy
colored one mint candy apple which I
actually don't own it I'm so excited
because I never owned it and I actually
am kind of a need of a true mint nail
polish so it's exciting mod square which
is another kind of pink color a little
bit deeper I think then the Madison Ave
hue or maybe it's just more of a true
pink this is a mod square and this is
Madison Avenue so this has more of a
kulish purple tone to it blue tone I
mean so yeah another this is almost like
a berry color in big splendor no big
spender I should know that I know
musicals and that's from Sweet Charity
the musical big spender bikini so teeny
which I've been wanting for so so long
and I was like flipping out I cannot
wait to wear this oh my goodness I love
it and then she sent some like lavender
lilac colors this is in go Ginza if I'm
even saying that right it's a really
light purple so beautiful and then
another one that's a little bit darker
called bond with whomever which is so
pretty and this is like lilacs and
lavenders are one of my favorite
favorite favorite nail polish colors so
I'm really excited about those and then
this kind of like uh well it's called
watermelon I was gonna say kind of like
a fruity color watermelon that's what
it's called it's so pretty
and then bachelorette bash which is like
a hot pink it is so cute oh my gosh so
she sent me all those Essie nail
polishes then she also sent me this
nicole by OPI color it's from the Selena
Gomez line it's just called Selena it's
like this beautiful it reminds me of
tart deco but Pinker um if that makes
any more any sense I love it I painted
my nails with this first thing when I
got it because it's just
the prettiest color I'm so excited about
that and then this covergirl outlast
stay brilliant nail polish in peaches
and cream this is the first one of these
I've owned I've never owned one so I
can't wait to try this out and let you
guys know how I like the formula so and
on top of that okay this one literally
made me tear up because amber like just
pays such good attention that she knew
that I love Disney that I love Minnie
Mouse and so she sent me this from OPI
and it is the Couture day mini and it
has these four little mini OPI nail
colors there's like a kind of a I don't
know if you guys can see I'm trying to
get the glare to go away but there's
like this light pink there these oh my
gosh it is just so cute like it's hard
to describe just look at them I'll be
wearing them off and on I'll let you
guys know when I wear them they are so
cute and that was so thoughtful
and I like literally jump for joy but
this one and my boyfriend was laughing
so hard at me when I told him about this
and he was excited too because he loves
Disney TV's like that is really cool so
oh so those are all the nail polishes
she sent me and guys we haven't even
gotten started let's go into mascara
Xiaomi shall we so she sent me five
different mascaras oh my goodness
I did not wait and she was so thoughtful
because a lot of these things she sent
me things that I use all the time that
she knew her favorites of mine she sent
me like backup stuff so that was like
awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
awesome awesome so this one I've never
tried this is the great lash lots of
lashes by Maybelline now I've tried the
original great lash and I did not like
it at all so I'm hoping to like this one
I'm excited to give it a try and let you
guys know I'm all of these are in like
blackest black or very black and I think
she I think none of them are waterproof
which is nice because I really don't
wear waterproof mascara very much unless
like I'm at the pool I guess it on so
I'm really excited to give that a try
and then she got me a backup of the
rocket which you guys know I love and
it's in blackest black freaking perfect
ears and another one that I really like
is the one by one and she got me this
one as well so I'm so excited to have
another one of those because this one's
really getting like dried up and I'm
kind of sad
so uh all right okay this is the
covergirl clump crusher I've been
wanting to try it and I haven't bought
it yet which is so surprising to me but
I tried to buy too many mascaras because
I'm like you know if I open them all
around the same time they're gonna dry
up and then I'm going to throw away a
ton of mascaras so I try not to buy too
many but I'm so excited about this one
so I'll let you guys know how I like it
and then we've got the Physicians
Formula organic where glam white guru
talks about this all the time I think
her name is Tati and um I was just so
excited to try it and um so she got this
for me and I cannot wait to see if I
like it ah so those are all the freaking
mascaras that I cannot wait to try she
sent me this cute little pair of stud
earrings which is awesome because I wear
studs of course I'm saying this and I'm
wearing like humongous hoops
I wear studs more than I wear anything
it's just what I end up wearing cuz it's
just simple you don't have to think
about it looks good with your hair up
down doesn't really matter
um and I just think they're just so
girly um and so these were so pretty I
think simple little things or it's the
little things I think it's target which
oh I love targets jewelry these are so
so cute I don't have anything like them
so I'm really excited they've got gold
and cream cannot wait to wear them okay
I'm trying to like keep everything out
so it's not like falling on me because
I'm sitting on my bed and everything's
like attacking me haha I don't even know
this is like Christmas opening this to
us you know not feeling okay behind I
feel like there's some of these things
that should like save for the end
because they're like out of this
freaking world okay she sent me to
Physicians Formula this is the pH
matchmaker powdered blush in the it's in
the natural shade and apparently it
lights up when you open it so I think
that's so fun and I think this would be
great to just have in your bag to be
able to like touch up and then you also
have a light in case you're like in the
car and it's nighttime I don't know so
cute and then she also sent me a think
it's another one but it's in the shade
oh it's a bronzer I didn't even connect
that and it also comes with a freaking
lipgloss with it bonus oh my gosh that's
awesome sorry the blush and the bronzer
and this one lights up as well this is
so cute so I'm so excited to
to try you guys I've been pretty good
once I realized that that the video was
lost I didn't open too many of these
things so you know what I mean like I so
some of them I did and I'll tell you
which ones I've already used and I might
even be wearing today
oops but ah so she sent me all these
Sonia Kashuk things and I have only
tried a few of her things and there's
not really um I don't know like I've
never I don't know I'm just really
excited about all of these things so she
sent me this chic luminosity bronzer and
blush duo so it's got both a blush and a
bronzer it's in the shade glisten and
her packaging is so cute that's what
Sonia Kashuk that is as well as amber
had all these things wrapped up so
adorably and everything like the nail
polishes she had like according to like
the color shape so like she had all the
like minty and green colors together and
all the like pink colors together and
all the like peach colors together so
cute okay so she sent me the
undetectable cream bronzer by Sonia
Kashuk and I have never used a cream
bronzer so I'm really excited to give
this one a try it could be awesome so
and then this one is another bronzer if
the illuminating bronzer in the shade
goddess and these have the coolest like
texture to them I can't wait to give
them a try and you know I haven't gotten
to try that many different bronzers so
I'm really excited to find ones that I
love and on the subject of bronzer is
the bronzer that again I teared up when
I opened because I've been wanting this
for so so long she sent me the hoola
bronzer and I left the packaging in it
but I've been using it like for four
days now and I'm wearing it today it
blends out so beautifully it's a matte
bronzer it's so expensive though and so
that's why I've never bought it and
amber is just so sweet um and she even
said she said you know I know your fair
skin but if you use it right it really
blends well it really works for any skin
tone and she's absolutely right like
this is absolutely gorgeous it works it
blends better than any bronzer I have
ever used oh my goodness like I feel
like when I run out of this I will be
sad but I will repurchase it because it
is incredible oh okay
so she also sent me this covergirl
instant cheekbones I think it has a
shade doesn't it maybe it maybe it
doesn't I don't know but it's instant
cheekbones so you've got like you can
use these as contour as blushes as
highlights I think that's the idea of it
like there's a highlight of blush and a
bronzer and these are nice it looks like
it would be good for my skin tone so I'm
excited to give these a try and again I
haven't tried very many covergirl
blushes or ron's or anything like that
so I'm excited about that one I'm trying
to kind of do these according to like
where you put them on the face you know
what I'm saying
okay she sent me backups of like three
backups of my covergirl simply ageless
it's the covergirl no lay I correct her
it's in 230 it's the one that's kind of
a yellow tone and I talk about all the
time and she's been paying attention
because she sent me freaking three of
these and she told me that she thinks
they were being discontinued and I think
they are too because I saw in a
drugstore close to me that like all of
them are on clearance I'm glad I didn't
buy any because she sent me three of
these although I still feel like I
should buy more like no that's like way
too many this is awesome so I'm gonna
have this for like so long and I'm so
excited because I really do use it
everyday I use it today
I use it every single day because I
haven't found another product that gives
me the look under my eyes like this one
does I freaking love it let me get all
those out of the way
okay I'm kind of done with the blushes
and bronzers I think unless another one
like pops up so I'm gonna go into the
lip products and I'm holding them just
in this makeup bag that I already own
but there are so many it's out of this
freaking world you have no idea like I
could not believe it
so she sent me this L'Oreal gloss and
it's in pink perseverance I've heard so
much about this and I'm so excited to
give it a try
uh-huh she's just so awesome she sent me
so many things that are like cult
favorites that I didn't own and she said
she was glad when I put up my um my
makeup collection video cuz she was able
to kind of see what I already own so she
didn't buy me doubles unless it was like
a favorite in which case she brought me
back up anyway so I'm so excited to give
that a try she sent me all of these
Sonia Kashuk lipsticks and oh my gosh
okay so there's vivid coral and they
have like a swatch on the bottom vivid
coral
nude pink which I am very excited about
that one rosette I love rosy colored
lips that's usually what I go for so
I'll probably love that another one
flashing which looks so pretty in the
swatch and then lastly I think unless
another one pops up classic red and this
is great because I really don't have a
red lipstick yet again my camera shut
off here we go okay so we just finished
with the Sonia Kashuk ones and okay so
she sent me oh my goodness so many
things she's sucking a ton of color
whispers which I could not have been
more excited about because I've only
tried one of them and I absolutely fell
in love with it like couldn't get enough
it was the lust for blush one and oh my
gosh it is so pretty so she sent me I
think four unless I find more in this
bag for more and okay so she sent me who
who wore it redder which is like this
red I could swatch these but it's gonna
take forever because there's so many so
she sent me who wore it redder petal
rebel which I've heard really good
things about which is like this kind of
light pink one and then she sent me
pinup peach also heard good things about
it this peach color if you can see that
and then she also sent me hola lilac
lilac that doesn't really work and it's
just like this really pretty like kind
of lilac II colored lipstick or I guess
color whisper I should say so excited to
try this out because I really love the
formula of those she also sent me a
bunch of um lip butter she sent me two
of my favorite lip butter peach parfait
because she knew I loved it and I had
run out and so she sent me two of them
which was so awesome it's my favorite if
you don't know that about me well then
you haven't been watching enough of my
videos now I'm just kidding it is one of
my favorites and then she says sweet
tart which is what I'm wearing on my
lips right now and I really really like
it's it's really nice pink if I it's
quickly becoming a new favorite of mine

like sealed shut so I'm not gonna worry
about opening right now

sorbet which I haven't tried yet I'm
really excited to try and actually I

I love NYX blushes in general so
hopefully I do love it

coral color and then she sent me a more
pink version which is called peony and I
am so excited to try these let me know

to apply these I have some ideas and I'm
gonna try out but I'm curious to know
what you guys could use to apply a
liquid blush but I'm trying to give this
a try because I've never had any
experience but that would be fun so she
also sent me well I'll do this one first
the okay I was really excited about this
and this is the Rimmel lasting finish
lipstick in airy-fairy this is another
cult classic people talk about all the
time it's just like a beautiful
neutrally pink color and I've heard that

heard that it wasn't and then I have
trouble finding it anywhere near me so
I'm so excited that she sent this to me
um then she also sent me this really
cute like goodie they called a purse
