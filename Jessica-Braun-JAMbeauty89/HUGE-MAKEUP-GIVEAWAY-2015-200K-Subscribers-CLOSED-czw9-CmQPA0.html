on here because I just saw that we hit
200,000 subscribers here on my channel
and I say we because it's not I mean yes
this is my channel but I feel like this
is something that you guys have helped
me build and along the past gosh two and
a half years since I started this you
guys have helped me learn so much about
myself and about my little quirks and
ticks and habits i have that i wanted to
break so you've given me plenty of
constructive criticism but you've also
helped encourage me along the way and
help build my confidence the fact that i
have 200,000 people that are willing to
hit the subscribe button and possibly
watch another video of mine is the most
heartwarming thing ever and you know
this isn't my main job I do teach like
I'm a fifth grade teacher so it's really
hard sometimes and every once a while
you know I get in these moods where I'm
like why am I even doing this like I
feel like it's so much more work on top
of what I'm already doing to teach that
I'm like why am I also doing YouTube but
then I just I'll go help on and wait
comments that you guys have written to
me and they're so sweet or I'll check my
fuel box and see these amazingly sweet
letters from you guys and I am so
flipping blessed and I just I can't I
can't go over at it so it fills me with
joy so much joy so I wanted to have on
here and say thank you from the bottom
of my heart I've already cried like so
much about this because it's so surreal
and I don't know if there will ever come
a point in my youtube career as I move
along where it won't feel surreal and I
just like just the other day I was in
target and a subscriber came up to me
and said I watch a YouTube channel and I
was like what like and I it hasn't
happened often than I've seen
subscribers but when it does it just
hits me like a ton of bricks I'm like oh
my gosh like I people like care about me
and watch my channel and would recognize
me in public it's weird and I don't
think
ever not be weird but it's amazing and
so I can't thank you guys enough I
wanted to do a giveaway we don't do them
very often on my channel but I figure
this is a great milestone to do so for
you guys I'll have all the info link for
you to enter many use rafflecopter if
you've ever used that for this giveaway
where it's just a little easier to enter
but down below I'll have exactly how you
can enter there will be more than one
way to enter so let's go into close-ups
of what you could possibly win again
thank you guys so much for following me
on this journey and if you've been with
me an original jammer since the
beginning thank you so much and it's
funny because there are some names that
I a lot of names and screen names I mean
that I recognize them I I know you and
everyone's well that person will say
like um I know you might not recognize
my name but I've been following you and
I'm like funny because I do I mean I
just kind of memorize the people that
comments all the time because I read
every single comment so thank you guys
for spending your time with me every
once a while when I'm doing all my
different videos and good luck on the
giveaway and i'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
