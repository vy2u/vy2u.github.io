humongous haul most of it is some of it
is stuff people like company sent me for
PR some from Paula's Choice like make up
the ball and sent me some things
what is this brand soap &amp;amp; Glory but it's
also a lot of things I bought from
Sephora kind of in preparation for my
wedding as I'm trying to figure out what
I want to wear on my freaking face eyes
I swear I will never make up my mind
until the day of and we'll just see what
happens I don't know so a lot of this is
kind of stuff that I bought even like a
month ago or even longer but I just
haven't really shown you so I just
figured I would kind of compiled as much
as I could remember and find in my
collection and show you there might be a
few things I've forgotten but that's
okay so a lot of this stuff if you are
interested in reviews of some of them
I've actually already filmed reviews and
they're to come but some of them I have
not so definitely let me know what
you're really interested in maybe if you
want swatch videos or reviews or demos
or all of the above let me know so let's
go ahead and get into it so I'd
mentioned that the balm sent me a bunch
of things I think I've gathered
everything they sent so one of the
things they sent me was they're nude
dude volume 2 cuz they they've had their
nude tude palette but this is the volume
towards the nude dudes but I've used
this just a little bit I just dip my
finger in it gross these are really I
almost feel like these are more wearable
colors than the original one what I love
the balm shadows aren't some of my
favorite in the world
I have loved their what is it called
they're like shady lady palettes I have
two of those and I that saw my first I
would consider them high-end
so my first high-end palettes I ever
ever ever bought and I loved them so I
always have a sweet spot in my heart for
the bomb this is no different these are
all really really pigmented and
beautiful and I like that they actually
have some matte colors like this is a
matte kind of light brown that I could
actually use in my crease for everyday
so I was really excited about that they
have one two three I would say four
that's kind of close almost five matte
shadows in here and then some nice
shimmery so they finally have found
balance because I feel like the original
one a lot of people just didn't use
because the colors I didn't love the
colors together I don't own it anymore
but anyway love this they also sent I'll
try and do all the BOM together this was
new to me this is called the bone desert
and it's their bronzer / blush I think
the most it would be a bronzer so it's
their packaging of course is so cute and
it's this really nice kind of light
bronzer when you swatch it it is a
little bit darker than you and I think
guess but it's a really nice color
definitely for me more of a summery
bronzer than like winter because I'm so
fair but if you were darker it's
beautiful really really pigmented you
definitely need a light hand but you can
find the bomb products a lot on
HauteLook which is where I always buy
them that's actually why my first
high-end palette was one from the bottom
because it was on HauteLook for like ten
dollars instead it's like 35 I was like
done up by so that's where I bought most
of my blushes from the balm they're
usually like ten dollars on HauteLook so
very cool
they also sent their insane blush you
guys are gonna laugh if you've seen my
makeup declutter video of my blushes I
you know went through and got rid of a
lot of blushes that just wasn't wearing
trying to downsize and simplify my life
and of course I say that and this is a
humongous haul anyway but this is in the
shade Argyle I had one in houndstooth
and I ended up decluttering that one
because it was just a little too dark
for my skin but this one actually looks
like a really nice pink shade which i
think would be really nice for my
skintone I didn't really give that a
fair swatch there we go just a really
nice light fresh color for spring slash
any time of year but spring I like that
so I'm pretty excited to give that a try
they also sent me one of their hot mama
blushes and I actually already owned
this so I passed one of these on to my
sister but I wanted to show you the one
I already had this really is an
absolutely beautiful peachy colored
blush just got that really pretty gold
shimmer to it oh my gosh it's there's a
reason this is like a cult classic in my
opinion it's very similar a little
peachy er than NARS orgasm blush but
this one is so beautiful and I think you
compare them they're comparable and that
one again is $10 a lot on HauteLook
so the bomb also sent me five I think of
their read my lips lip glosses and I'm
just gonna swatch a few of these some of
the more wearable colors this one's in
the shade BAM and these kind of have a
nice sweet scent and they're really
really opaque so and it's just got a doe
foot applicator that's such a pretty
color in my opinion really wearable they
also sent this more like I wanted to
swatch this one cuz I haven't watched it
yet it's in the shade snap and it's kind
of more of a brown nude again really
really pigmented which i think is nice
and opaque but yeah they all have that
same really fruity they almost feel like
fruit roll-ups if you know that smell
but definitely a brown shade but I think
that'd be really pretty in the fall
don't you guys but they also sent these
brighter colors as well this bright one
is in the shade zapped with two eggs
this one's in the shade pop I want to
swatch this one because it's like orange
and I want to see if it's that orange
it's not well I mean it is but this
one's a little more sheer you can see so
it's a wearable peach I think and then
they also have this really vampy one in
the shade Vava voom so that was from
them and let's see if there was anything
else from them oh they also sent their
Schwing
liquid eyeliner and this is just in
black and it's really really black I was
so pleasantly surprised I know a lot of
people swear by this they really really
like it and again you can get it pretty
cheap it is a really nice one it's got
the brush so it's not a felt tip it's an
actual thin brush but it's really nice
you can get a pretty precise line with
it it is really really this sounds dumb
to say but it's a really liquidy liquid
eyeliner if you use liquid eyeliner you
know what I mean
some of them are just more just not as
thick as others and this is a really
thin one but once it dries it's great I
do notice that this one smudges from
time to time especially here on my inner
corner like right there it will smudge
so this would not be one I'd wear like a
my wedding day or in the summer but I
think it's fine for everyday use
now Maybelline sent me I'm partnered
with stylehaul and everyone small
they'll give you like opportunities to
for a company to send you things so I
never spoken with Maybelline but I got
this sent to me and it's there the
blushed nudes palette and I haven't
tried they're just original nudes
palette but I've heard kind of mix
things but what I will say is they've
got a lot of really wearable colors in
this like again that really kind of
light brown color a decent amount of
kind of really shimmery and some that
are kind of an almost matte I was pretty
pleasantly surprised also watch a few of
these she didn't get an idea from what
I've heard this one is way more
pigmented than the original news so
there are three of the swatches they're
really pretty I've worn this I wore that
for like two weeks straight when I first
got it a couple weeks ago and I liked it
isn't my favorite palette in the whole
wide world no because I'm not big on
rosy colors on my eyes but is it a nice
palette yes and it's so inexpensive
I think the packaging is absolutely
gorgeous and you get twelve shades I
mean you can't really beat that so if
you've been kind of thinking about it I
would say give it a try all the colors
are nicely pigmented enough and they
blend pretty well that I think it's
worth it again through style haul
covergirl sent some things so I got the
super sizer mascara in very black I have
not tried this yet it's got a really
like a thin wand and it kind of bows out
and it's definitely like a synthetic
kind of plasticy one I'm intrigued to
try it I think it actually might be nice
like on your lower lashes because it
looks like it might be semi precise but
I will definitely do this try let me
know if you want to review and demo on
that one they also set the intensify me
lash blast liquid liner and this is in
intense black this is not waterproof I'm
going to open it I'm kind of hoping it
was because I definitely need waterproof
for my whoa so the tip is like a felt
like almost like a sponge and it's like
thin on one side and then it's like flat
as you turn it you guys see that I have
never seen do
really thick line whoa or you could turn
it and do a really thin line I can't
believe I've never heard of this also I
can't believe I've never seen a liquid
liner like that so love how you can get
different looks with that I might take
this on my honeymoon I'm gonna have to
try it out and see how it wears but very
cool I'm gonna be honest I am very
surprised that there's something new at
the freakin drugstore I feel like
everything is just a remake of something
someone else has made and maybe another
brand already does this but this is my
first time seeing it that is really
exciting I haven't been painting my
nails because I'm getting them done for
the wedding here soon anyway and so I
just don't feel like wasting the energy
you know I'm too busy so but I hate
looking down at them they just feel so
Nikki so just don't mind them so
polished choice they sent me a bunch of
skincare which I've already reviewed you
guys know if you have watched me for any
length of time how much I love Paula's
choice I swear by their skincare never
tried their makeup though so they sent a
few of these just to do with whatever I
wanted but I wanted to show them to you
guys cuz I haven't heard like anything
about their makeup on YouTube so the
first thing they sent is their nude
matte palette and it has got a lot of
colors look at look at this so many
amazing colors they're all like I said
matte except for there is one shimmery
shade right there
but these it comes with a brush which I
have not used it's just one sided a
synthetic brush can't get it out anyway
but also watch a few I'll swatch the
shimmery one and then kind of a mid-tone
one that I've been using a lot maybe a
deeper one so here's those three they're
very powdery I will say that they are
very you know you kind of gotta tap your
brush off but they're not the darker
colors aren't that dark let me try and
get one more dark one to see maybe it is
cuz I don't use them often enough yeah
like this is the dark brown so are they
crazy buttery pigmented no but I think
if you're just kind of an everyday
person and you don't want a crazy dark
deep color but you still want to kind of
achieve that blended look with those
kinds of colors this is a great palette
that I would assume because it's
polished choice that would have to be
good for your skin as well which i think
is pretty cool but what I will say is
really pigmented is this next thing they
sent which is their blush it on contour
palette and it's less of a contour
palette more of a blush palette with a
contour shade but the lady when I was
talking to her on the phone we even told
me she said these are very very
pigmented you have to use light and I'm
like okay so it's got four different
blush shades and then a contour shade
and like a shimmery highlight shade so
there are those - there's the contour it
is more of an orange almost more of a
bronzer than a contour in my opinion but
the highlight is really nice I've used
that I didn't use it today but I've used
it quite a bit and it is a really nice
it blends well where you don't feel like
it's a shriek on your face but the
blushes are very pigmented as well
they're so so beautiful they of course
they all look the same on here and they
are pretty close I just watched these
three let's try the more orangie peachy
one yeah that one's a lot brighter so
they're all really similar shades but
again I would have to assume these are
good for your skin at least to a certain
degree because of what Paula's Choice
stands for like their whole brand is all
about this so if you don't know what I'm
talking about you're like what does
polished choice I will link that video
below because they're amazing so I
placed an order well i placed like a
thousand different separate orders on
sephora and some of this I bought on
birch box's website because they'll have
deals where if you spend you know twenty
five dollars on a brand you get this
free gift so I kind of it's and some
from Nordstrom you'll see what I mean so
I bought this thinking I'll probably
wear for my wedding I'm wearing this
today this is the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation you guys know I'm all about
drugstore and eye but if you've ever
done your own makeup for your wedding
you know that as you get close you're
getting more and more nervous oh my god
I'll just spend the money and get what
everyone else says is really good
because you're nervous like I am so
nervous so I ended up buying this just
in case cuz I was like well I think I'm
gonna use my Rimmel lasting finish one
that I love
or maybe I'll use my Revlon color
wit but then everyone online says this
is the best for weddings and for
photography so I'm like well then maybe
I'll buy it so I'm wearing it today I
really do like the way it looks I don't
feel like it's that as long wearing as
people say though because throughout the
day as I've worn this this week like I
noticed not breaking up but lots of oil
breaking through in my nose like redness
comes through within a few hours so I'm
playing with a few things to help with
that but I do like it so far a lot and
it's got a pump and you can actually
control how much comes out of the pump
but regardless this is what I'm trying
out right now and it is really nice I
also bought in preparation for the
wedding this Ben Nye final seal spray
and it's a matte makeup sealer a lot of
people swear by it I've got tons of
setting sprays but I wanted something
that was almost like hairspray for my
face and this really is and if you've
ever used it smells like mint I don't
think it's great for your skin to use
every single day it hasn't made me break
out but I just have a feeling I think
there's out yeah there's definitely
alcohol in it I wouldn't use it every
day but for special events I think it's
great what I've noticed when I've used
it is that my makeup does not move my
eyeshadow my anything I mean you have to
still I still have to set my foundation
every once a while because I'll start to
get a little bit oily in my t-zone but
beyond that like my blush will stay my
contour will say I am very excited that
I bought this it's not that expensive
for this small bottle and it's awesome I
also got from Nordstrom this Mac pigment
in vanilla and they now sell these like
pigment to goes and they're so cute it's
still like a little yeah I think it's a
little tiny glass jar I don't know how
many ounces it is it's 2.5 grams or
point zero nine ounces but it's just
enough because a pigment if you're like
me you're not gonna go through oh my
gosh ever in a million years the regular
size but it's just a really pretty kind
of golden a white color and I've seen a
lot of people use it on their wedding
day on their lid so I bought it in
preparation I think this size was like
10 bucks and on Nordstrom I always use
Ebates first because I get cash back but
then
Nordstrom you get
shipping no matter how small of an order
you're placing so I was able to get this
just for $10 straight up so that was
nice okay
I also these so many things I bought
this Urban Decay revolution lipstick and
native because I might wear it on my
wedding it's this really beautiful cool
toned pink and these I love the formula
I can't believe it's taken me this long
to buy one now I'm like well now I want
every single shade they own they sell
they don't own a well I guess they do
anyway
it's so pretty isn't it and it's a
really really creamy formula the
packaging is really hefty and feels so
well made oh my gosh I love pulling this
out using it because I just I just feel
pretty using it but it's a really creamy
formula it just feels comfortable on
your lips and it's really like pigmented
so I was pleasantly surprised don't like
that these are like eighteen or twenty
dollars but might buy another shade
eventually because I was so impressed I
have to admit and you guys know that's
the killer you guys know I love
drugstore makeup but I mean sometimes
guys you just got a splurge and that is
amazing I also got a Smashbox lipstick
on Birchbox website I actually okay Shh
I bought one of these in this shade for
all my bridesmaids because it's such a
wearable color for everyone in these
Smashbox lipsticks lipsticks are amazing
it's in the shade Primrose this is their
be legendary lipstick in the shade
Primrose and like I said we all have
this now well they will don't tell I
hope they're not watching it's just such
a pretty everyday rosy pink color and
it's not too cool or not too warm I
thought it was kind of right in between
and the packaging is so nice and sleek
and these really do last a long time in
your lips I mean you have to reapply
them after a little while like most
lipsticks but I was so pleasantly
surprised I'm excited for them to open
them I think they will really really
like these I also got another of my
brows from Anastacio in medium brown
this is like the fifth one I've had
because I know that the one I have I'm
running low on and we'll be on our
honeymoon
like three weeks and I didn't want to
run out while in Europe I don't know if
Anasazi products are sold in Europe are
they let me know I don't know
regardless I bought a backup and I
figure I'll just bring this full-size
the brand new one with me that way I
don't have to bring two and run out I'll
just bring this one that way I know I
will run out but I love them they've got
this fully on one side and just the
skinny pencil on the other it's the
perfect shade for me I just keep buying
it over and over again so I was glad to
have it back up and I also bought
another of my favorite lip balm in the
whole wide world and it's the seal Big
Love my favorite night balm and you guys
this stuff is amazing
I don't wear just a night I wear in the
morning when I'm getting ready I wear it
at night I put it on throughout the day
it's this really nice vanilla smell it
just moisturize my lips like crazy I
love it so much so oh I got this from
Haute look it's an urban decay lip
pencil it's from the Bourbon Nona
Arbonne decay the pulp fiction line that
they came out with I have no idea when
but it's in the shade mrs. Mia Wallace
and it's just one of their lip pencils
and it's just a really nice berry red
and I was so excited about that so and I
have not really had a lot of experience
with their glide-on lip pencils and on
on hope this was like I want to say like
six dollars I was like duh
so I was pretty excited to get that and
give it a try now a lot of this other
stuff were free samples either from
Nordstrom or for Sephora
so I've got well this was the birthday
gift you get this year it's these two
NARS lip pencils I could not believe it
so this first ones in Cruella and it's
more of like a red again in kind of AHA
such a that's it right there
so that was exciting and then I also got
this one that no one can pronounce
rikugien rikugien
I don't know and it's just a really kind
of more shimmery this one was matte this
one's more shimmery and like a light
pink so very excited to try these out
because NARS is not something I buy
myself virtually ever so very cool then
I also got this was like ten or twelve
dollars it's a mini bite Beauty
double-ended lipstick and it's in the
shade
and date and I wanted to get it because
I needed to get like 250 dollars to get
the free shipping on Sephora and so I
only need to spend like ten or twelve
more dollars and I've been dying to try
to buy products so this one's in the
shade date these are so creamy and it's
just a really really pretty neutral
color and these really are tiny when I
got it I laughs I'm like okay these are
like smaller than anything but I'm like
hey and then this one's in this shade
fig and it's just a little more pink but
there's still paint yet creamy and from
what I understand by Beauty only uses
like food grade ingredients so it's
really good for you like it's not bad
for you at all these kind of have a no I
don't think these really have a smell at
all I think I'm smelling what was on my
hands before so love these two colors so
wearable the other duo they had I feel
like for me weren't wearable shades but
these both are really wearable so that
was a great $10 purchase I also got some
samples this is the bare minerals
original foundation and fairly light I
haven't tried it I'm not gonna open it
yet because I I'm it really only comes
with a little bit like if you shake you
to the side there's like a tiny baby
amount I've used these before but I had
it in
I think light and it was too dark so I
have a feeling fairly light will be a
better match
I also got the Lancome excessive black
well that's the shade Hypnose drama
mascara I don't want to open and get air
into it yet cuz I want to use it for
real and let you guys know I think I've
used Hypnose drama before and I liked it
it wasn't my favorite but I think I did
like it so i'ma let you know and then
this I have used this was a Mac sample
when I bought the Mac pigment from
Nordstrom so this is the Mac prep and
prime skin and I don't think it's a
shade I think it's just like a
translucent it comes out white like a
you know kind of like a white lotion and
you know you just blend it in it's yeah
it's got that silicone feel to where
it's really almost slippery but it's
nice I've been using it all over my face
before putting foundation on and I don't
think it's the best primer I've ever
used but it's a little bit more
moisturizing than the one
I have used and my skin can get really
dry especially on my nose so I think
it's pretty good for that but I would
say get a sample and try it out before
you go and buy the whole thing because
primers are so I mean someone could love
a primer and then on the next person it
looks terrible so it really depends on
your skin I also got some makeup
products from soap &amp;amp; Glory this is their
pillow pillow plump sexy mother pucker
so it's just like a you know a squeezy
tube gloss it's just shimmery it's got a
it smells like that fake chocolate smell
which I know a lot of people don't like
I don't really mind it too much I think
if I smelled it all the time I'm get
tired of it it does have that smell and
from what I understand this is supposed
to be a plumper so it's supposed to buzz
tingles zing your lips that's that was
their words not mine and then the other
thing they sent was like a lip pencil I
haven't even opened this yet it's in the
shade nudist and so yeah it's just a
pencil it's it's another sexy mother
pucker gloss stick 3d volume lip shine
and like I said it's in the shade nudist
wrong spot it is just like a really nude
color it's right there that's actually
pretty nice and it does have a nice
shine to it this one just has a sweet
vanilla smell so that's nice I'll show
you a few other things that I got
because they I actually got him a long
time ago and I never showed him in a
haul cuz I'm gonna show everything I get
in a home I know a lot of people are
like crazy about that but I don't know I
know I figured you'll see it when I
review it or whatever so it's not that
big of a deal some people like lose
their minds about it anyway I also got
some bentonite powders and these I have
a review films of these I'll have up
soon this is in cameo and I use it to
set my under eye quite often and it's
really nice I might wear this is that my
under eye on my wedding I also got
banana which is a lot more yellow which
I don't use this often it's not as
brightening if you had a darker skin
tone it would be though
so I that review will be coming who I'm
getting it everywhere and I also got the
NARS sheer glow foundation and I bought
a pump that they sell online this isn't
the shade OB and it's actually a good
match for me
but this really is a lot more sheer than
I thought and I know you know what the
name sheer glow I should have thought
about it but it almost doesn't have
enough coverage for me I have only worn
it like twice so I need to give it like
a million more tries before I just make
my opinion about it but that's so far
what I'm experiencing so just so you
know so that is my ridiculously long
haul let me know what you would like me
to review below I will definitely link
my playlist of all the hauls I've done
Dollar Tree hauls and other support
hauls times of drugstore hauls I know
this was a lot of high-end stuff which I
don't typically do but I figured I would
kind of show it all to you in one fell
swoop so if you enjoyed please subscribe
and I'll catch you guys in my next video
