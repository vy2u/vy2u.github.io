well it's kind of a peel box on opening
but it's all Mary Kay stuff and I know
this because I've been talking to this
girl
kingi on I think it was through Twitter
that we were corresponding and she sells
Mary Kay and she wanted to send me some
goodies because really and I think I
mentioned this in a few videos before
I've always been interested in Mary Kay
products but I really never tried them I
remember when I was younger my mom used
Mary Kay products and she had friends
that sold it and I remember trying it
then and thinking it was really nice but
I mean I was so much younger I didn't
really wear makeup so I'm really excited
now as an adult to give it a try and see
how I like it I think it'll be helpful
for you guys too because you probably
have friends or know someone that sells
Mary Kay and you're always like maybe
but you don't hear about it much so you
don't really know if it's worth spending
your money on or not so that being said
I'm really really excited to see what
she sent me and I'm really excited to
try it out and review these products for
you guys and I think what I'll do is
this will just be showing you what I
have and then if there's any specific
products that you're really curious
about me reviewing let me know down
below or I might just do kind of an
overall review of this stuff here in
like a month or so after I've gotten to
try all of it and get an idea of how I
like each product and then go through
them and review them in a separate video
so let me know what you'd be interested
in but I'm already excited she sent me
in a box and on the top I I can show you
some of it without trying to show my
dress but there's like little Minnie
Mouse dizzy okay let's go ahead and tear
right in okay so okay nicely pink so
she's got the Mary Kay
you know magazine or catalog whatever
you would call it all kinds of things
I'm excited to look at that it looks
like they've really kind of revamped
their design and kind of made it more
modern I think it's got a wrap for being
a little old school but it looks oh my
gosh okay
oh my gosh there are Mickey's all over
everything even the letter O my cat's
eye I want to like make magnets out of
all of these I like actually might do
that these are adorable where did you
get these Katie and the card oh oh this
makes my heart happy first of all its
Mickey Mouse and it's because I
graduated that makes me that's just so
sweet that you were thoughtful enough to
write I don't know but it just makes my
heart very happy yes I did just graduate
and if you follow me on Instagram or
Twitter I've been posting pictures you
know like when I at my graduation and
things and that was just so thoughtful
thank you
oh and she also gave me a gift
certificate for fifty dollars in free
Mary Kay products okay let me read this
No Oh Katie thank you for this card I
will cherish this and I hope you guys
know any letters I ever receive from you
guys I keep and I have a special box for
them and I write everyone back in fact I
just sent a bunch of letters out today
to subscribers that have written me and
sent me things and stuff anyway okay oh
my gosh I'm so excited
okay oh my gosh look at all this stuff
oh hello wasn't wrinkled she said that
she sent me her favorites which is
always exciting to me because that that
helps me know that I'm probably gonna
love them if someone else out there
loves them especially you Katie you know
about all these products I'm just so
excited this one says this finishes your
look and it will keep you flawless -
Marnie excited there's Mickey's on all
of these I'm literally gonna save all of
those though for magnets Shelly oh this
is the Mary Kay makeup finishing spray
and I hate how this is so and it's my
skin today via skin it Wow Mary Kay
makeup finishing spray by Scandinavia
Scandinavia is so smart they're like
getting their name in on every brand -
even though they're at their own this is
so sleek looking I love the packaging
well I might as well try it right
ah
it feels good it kind of has that in the
Navy Osprey smell if you know what I
think that is awesome and the fact that
it's made by Scandinavia makes me like
know that I'm gonna love it
so very excited about this oh my gosh
okay I'm gonna try and keep like trash
on one side okay stay organized this one
says one of our best sellers perfect for
a hands-on teacher but this oh oh yeah
it's got a lot of stuff in it
so this little baggie comes with three
goodies in it and it's got the satin
hands Oh fragrance free hand softeners
the hand cream and the hand scrub so
it's three separate products here this
is this is great and I'm actually I have
never in my life tried a hand scrub and
so this is gonna be really cool just to
see how it makes my hands feel I've
never done that so that's really nice so
exciting okay this one is just a lonely
little one unless it fell out of
something I'm not sure it is the creamy
lip color oh yeah this is in the shade
carefree Coral oh I'm already gonna love
it
interesting packaging this is so funny
because like this is such a pretty color
and I would never guess Mary Kay would
be doing like fun colors like this so oh
yeah and I'm not over how adorable this
packaging is are you guys seeing this
this bone I have butter fingers today
butter fingers Magoo next that I see and
with Mickey Mouse on it says this is
limited edition okay but it's gorgeous
well I can already tell that the
packaging I wonder if this one is too
because they both have similar packaging
I'm still not over that color it is so
pretty
okay break into this sucker
it is a nail lacquer who have never
tried their nail I have tried like
anything from them ooh how much fun is
that gonna be this is totally something
I would wear like on my toes
um toes what color is this this is
called also in carefree quarrel so
that's like I see they go together let's
get together yeah yeah okay that's
awesome
all right next I use these I hate their
eyeshadow I'm sorry I'm just
brain farted I shout a face or you can
elute use them alone okay they don't
budge she says oh there's more than one
thing in here oh my gosh you guys this
feels like Christmas okay
Oh tell me these are cream eyeshadows
these are all cream eyeshadows I am so
excited so all four of these cream
eyeshadows there's four of them here i
swatched them all here look how
beautiful these are and like she said
they don't budge so I cannot wait to
give these a try and oh my gosh oh my
gosh so the next item here and she just
wrote liquid gold hmm
oil free eye makeup remover oh my gosh I
haven't been using eye makeup remover oh
yeah it's the kind it looks like it's a
kind of separate to you you shake it up
you guys know what I mean
I am excited though because I have been
using cleansing oil to remove my eye
makeup and it works but sometimes if
I've worn anything waterproof it's not
perfect at getting all of it off so I
really should be using an eye makeup
remover so this is going to be awesome
the next one says driftwood is a perfect
crease color and your compact makes it
easy to travel with okay so the compact
that it comes with it looks like this
it's kind of hard it said yeah you can
kind of see it says mary kay there at
the bottom really kind of sleek looking
and it looks like there's more than one
spot for things we're going to see so
she also sent with that
um oh yeah mineral eye colors this one
is driftwood hi
that is what number three of things that
I've dropped okay yeah this is the
perfect crease color look at that that
is the perfect crease color okay that's
it aside and now that when she sent is
rose gold oh yeah oh my gosh this one is
so pretty
isn't that gorgeous and then the next
one she sent was French Roast there's
like yes I was gonna say it sounds like
it'd be like a dark brown so those go in
this compact here and I'm gonna look up
exactly how they fit in their best you
know what I mean like there's a certain
this is awesome though it looks like
it's magnetic and these are too so yeah
this is awesome
actually maybe I'll do it three by three
these three colors are gonna be perfect
together really they just magnetized in
there oh my gosh these colors are
gorgeous
okay sorry if I itch my nose lots cuz
I'm going through allergy season and
okay Oh what else jeez Louise this one
does not have a note on it a lot let's
see yeah this is their ultimate mascara
in black awesome just classic packaging
you know just a sleek design love that
it doesn't say it's waterproof which is
good because I don't I don't usually
wear waterproof they don't really bother
me I just don't usually this is an eye
primer it says this is great if you'll
do like my whole face with this stuff
yep just classic packaging let's see if
it's like a squeezy tube I'm assuming it
is yep which is great because the wand
ones you know that type they always you
can never get everything out of there
and it's just never quite right you know
so there's that in the trash pile this
one does have a note says your lips are
the only thing that does not exfoliate
itself that makes sense I've never
thought about that
like our skin will kind of slough off
like its own dry skin as you get you
know but your lips don't do it
themselves that is a really interesting
thought so this is the satin lips lip
balm and lip mask so let's see I am
really excited I did not take care of my
lips as well as I should I think so yeah
the lip balm is just a I can't get it
open
squeezy tube type which is great just
dandy and then the lip mask which I've
never used a lip mask it looks just the
same but I'm assuming it says gently
apply to lips leave on for one to two
minutes and then remove this is awesome
oh my goodness there's so much you guys
oh my gosh
ok so this these are well decorated so
heute says the second step to the basic
set the basic set will last you for
months
oh here's the hold on here's the first
step I should probably do that first
step to the basic set used before the
moisturizer so all of them at once first
okay so this is a three-in-one cleanser
and this is step 1 for normal to dry
skin looks like this the three-in-one
jet cleanser gently clears away
impurities as it begins to prep the
process to erase the visible signs of
aging and restore the look of younger
looking skin sounds awesome sounds
awesome so that was step one that's
awesome so then step two is this it's
the age fighting moisturizer that makes
sense so excited okay with this one this
one says my holy grail lotion you will
love it okay there we go
oh so this is time wash body targeted
action toning lotion dry to oily skin
will give your skin a body boost its
4-minute to read of redefined body
contours by toning firming and smoothing
your entire shape and just once that
blue oh I love that it has a pump I love
that it has a pump this is awesome okay
I can't wait to use this stuff you guys
I'm just gonna tear into this stuff
this videos over okay next one
microdermabrasion only used twice a week
okay this is awesome
wow it's like legit this is like a hard
box so nice so it's two steps step one
is refine and let's see what it says so
well I'll show you what it looks like up
close there so it is two steps it's this
is step one here and it says after
cleansing apply a quarter sized amount
of the of this to wet face with your
fingertips rinse thoroughly with warm
water pat dry and then step two let's
see if it actually says what to do with
it doesn't say on there but it step two
is replenish so I'm assuming it's like a
serum or something like that so this is
adorable
this will be getting some good use from
me that is for sure okay last thing oh
my gosh so much stuff she was so much
better and cheaper than the Clarisonic
my holy grail okay
I am so excited
it is a one of those personal you know
cleansing brushes that you use I am so
excited because I have been thinking
about getting the Clarisonic or a
similar product and like it's so much
money I'm like there's no way there
aren't better or at least the same
versions out there that are cheaper
because it's stupid expensive Katie you
just rocked my world and if this is
awesome in it so much cheaper that's
gonna be great for you guys so if you
guys are looking for something more
inexpensive I'll let you know how I feel
about this I'm sure I'll like it I mean
honestly this is so awesome oh my gosh
so wow that was a lot of stuff I will be
linking Katie's information if you're
interested in buying any of this stuff
from her down below and like I said I
will be doing some sort of review video
on all of these products here within the
next month or so after I've gotten to
try all of them so I'll be sure to let
you guys know which ones I loved which
ones you know just kind of how I felt
about all of them to help you guys out

things and maybe trying out some mary
