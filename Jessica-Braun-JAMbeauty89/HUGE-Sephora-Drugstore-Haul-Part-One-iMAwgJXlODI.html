have to split this into two parts
because I have a lot of things in front
of me that I got from Sephora and then I
also got from the drugstore and then I
also have like the November epsy bag
that I just recently got and then also
an influenster voxbox which was full of
some products as well I'm gonna put
those in a part two video right now
we'll focus on the Sephora and the
drugstore stuff that I got okay
Sephora will start with I got I had a
$50 gift card and I also had a 20% off
code for my friend amber so I got the
Too Faced beauty blogger darlings and if
you have twenty dollars to spend I'm
serious if you twenty dollars to spend
and you're wanting to try out some
higher-end products and you're not sure
where to start this is a good one it has
four different products they're all like
deluxe sizes the main reason I got it is
cuz I wanted to try the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer and this is a
smaller one of it but I mean frankly I
don't go through bronze that quick so
this is probably gonna last me forever
it smells like chocolate it is a really
nice matte bronzer that you can kind of
see it there it looks nice with light
fair skin which surprised me it would
look great on deeper skin tones for sure
but it actually looks nice if you're
fair as well especially for like contour
so I love it and I love the way it
smells that came with the Too Faced
better than sex mascara the name these
names kill me but I don't know how it is
because I don't want to open it yet
because I'm not quite ready to like move
on to next a new mascara so but it also
came with the Too Faced shadow insurance
and the Too Faced primed and poreless
pretty nice sizes especially for the
shadow primer this I tried and I really
like this I'm not really sure how I feel
about it yet so I need to use it some
more to determine how I feel about it as
a face primer I also finally gave it and
bought the Naked basics palette and I
had held off for so long I'm buying this
cuz I felt that these three shadows here
were all so similar I was like why am I
gonna spend that much money on a palette
where three of the six shadows are all
like the same but even and even as you
swatch it they still look pretty darn
similar
however I will say this I've basically
I've realized I have a use for every
single shadow on this pallet this I use
for like a brow bone highlight this I
use as a lid color this I use to blend
this I use in the crease this outer
corner and then this for like liner if I
want to like set my liner with the
powder so this is perfect to travel with
because every single shadow has a use
for me which is rare I don't think I
have a single other palette where I use
every single shadow so I was pleasantly
surprised the packaging is sleek it's
great for travel worth it especially if
you have a 20% off code which you know
you can get those every once in a while
okay big deal alert Dollar Tree has a
ton of Milani products right now
including it came in packaging like this
the Milani liquify pencils which are
like the creamiest pencil eyeliners this
one is in green which I actually have a
swatch already because I tried to film
it already
there's the green one and then I also
have brown which is this deep deep
chocolate brown the green one was
retractable the brown home was the
sharpener but it is the same liquify
pencil so I thought that was interesting
but I will say the one the pencil one
where you have to sharpen is a little
bit creamier than the retractable one
however these products are amazing and
they were only a dollar I could not get
over that okay so oh I've got coffee
everywhere look at my cute mug and it
says goodwill to all there I got it for
like $3 at Big Lots makes me so happy
okay by the way if you guys got the
peppermint mocha creamer that's out in
the stores right now every year I get it
and every year that just I don't have it
my coffee right now actually but um I
just love it cuz it has such like happy
wintery Christmassy memories like that
taste does so every time I get it for
the first time that year I'm just like
oh anyway okay so at the drugstore I've
bought a lot of stuff one thing that I
got my friend amber told me she's been
loving is the Rimmel match perfection
foundation I have it in the lightest
shade which is 101 classic ivory this is
really nice if you have dry skin and I
would say if you have combo skin prime
it
with some sort of primer and then also
set it with powder and you'll like it
if you have oily skin I think you should
say away I don't think you'll like it
it's only like five or six bucks
depending on where you go and if you
have a coupon even better I really like
it and I think it's just such a nice
almost like dewy look on your skin I
have noticed that I usually have to set
it like one more time like halfway
through the day so I don't love that
about it but for the price this is a
nice foundation so I would recommend it
I also got okay I had a coupon who's a
$2.00 off Walgreens coupon for Revlon
lip and then I also had a $2.00 off
manufacturer and I had three of each and
then Revlon was 40% off I got these bomb
stains for like 75 cents each isn't that
awesome
so I got one just from the regular line
which was in cherish which it's right
here on the end it's such a pretty like
Barbie pink color and then one that's an
everyday color it's one of their new
lacquer bombs so they're a little bit
more almost glossy it's in the shade de
Muir and it's definitely an everyday
very wearable color it's right there um
I really really like this one I have a
feeling that'll be one that's just gonna
become a staple in my purse because it's
just so easy for the day to day and then
the one I'm wearing now is definitely a
different color for me and I'm sure half
of you will love it happy you will hate
it maybe some in between I think I like
it I I know I never wear colors like
this so I'm trying to just kind of
branch out for fun this one's in the
shade whimsical and these the thing
about these lacquer bombs is that they
do have glitter in them it's right there
um which at first I was like I don't
know but I've had this on for about an
hour now and it's wearing off fine and
it doesn't look overly glittery at all
so I kind of like it I don't really mind
the glitter which is surprising me okay
another thing that I got this was $3 on
clearance at Walgreens so check them out
as soon as you can this is the Revlon
Photoready what do they called this
sculpting blush palette I have it in the
shade pink rose and it comes with a
little brush that's already falling out
but it's really pink color pretty pink
color and then a bronzer and a highlight
shade and they don't look that pigmented
right here and I knew that because when
I got home I looked and swosh them and I
was like what but then I thought you
don't want them you don't always want a
pigmented blush because I end up dipping
it in there's way too much powder on it
blush powder and I had to shake half of
it off wipe some of it off then put it
on then I go that's too much then I got
a like you know help get rid of it I'm
like this makes it so much easier and
when I applied this it was beautiful
all three of them beautiful together my
mom even said I saw her later that day
and she said what do you have on your
cheeks and I ain't told her and she said
it looks so natural and just like glowy
I was like thanks there was three
dollars it's like a dollar per thing the
only gripe I have about it is I wish the
bronzer and the highlight color were
either bigger pants or farther away
because it's hard to dip your brush in
them without getting it in the other so
three dollars I want to go back and get
the other shades that they had okay two
more things I what Maybelline had buy
one get one half off you know as usual
and then I had coupons so I forgot about
this an old favorite the Maybelline
Dream Lumi concealer you just twist it
it goes up into the brush I usually put
it here and then here's what's magical
about this product you can just touch it
and it melts into your skin you don't
have to blend it you don't need a Beauty
Blender you don't need a brush you don't
need anything but your finger because
frankly that's how its best apply with
your finger and it is just such a
beautiful bright color I love it and
then this I also repurchase it's the
instant age rewind in the brightener
shade and this one did I say is in
radiant I don't know if I said the shade
name this one I love it's a very similar
effect it goes into the the little
sponge here you do it the same place it
blends in best with your fingers I will
say though out of these two I like this
one that Dream Lumi the best it just
it's unbelievable they both wear all day
you don't really have to set them I
usually do setup with the powder just
cuz I do but I don't think you really
need to these are amazing amazing
products and I've repurchase these each
at least once so and I'll probably
repurchase them again so I really really
like them that will be all for this part
part 1 of the haul stay tuned for part 2
which should be up either later after
this video or soon after
um in which I'll feature the Ipsy bag
from this month and also the influenster
voxbox so I hope you enjoyed and that
this is fun you maybe learned about some
good deals that are around us right now
and I will catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
