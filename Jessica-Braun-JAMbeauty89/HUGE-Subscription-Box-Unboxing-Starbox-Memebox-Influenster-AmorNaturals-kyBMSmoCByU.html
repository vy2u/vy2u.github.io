video so I always do my boxycharm versus
Ipsy but then all the other subscription
boxes that I get I usually do in this
one so usually it includes a mini box of
some sort in a star box and then this
time I also have like a soap box called
it's from a company called a more
natural and then I also have an
influencer box spot so it's all
explained here in a second so let's do
good the first thing star box
accidentally and I I say it as an accent
because they send me these for free to
review so I always show them and
sometimes I love them sometimes I don't
it's just kind of the way it is but
these are 15 dollars a month and they
accidentally sent me two completely
separately so I'm gonna give one away to
you guys obviously because what am I
gonna do with two of these I will put
the info on how to enter below it'll be
really really easy so let's see what's
in the star box this month this is for
August actually sorry okay it was
obvious 2014 dollhouse was the thing
okay sorry think of all kinds of cars so
what did you hear this month first thing
I see is this precision eyeliner what
color is it
let's see shall we it looks oh it looks
like it must be like a liquid kind and
it's in black perfect so it's one of
those let's see what kind of brush whoa
a lot of liner it's like a felt tip
brush really pretty firm ooh really
black though I don't know if that's
coming across but it's really really
black and it seems like there's a lot of
control so I'm actually really excited
about this I will use this cuz I usually
use liquid liner of some sort on my eyes
so yeah and it's black thank you for
doing a normal color and there's only
one of the thing in this one this month
oh it's a blush palette though a3 shade
blush palette let's see if I can open it
these boxes are so don't my way okay so
it's feels really like hefty these are
beautiful fall colors oh my gosh I
almost bought a blush today at the store
I'm glad I didn't I'm real
excited about this one here it's kinda
like a like a mauve color and then like
a bronzer and then like a more peachy
these are gorgeous it just says it's 3b
- there's no like name for this palette
but oh my gosh
so one of you guys will win those two
items that was the small I'm assuming
there were only two items and there
usually there's at least three or four
but I'm assuming because there is a big
blush palette in there that's why they
only gave us but these are both so
useful to me I would almost rather just
get two items that are really really
useful like a black eyeliner and a blush
palette instead of like a gold eyeshadow
and a gold or like a yellow cream shadow
you know things like that I'd rather get
stuff like that so I really like to even
though it's like to think so here's the
other one I will leave packaged up and
Purdy for someone to win yay okay the
next thing I'm going to show is this is
the soap box that I was telling you guys
about I'll put the price for this box
down below I don't know it off the top
of my head but it's a more natural ziz
the company and they let's see oh it's
got a lot of stuff in it but it's based
on a Midsummer Night's Dream which is
the William Shakespeare play in case you
didn't know I'm excited to see I've
never got all of these are all so cute
look look at all the cute little things
in there it smells so good
alright so in here we've got a bath is
lavender macaron
and it's like sparkly almost this is
amazing
oh it smells so good - the next thing in
here is this almond milk artisan soap
ooh mmm that smells nice - just a cute
little soap the next thing a Jasmine
musk Body Lotion just real small you
know it would be good for travel I know
that the next thing is a foot butter and
coconut mint I'm gonna smell that
coconut mint oh it's sealed
I got enough
I don't know how to describe the set
they nails it with the name coconut
mince you can smell the mint but you can
smell the coconut I know I'm being so
real with you guys when I say I've never
smelled anything like this it smells
amazing so it's a foot butter oh it
feels so creamy I wish you guys could
smell it these are all so adorable okay
there are two more things in here the
next one is a brown sugar scrub and
cacao vanilla and yes it is spelled like
the way you know cacao
you know from if you saw the other video
another okay oh it's sealed - oh that
smells really really good and it's just
a really sugary thick scrub love those
good hey you know these are smaller
which i think is adorable but for
travelling like if you did want to bring
a little scrub cuz they don't really
sell travel-size scrubs usually this
would be perfect
the last thing in here is this
grapefruit peppermint is it a lip balm
it doesn't say let me see on the card
what it says it is lip balm stopping
your lip ease at the touch of natural
peppermint and summer grapefruit ooh see
again oh it smells good it's such an
interesting mix of sense I still am not
over the coconut mint that is amazing
that is just amazing so that's what was
in that that is actually really cute I
think it says that there's a fall box
that'll be shipping out October 1st is
when you can get that one so like I said
I'll put the link below but thank you
for sending this to me I'm really
excited to try these out because I've
never this is the first kind of like
soap box I've ever gotten I really like
it I'm just adorable
the next box is my mini box but this one
is let's see what theme it is cuz they
have all the different boxes and these
are a little more pricey these are like
in the 20s range some most of them I
think are either 21 or 27 again I'll put
all this info below this is super box
number 41 my cute wish list okay it does
look adorable I'm pretty excited let's
peek in together shall we okay now I get
why it's called my cute wish list so
what are these things though like these
are like these
really odd squishy things says point
paths what does that mean okay it's
enriched with vitamin E collagen
hyaluronic acid blah blah blah it um
what do you do with it stick the point
pad on areas of your face in neat that
are in need of concentrated care rest
for five to ten minutes and then remove
it and Pat the remaining essence onto
your skin there like squishy and kind of
moist so oh oh there's a bunch of them
oh I thought it was one big squishy Pat
but there's like ten actual thin pads in
here so I guess it's for moisturization
on certain areas right it might be nice
to just sick these on your eyes since
it's got like vitamin E and collagen and
stuff that might just be nice and just
sick so that's probably how I'll use
them yeah okay next thing is what is
this Snow White
look it's like a punk rock Snow White of
course I don't know what it says what is
the actual three Beauty people Snow
White special edition edition season 2
what is it I'm already excited it says
Jo liner pencil okay it's in its own tin
let me open you okay Oh awesome it's a
whole like little library of liners it's
got black brown bronze gold in like
almond or champagne and it'd be a better
this is awesome
let's try I'm just gonna pick a random
I'm picking the brown one and let's see
how whoa it is like slidy pigmented in a
good way you know what I mean awesome I
want to try one of the gold ones now too
just to kind of see cuz sometimes the
formula can differ per color oh my gosh
these are so smooth can you see the gold
it's right there it's kind of harder to
see wow wow wow wow this is pretty cool
I have to admit that's pretty awesome
alright next thing it looks like there's
like a little cute pencil sharpener I
guess I could go with the liners sweet
recipe candy stick from a tune house is
it actually candy or is it makeup number
six
it's a glossy type liftin Oh cute so you
take off the giant cap and then can you
yeah it's just a lip tint yeah it's more
like a lip balm you know it's got a
little bit of a tint to it it's not bad
cute I feel like it'll take up odd
amounts of space in my purse but it's
cute okay what next
muddy girl it's like it looks like food
where is it number five a wash off type
mud pack clay mud and charcoal soothe
purify moisturize the skin okay that's
pretty cool actually that might be a fun
like spa night type of thing to do for
myself
next thing split end there opee no rents
leaving ponytail treatment first reducer
is on the go it's got one hair up oh and
it comes with a cute little thing - that
is adorable
what does it say beyond that though hmm
eight types of amino acids in it repair
split ends so you just put it basically
on the ends of your hair and let it sit
in there for a while and then you take
it out interesting alright next thing
what this is from a tude house which is
a brand I have heard of looks like it's
like a little Dutch like a nesting doll
of some kind oh my gosh okay so this is
just a lid and it's what is it some sort
of like lotion or something
number four missing you hand cream oh
yeah this is the most adorable packaging
I've ever seen are you kidding me just
to have that like just sitting on your
vanity or you desk or whatever that is
so cute I would have bought that one
just straight-up bought it okay these
are all oh these are all like the same
thing there's lifting cream whitening
capsule cream and more lifting cream oh
I got two black tea lifting let's see
well what does it say that yeah and
that's what kind of thinks about getting
things from a country you know you've
got to go back and forth because it
doesn't say
anything on the thing I did that make
any sense all right high concentrates of
vitamin C deeply nourishes and
moisturizing the skin leaving a nice
glow yeah so it's just a face oh but
this is what's inside are you kidding me
okay that's adorable so it's just like a
face cream but there's three of them
what is this Mike I don't really notice
the smell that is so freaking cute
though are you kidding me
so the last thing is my influenster
voxbox this is a site where even my
boyfriend is doing it now where you
basically take surveys and and review
different products on there and then you
get like kind of like points based on
how much you're influencing others and
you don't have to be a youtuber or a
blog or anything like that my boyfriend
doesn't he doesn't do any of that stuff
then of course he's like the male
version of it but still so you can
basically earn free boxes of things for
you to try out and usually it's new
products that companies are just sending
out and want to get the word out for so
no freakin way if you've been watching
my videos you're going to die when I
show you the very first thing I saw no
but they don't oh okay so I have been
getting randomly like maybe once a month
maybe once every other month and
influenster voxbox and every time I get
placed export tampons and I laugh
because I'm like whoa I mean they'll get
used it's not like you know it's useful
but I laugh cuz I'm like I never have to
buy them because every month I get a box
and it's always in there and lo and
behold here they are and I had a
subscriber also send me one as a joke /
it was useful but I thought that was so
funny and here we are what is the name
of this bar so that's what I need to
know I think it's like the vitae
vitality box box so yeah that's the
vitality I don't know if so that's one
of the things in there totally useful
then it's got bikini-ready
energy gummies it says it tastes great
boosts metabolism increases energy and
gee I've got two gummies in here gummies
such a funny word interesting hold on to
those but when I'm feeling like crazy
tired alright the next thing I'm seeing
is first-degree burn cream that would be
helpful I have two burns here on my arm
from my curling wand so I will be using
that and I will probably run out of it
because I burned myself all the time I
am a complete moron anyway so
interesting and awesome
next thing I'm seeing is this Elizabeth
Arden flawless future caplets serum so
it's just like a trial it's got those
cool little like beads in there you know
what do you do with it though skincare
system smooth over your cleanse face and
neck morning and night before so it's
just it is just a true serum before your
moisturizer you put this on so awesome
I'll try it out it's not a little
miniature pump so I do like that nextly
we've got oh I will use this I've been
wanting to try this the soft lips cube
they kind of came out with a similar
like kind of like the EOS ones
501 lip care and it's in the scent
pomegranate blueberry oh yeah so that
will definitely get used and the last
thing in here is this giant no way its
vitality so I think I earned it by like
earning like a active badge or like a
athletic I don't know whatever this is
straight up tea used to straight up the
whole thing a tea that's like some
that's so actually pretty cool I can't
believe they shipped it in here with all
this but I will use this it's purely
sweet tea I mean it looks yummy I like
that there's a lot like you could have
this and drink it kind of all day you
know like drink half for like with the
snack and half for lunch or something
like that so I like the size of it
so that's all that was in the
Influenster vitae box or whatever I'll
put the influencer info below I don't
know if you still have to be invited to
join the site or not every once in a
while on Instagram if I have invitations
I can give because they only give me so
many when I have them I'll usually post
on there like hey if you want to be
invited send me your email the first
five people I can invite so follow me on
there or on Twitter or both because when
I get those that's usually where I put
that out there so but you might not need
the invitations anymore I don't know
regardless so hopefully that video was
helpful for you guys I know that was a
lot of different boxes kind of coming at
you but I love doing these and I I'm
thankful to companies willing to send
them to me whether I review positively
or negatively because it's helpful for
you guys to know you know month to month
they're not always awesome and sometimes
they are awesome so that probably made
no sense but you know what I mean anyway
I'll catch you guys very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
