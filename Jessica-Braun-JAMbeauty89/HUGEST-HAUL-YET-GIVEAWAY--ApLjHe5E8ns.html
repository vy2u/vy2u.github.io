an absolutely gigantic haul it might be
one of my largest hauls yet really like
for real this is humongous so let's go
ahead and get started because there is a
lot to cover I'm gonna tell you right
now this is about to be a long video so
strap in if you don't like long videos
then feel free to not watch all of it or
not watch it at all if you like long
videos well you're in for a treat cuz
this is gonna be a long one okay so a
few companies have sent me some things
that I want to show you guys I haven't
tried them out yet but kind of just give
you an idea some things I'm going to be
trying out and then also I have a
subscriber that sent me something
because I recently got a peel box and
it's listed below now under any recent
videos that I've done but I just
recently got one and she is the first
subscriber I've ever gotten anything in
my peel box from so I thought that was
kind of exciting so I wanted to open
that because I haven't opened it yet so
I'm so excited and then a ton of
drugstore things some things I got their
higher end that I bought from HauteLook
and okay Oh in a target beauty box if
you haven't heard about that get ready
okay so let's start with the sub e mail
because I'm so excited
alright so I ripped open the box just so
I wouldn't have to cut it okay so it
looks like there is a letter
ooh you have cute handwriting this is
from Ashley Hernandez by the way well I
love you too Ashley that is so so sweet
what a kind and oh my gosh it looks like
she's got she must know that I love
Disney some little Disney stickers here
oh my gosh that is adorable
oh that makes our hearts so happy I was
just watching a Disney movie while this
getting ready today by the way which I
do most the time it's gonna be great one
day when I have kids because I'm gonna
love watching Disney movies with them
okay so we'll start with this little guy
here sorry my nails are naked
they've been naked a lot lately though
but no it's winter and I think can use a
break so I've been giving them a break a
lot whoo it's an Ulta cream eyeshadow I
love cream shadows oh my gosh and it's
in it's in the shade and metallic and
look at it it's like a really pretty
bronzy color isn't that pretty
it reminds me of like Maybelline's bad
to the bronze or whatever but I'm really
excited to try that and I haven't I've
only tried a few Ulta brand makeup items
so I actually am excited and that was a
long time ago so I'm excited to give
that a try you wrap these good sweet I'm
wondering if these are all this is an
Ulta blush and it's in the shade girlie
and look at that pretty peach color and
I like how sleek it is really tiny
packaging that's it's just nice just in
general when you're you know when you've
got it in a makeup bag it doesn't take
up much room but also in my collection
you know can fit more if everything were
not as vocally packaged okay you want to
edit out all this unwrapping time
in a while okay another Ulta ooh these
are fun colors it's a little eyeshadow
quad and it's got Sahara sand can you
see it yeah
Sahara sand sunkissed mosaic and
glittering sand that might be the other
way around that's probably most I don't
know either way those are the four
sheets aren't those beautiful again you
adorable packaging so cute okay and the
last thing in here so sweet of her
that's what kills me I think the idea
that someone is out there like thinking
of me enough to send me something or
send me a letter is just there's
something just so wonderfully humbling
and just wonderfully just made my it
made my day when I really can't open
this one it just genuinely made my day
really you should see my boyfriend
cracks up the way I react but it's just
so sweet okay I'm gonna have to get
scissors alone okay ooh two different
things are in this little guy
alright oh I'm excited so this is Ulta
brand lip crayon in the shade rumors it
looks like it's this kind of it reminds
me of the Revlon in honey
maybe a little deeper but I've been
wearing a lot of deeper color so I'm
excited and then this I'm really excited
about the old Ulta super shiny lip gloss
and sweet look how pretty pink it's so
perfect for spring this is so exciting
because like I said I really have not
tried a lot of Ulta brand so thank you
actually that's so thoughtful so
thoughtful you genuinely made my day
which I've said like 10 times I know but
I'm being serious
and I love your letter and I love the
Disney stickers and I love all these
thank you so much alright so this
company ravpower sent me this it's
called their luster series POW power
bank and basically it's a charger for
your phone but one that you don't that
you can just have with you and if you
don't if you aren't able to plug your
phone into a wall you can plug your
phone into this and it's supposed to
give your phone a full charge depending
on your phone I guess so I still have an
iPhone 4s so I would assume you'd work
for this so I haven't tried it yet but
look how cute this is it's kind of head
not heavy heavy but a little heavier
than you think just looking at it
but on the side it's got a USB port in
one of the little is that it what is
that a mini USB anyway so you can charge
it into that it also has a flashlight
and then a strobe isn't that cool
but they also sent me one in black for
my boyfriend to try out so he's gonna
try it out I'm gonna try it out I'll let
you guys know what we kind of discover
about this brand they're relatively
inexpensive I'll put a link for this
down below if you're interested but I
was excited to try it cuz I've never
really tried anything like this to be
honest I'm wondering if you guys have if
you've tried this before how you like it
or if you've tried any other brands of
this how you like it let me know down
below so alright what else we'll go
ahead and do the HauteLook stuff I was
so excited when this brand Yves pearl
was on HauteLook and I've seen it on
there a few times but it's not on there
as often as like the balm is and things
like that so when I saw that it was I
lost my mind a little bit
now I ordered three things from there
and I've been using them cuz I've got I
got him a few weeks ago but it's such a
good deal because they think these
things are so expensive but on HauteLook
they're like fifteen dollars sometimes
less depending I mean it really was not
bad and I've been wanting to try all of
these things for awhile so the one like
number one eight Pro item that I wanted
to try is there what's it's called
there's salmon concealer and treatment
and this is one of the reasons this
brand is so well known at least for me
that's why I knew about it now I've
already tried it out but it's this
salmon colored concealer and I got it in
the shade fair so they do have different
shade versions of the salmon concealer
but it's very creamy
it definitely cancels out anything you
got going on I mean it is like crazy
high coverage oh my gosh it stays on all
day and what was so cool is halfway
through the day I was with some students
and like it my eyes felt like they were
so moisturized down there it was the
weirdest thing and this is a concealer
and treatment so I don't know exactly
what it's supposed to do but I know that
it just like I don't know how to
describe it
literally just felt like moisturize
halfway through the day I was just like
oh my gosh my undereyes feels so good
and I'm sure that makes me sound insane
which well what else is new but it was
bizarre and I've never felt that arms
like this stuff is amazing I just fit
all myself over that I need to get
something to wipe this stuff off of
course I do
other eat pearl stuff so this is their
eye palette and it's got six eyeshadows
and the the name of the quad is
unnatural and oh my my my this is
awesome it reminds me in a weird way of
The Naked basics palette except for it's
a little more of what I wish The Naked
basics palette was because I love that
palette but there's so many light shades
and not really any medium shades I feel
like so this one really covers those
well they're absolutely gorgeous did
that middle one no yeah it did it's just
closer to my skin tone I mean come on
isn't that beautiful oh my gosh so this
and I feel like that was like $15 on
there which for really high-quality
shadows and it's easy to travel with and
for six shadows in it that's not bad
think about you pay $50 for the Naked
palette you know okay and then the other
eight pearl item I got was their
bronzing highlighter trio in classic and
I was so excited about this because I
hadn't heard anything about it before
and it comes with these three shades and
again I think this was about 15 dollars
on HauteLook originally I'm sure it was
like 40 but they're so smooth look at
those now the bronzer for my skin tone
is clearly a little too deep I've used
it and you know and of with a very light
hand and it works but I love these two
colors and I think if you
they had other trio shade selections you
know what I mean so definitely keep your
eye out for when this is on HauteLook
because I frankly I can't wait for it to
be on there again so I could buy more
and the bomb was on there the other day
and I didn't end up buying anything on
there and now I'm like I should've
bought more stuff I love the ball as if
I need anything else I know
alright so this is we I still have a
bunch of drugstore stuff to get to but
before I get to that I wanted to show
you this is kind of awkward for me to
show you guys and the reason is that
it I don't know I'm probably being silly
but this company called nude where sent
me just I know I get embarrassed over
silly things but whatever but they sent
me this stuff to review and I haven't
tried it yet but I'll have to let you
guys know how I like it
it's uh this is called I gotta know what
is it actually called it's their clear
bra and basically it comes like this
they look like implants do they not I
mean come on
but if you're wearing a dress where the
back is really low and so you could wear
strapless bra with this you know have
straps but then you've got the back
showing this is supposed to solve that
problem you don't need a straps so
basically you have these two like gel
things I mean they're bendable and stuff
but they're thick and they get it in
your size and then these clasps together
so it kind of it really really does stay
there's sticky on it and I tried them on
the other day and I was like it actually
works like I thought no there's no way
they're gonna stay put they're not going
anywhere
it was amazing I wonder if celebrities
use this when they have low back dresses
I was amazed it actually works now I
haven't gotten to wear it out yet to see
but and then they also have their
seamless panty and this is like the
thong version I have not worn this yet
so I don't know but it I got it just in
a nude and it's one of those really soft
feeling you know so I'll have to let you
guys know how seamless they actually are
okay so I also hmm I'll show you the
target beauty box first so this is what
it looks like it's five dollars and
there's free shipping at least you're
supposed to get free shipping when you
order it and now I know what's in here
but I haven't actually like so it's got
like little cards I'm sure to read and
then I'd seen like what's in it cuz you
can tell before you order it what's in
it but this is just so exciting seeing
it up close so for five dollars you get
this lip gloss which is the covergirl
smoochies sizzle gloss in the shade
blind dates like a sparkly pink and then
you also get this Jergens BB body
perfecting skin cream which is really
exciting because talk to you from glam
life guru really really likes this stuff
and I guess it's supposed to be like a
BB cream for your body at all it adds
some
color it supposedly perfects it over
time who knows but this one's in light
skin tones and I think she recommended
the darker one so we'll see but I'm
excited to give it a try cuz this is
expensive in the full-size it also came
at the Herbal Essence dry shampoo which
is travel size which is awesome and I
haven't tried this yet so yay
and then a Toni &amp;amp; Guy casual sea salt
texturizing spray I don't feel like I
keep getting a lot of these and I don't
really have a use for them in my hair
routine but I'll still try it out and
let you guys know and then also geez all
of this for five dollars it's insane the
voluminous butterfly mascara which I
have not tried yet so I'm really excited
to try it's in black so I mean that's so
much stuff for that so it was such a
good deal that I also bought one I have
it right here to give away to you guys
so the rules for entering are below you
can enter as many times as you'd like to
definitely check it out and so that you
can enter because it's such a good deal
isn't it so and then on to the drugstore
stuff that I got I bought first of all I
needed a hair spray so I got that
Alberto vo5 salon series perfect hold
only use it a few times I liked it so
far and it was like $3 and frankly I
didn't even know that this brand still
existed
I also repurchase my favorite burger
brunette shampoo and conditioner and
this is in the multi tone revealing and
I love this stuff and I was trying out
that clear shampoo stuff and I don't
like it so far I've used like half of it
and I really don't like it for my hair
type it's not working so I repurchase
this is the third time every bought it
because I love it so yeah I also on
target's website bought the EOS lip balm
in stick form and this isn't pomegranate
isn't this awesome so you know I like I
love the shape and that's what's so fun
and quirky about us but sometimes I feel
weird like in class like doing that so
I'm excited to have it in stick form too
and then I also got the john frieda for
repair repairing oil elixir it has a
pump which I like I if I can get this
off but I haven't tried it yet so off to
let you know and I also I'm on the hunt
for the best natural deodorant and this
is the crystal body deodorant roll-on
and type Rayo genic fragrance and
paraben free it's endorsed by Cancer
Treatment Centers so it's based on
natural salts and it is liquid with a
like a huge rollerball so you do have to
kind of let
dry but it works on me so far I've only
used it a few times off to keep you guys
updated and then I also bought the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation I got it in the lightest
shade 805 which is ivory has a pump you
can actually control how much comes out
and I've owned this before and I
returned it after a few uses because I
thought I was breaking me out
I learned eventually that it was my
makeup wipes I was breaking out so I
finally repurchase it and I'm wearing
today stuff you guys I might do a full
review if you guys are interested in it
let me know I also got two Maybelline
items that are new the master highlight
blush in pink rose which swatches
beautifully and it actually lasts for a
long time whoa too close I've noticed it
lasts for a pretty long time can you
guys see that but it it's swatch is
prettier than it actually appears on
your cheek so I like it I don't think
it's my favorite but I need to give it
some more love to see and then I also
got a Maybelline quad in mocha motion
and this is one for shades that are just
perfect for me for my everyday use I'll
swatch them for you guys if I can there
they are these two here my favorite but
they're nice mid-tones and then there's
a deep one and a really light one so
it's the perfect everyday look I just
love it and I feel like a lot of quads
don't have enough mid-tones that are
cooler shades so I was really excited by
this so it came as always in this $10 a
month link is below the bag is hideous
now it's artwork and it actually had a
thing connected to it that says the
print the bag is from artists Clara
Cerises geography-based series so
apparently the series is called street
Anatomy and it showcases San Francisco
and I guess that's her hometown and it's
also hip C headquarters they said and it
gives you the website you can view more
of her art but so I guess this is
supposed to be an interesting I guess I
will obviously abstract version of San
Francisco in some way so interesting I
don't know but I don't like it on a
makeup bag that's all I'll say so and
probably one you might see this in a
giveaway I don't know cuz I'm not gonna
use it maybe I'll give it to my sisters
we'll see so it came with
the well let's see let's grab the thing
because it a destination beauty is the
theme and it came with this nail polish
Nicole by OPI it's in the shade on what
grounds and it's called ruffles so I'm
assuming this is like textured I don't
know how well you can see that but it
looks like a robin's egg blue but it's
got like little white texture beads in
there so excited to see that's gonna be
was so pretty for spring I mean for real
and then it also came with this pixie
flawless beauty primer I wonder if this
is its it says an even skin tone and
it's a face primer adds a youthful glow
and it's hydrating oh that's got a lot
of claims but I'm curious to know what
color it is yeah so it looks like if you
can see that it's like a beige color
yeah you might not go see it which is
good
for me at least it would blend in it
feels it does feel moisturizing that's
for sure I mean and it's I mean a pretty
decent sized product it's as biggest
like the maybelline baby skin primer
that I bought at the drugstore that's
full-size so I'm assuming this is just
full size and then it also came with
this via bombshell
eyes shadow things and oh it's a quad
and it's in Bora Bora okay again the
packaging is like Mac you know but it's
this no okay oh it's got all these
shades in it this reminds me of that
Ulta quad that's funny
these are I mean it really does that's
so fun what are the odds of that really
isn't that funny
those are like almost exact wow that
just blows my mind what are the odds
that these were put together anyway so
go figure and then also the last thing
so this one only came with four items
which you know it's not that big of a
deal and I'm really excited about well
so far all of these and this is a bare
minerals marvelous Moxie lipstick which
and it looks like it's in the shade get
ready it's a cute little mini that is
cute but it's got it I mean that's not
a terrible small amount I mean I've
literally never run out of a lipstick
before oh it looks so moisturizing look
at that color
okay I'm dang it I'm excited to wear
this like for real I think I'm gonna
wear it tonight on my lips again is the
Besame exotic pink lipstick that I
literally can't get enough of I wear it
all the time in my earrings where did I
get these I'm assuming I got these from
shop lately I know a lot of you guys
asked when I wear because I don't wear
funky earrings that often but I love

Wow okay that's it so if see not too bad
of a month I'm really excited with the
lipstick and the primer then nail polish

color but I've got funny you know posh
