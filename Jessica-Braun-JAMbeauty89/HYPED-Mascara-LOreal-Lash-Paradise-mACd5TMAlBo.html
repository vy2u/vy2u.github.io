a review of the much talked-about
L'Oreal voluminous lash paradise
mascaras you have not heard about this
mascara
he might be living under a rock I was
even out of the country I feel like when
all the like fuss is going on and I
heard about it well why is that that
crazy everyone hears about everything
everywhere anyway so this is I've got it
pulled up if I can unlock my phone fast
enough I've got to pulled up on altas
website here on my phone and I wanted to
read you guys the claims and also just
tell you a little bit about it if you
haven't heard about it or maybe you just
want to know a little bit more before
you bite the bullet and actually buy it
for yourself so on oulton website this
retails for $9.99 I feel like I got mine
for like $5.99 or maybe $7.99 elsewhere
of course look for coupons look for bio
and get one half off field etc but also
$9.99 they have blackest black mystic
black black and black brown I am sure
this is oh this is just what I would
have guessed it is blackest black I
think I meant to get blackest black but
that's right um you get point to eight
ounces of this and it comes in this
really cute pink light pink packaging a
little bit of gold the gold kind of
wears off really really quickly that is
one thing I've noticed but beyond that
you open it and it's got kind of a
natural bristle brush kind of a bigger
one a thicker one but that's pretty much
it that's all there is to the actual
container the price etc so I wanted to
read what the claims are for this so so
take your lashes to paradise
L'Oreal voluminous lash paradise mascara
is their first mascara for voluptuous
volume and length now with even more
black pigments soft wavy bristle brush
holds seams sounds weird dramatically
soft wavy bristle brush holds maximum
formula for a dramatic volumizing charge
where who wrote this anyway okay I would
agree with that so far it's got the soft
the brush is kind of wavy and it does
have a good amount of formula but not so
much that you can't control
what you're doing so the benefits it
lists these two hundred-plus bristles
Wow
catch every lash for a full fringe
effect smooth glide formula provides
silky volume in one extra black coat
we'll talk about that lash is our
feathery soft to the touch
pretty much women agree 91% saw intense
and volume eyes lashes and 87% saw more
beautiful lashes plus 98% lengthening
effect voluptuous volume and length
softly the wavy bristle brush they're
obsessed with that and more black
segments alright so I am wearing this
today I've been wearing this like every
day since I tried it because this really
does live up to its hype I've never
tried a mascara the only thing that came
close of course is my favorite it
cosmetics super hair mascara I think I
like this better and it's cheaper
because with this of course it's way
cheaper like I said but with this you
put on one coat and I'll show you what
I'm talking about it me applying it this
morning you put on essentially one coat
you know you kind of go back and forth
between your lashes and it already looks
amazing and sometimes I'll go in after
like a minute and do another coat if I'm
really feeling it but most of the time
the one coat is more than enough now of
course I did a lot more of a natural
look today and that's really what I've
been doing a lot this summer and I just
love it every time I've worn this
mascara and I've been like around
friends everyone remarks what are you
wearing on your lashes because it's that
noticeable now again this is one of
those things that I've got bright lights
on me and a camera you know a couple
feet away from me so it's hard to it's
hard to get across the effect it has
unless you're in person I'm going to
zoom you in and let's see if I can get
you a little closer okay so you can kind
of see it a little bit better here I
just feel like it really does create
like a feathery look and you know I'm
not wearing nearly as much eyeliner as I
usually do because I just feel like with
this mascara I just don't need it I
don't know it does a great job on the
lower lashes as well and it's just it's
easy to apply it's comfortable to wear I
haven't No
any flaking beneath and I've had this
one in particular at least a month maybe
a little bit longer and the formula from
the day you open it to I guess the day
you decide to throw it away it just
seems to stay the same so like some
mascaras when you first open them
they're like really difficult to like
you have to wait a few weeks for it to
really be at like it's perfect formula
for it to kind of dry out this one is
ready to go the day you open it it is
amazing so it's a much drier formula and
I don't mean that in an uncomfortable
way I mean that in a it's just ready to
go the day you open it it sticks where
you put it it's just a beautiful mascara
I can't stress it enough if you haven't
tried it and you're skeptical just try
it you'll see what everyone's talking
about I feel like a lot of drugstore
things when they're new and they come
out people freak out about it because
it's new and maybe the packaging is cute
or you know whatever it might be but
then after like a month or two no-one's
talking about anymore I don't foresee
that with this I'm sure some people will
stop talking about but it's just so good
like it's so good this is like become my
favorite mascara that quickly and you
know I think I've tried every single
mascara that's in the drugstore just
about this is the best in the drugstore
hands down easily no matter what your
lashes are like I think you will
absolutely love this so hopefully this
review is helpful for you if you are
interested in more of my drugstore

gears of all kinds of drugstore products
