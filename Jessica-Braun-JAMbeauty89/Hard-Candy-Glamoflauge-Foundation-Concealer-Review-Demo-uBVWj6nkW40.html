bringing you a double review of the hard
candy glamoflauge Foundation and also
the hard candy glamoflauge concealer now
the concealer I've had for a very long
time like a year and a half this I just
picked up its brand new at Walmart hard
candy is only sold at Walmart you can
sometimes find some of their products
online the concealer I'm pretty sure you
can find online the foundation is not
online yet but what it is I'll put a
link below for it now the concealer
retails for around six dollars in the
foundation is $7 I'm going to go ahead
and get into a demo of me applying both
of these to my face with a few different
products you can get an idea of how they
work when you apply it with a Beauty
Blender versus your fingers etc so let's
go ahead and get into that and
afterwards I'll get into the details of
the pros and cons of these and whether
or not I would recommend them okay so
I'm going to apply half of my face with
a Beauty Blender and the other half I'm
going to apply with my hands I have
tried this with a brush two different
times and it was horrible I use like a
really good Sigma brush that works with
everything and I use some other kind of
brush I think my Real Techniques brush
which I literally use with every
foundation and this foundation just kept
smearing across and it was just weird
and streaky so I've tried it with my
hands but I haven't tried to get the
Beauty Blender so we're gonna see how
that goes so on this half of my face I'm
going to use the Beauty Blender so I
have it in the shade 930 porcelain and
it's got its pump which I love I only
have moisturizer on my face the elf
moisturizer I haven't used I'm not going
to use a primer because I want to see
what it does on its own so I'm just
gonna dot it around this is more of a
yellow tinted one look like I've got war
paint on so I'm just gonna use the
bigger part of it just start from the
inside and work my way out
so I just finished this side and when
you compare of course I've got some
breakouts I'm dealing with but when you
compare the two it certainly covers a
lot I think it's actually a pretty good
match for my skin tone I know with my
ring light I think it looks a little
lighter but in real life it's actually a
pretty good match if this color wouldn't
work for me in the summer but that's
okay so I'm interested to see if this
how this will cover some of these
breakouts that I've got going on so
let's go and try it in this side I'm
going to do with my hand
so what I'm noticing with my hand is
that it's really really streaky and it's
the same thing I got with my when I used
a brush so I'm gonna do the rest of this
with a Beauty Blender because I can't
even handle this right now
so what I'm noticing is that anywhere
that I have dryness which is right here
it's really illuminating it and any
redness I have it really didn't cover
that well so like my nose is always red
just forever and I mean you can probably
tell in every video because I've got a
lot of freckles and a little bit of
hyperpigmentation so it didn't really
help with that either it feels a little
bit tacky but it's kind of settling in
so I get no longer feels tacky up here
so I have a feeling that will go away it
feels light
it feels very lightweight it doesn't
feel like a heavy cream which I do like
and I feel like my skin can breathe
however the smell of it is really really
pungent it smells like melted plastic
and that alone kind of makes me think
what am I putting on my skin here so
that's kind of how I'm feeling about it
right now now I'm also going to use the
hard candy glamoflauge to cover up these
but I'm also going to use it to conceal
my under eye just because why not and
this is in light they have some shades
that are lighter now but I've had this
for quite a while it does after you've
had it for a while it does start to
separate and so you have to like kind of
score it a little bit out before you use
it but it's fine now because I've been
using it a lot more so I'm just going to
get put it anywhere I've got darkness
I'm going to kind of take it down and
even a little bit across you can already
see how bright and it looks so I'm just
going to use my Beauty Blender to press
it into the skin this I think does work
a lot better with the Beauty Blender
because it is such a thick formula that
I think it can kind of look cakey and
dry if you use a brush I think your
finger works well too because it's got
that heat working with it but it really
does a gorgeous job of brightening I
mean look at the difference between this
and that I love this I don't like to use
this every single day on my under eye
because if I've got any um I don't know
I just noticed that it wears well
throughout the day but if I've got any
dryness under my eye it doesn't do as
well so if you know that you have a
dry under eye area I would say you
probably would not like this under your
eye but I'll show you here in a second
how I cover up blemishes and I like this
for covering facial blemishes a lot so
my under eyes conceal to feel a lot
better there so now I'm going to use a
little bit to kind of conceal these now
this some people supposedly use this for
covering tattoos I don't know about all
that but I do know it works pretty well
covering redness so you notice that kind
of dotted all around it as well just to
make it a little less obvious that I'm
covering a very specific spot and I just
kind of go around it
um I'm not one to 100% perfectly conceal
something because sometimes when you're
trying to conceal something so you can't
see any spot it ends up looking worse
because you can just see where it's
pinpointed whereas I'll just kind of do
a wash around it and so yes you can
still see that there are marks there but
it's not crazy red and crazy obvious I
think it looks a little bit better so
for me that's how I like it because I'm
up close with people a lot as a teacher
and I don't want to look cakey so I
don't mind that you can kind of see them
but now they look more like freckles
than they do
giant red pimples you know what I mean
let's go ahead and start with the
concealer pros and cons because I've
been using this for so long that I
really have a good idea of how I like it
and how it works this is great I think
at concealing blemishes on your face I
use it under my eye what I'm like crazy
for whatever reason like dark I usually
will grab for this but when it's every
day and I don't really need that much
coverage I usually just don't use it
because I don't need that much but if
you know that you've got really purple
under-eye circles this is fantastic I've
heard that some people use it to cover
tattoos I don't really know if that
works or not
but it really is heavy duty and you can
really pile it on I do think this is
best applied with either your finger or
a Beauty Blender I think with the brush
it works but it's not as good as it
could be I also think that if you have
dry
skin anywhere under your eye it just
kind of accentuates that so you might
want to stay away from this if you know
that you have dryness under there I do
think this stays all day even when I've
covered blemishes it really doesn't move
which is really important when you're
covering something that you don't want
people to see you don't want it to go
anywhere so I do feel like especially
when you set this with some sort of a
powder on top it just stays put now
let's go deeper into this foundation
this I have very mixed feelings about
because obviously one of the major pros
is that it's crazy inexpensive for a
foundation seven dollars is awesome
especially when there's a lot of
drugstore foundations that are now $12
$13 on price but seven dollars is not
bad one of the huge cons however is the
shade selection I died when I saw how
they had tons of light options and like
no dark options and I know that's the
case with a lot of drugstore lines but
this was one of the worst I've seen when
it comes to shade selections so if you
are a darker skin gal I mean they just
don't have anything it's terrible one of
the other promos however is the
packaging the fact that it's got a pump
and you can control how much comes out
with this pump in its plastic bottle
which I actually like because Tyler and
I travel all the time and I don't
necessarily want to travel with glass
bottles one of the cons however is the
smell it smells like melted plastic it
really is just a really gross gross
smell now it's not a smell that you
notice once it's on you're not you can't
really smell it but just while applying
it especially when it's early in the
morning and you're putting it on the
last thing you feel like smelling is
like burnt plastic I do think this
covers pretty well I would say it's a
medium coverage foundation you can build
it up but I also think it's a dewy
foundation you can see I don't have any
highlight on but you can see that
there's kind of a radiance coming from
my skin I think that the other downside
even this even though this is a dewy
foundation it does accentuate my dry
spots now that was made better by using
a Beauty Blender and in regards to how
to apply this I would say Beauty Blender
or at least some sort of beauty sponge
the Real Techniques one or any one that
you like moisten it and use it with this
a brush it looks terrible fingers it
looks terrible I have now
her plate with the foundation and had
that experience where it only looks good
with the Beautyblender
so that is a downside where if you don't
have a beauty sponge that you like I
would say just stay away from this
foundation honestly it doesn't feel
heavy at all which is nice it feels very
lightweight it doesn't feel like I'm
really wearing anything which is funny
because the glamoflage concealer is so
thick but this is a nice thin
consistency so it doesn't feel weird it
doesn't feel tacky once it's kind of set
into the skin I do think it lasts pretty
well throughout the day I actually was
wearing this the other day and I did my
very first 8 mile run with Tyler we're
training for a mini marathon and I'm all
nervous but but I ran with this and it
actually looked great after my run and
eight mile run in like 45 degree weather
outside and it still looked fine so
other than the fact that of course it
was like crazy dry and those spots and
that looked weird so would I recommend
this overall and I mean it had some
great pros but it also has a lot of cons
and there are so many amazing drugstore
foundation if I were to recommend some
drugstore foundations to you I would
recommend from the drugstore the L'Oreal
infallible it is like double the price
is like $13 but these are these
foundations are amazing another favorite
of mine that I don't hear talked about a
lot is the Rimmel lasting finish
foundation this is so amazing now this
is the lightest color they have and it's
still a little dark for me but it still
works in the formula is amazing I'm
working on a review for this one but if
I were to recommend some other than this
one I would recommend these and this one
is I think even cheaper I want to say
this like 5 or 6 dollars I hope that
review is helpful for you guys if you're
interested in any of my other drugstore
review and demo videos I'll link the
playlist below if you enjoyed please
