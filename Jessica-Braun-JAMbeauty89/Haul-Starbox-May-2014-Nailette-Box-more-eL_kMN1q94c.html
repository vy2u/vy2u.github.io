like sit down and film so I'm just not
getting some stuff out for you guys
because there are so many different
things I've been trying to review and
I'm trying out and I'm like how do I
even organize this I'm sure buddy going
a little and same with my stack of boxes
of things that like especially
subscription boxes that I'm trying to
tell you guys about some of them it's
like too late I'm gonna sit down and
film these knock these out for you guys
so you guys can know what's going on in
the world of makeup boxes and then I
have some other things i want to show
you to that I've gotten that i'm gonna
be using and trying out so let's start
with the cutest thing i got this is a
little tiny box and it's a subscription
service and it's ten dollars a month
actually is 999 and it's called nail let
and the woman that started this
contacted me recently and I just thought
it was the cutest idea because I
literally keep getting rid of nail
polish because they're old and I even
use thinner in it and they're just not
quite the same and like I buy all this
nail polish and it goes bad before I can
ever use even a third of it let alone a
whole Bob so I just realized that that
had become a problem I I guess I hadn't
even realized it was a problem until I
was getting rid of a bunch and she
contacted me and said that they
specialize in mini nail polish and at
first I was like like I don't want to
pay money for a bunch of mini but then I
thought that solves that problem of
having some that go back I have never
gone through an entire bottle of nail
polish actually I might have once and it
was okie eyes japanese rose garden which
I love it's the prettiest pink but other
than that everything else ends up going
back so I thought actually that's a
genius idea and it's 999 so it's not too
much and you get two minis in it and
what I like is you tell them I'm looking
at their website now you tell them your
skin tone light medium or dark and then
it says your preferred nail polish style
and it says I chose I don't remember
what I told her now that I'm think about
but they're simple in subtle
sophisticated and classy bold and edgy
or I like to mix it up so you have to
choose that and then you can choose how
often you want it to happen do you want
it every month or every other month
which i think is cool too so they carry
Seop I and orally I love all of them out
of them orly the formula of orally
polishes unbelievable I literally own
one and I got it on Clarence and
but this is the best thing ever and I
still haven't bought any more so like
tang and then OPI I like right under
that and then SES he always chips on me
no matter what my base coat is no matter
what my top coat is and then i'll use
something different and it'll be fine
with that base and top coat but SEI I
don't know and of course I think it does
differ per color well I'm just writing
about nail polish anyway so this was
just adorable and I can't wait to see
what colors I actually got so it's the
nail at jun 2014 box it's just package
cute little tips okay so ooh the first
one is OPI does it say it on here okay
sorry she wrote a little note says hey
Jess here are two of our favorite spring
and summer classy and subtle colors so
that must have been when I chose of
course I did um se under the Twilight oh
that's not the one I opened already dang
it i read it too soon OPI love angel
music baby so this is this really cute
goldtone OPI nail polish its mini but i
actually really like it and I wonder oh
yeah it looks it actually looks pretty
opaque hopefully it actually is and
again I really like the OPI formula so
yay and then the other one that comes in
it now I know it was an SE under the
toilet oh that's a pretty color it's
like this kind of muted grayish purple
that's a really pretty color and again
this miniature size like I said at first
I was kind of put off cuz I'm like well
why am I spend that much money on minis
but at the end of the day I've never
used more than even a mini so it kind of
is perfect and they're just so cute so I
thought that was just fun and I really
want to share that with you guys in case
I know there's a lot of nail polish
lovers out there now I you know my nails
aren't painted now I i go through phases
where i paint all the time and that I
don't because I just feel like my nails
need a break and they do I mean I just I
really have trouble with my nails and
I'm taking vitamins to try and help
supplement but but I just thought this
is a really cute idea so definitely if
you love nail polish you should check it
out because I just thought was cute and
just a little bit different did she so
cute okay so i have to mention these
headphones to you guys yes and I know
that's weird because I don't that's not
something I would typically talk about
but I have been on the hunt for freaking
fantastic headphones because I'm
music person like I went to school and
studied music i like to hear it exactly
how it's supposed to be I listened to
classical music at the gym I and i know
i'm a nerd but I also listen like
hip-hop and I want it to sound awesome
especially when I'm running and I'm
trying to like get pumped you know what
I'm saying I need it to be blaring but
also sound awesome so I've bought like
different sony headphones um I can now
of course I can't think of any I bought
like probably eight or nine pairs of
headphones that are the kind that go in
the ear which are like the ones I'm
about to tell you about that don't hurt
my ears so they have like the different
sizes cuz you know summer too big and
just like how um and finally these now
like I said there's $79 so they're
pricey I know but there are way more
expensive headphones out there and if
you really are kind of a sound snob like
I am you're going to love these and
they're cute they got this like wood
grain detail and like I said you can
change the size of the part that
actually goes in your ear they're just
kind of classy looking but on top of
that the sound is unbelievable I
literally plugged it in and I was
playing some hip-hop song I'm sure it
was incredibly inappropriate but it was
have like really loud pumping base and I
was like this is going to be a good test
to see and it was amazing I turn it all
the way up and it was crystal clear like
this has never happened and here's the
deal my logic is i spend like ten to
twenty dollars on a pair of inexpensive
headphones and then they break or they
just kind of the sound quality is no
good or like one of them will stop
working after a while you know that
happens and so i thought why not this is
a way better one and while it is $79 at
the same time if you're spending fifteen
dollars here $25 there every year
getting a new pair why not invest in a
really good pair hopefully that will
last you a really long time so I'm
really excited about these I know that
was random and I'll shut up about it but
I really like him did I say it their
mise headphones that their mise 11 deco
yes Nino level okay I'll shut up about
that I'm sorry that was random
next they want to show you is the star
looks box star look star box which is
from May sorry really behind the times
anyway oh yes that I guess the theme is
wander the pretty model on there she's
pretty so this looks like a random
assortment so this is sorry fifteen
dollars a month for they're always full
size and it's always the star looks
brand of makeup which is professional
makeup its cruelty free which I really
like so the first thing I see in here
are these spa towels and it says the
original body lotion towelette they're
lightly scented so basically you just
use it to rub it all over your body get
some lotion all over it without you know
what this actually might be great for
traveling now that I'm thinking about
especially just like an overnight or you
don't want to bring maybe a liquid and I
don't know that's never really been that
big of an issue but that's kind of cool
I'm sure I'll use it at least once which
I'm assuming that's all you can use it
for so won't build up about ok the next
thing I see looks like an eyeliner it's
called exit to Eden and it's this really
really pretty green eyeliner which is
exciting and I see that the model and
the picture is wearing some green on her
under I you see that that's really
really pretty I've been doing that with
that blue Jordana one that I mentioned
in my may favorites but the green
actually might be really nice so I'm
excited to give that a try hey the next
thing it says gentle clear away makeup
remover that is actually awesome oh my
gosh I've never got any like thing like
this from star luck so that I will
totally use that it's in a spray bottle
it says shake it well before use spray
it onto a cotton pad and then wipe it
over your the area to be cleansed so I
can't say that I've ever used a spray
makeup cleanser for my face so sprang it
on a cotton pad in the web that's kind
of an interesting idea I'm interested I
wonder if you could also use this on
brushes though I kind of like the bottle
a lot for you brush anyway okay the
laughs I think it's less yeah the last
thing in here is much bigger it says
it's an iridescent loose powder let's
dig in shall we oh yes oh that talkin
that's pretty big it's in the shade LSP
too and it is just that it comes with a
little velour powder puff and it's got a
little bit of iridescent to it it looks
like it will do okay for my skin tone I
think we'll just have to see I can't say
that I own an iridescent loose powder
that is a lot of product in there so
that's always nice it said I love that
they do this they added up for me the
retail value for all this is forty-eight
dollars and it costs 15 so certainly
would be worth your money then again you
know starlooks products I've no I
haven't try to make up front of theirs
that I didn't like that's what i will
say um but again you have to keep in
mind you're only getting their brand
you're not gonna get any other brands of
things so if that's not something you'd
be into you wouldn't like this box if
you are into it then you would so that
is something to keep in mind alright few
more things so I was just sent more
brushes to review which I'm excited
about because you guys need to know that
before I ever did you tube and even when
i first set out i really only use like
Alf brushes and guess what I still kind
of really only use elf brushes except
for also my diva beauty brushes that you
guys know I love and you should know
that I'm not an affiliate for them like
I just want the brushes and I know some
of you guys like some people might make
a favorite they're like oh my gosh that
was just a commercial for your legs I'm
like huh I was like I'm not an affiliate
for like any of those people I don't get
anything out of them the only thing like
you might get referral credit like anjo
look I know I can get referral credit
but other than that I was like I was
kind of a fetid I'm like first of all I
would hope that you have a little more
faith in me that I'm not just gonna say
good things about a product just because
I could I don't get paid for like a
tease place let's be real even Sigma an
affiliate I've made like five dollars
from sigma 1 it's Comic Con like you
guys I feel like some people just don't
understand that would never be worth it
and the only thing a man has is his word
and I will always be true to my word
with you guys so that being said I
usually put links below just so you guys
can find things not because it's an
affiliate Lee not because of you know
any other reason most of the time it's
just because I mentioned it and I want
you guys to be able to find it like
should I just not put links for anything
I was talking
winter-like sure just not put links for
any of the products i mentioned cuz
sometimes you guys want to find it I'm
like I don't know it's not Larry odd I
was like sheesh anyway so diva beauty
they sent me the rest of the brushes of
theirs that I don't own and I am very
excited because you guys know how much I
love them now I already owns a contour
kit and the basic I kit they sent me
their other eye kit which are these four
brushes here that are kind of more
synthetic and different shapes and a
little bit thicker and then they also
sent me all of their life buffing type
rushes similar to Sigma sets all the
same shapes that got the flat top the
angled one the that's kind of a flattop
angled 12 and then around it once so
really excited to dig into these more in
depth I think I'm just gonna do at some
point maybe a separate video just on all
of the diva beauty brushes and how I
feel about them although you guys know I
love them but I will have a link below
and it's not an affiliate link so don't
kill my case and trying to help you guys
out she anyway so I really excited to
incorporate those because I love them
now I also recently did a Sedona lace a
review video on their vortex kitten they
sent me another one to try out and let
you guys know about so they sent me
their 12-piece professional makeup brush
kit in pink pink is my favorite color so
it comes with a really nice thing to
hold them in like a travel you know
brush thing and they're all in there it
comes with it looks like a powder brush
a stippling brush your blush brush and
then a ton of eye brushes like I said
I'm just showing you guys these real
quick so you know that I'll be looking
into them and trying them out but i will
do a separate review video on this one
as well but i just wanted to mention to
you guys um if you love pink this is
adorable and actually this one's cheaper
the vortex kit that i got was like i
think it was like 100 this 169 so it's a
little bit cheaper and certainly cheaper
than getting a kit with sigma all right
um I think that's everything I wanted to
show you today did it anyway like sweat
now geez least I hope that was helpful
for you guys I know it was kind of
random as a lot of different things but
certainly a lot of good info in there
and I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
