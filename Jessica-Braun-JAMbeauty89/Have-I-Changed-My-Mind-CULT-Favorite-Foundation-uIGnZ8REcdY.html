I'm not but if I was who cares got this
at Target on clearance hey guys it's
Jessica and today I'm gonna share with
you if my feelings have changed towards
a certain product I had this idea the
other day and I shared with you guys on
snapchat a lot of you guys are like yes
that sounds awesome I'm gonna be kind of
trying on today in front of the camera
the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
the classic like cult classic foundation
I tried this years and years ago when I
first started my channel and I really
didn't like it now a little bit about me
I've got typically dry skin and so
because of that this is a very full
coverage foundation can tend to be
drying and I think that's why I didn't
like it so I'm excited to try it again
the shade I'm wearing is one in two
which is a crew I'm not 100% sure that
it's a perfect match I mean obviously
this is little so we'll see we're gonna
try it anyway I actually got this for
free from octa Lee which is just a
review site and so I'm just interested
to see you have my feelings change so
I'm gonna be trying some different
things what I've been doing with more
drying foundations is I'll put on some
kind of an oil on my face and so I like
the Far Sally rose gold elixir I don't
think you need to spend this kind of
money however it is really nice and they
do have a smaller size if you were dying
to try it where it's cheaper I do think
it's really nice the Smashbox primer oil
I think is a bit cheaper and I feel like
it has the same effect so I'm gonna go
ahead and use the primer oil just
because I think it's I still don't think
it's like affordable but it's cheaper
than the Far Sally so what I've been
doing is putting this on my face and
then put them putting a moisturizer on I
tried it the other way the other day and
I need to like pull my hair back I tried
it the other way the other day and it
was absolutely horrendous I put on the
the moisturizer first then the oil no it
did not work
I already have some lip balm on if
you're like curious yeah that's what my
hair back anyway and it's the cope re
lip love I've been talking about a lot
highly highly recommend one of the best
lip balms I've ever used in my entire
life oh my gosh it like healed my lips
I'll link this below anyway alright so
we're gonna start with the primer oil
you just kind of get it up into you push
the top kind of fun packaging I feel
like a pharmacist
I don't think pharmacists do I don't
know good anyway some people kind of dot
it on their face so we can try it that
way I usually just put it on my fingers
but this is a little bit of a cleaner
method now this morning I'd already put
on like some skin care you know like a
serum I didn't put on a moisturizer yet
so I would say like when you first wake
up before you do this like this is not
really a serum where it's packed full of
amazing skincare ingredients but it is a
nice oil that really preps your skin
especially if it's dry now if you have
like oily skin I don't think you need
this step only because I'm doing it to
prevent this foundation from looking
incredibly dry so I'm gonna let that sit
on my face just for a bit it's kind of
funny because it's called a primer oil
because it does pack a lot of oily
moisture is that oily that sounded weird
oily moisture anyway um but it sinks in
really quickly if you notice like it's
it's pretty much synced in sunken
already it's still early I'm only
halfway through my coffee give you break
guys now that that's done I better shut
it cuz I will spill this everywhere I'm
gonna put on my favorite moisturizer of
the moment for before makeup application
that is the ordinary natural
moisturizing factors plus H a which is
hyaluronic acid I just really like this
stuff really inexpensive again all of
these will be linked below and it's just
a you know standard moisturizer I'm
gonna put on again a little bit more
than I do if I'm putting on like a BB
cream because that itself is super
moisturizing but I'm just trying to
extra moisturize my face I like doing
this all the time anyway I mean just cuz
I like my face to have that fresh glow
underneath and I feel like the oils have
really been giving me that the past
month and it's just like I feel like I'm
late
- the oil primer oil kind of train but
I'm really a surprised how how nice it
makes my skin look and I think you'd be
surprised to just give it a try because
I kind of was like no I just want to use
regular primers but I was really
surprised so what that means is I'm not
gonna be using another primer now I
could totally at this juncture put on
another primer but I really just want to
see how does this foundation look like
this because on a normal day I would
kind of treat these together as my
primer if you have enlarged pores you
might want to put something like
especially here some kind of pore
filling one the NYX pore filler is
pretty good for that I want to say
that's inexpensive but I feel like their
primers now are like frickin $15 so I'm
like no but I'll linkable it's still a
really good one and it's cheap compared
to other ones but I don't know but I do
half my face with my favorite blender
the L'Oreal infallible one and I wet it
but then I like literally ring it
between a clean washcloth because I I
want it to be moist but I don't want it
to be too much you know that can really
sheer out the other side I'm gonna do
with my Clarisonic foundation brush I've
only been using this for a little while
now and I laughs I can't use on my nose
cuz you turn it on and you put it on
your note uh-huh no and it tickles so
much I don't know how anyone does it I
was laughing so hard I thought well
maybe I'll just turn it off and do it
and that was a little bit better but it
literally I bet I can make myself sneeze
just watch huh here comes I thought me
and if I ever like need to cease I'm
just gonna go grab this turn it on and
just let it rip on my nose it just
tickles so much so I can't handle it -
it's really sensitive so if you have a
sensitive nose I'm gonna sneeze again
you can't use it on your nose when it's
on it's hilarious I don't know why it
makes me laugh so much but it just does
okay so but I am gonna use that on half
of my face and I'll use this and then I
might turn it off for this side a minute
I don't know
so I feel like my skin is very
moisturized I do have a couple breakouts
to cover so I'm just curious how this
will work and I even have one here and
like an old one there so we'll see we'll
see if it covers so it does not have a
pump I know that you can buy like Mac
pumps fit this and when I first had it I
think either you guys sent one to me or
I bought one a Mac pump and it did fit
but then I got rid of it said like it so
that was a waste of money anyway um so I
hate oh Jessica come on now the boss is
already dirty alright let's see we'll do
this side first yeah I think it is a
little dark for men it might work
we're just gonna see to be honest in
real life I usually like pour this onto
my this might be too much I don't know
um I gotta snacks again hold on why do I
do that alright so on this side I'm
gonna use the brush I'm so curious how
it looks I'm just hoping that my dry
skin does not pop through so this is I
was I thought I wouldn't like this to be
quite candid with you it's funny because
I went and bought the foundation brush
head during the Sephora vib sale and
then I literally got a PR package from
them in the mail before I even got this
the force so this holder is actually
from the PR package but I had bought the
foundation brushes so anyway I'm just so
curious cuz I know a lot of youtubers
just ask the Hawks why did I do let me
turn it off and do my nose I don't know
so what I'm noticing is it I mean it's
definitely more perfected there's no
doubt about that that compared to that
it actually is a decent color for me
good job I think it's a little darker
but you can still see some moisture in
my skin which I appreciate don't you
feel like you can still see a little
glow which I did not feel like that was
the case before so I wonder if it's just
the way I applied it do I think it's
completely flawless maybe let's try the
other side at the blender I have a
feeling using a sponge usually kind of
sheers it out a little bit more so this
time I am just doing it on my
I'm just gonna dot it on it usually does
it depends this sponge though the reason
I like it is cuz I don't feel like it
shears it out as much I feel like
there's almost like a shield on this
bottom and like it doesn't soak up a ton
of product which is why I like it ooh
okay
did you guys see it covered those pretty
well I can still see a little redness
but not a lot that was pretty amazing
actually not every foundation does that
that's for sure come back to my nose so
hmm again I really feel like I can still
see the glow in my skin and its really
surprising me I think it's the
combination of that primer oil but
that's gonna have to be the key for you
if you have dry skin and you either
already own it or you're really wanting
to splurge and get a really nice
foundation that's got really nice
coverage yeah this is a little dark for
me the ring light kind of washes it out
but in real life like looking at it it
probably could have gone a shade lighter
but the reality is I might be between
shades you know what I mean because I
feel like I remember I think the shade I
originally had a long time ago was the
one just below this and I it was like
two lights so maybe I'd rather have this
then I don't know I could always lighten
it with another foundation so I kind of
just blended my nose because I don't
think the brush did a great job since I
couldn't have it on so verdict is let me
just see here I'm kind of amazed I was
ready to not like this I feel like
there's a little like I just have
texture here part of it is like kind of
you know pre wrinkles part of it is just
like I have like a kind of like a
freckle like a race know kind of like a
mole but it's not a moment you know what
I mean
so I have I've always had weirdness here
and I can definitely still see that so I
don't think this is like perfect but to
be honest with you I feel like the only
way you can make this work with dry skin
is to have that kind of a base
underneath it you know I've still got a
little dryness near these things and you
can still see a little bit of redness
you could always cover it with concealer
I've not ever really found a foundation
other than really thick foundations that
will cover that kind of stuff at one
pass so I can always layer more on to it
actually yeah that actually did cover
pretty well so you could layer more on
to it but I have like a little bit of
peeling skin on this breakout and you
can see that duh it's peeling skin I
don't know really I mean this is the PR
product so I'm always honest with you
guys and I don't ever want you to feel
like oh well this time she got in PR so
she well it's not really PR I guess it's
oxalate reviewing but it might as well
be PR so I never want you guys to feel
like oh well last time she paid for it
she didn't like it and this time she got
it for PR and she did like it I'm always
trying to be honest and clear with you
guys this is something that I think had
I run out of it I would try it again
because you know what this doesn't have
SPF I'm double-checking so it's gonna
look amazing in flash photography it
covers really well but let me compare it
to something that I used to wear for
like special events so in my youtube
career I've only gone to a couple of
events and when I have I've always worn
my hourglass vanish stick
it's got great coverage but here's the
deal this can look really dry and that's
why I don't wear it everyday in real
life it can look really flawless but the
difference is this might now replace
that because as I look at it it it looks
just as flawless but it looks like my
skin is just healthy it doesn't look
like it's plastered on which again I
think is more attributed to the steps I
took before I put it on not necessarily
the foundation on its own the other day
I put on this foundation on its own just
to preliminary ly try it and I kind of
realized that you know it definitely has
high coverage but it just doesn't make
my skin look healthy so I think that's
I've changed my mind on it and I'm
excited now I do want to get a pump so
it's just easier to use but I'm excited
that I tried it again because this is
one of those things that so many people
love makeup artists love to and I'm like
why but they were probably doing those
really moisturizing steps before it so
that it looks
nice throughout the day so I'm gonna do
some check-in start the day so you can
see how it wears I'm gonna film a couple
more videos get some stuff done around
the house it's kind of a rainy day and I
think we're staying in which is my
favorite kind of a day but I will check
in throughout the day and we'll see how
it looks at the end of the night as well
so you can see how does it where they're
not the day cuz that's the other thing
it can look great when you first apply
it but if it looks terrible four hours
into your workday then who cares because
it looks terrible now okay it is 209
p.m. and I'm checking in let's see so
you can see really clearly now like that
bit of texture but it's probably been on
for over four hours now you can already
see the redness back through on those
brake breakouts so I feel like if you
really had acne or anything that you
really wanted to cover up you'd probably
need something beyond just the
foundation you'd need concealer cover up
and then like a setting powder on top of
it to really keep it in place
I think this wore off because I was
eating and so I wiped my mouth and it's
right by it
but like this there's not really an
excuse for why it wore off so I think
it's just the foundation has good
coverage but if it's like truly a red
mark then you're gonna need like
concealer and stuff but otherwise I feel
like I've been filming then we went down
we made lunch we ate it I've been
playing with puppies and rubbing my face
all in their cute fur and I feel like
it's held up pretty darn well I do think
it is a little bit darker than my skin
tone really like you can kind of clearly
see it here I might exchange it I don't
know I don't think it's enough that it
really bothers me especially like it's
winter since the palest I am but the
other half of the year I don't know
we'll see so but so far we're wise I
think it's doing a good job even on my
nose my nose is usually super red by now
and this is looking pretty nice we'll
check in again in a little while all
right it is 9:50 - I'm about to wash my
makeup off and I do feel like a little
of my oil I got I shadow glittery eye
shadow accidentally on my forehead from
a swatch so that's what that is but you
can see a little bit of my natural oil
breaking through just a little bit
and I've wiped off lipstick and stuff so
that's why it looks weirder on my lips
but I think it did okay you can start to
see a little bit of redness on my nose
so it is breaking down a bit but like
looking from here especially like in
real life like I'm looking at a mirror
it actually looks really nice a lot
nicer than it does on camera but I mean
obviously it's not perfect but it is
long wearing so I was impressed with
that and how really it didn't end up
looking as dry as I thought it would
throughout the day I don't think it's
perfect but not terrible in the end I
don't remember the exact time I've got
doggies running in here oh boy oh my
gosh anyway so it wasn't perfect perfect
for as long as it was on but I think it
was pretty good
I think if I started doing like pore
filling primers it might hold on to more
but then it might also look too right
okay I had to go and play with some dogs
but if you did enjoy I hope that you'll
subscribe before you guys leave and I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
