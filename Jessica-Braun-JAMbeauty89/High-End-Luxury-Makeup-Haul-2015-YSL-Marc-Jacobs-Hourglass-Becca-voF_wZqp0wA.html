Valentine's II and like lovey but I
thought you know what like I've been

don't know I just wanted to stray away

Christmastime I literally made a couple
hundred dollars because I was online
shopping anyway for Christmas gifts and
birthday gifts and all kinds of things
and as long as I did it through Ebates I
was getting like 10% cash back or eight
percent cash back and it just added up
so quickly and so in my PayPal account a
couple months later I had a couple
hundred dollars just from Christmas
shopping so it is amazing oh thank god
it is truly amazing so I will shut up
about that check below for info on all
of that stuff let's go ahead and get
into all the luxury loves of mine so one
of the first things I got this was
actually I I bought this from the Home
Shopping Network
and it was $49 and it would originally
have been $49 just for the palate but it
came with a bunch of other stuff so it
is the Too Faced better than chocolate
kit here and like I said it was $49 but
look at all that it comes with it comes
with the chocolate bar palette here
which is $49 on its own it also comes
with better than sex mascara which is
unbelievable and I would never buy it
for the price I think it's like almost
$20 on its own but I tried a trial size
I got once it was amazing but I was like
I'm not spend another 20 on a mascara
that's gonna go bad so came with it and
a two-faced lip creme lip cream which I
already have a few of these from
hautelook that I love and it's a
different shade and then it also came at
the deluxe size of the shadow insurance
which this it might be a deluxe size but
it might as well be full size because it
takes forever to go through it and I
already love this product so let me show
you guys these things up close the
chocolate bar palette is like this
unbelievable just oh my gosh first of
all it smells great which everyone talks
about and it doesn't smell like the
chocolate like tootsie roll fake
chocolate it smells just sweet I don't
think it's totally a chocolate smell
just smells sweet and the colors I don't
know it was one of those palettes that
I'd gone back and forth with on getting
for a long time but I really thought
about now it's like you know what these
matte colors here I will use the crap
out of and then these really odd colors
I
this blue one and this one here they're
beautiful in the outer corner just to
add a little bit of dimension to your
look they're gorgeous on the lower lash
I mean there's so many looks you can do
with this and for me as a traveler I
would use this and it would be kind of
one of those palettes that I could bring
and really not need anything else like I
don't need to bring another one single
shadow to fill in the gaps this really
covers everything so love this could not
believe how much I loved it and I've
done a few looks with it like for work
this week and I just love the way it
where is it did not budge and I used
that in tandem with the or in
conjunction with the shadow insurance
primer which I actually have a full
sized one that I'm using right now it
really is good there are a lot of
drugstore ones that are just as good
this one I just pulled out the wet and
wild by Fergie one is just as good I
really feel like they're the same I've
talked about that a few times so if you
don't want to splurge on that this is
it's the same thing it's really good the
mascara is first of all the packaging is
adorable is that really pretty light
pink I don't want to open it yet because
I don't want us to dry out before I'm
like ready to use it I'm using up a few
mascaras but it's got this really really
fluffy big wand and fluffy is the way I
would describe this mascara it makes
your lashes look like velvet like velour
lashes not like the name brand of lashes
but just velvety and plush and just
beautiful I don't I've never tried a
drugstore mascara that does what this
does now I love my L'Oreal voluminous
that's what I'm wearing today that's
what I love but this one is amazing it's
just different it's amazing so I can't
wait to pull that one out
I have a feeling this might be the
mascara I wear on my wedding because I'm
I might wear lashes I don't know I'm
doing my own makeup but if I didn't I'm
just excited now the lip cream I love
again the packaging of all of their
products this is in the shade nude beach
and it really is a true nude color and
it's just so it's like butter it really
is they remind me of the lipstick I'm
wearing today the formula that I will
tell you what it is in a second I in
love so for $49 getting all this it's
like an oh really it really truly is
over $100 value and I don't think
they're offering it now but I think they
still might have
this kit on HSN's website and it's like
it's just a little bit in Finnish
shattered I won't throw up it's a good
thing about bulletproof packaging now on
to the even higher-end things that I got
so one of the things I finally bought
and I'm wearing out my eyes today if
you're curious is this Marc Jacobs
palette and it's there it's called 206
the Lolita and I had seen so many people
talk about this palette and I'd looked
at swatches for a million years and I
kept putting it my car and then removing
it from my cart then moving it to love's
then putting in my cart and then
removing it Ritter I kept going back and
forth but finally I did it oh my gosh I
just love the look this gift I love the
look this gives and it lasts all day it
blends impeccably the only downside
because this is expensive is this middle
color here which is a really shimmery
color has fall out like freaking you
wouldn't believe like I you can't use it
and it's so pretty but you can't use it
there's fall out everywhere and it's
like instant fallout like there's
falling on me right now
Fall Out Boy everywhere so that is the
downside but everything else is so
unbelievably beautiful I love this and
if you're wanting to treat yourself to
something luxurious I love this palette
and I love the formula now would I go
out and buy a bunch of these because
they have you know a few different color
ranges no because you know I don't think
that the shadows are any better than wet
wild I mean I like cuz when wild are
awesome that's not me what wild is
awesome these are awesome but I just
think it's just so luxurious and I feel
gorgeous putting it on this again might
be something similar that I do for our
wedding I don't know yeah I'm so oh my
gosh I'm experimenting like crazy but I
am curious about what you guys would
recommend for you know I don't know III
haven't decided on my blush or my
lipstick or what I should I mean I'm so
torn because I there's so many things I
love so let me know what your
recommendations would be because our
receptions
side and it's in June so you know
sweat-proof things would be great next
thing okay I finally got the hourglass
ambient lighting palette now in the past
I had bought a single one of their
ambient lighting powders and I got it in
diffused light and I was not impressed
with that one and I just didn't get why
I'm so expensive this is only like I
don't know I can't remember the prices
but the actual regular full-size powder
is only like ten dollars cheaper than
this entire palette why didn't I just
buy the palette but I needed up
returning that and not doing it just
because I was turned off well i swatched
these and i was like oh my god so I
bought them I'm wearing them today I'm
wearing the this one here which I think
this is dim light all over my face and
then the middle one which is
incandescent light as my highlight I
didn't use the more bronzy shade
although sometimes I'll kind of put that
on top of my blush just as a little more
dimension but it's awesome you guys I
get it I get I get it and here's the
thing if you're one if you're on a
budget I mean I'm on a budget but if
you're not wanting to treat yourself
right now this wet-and-wild color icon
bronzer and reserve your Cabana I swear
to you I want to compare is just as good
as the what is it call again I cannot
remember the name as the dim lights so
which one is which okay this is the dim
like one and this is the wet-and-wild
reserve your Cabana I don't know how
well this will swatch but let's just see
so dim light is on top yeah you can't
really tell I'm telling you guys there
other than there's a little bit of a
shade difference they're the same like
formula they do the same transforming
beautiful effect on your skin where you
look kind of almost candle lit if you
know what I mean it's just beautiful
I really I really feel like this is a
dupe for it other than the fact that
obviously the shade but formula wise
they're both gorgeous you don't have to
spend the money however I really do love
this I probably will wear that on my
wedding day okay next thing I actually
saved a lot of money on this one this
one I bought on HauteLook and it's a
becca product they had becca on there
and I was what of course I didn't have
like their the really famous powders
right now that are out the highlight
whatever but they had some eyeshadow
quads I got some lip products that I'm
not showing because I really am not that
impressed with but this quad is in
what's it called this in Eclipse and
it's got these four shadows
three well I would say one of them is
matte the other two are satin and then
this one's more of a shimmer this is the
most beautiful cool toned look I've ever
done like and the shadows are great I
just love this let me swatch a few for
you just so you can get an idea they're
just beautiful and they're it's just
such a pretty it's just such a pretty
quad the colors together make a really
really pretty look it stays all day and
I want to say it was this ended up being
like ten or twelve dollars on HauteLook
and I'm sure originally is in the 30s if
not even higher so awesome so check out
if you well if you love hope look I like
I do you check it every day I just
bought some Illamasqua products on there
and what else was just on there Chella
is that how it's said or Kelly I don't
know how to say it that was on there so
I brought some bought some new migrant
products for really cheap it's amazing
so was very impressed with that and I
love it
this one I got from Birchbox points it's
the dr. jart BB bomb and I've heard a
lot of good things this is the
multi-action skincare plus makeup with
SPF 45 and I got it in why can I hold
onto anything I don't know what shade I
got it in I'm what I would have bought
it in the lightest shade I don't see
maybe there is no shade regardless this
is really nice I'm actually wearing it
today and it's a BB cream and it gives
really nice coverage and it kind of
neutrals your skin I love it and it
doesn't look greasy and oh my gosh it is
expensive but I'm really glad I bought
it because this is one that I think will
be great when I'm vacationing like in a
beachy location where I want something
on my face but I don't want to look like
gross it's beautiful now again a
drugstore one that I like that I think
is similar I don't think they're dupes
by any means but that I also really
really have fallen in love with is the
NYC BB
cream if you want to see this on my face
I have a video of me applying this one
in and elf one and comparing them but
this one is matte similar to this one is
they're really really pretty and this
one's like three ninety-nine one thing
before I get to the next few things
which are some lip products they're
really high in I was just thinking I was
looking at like the packaging for these
things that I got and I had been saving
them and it wasn't I wasn't saving them
for the video but I wanted to share this
with you guys because I wonder if you
guys do it too I was saving the
packaging so like oh it's so pretty and
some of the other products I'm showing
you some why so I'm like oh I want to
save this packaging it's so cute
but I realized like why am i saving it
like I feel like I do this all the time
and since I'm decluttering right now and
of course I'm buying more things as well
but I'm doing muttering at least getting
rid of things that I'm not using and not
loving why would I keep packaging just
because it's pretty if I know I'm not
gonna return it which I'm not gonna
return these I was keeping it just to
look at and why because in about you
know a few weeks or whatever I'll
finally throw em away why not just nip
it in the bud throw moy now but I'm not
the type I know a lot of people keep
their products in their actual packaging
it's not me that's not what I do so for
me it makes no sense so I wanted to
share that with you guys because that's
like a kind of a dumb struggle of mine
but it is one that you know I need to
get better about like why am i why I
keep it why so that was totally off
topic but I look next few things are why
I sell products now the lip products you
know you see them in makeup collection
videos and I'm like what like why are
they so expensive
they're so beautiful but I mean they
better be amazing you guys the one I'm
wearing on my lips these are sorry just
so you know it's why I sell which is
Yves Saint Laurent and it's their Rouge
beloved and this is in the shade 29
which is the one I'm wearing today and
it's just this really nice pink color
and I just love how they like oh my gosh
they like melt into your skin it's
unlike any lip product I've really ever
used the only one that would compare is
the Too Faced la creme lipsticks because
they are also kind of slidy
but these are even better because while
they're kind of slighty and melty they
don't slide outside of your lip line why
I'm wearing a lip liner today but
whether you're wearing one or not they
just they're beautiful and they stay on
for so long which makes no sense because
they're not like a stain I had worn I
was wearing the other one of these that
I'll show you in a second to school and
it lasted I was drinking coffee in the
morning and there never was a weird ring
around my lip like it lasted for a very
long time I was so impressed and that's
one of those things that I'm like okay
see that makes it worth the price if
it's this you know it's an amazing
formula it lasts all day that makes it
worth it to me now if it were crummy I
would have been very upset the other
shade in that same Rouge Phillips line I
got was number one just because I figure
number one it just sounds like classic
and it's a little more nude E and a
little more kind of peach tone now this
one it looks a little darker on my hand
but on my lips my I do have kind of
pigmented lips so it kind of mutes them
out a little more which is not my
favorite but it still really does look
beautiful and after it sits on your lips
for about a minute and this is the case
with both of these they just start to
look even more beautiful it looks like
it's just a part of your lips wow it is
beautiful so number one and number 29 I
really liked both eye I want to get more
but I'm I want to get more but I'm
obviously don't need to right now but I
love them the other thing I got was this
YSL rouge pur Couture Wow I'm sorry I
can't speak French but it's one of their
lip gloss type things kind of and it's
in the shade 19 and they have names
online that go along with the numbers
but then on the packaging it's only the
numbers so just keep that in mind that's
why I'm only telling you numbers so this
is like a very neutral light peach or
pink whatever you call it
gloss and it's got one of the doe foot
applicator x' that are kind of the weird
I don't really like ones like this to be
completely honest with you but this was
very odd cuz when i first effect melissa
was like what is this formula it's so
weird but it kind of like again melts it
into my skin in such a way that after a
minute the first minute it really
crazy it looks like shrieky and weird
but after a minute I looked back in the
mirror and I was like whoa like my lips
looked so healthy and gorgeous I don't
know how to describe it I don't know
what it did I don't know but my lips
look natural but still like um glassy
but not too glossy and it certainly
isn't sticky oh my gosh I don't even
know how to describe this stuff but it
was just weird and cool and amazing so
those were all of the products that I
got that recently that are high-end I
have a few other ones that are high-end
but you know not they've had them for a
while now I'm thinking about doing like
a products worth the splurge or worth
the money let me know if you'd be
interested in that because I do have a
decent amount of other not a ton but I
do have a decent amount of other
high-end products not necessarily as
high-end as YSL but even just the ones
like gosh lorac Too Faced those are all
expensive brands really when you really
think about it so I was thinking about
doing a video of just my favorites that
really I think are worth the money that
I don't think there is a drugstore
counterpart for let me know by giving us
a thumbs up if you'd be interested in
that kind of a video cuz I think it'd be
fun but you know I keep in mind that my
channel really is based around the
drugstore that is my love that's not
gonna change
but I do like trying out these other
things because I feel like I deserve a
treat everyone smile and plus I know
some of you guys are curious about some
of these things hopefully that video was
helpful if you're interested in more of
my hauls especially my more drum store
friendly hauls I will link the playlist
for all my hauls down below and I will
catch you guys in my next video
bye and then they also have this size so
they're like longer and thinner and they
are a dollar and every time I see them
I've gone to many different ones around
me I buy all that they have because they
always only have like three or four
laughing like haha so
you know not all of them but so far I
have about all that they have suppose
anyway they are amazing so that is quite
a fine because those can get really
pricey depending on where you go so
that's cool so into the manga I'm so
excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
