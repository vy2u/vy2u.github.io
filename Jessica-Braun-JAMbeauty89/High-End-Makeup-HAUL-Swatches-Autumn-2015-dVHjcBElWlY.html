absolutely humongous probably the
biggest one I've done on my channel
high-end haul now most of this stuff I
bought however there were a few things
and I'll throw those things in at the
end that were sent to me from companies
they're sent to me for free from
different like from Influenster which
anyone can join but I'll put those at
the ends so if you're totally not
interested in that you know that's fine
whatever those things that I will show
at the end none of this is sponsored I'm
not getting paid for any of this
things that are sent to me for free are
basically for PR purposes and what I
mean by that is that companies can send
them to me and I tell them that you know
feel free to send them to me but I'm not
guaranteeing that I'll show them on my
channel review them anything so there's
no strings attached I can do whatever I
want with them show them or not so I'm
choosing to share them with you guys
let's go ahead and get into the hall
so the most recent thing that I've
bought and this is this was very
expensive it was a splurge II idea but I
was like you know what I'm like two
months into the school year I just feel
like splurging on a luxury item and this
was brand new out it is the hourglass
ambient lighting edit and this is this
sick shade palette where it's got three
highlighting shades and three kind of
blushy bronzy shades these are their
ambient powders and those are basically
kind of like these glowy light infused
powders and some of them are more light
so they'd be highlighting shade some are
bronzy and some are more of a pink or a
rosy tone which would be more of a blush
shade I'm wearing some of these today
I'm actually wearing this kind of
pinkish tone right here which is called
luminous flush and it's one of their
ambient lighting blushes and it's just
this really pretty pinkish tone blush
eye you can actually be pretty
heavy-handed with this so I had to blend
it out a few times but it's so beautiful
and then I'm wearing
this lighter kind of white shade which
is called
diffused light I'm wearing that kind of
right above on my upper cheekbone I'm
also I also threw on a little bit of the
dim light which I love that's in the
original palette now I will do a
separate review on this these are really
small pants I know a lot of people have
asked about that for $80 these are
really small pants however if you don't
own anything yet from them and you knew
you wanted to try a lot of different
things this is ideal but like I said
I'll do a video on that but it's a
beautiful palette it is a lot of money
so just keep that in mind if you already
know that there's like one shade that
you really just want I would say just
buy the single of that it's cheaper it's
still expensive but it's cheaper than
this you get a lot more and if you know
there's that one shade you're gonna use
then I would say just do that but it is
beautiful I'm excited that I have it but
I don't think it is for everyone
speaking of hourglass this one I bought
with my own money this one hourglass
just happened to send to me in the mail
and you need to know I was like jumping
up and down seeing a package from
hourglass in the mail I was like what
how in the world I'm so excited but
these are brown products from them and I
used it today I have been a total snob
I'll be the first a minute a total snob
with my Anasazi of brow is it's like 20
dollars which i think is expensive for a
brow pencil you guys know I'm typically
using drugstore but I do like high-end
and I do have high-end products but they
sent me their hourglass brow sculpting
pencils they sent me ash and they sent
me soft brunette I'm wearing soft
brunette today here's why I love this
the actual pencil in it is kind of wax
here which that's what I kind of liked
about the honest as you want to but the
on sizing one is a really tiny pencil
this one is kind of a it reminds me of
the Rimmel lip liners that I love where
it's kind of angled and it's a lot
thicker almost like a triangle shape it
is triangularly shaped but it makes it
really easy to just go Shoom Shoom Shoom
Shoom Shoom
and the whole thing is done whereas with
the honest
see when I feel like I was constantly
like filling in and then I brush it
through be like oh no there's this big
gap fill that and it takes a while
whereas this I could do really broad
strokes and it just brushes through the
whole thing and it's done and it has
totally I've had this really I've been
using it all week
these have completely like my entire
routine in the morning is so much
quicker because I feel like my brows
always take way too long from what they
are this has made it so much faster so
I'm very thankful stop brunette works
really well action Sabrina are really
close for me I could probably use them
interchangeably but I really like both
of them and I should probably mention
that the other side has a really nice
fluffy spoolie which makes it really
easy to brush through your brows and
even it out the next things that I
purchased were their bare minerals
products but I bought them on Vitacost
fighting cross is one of my favorites
because will order like olive oil from
there maple syrup like a lot of organic
or at least more pure things on there
are so much cheaper than when I buy them
at like Whole Foods or Trader Joe's so
whole just plays big orders on there
every other month so while we were
placing our order for some spices and
some other things I saw that bare
minerals is on there and I was like oh
my gosh so I wouldn't have in place
order because there was a lot that I was
wanting to try because I tried some bare
minerals things like I really like
they're well rested mineral concealer
it's amazing at brightening the under
eyes so I wanted to try some more so I
got a couple of their blushes I got the
this is their ready blush that means
they're ready line or products that are
they're not um they're not loose they're
like pressed so this is their blush in
the shade the one and it's just this
really nice light peachy pink color I
think it's perfect for every day and
never even if you use a heavy hand it
doesn't look like too much so I really
have liked this so far I've only worn it
like once or twice and then this one
I've worn a little bit more this is
called the natural high it makes me
think of NARS blush and orgasm it's got
it's again kind of a peachy pink but
it's a lot more punchy and
using that word punchy but it does have
a lot more of that like kind of golden
glitter to it which i think is so pretty
you don't need a highlighter with it
which is nice it's kind of a one-step
blush if you will I'm really impressed
with the wear time of these for both of
them I put them on in the morning you
know and by the end of the day they were
so on and they looked exactly like they
did when I put them on so I think that
is a big deal and when you're paying
more for a blush they better last all
day because if they are not lasting all
day and you spent over $20 for it then
why did you spend that money because it
didn't last so these were worth the
price tag when it comes to wear time now
before I get deeper into the
bareMinerals one other thing I got my
Vitacost that I felt like mentioning
because I love this brand this brand is
called everyday minerals and I feel like
I never hear about them there are a few
channels I follow that are Vitacost
obsessed like I am and they like this
stuff too
this is their cheek product this is
their blush and tea rose this is a loose
powder I have their blush in I got a
share because I love it this is why I
bought this second one their blush and
Crimmins which is this beautiful light
kind of kind of a warmer light pink this
one is a cooler pink and it's in the
shade T Rose I think I already said that
but it's just this really pretty blush
that like I said it is cool tone but it
lasts all day these might be the longest
lasting blushes these mineral blushes
I've ever worn they are so soft on the
skin and they just look perfect like it
doesn't matter if you screw up where you
placed it somehow they always look
perfect and they Ladas all day and
they're not sure but they have this look
to them that makes it just look like
natural and maybe that's because there
are these mineral loose blushes but
something about them is so gorgeous so
gorgeous I can't recommend them highly
enough so I will link both of these
shades below because but back to bare
minerals so I also got an eyeshadow quad
which I have to admit I'm not that
impressed with its the quad and the
happy
now these are colors i they're totally
up my alley there's like a medium brown
and like a cream and then there's like
this really pretty kind of coppery
orange and then this like aubergine kind
of color can eggplant eggplant color can
I say that word right I don't know um
they're beautiful they swatch really
beautifully as you paint like I feel
like they didn't blend as well as I'd
hope so when I put them on I try and
blend them together and it would just
look like a stripe I'm wearing I wore
this one today in my crease just to kind
of get an idea and make sure I wasn't
crazy but it just feels kind of splotchy
um I ended up using like a two-faced
naturalised palette instead like in
addition to it but I just wasn't that
impressed
I had another bareMinerals palette i dot
red i recently declared it for the same
reason I was like maybe it was just that
one so I got this one still not
impressed I might return it I don't know
I might pass it on to my sister I might
try it a couple more times but wasn't
that impressive you guys this video is
going to be so long I'm letting I'm
looking at what I still have to do so if
you're like oh this song's just click
out but if you're all about it then I
got in this lip gloss it's their
marvelous Moxie I have been very
impressed with their lip products very
impressed this one is in the shade
smooth-talker and it is a very shimmery
color but it's a nice like light pink
but it's got a little bit more depth to
it so it doesn't look like Barbie pink I
love this and these feel very kind of
minty on the lips I on the verge of
tingly but if you don't mind that then
you'll love it I love it angling lips it
makes me feel like I don't know it just
makes me feel good so but this color
this light pink color is so beautiful
and if you like shimmer it really does
have a peach shimmer to it I think it's
beautiful I really really like this now
I did get to bareMinerals lipstick I had
one lipstick in um be free and I know I
think I got it like whip see points a
long time again it's a really nude color
I'll kind of swatch it here well it's
not that nude but yes it is my lips are
really really pigmented so this color
me like washes them out which I know
when you look at you're like how does
that but it really did but I loved the
formula and I thought the packaging is
really cool cuz you kind of pop it out
and it's I don't know there's something
about it I really like this is in the
shade raise the bar this is a very
pearly or lustrous color and it is
deeper I think it's gonna be so
beautiful in the fall I will say I
looked up swatches of these and I don't
know it didn't quite look the same
online I mean it never does but we're
gonna see because I don't this is not
typically a color I would go for so I'm
gonna try it out we're gonna see this is
me trying things out this one however is
and I have worn this like almost every
day this week
it's called speak your mind and it's
kind of a cream color this is this
perfect wearable pink that it's not so
mommy and 90s that you can't really wear
it and feel normal but it's not so white
if you like Barbies so it's the perfect
I love it so much and again this in the
shade speak your mind anyway I
absolutely adore it I think it is so
beautiful so these are the three shades
I have in these marvelous Moxie lipstick
so I think they're all so pretty now the
last bareMinerals thing I got was their
bare skin foundation this is their cute
well it's called their pure brightening
serum foundation SPF of 20 I got in bare
ivory just because it looked a little
more yellow I'm not wearing this today
I've got these breakouts here and I want
to I'm wondering if it was from this
because this is the only thing I've kind
of switched up on my face other than
like blush and stuff but I would have
had blush down here and it's not
hormonal so I don't know I've only tried
it twice and that's when I started
breaking out so I have to assume I'm
gonna wait till this clears up a little
bit and I'm gonna try it again with take
one for the team because if this is
breaking me out it's gonna break you out
again
but it's interesting you do you know you
have to shake it up and you it is like
more like it's liquidy like a serum so
it had decent hard are called like
medium coverage I had to put
more than one layer and it was nice but
I really have not formed a very strong
opinion because I had to stop using it
so I'll try it again we're gonna see if
it's this or maybe it is something else
I don't know but the color was actually
pretty nice bear ivory 0 4 was pretty
nice because I do have more of a yellow
tone I'm getting better in determining
my skin tone so alright moving forward
homeland I got 5 to face products from
whole look and if you don't know what
whole look is I almost don't want to
tell you about it because I have spent
so much money on that website now you
see like it's a bunch of high-end makeup
and like clothes department store brand
clothes and and some furniture I've
bought a lot of furniture on there as
well for our apartment here but it's
like 50% off so I don't feel as bad
spending money on there but when I'm
spending when I'm buying all kinds of
stuff I mean I might as well be spending
as much money but to face was on there
recently and actually urban decay was
just on there and I it's like a flash
sale so it'll be on for like four days
and then it'll be gone for a while and
then I'll come back on but to face was
on there and I bought five different
things so the first thing I bought was
the Too Faced bronze and poreless I've
worn it a bit I actually got this I want
ordered it in July you get it like weeks
later it does take a while to get there
so as long as you're patient you'll be
fine
but I've worn this a few times every
time I've worn it I have not I in fact
I've hated the way it has looked like
used it up here and it looked kind of as
a sort of contour bronzer shade I do not
like it so this I might pass on to my
sister she's a little more fair than I
am I think she'll like it better than I
but again at least I paid 50% off so I
didn't pay full price thank goodness um
another thing I got is the Too Faced
radiant glow face powder these are these
little beads and I see these on like
people post you know those beautiful
artsy photos of makeup on Instagram then
I you see these all the time visited
these little heart shaped beads and I'm
always like oh it's so cute but when it
was half off
I was like duh so you know you kind of
swirl your brush in it and you get this
kind of glowy shade right there and it
really is it's a beautiful highlight I
haven't used it enough yet but I do have
the you know it's kind of a sorry I know
my drawers are squeaky when I was in
Paris for our honeymoon I got the girl
on meteorites which are like little you
know powdery beads this is the more
these this is a lighter shape and this
is but they do sell more of a medium
shade but these are it really is
beautiful so I was so excited to get
this for half off I also got two of
their soulmates little duo's I got Ross
and Rachel which is kind of a deeper
look versus the carrying bag so I've got
Carrie and big over here and Ross and
Rachel over here the rasa Rachel is more
pink whereas Carrie Vegas like peachy
and you know the I don't know these are
tricky for me to use
I've had these now for really I've had
it for a while but I wanted to show them
to you guys because I feel like I don't
know how to use these because I don't
like mixing them together because I
don't want a bronzy blush because of my
skin tone I just don't think it looks
flattering if you do the nude like these
but so then I'm just using the bronzer
but the bronzers aren't perfect for my
skin tone either and they're like the
Ross and Rachel one is a little shimmery
so I feel like there's no really great
way for me to use these so I've been
trying to use them as much as I can but
but for me I've got a lot to choose from
and these are not my first pick not even
second third or fourth pick so I don't
know I don't think I totally regret
buying them but I don't know if these
are things that I would ever like bring
with me traveling or grab first thing
when I'm getting ready in the morning
I'm like forcing myself to use these so
I'm just not impressed the most exciting
thing I think I bought on HauteLook was
this Too Faced palette you guys know to
face shadows are like my favorite ever
this is their romantic eye palette and
it's in their old packaging their new
packaging in
let me grab it I have a couple in there
new happening like the two big natural
eyes is one of my favorite palettes and
it's this kind of metal and it's just
really you know there's a mirror and
it's simple and it's not that but
they're old packaging is more like
cardboard but it's this thing I mean
it's durable cardboard it's not gonna
you know get messed up but there's no
mirror which you know that's fine now as
the shadows in the same shapes where
it's got three bigger ones and then six
smaller ones this is their romantic eye
palette and it is so beautiful and it
was so I don't remember exactly how much
but I want to say it was like 17 or 18
dollars which the Loreal palettes like
they're their new palettes that they
have those were like $20 when I bought
them I didn't get them on sale or
anything like that so I mean I paid
about the same price for this one and
this one is so much better and you guys
know I love the Loreal palette number
one but this is amazing they've got
these beautiful shades I really like
this shake honeymoon here which is like
this kind of yellowy greenish golden
shade and I mean their shadows are
unbelievable look at that so very
excited about this purchase here another
product I actually bought on the
Birchbox website everyone smell they'll
have like really good deals where like
if you buy $25 and benefit products you
can get this free gift or you know
whatever sort of like support us but I
always look on Birchbox as well and I
bought this benefit puff off and it's
supposed to it's so kitschy
it's got this little iron thing which is
adorable and the idea is that you're
kind of you know ironing your eyes it's
busting it's really cooling and it is
and it's got this kind of pinkish tone
gel but it's not it doesn't stay that
tone it's more like a lotion and it
really is it doesn't you know it doesn't
have any coverage at all but it's
supposed to feel good it's supposed to
ease the puffiness under your eyes this
is not going to do the trick if you have
severe bags under your eyes
it was just cute I mean I'll probably
use it for a while longer and you know
when they're those mornings or maybe I
didn't get a lot of sleep I've been
using it it feels good it feels kind of
tingly but in a good
I kind of like that feel but I don't
think this is a product that you need at
all it's not really doing anything
fantastic
so a few things that were sent to me I
know I mentioned already the hourglass
ones that I said I would mention them at
the end but I was already talking about
hourglass so I just did it so give me
grief if you want these why I saw once
were sent to me from Influenster and it
wasn't because I mean it's it helps I'm
a youtuber but anyone can join that
website and I don't get anything if you
join or anything I'm just gonna link the
regular site below but they you know you
link your Facebook Instagram and YouTube
and the more influence you have the more
likely your you are to get free boxes of
you know could be pet stuff or if you're
getting married they'll have wedding
boxes things like that so these I'm you
know more apt to get Beauty things of
course given that I have a beauty
channel but you take surveys and things
like that you review products you get
more influence points etc well I ain't
got chosen for this YSL box and like I
think they chose one or two thousand
people for it
this is ridiculous because these are so
expensive these are their Rouge pur
Couture different two different
lipsticks one is in the shade 0-9 and I
saved the box cuz the name is on the box
but not on the actual lipstick so this
is number nine is in row stiletto and
this is like this gorgeous really a
deeper rose color which I think I might
have one or two shades like this in my
collection but these are so creamy so
pigmented I mean it's YSL they're known
for their lipsticks so not only is the
packaging beautiful but the actual
formula is amazing so very excited about
this this one is in the shade 19 which
is fuchsia
it's just called fuchsia and it is what
I'm wearing on my lips
in fact in person it is a lot brighter
than its coming across on camera but
I'll swatch it as well it's just this
gorgeous bright pink shade now again
this is not something I would wear
everyday whereas the roast Aletta one I
would be way more out to wear out but I
do love them
so much they're so gorgeous they're so
pigmented the lipsticks of YSL they do
have this very specific YSL
scent I don't know how to describe all
the lip products I have from them have
this scent but I love it
so that's everything I'm gonna bawl
today I hate I feel exhausted but I've
got so many goodies I'm so excited to
try out perhaps review on my channel let
me know what you'd like to see demo
reviews on I can link if you're like
that's way too much high end I can link
some drugs to our hauls that I've done
recently on my channel that is really
what my channel is rooted in and almost
when I do high-end hauls I love them I
mean it's so exciting but I feel like
I'm like breaking my own code because
that a drugstore is like my game that's
my love and there's so much in the
drugstore that is just as good as all of
this stuff so definitely if you're into
more drugstore that's what my channel is
all about so subscribe if you'd like I
am so glad you watched my whole video
this was a long one and now I catch you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
