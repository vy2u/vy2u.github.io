need your help we're trying to we're
gonna I'm making green beans
Almondine which I've never made before
but it looks really good it's got like
almonds in it that are cooked in either
oil or butter and then with the green
beans and then Tyler's about to do the
ham I'm excited to see what he does with
that we were joking about Bob's Burgers
if you watch it which apparently a lot
of you guys do because when I when that
was in one of the other vlogs a lot of
guys were like oh my gosh your loved
Bob's Burgers like we do too
so I hate joke to this Tyler's gonna be
like bob is with his turkey on
Thanksgiving Tyler will be the same way
with his hand Christmas so then I'm also
making mashed potatoes the Martha
Stewart way which was simpler than I
thought but it uses heavy cream right
heavy whipping cream yeah which we
actually have we like rarely hot but we
have today so I'm gonna use that and
then we're gonna have some bread that
we're just gonna warm and assemble
assemble and we already have our
appetizer we're gonna do like we
actually tried it at our the Fresh
Market down the street it was just like
nice crackers with some sort of
artisanal cheese and we have a couple
with basil which Tyler made homemade
best bezel basil I'm thinking of ours no
um
oh that's funny no um who's the guy this
is basil I mean most people I think in
England say basil instead of bass uh
Jamie Oliver yeah Jamie
when he says basil how they pronounce it
um so now I think that but anyway Tyler
made his own castle
pesto from scratch with pine nuts and
everything and it is amazing so you put
that on the cracker then you put Leah
they had salami so we're gonna slice the
salami or some sort of lincoln smoke
whatever and then the cheese and it is
the bits not healthy but it is the best
thing ever I mean come on come on
When in Rome one Christmas but I'm
excited to try there you try your ham
Tyler we will see it's gonna be good we
are about to watch home alone the
original one of my favorites and I even
remember when I lived in Chicago I
traveled up to the actual house and
Winnetka Illinois and just saw it and
creepily took pictures and Tyler's about
to get his name goin Tyler community
cutie County handsome he looks he has
haircut he looks real good
oh yeah I love it off in the distance oh
my look up in the distance why I ordered
a bunch of tools last week like zippers
backwards there was a
Tyler's really weird and Goofy he do
look like a muppet some sort of Italian
muffin okay
the meal is done and now we're dealing
with the aftermath
so there's Tyler by cutting the rest of
the ham off the bones right put your
knife I got this Cutco put your knife
like what $4.99 a goodwill you never
know what you find
although that's not a butcher knife what
is that a saying to go or not saying
right well anyway I don't know much my
guys clearly know this is awesome yeah
he did and cut cause a lifetime warranty
so he bought it a goodwill took it in
and they sharpened it and got it like
looking like brand-new yeah
that's what they do anyway but
everything went really well that green
beans didn't steam properly because we
don't have a lid that fits that griddle
so I'm learning mashed potatoes worked
out really well that Martha Stewart
recipe was awesome and the bread was
just Brendon I mean but his cheesecake
was amazing but we've got oh so many
dishes to do so we're gonna continue
watching home alone we started it over I
love it and cleanup but we got some
amazing gifts and it was so lovely just
everyone being here and so it was just a
really lovely night ah good morning
crazy air um I got CP puppy here
Pinocchio
he says nothing leave me alone he's on
the vet
like pain medicine he can only take like
half of one but so I think I don't know
for sure but I think it might make him a
little sleepy so every time he's taking
it he's just like mmm and he just goes
right to bed
but we're just drinking coffee I am
editing a video I make up one not a vlog
finally and we're just kind of today
relaxing we've got at 3:00 today we've
got dinner at my parents house my
family's house so we'll we might try and
blog there too but my parents just
always do like a Sunday dinner on Sunday
so what am I trying to say Oh like every
month sorry my brain hasn't turned on
this morning handsome are you in the
frame I'm trying to do this backwards
it's hard to do you can see in the frame
my Messier who looks handsome I think we
showed it squeeze him so I'm getting us
all checked in for our London trip which
is in late it's a week from tomorrow
that's crazy like it came out of nowhere
so I'm getting us all checked into our
apartment in that guys have given more
arrival details but if you guys want to
follow along while we're in London we're
gonna be posting vlogs everyday but on
my channel cuz my channel is all about
travel so make sure you subscribe now
it's that way when we're in London
you'll be here and get all of our
silliness what are they yeah a shameless
plug and furthermore well I'm trying to
think of what the cutoff will be when do
we leave Monday the maybe next 21st yeah
well I'm thinking that should just be
the cutoff so whatever anything here
I'll do on here but then it'll just
switch over to yours the first few days
before Christmas yeah if you want to
keep following it flog mess yeah and
then some
because we we've always vlog and it's
funny because a lot of people don't know
that we blog a decent amount like any
time we go on a trip we vlog but they're
just on his channel because that's kind
of what his channel is all about
so it just makes sense to us and mine is
not a vlog channel which is why I don't
any news so except when it comes to
vlogmas yeah so monster of a beast
it is fun though monster of a beast okay
so I'm finally ready to go and we got we
both got some videos edited he's working
on one
my niece got married a couple months
after I did she's an older my I've got a
big family my oldest brother's like in
his 40s so my niece my oldest niece is I
think turning 22 this coming year anyway
she also got married this year so he
actually filmed Tyler did her wedding
and all kinds of things so he's putting
that together and editing it for her he
just came in so we are about to go to my
parents house to see them for a couple
hours and do our monthly Sunday night
dinner with them so I know key
I need a runt he seems to be feeling
better he was not this is what day -
after his surgery and he was just kind
of acting weird earlier just like he
felt really hot and he was like he kept
going while you were sleeping are you
doing better yeah I'm okay mama all
right
I'm ruined but so while he's doing that
so that package I opened on the other
vlogmas from candy club well we are my
sister-in-law yesterday she was loving
some of them so we gave her some of the
candy just cute and then my dad loves
gummies too so we're gonna bring this to
him because I was like if we have this
candy around as I stated in that vlogmas
I will literally eat all of it does
anyone else have this problem look at
this oh my gosh that drives me
absolutely bonkers
I should have hair sprayed I like dry
shampoos my hair you know stay to hair
but it's looking crazy see what else is
new it always looks crazy like it's just
my family I'll be fine
but like this nail polish I'm wearing
look like half of it's chipped off I'm
like good just painted them two days ago
fantastic so anyway but I'm realizing if
I can find awesome nail polishes that
just take one coat
they never chip but like this one took
two coats and then of course a top coat
and I didn't even put a base coat when I
realized that it needed to because then
it would have been four layers and
that's stuff chips so quickly because it
like pops right off because it's so
thick it's easy for something to get
under it and then it just pops off so oh
I don't know
and it was not a cheap nail polish I
can't think of the brand it's I really
like other colors Furman is um Smith and
Colt which I've bought on Birchbox is
website but they are not cheap but I've
had other colors that are amazing they
say on but this color I love the actual
color like the whitish pink but look
it's even chipping on that one I give up
welcome to our lives one of those is the
Gwen Stefani palette we do pretty much
everything except grocery shopping
online everything we buy online in price
we pay that's right so you know what so
I'm at all these right now and we forgot
we needed to bring drinks for my parents
house but I love all these so much
here's our Christmas tree at my parents
house yeah they used like the giant
lights which I love when I was a kid as
a kid but is this where the day is done
I'm tired and I don't know if Tyler is
but um what was I gonna say Tyler didn't
I say I didn't eat it I don't know
either
oh I didn't want to show you guys
another thing we did get in the mail is
Pinocchio this we had to get like on I
wasn't an Amazon Tyler from some Rando
seller and it was just like like new but
it's otherwise it was so ridiculously
priced cause it's in the vault right now
so you can't just buy it from Disney so
some people were charging like hundreds
of dollars their plan we were like no
but we found this one for I think around
20 anyway but I'm really excited because
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
but we both loved it and of course our
dog is named Pinocchio so I'm excited to
maybe watch that this week any Hugh but
that is all for now so we'll see you
guys in the next vlog bye how do you
want to say bye
every time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
