everyone is Jessica and today I'm going
to do a demo and a review of the
hourglass ambient lighting palette now
this retails for $58 which is ridiculous
and it was one of those things that for
literally a year I grappled with back
and forth and at one point I bought one
single powder of I want it wasn't one of
these it was diffused light and I wasn't
impressed so I returned it because that
one alone was like I want to say almost
fifty dollars so I returned it and I was
going to get this like in its place
because there's only a little bit more
expensive and I didn't and now I regret
that because I could have been looking
awesome for a year so I'm going to get
into the demo of how I use this as
someone with fair skin because I think
that's different than someone that has
darker skin because the colors it makes
a difference where you would put them on
your face so let's go ahead and get into
the demo and afterwards I will go into
the details of if I would recommend this
and other things like that
okay so I've done my makeup for the day
and the last thing I haven't done is
highlight or finishing powder or
whatever and I've mentioned in a few
Reason videos that I really don't pout
or powder my face anymore
I used to use like a mattifying powder
right here but I realized that that's
kind of what makes me look more youthful
and more awake and so when I powder that
little bit of grease away for me on my
skin I feel like it ends up looking just
dull especially in the winter when I'm
already dry so I really have not been
using setting powders very much
especially in that area but for the sake
of this video I will show you what I
would do because this these powders
don't make me look dry and cakey and
dull because that literally the idea
behind them is that it's adding life and
light into your face so I really only
use two colors in this I use this color
here in this color here and if I get it
right this should be this must be
radiant light and incandescent light I
think I labeled them wrong the other
time and then this one I think is dim
light yeah that seems right so radiant
light is the one I use like I can use
all over my face because it's a little
bit less shimmery none of them are crazy
shimmery at all but this one's the least
shimmery and it's the most like skin
color one for me so I ended up using
that one all over my face in a way and I
just use
any powder brush it doesn't really
matter and I just kind of dotted onto it
because it does kick up a lot of dust
and you don't really need a pond a bunch
a punch so I will usually just dust that
right down the bridge of my nose and
then right here on my forehead and you
notice right away I don't know if you
know it's been in person right away any
I have like little bits of breakouts and
stuff that aren't really showing through
but I can see like the ridges of them
right away when I put this on it's as if
they disappeared like it it it perfects
your skin I don't know how else to
describe that so that was amazing to me
the first time I applied that one I was
like wow like if my skin looks so much
more perfected then what I'll typically
do is I'll still take that same color
and go ahead and put it where I'm going
to add highlight as well but just to add
a little bit more perfection I'll kind
of dust that even right over my
concealer there and back same thing on
the other side so that's all I'll do
with that powder and when I'm not trying
to look crazy highlighting it amazing
I'll just do that but most days I will
also do the middle color which is that
incandescent light and I'll use a
smaller brush because I want to be a
little more precise this is the diva
Beauty round contour but you can use
anything that's that's I mean knees
anything so I'm just going to again just
tap it into it because it kicks up a lot
and this time I am in and tap off a
little excess and I'm just going to
focus it not necessarily right above my
cheekbone because then it gets too high
I'm going to kind of do it right there
and a little bit around my blush because
I want my blush to kind of glow as well
so I'm just gonna kind of swirl it
really lightly in that area I'm gonna
get a little bit more
I can even take a little bit up above
the brow bone there if you wanted and it
just adds a little bit of a sheen there
is some shimmer to it but it's nothing
you know it's nothing like the mary lou
manizer where you know it's like crazy
shimmery like you can literally use this
as an eye shadow nothing like that it
adds the most perfect amount of glow you
really can't screw it up so let me go
ahead and do it to the other side same
thing in the highlight area above my
cheekbone but also a little bit on the
blush just cuz I used a matte blush
today
so just to awaken it a little bit a
little bit more and then what I'll
usually go back through just to make
sure there's not too much of any one
thing anywhere I'll take that powder
brush I used with the radiant light is
how what that is and I'm just going to
kind of brush over it to make sure that
there it's not to highlight II just to
kind of spread it out over the regions
of my face so the only one I really am
not finding myself using is this one
here just because it is more of an
orange tone I have in the past and I'll
go ahead and show you you can use like a
fan brush or something or really any
brush and I'll just take a little bit of
this and I would just sweep it here but
it really doesn't I'm not I don't even
want to do it because it doesn't really
do anything for it just adds a little
bit of shimmer back to the bronzer or
contour that you might have used and I
don't really like the look it gives so
this is amazing as a highlight color if
you do have darker skin if you don't you
can still use it like I could still use
it there and it'd be fine and I'll
swatch it for you guys you can kind of
see it's not like it's crazy dark but it
is a little more orange tone so I just
don't find that I am using it see so for
a glowy bronzer for fair skin it would
look nice and that way I'm just not
really into that so other than that I
kind of wish they made a duo of just
these two and getting them alone is gel
almost as expensive as buying the
palette really so I love this
that is that's how I've been using it
lately so obviously I love this palette
and it's one of those things that I
think if I did run out of like one of
the shades instead of getting the
palette I think I would end up buying a
single of whichever one I'd run out of
because I'm realizing you know for me I
travel all the time Tyler and I both
travel I mean he has a Travel Channel so
I mean we travel a lot and I would
rather not bring a whole pallet it's
going to take up a lot of room I'd
rather bring like if I wanted just one
of these just bring one of the powders
which I think if I were to just buy one
I think I would buy the one that I use
all over my face which is the radiant
light because it makes you look so
candlelit and there is a drugstore dupe
you guys now some people will disagree
with me that this is a dupe but I in my
heart of hearts feel that it is now this
is the ambient lighting powder in a
radiant light that I love this is a wet
and wild one and it's the bronzer called
reserve your Cabana it's not really a
bronzer clearly and so this is what my
own this is ambient lighting and I've
talked about this before
but they end up doing the exact same
thing on your skin now I will say that I
think the there's a little bit of a
shade difference the am the one want one
is a little more yellow tone in the
ambient one is a little more pinkish
however I think that the overall look on
your skin is the same where it just
makes you look so flawless and beautiful
and you just feel like a million bucks
I don't really know how else to describe
that and I've noticed such a difference
between when I use a powder like these
and when I don't and I get compliments
like wow you look so radiant today or
you look your skin looks really nice it
really makes a difference so if you're
not wanting to get all three of these or
you really don't want to splurge because
that's a lot of money I highly highly
recommend the wet and wild one it is 399
it is a huge thing of it it does expire
after like a year or two because it's it
has SPF in it added bonus but it really
is amazing now back to this since the
video is about this the packaging on
this
it's pretty but I hate that you can see
your fingerprints on it but it is I mean
these powders are smaller than like if
you were to buy a full one of one of
them that's way bigger than this so keep
that in mind as well
there's no there's no noticeable smell
there is a little bit of a and I notice
this with the one when I bought it I
guess there is a smell but it's nothing
that's so pungent that it bothers you
you know no horrible smell or anything
like that the texture of these is really
just velvety the only one that doesn't
feel is velvety although it looks
velvety is the middle one in
incandescent light that's the only one
that doesn't feel as smooth as the
others but it goes on just as smooth if
that makes a difference I noticed that
the wear time it stays put it doesn't go
anywhere especially if you used a primer
on your face now what I have noticed
that when I use a setting spray on top
of it it really
electrifies it so when I have first
applied this in the morning and I apply
a setting spray it's almost too much but
if I were to apply like a setting spray
to kind of revive my face halfway
through the day then it looks really
nice but it is a lot when you put them
together so what I would recommend is
that if you do put a setting spray on
right after applying this take some sort
of clean brush and just kind of buff it
into the skin just the setting spray
that way it kind of evens it all out a
little more so you look a little more
flawless because otherwise it does
Electrify it so I bought mine at Sephora
and like I said it's $58 I have I always
have links for Sephora
okay phone I hear you vibrate noble
energies I do always have links for
Sephora coupons below so I will put any
coupons I can find down below if you're
interested and you can usually get like
a free gift with purchase and things
like that and of course support as there
like you know if you spend $100 you
could get a hundred point perk so there
are little things you can do to help but
um oh my gosh this is amazing so overall
what I recommend it obviously yes I
would now like I said I always like to
provide drugstore options when I can
because my channel is I mean it's mostly
drugstore anyway so this is what I would
recommend if you don't want to spend the
money which I do not blame you it took
me a long time to finally
to it so hopefully that review is
helpful if you're interested I will link
all of my other reviews down below as
well as my recent high-end haul where I
hauled this and a ton of other things
that was so exciting so if you're
interested check those out please
subscribe if you would and I'll catch
you guys in my next video bye
