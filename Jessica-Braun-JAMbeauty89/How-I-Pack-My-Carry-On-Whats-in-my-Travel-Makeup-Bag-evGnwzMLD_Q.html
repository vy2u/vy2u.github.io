going to be doing a video on how to pack
for a vacation where you are carrying on
every single bag because we all know how
expensive those stupid stupid stupid
checked bag fees are they are ridiculous
and so this video is just filled with a
lot of tips on how I kind of consolidate
the things that I'm bringing I maximize
the space that I have it's just kind of
how I organize everything and it also
includes
all the makeup that I'm bringing in my
makeup bag and what parts of my makeup I
have to put in the quart sized bag and
what parts that I don't because I did a
lot of research on that to make sure
that I knew so hopefully this will be
very helpful for you guys and I'll see
you guys in just a second okay so I
figured I would start first with the
outfit that I'm wearing tomorrow I
always put it out to the side whatever
I'm going to be wearing to fly just so I
don't accidentally pack it and have to
rummage through all my organization over
there so I always bring a some sort of
fleece I love my North Face so I usually
bring that just because I always get
cold in the airport and things like that
and it just you know just kind of cozy
especially if you're trying to nap
because you know I'm trying to nap so
that's like the best nap blankie ever
except for it's not like it
anyway um flip flops because it's easier
to go through security and just flip
flop them off and then flip flop them
right back on instead of havin to like
tie shoes or undo straps things like
that
I'm wearing like just a plain comfy
v-neck from Target that I love and then
capris again because I get cold if I
were to wear shorts I would be freezing
the whole time and we have a pretty long
layover so yeah I'm just trying to be
comfortable I'm also wearing jewelry I
know a lot of people don't because well
you have you probably have to take it
off for security and usually you do
sometimes I've gotten away with not
doing it but I don't know I just like
wearing jewelry even I know it's
probably sounds silly but that's one of
those few things that I'm like whatever
I'll take the time to take them off
because I just like wearing jewelry so
that is that so that's my outfit for
tomorrow and I just got it set out to
the side so over here I've got I'm
carrying on both of these things this
bag and this suitcase and if you look at
it's actually
we not that big and it is carry-on size
I have this cute little luggage tag that
I got from Disney World
just love it and I'm actually haven't
utilized these because I haven't had a
need which is crazy but I've I think
I've kind of perfected the way that I
pack and how much I bring so I actually
didn't even need these so let's go ahead
get started with the suitcase the way I
organized it I have all my clothes on
the side here and they're all rolled up
and if you look down in the layers you
can see there's like shorts down here
let me go ahead and dig down in there
shall we
I've got like some mint some coral some
white shorts and jean shorts I've got
dresses I've got all my tops and I also
have workout clothes and PJs back there
and if you look a little deeper you'll
see I'm just gonna unpack then repack
how about that I keep all of my shoes in
these gallon size bags just to prevent
dirt from getting on all my other things
um so I have these sandals
that kind of go with everything they're
great cuz they're silver and gold so
they really do go with like every outfit
I have my running shoes because we are
planning on running there in the
mornings Tyler and I so I have those
with me and usually I'll wear my bulkier
shoes but when it comes to flying you
know it's just easier to slip those on
and off so I figured I would just pack
them and bite the bullet and then I also
have my heels that I am going to be
wearing and you'll be seeing these in a
lot of outfit of the days on Instagram
um so yeah let's see so those are all my
clothes up here I have my undergarments
I keep them in these mesh bags and I
actually have an extra one down here I
can show you just because as I wear them
I can put them in here and that way I
know which ones I've worn and which ones
I haven't and I also have my swimsuit
packed in there and then I have some
belts down there to belts and then this
is my jewelry organizer
and this is a great thing to invest in
it actually it's not even that big of an
investment they're not that expensive
but you just keep your jewelry organized
and I'm sure it looks like a jumbled
mess but these are actually snapped in
and they're tucked in so it's my two
more dainty necklaces are safely in
there all of my earrings I know it looks
like a mumbo-jumbo on one came off but
pretty much all of them are very secure
perhaps maybe I'll move these hoops into
a zipper pocket so I'll have to look
into that but everything else seems to
be pretty good pretty um
early in their and here I have a
statement necklace kind of zipped in and
then I have my bracelets hooked on
through this you unhook it I'm slide
them in and then you can snap it back so
they're secure I've got my watch some
hoops some more bracelets and actually I
have every single outfit planned out
down to the jewelry and shoot so you'll
see that and then I have another
statement necklace zipped into here so
that's all of that and then you zip it
up and it fits right in there um and
then I have I got this little unlike
heat protector thing from Marshall's
actually and it's the Peter Coppola
brand I think yeah actually I just
opened it I bought a while ago but I
haven't used it yet but it's just so
cute and it holds my curling wand that I
have and then I also have my round brush
in there and then you can even put it in
it when it's hot which is great and then
I also have my cord tucked into there
and I'm not bringing my straightener and
I'm also not bringing a hairdryer
because I'm going to use the hairdryer
there because why take up the extra
space when they have a hairdryer there
that works just fine so then I also
bring my purse that I'm going to be
carrying around this is by deluxe
um right chief you can get out on um I
love this bag it's a longer strapped bag
if you know what I mean and it's just
great for travel for walking around I
can fit enough in it but it's not too
heavy and then inside I actually tucked
in a wristlet for the night time this I
got at Target it's just great because
you can fit your cards you kind of strap
your phone in there and then it snaps
it's really perfect for nighttime this
is perfect for daytime that way I'm not
lugging a huge honking purse but I just
pack it instead of bringing it with me
because I have all my purse items in my
carry-on bag here so for now I just keep
it packed away empty and then I had
these two bags in here as well so I'll
go over this one this one is the London
Soho brand
I love stripes it's so cute I'm keeping
my brushes my makeup brushes they're my
Beauty Blender my razor which I've
learned for carrying on you can bring
like the disposable type razors you know
you are allowed to bring those they are
allowed so that surprised me and I was
really excited about that
so that's what I keep off there I have a
brush organizer but I'm bringing too
many brushes so I was like you know what
this is just easier this has a hanging
thing which i think is really neat and
then down here you can zip up and I've
got my facial wipes some eye makeup
remover wipes my deodorant my toothbrush
oh my hair ties I'm keeping in this
little thing that I got from my friend
amber it just holds your ponytails in it
and they don't go anywhere it is really
really neat and then some bobby pins
also held together with a hair tie I
also have my little band that I used to
hold back my hair when I'm getting ready
in the morning instead of bringing nail
polish I'm bringing nail polish remover
pads just to get rid of that extra
liquid I'm saying with this usually for
my eye makeup remover I have eye makeup
remover liquid and cotton rounds but
instead I'm just gonna bring this
because it's not a liquid so I don't
have to keep it that way so I really
like that so that's what's kind of
packed in there so this is the makeup
bag and everything in here is like
everything that's not liquid so I have
my uni palette which has a lot of
shadows in it including my brow powder
which is my main reason for bringing it
i depotted some of my ELF High
Definition yellow powder into a smaller
container so it takes it less room I'm
bringing this Mac quad huh in caramel
sundae it's from the Archie collection I
love these three shades I use them all
the time
my hoola bronzer I'm bringing two
bronzers I know if I can fight yeah my
Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer I just love
this in conjunction with each other for
highlight I'm bringing Mac soft and
gentle for my blush I'm only bringing
one and bringing the hot mama blush by
the balm
more shadow I'm bringing this Sigma
little trial thing for this middle shade
I use a lot in the crease that I love
it's kind of a gold shimmery it's called
command and I'm bringing of course my
concealer in 2:30 the covergirl no lay
one the NIC stay matte but not flat
powder foundation that I love and then I
brought two different lip colors for
daytime and bringing the Revlon balm
stain in honey and then for nighttime
I'm bringing the Sonia Kashuk rosette
lipstick it's there's a swatch of it
actually it's really really pretty and
then some liners that I brought some
physician formula ones one that's just
black and then also one that's like a
bronzy color and
then my NYX jumbo eye pencil in Kashmir
which is this really pretty kind of I
don't even know how to describe that
color it's really pretty
hold on while I get the cap back on
there there we go my gel eyeliner from
L'Oreal some chapstick that I always rip
off the thing because I like don't know
how to open it I swear and is that all
that's in your oh and also my l'oreal
infallible liner in ice latte that I
love and then another essence liner in
bling bling that I love so those are all
the things that I didn't have to put in
the quart size bag and then I'll just
I'll get that repacked in the sec so in
this bag from Old Navy which I recently
hauled is where I keep its basically
what I'm going to be keeping with me
everything is going with me but you know
what I mean so I have I love this outer
pocket I've got headphones of course
some gum snack these are seriously good
the roasted almond is out of this
friggin world it's like way sweeter than
you would ever imagined my Nivea lip
butter which now that I'm thinking about
it I wonder if I'll have to put this in
a in the ziplock bag I'll probably
switch that to that before I get on the
flight or before I go through security
okay so in here I've got my sunglasses
that I got from shop lately recently
that I'm bringing along and that I just
lived and then let's see my iPad of
course and actually I want to show you
some of the things that I use when I am
like let me get it like facing up right
some of the things that I use I use this
app called you packing lists free and
you can do your list and like I've got
carry-on and everything that I want to
have my carry-on
I'm sure it's blurry but you don't
really need to see exactly outfits ideas
that I had
suitcase things that are going in my
main suitcase and then as you click it
it'll kind of check it off on the side
so it's pretty really really neat and
really simple and then another thing I
do which you guys are probably gonna
laugh at me
but um here let me pull it up just a
second
oh no it's frozen I'm getting too many
Instagram updates it's like keeps oh my
gosh okay
so hold on let me pull it up here what
I'll do is I will have my outfits all
kind of make it use a photo grid app to
take pictures of all my outfits and I
will be uploading these on Instagram as
it comes up but these are kind of my
outfits that I'm wearing some of my
nighttime some of my daytime and you'll
be seeing a lot of these very very soon
on Instagram as I wear them but I like
to do that also whether I upload them on
Instagram or not just because I can see
what I had planned because I do take the
time to plan on my outfits and see what
jewelry and what shoes and everything so
I like to have that as a reference point
so this is my iPad that I keep in here
obviously my wallet let's see I've got
my planner from May designs I think May
designs calm they're really really cute
planners and boy I use it I've got some
pictures some kiddos colored for me but
of course and then I've got my New
Orleans guide book that I love and then
the book I'm reading which is the Great
Gatsby I read it in high school but I
want to see the movie but before I see
it I want to reread the novel because I
am a bookworm and I just got these
bookmarks in the mail on Amazon if you
type in magnetic bookmarks they're these
really cool they're magnetic so you see
your bookmark doesn't fall out because
that is a huge problem for me which that
might sound silly but it is I'm also
bringing a magazine glamour I've got
like my medicines like lactase and
allergy medicine things like that and
there this is where I keep lipsticks
that I kind of on the go I have another
Sonia Kashuk one in blushing which is
like this pretty pink color and then I
also have Mac cream cap in there so I
love this little bag it's also from Old
Navy I recently hauled I just think it's
so cute I'm trying to get oh I my
contacts case in there I've already
shown you O my iPad an iPhone charger
both of the charges are in there in this
little section I have tissues because it
is allergy season for me and then a
little pad of paper because I'm
constantly writing things down I feel
like and then I think the last thing
that I haven't shown you in here is my
liquids bag and at the quart size bag I
bring along an extra which I'll be
packing just in case something happens
or something explodes in this one but in
it I did a lot of research to make sure
I knew exactly of course some nail
polish that I just have the Polish I'm
wearing and then the
Cote and then I also have my face wash
some hairspray I guess I can go over it
so my favorite top coat
Revlon this is Essie mod square which is
what I'm wearing on my nails right now I
have my face cream in here this is
actually my face wash that I use every
single day in it my skin has completely
turned around from using this so I have
natural glow lotion put into this little
container I have the foundation that I'm
bringing which is the wet and wild cover
all let's see I've got some Neutrogena
sunblock and a travel size some
hairspray this is Sebastian shaper zero
gravity hairspray I have some urban
decay D slick in a travel size little
thing and then I have two mascaras the
rocket and then one by one these are
both by Maybelline the rocket I wear
every single day it's like the bomb but
this is great for like midway through
the day if I want to like reapply it
does that really well so liquid
eyeliners I had to put in the bag the
Physicians Formula
eye booster one I have my little eye
decanted my Misti or perfume into this
flow atomizer I got one for my boyfriend
Tyler's while he loves it you just put
it you literally spray it into this
little contraption at the bottom and
then it's like a really safe to travel
with a little perfume thing and then my
toothpaste which is the pronamel a
really weak enamel like legit it's
really bad so that's what that's for
eyedrops because like I said it's
allergy season lip gloss the NYX this is
great for toning down like my nighttime
lips with that I'm bringing and this is
great for its sugarpie by NYX this is
another lip gloss I've been loving the
L'Oreal caress ones it's in pink
perserverence those are the bomb my
since this is technically a liquid
concealer even though it's like coming
out through a sponge this is the
brightener shade from the Maybelline
instant age rewind that I absolutely
adore and then my eye primer is a stick
one but on the other side it's a liner
sealer and it's liquid so I'm putting
that in there and then also my ELF
makeup remover pen I swear I use this
every single day it's not really a
liquid but I figure better safe than
sorry so that is everything and I think
that's all my stuff now I got to repack
all this junk but um but
I hope this was helpful for you guys and
I think I've kind of really gotten used
to travelling without having to check a
bag and it's kind of almost like a
challenge but I hope this was helpful
for you guys
