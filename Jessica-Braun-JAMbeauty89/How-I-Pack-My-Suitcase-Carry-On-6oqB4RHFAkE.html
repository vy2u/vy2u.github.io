bringing you an updated packing video so
in this video I'll just be going over
how I pack my suitcase what kinds of
organizational systems I use kind of
separate clothes from shoes from
toiletries and the different products
bags things like that that I use to help
organize in that way I will be doing a
follow up video which actually I've
already filmed a video of what's in my
makeup bag so the makeup that I'm
bringing with me on this trip so that
will be a separate video which you can
look out for but in this one it'll just
be about the organization and you also
get to see the different toiletries and
things like that that I am bringing so
hopefully this video will be helpful for
you all and if you have any packing tips
that you'd like to share with me please
let them down below and that will help
others that can scroll through and see
even more packing tips if you leave a
comment so hopefully this is helpful and
I hope you enjoy it I'll see you in just
a second okay so here in my here's my
suitcase here and you can kind of see
the general layout of the way that I
organized it and then this is my
carry-on bag here I actually got it at
Old Navy it's kind of like very similar
to some of the longshots bags that are
for sale for like a hundred to two
hundred dollars but this one I got for
like ten dollars on clearance and I
think it's really really cute
so I always lay out my travel outfit
before anything so I oh I'm pretty much
always just wears some sort of cotton
v-neck tee that's comfortable jeans that
are also comfortable and these are
really comfortable and they're really
easy to roll up like kind of into capris
if I get a little hot and I really like
that and they're really just kind of
breathable just some nude flats and then
just a black fleece in case I get chilly
fleeces are just I just feel so
comfortable unemployement I'm wearing a
fleece I don't know I'm weird about it
so that's my travel outfit I even have
like my stud earrings and necklace set
out elsewhere but ok so we'll go ahead
and dig into the carry-on first so like
I said I got this old navy there's just
two pockets there's this one here and in
here I'll be keeping my phone it's not
in there now but that's where I keep my
phone like a charger
and like a pen and then in here you're
gonna laugh it's like book heavy I have
so many but I read I like to read and I
like to research and plus we're going to
a beach so I like to have stuff to read
on the beach too so I just have like
this little notebook because I write
things down all the time I make plans
for YouTube on here I just make lists of
things and I just like to write so
that's there and then I have some guide
books my iPad I have to take an exam to
get my license to be a teacher so I'm
going to be studying for that because I
have to take it in December then I have
a couple magazines in style things like
that glamour and then I also back here
okay I have my wallet in here I have my
sunglass case I got at I think like
Marshalls and then I have my sunglasses
aren't they cute yours like my PJ pants
by the way I look so good I'm so
comfortable right now okay it's getting
late
alright let's see oh and then I also
have this kind of has everything else
that I would need in it it's a little
Marc Jacobs bag I got from actually
target last Christmas my boyfriend got
it for me so I've just got all kinds of
little bags that hold necessities in
them because the way I like to organize
in little bags so like I've got a pack
of gum I haven't even opened yet
ibuprofen my contacts case here tissues
mints you know my headphones by the way
I got this little guy that holds my
headphones from like Eddie Bauer a long
time ago I've had it forever and it
actually hooks onto my keys but I don't
really need my keys with me so I just
think it's so cute it's lovely so I just
have all kinds of things in these like
little flossers and things like that so
that is what's in there and I just like
to have those all together so I'm not
fishing around in this kind of bigger
bag for all of my necessities I know
that I'll be able to find it in this bag
so I can just look for this then I know
I'll be able to find it so let me kind
of get this stuff out of the way and
let's go ahead and dig into the suitcase
so if you where to begin so up here I
keep my undergarments and swimsuits and
things like that actually most of what
you're seeing are swimsuits but I use
like these mesh laundry bags and I use
one to carry all
my clean undergarments and as I wear
them I put them in I bring an empty one
and so that's what I put them in it's
really a kind of a really good trick
that way you can keep them separated
because there's nothing more annoying
for me than becoming an organizing that
way so back here I've stuffed my little
Clinique beach bag that's kind of folded
up for now and then I also have this
little ape sea bag and in it I have a
few things I want to have with me at the
beach because I thought this little
thing and I'll put more in it but right
now a lot of my stuff is in my makeup
bag which you'll see in a second but I
know for sure like my baby lips and some
eye drops and some blotting tissue and
bobby pins things like that are going to
be in my beach bag so I just left them
in there I also have like a little
wristlet for going out in the evening I
have all my I have three different pairs
of sandals I'm not going to pull them
out but they're all here and I put them
in a gallon sized ziplock bag just to
keep them from getting everything dirty
and then I also have playing cards some
Mickey Mouse ones and then I also have
my slippers there some Vera Wang ones
there so that's pretty much what's back
there I need to zip it up but it's okay
so down here I have all my clothes I'm
not going to go through all of them I
kind of have it organized according to
what type of thing it is I have like
dresses in this row Here I am going to a
wedding there so I brought a couple
options for dresses but yeah I've got
like cardigans and tank tops over here
just all kinds of things and underneath
all of this are my shorts and things
like that I have my floppy beach hat
kind of folded up here what I love about
this I got it from
shop lately calm which is one of my
favorite websites I can link it down
below and this hat is awesome because
you can fold it up every which way and
it always reshapes itself like within an
hour so it's really handy for traveling
because I got to fold it up pretty small
okay so back here is this Minnie Mouse
towel that my boyfriend had made for me
with my name it's actually not engraved
oh my gosh not engraved stitched into it
embroidered into it and he has one for
himself that's a Mickey Mouse one so I'm
gonna have to start taking this stuff
out so you can see below so that is that
towel then in this bag here which is a
Sonia Kashuk bag I fit most of my
toiletries and things like that
think this bag is so adorable Sonia
Kashuk always sells really really cute
things and I think I got this when it
was on sale I'm sure I did knowing me
but it's so perfect for storing a lot of
things so I have like a travel loofah
here it's just a like a little bit
smaller I have some sunblock I love this
one it's really simple Hawaiian Tropic
SPF 30 things like that I have like my
makeup remover wipes here that I get at
Big Lots let's see oh my brush by Peter
Coppola all my makeup remover wipes
deodorant and here I just have like a
headband to hold my hair back this my
friend amber sent me it's so perfect I
can hold hair ties and bobby pins in it
so I've got all my hair supplies all in
one convenient small location it's not
taking up like any space at all so nice
then I also have like my moisturizer i
depotted into a travel container my
toothbrush and then let's see I don't
think I stuffed anything in here and
here I stuffed all of my travel-sized
toiletries I got this at Big Lots
actually the tack is still on I should
probably take that off there's only
$3.00 and it came with another makeup
bag but I love this because it's
carry-on approved I'm not carrying this
bag on so it didn't really matter but
it's nice to have for the future because
a lot of times we do so I've got in it
like my macadamia healing oil treatment
for hair a travel size lotion toothpaste
let's see Josie Maran moisturizer with
the sunscreen
Sebastian hair spray I think that's an
urban decay d slick setting spray head
to toe wash I actually it's in like a
separate little baggie because it tends
to spill but I use this as face wash and
then I also have some trial things this
is the rainforest Moisture little hair
butter thing from the body shop I think
anyway so that's pretty much all it's in
there but it's kind of amazing how much
you can fit in this little thing here
and then I also in this glinting gleam
bag which is also from that website shop
lately I have all my jewelry that I'm
bringing and inside I have this
container which I got from Chinatown I
think in Chicago actually and I have
some earrings and necklace and like
mostly study or
and well no there's also a pair but I
just keep little things in here that are
tend to get lost and then everything
else in here like bigger bracelets that
you know are kind of okay on their own
so I'm really only bringing a cup we're
gone for over a week but I'm only
bringing a couple bracelets a watch and
a couple earrings because how much do
you really need if you're on the beach
most of the time but bags like this are
so great to save because when you're not
bringing much jewelry they're so perfect
so that's let me push these things out
of the way I may I'm making a mess
everything I'm have to repack all this
guy's okay
so in here I have my hair towel that
kind of is like a turban if you will you
wrap it to dry your hair and a robe cuz
I know that might seem excessive but I
am just so much more comfortable when I
have those things because I'm used to
them that I'd rather just make room for
them and bring them let's see what else
this is my makeup bag that I'm carrying
virtually all of my makeup in and this
is the best bag ever it's the perfect
size it's wipeable
and I filmed a separate video with all
of the contents in this and it's oh I
love all the makeup that's in here I
love so it's just kind of like my prized
possession right now because everything
that's like my favorite is in here so
the video I will if I've already
uploaded I'll link it below if not then
look out for it subscribe or whatever
you need to do because it's basically I
go over most of my Holy Grail products
so that's pretty awesome but I love this
bag okay and here I have this is a
little like hot tools carrier from I
think I got it from like TJ Maxx but I
have my curling wand in it I'm not
bringing a blow dryer because I'm the
hotel will have one I just don't need to
this is my makeup brush roll it is from
I think it's from Sephora do you guys
see the name yeah it's from Sephora and
see I'm bringing not too many brushes I
mean to some people might seem like a
ridiculous amount but I can kind of
stuff them in there pretty tight so I've
got some Sonia Kashuk here a bunch of
ELF some Real Techniques uh another elf
one what is this one bare essentials
some Sigma there but yeah that's pretty
much it it's a lot of them are packed
into a lot what
lot of them are packed and do one little
thing so it's pretty for a small little
brush roll it holds a surprising amount
honestly
so deeper in here I've got my tennis
shoes I have workout clothes in here as
well my boyfriend and I are kind of on a
fitness kick so we're planning on
working out over there just because why
not and so I've got my adidas shoes that
I love and then I also have these
probably room I I know I just butchered
it for target little shoes that I love
that are kind of more for like going out
in the evening I have them in
gallon-sized ziplocks bags cuz it just
gets dirty it gets dirt all over
everything and I just like to know that
it's not touching all of my clothes I
mean that's a little germs
hmm anyway I think that's really all now
I've got a repack it all but I think
hopefully now look at this
I've got to read back at all but I think
you pretty much get the gist of it
really I uploaded a video of this
already it was really just over the
summer but it was for a different kind
of trip so this one's more beachy you
know I've got a beach hat things like
that in it but other than that it's
pretty similar I like to roll my
clothing because it decreases wrinkling
by a little bit I wouldn't say 100% in
most hotels have ironing board so it's
never really that big of a concern of
mine but it really does allow for a lot
of space I have a lot of clothes in here
and it's pretty amazing what you can fit
when you roll it all and I you know
utilize the straps that are new suitcase
a lot of people don't and once i pack
the rest this I'm going to utilize the
other straps too because it really does
hold your things in tight of course
these clothes over here
you know they they'll probably well
they're not going to go anywhere because
of this but it's just nice it holds
everything in tight and you know they're
there you might as well use them so I
hope this was helpful let me know if you
have any other really awesome packing
tips and please leave them below and I
can't wait to read them and if you
enjoyed please subscribe and I'll see
you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
