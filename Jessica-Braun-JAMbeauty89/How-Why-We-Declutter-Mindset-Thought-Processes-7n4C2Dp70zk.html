wanted to share with you guys quickly
kind of my thoughts on de cluttering and
I do videos like this from time to time
because I know a lot of you guys watch
my declutter videos and so most of the
time I'm doing makeup sometimes I do
clothes I can like my decluttering
playlist below if you've never seen them
or maybe you want to want to see some
other ones whatever but I do feel like
throughout time I kind of and we all do
this we all kind of create our own
system for things like that so for me I
kind of have my own mindset when it
comes to decluttering and I've gotten
this mindset through watching other
people's videos you know through the way
I was raised but then also like books I
read for example like the book the
life-changing magic of tidying up by
Marie Kondo so it's just an amalgamation
of all those different things that's
kind of created my mindset when it comes
to declutter
recently I've kind of been in this mood
and I feel like it hits me once a year
where I'm like I need to purge big time
and I think the reason we get this
feeling is because we have so much stuff
and not to say that every single person
watching this video does but most of us
we have way more than we would ever need
and I don't just mean makeup I don't
mean just makeup I mean just stuff we
have way more clothes than we need we
have way more pots and pans typically
they have all those little things and
you know when you start to feel stressed
about something so for me when I start
to feel stressed out because maybe
there's just a lot of different things I
need to get done within a week I start
to feel stressed because of that but
then I feel even more stressed because
I'm like oh this area of my house is a
mess or oh my gosh I've got way too much
this stuff is falling down on me when I
pulled things out I need to organize
this I need to get rid of stuff and I do
feel like decluttering really does make
you I really feel like it does clear
your mind and I feel like for the
longest time when I declutter I'm still
holding back and I'm sure some of you
guys might be surprised to hear that
because you've seen some of mine and I
can be I can be very ruthless especially
when it comes to makeup but like when I
was looking at my closet today yesterday
I was wearing a shirt that I really
really love and we've gone out and we
went out to eat with some family and
friends and I thought I really love this
outfit I love the shoes I wear
they're comfortable I wear them all the
time they're stylish I love these jeans
I love this top and I always feel good
wearing it and I was kind of thinking
about that and I thought I should feel
that way about all of my clothes and I
have plenty but I have probably 60% of
my clothes that I don't feel that way
about and I'm like oh I'll keep it in
case all of my laundry is dirty and I
don't have anything to wear well that
never happens and so I feel like I'm
just always like like holding back and
like oh I can't let go of every single
thing but the reality is I shop enough
that if I genuinely somehow didn't have
enough clothes then I could go shop and
buy some more now the reality is I'll
always have enough because I have way
too much to start with but I think it's
just one of those things that you have
to get in the mindset of you're never
going to need it if you get rid of it
you're not gonna suddenly be thinking
about and thinking all remember that one
top that I always kept you're never
gonna think about it it would be very
very rare that that would happen and the
reality is if it did happen you're like
oh man I shouldn't get rid of that well
your day moves on and you forget about
it and then years after that you're not
gonna think about it so it's not as deep
as we make it and maybe that's what it
is we make it so deep that we're like oh
my gosh like this palette like I can't
get rid of it I spent this much money on
her oh my gosh like everyone talks about
this and I'll feel left out if I don't
have any more well I don't think that's
the case but we create these scenarios
in our head where it'd be like life or
death that we do or don't have this one
thing that we're contemplating and it's
just not that deep there are bigger
problems in the world and so I feel like
with this mindset I'm you know we're
heading into fall I really want to kind
of go through and really be serious
about it and I don't know that I'm gonna
film every portion of this because I
think some of it it's different if
you've ever filmed yourself - cluttering
I mean I'm sure most of you haven't but
if you ever have it really is different
and I feel like I'm even more cutthroat
when I'm just on my own in my pajamas
you know pulling everything out of my
closet and saying okay what are these
clothing items that I feel as strongly
about as the outfit I was wearing last
night that I feel like yes I'm so
excited this is clean I can't wait to
wear it because I am sure that even if
in the end I
they kept 15 or 20 shirts I am sure that
that is more than enough and if I start
to run out of shirts while that means I
need to do laundry because having all
this stuff is serving absolutely no
purpose and anyway I could talk about
that all day the other thing is this
idea I watched one of my favorite
youtubers her name is Alison Anderson
and I will link her channel below she
does some great decluttering and purging
things as well and she really inspires
me well she did this video about your
fantasy self and decluttering this
fantasy self of yours and she explained
it better than I will explain it so I
will link her video as well but
basically it's just this premise that we
all have this person in our mind that we
are and that person you know we might
keep a certain clothing item because
we're like well this will be perfect for
when I'm you know on the beach and I
need to cover up but it's a little bit
chilly at night so I need something
thicker than just a kimono then that's
why I've got this crocheted sweater I
think that was kind of one of the
examples she gave but we all do that and
I know that I do that so I was wanting
to think through like what are these
fantasy things about myself like even
with makeup like for example I'll keep
like a bright purple lipstick and think
well you know it's good to have one
bright purple lipstick I can't imagine
walking out of my house wearing it it
would look bizarre on me while it might
look amazing on others I know myself and
I know that no matter what the occasion
is I probably wouldn't ever wear it so
why even have one just in case when I
know that's not me like it's it's just
not it's the same with like I used to
have this one palette I wish I could
murmurs called oh it was like an urban
decay one and it was like all like it
was like neon colors and they were neon
and I used to think like in my fantasy
self I'm this person that wears like all
these bright colors and like I'm always
like well maybe I'll do like you know a
lower lashline like really bright color
like kathleenlights does from some from
time to time I never do it and if I did
I would probably grab like a colored
liner that would actually stay in place
a little bit better
versus this huge palette that I'm never
gonna use and it's just a fantasy self
kind of a thing it's the same like I
have all of these like loose shadows I
never wear blue shadow why do I keep all
of these again my fantasy self I'm like
well when I have the time to sit and get
I could pull it out well hey I hardly
ever have the time to just sit and enjoy
getting ready and B when I do it's
usually because I'm filming and usually
I'm trying to use something on my eyes
that I'm trying out because I want to
show you a demo so it never again that's
a fantasy self like oh I'm gonna have
all this time to get ready and I'll be
able to play with all these loose loose
shadows that day never happens so I feel
like I should just get rid of them I'm
keeping all of these liquid lipsticks I
have like probably 20 why I don't even
like wearing them of course I'm saying
that and I'm wearing one today but like
I only wear them when I film the few
times I wear them going out I end up
hating it because you know they're dry
and you don't you're always worried
about how it looks how crusty it looks
it's like I should just narrow down the
one or two that I might wear while
filming and then get rid of the rest and
stop accumulating them because again
that's a fantasy self you know you see
all those Instagram people that like I
mean it looks absolutely flawless and
you want your lips to look like that but
I know myself my lips never look like
that no matter what I do to them and so
I just need to declutter that another
thing and this might sound wasteful but
if you're in a position like I am and
one of your jobs whether you're a
blogger or a beauty blogger like on
YouTube is like for example skincare I
have I'm staring at it like through my
ring light right now I have ten drawers
of organized skincare none of them are
open because I have you know the few
things I use every night that are open
and the rest of those stay on open so I
give to family and friends every time
they come over they they'll go through
and pick out things here and there that
they want but it's still way too much so
what I'm trying to be better about just
for my job here is to you know if I've
used a product halfway up like maybe
it's a moisturizer I don't like you know
what I really don't like it well the
good Jessi is like I'll use it all the
way to the end and then open but what
for me would make more sense is for me
to say okay I've tried it I know I don't
like it I can maybe mention a video but
let me go ahead and move on to the next
moisturizer because a our skin is too
precious and I feel like I'm at this age
I'm late 20s 28 then I feel like I'm at
an age where my skincare we I mean it
always matters but it really matters
right now what I'm doing and if I'm
wasting five months on a moisturizer I
know I don't like and I don't feel like
it's doing anything for my skin but I'm
wanting to use all the way up I would
rather be a little bit wasteful and I'm
telling you I know how terrible this
sounds but I'd rather be a little bit
wasteful and then start my next one so
that a I really am taking care of my
skin but B so that I'm doing my job and
I know about even more moisturizers that
are out there or serums or whatever I
hope that makes sense I know how bad
that probably sounds coming across and
I'm not saying that if you don't have a
lot of the stuff not all of you guys
have these drawers
I'm a really weird subset of the world
but but it's just something that for
myself and if you're another youtuber
it's something that I'm trying to just
be better at because I feel like I'm in
I get in a skincare rut because I'm not
wanting to open something else because I
want to use something up but if I know I
hate it I just need to get rid of it
maybe I can pass it on so it's less
wasteful to like a sister cuz maybe they
have different skin than me and they
might like it but you know other than
that I can't keep forcing myself to
finish something up just because I want
to finish it if I know that it's not
helping me when it comes to my skin or
whatever my other fantasy self is like
someone that goes out all the time and
wears like fancy dresses I have way too
many dresses and I do have my dresses I
wear to work and I do wear them all the
time but then I have you know these few
that I'm like why do I have like eight
cocktail dresses that are like you know
form-fitting and short like I would
probably wear one of them once maybe
twice a year and it goes for heels too
like how often will I wear all of the
heels I have I have way too many and I
know which ones are my favorites that I
always reach for so why am i holding on
to these for that just in case because
the reality is when it really is a
special occasion like going to a wedding
like for example I was just in a wedding
my brother and my sister-in-law it was
their wedding a few weeks ago and you
know I was a bridesmaid so we had a
specific shoe we had to get anyways so
just keeping all that in mind you can
always buy shoes that are appropriate
for a special occasion but beyond that
like I've had these for years and it you
know I've never wear them kind of like
this Travel lines that I have
I remember watching Rick Steves one of
my favorite like travel TV people and he
mentioned and my husband really lives by
this model but he mentioned you know
when you're traveling and you're packing
your stuff you can't pack for the
worst-case scenario because if you do
then you're bringing
cold medicine and you know ace bandage
you bring in stuff that you're like okay
if you genuinely needed it which would
be rare they have stores in Europe how
did how did if they didn't have
everything we have in America at least
for the most part then how will they
survive thousands of years just the same
way but you know it's like you have to
get out of that mindset of worst
possible scenario and so with that in
mind like when decluttering your house
you can't think of the worst-case
scenario because if it really were
something where you're like oh no I
shouldn't have gotten rid of that one
poncho because now I need it well if you
need a poncho then just go buy one in
the moment or whatever but that was a
bad example because if it's raining and
you do I don't know but you guys get
what I'm saying you just can't think
that oh well I'm gonna keep this just in
case that worst-case scenario very
rarely happens and if it does you can
borrow it from someone else or just
finally purchase it again but holding on
to these things that are just stressing
you out is pointless I guess is what I'm
saying so I know this was like rambley
and random but I just all of these were
kind of floating around in my mind and I
just wanted to share them with you
hopefully you got something from this
maybe if it just inspired you to go
declutter something or maybe it's just
you needed someone to tell you some of
these things I know for me it really
works on me I love watching videos on
YouTube of people declutter and
explaining their thought process because
that's what I need to you too so I hope
this was helpful maybe it inspired you
if you do enjoy declutter definitely
check out my declutter videos otherwise
I hope you'll subscribe to catch more of
them and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
