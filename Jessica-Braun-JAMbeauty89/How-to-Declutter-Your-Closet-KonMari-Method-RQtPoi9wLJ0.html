doing a very different kind of declutter
video and I've never done one like this
before I've done similar things like
where I've decluttered my makeup but I
just I'm almost done reading the
life-changing magic of tidying up and if
you haven't read it or you haven't heard
of it
it is truly life-changing and I'm kind
of just now starting my journey with her
but basically the woman that wrote it
Marie Kondo has developed this method of
decluttering or tidying up called the
konmari method which is kind of like an
infusion of her name or an inversion of
her name so I have literally taken out
all of my clothes that I own from socks
to coats
swimsuits shirts dresses everything all
of it is in a pile right next to me here
and I'll show you right now what it
looks like and it's weird to see it
through a camera lens because it doesn't
quite capture the volume of how much
that I own and I've seen friends closets
to mine that are that have way more than
what I do but I also know that I have
way more than what I need and her method
is basically you know she talks about
how people will and I've done this where
all I just have my closet open and I'll
look at it be like okay I'm gonna I'll
take everything out and I'll kind of
look at it on a hanger and decide what
I'm gonna get rid of basically her
methods a little bit different she says
to hold every single piece of clothing
on its own and instead of thinking do I
want to get rid of this she kind of has
two different things to think about the
first one she asks herself does this
item spark joy does this item make me
happy and that's an important one
because there are a lot of ones that I
wear every single day just because I
wear them but they don't necessarily
make me happy so just because I've worn
it a lot recently doesn't necessarily
mean that I have to keep it and that's
one problem I find that I'll wear shirts
that don't really look flattering on me
that I just wear because it's there and
I know it's comfortable which there's
nothing wrong with that and that's not
to say you shouldn't keep clothes but I
do know that I feel that I would be
happier if I were wearing the
that are actually flattering on me that
I own that get lost in my closet so
that's the first question does it spark
joy and the other one is instead of
looking at it and asking yourself do I
want to get rid of this ask yourself
like if I were in a store would I buy
this again so it's kind of like you're
shopping through your collection and
just choosing what do you want to keep
instead of asking yourself what do you
want to get rid of and just that simple
mind trick I think really is going to
really transform the way that I
declutter not only my clothes but my
makeup or my kitchen utensils I mean
everything and she has an order of the
way she kind of goes through things and
her first one is clothing because you
said it's kind of the easiest to go
through and you'll really feel like
you're you kind of get the ball rolling
and everything else kind of falls into
place so those are my plans for what I'm
going to try to do keeping those two
questions in mind does it bring me joy
and do i what do I want to keep not what
do I want to get rid of so I'm going to
show you the after here in just a second
so this is my before picture where I've
pulled every single thing out that I own
and it's weird because just looking at
it doesn't seem like I mean it looks
like a lot but I thought it would look
like more but when I sat in the middle
of it it was so overwhelming and almost
emotional because I realized how many of
these clothes I never wear and I look at
them like oh I spent this much money on
but if it's not making me happy then
what's the point I've already spent the
money on it I've already wasted it and
so now every time I look at it I feel
guilty because I spent that much money
and so it makes me unhappy so I would
rather pass it on and so now every time
I can go in my closet I don't have that
guilty feeling and those articles of
clothing have served a really important
purpose and their purpose was to teach
me to not spend money on things that I'm
not 100% joyful of when I'm buying them
so I've already gotten started and
I wanted to show you guys this is my get
rid of pile right here and these are my
keeps so so far I'm getting rid of a lot
more than I'm keeping but I wanted you
guys to see me in the process just so
you can get an idea because I'm already
feeling empowered and I want you to see
all fast forward through but I want you
to see what it looks like
so this is my pile of clothes that I'm
going to get rid of and this is my pile
of clothes that I'm going to keep I
would say it's probably about 50% which
in the book the lady was saying that
it's usually like 75% that you end up
getting rid of I went through my stuff
twice so I went through it once and then
I kind of looked at the piles and I was
like what like I feel like I'm keeping
so many of them so I went through it
again in like this entire top layer
right here
is all stuff that from the second way
through um I ended up getting rid okay
so now you've seen the before and after
and what I'm keeping and how much I'm
getting rid of and the things I noticed
during this it only took me probably 2
or 3 hours so I honestly thought it
would take way longer in it it didn't
which is good but my first struggle is
right off the bat when I sat down to
start I started instantly thinking the
old way that I'm used to where I was
like well would I ever use this in the
future or you know all those other
things I used to say to myself kind of
that inner dialogue but it took me like
I would say at least 15 minutes to
finally start thinking no does this make
me happy or would I really like what I
buy this again is this something that I
would kind of if I were shopping my
stash that I would really truly want to
keep so it's it's just weird I was
telling Tyler he got home and he's like
are you okay like I was like I don't
know it's like it's just a weird thing
because I've never gotten rid of so many
things that I purchased with my own
money and it's just kind of it's just a
weird feeling a good one but weird and
I'm really excited to hang all these
clothes back up and fold a bunch more I
hang like everything up and I need to be
better you can fit so much more on
drawers and she talks about that in here
too so I'm going to fold a bunch more
that I'm not used to putting in drawers
but I noticed that I buy a lot like when
something's on trend like say like plaid
shirts I bought like four plaid shirts
every time I would see one that I like
and it never fit me right it was always
ill-fitting it was too big but I would
didn't I
by another one and still wasn't quite
right and I finally just the other day
finally found one that fits correctly so
I'm keeping that one and I got rid of
all the other ones I had because I kept
buying it like in pursuit of the one
thing I wanted so I need to be better
about not buying things just because
they're on trend and I want to have it
right now even though it doesn't really
fit me right or maybe it doesn't suit my
body type whatever I need to be better
about that another thing she talks about
in here is avoiding downgrading clothes
to be loungewear and what she means is
that like you know if I've got a like
maybe some sort of like shirt like a
short sleeve shirt that I'm like well
I'm not going to wear this out but I'll
just put it my pajamas wore and it'll
just be like you know loungewear but she
says don't do that because then it just
sits in that drawer and you never wear
it and she said really there's you know
companies that specialize in loungewear
that are even more comfortable have
actual loungewear for loungewear and
then the other stuff just get rid of you
don't need it so and I call myself a
couple times doing that or I was like
well this would be a perfect like sleep
shirt and like no just get rid of it you
weren't used like it's just it's amazing
what we do in our minds with this stuff
I also am a terrible culprit of the how
do I want to say it that I'm going to
keep it just in case
camp like I can't it's so hard I'm like
well what if I need this color swimsuit
to match this other like it literally
half of it makes no sense but you do
that in your mind and you just got to
stop and say there's a reason why I'm
stopping at this piece and thinking do I
really want to keep it then you probably
don't and you probably can get rid of it
I'm also really bad about if I have some
new things and I'm you know if I'm
decluttering like I am now I look at my
just got it but I already know that it
again it doesn't fit well or I tried it
once and it was really uncomfortable but
I keep it just because it's new just to
get rid of it in like four months when I
do it again you know another reason we
hold on too close and I notice this in
myself and she mentions it is that we
you know maybe it was something so
engaged to us and that's the case with a
lot of these like a coat Tyler bought me
it was really expensive that I loved or
you know whatever but for whatever
reason either it's worn out and it
really is time to let it go
or you really didn't like it it was a
gift you got and you just never really
liked me you've always kept it because
maybe your mom gave it to you or
whatever she said each item has a
certain purpose in your life whether
that be that you wear it all the time
and that's its purpose or maybe the
purpose was just that your mom wanted
you to feel loved and she gave you this
gift and that was the purpose she felt
the love when you got the gift but that
doesn't mean you have to hold on to it
now also does it mean you want to go
shopping there tops hey mom remember all
these things you got me I got rid of
them but it's kind of a I think it just
eases my mind when I'm getting rid of
things that were gifts or whatever or
maybe they were sentimental the purpose
they served was maybe just that it made
me feel special for a day or maybe it
was something I bought and it made me
feel joy the day I bought it maybe that
week that I maybe wore it a few times
the first week but then that was his
purpose and maybe that's all it was and
so when you've got a bunch of clothes in
your closet that have outlived their
purpose meaning that you know if their
purse is just to maybe bring you joy and
you never wear it again then it's okay
to get rid of it so it's the way she
explains in the book is so much better
than the way I could ever possibly
explain it but if it sounds weird do you
read the book because it actually really
is a freeing thing and I think that's
why I was able to let go of as much as I
let go of because I've never been able
to let go of all this stuff before
now her idea is that when you tidy up
one time you shouldn't have to do it
again now that's not to say you won't
need to get rid of clothes again but she
was saying you know it really does teach
you a lesson and it kind of helps you
once you find a new home for all of your
stuff you you just never want to put
yourself through that again so you're
just a lot wiser I think in the future
and you also make sure that every single
piece of clothing has a home so you
always feel organized my last thing that
I realize that I do is that there are
certain shirts I've had in my closet for
probably two years and I've never gotten
rid of them because they're really
really cute like really cute but either
again they maybe don't look right on me
or I'm not comfortable in it but I just
keep it in there because it's such a
cute piece of clothing but I never ever
ever ever ever wear it and it makes no
sense and I don't know how I've never
realized that I've been doing that until
now so I finally was like who cares like
I'm the
only one looking in my closet I have no
one to impress and if I'm never wearing
it then why in the world am i letting it
take up space and take up a hangar and
all that stuff and just kind of clutter
my mind just so that I could be like oh
yeah I have cute clothes but I don't
wear them like it doesn't make any sense
so hopefully you enjoyed this video I
know I feel like it was scatterbrained
but maybe that's just because I'm in
this mindset and I feel like I've lost
my mind definitely check out this book
it is it really is life-changing I
bought mine on Amazon for you know I'm
sure five or six bucks and it's worth
every penny if you'd like to check out
my other declutter videos including like
