like bat wings anyway um so today how
did I get that off-track that quickly I
said hey guys and then I was gone
okay hey guys today I'm going to show
you what I do I do this
I would say one to two times a week and
I didn't realize that I kind of always
did the same thing but Tyler kind of
pointed it out my husband so I wanted to
show you what I do like say I get home
from work and where I'm screaming
pretend to I get home from work and
we're gonna go out to dinner that night
or we're meeting our friends somewhere
and so I have like five to 10 minutes to
kind of what I call glam up before going
out and so if I went to work that means
I've got at least somewhat of a face of
makeup and actually today I filmed the
makeup I do when I get ready for work so
if that videos up I will link it but
this is the face that I typically do for
work so I don't think there's anything
wrong with this but when we're going out
especially if it's like for dinner and
drinks I like to kind of glam up a
little bit it's the time I get to play
with makeup and maybe do a different
kind of a lip different kind of an eye
look but often times I'm in a rush and
I'm sure you guys are too so I wanted to
show you what I do without taking makeup
off because usually I've got you know
this makeup on and I'm gonna pile stuff
on top of it so I wanted to show you
what I do so that it looks a lot more
flawless it doesn't look too cakey but
it definitely looks like a different
look for the evening so let's go and get
into it so the first thing I would do is
I would get some powder foundation and
kind of add a little bit more coverage
to my skin so I'm gonna tell you
something that is a big no-no but I'm
gonna share it with you anyway because I
do it and I don't care so one thing I do
to get the most flawless perfect
coverage is to take a powder foundation
not just a powder but a powder
foundation that has coverage and a wet
Beauty sponge and I just straight up
like I'll devote half of the pallet to
that to doing this and I'll literally
just take the sponge and I'll just start
putting it onto my face it adds even
more coverage but the reason I say it's
a big no-no is because you know putting
anything wet into a
powder you know compacts like this it
can mess with the product sometimes it
will get weird it'll get like hard pan
so you know one thing I would recommend
is if you find a foundation or a powder
foundation you like maybe find a cheap
one because I'm gonna tell you this is
not going to last all the way to the end
eventually I will have to say okay it's
time to just get rid of this because it
does end up getting hard pan after a
while but I do this when I travel I do
this one I'm getting ready to go out
because I don't have to go all the way
in and put a whole bunch of foundation
and concealer and all that stuff on but
it just covers everything it is the most
amazing thing but like I said it totally
ruins I would say I could probably use
this still and of course this is not a
cheap one this is the cosmetics CC plush
plus airbrush perfecting powder but like
I said it will over time ruin it it's
not good for it just letting you know
but I'm telling you it is a foolproof
tips so maybe get a cheaper one like I
really like the covergirl a great
advanced radiance this one's not too
expensive so you could use it and then
after a few months maybe just replace it
but but I typically don't use okay I'm
over explaining this anyway so that is
one huge tip the next thing I like to do
is to brighten my under-eye even more so
my favorite way to do that is with my
NYX HD finishing powder so I'm just
gonna get a small fluffy brush this is
in the shade banana but it really does
brighten that area and so I like to do
this because it makes me look and
sometimes I'll even kind of put it up
there but it just makes it look so much
more flawless and again I'm not having
to get concealer out because I don't
have that kind of a time kind of a time
okay the next thing I do is I put
bronzer on and the reason I put bronzer
on is because I feel like it chisels
your face a little bit you know I'm not
gonna do like a true contour kind of a
thing but it also just it makes your
look look more interesting you know what
I mean it adds a little bit of dimension
to your face a little bit of warmth I'm
gonna use my one of my favorites the
number seven bronzer but I'm gonna use
the shade caramel which is deeper than
the one I usually use but that's because
I want that little bit of drama and I'm
using just an angled brush and woah so
I'm just going to kind of apply it here
and then a little bit to that area you
can see how instantly
warming up my face adding a little bit
more interest to it
and I like to grab that same sponge and
kind of blend it in that I was using
earlier with the powder foundation just
to kind of blend it up and in so it
doesn't look like I've got really weird
splotchy areas so I would say by this
point if I weren't explaining what I was
doing I would have only spent like a
minute on those three things total maybe
a minute and a half so it really is
quick the next thing is to reapply
whatever blush I have so or I mean
really by that time in the day my blush
is not always like really standing out
I'm gonna use again the number seven
sorry I've got number seven on the brain
because I'm filming a video about it
here soon so I've got some of them in
front of me but I love this is the shade
peach velvet it's just a really good no
it's not sponsored by number seven it's
just I really do like a lot of the
products and they're right in front of
me so I'm just gonna apply a little bit
there peach Velvets a really pretty
color these are good blushes and I've
really gotten into these like duo fibre
kind of blush brushes this is the sigma
duo fiber powder blush f15 just because
it does a good job of not looking like a
clown face which I appreciate because
I'm not a makeup artist the next thing I
like to do is add a really popping
highlight so maybe if during the day I
was wearing more of a natural ish one
this time I want to put one that's a lot
more glamorous so I'm going to use my
Milani strobe light powder in the shade
afterglow it's kind of a champagne
colored one and it's it's definitely a
such a pretty highlighter but of course
just how highlighting the classic
highlighting areas maybe a little bit on
my nose and sometimes I add a little bit
to my brow bone just to get that area to
glow a little bit more that's another
kind of tip I have because it just kind
of completes that little area and I just
think it looks so pretty on so many
people the next thing I like to do is my
eyes really really quickly so I'm not
gonna take my eye shadow off and I never
do but I do grab kind of a thinner
crease brush you've been watching my
videos for a while I've been obsessed
with this pixie it's Judy time palette
so I like to grab a deep dark color I'm
gonna grab maybe this deeper Brown here
in the bottom row in the middle and just
put it in my outer corner and kind of up
into the crease and what this does is it
real
does add some drama to your eye but I
really didn't have to change that much
about my look and of course I'll need to
blend it and stuff but it really does
add some quick dimension some drama I'll
stop saying drama I'm annoying myself
and what I like about doing this is you
know I'm going to go over my liner
really quickly because you know the
second you start reapplying eyeshadow
it's obviously gonna fall a little bit
into your lashes a little bit but I've
noticed that with the darker shades it
really doesn't make too much of a
difference because you know it's darker
whereas if I'm reapplying a bunch of
shimmer then you really start to see it
in the lashes and then you're trying to
get it out but like I said the darker
ones it doesn't mess with that too much
but it definitely makes your look look
more Vavoom and just to add a to mix to
blend it a little bit more I'm gonna use
this shade here gosh I love this palette
again it's another matte shape and I'm
just gonna kind of blend it up there
and then I'd like to really quickly get
a lighter shade and sometimes I'll even
use like the NYX banana powder because
it is so brightening and just put it
right under my brow bone oh my gosh it's
so brightening no so now that I've kind
of redone that part of my look I like to
grab a liquid liner and add a wing now I
don't do this every single night but it
definitely again adds some drama and so
depending on who I'm going with where
I'm going I like to add a wing if I
didn't already have it plus that gets
rid of any powder enos like there's a
little bit of powder that fell under my
lashes there
and I'm just using the Knicks epic ink
liner my favorite drugstore liner ever
so you know I could keep going with this
but I think it's a good length if I have
the time this is very rare if I don't
pick eyelashes most nights I don't have
the time so I don't put it on but the
other thing I do of course is lips so if
I'm going out to eat somewhere I usually
will just do a really neutral lip or
just like a gloss because I don't feel
like worrying about when I'm eating and
drinking you know but if I'm just going
out for drinks or we're going out to do
something else then I will do a bold lip
but it's just kind of all those things
you have to decide for yourself but I
used to try to do bold lips while go out
to eat them like why am i doing this to
myself you know it's just you're
miserable you're trying to wipe it off
and your napkins covered in it and
you're like how does it look crazy all
night long I'm like it's not worth the
stress at all and so I've just kind of
eliminated that stress so today I'm
going to be using for my lips bombshell
red it's one of the Super Lustrous
lipsticks from Revlon and it's just such
a pretty color I mean right now we're
heading into fall but whenever you're
watching this video it's just a really
pretty color and typically when I'm
running out of time I don't lie my lips
so we're just going to go right in with
it it's really really creamy
the other thing I'd like to do is kind
of try to part my hair a little bit more
dramatically so maybe from the side
farther from the side that is course
it's different depending on your hair
type so this is how I end up clamming up
so I went from this to this and I think
while I don't think it's like I look
completely different
I do feel a lot more like I'm ready to
go out I kind of put in an effort and
like I said I like doing more dramatic
ish I say dramatic I know this is not
dramatic for everyone most people are
like um girl that's like my everyday I
know but for me it is a lot more
dramatic than certainly what I started
with and typically what I wear to work
so hopefully you enjoyed this video
maybe you got a new tip or two if you
have any other tips for getting ready
quickly for a night out when you're kind
of putting makeup on top of makeup
please let us know down below otherwise

see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
