going to give you all some tips on how
you can keep your bedroom or your
apartment or your home smelling as
nicely as possible as cheaply as
possible so I'm going to go over a few
of the things that I use to kind of
create different scents in the spaces
that I use so um one of the things I use
all the time that I feel like people
usually opt for the bath and Bodyworks
ones but I noticed that these work
better and these are these Glade plugins
now first of all disclaimer I know a lot
of people talk about these and they say
you know they might be bad to breathe in
and then you can do a lot of research
online but I kind of just made the
decision because I'd heard about that
after I'd been using these for a while
and you know there's ways especially on
Pinterest where you can kind of mix your
own oils and things like that and I
think that might be something I do in
the future but as of right now I really
love the way these smell they really
smell up the room in a good way of
course and so I don't know to me it's
kind of a decision I've made where I'm
like you know if it's harming me then so
be it
I don't know I you know what I mean it
is one of those things I've decided I
still really like the way they smell so
I still buy them and you can always kind
of stack coupons target coupons with
manufacturer's coupons Finney's
especially right now they have a lot of
coupons out there so I ended up getting
$2 off of this and I really love this
scent Hawaiian breeze
there's also vanilla passionfruit which
I actually have plugged in right now it
smells really good here in my bedroom um
and you can get them with these plugins
now they have the ones that just heat
them up then they have the ones with
fans and they also have the ones that
are lasting impression so you can get
two different scents and it has two
different holders built into one thing
and then it'll basically switch from one
scent to the other every so often
because you know how when you've got one
scent going for a while you kind of
start to not notice it so that kind of
eliminates that factor and so it's a
different scent almost every time you
walk into the house or maybe every day
so it kind of keeps it fresh so you
always do notice that scent when you
walk into your home so these are great
they have so many different scents I
love Christmas time and fall they always
have new sense they have a spring
collection out now but both of these are
color colors well sort of a sense that
they've had for a while but Hawaiian
breeze my apps
a favorite and yeah so I love these so
much and they really because of the fan
I noticed that it really does really
blow up the room with fragrance so I
love it I think you'll be impressed
because I know I was and they to me they
work a lot better and longer than the
Bath and Body Works like the scent ones
and I had those and use those but I
don't know okay another thing that I use
to create a nice fragrance in the room
are these tart warmers and my sister got
me turned onto these and you can buy
tart warmers virtually anywhere um but
here's the thing some tarts of course
you have to buy tarts and the way that I
get the melted stuff out of here is you
know once it's all hardened again at
room temperature you put it in the
freezer and after only like five minutes
you can kind of get in there and it'll
pop right out
it's amazing but Yankee Candle sells
tarts and these are amazing they work
really well you really don't have to use
a whole one you can cut them in half
just to save money and you could
probably get maybe two uses out of them
some people use them for longer but I
really noticed a significant difference
in how much they smell so anyway one of
my favorites lavender vanilla there's
fall festival they have the best fall
sense for when it comes around that time
but they have so many things to choose
from as Yankee it always says but these
are like two dollars a pop now sometimes
there will be sales where they're like a
dollar but I have learned that at
Walmart the Better Homes and Gardens
they sell these tarts I've used two of
them this past Christmas in this six
pack basically and these are like I want
to say like a dollar fifty maybe so it's
a little bit cheaper and you use one of
these you can use two but I usually use
one each time I want to burn one and
they have so many scents they smell
great and they are so fragrant I was
astonished just as much as Yankee Candle
if not more um and I like like Christmas
presents but they also have ones like
spicy sugar cinnamon these are like
dream smells you guys you know those
types where you smell and you're like
that literally smells like heaven right
here I need to go back though because
these are all wintery smells so I need
to go back and get some like more spring
and summer friendly smells
but these are great and these are a
little bit cheaper you don't they last
longer here's there's six of them I love
them and this is a an electric tart
warmer but you can also get the kind
where you light a candle underneath but
I'm like I'm lighting other candles like
it's that's too much work okay one kind
of thing that I don't think really helps
I figured I'd mention it I got this
actually at the dollar store it's my
favorite scent by Glade it's Hawaiian
breeze but it's the kind where you twist
and lift up I know Renuzit sells one of
these and all kinds of brands you can
find the dollar store like I said these
don't work like I even had one of these
in my bathroom a really small you know
space with the door closed thinking oh
well that'll help kind of keep the smell
contained still not smell it and it's
not quite true to the scent either so I
don't know I only spent a dollar on each
of these I bought two so you know I'm
letting it wear itself out but they
don't last very long I haven't noticed a
single bit of this smell anywhere
including in my bathroom so I don't know
if you have a brand of this that you
know works that you really love comment
down below with it because that these
are great for bathrooms there so you
know you don't have to think about it
it's just in there but so far I've not
been impressed at all with these another
thing that I think a lot of people also
causes controversy because it is smoke
if you will but incense and I get I have
like this little incense cone holder I
think I got it like Walmart or Target or
somewhere these are so inexpensive
they're like five to ten dollars
this one's really heavy some sort of
stone really really pretty and you put
the cones in there and light the tips
you can put one you can put four in
there and you can put it back on the
smoke comes through the thing and they
just smell I love the smell of incense
it reminds me of church it reminds me of
okay well arriving Disney World because
in the Morocco pavilion of Epcot I know
I know they always have incense burning
in there and I love it
so I just have a lot of memories tied to
it as well on top of fact that I just
really love the scent so I like incense
cones again you can find this at the
dollar store or any other store they're
like one to two dollars for like a box
it's really not expensive at all and
this is the only box of incense cones
I've ever had to buy because you don't
burn through them that fast cuz I don't
use it that often because I usually will
use
sticks again dollars for sells them but
you can get them anywhere they're so
inexpensive and you can these are like
one two five dollars this one's another
stone one to match that incense cone
holder where you stick it it catches all
the droppings from it they just smell so
nice now if you don't like the smell of
incense you're not going to like this
but I like incense because about a day
after I burned it there's just a really
nice smell it's almost a relaxing Calm
smell about my spaces so a thing to hold
the incense things--these i think this
was around five dollars as well it's got
this little door really kind of cool you
can also put a cone in the bottom there
or if there's little holes yeah yeah
there's little holes there you can stick
your thing and shut the door and then
the smoke will come out if you want to
use an incense stick so this is really
versatile it can be storage but you can
also actually use it so I think this is
a really cool piece again this is like
five or six dollars okay one lad
is this one of the last things I'm
mentioning yeah our candles now I'm
going to talk about my favorite kind of
candles because you know candles can get
really really expensive you know when it
comes to Yankee Candles things like that
yes they smell great and they have a lot
of choices but they're like thirty
dollars a candle right and then Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works I love those and everyone
said well I'll just do it and say I'm
going to do the to 420 dot well now it's
like two for $22 eventually it's going
to be two for $25 and then it's just I'm
gonna be worth it but anyway but
sometimes you can find really good deals
and Yankee Candles at other stores that
sell Yankee like this one I got for like
seven dollars and it's one of the home
classics and it's vanilla berry and it
smells so so good but here's the thing
this one which I talked about before I
got for like a dollar - it's soft cotton
blanket it's by the brand candlelight I
think you can get this at CVS maybe even
Walmart
maybe Walgreens these are so inexpensive
and they smell really fragrant I was so
surprised so I'm definitely gonna buy
some more but if you don't like I know
it sounds silly but you know sometimes
you want to get the name brings you like
the way it looks or things like that so
if you don't want I know this sounds so
silly but you guys know what I mean if
you don't want people to know that
you've got this cheapo brand but it
actually works you can always buy a
holder that you can use time and time
again
and put it in there and no one's going
to be any wiser you know so I love these
holders I get them at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
they always have them on sale especially
around the holidays but or especially
after the holidays I should say they
also have Nichole's
virtually anywhere again all of these
things you can basically get anywhere
which is what's so great about it but
you know it kind of masks it but it also
makes it look so cute you can make them
fit in with your decor you know they
have silver gold they have matte colored
silvers and golds
they have darker ones like this I just
love them I love the holders and I could
buy them time and time again I even buy
them for like my lotion so it's just so
cute
anyway but so those are some of my tips
of ways that I like to keep fragrance in
the house and keep it up smelling really
nice if you have any tips please leave
them down below and if you enjoyed this
please give it a thumbs up let me know
that you enjoyed these types of videos
because this is kind of the first one
like this that I've done so anyway I'll
talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
