have a haul for you mostly drugstore but
a few other things so first I'm going to
start with my um some stuff I got from
shop lately which is my favorite website
and I know I talk about it all the time
but I seriously am so obsessed with it
in fact this necklace I'm wearing is
from shop lately the earrings you can
see them they're kind of like a drusy
stone there but they're like a peach
shade they're really really cool and
then this bangle I got for free from
them like I'd ordered like a couple
times and so like after like four times
ordering or something they'd just like
give you free stuff I don't know
this came in the mail and I was like
what but it's so cute and it's actually
like one of my favorite pieces it's just
got like these gold things that I love
this
oh I just love them and they're so
inexpensive so one of the things that I
got just now in the mail is this cute
they always come in the cutest little
packages but this is this mint green
little bow with like this little detail
in the center and it's actually a clip
if you can see that so what you could
put your hair and like a braid and then
put the bow or you could put it in a
ponytail with the bow like oh my gosh
that's just so cute and these are only a
couple dollars and they have it and
cream as well
and I also have more stuff coming in the
mail from there oops
I tell myself to stop but I just can't
and especially with shop lately their
stuff so inexpensive just like by it's
on the stove so I'll put the link down
below I also ordered like this really
cute like floppy beach hat that's coming
in the mail and then like these
bracelets that are so cute I just can't
wait oh my gosh I could rave about them
all the time but the thing is like you
order from like jewel mint and their
stuff is so expensive and it's nice but
this stuff honestly it's just of the
stuff is just as well made and they have
like bags and hair things and sunglasses
and hats but then most importantly they
have like bracelets and necklaces and
earrings and stuff and oh my gosh I just
love it I love that website and you can
sign up to get their emails and so you
like know what's on sale everyday and
things like that which I'm like on there
all the time like I feel like I'm
constantly looking at the website to see
what's on sale and the best part is even
when things aren't on sale it's like
only a couple dollars more so it's like
you know what I mean it's not even like
it really matters if it's
sale or not oh my gosh I could rave
about it all day I'll stop okay but I'll
be sure to do a video when the other
three things that I ordered come in the
mail because they're so cute and I can't
wait to see them in person
okay um so next we've got some clothes
that I bought these I got actually a
while ago but I haven't worn them yet
attacks on these at the brand Mudd I got
them at Kohl's and they're still there
which is why I'm talking about them
these are so cute and they are so
comfortable they're just like these
all-american classic jeans shorts like
and that's what I was looking for
they're not so short that they're
showing anything but there's still you
know sure you know what I mean
and they're I just love there's a little
bit of distressing but not too much
they're the perfect color of denim I
just love these I can't I've have a
feeling I'm going to be wearing these
like three times a week in the summer
another pair of jean shorts I actually
picked up at Marshall's but they're the
hydraulic ram which is sold at Kohl's
actually and I have been looking for
shorts like these these are just a
little bit longer like they literally
kind of hug your thigh but they go maybe
an inch or two lower so that they're
really kind of covering a little bit
more and I like it because they're a
little bit more coverage but they're not
like mom jeans by any means they're so
cute they almost look like really
shortened pedal pushers you got I mean
like they're like tight around your leg
but they're a lot shorter
I love these okay on to the makeup the
drugstore makeup okay this I found at
the Dollar Tree it's the NYC cheek glow
and it's in Park Avenue plum I haven't
worn it yet I actually just opened it
but it's got its you can barely see it
because it's so like such a just kind of
neutral color but I'm really excited I
think this will be great I'm sweating I
feel like this would be great like just
for everyday it's a very neutral color
so I'm excited about that kind of a very
like officee color so if you have a
dollar tree near you check it out
because I saw these at Target for like
three dollars or so and these are only a
dollar the Dollar Tree and they had a
ton okay so I also picked up some Milani
things and I'm so excited to show you
these okay these are the Milani baked
blush and I heard people talk about
these before now I see why oh my
goodness okay I picked up dolce pink
which is this like almost lightened
berry color now these are very shy
so if you don't like shimmer stray away
I do like shimmer I think it just
especially in the spring and summer just
adds just a little bit of a glow to your
face without even having to worry about
using highlight or anything like that
you know what I mean so the other color
I got was Luminoso which is beautiful I
think this would be even prettier almost
on darker skin tones because it would be
like almost a light wash of color but
it's really pretty even on lighter skin
tones I really like this just like it
reminds me of elves
elfs candid choral which I really really
like so I also picked up the Milani brow
fix brow kit and I got it in light and
they also have dark and that's all I've
seen in stores so if you know that they
have other than that let me know in the
comment box down below because I would
be curious because the light I got it
because yes I had dark hair I know but
this color is very similar to the color
I use now which is the NYX eyebrow cake
powder and taupe and ash and this looked
just like the one I use and I'm looking
for a placement but it's too like
reddish brown for me if that makes any
sense so I might return this and try and
get the dark one and see if there's a
shade in there cuz it's there's a very
pigmented I really really like that
about them so if you're looking for an
eyebrow powder this is great if you can
find a shade good for you I love to the
formula I just haven't found the right
shade yet okie dokie
okay wet-and-wild was on sale buy one
get one 50% off at a store near me and I
was so excited and I finally finally
found this palette I could just cry this
is the palette going in the wild is what
it's called and it has these amazing
it's just such a cool range of colors
like you'd never put these together
especially the mint and the gold like I
love it these are of course I'll swatch
a few of them incredibly pigmented like
ridiculously here's that purple you can
kind of see it oh my goodness like
ridiculous these are all the velvet the
wet and wild shadows are always
incredibly velvety and just beautiful I
was so excited to find this and it was
at a store called near me called Meijer
which I've talked to before I even seen
this anywhere I've heard people seeing
these types of pallets like in Walgreens
I've never found them there so if you
know I know there's a few other pallets
not like the comfort zone and
the purple and the blue one but the
there's a few others like sparkle till
morning or something like that I've been
looking for those forever and I really
want them I'm so sad anyway I finally
found this I've been playing with the
colors I really really like these so if
you can find it I definitely recommend
these are only like five dollars okay I
also got the wet and wild color icon
bronzer and it's in reserve your cabana
and I've owned this I owned this last
year but it shattered after like a day
but I also made the mistake of thinking
it was like a good all-over face color
and putting it all over and then looking
in the mirror and shrieking because I
looked like a shimmering balloon but
it's very sherry and so I've been using
it as a highlight color and it is
ridiculous look at that pigmentation
it's out as well oh my gosh it's so
beautiful
um I don't know if you can see it's so
shimmery the perfect like champagne
colored highlight I will love it I
recommend if you're looking for one this
is only like four dollars got to love
wet wild for that and they're always
kind of on sale every few weeks so like
at Walgreens and CVS so look out for the
sales but Oh also side note this has SPF
of 15 so you're gonna get some nice
coverage right there I'm not gonna get
new sunburn there wouldn't it be
ridiculous can you imagine okay I
already showed you that at Target I
picked up the maybelline color whisper
and lust for blush so pretty
hi this is the first one that I've
gotten of the color whispers now I love
this this color is the most perfect
everyday color I know I already have a
lip color on today I'm wearing Revlon
pink in the afternoon it's one of my
favorite favorite Revlon I think it's
the Super Lustrous line it's like my
favorite Revlon color so yeah and I also
picked up the pink punch Baby Lips I was
a little disappointed I can't even deny
it's Pinker I mean it's gonna look share
in the swash yeah I mean you can see it
but it looks a lot Pinker on my lips for
whatever reason and I was excited to get
it because it doesn't have an SPF and so
it's like Oh perfect like it won't dry
my lips I like the other baby lips that
I own have but it's just too pink for
what I'd wanted it for so it's a nice
pink color if you like pink you'll
probably love this and it smells awesome
but it's just not quite my favorite I'll
still probably wear it but not
as often as I'd hope okey-dokey so I
also got the elf I saved the packaging
although I've already used this elf
small angled brush you probably can't
see that but it's just this awesome it's
their studio line so they're three
dollars just this awesomely thin brush
I've been using it for my gel eyeliner I
am in love with this brush if you're
looking for one for your gel or cream
eyeliner this is the one for you it's
three dollars you can you beat that and
target has them in store of course you
can always go to islip space comm and
find them but then you gotta pay for
shipping
okay so last few things are nail
polishes and I know I shouldn't still be
buying nail polishes I shouldn't still
be buying any of this but you know you
know like I just can't stop myself and
these were on sale and I had $2 off
coupons for all of these $2 off I don't
even know where I found these coupons
it's like the best deal ever and I use
the last of them it's kind of sad and
they were good too like June but this is
I'm wearing this today actually on my
nails I have the Revlon scented of
course strawberry cream nail polish and
then this is this one it's called Golden
Rule and it's just this really pretty
opaque like champagne gold and it's if
you're looking for one like this I
really recommend this cuz it's beautiful
I love the way it goes on I just love
this and these are like six or seven
dollars depending on where you go see if
you can get them on sale they're always
on sale all this stuff is always on sale
love this I got another glittery polish
this is in copper penny and again it's
the Sally Hansen complete salon manicure
line these oh my gosh it's gonna be
beautiful for fall and don't get me
started on fall because I could talk
about fall all day long I just okay
I'm just in a fall mood which I know
makes no sense because it's spring but
fall is the best time of year and
yesterday's weather I was working a
catering gig and it was it felt like
fall outside and I was so cold but the
same I'm like oh I can't wait till fall
and we saw like the rest of spring and
summer to get through and I love summer
and I love spring but seriously you guys
fall is the best time of year and if you
disagree well that's all right but I
love fall another fall color is this
sally hansen insta-dry in pronto purple
I can't wait to wear this I'll probably
wear it before fall let's be serious but
I think these would kind of be cool
gather don't you think like maybe maybe
probably gonna try that soon anyway so
excited about all these and I think
