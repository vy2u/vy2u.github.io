have a haul for you I have some shoes
and some jewelry that I've bought
recently and some other things as well
as a bunch of elf makeup that I just
recently I recently made a purchase on
elfs website which is eyes lips face
calm and it just came in and I've gotten
to play with a lot of it and some of it
I'm wearing today so I'm excited to tell
you about it so we'll start with some of
the jewelry one thing that I recently
bought are these really really cute
little pink sparkly bow studs and they
they remind me of Minnie Mouse of course
but I just love them I think they're so
cute they were only like four dollars on
shop lately calm which I can link down
below I bring it up all the time because
it is my favorite website to buy jewelry
on because it's also cheap but I just
fell in love with these I do I wear
studs I think a lot more often than I
wear other earrings although I wear like
dangly earrings all the time too so you
know anyway so then I also got this is
from Target this bracelet and I think
I've posted this on Instagram and a lot
of people were loving it and I love it
too it's this like actually baby blue it
came across as like mint green but it's
actually a baby blue and it just
tightens you know where you can hold one
and just pull the other and it tightens
so it actually fits any size wrist I
think but I love the GOL that remains
reminds me of ancient Egypt which I used
to be so obsessed with when I was in
like high school and middle school but I
just I think it's so pretty and then I
also kind of in that same vein got this
necklace from shocked lately calm I
think I've already worn it in a video
but it's just so cute it's three tiers
of this gold and this again like a baby
blue color I hope this is doing it
justice because it is so pretty but I
love it I've worn it so much it goes
with so many different things I just
love it so those are the jewelry
purchases I've made I also bought these
shoes from Target which I am so excited
about they are this camel color I wear
camel color shoes all the time and I
just recently the pair I've been wearing
for like two or three years are just
shot like they're just done so I found I
was so excited to find these and they
were on clearance and I had a five
dollar off coupon off of a moroni shoe
purchase so these were on clearance for
13
and I had a five dollar off coupon so I
got him for what like nine dollars I was
so excited they're just so cute I love
the little gold studs they have them
around the back as well they're really
really comfortable and camel goes with
anything I mean truly this this is one
of those pairs of shoes where I can just
like have an outfit on and no they don't
match unless it's like all-black and
even that I think it could still work
but I'm loving those okay another thing
I found a good deal on it was like three
dollars on clearance but it's not this
store near me called Meyer and they're
not everywhere but really what I wanted
to show you it's a jewelry case like for
traveling and I've been looking for one
of these that isn't like $60 and you
know I know they have a bunch online but
I haven't found what I love this one is
awesome because it's light pink on the
inside and it's got like this area here
where you can drape like necklaces
around it and then tuck them into here
you can use it for bracelets and then
that's got this board here with little
holes which is for you know like
earrings and things like that and then
it's got this oh I'm skip this then
there's this like pouch here in the
middle that zips up you can stick
whatever you need to in there and then
this side is the side I haven't shown
you there's another thing that unsnaps
so you can slide bangles or bracelets
whatever you want and then snap it back
so they're kind of attached in there and
then there's another zipper pouch so you
can fit a ton in this it's just kind of
like this pleather tight feel you know
to it and black but I love the pink on
the inside I love how much organization
there is it was $3 but anyway the point
of me showing you this I know it no one
will really necessarily be able to find
this but it's just that there are so
many really cool organizers on I've seen
a bunch on eBay and Amazon that are
really not that expensive and it really
helps if you get stressed like I do when
you're packing trying to make sure every
outfit is perfect and you've got
everything you could possibly need this
is really helpful for storing all your
jewelry and I'm gonna do a travel type
video soon when I travel hopefully soon
and I'll show you how I organize what I
pack okay another thing these are some
things my boy who brought me and again I
posted this on Instagram
he bought me because I finished my
semester and I have one more year of
school left but this is a really
different
semester and so he got me some gifts to
congratulate me on ending my semester
and so he got me this Minnie Mouse towel
it's I mean it's really long I'm not
gonna be able to show you the whole
thing but it's really really cute with
the light pink polka dots and then it
has my name embroidered on it and he got
a Mickey Mouse one for himself with his
name embroidered on it so cute and then
he also got me this Minnie Mouse little
tumbler it's the light pink and he also
got himself a matching Nicky Mouse one
so I told you guys he's just as obsessed
with Disney as I am in fact I think he's
the one that got me really started going
on this obsession so you're gonna blame
anyone blame him anyway okay on to my
Elf fall I'm so excited to show you guys
these things so I picked up two
different brushes one that I picked up
is the elf powder brush now I've had
this before but I kind of ruined it
because I used it for foundation and I
really didn't clean it out nearly enough
and so I just tossed that I was like
this is just done I tried washing I
would not come out so this actually
feels different than when I first bought
it it doesn't feel as dense but it's
still really really soft I actually use
this to apply another thing of makeup
that I'm going to show you here in a
second but I just really like this it's
good for powder products but you can
also use it for liquid products just
make sure you clean it out and then I
also got this flawless concealer brush
and it's real small and it's perfect for
I used it to apply like a finishing
powder over my concealer here it's the
perfect size for that it's also perfect
for adding like highlight if you want to
add highlight this would be a great
brush as well so I love both of these
I'm really excited to have this one
again and I was so excited about this
one okay so I also the thing that I
mentioned that I used this powder brush
with was this elf mineral foundation and
I got it in the shade light it has an
SPF of 15 and it's real it's just like
bare minerals you know where it's got
the powder in there but I'm what I did
is I shook it into the lid which I just
did again don't waste it anyway and then
I use the powder brush actually to buff
it into my skin
that's all I'm wearing today on my face
other than some concealer and like you
know blush but I didn't wear any liquid
foundation any primer anything and I
noticed my face
a little dewier than I usually have I
don't know if that's being picked up on
camera but I kind of love it and in this
summer your phrase is gonna be doing
anyway so you might as well beat it to
the punch right I kind of I'm looking in
the mirror that's why I'm not looking
right at the camera I kind of really
like the finish I think it's a little
bit too dark for me but at the same time
I'm gonna be getting color as the summer
moves on so I'm not too upset about I
think this was five dollars so a little
pricier than what they usually charge
but there's a ton of product in here I
have a feeling I will be repurchasing
this and it applied really nicely with
the ELF powder brush so think about it
the powder brush is three dollars this
is five that's a really nice face for
eight dollars Carolina and this is my
first experience with any sort of
mineral foundation I've never used it
before so okay
powder I got the elf High Definition
powder but this one is not in the
typical translucent or in the white this
is in the BA yellow I think it's
supposed to be comparable to the fan nye
luxury banana powder that they have that
a lot of people now I've never bought
that I've never used it but I know a lot
of people set their concealer with that
yellow colored powder just to kind of
add even more highlight and even more
color correction to that area so this
was $6 a lot of times and what I did
there's a studio elf Studio line there's
like a 50% off coupon code you can use
so I got all the elf Studio products for
50% off so I ended up getting this for
three too bad but um I really really
liked it I set my concealer with this
today I think it's really nice I don't
notice like an actual yellow tone or
anything but I do notice that my
concealer seems to stay on pretty nicely
so I would recommend it I'm sure if I
ever run out of that which is doubtful
because it is filled
I would probably repurchase it another
thing I got another powder for setting
the under is the elf high definition
under eye setting powder it's just a
little thing of white very finely milled
powder I actually have not used it yet
comes with a little brush but it's so
tiny like you'd never be able to
actually I don't know anyway but this is
I would use this elf $3.00 concealer
brush for this and be perfect but again
you set your concealer with it
helps your concealer from creasing it
keeps it from creasing I should say and
it's just it's nice this reminds me of
the Tarte Amazonian clay finishing
powder that I use all the time to set my
under eye but again like I said I
haven't used this yet so I don't know
but I would bet it's pretty nice another
thing that is in the bulkiest I mean a
lot of their packaging seems to be
pretty bulky but this is the bulkiest of
bulky it's the elf conditioning lip balm
SPF 15 it's in mellow melon and I love
it I'm not wearing it it looks similar
to what I'm wearing on my lips today but
not as striking it's this nice melon
color it's a lip balm I like it and my
lips have been soft I've used it for
like two or three days now but um the
packaging is just so big for what it is
like why it's almost as big as my entire
hand and when I put it my purse attacks
up so much room I'm like what the heck
quick but I think these are comparable
to the Mac tender tones which you I
can't find ever unless they're
re-released you know what I mean so
these are great they have a lot of
different shades and I'll probably buy
another shade of this cuz I do really
like the finish it has SPF of 15 so it's
win-win and SPF usually drives my lips
out but I haven't noticed that drying it
out yet so that's also great okay so I
got the elf contouring blush and
bronzing powder or blush and bronzer and
this is in let me check yeah I'm still
recording
just making sure this isn't turks and
caicos did I butcher that no I don't
think I did anyway
they have a lot of in the stores they
usually only have one set of colors but
online they have a lot more and this is
the lightest or like it's almost like a
bronzy colored blush and it's really
really nice I'm wearing it today I
really like it I think it it's like a
blush without being a blush because it's
not too pinky tone I really like it I
haven't used the bronzer because I know
it's gonna be probably way too dark for
me I'll swatch it for you guys yeah just
a little too dark just a little bit but
I really got it for this blush color cuz
I think it is so pretty now I'm gonna
find a place to wipe this off oh look
how dark look how dark that is that's
great I'm just trying to wipe it off and
it's like not gonna but you know what
ladies if you have darker skin tone you
I mean that
be a beautiful bronzer but for me oh man
I would look like a hot mess okay
another oh I did get another brush I'm
such a liar it's the eyelash and brow
wand it's just it's great that's what I
have one of these already and I bought a
second one they're only a dollar I use
them to comb through my brush through my
brows after I after in before I guess I
put any eyebrow color onto it so I
really love these they're a dollar you
really can't beat it and they are great
I've had the one I've had for like a
year and a half and it's in perfect
condition so so this one I got the
eyebrow liner and filler that I thought
yeah I guess so so that I got the color
light I think it was yeah and it's just
this it's a pencil of course kind of a
taupe color I'm hoping it works in my
brows a lot of times they'll pull like
red and I don't like the way that looks
on my brow so I'm always looking for
more of a gray toned taupe color so I'm
hoping this will do the trick I haven't
tried it yet I'm honestly nervous to try
because I'm so picky about it and then
this is the lifter which you put under
the brow as like a highlight not lifter
yeah that's what they call it I'm crazy
you guys but you know it's kind of a
concealer shade you can put it under
your brow just to kind of lift the brow
but also just to kind of add a nice
highlight there so that's pretty cool
and it comes with a self sharpener which
i think is great especially for travel
okay so I also got a pan eyes shadow
it's a golden glow I was hoping it would
be somewhat of a dupe for the Urban
Decay half-baked eyeshadow that I love
this in the original Naked palette and
you can get it single as well but
they're so expensive but it's like I
wear it everyday I'm wearing it today
but this is a lot more of like a camel
colored shadow I'll probably still use
it but it wasn't what I was expecting is
also very interesting but of course
highly pigmented and the last thing that
I got is the elf eyelid primer and
champagne and actually I'm going to pull
it out this is the first time I've tried
one of their colored eyelid primers and
I always use like their sheer one but
here it is if you guys
see it um I that's kind of nice it's a
little darker than I'd anticipated I
hope you guys can see that on the camera
but I like it it's an interesting color
I think that'll be really nice I feel
like this is the color you just put all
over your lid and be done you know what
I mean if you really want it so anyway
that is all that I bought from elf and
from Target and shop lately and stuff
I'll link some of those things down
below and as well as the elf website and
I hope you enjoyed this and if you did
please subscribe I'll see you guys later
