have a Sephora haul for you guys I have
not done a Sephora haul in like a really
really long time I mean truly cuz I
don't really know why I feel like I've
picked up a few things here and there
but it's been a very long time since
I've just gone to sephora and bought a
bunch of stuff and I have done just that
and I'm really excited to share it with
you guys because there's some things I
hadn't heard about it all and then some
of them are like cult classics that I've
just been wanting to try for a really
long time and I'm really excited to
review for you guys just to see if
they're really worth all the hype or not
and hopefully a video on that will be
coming up soon so I've got my classic
Sephora bag let's dig in this is
actually a combination of two different
trips one was like the main trip and
then another one I'd done a few weeks
ago i just bought like I think one maybe
two things online and then i also got
like 100 point perk and that was from a
few weeks ago but most of this will be
from just the other day okay um so the
one from a few weeks ago i'll go ahead
and show you first the first thing I
bought was the Urban Decay b6 setting
spray or I guess no it's actually a prep
spray and this is basically just a pre
makeup spray and supposedly it's got all
kinds of vitamins in it and it's really
good for your complexion I've tried it a
few times this is the smaller size of
course the little more inexpensive I've
tried it a few times and I don't know it
does seem to even out my complexion just
a little bit but I don't think it's
anything like life-changing and I don't
know that I noticed a difference when I
use this before my makeup and when I
don't I don't know that I noticed a
difference but I've only used it a few
times so I'm gonna keep trying it and we
shall see what I think eventually okay
another thing I got on that trip was
buxom the buxom lip gloss and white
russian and this is just a really really
nice neutral kind of pale peach color
and what I love about the buxom lip
glosses is that they smell like mint and
they feel tingly if you don't like that
tingly feeling you will hate this but if
you don't mind it or you like it you'll
love these and I really like that
feeling just because it almost feels
like it's a chapstick but it's really
glossy and pretty so I think that's the
best of both worlds and I was really
I need to finally own this and this is
one of those cult classic products so
all right and then the 100-point perk
that I had gotten that day for spending
this was a buxom lip gloss in dolly and
this one of course is half the size it's
like a smaller one and this is a little
bit more of a deeper color but it's
still pretty sheer when you apply it but
it's a nice kind of light berry color I
would call it I really like it oh that's
a cute little baby one so on my main
sephora trip the first thing i knew i
wanted to pick up was the tarte
amazonian clay full coverage foundation
and I got it in the shade let me look at
the box here fairlight honey which says
it's for fair to light skin with peach
undertones I'm wearing today and it
matches my skin flawlessly and this one
I love the packaging this has got this
cute little wooden handle and you know I
don't love that it's a squeezy to but I
would prefer that over just an
open-mouth bottle so I'd prefer that of
course pump is ideal but regardless this
is a very very thick consistency I
applied it with a sigma brush any of
them and it seems to blend out really
really nicely i ended up putting a
really light layer on and then wanting a
second layer so it's certainly full
coverage if you want it to be but you
can't apply it in a lighter way and just
blend it out more if you really wanted
that but i like it um i was really
excited to finally try it because again
this is one that has been really really
hyped up i need to try it a few more
times to really decide but it kind of
has a satin finish it doesn't it's not
completely modified i use the mac fix+
over it though at the very end so i
don't know if that's why it looks a
little dewier or what but i'm going to
try it the other way to and see but i
really like it ok another tart product
that i picked up was the mayor kuja
creaseless concealer and this I got in
the shade fairly light neutral and it is
it is light but that's what I'd prefer
and I'm wearing it today I applied it
with a brush but I think I want to try
it with a few different ways because I
didn't love the way to apply but it does
have really really good coverage and it
certainly is brightening however I will
say I did notice creasing right here and
here like within minutes of applying it
and I had set it with the powder and
everything so I thought that was
interesting because creaseless is in the
title but again this was
used it once so we'll see as I continue
to use it how it wears with my skin and
maybe it's just my skin but it did
crease so I thought that was kind of
interesting ok another product that i
got this is when I hadn't heard anyone
talk about this is the bare minerals
ready eyeshadow 8-point oh and it is in
the palette is in the shade power
neutrals and it's eight point 0 because
there are eight shadows in it and this
is just chock full of beautiful
beautiful neutral shadows it's got this
nice like olive green there a few
shimmers but mostly all of them are Matt
and you can do almost any look with this
at least any neutral look and i love how
sleek then thin the packaging is it's
got kind of that the way the NARS
packaging feels it's kind of modified
and like soft and gets dirty really
easily that type of packaging which I
really like and it's got the shade names
on the back to which I also like so I
was really excited about this one and I
haven't I've never bought any bare
minerals I shadows at all so this is
kind of my first go around that I'm
wearing today I didn't do anything crazy
which you guys know me but I really like
it so far and it's going to be so
perfect for traveling another product i
got was what i'm wearing on my lips
today which is the classic classic NARS
applause in Turkish delight it's just
this light baby pink very very neutral
but I don't think it's too much you
don't look like completely washed out
but you it's like borderline which I
kind of think is fun and this is of
course the one that like Kim Kardashian
made famous a couple years ago and she
when that was like all she'd wear for a
while anyway I was excited to finally
try it I don't think there's anything
revolutionary about the quality or the
formula of this lip gloss but I do
really like the shade I want to look and
see if I can find a drugstore dupe I'm
sure there are a million out there I
would just google search and I'd find
them but I kind of want to try and find
one myself for this because since the
formulas not anything revolutionary I
don't think you necessarily need to
spend all the money to get the NARS
brand anyway these are all like many
reviews in here and the last thing i got
in this hall was the benefit coralista
blush and i don't own any benefit
blushes I own the hoola bronzer but I
don't end own any of their blushes this
is
it's just an absolutely beautiful coral
shade of blush very very pigmented can
be powdery I mean once you blend it in
it doesn't look powder but it does kick
up a decent amount of powder so it's
something to just be aware of but i
think the packaging is adorable it
smells nice and i mean it lasts all day
and i are I've worn it twice now and I'm
wearing it today to kind of blend it out
um it really lasts all day it's crazy it
really is and it smells good mmm I just
love it i'm so excited to it finally i
just ordered the sugar bomb 12 because i
swatched it in sephora and I was like oh
I need that I need that now so I was
contacted by ebates because I as you
guys very well know love ebates and I
talk about them all the time and I've
never been one I'm still not affiliated
with them I just have like a referral
code which anyone can get as long as you
have just a free ebay account so I've
always had a referral code but I've
never been affiliated never been
contacted by them or anything so I was
contacted by them because I'd been
referring a lot of you guys to their and
they you know kind of found out and said
hey do you want to do a giveaway on your
channel will give you a fifty dollar
gift card to give away and I was like
yeah I'm gonna do that the so the reason
they wanted to kind of work with me is
because right now they're having a
Sephora eight percent cash back on
ebates I'm just not realizing I haven't
told you what II base is all about it
bakes is basically just you get cash
back when you shop online and the only
thing you have to do is once you've
created your free ebates account you
just have to remember and this is the
hardest part for me you have to remember
to go to ebates first then search for
whatever story you're wanting to buy
from Sephora amazon ulta whatever it is
Walmart and click on the link on ebates
once it takes you there it will track
what you buy and then you'll get cash
back and it pays out I don't know how
often it they pay out I feel like it's
like once every three months or
something like that but it adds up
really quickly it says especially if
you're like me like I've I sep from
amazon its aura and ulta and all kinds
of stores all the time online because
I'm I just feel like I'm so busy during
the week and even on the weekends that
if there's something I need I'll just
ordered on amazon
order from Sephora and just wait for it
to come instead of spending time go to
the store that sounds very lazy but I'm
just being honest with you guys anyway
so because they're having this eight
percent cash back in 24 which is higher
than it usually is they figured it'd be
nice for me to feature it let you know
get their name out there but also you
guys know that i love you bait so i was
excited to feature it so the
fifty-dollar sephora gift card that they
are letting me give away to you guys the
information on how to enter will be
below it will be really easy i do know
though that you have to be an ebates
member if you win so you know if you
were to win the giveaway they have to
double check that you're an ebates
winner or at ebay 10 you can get the
fifty dollar gift certificate to sephora
which oh my gosh fifty dollars you can
get the Naked palette for free you could
get you know two of the things I got or
a few you know who I love support i love
gift cards is so exciting anyway so I'm
excited for you guys to enter good luck
I'll put all the info blow it'll be
really easy to enter I promise and I
will catch you guys very very soon bye
hold on uh-huh ichinose I'm not making
