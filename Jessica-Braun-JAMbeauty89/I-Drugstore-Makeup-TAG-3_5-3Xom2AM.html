going to be doing the I heart drugstore
makeup tag and I think this was created
by makeup by Ali if that's what her name
is
so I've got them the questions pulled up
this was I think I've only done a couple
of tag videos maybe only one maybe two I
don't know but this has been the most
fun to prepare for because first of all
I have like there's like you know
however many questions but eight
questions and I'd like to for everything
maybe even three like it was so much fun
but hopefully you guys will get some
good ideas of some great drugstore
products out there some maybe not so
great and of course keep in mind these
are my opinions it's because I have a
different skin tone than some of you
have different eyelashes different lips
so some people are gonna love something
products that I hated and vice versa so
you know go into that go into this
knowing that so okay so the first
question is what's your favorite
drugstore makeup brand overall no way I
can pick just one just period there's no
way but if I had I want to say
Maybelline and that surprised me because
when I first started really kind of
getting into makeup
I loved Revlon and I still do but
Maybelline they have concealers that I
love mascaras I love lip products I love
I haven't really tried I mean I like
some of their face products but I
haven't tried enough of them I don't
think I have the BB cream which is okay
but I really want to try the superstay
makeup which I'm going to be trying soon
but I've never tried that so but I think
overall Maybelline has more products
across the board that I love so number
two what's your favorite face cheek and
lip products so for face I'm gonna
surprise you guys because I don't have
any foundations to show I have some that
I love but when I really thought about
it
this wet wild color icon bronzer in
reserved your Cabana I used as a
highlight and I use it today it's like a
candle light type of glow like it
doesn't shimmer on your face it just it
just makes it glow like if you're
looking for a dewy look this is gonna be
a great product for you and you don't
really have to think about it and you
can't really go wrong with it because
it's not so shimmery it doesn't it
doesn't look crazy on your face even if
you kind of don't apply it right you
know what I'm saying so um I really like
this it's like three or four dollars you
really can't beat that and then another
drugstore fake face product is the NYX a
matte but not flat powder foundation I
just mentioned this in a previous video
where that it was just a rediscovered
favorite I'd already hit pan on it in
the past but it's just I've kind of been
moving away from wearing as much
foundation and I'll go with just powder
foundation someday just moisturize and
throw on something like this and I don't
know I really really like it it's it
doesn't look cakey on my face and if it
does look at the interface you can
always spray it with even just water but
any kind of facial spray I really really
like this and these are they're under
$10 you can get them at Ulta or online
okay so favorite cheek products I again
have two not specifically necessarily
these colors but the wet and wild
blushes are only 399 they have a few
colors this one's in pearlescent pink
these are so so pigmented just beautiful
they last all day like seriously they
last longer than pretty most of the
high-end blushes that I have and then
also the elf studio blushes these are
three dollars there's a bigger color
selection online this one's in candid
coral again highly pigmented they last
all day I just I love them and that's
the thing drugstore blushes especially
when it comes to those two brands are
honestly better than most the high-end
blushes I can't speak highly enough
about them you really can find what you
need in the drugstore you don't have to
buy high-end okay lip products that I
love oh I'm like making my throat like
sore already and we're just getting
started
yes okay so the maybelline color whisper
I love this one's in lust for blush
which actually I'm wearing on my lips
today it's just like a I don't know
really simple you don't need to be here
for it I just love the color whispers in
general and then the Revlon lip butters
are just posted a picture on Instagram
of and this was in peach parfait you
guys know is my favorite I guess I could
swatch this one it's just like a
shimmery they're kind of a golden
shimmer to it but it's just like a nice
light coral color
love those so those are some drugstore
favorites there and with those that's
pretty much anything in the line of that
you know what I mean okay
least favorite product is question
number three there I have a few and I
need to do what products I regret buying
video again because I've already done
one but I need to do another point this
is the elf cream eyeliner I might even
mention this in my first products I
regret buying video it's just it's not
my cup of tea when it comes to cream and
gel eyeliner I've been using gel
eyeliner for a very long time and I'm
very very picky about it and this one
just didn't do it for me it's only three
dollars so one that big of a deal but I
just didn't like it I mean I don't know
I understand there's Maybelline has a
great one and so does L'Oreal L'Oreal's
the one I've been using for a while now
and those are maybe double the price but
it's worth it they last forever so
number four what's the best makeup
bargain this is a fun question too and
it has to be frankly anything from wet
wild is an incredible bargain or elf but
this this one won't cover all I have
been wearing every day yet again I'm
wearing today I'm pretty sure I've
mentioned this in every video like the
past week or two it is incredible and
it's like three ninety-nine and someone
on Instagram a friend of mine had
recommended this and I can't thank her
enough because I love it and it is so
cheap and this is great because it kind
of seems that it's you know just in
plastic except for how perfect is that
for travel and it comes oh I almost got
foundation all over a whole month yeah I
almost got this a little ride man um it
comes with a sweetie too which is great
if you apply with the Beauty Blender you
can just squeeze it on top you're not
getting your fingers messy at all like
it's awesome
the only problem is you might have
trouble finding a color that matches you
so I got lucky and it just happens to
match for the most part but of course if
it's too light you can warm it up with
bronze room you can mix it with other
colors but then then that kind of
defeats the purpose so I don't know I
love this stuff oh man I love it oh okay
here we go what's your favorite underdog
okay I have three oops prod it says
something that you love that often gets
overlooked and a lot of these have been
mentioned by other people it's not that
they're never mentioned but it's that
they're not mentioned enough
for how great they are so the first one
is the Physicians Formula matte
collection quad these are eye shadows in
its in Canyon classics and these are all
matte shades I honestly grabbed for this
quite a few times a week because it's so
easy I pretty much always travel with
this because there's just it's just the
easiest I you can darken it up but then
it's like daytime it's oh and they're
also like incredibly pigmented I guess I
can show you guys some of them they're
so beautiful um I just I love this and
these are like five or six dollars and
there's a few others I want to get the
one in rose quartz cuz emily noel has
brought that up before and i want to try
that these are beautiful and then also
the maybelline one by one no one really
talks about it and i love it and it's
got a really flexible brush which i
thought I would hate but for days that
you're just kind of being really simple
and you just want to have like soft
flirty lashes this is the perfect
mascara you might want to put on a few
coats of it but other than that I love
it I think it's just your lashes stay
soft it stays on all day for me it holds
the curl I love it and people should
give it a try because and you know what
else is great for for reapplying so no
matter what mascara you put on in the
morning sometimes those harder mascaras
like the rocket which I love it you
can't really put on the rocket again
like halfway through the day but this
will glide over any mascara halfway
through the day if you just kind of want
to amp up your look this is a great
reapplication mascara my throat is like
seriously so are you guys okay so the
maybelline instant age rewind in the
brightener people who used to talk about
this and no one does anymore i use this
every day for my highlighter not
everyday but pretty much every day and i
just kind of do a V here and then I go
out and then I blend it out with my
Beauty Blender with my fingers with my
Sigma brush it's incredible and I need
to rebuy it these are kind of pricey
though I mean they're like 10 bucks it's
not that bad but still but I use this
thing like crazy oh my gosh so if you
haven't tried this and you're looking
for kind of a brightener I'll put on
whatever concealer then this on top it's
amazing and people and there's also like
treatment in it I mean I don't know that
I necessarily know
a huge difference but I do I just love
it I just love it okay hold on my iPad
keeps like turning off um ooh a
drugstore product that's overpriced I'm
gonna mention this but no but it's one
of my absolute favorites it's the
covergirl in La simply ages concealer
some places this is like 10 some places
this is like 14 it's expensive for what
it is however I would I would die
without it I really think I would and my
friend amber who just recently sent me a
bunch of stuff sent me a bunch of these
and that was awesome
because these are incredible there I'll
just show you BAM
isn't that crazy it's the most
moisturizing thing it blends seamlessly
I just put it there it's gone here let
me do it again
so there it is there I put it on it
blends out so beautifully I'm wearing on
the rise today actually I have this
paired with the brightener that I just
showed you it's my favorite and actually
pretty much everyday if you're wondering
I'm probably wearing these two in
conjunction with each other they're
amazing
this is overpriced though well I would
still even if it were $20 I'm gonna be
honest with you guys I've been so buy it
because a it lasts forever
I've been using this for a long time and
I'm like no where near pan but oh my
gosh it's amazing if you guys still
haven't tried it and you've been
watching my videos you need to go out
and buy it because a it's amazing it be
it's amazing also it's amazing okay so
the next question is ooh show your best
drugstore dupe okay here we go guys so
Stila kitten is amazing and you can't
downplay how good this shadow is if you
haven't heard of it it's um it breaks
easily and actually if your thing breaks
but I had to do it kind of shattered
when I got it in the mail you just kind
of spray it with some like rubbing
alcohol or something like that and then
press it down with whatever you have
that could press it down and then just
let it dry and it'll be fine
so I had to do that and it's been fine
and I've had this now for a couple years
okay Wow
right so let me I'm gonna swatch this
for you beautiful it's so shimmery it
stays on all day it's like the most
iridescent there
getting on my chin probably however I
have found a drugstore do that is
literally every bit as beautiful it is
the Loreal 24-hour infallible shade and
iced latte they have so many colors of
this but it comes with this little like
stopper because it is kind of a pressed
pigment but it really functions just as
an eyeshadow I mean it's not usually
it's more pressed down than this mine
got kind of broken up but okay I'm going
to swatch it on a different finger Wow
it's down I'm gonna dump it everywhere
so there's Cielo kitten right now so
this is Cielo kitten this is the l'oreal
iced latte they are both gorgeous
frankly I think the iced latte the
L'Oreal wants even more pigmented and
when I wear them on my eyes I really
can't tell the difference it looks like
this one's a little bit more rosy than
this one but when it comes to putting it
on your eyes with other looks they have
the same effect they're gorgeous Stila
kitten is like I want to say it's like
18 dollars somewhere around there and
the L'Oreal one is like I'm like eight
maybe I really don't know they're
gorgeous and they have so many different
colors but iced latte is my favorite and
I think those are a good dupe so if
you've been wanting to see the kit and
give the Lorie I wanna try because it's
way cheaper and really it's the exact
same thing okay so the very last
question is drugstore product that isn't
worth the hype but I have two one I
mentioned before it's the NYC sunny
bronzer really the only reason I don't
like it is cuz it's too dark for my skin
I mean you can I've made it work and
I'll still wear from time to time just
to give it some time you know what I
mean just to give it some more tries but
at the end of the day it is too dark for
me I have to work a lot harder with this
whereas if I use another bronzer like my
hula one or any other one that I own I
don't have to work as hard to blend you
know so it's still okay I'm not gonna
like throw it out but for me it's a
little too orange so that's one that's
not work too high but the other one kind
of makes me sad is this one the
Physicians Formula
Organic where and the only beef I have
with this I've only worn it like twice
so in all fairness I'm still going to
give it a lot more tries but I think one
of the selling points and why people
like this is the
it's a very touchable or not touchable
like soft it keeps your lashes really
soft which I don't mind except for it
made my eyelashes are like where my
eyelashes meet it made them itch and so
when I would go to kind of itch it like
right you know like on the lashes the
base of the lashes I would get mascara
all over my hand like in my nail because
it like it's like it never fully dries
and I'm sure that has to do with the
fact that it is using more natural
ingredients things that are better for
your lashes which I understand and
perhaps and maybe as it dries out more
maybe I'll start to like it maybe it's
one of those types of mascaras I don't
know but for me it wasn't my cup of tea
when it comes to mascaras but and that
kind of surprised me because I thought I
would love it but like I said I'm gonna
give it some more tries who knows maybe
I'll grow to love it
who knows but I get to my eyelash all
the time so I feel like I'm constantly
getting and I'm talking like 12 hours
after I applied it I would eat it and it
would still be like moist you know what
I mean very very odd so um yeah so that
is that I love or iheart drugstore
makeup tag is that it's calling on them
that was a lot of fun I tagged all of
you guys to do it because this is so
much fun and I hope you guys enjoyed
watching it learn something new and if
you enjoyed please subscribe and I will
see you guys soon and find me over on my
Instagram and I will see you over all my
Twitter and even on my Facebook although
I gotta be honest I haven't really been
using that Facebook like at all I think
I've posted like a thing I don't know
I'm really all about the Instagram and
Twitter right now so find me on those
too if you want to find me on Facebook
go for it and I'm sure eventually I'll
start kind of getting on that bandwagon
as things slow down also look forward to
I'm gonna be doing some videos like

tomorrow um a travel series because I we
are heading to New Orleans here in a
couple days and so I want to kind of
show you what's in my travel makeup bag
how I packed like what's in my carry-on
what's in my like suitcase suitcase even
though I'm carrying that on as well
so just kind of how I organize that
because I I wanted this channel to also
be about organization and and I'm a very
organized person for the most part
although I'm looking right now at this
corner my
and it's like a little crazy over there
but I really am a decently organized
person so and when it comes to packing
I'm just as organized so I would love to
show you guys that I think you guys will
learn some new things that will help you
