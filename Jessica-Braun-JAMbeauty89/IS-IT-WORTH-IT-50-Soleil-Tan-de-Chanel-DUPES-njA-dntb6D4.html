second episode of my is it worth it
series and so in this series I'm
featuring expensive products ones that
are expensive in my opinion and
basically telling you is it worth the
money is it worth the price tag or is it
not so I'm giving you the pros and the
cons of all of the products in this
series so my first one was on the tachi
luminous dewy skin mists and whether or
not that is worth the 48 dollar price
tag so definitely check that out I will
link it down below if you're interested
in finding out my thoughts and so
today's focus is on the Chanel so late
and ish Annelle bronzing makeup base
they call it I've got it pulled up on
the Chanel website because I like to
read you guys the description that the
website has for it because or the brand
I should say because it's kind of
interesting to see what they think it
does and then what it actually does so
it says this light cream gel bronzer
leaves skin with a velvety finish and a
beautiful sunkissed look so this
definitely they only have one shade and
it's this kind of you know more warm
toned for-sure cream bronzer and so if
you've got much deeper skin this would
not work at all I mean as it is it's
already like I'm I would say pretty fair
so if you've got a deeper skin tone than
me I feel like it wouldn't look like a
bronzer at all um this retails for $50
now I would say it comes with a good
amount of product it's one ounce but I
mean it's spread out I use a stippling
brush with it and that's how I apply it
onto my skin and I found that's the best
way to apply it for me um so I would
agree it's a light cream gel bronzer cuz
it's not like super creamy like when you
touch it like when I swatch it I mean
it's creamy but it's not like I don't
know it feels like a cream to powder
kind of thing but it actually stays in
place throughout the day so let's keep
reading what they have to say
it says mineral waxes and powders ensure
effortless application and a mattifying
effect I would agree that this is
mattifying when you apply it there's no
shimmer at all no glimmer shimmer shine
anything it says how to apply apply it
using well of course they say their
foundation brush number six or the brush
number seven
but you can use it to sculpt and contour
the face or as a concealer for deeper
skin tones I mean this would again I
could see that but I don't I mean I
don't know that I would use this as a
concealer who's buying this giant thing
as a concealer why not buy a different
that just seems like a weird way for
them to pass on the fact that they don't
have a shade that would work for deeper
skin tones that's just not right
anyway it says wear it alone to enhance
the complexion or over foundation for a
hint of outdoor radiance so I always put
this on on top of my foundation or BB
cream if I'm wearing it I've got to be
honest you guys I have worn this like
every day since I bought it I bought it
oh my gosh why a couple months ago
though this is the brush I've been using
this is the morphe in 404 brush you can
use any brush no I'm not a morphe
affiliate they never even contacted me I
think I bought this on HauteLook for
really cheap but the elf has a really
good stippling brush as well so you just
stipple it into the product and then you
know you get enough on there so then you
can just apply it so I'll apply a little
bit up near my hairline so you guys can
kind of see it just deepens my
complexion without looking like crazy
because it's kind of this creamy powdery
it's like a cream powder product it
really is easy to blend and make look a
little bit more natural I think then
like a lot of other products would um I
just like it now these lights kind of
wash it out so it's not going to be I
don't know maybe it is obvious and then
I'll usually run it down here as well
which I did today but I like it because
it does look so natural so if your skin
tones anywhere near my it looks so
natural it stays on all day it because
it is technically cream based it doesn't
look powdery I think it's easier to
blend because of that as well and the
smell I will say though is a very strong
smell so like I would say if you know
you're sensitive to certain smells go
smell it in a department store first
because it is strong now it doesn't
bother me but I know that it's strong
enough that if you are sensitive it
might bother you so I think the
longevity of it is really good again
you've already heard my thoughts on the
color because it's
not you know you'd think with something
like this that's such a standout product
you'd think they would have like at
least a couple of other shades one
that's much deeper etc so that I think
they need to improve upon let's talk
about the packaging it's a beautiful I
mean it's Chanel so it's got this
gorgeous you know their Chanel logo as
the info on the bottom on the side of it
on one side it says so light and a
Chanel and then Chanel and then on the
other side it says that it's a bronzing
makeup base it does say that it's only
supposed to last 18 months
um which boy I hope I use every single
ounce of this up by then because I don't
want to waste any money now I really
love it I feel like I've already made a
pretty big dip in it considering how
often I use it and what I like about it
as well is like I'll get home from work
if we're going out maybe for drinks with
someone after after work I'll come home
and kind of touch up and this is the
first thing I always grabbed because I
feel like it adds life to my face so if
I didn't apply it in the morning and
even if I did I like to add a little bit
more - you know it's we're going out at
night so I like to have a little bit
more on and I just feel like it looks
natural in the daytime it looks
wonderful at night now the one main dupe
that people say is kind of a dupe for
this is the one from oh my gosh I had
bought it and I really at the time
didn't like it but now that I own this I
wish I still owned it so there are a lot
of dupes for this out there there's the
Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer I'll link
that below if you're interested in
checking that out that one's pretty good
I used to have it I got rid of it
because I didn't feel like it it stayed
on my face I felt like it wore off so it
might have looked similar but in like
two hours it was gone
the one dupe that I actually think is
really close to it is this it's in an
elf duo so you'd have to buy the duo to
own it but it's their cream blush and
bronzer but it's part of their like aqua
infused lines so it's not their normal
cream one it is actually different and
it does have more of a cream to powder
finish like the Chanel one does and it's
called bronzed pink beige and the the
blush is good not my favorites just a
little bright for me but the bronzer is
right here so it's a little bit deeper
so if you do have a different skin tone
it's a little bit deeper than the Chanel
one but it applies the exact same way if
you
stippling brush it stays on all day it
looks the same and it's a fraction of
the price which one do I reach for more
often this one partly because I spent
the money but also because it is a
little bit lighter and I think it looks
a little better on my skin but I you
they're both so good and I do think this
elf wants the best dupe that's out there
I've also heard the covergirl trublend
like creamy bronzer stuff could be a
dupe I'll have to try it out because
I've never actually tried that so I'm
very intrigued to compare them this
one's really good I don't I haven't seen
this in stores this particular one you
might have to buy it online I also have
my ELF best and worst videos if you're
interested like if you are thinking
about placing an order and you're like
well what else should i buy if I'm gonna
pay for the shipping anyway like I feel
like I should get a couple more things
I'll link that below because I've got a
lot of recommendations they have a lot
of good products they also have some
products you should avoid which I
mentioned in that video as well so
definitely check it out so my overall is
it worth fifty dollars yes because it is
that good but can you also find it for
much cheaper yes so it's kind of what
you're wanting maybe you have a gift
card to a department store and you're
really wanting to splurge then I would
say go for it cuz out of the high-end
products I've tried this one really is
absolutely wonderful so and I was
prepared to to be honest I was prepared
to be very letdown because I feel like a
lot of the things that a lot of
youtubers talk about I'm like oh my gosh
I'm so excited then I try and I'm like
so letdown that this one did not let me
down at all hopefully this video was
informative it helps you maybe make an
informed decision of some purchases
you're gonna make in the future I hope
that you will stick around and subscribe
so that you can catch more of my is it
worth it type videos also my dupe videos
that I've done etc and check me out on
my social media which is right there
other than that I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
