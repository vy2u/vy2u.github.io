going to do the next in my installment
the next installment in my series yes
and that series is mine is it what is it
series so today we're going to be
focusing on a really expensive Dior
product and it's one that is $56 which
in my opinion is crazy but I didn't pay
for this this I was sent from
Influenster
if you know what it is it's a site that
anyone can be a part of and you can get
sent things and basically they just want
you to review it good or bad
share your thoughts about it so for me
good and bad I'm going to share my
thoughts about this in classic do your
fashion it's in the beautiful vanilla
packaging and you think wow is that what
my money is going to order there's your
skin nude air Luminizer powder the
packaging oh it's so beautiful now I
will say this you open it you're like oh
my gosh it's still pretty but then when
you close it it's just the magnetic
closure you're gonna say strong that is
so satisfying to me I'm like that's
where the money is going right there so
the lower packaging is this but that is
definitely nice it definitely feels very
high-end because I feel like I've had
some expensive products that the
packaging really doesn't feel like they
put any money into it you're like come
on like seriously I just put this much
money on this can't you have nicer
packaging so packaging wire is a plus
they have four shades of this and I want
to read to you what the claims are for
this beauty here a light and airy
highlighting powder with a highly
concentrated formula and illuminating
pigments and then it says what it does
with it's virtually imperceptible
texture the your skin no dare Luminizer
reveals glowing skin for a radiantly
luminous complexion the universal shade
can be adapted to any skin tone and
comes with a mini kabuki brush applied
in gentle touches the powder highlight
areas of the face oh the powder
highlights areas of the face to catch
and reflects light wow they just defined
highlighter so the brush that it came
with this it's really small like they
said mini kabuki it's kind of rough
feeling it's definitely natural
definitely natural so what I'm going to
do I'm sorry I'm like really on
prepare for this because I've been
filming all day I put on a highlight
earlier for a tutorial but I'm going to
get rid of this highlight as much as I
can I'm going to literally put
foundation over this because I don't
want to makeup wipe it but I want it to
be a very matte start so that we can
really see what we're working with so
let's try this I'm trying to decide what
brush I'm thinking I might use where is
it is my ELF highlighting brush I love
this let me make sure there's nothing on
it at all since I've already screwed up
this science experiment so the shades
that I have I told you Darfur shades
this is in number three so it looks like
zero zero one is called nude glow and
that looks very kind of nude beige II
then there's pink glow which is number
two of course that looks very pink see
then there's golden glow which is what I
have which is very golden and then
there's bronze glow which is certainly
more of a bronzer more of a deeper for a
deeper skin tone well first let's just
watch it I haven't even swatch this bad
boy so it is a beautiful highlight now
that's not to say I haven't tried other
highlights that are this pretty but it
is definitely really pretty so let's
just get a little bit on the brush I'll
tap a little bit off oh my gosh it's
really pretty but again I don't feel
like I mean I feel like I've tried
plenty of drugstore highlights that
would do the same thing you know what I
mean and I'll pull some out in a sec oh
it's so pretty though I feel like this
is one of those highlighters that does a
good job of not showing all of your
imperfections you know sometime liners
are really kind of powdery or not as
finely milled and so when you put them
there like for me I have where is it
like a little scar on my cheek right
here I don't even know what it's from
like I'm sure it was from childhood but
I've had it forever anyway I have a
little scar and often times cheaper
highlighters will highlight that and
like okay I don't want
like illuminated for everyone to see so
I feel like nicer more finely milled
powders to a great job of hiding those
imperfections and not illuminating them
and I feel like this is doing a great
job of that I do feel like it's very
very glowy very like I picture like
summer nights like out dancin I don't
know it's so pretty it is so pretty
also there's no smell did I tell you
that there's no smell to this so is this
worth $56 let me dive into my drugstore
ones and let's see what we can find that
name thank you so I pulled out like five
that I think could possibly be dupes so
we're going to swatch them next to this
first one we're going to try is this
millennion it's their strobe light
instant glow powder in day glow and it
looks very golden looks very very
similar okay so it's certainly not as
finally no you can tell right off the
bat it's a lot more powdery but tone
wise is pretty darn similar so I would
say you could totally do this and I love
the Milani formula it's really really
pretty so I feel like you could totally
do this
and it's pretty close you can see a
little bit of a difference but pretty
close and still a really pretty
highlighter the next one I pulled out is
from Wet n Wild it's their mega clove
highlighting powder in precious petal
this one might not ah maybe not okay no
this is the wet and wild one and it's
it's too pink toned it's a really pretty
highlighter still but it's definitely
pink tone I just kind of grabbed it
quickly but it's not a do so so far no
Milani ones winning so the next one I
grabbed is from Jake at beauty it's
there you globe girl baked highlighter
in crystal sand wow this one might be
too white oh yeah what was I thinking
again still a pretty highlighter but you
can see like it kind of has this golden
look to it just in the pan so I thought
oh maybe but no that is quite white so
the next one I picked up was the
Physicians Formula natural nude now this
one's tricky because you can get all
kinds of different looks with this I
love this I'm going to go kind of in the
middle and just see see this one's too
tricky because depending on where you
pull from you get all kinds of different
shades but none of them really seem to
be anywhere close to it so I would say
no I love this highlight
though like truly one of my favorite in
drugstore but it's not right for that so
I just grabbed these elf ones they're HD
highlighting powders and these look like
they might be close so the first one
with swatches in starlight Glo now that
see I don't love the formula B Vita
these are very powdery but I think this
next one might be pretty good this one's
in sunset glow looks a little bit more
golden again these are so powdery though
for this you really are getting what you
pay for here but I always say the last
one i swatched there is closest to that
but again just even quality wise and
looking at the shimmer in that there's a
big difference so I just watched an
Oprah one for fun these can be really
pricey but I know they always have like
sales I got this in a boxy charm it's
their one in Rodeo Drive so even this
one I switched sides on you
but even this one is not quite as pretty
it's really really close but there is
some kind of quality to this highlighter
that's like none of these have so far
gotten close to so here is the ultimate
test
one of my favorite highlighters one of
the most beloved highlighters is any of
the Becca shimmering skin perfectors
this one's an opal now this is not a
shade match but I just wanted to see
shimmer wise and the way it looks is
that up to the quality of the Dior and
even still I would say no it's it's
close but there really is something in
that the or one that's making it like I
don't even know how to describe this
I've got out of something close even the
Mac ones
none of these so I mean as I'm going
through the best highlighters I own I'm
still struggling to find one that
matches this in it's like luminosity
does that make sense
this one might be dead on this is from
pure I love this highlighter it's called
afterglow and it's kind of a light
yellow no not even close okay so this
one won't be a shade match I'm sorry now
I'm just having fun this is the pixie
highlighter it's their glowy power this
won't be a shade match but I'm curious
if it will come close to like the
luminosity nope so we're near so I
burned through almost all my
highlighters just literally swatching
everything in comparison
I can't find any
thing that comes anywhere close to the
shine of this and and I genuinely as I
watched it the very first time I thought
okay I've got a million highlighters
that do this but I don't I mean you
could get it close to the shade but
there's something about this formula and
I love the way it catches the light I
feel like it does look very high-end
very I don't really know so I don't hate
hard for me to say yes this highlighting
powder is worth fifty six dollars that's
so much money in the way I look at it
like for example when I was younger in
high school I worked at Dairy Queen and
I made eight like I don't know eight
dollars now are probably a little less
than that but anyway let's pretend it's
eight dollars an hour if I started doing
the math and this is what I would do all
the time to prevent myself from spending
too much money I would do the math and
say okay how many hours do I have to
work to make it worth this and so for
that if there were eight dollars an hour
this is 56 bucks even before tax that
would be seven hours of working for the
one highlighter and I would say no or I
would say yeah it's totally worth it
like I remember when I wanted to buy The
Naked palette that's what I did and so I
realize okay six hours worth it working
would that be worth it and for that I
was like yes because I wanted it so
badly but for something like this you've
got to ask yourself that is it worth
that much money this is amazing it's not
even swatched anymore this is amazing
and I'm so glad to use it but what I
have gone out and just bought it I don't
know that is totally your dress is
called there are so many amazing
highlights that I mentioned today I will
try to link all the ones I just showed
you today down below if you're looking
for different price points different
shades I'll try to put the prices with
them as well so you can compare and make
your own decision about it I have to
admit do I think it's worth the money
yes but do I think anyone needs to just
go run out buy it no of course not you
need to make that decision for yourself
and I know sometimes it's nice to hear
that from someone else just to remind
you that you really don't need every
highlighter out there but I will say
this was very impressive I'm very
impressed with the quality of this
highlight so hopefully this video was
helpful for you guys I felt like I kind
of rambled and got off-track but I just
got so excited trying to find dupes
because I love finding deuce speaking up
if you're interested in do I have some
dupes videos on my channel I will link
some of them below if you're interested
in finding super affordable products for
really expensive
ones that are absolutely just as good
because I know this one it's almost
disappointing when you can't find
something that's as good but I found so
many in my little youtube career here so
I will link those videos below if you'd
like to see a bunch of ways you can save
some money does not check out my other
is it worth it videos where I talk about
really expensive products and if they
are worth it or not otherwise I hope
