going to share with you guys the next
video and my installment of my is it
worth it
series and today we're gonna talk about
the ridiculously priced $38 Giorgio
Armani lip magnets now these are like I
said $38 which that's a lot of money
because when you think about like a
drugstore lippy might be like $8 that's
like what is that eight times you could
almost get five for the price of one of
these now these I actually didn't
purchase they were sent to me a while
back to go from Influenster I just
really hadn't gotten around to trying
them out until recently I'm wearing one
of them on my lips today I have two
shades so I've got the shade 505 which
is what I'm wearing now and it's just a
really pretty kind of Coralie in a way
but I think it's like a mature coral
does that make sense like I think it's a
little bit deeper than a normal coral
but it's pretty the next shade that I
have is in number 400 and this is a more
kind of it's a certainly a red and when
you look at it in the actual container
it looks like an orange II red but it
goes on like a blue toned red so it's
just kind of interesting it's a really
pretty red exactly the kind of shade
that I like on myself I totally lean
towards a blue tone red over like a warm
red but I love reading the claims that
companies have for their products so I'm
gonna read you what Giorgio Armani on
their website what they say about these
lip products so it says it's an
extremely fine texture unparalleled
sensation of weightlessness intense
color concentration ultra chic matte
finish and flawless long-lasting wear
lip magnet is all this and more so
breaking that apart saying it's got a
really fine texture I will agree it does
have transfer it's not like it dries
down completely but it definitely has a
matte look to it but it is a very thin
form it like thinnest I've ever used
it's almost jelly like now let but that
doesn't sound right but
is kind of jut like it just glides right
on it's really thin and yet it's still
crazy pigmented this is thinner than
like the Ophir ones I really like says
lip magnet is the first liquid lip color
to offer unprecedented color
concentration in the finest of textures
while perfectly fusing with the lips I
will say this stuff is weird because it
does like fuse with your lips it almost
looks like a lip stain in a way but yeah
I mean that's kind of what it looks like
and it's so comfortable too it doesn't
feel all dry or anything like that it
still feels kind of comfortable it says
two major accomplishments after
application color is twice as intense
thanks to a gradual evaporation
phenomenon says the finish is four times
thinner than a liquid lip color 40 to 10
micrometers so like I said it really is
thinner it really does kind of sink into
your lips and stain them that's the best
way I can describe it and so as I've
worn these more and more I realized that
thieves really are like in a field all
their own because it's not it's just a
totally different formula and I feel
like I've tried even just lip stains and
this is more similar to those but even
still it's like in its own world says
it's long lasting up to eight hours it's
never greasy never sticky it doesn't
migrate or dry your lips the lips stay
hydrated perfectly defined for hours on
end with a very pleasant bare lip
sensation I kind of have to agree with
all this you guys and here's the thing
when I got these there's a reason I
didn't try them right off the bat
because I kind of swatched him when I
first got him and I was like hmm like
it's kind of this thin matte liquid
lipstick go figure like there's a
million out there but when I finally
pulled these out and said no I need to
give these a try and see if they're
actually any good I was like holy moly
like these just glide right on the lips
you can totally use the applicator to
line your lips so you don't necessarily
because it is pointed you can totally
line your lips with it I didn't use any
lip liner with it today or really any of
the times I've worn these I think maybe
the first time I lined my lips because
they didn't realize how how much they
just don't move they're just amazing
and I'm trying to think of any drugstore
equivalent of anything I own and I don't
own anything yet like these I don't know
that there's anything yet like these in
the drugstore if you know of something
that like as I'm describing this to you
or maybe you've tried this on your own
if you know of something that is really
similar please let us know down below
because I'm very curious I love finding
drugstore price versions because $38 for
one of these is redonkulous like that is
oh my gosh that's like $40 that's almost
half of $100 that's ridiculous
um however when there's something that
amazing it might be worth it so if this
sounds like something that you would
love or it's long lasting all day you
don't need a lip liner with it it's so
comfortable I mean it is so cool like
it's so cool I want different shades of
this they seem to have quite a few like
it looks like over 15 shades so that is
pretty awesome I mean that's like kind
of I was thinking there might be like
five shades but they've got quite a
range so it looks like they've got some
nice deep berries too like that is
calling my name and a lot of different
Reds so a lot of reds but you know what
this is a great formula for deeper
colors or like reds because it's not
gonna migrate like they said it's not
going anywhere it's just staying where
it is so all in all is it worth it yes
it totally is and I always wish I could
say no it stinks it's not worth $40 but
this totally is now I have a feeling
there's going to eventually be a
drugstore dupe if not already and when I
know about it I will let you know but
you know these this is one of those
products that eventually someone will
duplicate for way cheaper and it's gonna
be awesome but in the meantime totally
worth it totally amazing this color I'm
wearing it's 505 and I'm seeing online
the actual name of it is called second
skin and the red one and 400 the name of
it is 404 all so case you're curious
anyway hopefully this video was helpful
