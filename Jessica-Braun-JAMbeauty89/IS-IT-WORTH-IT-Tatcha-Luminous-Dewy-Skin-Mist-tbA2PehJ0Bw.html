starting a brand new series on my
channel called is it worth it and I am
so excited I was inspired by Tati who
does her WTF videos and usually they're
like crazy expensive makeup products
that she kind of puts to the test now I
don't know I can't afford to buy the
product she buys um and I they're just
usually like a couple hundred dollars
but I do have some you know pretty
expensive makeup products that I know a
lot of you guys asked me about like
you'll know you either know I own it or
you're wanting me to try it out and let
you guys know like is it worth the money
and so I thought you know everyone so
I'll do reviews on random things but I
thought why not make it into an actual
series so a I will regularly do it and
I'll pull myself accountable but be so
that you guys can see on a regular basis
you know what makeup products that are
really expensive are actually worth it
so without further ado the very first
product we're going to do is this hugely
hyped tatcha dewy skin mists now this
size retails for $48 which is a lot of
money in my opinion and you know I love
makeup I review makeup and of course I
buy makeup all the time but when I'm
spending that much money I expect it to
be like high-caliber so amazing can't
live without because that is a lot of
money so you know when I think of $50 I
think okay that's like a Naked palette
that's amazing you know things like that
so this better freaking blow my mind or
else I'm going to be kind of upset let's
get into how this works so you can use
this a couple different ways you could
use it as a setting spray so like at the
end of all your makeup you can spray it
on and the thing about it is it really
is dewy so I want to read you the claims
on the tacho website because they tout
like a lot of the really amazing
benefits of it and so when I got it in
the mail I was like oh my gosh I'm so
excited
so they write what it is it's a silky
liquid spray on moisturizer of squalene
squalane red algae and our anti-aging
how to say three complex can be misted
for a boost of soothing hydration
resulting in dewy luminous
anytime anywhere now I will completely
agree with the claims that it gives you
dewy skin definitely but there's a point
where it's too dewy and I think that's
the problem here um now it says it's
ideal for dry and combo skin so it
definitely you know if you've got oily
skin stay far far away I have got combo
skin in the summer very dry skin in the
winter and I didn't feel like it
necessarily won't actually moisturize I
felt like it just made my skin look
really really shimmery like literally
shimmery and dewy
all over and so then anywhere I had put
like anywhere I wanted to be matte like
on my under eye where I maybe put some
like finishing powder all of a sudden
was all like almost shimmery and
glittery and I'm like what so it says on
their website why it's different says
this milky emulsion contains
moisturizers and humectants that leave
skin rehydrated
can be used to refresh bare skin or
cosmetics throughout the day without
buildup or residue instantly softening
and smoothing without streaking or
disturbing makeup does not contain high
levels of alcohol and fragrance found in
conventional hydrating sprays which can
dry out the skin now I would agree and I
love that they point that out because
there's a lot of facial sprays that have
a lot of alcohol in them so those aren't
necessarily good for your skin
especially just spraying all over the
place and especially throughout the day
every single day so I really really like
that about this of course the packaging
is ridiculously beautiful as well I
think that's what suffers a lot of
people in you know it's really heavy
it's clearly glass it couldn't be
prettier and it really is like a milky
color the bottle down here is clear and
it really is like that white kind of
milky color the sprayer is fantastic it
I'm going to show you it's a very even
miss I don't know if you could see it
it's a very even miss like they said it
really doesn't have a fragrance that's
going to bother you which again I love
because fragrance is not great for your
skin especially if your skin is
sensitive so the pro is going for this
the packaging another Pro you know the
ingredients are better than what a lot
of them are those are two really big
pros huge cons the price of course with
getting better ingredients usually the
price goes up now I don't think that
that's always true I think you can get
good skin care for a much cheaper but
often times
there are better ingredients sometimes
that does make the price higher now that
being said there are a lot of insanely
expensive skin care products that are
actually not good for your skin at all
so it's not like that's a blanket
statement that's true so I put this on
my skin today underneath all of my
makeups so I had put on my moisturizer
and then before I put on a primer or
foundation or anything else I sprayed
this all over and the effect that it
gives is really a very shimmery look now
I said Glary earlier and I don't mean
that it literally looks glittery I guess
what I mean is it's just so much that
you look like just so so shimmery like I
remember the first time I used I was
like oh my gosh that is way too much so
then I would use less but it was still
too much so I think and I've heard some
other people say the same thing about it
you know they were kind of let down
because of that like you almost can't
find a good way to use it I've tried
just using it just on my cheeks so that
maybe like it would look highlight
either' and that's fine
but I didn't want to look crazy here but
it's still you know it's really hard to
control something like that I sprayed it
on my hand and it's all dry and I don't
know if you can see it almost still
looks wet because it's so DUII
um and it's just one of those things
that once it's on it's like okay now
what do I do
so then I'm having to use really
mattifying foundations that make my skin
look dry just to tone down how much of
this it is so the only way I've gotten
use out of it is that way by putting it
on underneath when I put it on on top
it's it's just too much if you like a
really really dewy look and some people
like I like a little bit of glow and I
don't really like super matte but this
was too much but if you really like a
very very dewy look you'll love this
because it really does give that to you
um you know another way you could maybe
use it although it would defeat the
purpose you could maybe spray it on your
hand and get like a brush and get a
little bit of the kind of liquid product
on there and kind of put it where you'd
want it
that might work I don't know that's kind
of a again it totally defeats the
purpose when you're spinning fifty
dollars for something like this now
based on the ingredients it does I will
say like looking around on the tachi
website I kinda want to
right other products by them because
just because I didn't like this I do
like that it's better ingredient so I'd
be interested to try their other
products but I think this is just not
right for my skin type I guess even
though I've got like dry combo skin I
don't know
so for some I'm on the Sephora website
because that's where I originally bought
this and for some reason I thought they
had a smaller size that you could buy
that I wish I had gotten um but I can't
find it now but I will say I just saw on
the Sephora website and says what else
you need to know and this is a quote
from Victoria who's the Top Chef founder
she wrote your purchase of Itachi
skincare item will send an incredible
girl to school for a day through our
beautiful faces beautiful futures
partnership now that is awesome and
that's a big deal to me because I'm also
a teacher so of course education so
important having access to education is
so important so that is really cool
doesn't mean I love the product but that
is really neat um so I don't know if you
can find where they sell a smaller
version of this and you're like maybe
I'll like it cuz maybe I would want that
that much of a do we look it might be
worth checking out but I can't find it
so hopefully this video was informative
I've been like waving this sucker around
this whole video like a magic wand
hopefully it didn't seem to UM you know
like bad like I don't want to seem like
I was bashing on this product cuz there
are good things about it and I think
obviously this brand has a lot going for
it as well but I really I wouldn't
recommend it I can't put my GMT 289
stamp of approval on it hopefully you'll
subscribe before you leave to catch more
of my videos and some future is it worth
it videos I think I'm gonna film another
one right now as well on another really
expensive really popular Chanel product
to see if it's worth it other than that
I hope that you'll catch me on my social
media which is right there on the screen
you can see some behind the scenes
action when I'm filming I like to do
some behind the scenes I also show you
what makeup I'm trying out in the
morning says I'm getting ready for work
and other than that I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
