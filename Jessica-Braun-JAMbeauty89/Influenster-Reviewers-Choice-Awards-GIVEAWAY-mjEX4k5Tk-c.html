gonna be sharing with you guys about one
of my favorite websites ever Influenster
and they recently contacted me to do a
sponsored video and I was like yes
because that like if you've been
watching my channel for a while
you've heard me talk about it so many
times because it's a website there's two
main reasons I love the website so first
of all I discovered it because they do
like makeup reviews and things anyone on
there can review makeup products and you
know you rank them and you can see them
by category what's the number one so if
you're looking for BB creams you can
have you can see what people across the
nation but voted number one number two
number three so you can make a really
educated guess when it comes to
purchasing maybe a new BB cream and I
love that I also love that periodically
like if you're active on the side and
you're reviewing things from time to
time etc and if you blinked some of your
social media accounts you can be
eligible to get free boxes of products
just for free and they call them Vox
boxes and sometimes it's a certain
brands Vox box or it'll be a theme
whatever it is it's amazing they even
have like wedding Vox boxes or you know
YSL Vox boxes they also now have an app
which I was excited about because I've
been playing with it for a while now I
want to show you how it works because I
did it the other day in the store and I
was like oh this changes the way I shop
because now if I see a product I'm
thinking about I can okay so here's a
barcode and I'm just going to scan the
barcode on there I don't know if you can
see it let me like get it so it scans
there we go so it's scanning it pulls up
the product you scan and as you go
through it actually you can see it's
gotten four out of five stars and while
there I actually posted a review about
that foundation and a picture but a
bunch of other people have reviewed it
and people will say okay I have dry skin
and it works this way with my skin and I
have oily skin and it works this way so
again you can make a really educated
purchase and you don't want to you know
none of us want to waste our money so
it's way better if you can just quickly
scan it and see
what people are saying about it without
just buying it and then realizing oh man
this is terrible for my kind of skin or
oh it's just a bad product in general so
obviously I love the app I will link
build the website in the app down below
I know it's available in both the App
Store but also for Android so I'll link
that I'm also excited because they just
released their reviewers Choice Awards
what I really liked about the reviewers
Choice Awards idea is that the people
that were voting for what products were
the winners are just normal people like
you and me that just loved makeup so
there was no you know wasn't beauty
editors deciding it was just normal
people and I think that is perfect
hundreds of thousands of votes were
placed for the best in four different
categories it was makeup hair skin and
then also pamper which I love that
category too but I want to talk about
the makeup category so they've sent me
some of the winners the list is really
long if you want to see the full list
again I'll link that below as well
because as I went through it I was like
oh my gosh all of these are amazing so I
want to share some of my favorites of
the winners and I will put links for all
the products I mentioned down below and
there might be a giveaway involved so
stay tuned to the end hmm okay so the
first one yo s sweet mint lip balm cos
lip balms in general are wonderful but
the sweet mint really is my favorite
it's minty its moisturizing and it is so
cute another favorite I've been talking
about for like over a year now is the
Real Techniques expert face brush I have
one that I've had for a long time in a
new one these are amazing they hold up
through a million washes they are the
softest things in the world they're
really well made and they apply
foundation beautifully and if as if I
need to add any more about this it's a
drugstore price so it's not breaking the
bank it's better than most high-end
foundation brushes I've tried another
winner was the Revlon lip butters and I
I used to own like every color of this
I've used a lot of them this one's in
the shade strawberry shortcake it's just
a really pretty pink these I think the
main reason they're winners is because
they've got a nice shade range but
they're also just really comfortable to
wear for every day another winner I'm
wearing on the face today and actually I
apply it with the expert face brush so
if you notice it was dirty that's why
it's the cover
outlast stay fabulous this one is the
packaging is great it's got a pump it's
glass but not only that it's just a
really high coverage foundation and if
you have oily skin you're really gonna
love this because it mattifies your face
as well another foundation from the
drugstore was a winner and it is the
Maybelline fit me foundation this one is
really nice I think if you just have
combo skin I mean it's kind of one that
works for any skin type but not only
that it just gives a nice medium
coverage it looks a lot more natural
every time I've ever worn the fit me
foundation I just feel like I'm not
wearing foundation and I really like
that about that again especially for
everyday like going to work another
winner was a mascara from covergirl and
this is their lash blast volume tons of
people on YouTube rave about this it's
got a synthetic brush it's really great
for defining your lashes and adding
volume and so I mean with mascara those
are kind of the two main things so I
think it really is a nice mascara option
from the drugstore there were a couple
of high-end winners that I received as
well this one's the benefit they're real
mascara and this one I'm wearing today
as well it holds a curl pretty well it
actually for something that really does
add volume again it also defines your
lashes so I was able to do my lower lash
line without getting it crazy clumpy or
anything like that so I was very
impressed and then the last winner I'm
going to talk about is the NARS duo and
it's the blush and bronzer duo and
orgasm and Laguna and Laguna is a
bronzer I actually have the full size of
this it's just a really comfortable
beautiful shade of a bronzer and then
the blush is just so pink and peach at
the same time but it's got like a gold
tint to it they're just such beautiful
colors I'm wearing both of these today I
think they're they can be really natural
or amped up it just depends on how much
you apply and I think that's so great
and so versatile so if you're wanting to
win all of the products I just showed
you including that NARS duo which is
like crazy expensive sign up for
influencer down below with the link I
provided so not only will you have a
chance to win all of the products that I
just showed you but they're also picking
