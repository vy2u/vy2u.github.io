gonna share with you guys my Ipsy and
boxycharm unboxing so let's go ahead and
get into it so let's start with it see
this is $10 a month I've always got
links for them below if you're curious
the bag this month is actually really
cute it's kind of got like a swirly
design but they almost look like they
could be roses in a way I like the color
and it's like kind of feels like it's a
little more well-made the first thing in
here is this oh I do want to try this
this is the NYX liquid suede cream
lipstick in the shade
it in heels there's the shave name I was
to be honest I don't want to try to
dress kind of hoping it would be like a
nude color you know as if I have as if I
don't have enough nudes let me get that
in there again it looks like it's
definitely like that really thin
consistency ooh that is pretty though
sorry I literally have writing on my
hand from things I need to remember from
school um super classy that is really
really pretty
I love this color red it's totally like
up my alley I know it's not up
everyone's alley but I love that it's a
really thin consistency but it looks
like it's like actually semi
moisturizing in a way and just crazy
pigmented for that thin of a layer which
is nice because when you got a really
thick layer on and then it gets messed
up it's I don't know it just bothers me
so that I'm excited to try this out
the next thing in here is this bean
gushie bow if she I don't I literally
never it's all it's really small
from Paris it's a little brush it's
their eyeshadow brush then it's just
like a flat one like a flat kind of
shader brush in a way it feels really
really soft although a couple of the
hairs are like falling out as I just do
this so that's kind of not the best time
it shouldn't be happening
I'll definitely wash it obviously before
I use it we'll see if like a bunch more
hair falls out because that
would not be great because I have had an
eyeshadow brush hair that got in my eye
once and it took me like all day to get
out it hurt like I was terrified it
would like mess up my eye so I'm leery
about that with eye brushes next thing
this is the scone we've received
something from scone before insanely
intense tattooed waterproof eyeliner in
jet black goo I'm already intrigued I'm
always looking for other versions of my
beloved Stila stay all day waterproof
eyeliner and so I'm always game to try
one that could also be as black and as
easy to apply and as budge proof so I
would love this work all right so it's
got the same kind of a tip as that where
it's just like a felt oh yeah so you can
get a really thin line a really thick
line this is super black oh my gosh I
love I am so excited to try it and see
if it like stays I'll have to try it
tomorrow that would be awesome alright
next thing in here is this Marc Anthony
nourishing argan oil of Morocco
three-day smooth perfect flow Drive
smoothing cream says it holds hair
straight for history and shiny for up to
three days for all hair types and fused
with keratin huh apply evenly through
damp hair from roots to ends so you put
it everywhere blow dry to create a frizz
free smooth finish my only thing with
this is my hair's already kind of thin
so when I put something like this on it
I feel like it just yes like you would
make it straight but I feel like it just
ends up looking like really greasy
really quickly so these will always work
great for me I might try it I might pass
this on to my sister because her hair is
a lot thicker than mine so I feel like
it would just do better in there by my
still try it out and the last thing in
the bag is nude sticks lip and cheek
pencil cheek so it's a thinner pencil
and it's short it looks like a pretty
color kind of like a muted kind of like
a lighter wine color almost dusty rose
but it's a kind of a thicker one when
you put it over your oh it's like shiny
it's like almost glossy
they reminds me of the formula of the
Revlon balm stains in a way I don't know
if this stains but yeah it doesn't call
it's not called a stain it doesn't have
a smell this is a really pretty color
like really pretty I might put it on I
just wiped my lip gloss off let's I want
to try it okay I really like this color
I like that you can kind of line your
lips with it in a way you don't really
need to but you know you can kind of
draw the line and then fill everything
else in but see my lips are so pigmented
as it is that you know if you have less
fingers it lifts this to show up
probably a little bit better I like it
right I like that it's kind of in
between deep and not like you know what
I mean it's like a medium I like it so
that's pretty awesome
not bad an empty bag I'm excited about
the liquid suede and I'm really excited
about the liquid liner and this lip
pencil so the other two I'll try out
I'll let you know but those other three
I mean that was pretty solid that might
be one of the best HC bags we've ever
gotten so boxycharm is a little bit more
expensive I think it's twenty one a
month but the theme is sweet treats
sugar is sweet but this box is sweeter
okay oh I just saw something that I'm
really excited about I'm gonna make you
wait so first thing is this Luxy 512
small contouring brush these are really
soft I had another one of these probably
from a past boxycharm and I don't
remember what brush it was but it was
really really nice I'm sure I still have
it my collection because they're really
soft like teddy bear soft and I think
the light pink and like the bronze is
really pretty this really is a perfect
size that can for like a little contour
and actually the brush I'm using right
now for contouring is about this size so
this I will definitely use definitely
next thing is this Chella tantalizing
taupe eyebrow color
I've had some cella iProducts eyebrow
products before and they were really
nice I don't know that I've tried
specific product yet though and they can
be kind of pricey so this is pretty cool
this is definitely a full-size and I
don't know what they sent everyone the
taupe or what you know if it's like one
of those supposedly Universal colors
that are never truly Universal it looks
like it actually probably be good for me
it's right there so you know with a
little bit lighter of a hand you can
make it now it doesn't really get any
lighter it's pretty much the same color
no matter how you do it but it looks
like it would actually match so it's
just there's no slowly on the other end
it's just a simple really like micro
eyebrow pencil so I will definitely use
that assuming it matches correctly all
right fine I'll show you the things I
was really excited about I won't make
you wait till the end there are two
makeup geek press eyeshadows in here I
love makeup geek shadows I only have
like four or five maybe and they're
incredible actually I'm wearing makeup
geek shimma shimma on my eyelids today
it's the best shimmery eyeshadow I've
ever used compared to like in me thing
okay so this first one is in
Cosmopolitan and it looks like it's kind
of like a burnt bronzy orange cut oh my
gosh it looks like eye shadow form of
rubenesque wow that is so pretty I don't
know if I would wear it everyday like
it's for me that's not like an everyday
color but it's so pretty I would
definitely use it and these are always
so ridiculously pigmented it's
ridiculous said that 20 times do you
guys feel like this is getting darker as
we as like time is going on the lip
color not mad about it
this next one who is in Coco bear party
onus I might I might not this is a
really popular shade of theirs I was
just so cool that this is in here it's a
matte whereas the other one was shimmer
it's a matte warm brown so if you've
been looking for a really good warm
brown this is like awesome absolutely
awesome and these blend really well
together too so moving on the next thing
is Catherine Malandrino style dapeng
a perfume I assume
yeah let's try shall we oh it's a little
bit bigger than I expected which is good
nervous I'm gonna spray lake something
Oh pleasantly surprised it smells really
sweet but not like not like viva la
juicy really sweet kind of like a muted
sweet like one you really would wear
every day I'm just gonna do it but it
also does like a hint of like some sort
of like floral I feel like I don't know
it's kind of nice and it's a it'd be
perfect for travel because it's plastic
but it's like secure you know what I
mean so the last thing in here is this
Clark's botanicals anti puff eye cream
this is clearly a full-size this is the
cool it's like a green almost
see-through it makes me think of like
old apothecary things the end type of
eye cream specifically target stubborn
puffiness dark circles fine lines
concentration of botanicals vitamins I'm
an A and E I so flavin vitamin K yeah
morning and night you can put it on
sweet L can also be applied a fly can be
applied on smile lines and forehead
frown lines so those called frown lines
up there I don't do that when I found
maybe I do like I am never frowning like
that anyway so this is a big now it's
like making it sound like it's liquid
but it's not I don't think I don't know
so I like the jar as well so that's
pretty awesome this was a this was a
good month all around for both of those
I feel like I am so excited about those
eyeshadows and the brow pencil and the
brush so sweet so only enjoyed this
