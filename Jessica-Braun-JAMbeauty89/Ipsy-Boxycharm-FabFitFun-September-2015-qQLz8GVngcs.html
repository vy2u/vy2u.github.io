going to unbox three different
subscription boxes here on my channel
I'm going to be unboxing the Ipsy the
boxycharm and to think way too hard
about that and a fabfitfun box I've
unboxed all of these on my channel
before so let's go ahead and get into it
so let's start with if see this one is
$10 a month and I'm just excited okay so
let's see what the battery looks like
that's always the true test it's like a
gold dish Brown I don't love it I don't
I just don't love it but the reality is
a lot of these items giving away to
sisters because when you have it each
month you don't need that many makeup
bag so I use some of my purse some when
I travel and pack and stuff but you
can't use all of them so this might be
one I pass on if someone wants it but
let's go ahead and see what's actually
in here so the first thing I just pulled
out looks like a pixie product I can
tell by the green this is the pixi by
petra shades of brown so it's a little
it says they're mini brow trio
so it's this adorable little and it
looks like it's got two different brow
shape and then like a brow bone
highlight shade I mean that's how I
would use them but yeah it's not crazy
pigmented but it just might do the trick
the Browns not really pigmented either
but again you're wanting to kind of I
don't know I have to try it my brows
with a brush because I think that's
gonna be very different and for me I
don't want anything that's just straight
black or you know I want it to be
workable so I can add more if I need but
I don't want to have to worry about
using a lighter hand so I'm gonna have
to try this and let you know is it
certainly doesn't swatch well but you
don't necessarily want that in a brow
product so interesting the excited to
try that something different that's for
sure ooh the next thing is by city color
and this is
city chic lipstick and it's in the shade
one-night-stand it looks like a really
pretty berry shade which is right up my
alley of course I'm not wearing berry
today but I love berry lipsticks oh so
much especially as we get into fall and
I'm sure they have that in mind as well
okay so it looks like a pinkish purple
but let's see Oh
so it's really really pigmented but
really really moisturizing if you will
so it's certainly not a matte at all
it's more of like a creamy satin almost
look more like a luster it's got a
little but it's really really really
pigmented there's no smell at all I
can't smell anything and it's got all a
little city caller emblem on the very
tippy top that's so cute I didn't notice
that before I started to swatch it away
but that's a really pretty shade so I
will definitely wear that the next thing
ooh is a glam glow flash my brightening
treatment now I've had a few of these
and this so this one's a mask so you put
it on your dry face leave it on for 20
minutes and wash it off the water me and
the husband over there well have we've
done a few masks together so I'm
actually really excited to try this one
with them maybe we'll do it this week
you'll love it so that's pretty cool and
these this is not a full-size that the
full size flammable products are crazy
expensive now I will say I've looked
glam glow up on the Beauty pedia section
of the Polish Choice website where you
can wear dermatologists and people great
products in regards to their ingredients
whether they're actually good for your
skin or not or whether they're actually
doing anything for your skin or not and
glam glow doesn't always get the best
reviews so I might look it up before we
try it that's just something to keep in
mind okay so this is it says not soap
radio I might have read that in the
wrong order but it's there liquid froid
when you need to turn up the volume on
your inner voice of reason very funny so
this is hand in body lotion in the
is coconut milk mango and vanilla this
would be a good thing to travel with I
can smell the coconut milk just sounds
nice delicate it's not a really
overpowering scent so that's nice innit
whoa hold on a little bit I got it felt
really moisturizing on a try a little
more I don't love that you have to like
pound it out of there
me oh that does smell really really nice
coconut milk mango in vanilla I can
smell all three of those in there but it
feels really really moisturizing so
that's pretty cool
hope you good wouldn't have in your
purse as the weather is getting colder
too
the last thing in here is this temp tube
product which that's an airbrushing
system which I don't have and I don't
really have the desire of half just
seems like a lot of work unless you like
a makeup artist so you're gonna be doing
that I know that I'm not going to pull
an airbrush system out and do my makeup
I just and I say that now who knows
maybe I'll change my mind eventually but
where I am right now no way so here's
the downside you can't really
oh my thinks you can use it without it
okay I was gonna say if you can't use
this without the airbrushing thing but
you can just dab it on it's like a link
when highlight really is all it is so
let's see more of like a ooh that's
pretty
it's called their champagne shimmer that
is actually really really pretty so
maybe I won't use that I spoke too soon
hmm
and it was out to actually work with
light skin because it was looking a
little dark for light skin but so but if
you have a deeper skin tone than I do
it'd probably be even more beautiful so
that was everything that was in the bag
this a month the next thing we'll open
is the boxycharm and okay so it's these
ten boxycharm is twenty one a month so
it is more expensive but they typically
have full-sized products whereas I think
all of these except for the city color
were like trial size the pixie I'm
assuming is trial size seeing as it's a
mini brow trio anyway so let's go ahead
and get into it start off a little birth
these are the scratch nail wraps now I
don't have long nails naturally as you
can tell so for me these really don't
look
right on me unless I have like fake
nails but again I don't do that often
either they just really don't work so
I'm gonna pass these on to a sister that
has longer nails that could actually use
them it's a cute pattern and scratches
are really nice brand I've had I've
gotten there they have like a
subscription box as well and I've gotten
that in the past and actually they
really are nice ones but I know myself I
knew I won't use them okay the next
thing haha this is the cella eyebrow
defining gel I actually have one of
these and I do not know where I got it
but I've been using it actually every
day for the past month as my eyebrow gel
it's just a clear gel to kind of tame
your brows to keep them where you want
them facing the direction you want them
to face I don't think this has a very
strong hold so I'm kind of just using it
up it's almost gone
I might belong to this as kind of a
backup because I have my honest Asya one
and a NYX one that I'm using I don't
know I'm gonna keep it though because
it's not bad and so I used it today it
does hold them in place but not as well
as the Knicks the Knicks one does in the
Anasazi windows so we'll see I don't
know it's so nice though if you got it
you probably use it it's a pretty good
eyebrow gel what I liked about it is
it's not crazy wet so it doesn't leave
like a really wet look on your brows or
like crunchy look so I do like that part
huh this is a tart product this is a
full-sized hard product this is in the
shade gold it's their smolder eyes
Amazonian clay waterproof liner ooh I
would actually use gold it's a deeper
gold than I would have expected but look
how shimmery it is oh my gosh
and the Tarte products they're so known
to be very long wearing I wonder how
this all so it blends a little bit but
not a ton so it really does once it's
there it's kind of set in plate around
the legs I'm sure because look it
blended pretty well this is awesome it's
got a little smudger on the side so if
you wanted to do like a little gold on
the like out on the lower lash line
that'd be cool too
that is beautiful I probably will use
that especially even if you just like
colored
lid and blending it that'd be a
beautiful lid shape okay next thing in
here is this Kardashian beauty black
seed dry oil I just read this BuzzFeed
article about a girl that like tried all
the Kardashian and Jenner promoted
products for a week or something it was
kind of funny to read this is one of the
products she tried so I'm assuming it's
a supply of small amount and Singh hands
and distribute evenly on dry or damp
hair and style as usual so I would try
this and if I liked it this would be
nice oh it's closed
this would be nice to travel with for
something like that so cool the next
thing is this facade see brush and it's
like a foundation brush I don't really
use this kind the brushes they've sent
from Basanti are good brushes I can tell
this is well-made but I just don't maybe
I'll try it at this time I just don't
use them I use one that's really small
that's like this for like my under my
brow bone but it's like an eye shadow
brush that's the synthetic and it's the
same shape but for actual foundation use
didn't even you guys use the what do you
use them for I've heard of people using
these to apply to masks which maybe I'll
use that with like the glam glow one
that'd be cool
and the last thing in here well this is
big it's provis
skin type one one through six what is it
it's hydro milk to squeeze the small and
in the palm of your hand multiplying by
gently rubbing your palms together to
warm it for an even all-over application
do it in a circular motion but what is
it supposed to do it's supposed to
improve skin hydration of bite free
radicals so is it like a moisturizer
yeah yeah so I think it must be a
moisturizer I like the packaging I like
that kind of goes down to the little tip
cute but it's in if the full size too
much is awesome by the way if you're
curious about the makeup I'm wearing I'm
wearing almost all elf products I just
filmed a best
elf products video and if it's already
up I'll link it below I'm not sure which
order I'm uploading these but I love elf
you can do a hoe my gosh it's just so
amazing anyway that was just totally off
topic that's it fun let's do this this
one is crazy expensive this one's $50
and it's not a monthly box it's a
seasonal box so like this is their fall
or autumn box they say it's always like
a $200 retail value we're gonna see
because I've gotten this before and it
was pretty cool but I wasn't totally
sold on it cuz it is so expensive so
let's see what's in this this season so
it comes with like a little note about a
magazine but it's got everything that's
in you I don't want to cheat I don't
want to look at it yet let's see oh this
is cute it says hold on it says all you
need is love and pumpkin spice lattes it
says that right there that's cute
alright let's just start on the top
first thing it says gold radiance luxury
facial mask with collagen and rosa
damascena flower oil I am no way I said
that right brightens restores and
rejuvenates for glowing skin and it's
got two facial masks in it I want to see
that this is like oh wow so it's got the
masks and they're kind of like golden
you can see the creepy eye holes I die
when people post pictures on Instagram
of them in a mouth it tickles me to
death I love it it makes me think of
like Michael from Halloween the movie if
you've seen it so freaky but it makes me
laugh so I would love if you've got a
mask on take a picture and tag me it on
Instagram I love it it cracks me up or
on Twitter alright the next thing it
says purple purse Allstate Foundation so
it says share a photo of this charm on
your bag show survivors they're not
alone it says it shows your support for
a world without domestic violence so
that's pretty that's pretty cool next
thing is this it says tribal I hope is
our message fashion is our medium this
is so cute look how adorable this
bracelet is that is adorable that I will
wear I love how simple it is if your
haven't picked up by wear for the most
part pretty simple jewelry everyone
smile wear like it save a piece but I'm
pretty boring when it comes to do
just like simple stuff this one is a dr.
Dee Schwab flawless skin fluid so is it
the moisturizer okay I was gonna say I
need that because there's like serum so
moisturizers and cleansers and cleansing
oils and I'm like which step is it but
this one is a moisturizer and it says
that it also evens out your skin tone
and restores clarity for a youthful
looking flawless glow in any light you
will see but I will try that because I'm
always I'll probably look it up on the
Beauty pedia on Paula's Choice as I will
with the hydro milk from or earlier as
well all right moving on mana okay
there's this mana the brand is mana and
it's this lash primer and I thought I
wouldn't like it I love it so I'm I
think I'd open it in my last month
subscription box it's amazing I was
totally like dogging on in the video and
it is amazing so I'll have to talk about
that more maybe I'll do a review demo of
it so this is let's the sea so what I'm
trying to say is that mana is a brand
that I've never heard of and now I'm
like wanting to know more because that
was so amazing okay it says lip-locked
lucky priming blasting whoo so it's like
a gloss I love it it's kind of like a
peachy nude
it's a doe foot applicator oh it's got
it's got some color to it I mean it's of
course this watch does it absolutely no
no it's got a lot of color you guys are
like where is it umm feels kind of
sticky I'll be honest but I don't mind
sticky gloss but I know a lot of people
are kind of like about it it's more
opaque then a lot of glosses I own which
I don't mind because I really like this
shade so I'm excited it feels the
packaging even feels nice so I win all
the use of this and I use decluttered so
much of my makeup I literally have like
nine lip glosses left and I used to have
like 60 or 70 if you haven't seen my
declutter I will link it below it
changed my life I read a book the
life-changing magic of tidying up tons
of people are reading it for a good
reason it's amazing but I got rid of
most of my makeup but that means the
things that I kept are things that I
love so anyways alright the next thing
is the number ah this fabfitfun
tapping
elective and it says rain rain go away
all over that's cute that is cute we're
going to London in the winter and maybe
I will bring this one because it's about
the same spell I guess that's about the
same size as the one I already have but
this is cute
very very cool fix thing it says
strength tubing ankle small cuffs so I
think it's one of those since this table
fit fun I always have some sort of like
fitness thing see hence the fit part hot
dogs my friend Sarah she is literally
her job is like fitness she's like a
fitness guru she would know she would be
able to tell me how to use this but
feels really well made I think you do
your ankles and you like move the legs
out and things like that but I can look
up some videos and stuff but this is
awesome
just in time use in the winter you don't
want to get outside and run and winter
coming winter is coming anyway ok next
thing in here oh this is a hissy or hi-c
portable power bank so it's like one of
those things you can stick in your purse
or your luggage and power yeah stuff
with USB says it'll give over one full
charge for most smartphones that's
pretty cool it's like oh it's pink I
could tell them trying to pink it is
pink that is awesome and I will
definitely use this I have one but I
lost like the way to charge it like two
actual charged to actually charge the
thing so I'm just gonna have to I might
get rid of that one and just keep this
one that's awesome oh you're kidding
comes with a video for how to use those
tube things your ankles perfect pay read
everyone's mind that everyone that
opened it probably like I don't know how
to use it
alright and then the last things in here
are just like coupons
type things like for some crest 3d white
this one $15 Oh $15 off of this reads
comic slash jewelers wife and it says
some of the brand's sold there are Alex
and Andy Kendra Scott Michael Kors
dog-eared Pandora etc so I will use that
so that was everything in there it's a
lot of stuff but the only you have to
think about when
you heard about to spend $50 is is it
$50 worth of stuff that I would have
bought on my own or that I'm really
gonna use because you know it's nice to
have you know these face masks in this
bracelet and the power bank and whatever
else but if you know you're not going to
use it or you're just gonna you're like
oh great cool but it's not really that
meaningful to you then it might not be
worth it might be worth spending that
$50 on just one or two things that you
know you need and want so that's great
and that's kind of the way it is with
any subscription box but keeping that in
mind if you know that you have the money
and you want to surprise yourself every
few months then it's really fun but that
is you know I'm always financially
conscious so that is one thing to think
about hopefully this video was enjoyable
to you I can link my entire subscription
box playlist I have been opening
subscription boxes the forum is cool
I've been doing it for like ever years
so I will link the playlist below if
you're interested other than that I hope
you'll subscribe and I'll catch you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
