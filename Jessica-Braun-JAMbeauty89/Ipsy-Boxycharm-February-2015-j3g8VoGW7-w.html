the Ipsy versus boxy charm and some
people are like that is not fair boxy
tremors more expensive I'm like I know I
don't mean it like a true vs so I'm
changing the name to ypsi and boxy charm
and it's just going to be an unboxing of
them because people are crazy no I'm
just kidding but they're right they're
not it's not a fair comparison because
if c is ten dollars and boxy charm is
$21 so this is just going to be me
showing them to you not truly comparing
them even though usually they're both
really good and usually I like boxer
more because well it's more high-end
products more full size because it's
more expensive so regardless i'm really
excited to show these to you guys i have
it ok i peeked a little bit i peeked a
little bit but i'm excited regardless ok
so this is what the Ipsy bag looks like
this month and its really it's one I
always talk about how some are really
well made and some are not it's like
they switch off each month to save money
I don't know I'm probably making that up
regardless this is what it looks like
and it's actually a little bit nicer
made this time I think it's cute it
makes me think of spring and of course I
think the theme is like love because
it's februari yeah it is so so that's
what it looks like and let's dive on in
so the first thing in here is this brush
that barely fit in this is the Luxy 50
for large angled brush and it's really
cute because it's got like this kind of
bronze color thing and then pink the
thing feral and then a pink handle and i
will say it feels really soft and this
would be great for throwing some blush
on even throwing on highlight um I'm i
will probably use this a lot and i love
that bronze farrell cuz i love rose gold
but i think i've been leaning more
towards bronze lately and i think that's
really really pretty it's like a mix
anyway so that's pretty cool um ok the
next thing this is a city color creamy
lip stain flirtini is the shade cute um
if you're wondering what i'm wearing on
my face today i know a lot of people ask
um today I actually
also filmed a Mary Kay review of my
favorite products from Mary Kay and I'm
wearing a mare ke blush and shy and then
on my eyes and wearing a bunch of their
shadow so if that video is up I'll link
it if not just stay tuned subscribe
it'll be up soon but then on my lips is
actually rimmel airy-fairy which I
talked about my winter favorites video
and it's like just a really pretty oh my
gosh oh my gosh i love it and it's like
five bucks it's so amazing anyway ok so
I've got it open so this is so flirty
knee is the color and it says it's a
stain whoa it smells like paint oh I
cannot handle this on my lips let's see
what it looks like whoa that might be
the prettiest rose color I've ever seen
why does it smell so bad it smells like
now it doesn't smell as bad what you
need Tyler boo um it's so pretty ok
alright so it's a really really pretty
rosy color but it smells terrible but
now it's not smelling it but I feel like
I've got a hit ok I got to figure this
out it smells like like varnish you're
some sort of spray paint or something it
it's not as strong as when I first
whipped it but it's noticeable so if you
got this smell it and see if your smells
the same and let me know um it's so
pretty go I'm probably nowhere in any
way are you kidding me I want to see
what this looks like it says it
sustained so I should probably wipe it
off my hand soon it's such a pretty
color oh my gosh alright the next thing
in here is this airs body butter huh
it's one ounce of this body butter this
is Patagonia I don't know if that's the
scent or okay it's close to dig right in
huh
it has like a well it's not a nice smell
it's just different it smells clean but
like with like a little bit of musk or
something it's a really really really
thick cream that's nice though I see you
know I need something like this like on
my teacher desk because I've got some
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works hand creams but I need
something thicker right now because it's
a straight-up blizzard right now and I
am everything is dry okay so that's
pretty nice next thing boo a blush this
is oops got the lotion on my face I
really did alright this is a blush from
Monaco so the color is in peach Bellini
I love peachy shades it looks really
really pretty kind of looks like the
blush i have on now let's see what it
looks likes washed that is so beautiful
oh my gosh that's gonna be so pretty
this spring well that was a good one so
that's pretty awesome this is a good
good one um ok next one is hey honey
take it off exfoliating honey peel-off
mask it's a true it's like a sticky
clear gel I've never really used peel
off things like this well maybe I have a
long time ago I feel like I remember
doing that and it I don't know I didn't
like freaked me out so maybe I'll try it
again we'll see and then the last thing
in here I'm sorry do you think that was
one two three four or five this is sick
so I'm sorry do you think one of these
must have been one of the things i got
like with ypsi points so this is the
mitchell and peach fine radiance face
oil florida number one is the scent a
light oil with natural antioxidants and
vitamins avoid the eyes massage two to
three drops into skin alone or under
moisturizer it just smells kind of
really smell it it doesn't really have a
smell smell at least I'm not smelling it
but it's just an oil so that's nice I
might give that a try I might look it up
and see if this is on polished choice
beauty pedia and see if it's like any
good I don't know but it smells nice so
I'm so those are all the things even
though I'm pretty sure one of those was
in my actual bag it must have been a
Dipsy points because it's usually only
five things either way they were all
really awesome so for ten bucks that's a
lot of goodies they're getting better
and better now onto boxy charm which is
$21 like I said and this usually has
four to five full-size products so this
one actually has the products broken
down with how much they cost kisses from
boxy charm forget that box of chocolates
and fall in love all over again with
your boxy charm this month let us be
your Valentine indulge you with sweet
treats that will melt your heart Wow
made with love and sealed with a kiss we
truly hope you enjoy your boxee gift all
right that's so cute look I'm cubed is
inside they are we getting excited okay
so I'm gonna grab first thing this is
the Jing I your love something your love
would it says pink star on the side like
the shape oh it's a says Velvet shine
lip jewel Oh again it's another really
pretty rosy pink color and it's just one
of those twists up crayons doesn't
really have a smell that really is a
nice color though again perfect for
spring so that is pretty cool and that
one retails for $22 I mean it feels
creamy but $22 she's illusion just gonna
rebel on 148 sheesh ok the next thing is
this onl pas oh i wish i would have had
this before valentine's day i probably
did that I wanted to wait for the Ipsy
anyway it's the ncl a nail polish in
heart attack and it's got all these
really cute little hearts and things in
it oh my gosh pink and red that's
adorable and this one retails for
sixteen dollars for the full size who is
paying that much I'm gonna open it so I
can see like see these are always so
tricky to me because I can't get that I
wonder if you i'm sure you guys feel the
same way i can never get the hearts
where I want them you know what I mean
like I feel like I put it and it's like
I get ten hearts in one corner like a
heart elsewhere i'm like why can't I get
this spread evenly so that's why I
always like straight away from these but
I'll give this a try
that's really cute and actually our
anniversary tethers my anniversary is in
March so it's coming up soon maybe I'll
say for that or maybe I'll just wear for
the heck okay um next thing there's like
gunk on it this is the Mistura
complexion corrector this is looking
like dirty look how dirty that looks
this is weird and that's boom well that
would be why oh my gosh the whole thing
just fell out no wonder it just fell out
and look at that so it's a mess it was
no good and shipping I guess but I'll
see okay so for me this is like I think
a concealer um its way to dart you can
already see it's way too dark for my
skin tone it work for medium light to
medium but I'm like fares can be so boo
I'm I'm probably just gonna toss it it's
broken I I don't really care because I
don't I wouldn't be able to use it I do
it but that sucks and they usually
package it pretty well but even like the
sticker i'm thinking it's just this
brand even the stickers like coming off
there and just looks kind of crummy
packaging so i would that something like
I wouldn't blame that on boxee term I
would just say it's the brand I don't
know just saying okay the next one not
one retails by the way for 3699 no no
what ok the next thing in here is a
brush a lot of brushes this year and
let's see this is fifteen dollars first
of all I brush um it's really really
soft and it's definitely synthetic and
it's modern minerals and since you are
gorgeous but it's their duo fiber mini
round brush for shading smokey eyes
highlighting blah blah um it is really
nice and small which I do like and I
will use you know for the outer corner
really anywhere um I just have so many
like this already an elf sells really
really good ones for inexpensive but
it's nice I would rather have had
something other than a brush but most
people probably would like having
brushes but like this brush is way
better and it was in the ten-dollar epsy
so again
okay next thing is the facial mask this
is mullet Mullane and sparrow or Mullen
and sparrow and this one retails for
fifteen dollars and this is it
apparently at deluxe size Oh what this
is cool it's powder and it's got a cute
little stopper at the top and what they
say is makes a small amount with water
to form a smooth paste apply to moisten
face neck and chest avoiding eyes allow
it to dry gently remove with warm water
followed by cool water rinse used at
least once a week for a deeply clean
radiant skin most effective when applied
following okay well um I am so excited
to try this I've never tried anything
like this a powder that you mix with
water to make a paste then you put it on
that's pretty cool this actually if I
were like traveling for like three weeks
like our honeymoon we're planning on
being gone for like three weeks and you
know I'm not going to want to
necessarily i might want to do i mean i
still want to take care of my skin and
um you know that's a long time and i'm
only gonna have so much room for liquids
so this might be awesome to just put
some powder in a smaller container and
i'll be able to do a mask still wanna I
don't know we'll see if I actually do
that but that is really really cool so
those are all the things in there again
we're not comparing they were both
really good honestly though if we were
comparing I liked it see stuff better
anyway and it was cheaper so but
hopefully that was enjoyable if you
enjoy check out my playlist of all of my
subscription box unboxings for the past
thousand years I'll link it below
