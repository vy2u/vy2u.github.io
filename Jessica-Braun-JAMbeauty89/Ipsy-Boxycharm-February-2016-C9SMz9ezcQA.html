be sharing with you my Ipsy versus
boxycharm for the month of February 2016
so let's go ahead and get into it now it
sees $10 a month I'll have my link below
this bag this month was actually really
cute it's kind of like like little dots
all along and it looks just like it's
you know like why did I want to say Doss
mode pixelated that's what I want to say
but then it's like the pink pleather on
the back I actually think it's really
really cute so the theme is pretty in
hashtag if see pink so let's see what's
in it okay see Oktay or cheok say I
never know how to say it from London
it's a well they typically sell yeah
nail polish so this is one of their
miniature ones and it's like kind of a
berry red color in the shade my go-to
red it's actually really pretty that may
be a really pretty like toe color we're
going on a cruise soon I know I've
already mentioned it once but I'm really
excited that would be really pretty so I
might I might try that next and even
though it's a mini and look oh it looks
like it's Olivia Palermo so she must
have done like a thing with them
collaboration so really pretty excited
to try that the next thing in here is
this chela passionate pink lip lip
pencil I think so I think the shade is
must be passionate pink and it really is
like a pencil
I tried chela brow products I've
actually liked those a lot
so it's certainly pink which makes it
look more enjoy the pain it's really
soft its I'm call it satin
not matte definitely not matte but of
course they don't claim that it's matte
but it's pretty and again the one nice
thing about pencils like this is that
you can actually kind of line your lips
and then fill it in which I like so kind
of has kind of a sweet smell but it's so
slight that if you're rather myself and
it would bother you alright the next
thing is this polidore faux duck came
right off enhancer baby eyes it looks
like it's like a nude okay so it must be
something it is like a nude color you
can see it like or I should even say
like peach colored so I wonder if you're
supposed to like put it on your lower
waterline just to kind of make your eyes
pop it really is small it's it was
smooth it doesn't blend well but I kind
of like that it doesn't budge because
once you get it there you don't want it
to move so that's kind of a good thing
but it almost might be for me I'm so
pale if that might almost be too dark
but for like everyone else in the world
it'd be fine so alright next thing in
here is this promised organic ultra
moisturizing argan cream facial lotion
with olive oil hunters that Natura
natural dermatologist tested paraben
free safe for sensitive skin so it's got
Moroccan argan and olive oil that deeply
moisturizes so that's not that I would
trade this again would be great for when
you're traveling because if you're only
traveling for a few days you just want a
moisturizer that works it definitely
smells strongly like I'm doesn't mean
it's not like olive oil kind of smells
like lemons but I like that smell but
again in skincare you don't always want
a fragrance because it can be an
irritant for a lot of people but it
smells really good so they do I'll try
that out though and then the last thing
in here is this Smashbox ooh ooh new
photo finish primer oil okay I haven't
even heard of this so I'm very intrigued
it's really small but I mean that's
probably enough to try for quite a while
it says our studio secret for radiant
perfectly prime skin on camera and off
it's an ideal canvas for makeup reduces
the appearance of dry fine lines that
would be nice increased moisture in just
four weeks use morning and night and let
it absorb into your skin before you
actually apply the makeup I will
definitely try this because this is
something that if it works if you do
have dry skin or like I've got fine
lines coming in of course that could be
really nice because a lot of times I
don't like to wear a lot of heavy makeup
day-to-day because it just in
chances though so alright we'll
definitely be trying out that's pretty
cool so all in all I mean I really like
the nail polish in that this lip product
is nice it really isn't actually a
really nice color the skin the
moisturizer we'll see I'll certainly try
the light nude colored thing then I'm
not super excited about but I am really
excited about the primer oil so that was
actually a pretty decent tip see bag
this month let's move into our boxycharm
which this one is more expensive it's
$21 month if C is ten but let's see so
the it says rush to relax from stiletto
to slippers get ready to work hard and
rest easy okay the idea of that so the
first thing in here is this tray look as
good as you are miss amazing
moisturizing mask so you open it okay
this is adorable
oh that's so cute so it's just one mask
my last some boxing video which was
fabfitfun and glossy box which is glossy
box was the same prices boxycharm and a
pixie box
they had one mask and I love doing masks
but part of me is like me and like you
only get to use it once so it's like I
don't know but I always get excited and
I do try them
some people like there's a picture
someone tried it on an airplane I'm
certainly willing to try love
moisturizing masks so that is pretty
cool the next thing in here is by offer
a cosmetics is it like an eye shadow it
says use in palettes and kits looks
really large though oh it's a really big
eye shadow but it's like a yellow nude
really really pigmented there it is
there that would be nice like under your
brow bone or just to kind of blend
things together especially if you have
more of a warm or yellow skin tone
that'd be really pretty so I will I
probably will use that next thing in
here is this beauty for real blush and
glow like a play on go because it's GL
oh well what is it cream blush and
Luminizer
so it looks like it's a dual little
thing here would be the cream blush
stick let's try it out
it's a pretty color it has a very sweet
frosting smell which I like but again if
you're sensitive to smells it's like
kind of a peach color a deeper peach
that's pretty smell really is good
the Luminizer is called so that was
called coral crushed by the way and the
Luminizer is called hi bean let's do it
right next to it it's actually kind of
deep for illuminizer but it'd look
beautiful if you do have a deeper skin
tone that is so pretty and again oops
it's got that same scent to it so I
might actually try this the one thing
that's hard about six like this is if
they're actually blendable and I'm gonna
try because sometimes you you like stick
them on or you even stipple like with
your brush onto there and then you can't
get it off the brush or you put it right
on your face and then you can't blend it
so so the high-beam blended pretty well
let's try the blush that seems to blend
decently well as well without leaving
really weird dark spots so I will
definitely try that
I'm never huge on cream blushes but
that's just because they don't stay they
always look nice but they don't stay so
I'm gonna try that one out
the next thing oh we're getting real
treat perfumes before real trio de
Parfum what if it's the same scent as it
was before it was like a law that was
like two years ago let's try it I don't
want to spring myself in case I don't
like it does smell really clean it's got
like this little tree branches on it
organ sneeze okay I just sneezed but
this just cuz I inhaled it it smells
really really good really clean this
might become I might switch out the
perfume I have my first right now I'll
put this in because this smells lovely
and light but sweet not super floral not
super spicy
it's just delicate and sweet I love it
okay this next thing says sponge jelly
sponge Olay you have my heart on the
string should ten body wash infused
buffer and polish so it sounds like it's
like literally a sponge on a little
string and it's got body wash and fused
into a sponge a heart shaped body wash
infused buffer is dual sided and
enriched with
hydrating olive oil and a blend of
energizing and toning extracts I will
definitely use that especially like
right now February to March such a dry
weird time of the year this will be kind
of a pleasure to use so I'm very excited
see you so that's so cute I've never
tried anything like that so the last
thing in here there's little fuzzies all
over it freeze 24/7 anti-aging eye serum
I just got an eye serum in one of my
other boxes just a clear eye serum it
has it does actually kind of have a
small again like a kind of citrusy smell
not very strong though but I'll try it I
might look it up to see like what the
claims are like if it's actually any
good helps reduce puffiness fine lines
dark circles and other signs of aging
around the eye area so I will try that
lovely so the things in that box that
I'm really excited about are the little
sponge thing because I just think that's
a cool idea
the perfume smells really good and I'm
actually really interested in this dual
sided thing because I haven't found one
that works and it blended pretty well on
my arms so I want to try it on my face
let me know what your favorite
subscription boxes are down below I'm
always curious to try new ones that I
haven't tried before and if you'd like
