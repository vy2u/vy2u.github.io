be unboxing three different makeup
subscription boxes for the month of
April we've got em see we've got
boxycharm we've got glossy box so let's
go ahead and get into it so let's start
with tipsy this is the cheapest one and
it's $10 a month I have info on prices
and links below so one of the things
actually was not in there it was
actually out of the back the bag before
we even get to that the bag feels kind
of cheap this it's like kind of I don't
know just I don't love it I mean it's
kind of cute but I kind of don't love it
you know I don't know I like the colors
in it though I should say but the first
thing that was kind of in it but outside
of it is all right like already excited
about it first of all look at the color
that is so pretty
this is the luxe II tapered highlighter
brush and actually when I see a brush
like this it's really soft
I like to use it to set my under eye but
I can see how this and actually you
could contour with it you could
highlight with it obviously you can get
right down your nose there's so much you
can do with this shape of a brush I'm
very excited and I'm excited that it's
soft and it is so pretty like I want a
whole set that looks like this so that
was awesome next thing is this jelly
pom-pom cosmetics blush + contour it
looks small to have both in there let's
up of this oh my that is tiny I'm trying
to think of what brush could fit in
there to actually use but let's swatch
them the contour seems like a perfect
contour shade for my skintone it
wouldn't be perfect for everyone and the
blush is pretty there they kick up a lot
of powder I started I have stains I
can't get the I just fill my Sephora
Minnie Mouse collection video and the
lip stains stain like they won't come
off so should have done that an order of
these different anyway so really pretty
actual powders but they're gonna be hard
to get to so I don't know that's kind of
a toss-up next thing is this Moroccan
oil treatment I know that who is it
someone here on YouTube that I love
loves the Moroccan oil
I'm ripping this box to get it open so
yeah it's just their classic Moroccan
oil treatment I've actually never tried
this I try other smells good treatments
but I like ones that are this size
because this is a kind of bottle that
shuts well that if you want to travel
with the hair oil you could always
refill this bottle even if it's a
different kind you know and you know
that it's smaller and it won't it's not
like a pump that's gonna get everywhere
so I'm definitely gonna try that I like
using that kind of thing just in the
bottom parts of my hair cuz if I get it
too high it just weighs it down ooh this
is the tarte lipsurgence lip cream in
wonder it's a smaller size oh it's a
pretty color though that is just a
really pretty classic kind of deeper
rose color yeah and these have that mint
smell and honestly it's kind of the
perfect size because those big ones I'm
like I've never ever used one of those
up ever so that is pretty freakin sweet
especially for a ten dollar bag I mean
this is a high end same with Moroccan
oil it's a nice brand the next or the
last thing in here is the nail polish my
speed and it looks like a pretty spring
color it's the brand Pro Bell nail
lacquer in the shade in or out
I like this color it's kind of that
purplish pink
it looks pretty pigmented I need to
repaint my nails so that might be my
next color so that's pretty awesome and
that's definitely a full size so
honestly this was one of the best this
might be the best if si I've ever gotten
I love this brush and it's not like a
tiny eye brush that I'm never gonna use
I'm very excited about Moroccan oil
which is also kind of expensive tarp is
expensive and then this I just wish it
were bigger but that's pretty awesome so
Wow I mean for ten dollars that was
absolutely amazing next one is boxycharm
which is twenty one a month let me wipe
off this other stuff so I don't have
more stains on my hand so the first
thing I'm seeing in here is this Oprah
long-lasting liquid lipstick and
Pasadena
I have heard amazing things about the oh
wow it is a deep it's a very deep color
it's pretty though I'll have to try it
because I'm curious about how this color
look on me although I maybe I could pull
that off these have that really nice
smell as well kind of vanilla II I love
that smell so definitely excited about
that next thing in here is this oh it's
that brand blink and it's their black
lash primer I know that their notes they
have that tubing mascara and the idea of
it really grosses me out
so I can't try I mean it literally
freaks me out I can't even try it
the idea that grosses me I know that
sounds terrible but if you know what I
mean then you know what I mean anyway
but this is their black lash primer and
I love I've been getting really into
mascara primers lately just because they
if it's a good one it actually works
especially when they're black or dark so
there's no white peeping through so I
will definitely use this definitely the
next thing in here is this your mineral
Sweden brown hypnotic looks like it's
just like a you know on mineral some
some kind of metallic mix out it's
really pretty
oh my gosh it's this gorgeous like light
taupe sparkly mess it's so pretty oh my
gosh what colors are sitting in hypnotic
this is absolutely stunning now I don't
really get into pigments often but when
it's this pretty are you kidding me
Brown hypnotic is what it's called that
is absolutely gorgeous so the next thing
in here is a full-size something it's
called a neuro Anderson Lillie Beach
butter hand cream in Manhattan Beach
this is like big but it feels like it's
not filled you know what I mean but I
will use this it's a thicker cream for
sure
it just has like a nice clean kind of
flowery scent it smells nice though so I
will definitely use that I mean
especially like just my arms I feel like
are always dry so that was pretty
awesome
and the last thing in this is the pure
least daily lip nourisher ooh they send
a lot of pure these things but it's
usually you know like face moisturizer a
face cleanser so I'm excited to try
something for lips from them
it's got mango and shea butter
petrolatum free yeah and it's just a
squeezy to its kind of gloss
see almost when you apply it but it
feels really like moisturizing so that
will definitely use so out of this I'm
gosh this is another good one because
I'm really excited with the mineral
which is rare for me really excited by
the lip thing the primer and the lip
cream and then the actual like hand
cream or whatever I mean I'll used it
I'm not super excited about that I'll
definitely use it but all of the other
ones I'm excited about so again another
really good box my goodness so lastly is
glossy box this one is also $21 and so
hard so first thing in here is a
two-faced product this is the Too Faced
melted liquefied long-wear lipstick and
it is in the shade Chihuahua let us see
so this is not the full full-size but
again this one this products you like
never use up unless like it's the only
thing you own it looks like it's gonna
be similar to that Pasadena color it is
kind of similar this one's a little more
Brown though or maybe a little more like
reddish actually it is really pretty and
these are a really nice formula I do
really like the Too Faced melted like
liquid lipsticks so that will definitely
use that it's so exciting
next things in here is it to the exact
same thing Oh wonder if that was an
accident or maybe they're just trying to
rid of I there are two of this this is
the vine Vera resveratrol skincare what
is it though it's like a cream is an eye
cream let me look on that actual thing
says lighting the foundation of its
skincare and the power of resveratrol
anti-aging effects vy0 holds this
ingredient at the center of its
collections setting the perfect moisture
barrier between your skin and outdoor
damage the day cream so it's a day cream
seamlessly protects and hydrates so
maybe you was supposed to come with two
that's nice and again is the perfect
light little travel size of these so
that's pretty awesome I went past the
other one onto my sister so she can try
it there's also a brush in this one it's
that same brand Luxy and it's got the
pink and gold and it's an angled one
this is their large angle again you
could use it for all the same uses the
other one could I just like the shape of
this other one just a little bit better
but they're both good they're both
really soft so I'm quite a collection of
these lucky brushes now because they
come I swear every month but they are
nice the next thing is this I love mango
and papaya sounds very springy oh my
just squirted a lot okay I'll just wait
oh man oh it's very it's got a strong
scent it smells good though it's
definitely like mango and papaya
I like that a lot actually and it's
again it's just a moisturizer it feels
nice doesn't feel like anything
extraordinary and the last thing in here
is this Aiko I do
uie I do liquid eyeliner now Aiko is
known for really good liners I know and
I've tried a couple of there's this one
it's a felt tip which I like it I like
it it's small you can really get in
there and I use one every day but it
doesn't seem as black as I had hoped
kind of kind of does that thing where it
kind of spreads and looks a little more
gray than it does black it's like a
crayola marker do you know what I mean
and I don't like that kind of thing oh
I've got it everywhere now oh my gosh so
I might I'll try it for sure I mean I'll
try anything
makeup wise but I don't feel oh my gosh
it's everywhere but I don't feel like
this is gonna be one that I absolutely
love like as much as my Stila stay all
day one that I love so all in all all
three boxes are pretty good I mean I
don't think glossy box I can't this is
awesome and the rest of the stuff I mean
it's okay so I feel like out of all of
whom gloss about sitting to press means
much other than this but box
determinants you're both amazing this
month so someone I was you know I read
your guys's comments and a couple of
people were commenting on my last one in
March saying you know they feel like you
know each company will have like a
really amazing month and then like kind
of a crummy month and then an amazing
month just to keep people like wanting
to subscribe and I'm like that's kind of
an interesting thought cuz you'll have
like a bad month and you're I feel like
why am i subscribed to this but then the
next month will be amazing and so if you
cancel you see on there
was amazing now I don't want to get that
you know so it's kind of one of those
like psychological thinking can they do
that on purpose I wonder maybe not you'd
like to assume the best that they don't
but it does kind of make you wonder cuz
it does kind of feel like it has those
hills and valleys I don't know anyway so
hopefully this was enjoyable and
informative for you guys if you are
interested in more subscription box
unboxings I know I just did a fab fit
fun one which is always fun that my box
is so crazy it's got too many amazing
things actually this necklace that I'm
wearing here I bought with the gift card
that came in a phat fit fun I can link
that video below I am getting the
swatches in my hair like it's everywhere
I need to go wash my hands so I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
