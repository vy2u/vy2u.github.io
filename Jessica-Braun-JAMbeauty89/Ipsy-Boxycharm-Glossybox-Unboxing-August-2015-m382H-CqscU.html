gonna do my subscription box unboxings
for August I'm a teacher how do I not
know what month it is I don't know it's
all running together I'm just excited
for fall so come on
so this is for August I've got MC
boxycharm in glossy box I am so blessed
that all three of these companies send
these to me for free to do with what I
want and I choose to unbox them here in
my channel because I just think they're
fun to share with you guys and a lot of
you guys really like seeing what's in
them each month so you can kind of
decide whether or not you want to buy
one of them or all of them or none of
them you know whatever so let's go ahead
an get into it alright so the very first
one will do is if see this one is $10 a
month it always comes in a cute bag
that's different and this is the bag
this month I don't like these makeup
bags that have the zipper about like a
fifth of the way down I don't know why
but it bothers me having this space up
here that I'm not using as much I'm just
picky but whatever so um now on the
little cart they had their luster luxe
and Michelle Phan are in it I know
Michelle Michelle fawns like a part of
it see I don't know if lustre Lux is
either I've never watched lustre Lux's
channel actually um anyway what's the
point of me telling yous I don't know I
just thought they looks cute in this
picture
so anyway let's go ahead and see what
the first thing feels like skincare this
is the Eco beauty good night night creme
it's a super hydration smoother and
plumper looking skin hmm it says it's um
gives you a visibly smoother and plumper
skin appearance rescues you from finding
wrinkles on the forehead and crow's feet
made with collagen producing peptides
hyaluronic acid shea butter aloe folic
acid vitamin E and then a whole bunch of
other stuff so that's pretty cool a lot
I think the packaging is interesting
where it's like a you kind of twist this
off and then you can get to the product
but I like you can actually shut it as
well because a lot of these kind of oily
type packs you can't so I like that and
it looks like there's actually a decent
amount in there so you know I think this
is just
trial size but at least it's enough that
you can actually try it more than once
and get an idea of if it's gonna work
for you or not so I will definitely give
that a try I'm actually getting close to
being out of my night cream so um the
next thing this is the scone scone
cosmetics as kayo any I think yeah luxe
doubler eye and lip pencil it looks like
it's a like a burgundy color
I mean burgundy makes me think of the
word Normandy and I think of if you know
the musical once upon a mattress there's
a song in it called Normandy no it's
that so up it's a beautiful song anyway
okay so I finally got it open so this is
I guess meant to be for your lips and
for your eyes ooh it's a little hot
creamier that I thought that is a collar
I love you guys know I love berry lips
of course I'm not wearing berry lips
today but I do most of the time and this
is so creamy right now my favorite berry
lip liner is this one from starlooks
called Terry's choice and it's just so
creamy but this is just about as creamy
and I love that color so this hat will
probably have a home in my collection
right away because I'm so excited to
give that a try s'more the next thing in
here is this doll 10 hydrogel cream
blush in flirt
now this looks like a peachy kind of
shade oh it's got a lot of pigment to it
right off the bat which can be good in
bed you know depending but it blends
really nicely right away which is so
important with cream blushes because if
you've got one that you put it on and it
just stains that area instantly you're
like well right Kim but this blends
really nicely now I'm not big on cream
blushes I think a lot of people are not
as well but are not either but this one
reminds me of my NYX one that I love so
much the boho chic
that's the shade of the next one that I
love so I will give this a try I'll
probably use my ELF stipple brush or my
Real Techniques stipple brush I love
well the next thing in here is and it
looks like another liner it's the deuce
a cosmetics I don't know how to actually
say that says it's waterproof and it's
in black okay that's exciting to me
because it's very very creamy and it's
the kind you have to sharpen but it's
kind of gray toned so you really have to
layer it on to get it to be black black
and it gets pretty black I don't think
it's the blackest I've ever seen that
it's still pretty black and if it really
is water if I'm gonna let this dry for a
little bit and then here in a minute all
swipe through and see if it stays put
but I'll definitely give this a try once
I run out of the black one I'm using
right now the last thing in here is this
BWC beauty without cruelty leave-in
conditioner I mean I don't use okay I
really probably should but I don't use
leaving conditioner is very often
because they just weigh my hair down so
but I'm always willing to try more
because this kind of smells manly musky
but I'm always willing to try some you
know because if there are any that don't
and there are some but anyway it smells
kind of musky I might see if Tyler wants
it because it's kind of a manly scent
but you know I don't mind because I
usually spray perfume into my hair later
anyway but so I've let that eyeliner dry
let's see yeah it's smeared a little bit
I'll let it dry some more not a ton
though I've had something that'll smear
my crazy but okay so that's everything
that was in the the hypsi bag I would
say that the well I'm excited about
three of the things I'm really excited
about this cream blush and I love that
it's like a normal sized one nice cute
little packaging I'm excited about the
eyeliner and I'm really excited about
this berry lip liner
I'm usually I feel like we always get
lip liners that aren't I don't know I
maybe it's just because I love berry
that's why I like it so pretty good for
ten bucks that's a lot and it that was
one of the better it's tea bags I think
we've gotten in a while now the next one
I'll open is my boxycharm this one and
the glossy box are twenty one dollars a
month so let's see what it feels like
heavier so it looks gorgeous
globetrotter must be the theme so it's
like travel theme oh whoa
so they've got the revealed 3 palette in
here now we got them revealed 2 palette
in was it also a boxycharm recently or
maybe misclassify see they all run
together but I think it was boxycharm we
got the revealed 2 palette which I
actually just recently decluttered cuz I
wasn't using it that's a whole thing if
I have that my newest declutter video up
I'll link it because I was a whole
process and a mindset change and it kind
of changed my life but anyway this has a
lot of very similar colors to that
they've got a lot of kind of pinkish
tones here there's a lot of neutral ones
over there which I really like just a
lot of satin it looks like there's maybe
one two three four shades that are matte
and the rest are mostly satin and a few
that have glitter glitter in it so I'm
gonna kind of swatch okay that's one of
the matte ones I'm gonna swatch that one
too
they're pretty that's just it these
shadows they can be really pigmented but
there's they kick up so much powder so
you really have to tap your brush off if
you're using a brush to apply it because
they can really kick up a lot of powder
this gold looks really pretty though
that cold air can you guys see it pretty
um you know overall I think they're nice
shadows if you can get a good deal on it
that's great but I don't know the
original price for these but sits over
like ten dollars I wouldn't say it's
worth it ten bucks would be a great deal
for this but you know but I will say
what I like is that it's got so many
colors so many colors so you're really
getting bang for your buck on that part
alone if you're wanting but you know if
they're nice they're not bad it's just I
think they're a lot better out there
that are even cheaper like elf
shadows NYX has some nice shadows
wet-and-wild has nice shadows anyway
alright but that is amazing that they
came in here so that is really exciting
the next thing this is the brand so
Susan and it is their statement skin
highlighting crayon mmm let us see okay
so it kind of you know it's like half
the size of a normal like you know like
lip crayons that they have but this is a
highlighting
ooh and it's got like a pointed tip now
the color is very curl essent white and
if you can kind of see yeah you can kind
of see it there but let me see how it
blends because if it oh it blends really
nicely this would look beautiful on your
cheekbones and this is so easy to do you
could almost just go Boop and then blend
it in circles or use like a small simple
brush from ELF
to blend it and you can even blend it up
here a little bit beautiful now it's
really shimmery so I personally wouldn't
take it like down my nose or anything
like that this is too shimmery but this
is beautiful this is a really really
cool product so I'm really really
excited about this this is something I
would probably just go out buy on my own
so that is cool the next thing is a mica
or mica Beauty cosmetics gel eyeliner in
black
finally colors we can use don't you guys
feel if you get subscription boxes v we
always get colors that are like eggplant
like I don't really use like a dark
purple gel liner that's just me though
so boring our knife anyway but I'm
really excited with the black I don't
really want to swatch it cuz that's not
really gonna I don't know that doesn't
really do much it's super black you know
is what it is super-dee-duper black
which is good it is a very this reminds
me of is that the one wild one I'm
thinking of that's just like super
slippery if you will but once it dries
it's really nice so we will see if once
it dries it's really nice but it's
certainly crazy black which is obviously
important in pieces the next thing is
this little tiny brush from the brand
Sita se ta seta Sita
it looks like it's just a liner brush
it's a really really thin I like the
light blue and this would be great too
you could wonder if you could use it to
line your lips I don't know but it's a
liner brush for very very precise work
you can even use it I'd probably be more
likely to use it like with a shadow on
my lower lash line but nice I don't know
that I have a brush this small so the
last thing in here is this another
leave-in conditioner
but this one's a full size now this one
has SPF SPF 15 for your scalp now I do
think that's pretty cool because if
you've ever been
son and got a burnt scalp there is
nothing worse than that it hurts so bad
in the weirdest way you know because
it's not an area that you usually really
feel much and so to feel that much pain
from a sunburn is terrible so that's
pretty cool if you live and like it well
if you're outside a lot it's gonna say
if you live in a beachy location but
even if you work outside or you're just
out a lot this really would be nice to
use on those days you know you're gonna
be outside so that's pretty cool it's
got like a pump to it very nice
very um different that's for sure the
last thing is the glassy box
now this one is newer to me but the
glossy box always has the cutest little
boxes that you can use you can kind of
reuse in your collection to organize
things and I love them because they
really are beautiful so any I always
some cute leave wrapped as well the
first thing I'm seeing in your ooh is a
full-size nail polish from spa ritual
and this is in the shade authentically
and it's one of their matte shimmer
colors so let's see these are a pretty
expensive brand of nail pusher this
looks beautiful this would be so pretty
it's like a shimmery pinky red I feel
like this would be so pretty at the
holidays I love colors like this and
this would be a really pretty toe color
as well because it'll catch the light in
a beautiful way look so that I'm excited
about and fun fact I found I saw these
when we went to the senses Spa which is
amazing when we stayed at the Grand
Floridian in Disney World they were
selling this bar ritual nail polishes
there so it kind of makes me smile and
makes me think of that that's cool
the next thing I'm seeing is this one
it's is the full-size this is a glam
glow product which gosh glam glow is so
expensive this is how many ounces oh no
this is not a full-size this is a trial
but it's pretty big
usually I had the glam glow samples I've
had are like half this size so this is
our youth cleanse daily clearing
cleanser it exfoliates cleanses and
renews your skin to make your skin glow
it transforms from the luxurious mud
into a gentle and effective foaming
lather that dissolves makeup and
impurities and removes dead surface
cells so a lot of the glam glow products
kind of that stuff where you I'm going
to open it right now because I want to
see ya where you put it on and then you
let it kind of dry and it transforms
from like a you know whatever color to a
different color to show that it's
pulling the impurities out of your skin
now I've read about some of the glam
glow products on polished choice their
Beauty pedia where they great stuff like
how good it is for your skin the
ingredients and I haven't looked up this
specific one but some of their products
are not rated very well on what's
actually in them and how they're really
not that great for your skin or not
necessarily that they're bad for your
skin but that a lot of the ingredients
aren't necessarily proven to actually be
doing anything for your skin so I don't
know I've never really tried any of them
so I will try it because I'm curious and
I'll probably look it up as well the
next product is their delish use I don't
know how to say it lip balm and it's
made in France it makes me think of my
honeymoon yeah and let's see if it's got
like a smell it's just kind of you know
a squeezy - it's kind of got a sweet
smell to it oh yeah oh my gosh they were
okay it smells exactly like vanilla pipe
tobacco there was this guy that used to
smoke outside of the church I used to go
to when I was growing up and he always
had his pipe and there was vanilla
tobacco in it and it smells amazing it
really does smell good and that is
exactly what this smells like
I Tyler's in the other room I can't wait
to have him smell this because he's
gonna know it smells exactly like it so
but it feels really really smooth I
wonder what it says about it it's got
it's a summer - ceci buh-buh-buh-buh-buh
paraben free it's rich in antioxidants
which includes tip s complete extract
the mexican plant known for its
regenerative capabilities and nutritive
macadamia nut oil they come you could
have gotten a different flavor it's 550
for that full-size so the good news is
if I like it I could buy it again
doesn't really break the bank so I like
things like that and I really like this
melt next thing in here is this mana
conditioning lash primer now I just
filmed a video earlier today about
products that I was disappointed in and
if it's up I like it but one of the ones
I was disappointed in was this lash
primer from ELF that I hated and you
guys know I love out but I hated it and
it wasn't like a fiber one it was just
like this white gel that just didn't do
anything in fact it just clumped my
lashes and this looks similar but this
looks like a way thicker gel this almost
looks like Elmer's glue open it and
smell like Elmer's glue no it doesn't
really have a smell so I will definitely
try it I'm curious to see what a lash
primer like this is supposed to do
because this is a more expensive brand
let's see not that that makes it better
but I'm just a little more apt to think
that maybe this is more like what that
primer was supposed to be like I don't
know so this the full size is $24 this
is just a trial size the primer
nourishes your lashes to prevent flaking
while ensuring your look stays on oops
we'll see it says after just a little
tip it's it's after cleansing your face
at night comb the formula over clean
lashes to wake up with fresh condition
last lashes that's pretty cool I've
never thought about doing that don't
know if I want to sleep it at all but
that's an interesting thought putting
this on at night so maybe your mother
let's see last thing in here which I
just finally was able to open is this
pop Beauty Kajal pen so it's got a black
liner on one side that's creamy and
black and it is pretty black just like
the other one was but then it's got a
smudger on the other side which is
always nice oh it says it's in the shade
city black it said oh no it didn't it's
in the shade city black so then you can
kind of smudge it a little bit wow it
smudges away a little too easily though
so I don't think this is necessary a
liner that's gonna stay put but if
you're just smudging it like maybe on
your lower lash line it'd be good but I
don't know that if you're wanting a
crisp line this might not
one for you because it's slipping
everywhere but I'll try it again and
give it more time to try so those were
all of the things I would say they all
had pretty good stuff and I'm like the
reveal columns in the boxycharm and I'm
really excited about the lip balm and
the nail polish in this and even the
glam glow just to try it because it is
an expensive product and then empty bag
was really nice too so these were always
a pretty good month for subscription
boxes I would love to know what
subscription boxes you are subscribed to
what you love about them maybe I will
try out some other ones I've kind of
been only doing these three for a while
but I love them and I'm always looking
out for new ones that are out there so
definitely let me know down below so if
you love subscription box videos as much
as I do I can link my playlist of all of
my past videos on all of this stuff and
even some other ones I've tried as well
down below if you're interested and if
you enjoyed please subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
