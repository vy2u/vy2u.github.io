going to go through what came in my Ipsy
bag for this month of July and also in
my boxy charms so let's go ahead an get
into it if she is $10 a month and I
usually start with that one I've got
links and info about both of these below
alright so the the bag is really kind of
cute it's got this like holographic but
kind of like this rainbow metallic look
to it it looks like those are a little
like beach umbrellas it says if see and
just got like a blue I'm excited zipper
so it says the heat is on hot summer
nights so let's go ahead and dig in the
first thing on top looks like an
eyeliner
it says model launcher felt tip eyeliner
in Emerald Isle
alright so it's a true felt tip it draws
like a crayola marker eye I'm gonna be
honest about that it's kind of
see-through I mean it's pretty it's a
pretty color it's not like it's not
usable by any means but if you're
wanting like a like color that's so
pigmented you can't see through it this
is not it it really is it reminds me of
coloring like with the crayola marker
that's exactly what it feels like but
it's a really pretty color so again it's
not like it's not usable it's not
necessarily bad it's just I I've seen a
lot better um so okay next thing is from
embryo lease and it's their
multifunction nourishing moisturizer if
you like we usually get some kind of
skincare in each bag Wow says this is
talking about this this universal
multi-purpose care has spanned decades
and has been passed on from mother to
daughter still a great favorite among
dermatologist for its tolerance its
simplicity and effectiveness for the
whole family this exceptional product is
today much loved by all beauty
professionals as well as a giant
statement makeup artists have discovered
its countless virtues under the
spotlight to the point that it's become
an indispensable product it's the beauty
secret of models and actresses whose
skin is overstressed by makeup and
makeup removal well I certainly have
worn a lot of makeup in my 27 years so
awesome I will definitely try this okay
next thing is
it says trust-fund beauty all these
boxes always look so beat-up it cracks
me up like what happened in the shipping
ooh
so this is like a lavender but a really
light almost creamy color this is
beautiful
it looks pretty opaque oh my gosh this
is so beautiful and it looks like it's
got kind of a it just looks really
creamy and I feel like colors like this
can be really difficult because they're
either not very creamy and they're hard
to apply or they're just so transparent
that you have to put on a million layers
it's not even worth it's gonna chip
really quickly so this I am absolutely
excited about coming out that's really
pretty
next thing awesome this is from Too
Faced so that's kind of a big deal this
is their hangover RX face primer and I
have the full-size and I actually really
like it and I didn't think I would I
thought was kind of gimmicky I don't
know that it's fantastic for your skin
but it feels really nice and it has a
nice coconut scent if you like that so
that is seriously awesome I love when
they include really cool things like
this and of course the idea behind these
things is you might find a product you
love that you want to buy the full size
of so that is so cool
the last thing in here is by Elizabeth
ma it's the show me your cheeks blush in
peach pink similar those like plastic
packages but it looks like it might be a
full-size blush I mean it looks really
pretty kind of reminds me of well I
don't know it's not super-dee-duper
pigmented when you swatch it but with
blushes I've kind of come to learn that
I don't mind that
it leaves room for error which I like
but also a lot of the best blushes like
even the Tarte blushes that are like
people love those don't swatch like at
all on your hand they're very they're
not very good at fingers watch so they
look amazing on the skin so you know you
can't really judge these by that but it
feels really smooth and soft and it
doesn't kick up a lot of powder which I
like and it is kind of a pretty
iridescent pinky peachy color set every
Beauty person ever about any color
peachy pinky
I mean right so all awesome products I
am very excited about those that again I
feel like if she has kind of turned it
around because I think other than maybe
the liner I'm not huge like a huge fan
of everything else I really like and the
bag is really cute
our next box is boxy trim this one is
more expensive it's $21 a month and so
usually it's like full-size products
which I feel like it should be for that
price so the first thing in here is is
it PYT
argan oil from Morocco oil treatment
says there's no animal testing apply a
dime sized amount of serum into palms
use more or less depending on your hair
length and thickness rub your hands
together and distribute evenly through
hairs so this is something that it's a
nice size again if you know you like
oils in your hair especially I'm like I
mean if you're like most people you
shouldn't put it from like anywhere near
your scalp it's just too oily for that
but for any hair type it's wonderful in
like the bottom half just because it
really does help to nourish and
moisturize those areas that can get
really stressed easily from heat styling
etc so this will definitely come in
handy for that next thing is this noia
in a yeh natural lip gloss what shade it
says it's in Malbec that's my favorite
kind of wine alright
it is definitely a full-size it reminds
me of Tarte packaging it's got kind of
the wooden handle looks really really
nice it's got like a little like cherry
blossom branch or whatever you'd call
that it looks like it's a pretty bright
pink color let's see and it is very
bright but again for summer I'm not I've
said before on my channel I'm not huge
on really pigmented lip glosses that are
bright Pink's or bright Reds because if
I'm going to go a bright route like that
on my lips I want it to stay in place
and not budge that's usually when I
reach for a lipstick or something like
that so I'm not always a big fan of this
but I'm willing to give this a try
because I saw I remember whose video it
was the other day and she had like a
pink gloss on and it just looks so
pretty and feminine and I thought maybe
I should give those
a try so I think this is a perfect way
to try it
awesome so and it it I don't think it
has really I don't think has a smell at
all
the packaging is beautiful so that is a
total win
oh here's the card so the lipgloss was
$16 Wow it's made without sulfates
parabens earth-friendly bamboo awesome
and then the argan oil is $30 jeez
Louise yes so that's awesome and it says
this is safer color treated hair next
thing in here is from malli which I know
Emily Noelle 83 loves malli
this one is $18 it's their ever color
star light waterproof liner in ice blue
I actually that's oh that is so pretty
look at that color it's like a baby blue
oh my gosh really creamy again just it's
gorgeous when it catches the light I'm
actually today just before this video I
filmed myself putting my makeup on
because I'm doing a waterproof test
video of drugstore products now another
thing I'm thinking about doing is doing
a high-end version of that as well let
me know if you'd be interested because
this is an expensive product that claims
to be waterproof and I'm so curious if
it actually is so very cool um last
thing now usually it comes with five
items but I'm seeing on here there's
only four so I don't know if they're
just like permanently switching to four
which I hope not because they haven't
changed the price at all or it's like
this last product is bigger and that's
why because it looks like that says it's
$59 it's this Oprah Pro palette like a
magnetic one just like z palettes but it
one two three four five six shadows
oh my gosh and these are all over
Shadows oh it doesn't say the name on
them I hate that um but these are all
really pretty colors that's so cool so
it says this professional magnetic
palette made exclusively for boxycharm
comes equipped with a mix of six shimmer
and matte eyeshadow palettes or
eyeshadows look this looks like there's
three shimmers and three mats they
normally retail $10 for each pan well
that's crazy because Mac ones in the
pain
are $6.00 now so it seems crazy that
they're charging that much so these look
I mean they feel really really creamy
these are really nice so there's you can
see it there's all six of them there
these really are nice and they don't
kick up a ton of powder which i think is
kind of huge which means it's probably
gonna be less fallout and this shimmery
shade that's like kind of a kind of
olive green and gold is really really
beautiful so I mean I wouldn't pay $59
for this I'll tell you right now but
that's still so freakin awesome that it
came in this oh my gosh so I mean this
with this and the full-size lip gloss in
the eye liner that's absolutely awesome
and then add in this argan oil to that I
know I'll use these are all useful
products they're gonna kind of switch up
my routine a little bit I've come to
realize that you know with these I think
for me the fun is that it makes me
switch things up a little bit it's so
easy for us to get stuck in a rut
especially you know when you love makeup
as much as I think both of us do and
you've got enough of it that you know
you've really found your favorites and
you stick to them but it's so fun to get
different colors you might not try even
like this eye liner color just switch
things up and keep things exciting and
stay fresh with each season so that's
kind of why I've come to love
subscription boxes I was thinking about
that last night in bed anyway so all
awesome I need to go wash my arm and
hand and everything but I mean honestly
both of those that might be this might
be one of my favorite months for both of
them they just came with such great
products I feel like both of them are
really stepping up their games and it's
so exciting for us the consumer so
hopefully you enjoyed this I will link
all of my other subscription boxes well
it's all on a playlist not going all of
them that would be ridiculous
but I like to play this if you want to
watch some more of these maybe see what
some of the past ones came with so that
way if you're trying to make a decision
about whether or not you want to
subscribe to one or the other you can
see what the pattern is and if you think
it would be worth it for you or not
other than that I hope that you'll catch
more of my videos and subscribe and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
