share with you guys an unboxing of my
Ipsy bag for this month and also my
boxycharm
now these are two different prices if C
is ten boxycharm is twenty one but I
like just showing them together as much
as I can when they come around the same
time in the month because that way it's
kind of like lumped together if you're
curious about makeup subscription boxes
in general if you curious about what I'm
wearing on my lips because I get asked
quite often it's a pink color but it's
the max that posed in line and it's
called dangerously red but in my opinion
this is absolutely a beautiful pink I
don't know but I love the packaging and
a lovely subscribers send me this and
I'm so grateful to her anyways so let's
get into it
oh also okay there's like 10 million
like caveat sweet before we start but
seriously if I sound insane and nasal
and if I like I'm acting like a zombie
it's because I'm on allergy medication
right now I am okay
holla if you hear me if you have
horrible allergies and I mean to the
point where like I'm I can't do anything
for like the like rough week in the
middle of my allergies where like I am
literally seizing every like minute it's
not like twice a minute and my nose is
running so much and my eyes are like
itchy and red and puffy I woke up this
morning my eyes like could barely open
they were so puffy it's so bad so if you
have any recommendations of things that
can help please let me know below I'm
like desperate I still wanted to film my
shower get all those allergens off of me
I'm feeling a lot better but I still
sound a little bit nasal so just that's
why FYI
that right so Wow alright in C let's
start there so this one's $10 a month
always comes in a nice happy bright pink
bag and this one says destination chic
greetings from and this says fill in the
like where are you now Indianapolis
that's not very exciting Oh Q so it's
kind of like a little postcard type
thing so let's see the bag that's always
the true test oh this is different okay
so it's clearly like travel themed the
blue and white I love makes me think of
Greece to be honest but it has a little
snap which is kind of rare if I can snap
it why can't
I said I didn't learn how to snap in
kindergarten there we go so if you're
asking why I'm looking up I know a lot
of you guys have asked in recent videos
Tyler just learned how to hook up the
camera to the monitor and so I'm always
trying to check if I'm even in frame at
all so I'm trying to look up very often
but it's sometimes hard like to see am I
even in focus am I in the frame um this
is a really cute blue and white bag and
it's kind of like envelope style which
they I don't know that I've ever
received one from them that's like this
alright so first thing oh this is a
cosmetics it's there no tub waterproof
gel eyeliner looks like it's a trial
size okay so it says it's clinically
proven anti-aging long wear pencil
infused with hydrolyzed Silkk collagen
peptides and antioxidants oh whoa it
says first ever waterproof automatic gel
pencils so when they say automatic oh it
rolls up okay so it twists up it's not a
sharpening kind let's see here's the
test okay it is really creamy and gel
like and it's pretty black but it's not
as black let me like layer it a couple
times alright so if you layer it it does
get blacker I will say that but like for
example today would have wear on my eyes
and it might not come across on camera
I'm wearing a really glittery pure eye
cosmetics like liquid kind of cream
that's making no sense I'll link what
I'm talking about below but it's really
really glittery and shimmery and so when
I'm putting eyeliner on top of it a lot
of the eyeliners I own won't go over
that glittery portion very well where
the glitter will still shine through and
I don't want that so I'm curious about
if this would work over that you know
says it's waterproof it's smudging right
now but maybe I didn't give it enough
time to dry I don't know I'll certainly
use this I mean black pot eyeliners are
so useful to me anyway next thing in
here is this handle a limp treatment
it's kind of like this cream colored
packaging like a squeezy tube and it's I
mean it seems like it's a thick like
kind of oh it's very thick it's like a
petroleum jelly type consistency if not
even thicker that's about the same it
has like a vanilla scent
it feels good my lips have been chapped
recently so I'm curious to try this it
looks like you know I used that much and
it's already like dense it in pretty far
so Sean it's done in there but that is
useful to me as well so that's good next
thing is a brush does it have a brand
inspir I don't know if it's inspired
Insp are it looks like it's an eyeshadow
brush that'd be good for like blending
out the crease and ie that's again the
theme of this must be like useful
products for Jessica because this is
actually useful to me as well feels
really soft and it's just about the
right size to get right in the crease
and just blend out one thing I've been
using these for a lot lately is when I
use I've been really into cream shadows
and so like today I use that one from
pure cosmetics I mentioned and the
problem I used to find with that was I
would have this really weird jagged line
where that ends so what I've been doing
is taking a clean brush about exactly
the size and just before it dries just
kind of blending it the crease so that
it kind of you know with no shadow at
all it's just kind of blending that area
so that there's no harsh line because
for me that's not the look I'm going for
so this will be very useful to me next
is this jelly pong pong cosmetics I've
gotten something from them before their
bronzer duo and Caribbeans Sun so it's
just black packaging with light pink
writing and again okay I don't remember
if this is FC boxycharm what it came in
but it's a really it's a cute duo and if
I remember right yes it's nicely
pigmented but yeah it's very pigmented
but it's such a small pan that you have
to use a really small brush to get it
out and I don't like that because I
don't like applying blush and bronzer
with a small brush so that's about the
only downside the packaging is you know
cute simple it's a good product so I
know this top is from stitch fix and
it's that box I just got this month so
the last product in here is from Ava NYC
if they're hungry hair oil treatments
and it's a really small one one thing I
know about this company is that their
hair products always smell incredible
like so sweet and lovely but light so I
will definitely
amuse out of this especially on the ends
of my hair so that was everything in the
Ipsy bag let's move on to the boxycharm
box each arm is more expensive it's $21
months so there's usually more full-size
products in it usually we're gonna say
so their little card says spring vibes
it's more than a feeling more than a
feeling um I just did that all right
let's see what's in it okay it looks
like a lot of good stuff I'm gonna start
with the thing on the was excited about
already it's a makeup geek product
I've tried makeup geek blushes and
eyeshadows and they're literally both
incredible and I know there's a lot of
hype on youtube about it for good reason
well hey she's a youtuber so it makes
sense that there's a lot of hype but
they're actually incredible products for
an actually reasonable price the only
thing I would recommend is you know look
for promo codes like if there is free
shipping or anything or make sure you're
ordering enough to make it worth paying
for shipping I mean that would be my
recommendation for anything online the
packaging is adorable it feels like
metal and it's like heavier and it's it
says mg for makeup geek and it's a blush
in XOXO this looks like a really pretty
small spring color it's a very bright
very pigmented coral but again you know
use the stippling brush or just use a
light hand and it's gonna look really
pretty the makeup geek blushes last
forever I have one in secret admirer and
it's a really pretty like blue tone
lighter pink and is so beautiful but it
didn't come in this packaging so I
wonder if this is new for them it is
really cute it feels so luxurious and
high-end so good for them good for
Marlena she seems like a lovely person
to be honest so that I am like
incredibly excited about that's one of
those kinds of things that if I like
that blush I might go buy like one or
two more because the packaging is nice
the quality is amazing it stays on all
day just all-around good the next thing
is this ella and mila nail-polish oh let
me tell you the price so that blush is
was $15 was it that much when I bought
blush within the past year feel like
it's gone up in price maybe I don't know
maybe I'm wrong so this nail polish is
ten dollars
50 Cent's what's the color does it say
looks like it's like a light green who
it is
pistach as in pistachio it's as in
pistachio that is a beautiful it's like
a mint green but it has a hint of light
lime in it and I guess they're symbols
like an elephant so this is really cute
let's see if it is opaque looks pretty
opaque I am excited
I haven't used Mint polish in a long
time and I'm kind of in that kind of a
mood so I'm excited they give this a try
so the next thing in here is this it's
this brat the brow gal by Tanja crooks
clear water-resistant eyebrow gel I'm
already excited I use clear brow gel
every day
honestly I've tried so many I like a lot
of them but my favorite that I go back
to time and time again is the Anastasia
one only because yes it's like 20
dollars or so but it like it makes your
brows stay in place
period they don't move everything else
I've tried it works pretty well but it's
not like solid that is solid so I'm
curious especially it's saying its
water-resistant that makes me think it
might be similar so this one costs well
$20 originally as well so though it
sounds like if I like this I'm gonna be
paying the same price anyway but and
it's clear which I also like because I
find that when I use colored ones are
tinted ones they just get all over the
skin around my eyebrows and I'm like
what am i doing like I'm white you're
nothing like why am I not just using a
clear one because the color I don't
really need if I'm adding it in with a
pencil anyway so it's like a matte black
packaging it's very it's like the size
of mascara if you will and it's about
honestly it's the same exact type slowly
as the anasazi one I'm just gonna brush
it through my brows see I like that the
brush is not super oh I like that the
brush is not super wet because with some
of them you know you get so like it's
such a huge block you end up having to
like tap off all the excess and you're
like dang I'm like wasting that so I
mean it feels good we're gonna see I'll
have to test it in a second see how it
dries so very excited about that so the
next thing
I just unwrapped and it had I swear to
you two layers of shrink wrap on it and
it took forever this is the star Lux Lux
lip liner in charmed and it's the star
looks hearts boxycharm on it which is
cute
it's a retractable one and it looks like
a color ooh a very pretty just coral
kind of well really truly a warm pink
color it got it's very creamy very
opaque and pigmented so this will be
very useful I don't know that I have a
color like this to be honest I might
have some similar but not quite as warm
so that is really nice that retails for
in 1950 so this next thing is this
double ego it's from pur cosmetics
they're dual ended eyeliner this retails
for $21 is it a is it like it's a liquid
liner okay it is straight up turquoise
you see that it's a beautiful color so
if you like color like that you'll love
this and okay and this is a pencil
retractable so that's why it's dual
ended oh and this one's a little bit
deeper so the more blue tone one is the
pencil and the liquid one has more of
like a greenish turquoise type feel so
that's kind of fun if you really like
that or like if you're going in like a
beach or a cruise vacation you know
you're gonna like that pop of color this
would be the perfect little tool to
bring along with you the last thing in
this box is by Catherine Malandrino
romance de Provence what is it though
this is their Deluxe mini sprayer and
it's $20 retail it looks like a small
except Li like a little spray what is it
it says discover the timeless allure of
breathtaking Provence with this intimate
floral okay up up up it opens with
fruity nuance this apparent blackcurrant
that sounds awesome at the heart jasmine
rose and violet blossoms bloom on a
gourmand base of vanilla patchouli and
tonka bean tonka bean hey that actually
smells really good it's a perfect mint
and I'm even a little stuffed up I can
still smell it it's a perfect mix of
that
like floral but it's mostly sweet so
like I okay that's like right up my
alley reminds me of like if you mix
misty or with Coco Mademoiselle like the
Chanel perfume like I feel like if you
mix those two you'd get this as smells
really really nice so that was a lot
both of those boxes honestly this month
were pretty darn good I don't know that
I could ever pick a winner of course
they're different prices anyway so it
doesn't matter but but I mean I'm
impressed with all of them the only
products I was kind of disappointed in
again for like the second month in the
row is this jelly Hong Kong one I wish
it was just bigger but I'm excited about
like the star luxe lip liner I'm very
excited about the makeup geek blush and
that mint nail-polish the brow gel seems
nice the pure mineral seems really nice
I mean there's tons of really good stuff
even like the that lip treatment from
the beginning I'm actually excited to
use if you enjoy subscription box videos

a half years worth No
