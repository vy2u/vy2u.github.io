unbox three different subscription boxes
I've got boxycharm if see in star box
I'm just waiting for my glossy box to
come but it still hasn't come and I'm
like ah it's been too long and I don't
even know if this the right month
anymore I think it's I guess it's April
so see I'm already late so there we are
I think so we're just gonna see as we
open them I'm so excited I am very
blessed that these companies send these
to me for me to unbox on my channel of
course this is one of my jobs and it's
wonderful that I can do it without
having to have that extra expense to
share with you guys so I am so excited
let's get started we're gonna start from
the top down the boxycharm is the most
expensive one this one's $21 star box is
15 and then if C is 10 I think that's
right I'll have links for these below if
you are interested but let's get started
so boxycharm like I said it's 21
it is April so their theme this month is
April bloom and I just got excited okay
let's start simply this is the cool way
they've sent something from the brand
coiba for smoothing lotion smooth
manageable healthy hair with no frizz
and it says it's two ounces whatever it
is okay so it's a it's just a lotion
with like a little pump to try in your
hair let's try it out sometimes with
these it just weighs my hair down so
much that it's not it's not the end
worth it
I actually am trying this like protein
spray that my hair stylist or hair
cutter what's the word my iPhone know
that she suggests and recommended and I
am loving it which I'll probably show
here soon anyway it's not starting yet
but so I will probably try it I don't
know but like I said some of these just
weigh my hair down because my hair is
naturally really fine and so I turn not
to use too much of this but I might pass
this on to a sister that I know would
love it but if you're looking for
something I mean that is awesome to have
that big of a size in here so alright
next thing is this vincent longo oh wow
feel like that's an expensive brand i
don't really know to be honest duo eye
pencils
there's satin and plum and so satin oh
is like this mmm it doesn't look very
pigmented it's like this kind of
purplish more like an indigo and then I
drop this like five times and then this
is plum oh this one looks a little more
pigmented it's like this bright blue so
I like the idea of the duo and these are
definitely colors I don't have like this
especially that like bluish color in
that cool so I think that's kind of fun
and I like the duo ended like if you
want it if you wanted to throw this in
your bag to have two very different
options with you and not take up a lot
of space that's perfect okay next thing
in here is this whoa a harvey prints
perfume let's just see here okay so it's
like I think it's a little rollerball
this is the Harvey Prince signature oh
that does smell nice it's definitely
florally I'm just gonna do it and it's
just a rollerball I'm showing you like
you can see but it's just a little
rollerball metal one but it's certainly
a lot of product in there to try it out
it's nice it's not you guys know I'm not
big on floral scents and I feel like
I've gotten a lot in recent boxes but it
is a nice scent so I'll definitely I
mean I'll give it a try for a little
while certainly perfect for spring and
if you love floral you probably really
would like this cuz in the range of
floral scents this is one that I
actually could see myself growing to
like which is a big deal to me alright
next thing is this Oprah or Ofra I'll
never know how to say it pink sapphire
dream mineral powder let's see okay so
it's just like in a little sifter type
thing is this like a highlight oh it's
just open it is it's like a light pink
really looks like a really shimmery
highlight let's just see it whoa you
could almost use that as like an eye
shadow so it's right there yeah that is
really shimmery it's pretty though it's
got a really fine glitter in it I'm
guessing that that would be fallout city
Magoo because I mean that just fell all
over the box let alone all over your
face so I
don't know I will certainly try it this
might be a great duster like on your
body like maybe actually that might be
still too much I don't know but I think
I will try and find a way to use this
because this could be nice maybe you
know my wedding day just like on my
decollete if it's not too much we're
just gonna have to try it out see before
the wedding I will try it out see okay
the last thing in this box is this oh
this is what I talked about earlier the
coastal is it yeah Coastal Scents
revealed too now I know that earlier in
the year I didn't get the boxycharm like
they didn't send it to me I don't know I
guess they forgot about me no and it was
already sold out I was like well I'll
just go buy it it looked amazing but if
it's like sold out or something weird
and I want to say that in that box the
reason it sold out was because the maybe
was the original revealed palette was in
it for maybe it was this one again I
don't know regardless um I am so excited
to try this out because ever talks about
it and I kept thinking about buying it
and I'm like okay the last thing I need
is another palette but it's I mean
there's so many shades in it like look
at this there's 2 4 6 8 10 times to 20
20 shadows in this and I've heard
they're really pigmented let's just see
whoa that one was kind of powdery though
but they are like I'm gonna get a matte
one too so this is them swatched yeah
that's incredible I mean come on these
are more like rosy tone similar like The
Naked 3
I know everyone compares everything to
the naked palettes but it's an easy
point of reference to make most people
know at least most makeup nerds know
what we're all talking about
so that gosh that alone is pretty much
worth it and yet you get all those other
products so that's pretty cool this is
one of the best things I've ever gotten
in a boxycharm awesome let's move on to
star box this one is $15 a month they
the other ones you get lots of different
brands Starbucks only sends you their
brand which is star looks some of the
products are really overpriced that's my
honest opinion I know they send this to
me but you guys know I'm always gonna be
honest their products regular price are
ridiculously overpriced for what they
are that's my opinion
but what's nice about this is for $15
you do get to try like
three sometimes four full-size products
of theirs that are overpriced otherwise
and I will say some of the products I've
loved like their gel liner I love like
the black they had a lip gloss in
guilty-pleasure which I need to get the
full size up it is the most amazing lip
gloss ever anyway okay so this first
thing what we already opened it is their
lip gloss so good because I do actually
like their lip glosses in blush yes and
it looks like a really iridescent kind
of rosy color it is that is pretty
though that's a very wearable dusty
color that's got a little shimmer I feel
like a lot of these colors can look
almost like too much even during the day
but this looks really wearable it
actually probably looked nice over this
by the way on my lips is my only NARS
lipstick like ever in Anita which i
think is really it's just a really
pretty easy color but this would look
nice over so cool
next thing is lip liner and tickle me
pink now this looks like a they sent a
lot of lip liners recently and they're
good they're actually pretty darn good
for the pencil format but this one is
looks more the other ones have been like
that dusty color this is a true pink
that looks pretty that's one that I
think is gonna be a great one to go with
virtually any pink lipstick I mean
obviously the last thing in here is um
what it says it's a makeup remover pen
now I love my ELF one actually I will
grab it because it's in my everyday
makeup for you because I use it every
single day there elf makeup remover pen
is $3 and it's literally got just makeup
remover in it and you use it you can use
it to like clean up your wing or
anything anything you need literally for
anything so interesting that they have
their own so starlooks makeup remover
pen let's just see oh that's it's black
I was like is it a liner no it's just
clear I mean it just removes makeup
let's try it on like the lip liner whoa
so you can see it kind of like went
right through it wow that's pretty cool
so oh and you can still see it let me
wipe that off this
we'll definitely be used by me this is
useful they should just put one of these
in every single box I could buy anyway
so that's pretty cool so that's all that
was in that one um that you know I have
to be honest some of my complaints with
Starbucks in the past have been that
they're not very like a lot of the
things they said haven't been very
wearable like it'll be a bright yellow
eye shadow I'm like I'm not gonna wear
that or like a bright orange lipstick
which I know a lot of people like and
it's semi on-trend now but for me I'm
like I'm not gonna wear it though so I
just get rid of it but these are all
very useful products to me so at me I
mean I think they've really stepped up
their game when it comes to that now
tipsy the bag I already took it out of
the pink sleeve cuz I was just trying to
declutter my room is a mess this is
adorable this might be the cutest bag it
feels so well-made it actually feels
like it's woven you know what I mean
it's so cute so this is what I'm
definitely gonna be using let's dig in
alright the first thing in here is this
makeup Beauty cosmetics eye primer is it
like a oh yeah it is it's just like a
neutral but here see here's the thing if
you're light-skinned like me that would
totally work but what if you aren't what
if you have way darker skin in any
format that's not gonna work I mean
unless you're just using it as like a
discolor and you're wanting to go way
light on your eyes but I mean as a true
primer that is only gonna work for you
know half the world it's something to
think about anyway but it does it seems
you know creamy ish I don't know I mean
to be honest it feels kind of cheap I'll
try it
alright we'll see but it kind of feels
cheap all right this is ooh it's just
cute little tin and it's this
all-natural tinted lip and cheek balm
whoa
if you saw my perfectly posh video this
looks like that dark darling stain oh
but it's like it's a really it looks
dark but it's more of a jelly color so
it's not gonna look like that yeah you
can't see it down there it's not gonna
look like this doesn't really have a
scent or anything that could be nice
that almost might mean again a good
Travel thing because it's not really a
liquid liquid although they might
counter this one but it doesn't take up
a lot of room and you can use it on your
lips and your cheek so it's
multi-purpose that's kind of cool what
brand is that Oh Mullen and Sparrow
they've sent something else from them
before okay Oh a jewel eg nail polish
I've actually never I know she's a
youtuber here and I've seen some of her
videos she seems so nice but this is her
line in what shade b56
beef I've seen I don't know it doesn't
say oh yes it does damsel this is such a
pretty this would be beautiful in the
spring and summer be a really good
toenail polish color too I love classic
pinks like this don't you guys anyway so
that is really cool because I've never
tried any of her polishes okay next is
this red Ken windblown 0/5 oh it's a
hairspray a dry finishing spray so oh
that don't get used for sure and I love
that it's travel size I love getting
high-end travel sized things because
then I'm like I'm so rich but I feel
like it when I can travel something
expensive but it's just because I'm
getting em subscription boxes no I cause
I'm rich cuz I'm not I'm a teacher
alrighty so the last thing in here is
this nude dude eyes shadow in flirty
looks like a really pretty like rose
gold kind of brown color let's get it
somewhere so we won't there we go we'll
put it there it's not crazy pigmented
but you know sometimes I don't mind that
because sometimes when something's so
pigmented it's a double-edged sword
because you've got to be so careful with
it and be intentional about where you
place it but you know that is a pretty
kind of more of a it's rose gold but
it's almost more rosy than Goldy that
makes sense I don't know I'm really
excited about this bag to be honest so I
think out of all of them even though
they're all totally different prices so
it's hard to compare I really liked the
well I mean the boxy charm I was just so
excited about this but then with FC I
was really excited about the bag and the
nail polish I mean they're all good and
star
looks is always pretty good but you
don't get to trying different brands so
you know that's just something to think
about with that but hopefully this video
is helpful if you like these kinds of
videos I know I do I can link my entire
subscription box playlist below please
subscribe if you enjoyed and I will
catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
