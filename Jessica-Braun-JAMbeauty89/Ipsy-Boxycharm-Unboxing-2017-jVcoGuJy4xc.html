going to share with you guys my Ipsy
versus Birchbox note note boxycharm no
Birchbox this month or if it's supposed
to come like I feel like I've been
waiting on it forever but these are from
January so it's a little late but I
wanted to share them with you because I
had a lot of you guys asking on snapchat
snapchat oh my on snapchat and Instagram
about whether or not I was going to do
them so I figured I would share for
those that want to see so let's our zip
see it is $10 a month the bag is kind of
cute this month it's like metallic kind
of a silvery blue and then there's like
a more pewter looking color underneath
kind of cute the first product is this
pur Lisse product and it is their blue
lotus seed mud mask and exfoliant so 10
minutes facial and it says that you well
it says the white clay tightens your
skin and purifies pores and that's what
I need right now
bamboo improves your skin texture ginger
detoxifies etc etc it goes on so you
have a cleanse face you put it on and
let it dry for 10 to 15 minutes and then
you remove it just like I did with
circular motions
I feel like this cold medicine is like
really getting brighten it up
alright the next product in here is this
Pacifica natural minerals blush if
that's cute coconut and rose infused
cheek color and they have a cute I see a
unicorn on the packaging I assume this
might be like a tester size because it
is smaller although it's not like tiny
so I could see it either way
it's a deeper mauve it's like a shimmer
to it you kind of see it there it's
really pretty though isn't it I mean I
would wear it I feel like it'd be really
pretty to put that on right now with my
finger now I gotta even it out I got a
pimple right there I know I mean it kind
of look like a clown no but it's really
I think it's a pretty color like you
could use it even if your as fair as me
so alright next thing in the bag so far
really good stuff this is a trust fund
Beauty lip gabem lip gloss the shade is
called method to the madness that's fun
see if I can get it open it's just a doe
foot applicator yeah it just looks like
a nice you know semi sheer peachy gloss
you know it doesn't seem to have a
single smell to it which is nice if
you're sensitive to smell because I know
a lot of the cloth has smelled that
bothers some people but you know just a
simple piece of cloth next thing I will
help Ryoji oh I've done a video with
them before it's the Rio Rose Arco
blow-dry perfection and heat protectant
cream this stuff I have a full-size and
I love it it is so good you know I blow
dry my hair every time I wash it whether
I'm wearing it like naturally wavy curly
or like today and it does such a great
job it's kind of lotion like and it does
a really good job of holding your hair
together so that it's not just every
single strand is dried out and frayed so
I do like this in the last product is
from the balm it's their Bahama Mama
bronzer it's tiny though you guys if you
watched my unboxing videos
I love the balm I really do they have so
many products actually what I'm wearing
on my eyes is one of their palettes it's
their the ball ma petite palette I love
it but when they put it sample this size
and here for a bronze or I'm like do
they just want us to swatch it and think
oh that's nice and then buy it because
if we're supposed to use it I mean I
can't use that for bronze they're my
brush we get like now it would take me
forever to get my brush coated enough to
appropriately apply this bronzer so I
just feel like that's kind of dumb and
they are notorious for this anyway but
other than that and it's a good product
it's a great bronzer I think if you have
my skin tone it's a little deep for it
but if you have deeper skin tone which
machines you guys do you would love it
but I feel like the the lip gloss was
seems nice the blush is really pretty
and I love the free ojio product and I
will definitely use this pur Lisse mask
so pretty good and I did really actually
like this makeup bag I'm probably going
to use it anyway purse this month next
up is boxycharm
and this one is more expensive it is $21
a month
so you expect to get more full-sized
kind of products in it considering
you're paying double what you pay for an
Ipsy bag so the first thing in here is
from pure and it's a full-size mineral
glow bronzing powder cosmetics they send
me a lot of their stuff I haven't tried
this but their products there I would
say it's kind of 50/50 for me half of
them I absolutely love they're
unbelievable and half of them I really
don't like they're just not right for my
skin or whatever but their bronzers that
I've tried I have loved so this one is
their mineral glow and it's in the shade
oh it doesn't there's no shame it's just
Niroula holy moley it is pigmented and
it's beautiful I feel like I could make
it work again I feel like most people
are deeper skin tone than I am I'm very
very fair so this would probably work
really really well for most of you guys
and it is so buttery oh my gosh
beautiful next product is ooh so it's
it's by Jessica lead skin and it's this
vintage line and I've gotten one of her
blush flash highlighters for me it
looked more like a blush or blush topper
but it was beautiful with one that I
didn't reach for because it was a lot
but I'm very curious because there's a
really good quality the packaging is
gorgeous and feels very high-end oh my
gosh so it looks like it's too like kind
of highlighting powders this says it's
rose quartz right here in chocolate
diamond here let's see oh my gosh it's
so beautiful oh my goodness that is like
un-freakin'-believable
how no one talking about this brand and
that literally the packaging feels very
very well made not like cheap plastic
but really nice kind of mattified heavy
plastic it's beautiful that is
definitely going to be tomorrow morning
when I get ready next thing is it's
called glow for a cause and it's their
body butter
says inspire so it smells very perfumey
not in a bad way but it I'm assuming
it's just a lotion like a body butter it
feels really really moisturizing and it
just smells really good that's what
really gets me but I like that I mean
that will definitely close to good use
oh I always forget they put the prices
sorry guys so the vintage highlighters
duo regular price $35 so right away
you've got way more than what you paid
for the proxy churn the pure bronzer is
$25 so again right away you get your
money's worth
this body butter is $14 let's keep going
so this brush it's a so Susan that's the
brand fan brush and it's 1895 this is so
funny because I have one fan brush and I
use it for highlight I used today but
I've been wanting one for blush because
I know can do an even better job of gosh
this feels really nice an even better
job of applying your your blush a little
bit more seamlessly and not so like
stripe like and so this feels really
very nice way better what brand do I
have right now it might be like morphe
or something it it's nice but it feels
nicer it's got a really nice purple with
gold but it feels very soft and very for
a fan brush very substantial so that is
amazing can't wait to use that lasting
get it open is it's a depth New York
nail treatment essential so this retails
for $18 and it's the full size it's
their ultra suede matte topcoat so you
can put this on top of nail polish to
get a matte finish to be honest with you
I'm not really a big fan of matte finish
nails although my nails are a mess right
now winter my two knuckles are crying
regardless this is a full-size if you do
like that you would love this it's
almost $120 probably closer to one
hundred and fifteen dollars worth of
products for $21 so as I say so many
months I love it see and I love
boxycharm
so fun to get and I get both of them for
free so I've got no skin in the game if
you will but I do feel like boxycharm
yes it's a little bit more expensive but
if you're really trying to get products
that you love and that you'll use I feel
like poxy turn to see I hope that this
is helpful if you love subscription box

years worth of all kinds of different
