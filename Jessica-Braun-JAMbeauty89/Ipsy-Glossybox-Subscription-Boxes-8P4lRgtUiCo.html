be unboxing two different subscription
boxes the Ipsy for this month and also
the GlossyBox I'm my boxy charm ship but
it's taking like 10,000 years so I'm
like you know what I'm just filming it
boxy charm if you decide to get here at
a decent hour I will film you separately
so because and that happens to me every
single month I feel like boxy charm I
always have to wait and then I've had my
Ipsy for like two weeks so by the time
boxing charm comes it's like the end of
the month and then I post it and it's
were already ready for the next month so
I'm like I'm sorry but I didn't do blah
see box last month this month i am so
all right anyway so let's go ahead and
get into it alright so let's start with
it see it is ten dollars a month the bag
is really really cute this month i think
that's a lot of fun it's like that
galactic outer space but it's like
stellar um let's go ahead and dig in oh
it looks like the theme is beauty blast
i see michelle phan and some other
beauty there i don't know her name say
the lees is her handle I said handle
again okay the first thing I'm seeing in
here is this hello gorgeous travel with
me travel blush makeup paper oh it's my
or makeit or says fifty percent off your
order I use code FC 2015 expires on
December 31st this year so it's kind of
this like kind of bronzy color and I
guess you just take the paper and place
it I don't know if all over use it to be
honest with you I'll try it but that's
not something that I'm i don't know i
should be big on that because I do
travel a lot but I don't know it just I
feel like I can't be prez precise as I
would want to be with it I guess is the
main thing the next thing is this beaut
a basics gel liner in Navy's let's see
comes with a little brush and really
loud rapper
feeling sassy today I think it's my
feather best just sassy so it's a true
like blue liner I don't know about where
it I'm just I really don't experiment
with my gel liner I did get a black gel
liner though from I'm assuming it was if
see it was make a beauty I don't know
what box it is in and I love it it's
almost gone that's what I'm wearing
today but it's wow they really seal this
puppy I mean this is taking me 10 years
to get there we go so it's a nice navy
blue a little bluer than Navy almost um
so I might keep it an experiment with it
because if it's a really good formula
then I could maybe order the black one
cuz once I run out of this other one I
do need to get a new gel liner anyway
stop my work itself out next thing oh
this is the Smashbox full exposure
mascara it's the deluxe size but still I
mean that's a really nice product to
come in a nip see this some people would
pay technologist for this anyway so to
get all the rest of it as well that is a
sweet sweet deal so this one if i
remember right i don't want to open it
but I'm gonna cuz I want to look at the
brush okay it's just kind of a bigger
thicker regular brush I know one of the
Smashbox ones has that like ball at the
end and I don't like it all but this one
I i don't remember i know i've tried it
but I'm gonna have to try it again next
thing is a color pop shadow what sheet
is this in now these are five dollars is
all right five dollars regular retail so
this is already half the cost of the bag
so that's pretty cool let's see it's in
the shade stereo and it's kind of like
this it's like brown and like purple all
mixed in with some gold I love the way
they feel Wow let me let me swatch that
better I did it like right on my knuckle
there it is there i mean there's
certainly pigmented no one could ever
dispute that they I always struggle with
how to wear these I a color like this I
would
we're like like I did today or maybe in
my crease but these aren't I mean they
blend okay but not as perfectly as I
like so I love these shadows but I
either use them as just a Lynch eight or
like to kind of line my eyes like smudgy
but other than that I really don't use
them that's my honest truth the last
thing in here is this cool way
stronghold spray they've had a lot of
cool whey products from them over the
years it looks like a hairspray oh it
smells really good here let's just try
some I've got all kinds of flyways it
really does smell nice I don't know um
I'll use this I can travel with this
which is great so all in all I mean for
these two alone it is definitely worth
the ten dollars the smash book Smashbox
mascara and the colour-pop shadow then
you just get the other stuff on top of
it all so I think that was pretty
awesome the bag is pretty cute too so go
if see this month that was one of the
better months for shift next thing when
we clean up mom mia next thing is lossy
box now this one's more expensive it's
21 dollars a month so you have to keep
that in mind I mean this is pricier so
typically there are more full sized
items I mean there better be because
it's double the price so let's go ahead
and a gig in the first thing in here is
this floor floor up II think exposed to
be like therapy boats flowers strengthen
energy mask it says aren't our nikah
rose experience ultimate hydration with
the restorative powers of flowers and
essential oils so it says our nikah I
hope I'm saying that right awakens and
revives the skin combats puffiness
promotes clean pores then the rose is
hydrating and it boosts the skin for
rapid replenishment so that yeah it's
just one mask I will definitely do that
like on a saturday night in a bubble
bath with a glass of wine or tea or both
I don't know done that before okay next
thing is this maersk mineral eyeshadow
to the little box I always like to rip
the packaging like I'm
ravenous okay so it looks like it's kind
of a shimmery bronze color let us see I
hate the mineral things cuz it's so hard
to like get it going I can't you guys
I've been times like two minutes I can't
get the thing off I'm just got to deal
with it later but it looks like a really
shimmery bronze II almost golden bronze
color like a lighter bronze which I
really like to put on my lids usually I
just used my finger I'll put like a
cream shadow and I'll use my finger with
the shimmery mineral shadow and it can
be really really pretty just on its own
so if you're wanting to be really quick
and get ready but still look like put
together and shimmery this is why I
don't know about this brand but that's
how I use mineral shows next thing ooh
crabtree &amp;amp; evelyn it looks like a yeah
it's a he and therapy hand cream I was
just looking and I've used a lot of my
hand creams up which is awesome because
I had way too many for a long time so I
finally used it up where I can actually
like actively go and look for some but
this one I will definitely I was wanting
to put one in my car that's awesome
let's see if it has like a smell or
anything Oh what I cannot open now it
has kind of a is that a floral I can't
decide that I don't think that's floral
it might be kind of smells florally to
me I might be wrong but that's what
smell like me so it's not my favorite
smell in the world is what I'm trying to
say but it's not bad and it feels really
creamy so i will definitely just use
that up especially in the winter this is
an estee lauder product this is their
revitalizing supreme global anti-aging
cream so looks like it's sis so this is
so nice it's got the little gold thing
so it's just like a face cream it
doesn't really have a smell which is
good my opinion says it's for all skin
types use am to pm and it's ideal after
a serum of course they named the repair
so you like the essay water serum but
but so you put this on just as your
night cream or day cream that's pretty
awesome and I will definitely use that
last thing in here is the beauty for
real define universal definition lip
pencil I always giggle when they say
it's a universal lip pencil like it can
be used with anything but then again
sometimes certain color is really candy
so it looks like it's a retractable one
yes it is oh it really does look pretty
universal oh I will use this so that's
the color right there that's a very that
really is universal it reminds me a lot
of well I mean it's clearly that like
Matt mauve color that everyone's all
about right now so but it really is
universal I mean you can even wear
something like this under a red lip just
to have a little definition because the
Reds gonna cover it but if you are
traveling and you only want to bring one
this would be a great shade so and it
feels really really creamy so that was
everything in both of those boxes if you
want to see more of my subscription box
videos I've been doing this for years
with lots of subscription boxes I will
link my entire playlist below I hope
that you'll subscribe and join our
little family here and I will catch you
