be unboxing two different subscription
boxes the emcee for this month and also
the glossy box I'm my boxycharm ship but
it's taking like 10,000 years so I'm
like you know what I'm just filming it
boxycharm if you decide to get here at a
decent hour I will film you separately
so because and that happens to me every
single month I feel like boxycharm I
always have to wait and then I've had my
hip C for like two weeks so by the time
boxycharm comes it's like the end of the
month and then I post it and it's we're
already ready for the next month so I'm
like when I say Charmy but I didn't do
GlossyBox last month this month BAM so
alright anyway so let's go ahead and get
into it
alright so let's start with the hip C it
is $10 a month the bag is really really
cute this month I think that's a lot of
fun it's like that
galactic outer space but it's like
stellar um let's go ahead and dig in oh
it looks like the theme is Beauty glass
I see michelle phan and some other
Beauty there I don't know her name say
the LEAs is her handle I said a handle
again okay the first thing I'm seeing in
here is this hello gorgeous travel with
me Travel blush makeup paper oh it's my
or makeit or says 50% off your order I
use code FC 2015 expires on December
31st this year so it's kind of this like
kind of bronzy color and I guess you
just take the paper and place it I don't
want to fall over use it to be honest
with you I'll try it but that's not
something that I'm I don't know I should
be big on that because I do travel a lot
but I don't know it just I feel like I
can't be precise as I would want to be
with it I guess is the main thing the
next thing is this beauty basics gel
liner in navies let's see comes with a
little brush and really loud wrapper
I'm feeling sassy today I think it's my
feather just a fee so it's a true like
blue liner I'm just I really don't
experiment with my gel liner I did get a
black gel liner though from I'm assuming
it was if see it was making beauty I
don't know what box it was in and I love
her it's almost gone that's what I'm
wearing today but it's wow they really
seal this puppy I mean this is taken me
ten years to get there we go so it's a
nice navy blue a little bluer than navy
almost so I might keep it an experiment
with it because if it's a really good
formula then I could maybe order the
black one cuz once I run out of this
other one I do need to get a new gel
liner anyway stop my work itself out
next thing oh this is the Smashbox full
exposure mascara
it's the deluxe eyes but still I mean
that's a really nice product to come in
a nip see this some people would pay
technologists for this anyway so to get
all the rest of it as well that is a
sweet sweet deal so this one if I
remember right I don't want to open it
but I'm gonna cuz I want to look at the
brush oh okay it's just kind of a bigger
thicker regular brush I know one of the
Smashbox ones has that like ball at the
end then I don't like it all but this
one I don't remember I know I've tried
it but I'm gonna have to try it again
next thing is a color pop shadow what
sheet is this in now these are five
dollars is alright five dollars regular
retail so this is already half the cost
of the bag so that's pretty cool let's
see it's in the shade stereo and it's
kind of like this it's like brown and
like purple all mixed in with some gold
I love the way they feel Wow
let me let me swatch that better I did
it like right on my knuckle there it is
there I mean there's certainly pigmented
no one could ever dispute that they I
always struggle with how to wear these
eye
like this I would typically wear like
like I did today or maybe in my crease
but these aren't I mean they blend okay
but not as perfectly as I'd like so I
love these shadows but I either use them
as just a lid shade or like to kind of
line my eyes like smudgy but other than
that I really don't use them that's my
honest truth the last thing in here is
this cool way stronghold spray they
we've got a lot of cool way products
from them over the years it looks it's
like a hair spray oh it smells really
good here let's just try some I've got
all kinds of flyways it really does
smell nice I don't know I'll use this I
can travel with this which is great so
all in all I mean for these two alone it
is definitely worth the $10 the smash
book Smashbox mascara and the color pop
shadow then you just get the other stuff
on top of it all so I think that was
pretty awesome and the bag is pretty
cute too so go it see this month that
was one of the better months for ship
next thing when we clean up mom me up
next week is glossy box now this one's
more expensive it's $21 a month so you
have to keep that in mind I mean this is
pricier so typically there are more
full-size items I mean there better be
because it's double the price so let's
go ahead and dig in the first thing in
here is this floor flora P thinking
supposed to be like therapy boats
flowers strengthen energy masks it says
aren't arnica Rose experience ultimate
hydration with the restorative powers of
flowers and essential oils so it says
arnica I hope I'm saying that right
awakens and revives the skin combats
puffiness promotes clean pores then the
rose is hydrating and it boosts the skin
for rapid replenishment so that I'm just
yeah it's just one mask I will
definitely do that like on a Saturday
night in a bubble bath with a glass of
wine or tea or both I don't know
done that before okay next thing is this
maersk mineral eyeshadow
a little box I always like to rip the
packaging like I'm ravenous okay so it
looks like it's kind of a shimmery
bronze color let us see I hate the
mineral things because it's so hard to
like get it going I can't you guys I've
been trying to like two minutes I can't
get the thing off I'm just going to deal
with it later but it looks like a really
shimmery bronze II almost golden bronze
color like a lighter bronze which I
really like to put on my lids usually I
just use my finger I'll put like a cream
shadow and I'll use my finger with the
shimmery mineral shadow and it can be
really really pretty just on its own so
if you're wanting to be really quick and
get ready but still look like put
together and shimmery this is why I
don't know about this brand but that's
how I use mineral shadows next thing ooh
Crabtree and Evelyn it looks like a yeah
it's a therapy hand cream I was just
looking and I've used a lot of my hand
creams up which is awesome because I had
way too many for a long time so I
finally used it up where I can actually
like actively go and look for some but
this one I will definitely I was wanting
to put one in my car that's awesome
let's see if it has like a smell or
anything
Wow what I cannot open it has kind of a
is that a floral I can't decide that I
don't think that's floral it might be
kind of smells florally to me I might be
wrong but that's what I like me um so
it's not my favorite smell in the world
is what I'm trying to say but it's not
bad and it feels really creamy so I will
definitely just use that up especially
in the winter this is a nest a Lauder
product this is their revitalizing
supreme global anti-aging cream so looks
like it's this is so this is so nice
it's got the little gold thing so it's
just like a face cream it doesn't really
have a smell which is good in my opinion
says it's for all skin types use am &amp;amp; PM
and it's ideal after a serum of course
they named the repair suit like the
Estee Lauder serum but but so you put
this on just as your night cream or day
cream that's pretty awesome and I will
we use that last thing in here is the
beauty for real define universal
definition lip pencil I always giggle
when they say it's a universal lip
pencil like it can be used with anything
but then again sometimes certain color
is really candy so it looks like it's a
retractable one yes it is oh it really
does look pretty universal oh I will use
this so that's the color right there
that's a very that really is universal
it reminds me a lot of well I mean it's
clearly that like matte mauve color that
everyone's all about right now so but it
really is universal I mean you can even
wear something like this under a red lip
just to have a little definition because
the Reds gonna cover it but if you are
traveling and you only want to bring one
this would be a great shade so and it
feels really really creamy so that was
everything in both of those boxes if you
want to see more of my subscription box
videos I've been doing this for years
with lots of subscription boxes I will
link my entire playlist below I hope
that you'll subscribe and join our
little family here and I will catch you
