my Ipsy on banging i would say unboxing
but it's really for this it's just not
but this is for january of 2016 let's go
ahead and get into it so i feel a little
weird today like I've got a stuffy nose
and I just feel weird so if I'm acting
weird well what else is new but I just
feel like not myself I don't know but
I'm not a bad mood I just I don't know
you know colds just like affect you in a
really bizarre way they just affect you
anyway so the theme is all eyes on you
it's kind of interesting it's got that
same kind of a theme but it has a plane
like royal blue background and like a
bright yellowish almost like chartreuse
zipper the first thing that was sticking
out of there was the skin iceland
glacial cleansing cloths and i actually
had this before i don't know if it came
in another ypsi or just another
subscription box but i like these i
think this yeah this was ten cloths
they're great for traveling come again
it would be maybe just enough for a week
it would mean it's a little more than
that but I also used it to wipe off
swatches on my hands and I remember
liking it there was nothing nothing that
stood out about this product that was
bad so but if they were really expensive
I don't know that they'd be worth paying
a ton of money for like a full size but
I remember waking up so i will
definitely use those another product in
here is from the ball and this is there
mr. right now eyeliner pencil in Jacques
j AC which looks like it's maybe yeah
it's kind of like a golden green like
you know what I mean that's the best way
I can think to describe it it's really
pretty this is a kind of color I've said
before that I would like to wear on my
lower lash line so I'm just because a
little lighter than black but it's not
for me necessarily something I've
on my upper lash line but I know a lot
of people do and it looks beautiful you
can kind of smudge it out all right next
thing it is a maersk and it apparently
Sydney and lemon it's a mineral
eyeshadow in the shade your toes if you
like I've gotten this as well but let's
see it so it's just you know a loose
mineral eyeshadow as I said and just a
really oh that is actually really pretty
just a pretty shimmery kind of bronzy
gold it really it's it's pretty it's one
that's it's almost a thin layer like I
feel like some blue shadows are so thick
and punchy that it's a lot when you
first put it on but this is just a
delicate amount so i think this is
something you could just put on just
kind of on a no-makeup makeup bday just
to add a little something without having
to worry about doing anything else it
just look really pretty in like a light
wash of color and it's a small size but
again with mineral eyeshadow what do I
mean again I haven't talked about it yet
but with mineral eye shadows I feel like
you don't go through them that quickly
so this isn't something I'm necessarily
going to run out of where I would need a
full size next thing in here is oh i
remember this brand this is the brand
hey honey and it's the open your eyes
eye contour lifting fluid that's all it
really says so i'm assuming this is
something you know just to kind of firm
your under-eye i'll use this the last
hey honey product we got was like a mask
that i don't remember if it was like a
peel i think it was like a honey peel
off mask and i did not like that i don't
know why i tried it a couple times and
every time i did i was like i don't like
this i'm more of a fan of like clay
masks and things like that but this i
will use i'm excited to try out and the
fifth item in here is from the brand
dirty little secret mm-hmm and it's in
the shade vengeance whatever it is I'm
assuming it's a yeah it's a lipstick it
looks like Justin simple really light
black packaging who kind of pinkish
purple it's pretty it's a it's a very
thin consistency which can be good and
bad good in that you know it's gonna
feel a lot more comfortable on your lips
but I want
show you okay that was a couple swipes
just look at one swipe it's really thin
but when you layer it like I did it
definitely adds some more pigment but
it's still really thin so for me with
thin consistencies like this my lips are
so pigmented that it almost doesn't work
I mean it'll still work I just have to
put a lot on but if you don't have very
pigmented lips it's not going to be a
problem for you I don't think so that's
kind of fun I've never heard of this
brand so I'm intrigued have you guys
heard of this brand have you tried meat
products let me know because I'm just
curious usually you know some of these
I've heard of at least from somewhere
but this is one I've never heard of so
those were all of the items that were in
the Ipsy bag for january i know i
usually do these together with the boxy
charm like i do an Ipsy and boxy charm
unboxing but they come like weeks apart
so I figure you know what I'm just gonna
do them what I get them so I've already
done my boxy charm for this month of
your interest i will like it both up
there but also down below and i can also
link my subscription box why am I
putting this back in there I can also
link my subscription box unboxing entire
playlist that i have if you're
interested in watching that hopefully
you'll subscribe to catch more videos
that I'll see you guys in my next one
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
