an Ipsy and a Birchbox to open for you
guys um I was incredibly impressed with
one of them and incredibly disappointed
with one and I have cancelled one of
them and I'm sure by the end of this
video you will know exactly which one
that I cancelled so we'll start with
Birchbox both of these boxes if you
don't know our ten dollars a month and
Birchbox usually comes in a box like
this okay
this is the one that I cancelled I gave
you and I keep it a secret I cancelled
Birchbox this month this was the biggest
bummer and last month I wasn't impressed
either and if you remember if you saw my
latest Birchbox video which really I
just films recently I was saying that I
had cancelled it for a long time because
I kept being disappointed and yet again
I'm disappointed so it's got the info
the theme is step-and-repeat
o award season so let's go through what
they sent shall we first of all they
sent these effervescent breath treatment
sand I think these are the lifestyle
extra there's peppermint and honey mint
yeah so I guess you can just put it in
your mouth until they begin to pop okay
I just want to try one of these let's
try the peppermint I just got to know
I'm assuming these are like pop rocks
cuz it says wait till they pop okay can
you guys hear that
in it bobbin
really oh no well I mean they taste like
peppermint I wonder how long this lasts
I only took like half of it took like
it's medicine so I mean that's kind of
fun that is kind of a cool idea when if
you get like a whole vial of it if I
keep okay by the way I'm filming with my
new camera so if I keep looking insides
because I'm not used to having the
capability to look at what I'm filming I
used to yeah usually I'd like a mirror
right behind so so now it's to the side
so I'm just adjusting just stick with me
you guys okay so the next thing Birchbox
sent was this one I don't even know what
this is Beauty protector it's a hair
product let's see protect an oil it's a
just for you hair oil it defends against
UV rays heat and breakage so you can put
it in damp or dry hair so it's just a
hair oil I'm sure I'll give this a shot
and see how I like it you know it and
this is always great for travel if you
want to bring some sort of oil with you
you know it's real small it's like class
though I think it's nice ok the next
thing they sent was this pores no more
pore refiner it's dr. Brandt I wonder if
this will focus there we go so I'm
assuming this is a kind of a primer a
pore refiner and it's point it's in this
huge thing but it's like well huge
bigger than it should be because it's
only 0.25 ounces so we'll see but I do
like trying for it finders and actually
if I don't like it my mom was wanting
another one so I might get her and then
they also sent another Ruby wing now you
know if you watch my last one that I was
excited about the Ruby wing polish that
they sent because it was color changing
and I is that it so do they all to all
of the Ruby wing polishes change color
because this one does twosome is that
like all they do or do they have regular
polishes to what is in my eyelash
there's like a glitter or not looks like
all I see that would be fun all you see
is glitter anyway so this one's in the
shade
mini kitten heels
so it's supposedly the two different
shades there I don't know we'll see okay
so the next thing they said
that was a perfume sample that just
makes me mad I can get these for free I
can get like a handful for free from
Sephora at any given time just for
ordering something so when I get
something like this like come on but I
don't know if this is a new scent which
is always nice you know it's Couture la
la which is of course from Juicy Couture
and it's Malibu I'm just gonna spray it
let's see what happens actually it
smells really good
I think we'll see how it wears on me and
mixes with my own body chemistry but so
I just want to sing and that's it so I
got the nail polish to Harold well you
know now that I go back through it it's
not that bad I think it's better than
last month's was I guess it's not that
bad but I don't know it's just the
perfume sample really kind of made me
mad and then the breath treatments you
know that's actually is kind of fun so I
don't know what I'm complaining about
but when you see what I got in the Ipsy
bag you'll be like okay if you're
spending $10 your merch box or $10 an
Ipsy you would go with Ipsy anytime
especially this month so just get ready
now there are two extras that I was sent
which I love I just dropped more of
course I'll show you the extras at the
end because they are awesome and you get
them when you refer friends or when you
review the products on the Ipsy site you
get points and you can trade this points
in for these extra items and oh my gosh
when I show them to you you'll be like
what and that was my reaction to and
they were full size and I was like Oh am
I getting this for free like it was
crazy
so this month bad was this one now this
feels it's funny I feel like each month
it's hit or miss with the quality of the
bag this one feels a lot more well-made
than the past few have been so I was
really impressed it's cute pink and
white of course the theme was
Valentine's Day they called it the look
of love and these are all kind of
products that you could use on
Valentine's Day or well of course any
time I was so impressed so I'll start
with one this is the moist and firm BB
doesn't say BB cream just BB
brightening and wrinkle care and I guess
the brand is ipk in New York oh yeah so
it's an O to light for all skin types
let's see here it's one of those things
where it's like barely full whoa oops
I hear you phone I hear ya whoa that's
gonna be way too dark
look my gosh look at that that's way too
dark
this is comical to clown paint and even
I don't have anything to wear my
swatches off what else is new every
single time hold on well hello all right
hold on
I better edit all of this out okay so
the BB cream way too dark that kind of
stinks and by kind of I mean oh well
I'll give it to someone tanner than me
all right so the next thing they sent
was this full-size Soviet polish and
they're always really good this sure
keeps like going down trying to show
stuff full-size oil polish this is the
second full-size Oh a polish I've gotten
from them and it that I love that
because these are freaking expensive and
this is in the shade dot and it's just a
beautiful light pink color I think it's
beautiful isn't that pretty
and so I'm really excited to use that I
wish I would have used it for
Valentine's Day but I put this nail
cause by the way is the selling hint you
know what I have no idea hold on this
all right so it's in the shade this is
selling it's an it's a dry and pumped up
pink which I mean this is such a
beautiful nail polish I think it's got
like all those flecks of things and I
just like it my nails are chipped but I
really really do like this it's one of
my favorites okay so it also came with
these are all full-size that's what I
love about it see they're not even
messing around they're all full-size so
this is a cream shadow the brand is I
better you'll see they don't have the
breakdown in this one or maybe they do
and I just have
I don't know but this is a cream shadow
from the brand I guess it's the brand
the idées group
that's what it says but it literally
does not have a brand name oh but it has
the little martini glass if you've ever
seen that I don't know what brand that
is but I feel like I've seen that before
but anyway it's a green shadow and this
is a really pretty color
it's like a bronzy topi isn't that
pretty
oh yeah so I'm really excited to give
this one a try now I usually don't wear
darker colors like on my lid focus on me
whoa
so I'll have to use it in the crease and
blend it out but it looks gorgeous so
I'm just excited about that if you like
this video is an absolute mess just okay
I'm so excited all this stuff they also
sent a pop beauty lip gloss and peony
petal first of all this packaging is
adorable
is it not adorable it is and this the
black part feels like the NARS packaging
like that matte really soft you know
what I mean and this color is gorgeous
oh it's like a nice a little bit deeper
color that you could still wear during
the daytime it's just so beautiful they
also sent a freaking humungous blush
it's from the brand city color and it's
their beam matte blush in the shade
fresh melon look at how freakin
humongous this is it's shoujo and bob am
look at that color
okay let's get a swatch going look at
that oh you got me I'm spilling water
I'm making a mess so I was really
excited about that
I I mean oh my gosh you could use this
for two years and never run out of it
it's huge and humongous so by the way
the inside of the makeup bag has cute
little who let me pack all these things
back up so here's the kicker
so for ten dollars I just got a million
things and then like I said so basically
if you refer a friend forever
for friends that you refer you get you
can get what is it like a thousand
points because it's 250 points per
friend you refer and for a thousand
points you can get any other extra items
they're offering that month and it
changes not as often as I wish and
there's usually only two or three things
you can get and once you get one you
can't get that same item again
I wish because once the Beautyblender is
on there and I got a Beauty Blender and
I was like I will change all my points
for a million Beauty blenders because I
love Beauty blenders and they're so
expensive anyway so one of the things
was this kiss salon secrets nail art
stencil kit and you know I don't know I
wasn't gonna get it and then I decided
I'll just get it because whatever I mean
if there's like a dotting tool on things
that I could totally use so I liked that
but it also came with a freaking
full-size benefit high beam are you
joking me are you joking me when I
clicked and said yeah I'll redeem them
for that I figured it'd be like a little
trial no no no it's straight-up
full-sized and if you don't know what
this is it's like an setup like a nail
polish but it's like a highlighting
liquid and it's right there if you can
see that and it's just beautiful it's so
beautiful right under your brow bone or
especially on your cheek bones it blends
up to a really nice finish I don't even
know if I can get it to do it any
justice but it's so beautiful and I've
always wanted it and I've never even
gotten a sample size a lot of times you
can get sample I know I'm like not
looking at the camera at all I'm trying
to adjust this is really awesome and
really difficult anyway so I was losing
my mind ever getting a full sized
benefit product for free so all of that
was part of the Ipsy of course these two
weren't part of the original bag they
were reward things but still they're
treating their customers right Birchbox
you need to get it together I love you
but I mean I mean Ryan can if see send
all these full-size ones and Birchbox
not and I don't know maybe I'll keep the
Birchbox I don't know because I don't
want to every time I cancel it the next
month it's like awesome and I'm like man
and I
going again and then next month that I
joined it's crappy again I'm like why
anyway so that was my Ipsy versus
Birchbox
if see takes the cake as usual and if
you would like I guess I could keep the
Birchbox
I just hate spending ten dollars a month
when I end up being disappointed every
time I'd rather spend it on hypsi any
day by the way I have a boxycharm
unboxing coming up and I'm really
excited because boxycharm I always
impresses me too and it's a little more
expensive but I have been loving it so
much it's so sorry I just got excited
because I know what's in it and it's
pretty awesome so anyway so I hope that
video a little my swatches are making a
mess I hope that video was helpful for
you guys if you're interested in either
one of them of course there are always
links below for all this stuff you know
that and I'm blabbering again at the end
of the video what else is new again if
you're still watching you must really
like me anyway I'll catch you guys very
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
