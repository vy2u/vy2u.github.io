have an Ipsy versus boxycharm video for
you guys and if you're new to my channel
or you've never seen me do these videos
before basically I compare my Ipsy bag
which is ten dollars a month with the
boxycharm box which is twenty one
dollars a month now mci purchase on my
own I pay for it myself
boxycharm they send to me each month you
guys know me especially if you have been
watching me for a while I always give it
to you straight and tell you whether
it's good or not whether I'm paying for
the item or not so that being said let's
start with the Ipsy now when you refer
friends through if sees kind of like
referral program you get MC points which
are no good until they have items up
there that you can redeem them for and I
think you have to refer essentially for
friends to be able to get one of their
free items with your FC points however
it's it seems that it's really rare that
they actually put new things up there so
it's a weight like I've literally waited
like two months before for a new item to
come up and find them like okay and it's
usually sometimes it's something I want
sometimes it's not but there's really
like nothing to choose from so that's
the one kind of downer with their
referral program however they finally
had some new things up so I was like yes
finally thank you so some of the three
things I got with my FC points was this
Teodoro drench yourself in sensory
beauty it's their rainforest at dawn
nourishing shampoo and conditioner and
their just trial size whoops
they're just try outside ones and you
know I was kind of hoping with those
points sometimes you get like I've
gotten a full-size bareMinerals lipstick
for free through that for the same
amount of points as I got these but I
also got the rainforest at dusk ones
their shampoo and conditioner so yes
I'll probably use these when I travel
but maybe not I don't know we'll see so
those are free with that and then also I
got the these nail decals they're like
little stickers if you will there's some
arrows just cute little patterns they
were one of the ones for that too and I
just figured I would do it since it
seems that it takes them forever to get
new ones
and then I also got this cream shadow I
think it's from that be a bombshell
cosmetics I think it never says and it's
in ambrosia and it looks like it's
this kind of a doe foot wand applicator
and it's just this nice kind of bronzy
brown color however I don't know other
than just watching it just now that I'll
ever wear this so I might you know what
I'm I was gonna say I might give it to a
sister but I okay I just found this
website called Edith and I heard of it
from someone else here on YouTube and I
was like what is this cuz sometimes like
you hear about all these things you kind
of roll your eyes cuz it's just like
yeah it's just another site where
there's you know a bunch of youtubers
are going crazy however I was really
excited because when I found out it was
based its basically trading or swapping
of makeup and I used to use this one
website called makeup alley and I ended
up getting screwed over by a few people
that didn't end up sending the thing and
it was just a really crummy deal and the
site I still go there from time to time
because there's reviews and stuff but I
just had a bad taste in my mouth with
makeup swapping sites but then II did it
just seems way more legitimate and I
haven't like set up my shop yet if you
will but I have like created my account
so I can put my link below because by
the time you're watching this I might
have added some things but I'm planning
on doing that because you know in all
these subscription boxes and you guys
probably do too if you get hypsi bags or
brought to charm Starbucks whatever you
always end up having like one or two
items that you're like I'm never going
to use this or you know it's just not
your taste see that's a place you can
put it and then you can hopefully trade
with someone else that they might want
that and you might have something in
yours you might they might have
something in their shop that you want
you could just swap and you're not
having to worry about money or anything
like that and it's trustworthy so I
think if something happens you know that
the e div will help you resolve the
issue whereas on makeup alley it's like
buyer and seller beware it's real
sketchy so I love the idea of that
anyway so I think like this I would
probably list on there I might even list
these since I don't know I have so many
travel shampoo and conditioners anyway
okay the next thing I got for free with
Ipsy is this well I think it's be a
bombshell as well and it's in the shade
plum wine and it's one of their
lipsticks okay this actually might be
gorgeous in the fall it's like this semi
sheer plum color and it's just really
nice it's not cut it's not too crazy
it's just
a really nice plum color oh this is
gonna be awesome in the fall I'll
probably be keeping that one so those
are the extra items now on to the actual
Etsy bag I'm looking at it right now and
I don't know it's it's cute I like the
orange and the white but I tell you
every month sometimes it's a crappy bag
and sometimes it's good this one feels
kind of crummy and not as well made
which you know for ten bucks you're
getting makeup anyway oh well but not a
big fan so the first thing I'm seeing is
this body cream this body cream I don't
know the brand is does it have like a
card oh they never write their brands
those forget the theme by the way is
Beauty schooled cute it looks like Eve
Eve okay no but it spelled like vul it
doesn't matter um I don't know
is it a bot it's like a lotion it
doesn't smell terrible but it doesn't
smell great it says it's got Sicilian
lemons and minerals it definitely has a
little lemony scent again this might be
a nice one to throw in my bag just to
have some sort of nice hand cream I want
to feel what it feels like it feels it
certainly smells clean you know so if
you uh thinking I dip my finger in it
there too it smells clean and I don't
mind the scent of lemons but I think if
you don't like lemons you probably
wouldn't like it I guess love with make
sense right okay the next thing this was
an in the bag
ooh it's Urban Decay perversion tell me
it's the liner
oh it's mascara well okay so it looks
like it's if I can get it out of the
little thing it's one of their mascaras
come on in perversion if you don't know
Urban Decay's liner in perversion is
like their blackest black liner I don't
want to open it yet to see it only
because I don't want to get it all dried
out and I might it might be a while
before I actually try this so but it's
got really nice packaging and I I mean
it'll probably be great I can't say that
I tried an urban decay product that I
did love so and you know they're
expensive okay moving on they also sent
this
mana beauty simplified its their sheer
glow shimmer lotion and it looks like
it's kind of a creamy I want to say it
creamy highlight just because even
though it's a pinkish shade it is really
really shimmery but it doesn't really
have a smell
Oh what kind of blend is completely out
so maybe it is kind of like a shimmer
highlight but I mean I don't really see
any shimmer
I mean if it's this is like a really
kind of low-key hi I really don't see
any shimmer to be completely honest it
feels nice and maybe that's the key
maybe you can put it on and it's really
like it's barely there but it's just
that little added touch so that actually
might be really nice you guys know me I
usually do natural looks so I would
probably really like that the next thing
be all natural organic lip balm and
grapefruit well I certainly use lip balm
every day as beeswax coconut oil cocoa
butter jojoba oil lots of oils don't
look like there's anything bad in it
which is nice there's no SPF which is
kind of nice also because sometimes when
you're not out and about
SPF drives my lips out so if I'm not out
in the Sun I don't necessarily want to
put it all over my lips because it dries
them out so quickly it really stinks
okay the last thing in here is this
Coastal Scents Forever blush sample
really Coastal Scents so you couldn't
give us a full one okay it's got two
different shades it looks own this one
so peachy it could almost be a bronzer
I'm sure it'll be pigmented and let me
try it
but I mean Coastal Scents is so
inexpensive as it is I'm surprised it
wasn't just a full size yeah there they
are pigmented that's for sure I mean
they're pretty but how am I gonna get a
blush brush in there someone riddle me
that I don't own a brush that's gonna
fit in there unless it's an eyeshadow
brush and then I'm like painting my face
like it's a paint brush okay this okay
well first of all it says you can get
25% off with the code blush 25 off at
checkout I'll put that below if I
remember - okay I gotta admit that was
the worst Sipsey bag I've ever gotten
the okay lip balm great this may be
blush trial no the lotion mmm it's just
a process and that was it o-o that's
right in the urban decay okay that one
was pretty good
I love getting urban decay things in
there and I got one of their new liners
before and I loved that I used the heck
out of that it's already gone I could
have done without all of this and then
the bag was kind of crummy too so for me
that was a total loss of ten dollars
that's always a bummer but oh well last
month's was last month's really good I
feel like I wasn't that great either but
usually they're my favorite I mean if C
is usually the bomb so not gonna cancer
or anything because a I just love it see
I love in the end that it always ends up
being worth it but this month was maybe
the worst okay moving on to boxycharm
let's just see cuz I think last month's
boxycharm sucks too remember last month
was kind of a wonk month you guys
remember that all right so it says hello
gorgeous
thanks it says we've included a bonus
item just for you I wonder if they'd do
that for everyone or if it's just
because I'm a youtuber and they know it
that's one thing I always think about
like okay that's nice but if they're not
doing that for everyone it's not I don't
know it's not indicative necessarily for
company if they're just doing it for me
does that make sense so I don't know I'm
curious if you got boxycharm this month
if you also got to go inside them or not
let me know down below cuz all right
Beach babe is though I don't want to
look at the stuff but beach babe is the
theme for the note to me it feels the
summer's over but whatever whoa okay all
this stuff looks amazing holy crapoly
grab over here oh holy crap okay the
first thing is in this I can't I get up
stop looking because I am so excited
about the things I just saw in this box
I'm gonna start with this stuff okay
it's just silver something full-size
okay Ofra is the brand or Oprah
americano bronzer it doesn't have a
shade name I'm assuming a mere whoa well
it is dark however you know you could
use it I mean it's oh it's really really
really really like silky smooth
I wish you could feel it that might be
the smoothest bronzer I've ever felt but
it's certainly got an orange tint to it
that might show up on my Edith account
because it's awesome it's full size it
seems well made it's incredibly silky
smooth but no way with my skin tone
there is literally no way that's gonna
work even lightly for me now someone
else that's gonna look absolutely
gorgeous on and it's got a little bit of
a shimmer to it
wow that's pretty but that sucks shade
wise okay this is a brush it's the brand
more with an e at the end
whoa it looks like a powder brush or
something it's really really big which I
love I wanna see what the light price on
this was and the price and the other
that bronzer by the way whoa $35 Wow
okay this the morphe brushes powder
brush this is this is a powder brush is
$19.99 it does feel really well made I
have to admit I'm excited however no I
probably will use it for powder because
I love my Real Techniques ones but
sometimes when I'm just trying to get in
a specific area with my powder I want
something a little smaller and this is
still big but it's just a little bit
smaller than that so this actually might
be perfect to have and it does feel
really really well made the ferrule
feels like heavy you know so that is
awesome
alright what's next there is the terena
Tarantino you guys know how much I love
that brand and they're always on
HauteLook for crazy cheap and their
shows are amazing their blushes are
amazing so buddy do I own any no I don't
think I don't any of their lip products
first of all look at the packaging it's
this adorable like kind of steel grey if
that's the right description it's really
heavy it's at these cute little
rhinestones or whatever you want to call
it it's so heavy I wish you guys could
feel oh my gosh okay ah look at the
color it's like this beautiful beautiful
baby pink but it's a little bit more
muted than typical blue and it's just a
little bit more sheer than you would
think which I like and it was called
they
conditioning lip Sheen's so it's a
little more I think moisturizing than a
typical lipstick would be oh my gosh oh
my gosh this is so freaking perfect for
work how much is this this is $22
originally yeah I'd pay that for it I
wish you guys could feel the packaging
it is so amazing and it just feels so
moisturizing in that color is perfect
for everyday that alone would be worth
it oh my gosh okay next thing I'm trying
to make sure I'm trying to figure out
which one is the extra item okay okay
the Model Co chicken lips or cheat yeah
chicken lips
cheek and lip tint and rosy red red
we'll see oh it's it reminds me of like
I'm you know OCC lip tar packaging but a
little bit bigger so let's see I'm so
curious okay
well it comes out darkest night let's
just see what happens whoa okay so it
blends I need to wipe swatches off I
mean I might be a little scared to put
that on my cheeks at first I what I
might do is do something like rub it out
a little bit here and then get a stipple
brush on there and stipple it on
I wouldn't apply this directly my cheeks
assuming this does stain because if you
get too much in one area it'll be
stained way darker in certain areas than
others so I would say rub a little bit
on your hands stipple your brush into it
then stippling on your cheek so you have
a more even application my hand looks
insane but interesting I'm glad it does
um kind of tone itself down there
because at first I mean that was darkest
night you guys saw that that's fun I
don't own anything like that so I'm
actually kind of excited to give that a
try anyway if it stays on all day that
would be amazing
okay let's see the next thing okay this
is the one that's actually included is
this Ofra or Ofra eyeliner and it's in
the shade turquoise and it looks like
yeah it's just this really nice shimmery
true turquoise color it's really smooth
and I've never tried any of the opera
eyeliner so I don't know how it's where
time will be I'll have to let you guys
know but yeah I like the shade that's a
color I would wear on my lower lash line
right now I'm wearing actually a similar
color you might not be able to see it up
close but or see it from here but it's a
similar color to this so I do like
colors that I like that on my lower lash
line so now this must be the extra thing
because it's not on the list
oh and by the way that lip and cheek
tint from model Co was $22 and then this
liner is $13 so I mean that was how much
money thirty five twenty-two twenty-two
that is literally over a hundred dollars
of full-size products and you pay twenty
one dollars a month that's worth it that
is worth it I mean it's kind of insane
and I actually like every single thing
in there for once and last one's body
charm was anyway okay this is the extra
item they sent it's the Tarte cheek
stain in fearless now this is a full
size and they I've gotten I think two
months ago they sent the tarte cheap
tarte cheap i cannot say that it's
hearts cheek stain it was in a different
shade i think it was in blushing bride
or no Bridal Beauty something like that
a couple months ago and it just came
regular in the boxycharm for everyone
and it was so amazing cuz tart is so
expensive so it screws up like this and
that woo oh I like this so much better
than the other shade that's so cute I
love that color it's just such a nice
wearable color for year-round I like
that a lot better the other one was just
a little bit darker and I still like it
I still got it but it just for me this
makes way more sense so I'm really
really excited but again let me know if
you guys got this as well or if you got
any bonus items because I'm curious to
know if they just did that for everyone
or how that works or I don't know I'm
just curious so wow this month I gotta
give it to boxycharm
but last month I think I would have said
it if she could win but they were both
terrible and I wonder what I chose the
month before that I think it was a tie
half the time is it time because they're
both amazing but again you got to be
conscious of your budget if you know
that 21 dollars is not gonna happen each
month on makeup
don't do it do the Ipsy if you know $10
is way more in your range then do it but
if you know you have the extra money or
maybe you have two different $10 ones
and you're like you know what I'd rather
get a bunch of full-size products then I
have a say boxycharm is the way to go
because it's always all full-size and
it's pretty much always amazing this
month was certainly amazing
so definitely checked out the output
links below for all this stuff if you're
interested that my eat if link will be
down below too although like I said I
don't know if I'll have anything up yet
or not but hopefully I will either way
you can check it out
and that is all I guess I'll catch you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
