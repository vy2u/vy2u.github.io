Ipsy vs birchbox for May so I'm very
excited because I literally love it see
so much and I literally love boxy charm
so much so these videos are way more fun
for me than the Ipsy versus birch boxes
like back when I used to do it seemed
birchbox because I was always so
disappointed with birchbox I was like it
was always like a clear winner but these
are way tougher because I love them both
so much I'm always happy so here we go
let's go ahead and start with the Ipsy
one if see if you don't know it's ten
dollars a month so okay this is adorable
this is the bag it came in this might be
my favorite this is that one that was
purple and it had like the collegiate
little like scholarly symbols on it that
was really cute I loved that one I still
have that one I just love it this might
be a close runner up it's kind of a
canvas feel to it and of course it's got
little this is adorable like I've said
before if she always has like some
months the bags are kind of crap willie
Mae and then there's other months for
the bags are like really well-made like
this one so this is a really well made
month you jackpot ok here is the card
the theme is fresh pics so it seems
certainly kind of springy yay all right
the first thing I see it's the hang ten
fifty classic sport sunscreen um
certainly crazy fun packaging perfect
size to throw in a beach bag I love that
it's SPF of 50 I wonder if it's supposed
it says it's non-greasy so I wonder if
you could use it kind of on your face or
not I mean can use anything on your face
but is it kind of safe for your face you
guys know what I mean I like that it's
not greasy but it doesn't really say
necessarily for face so I guess it says
it's water-resistant for 80 minutes I
think this is just so perfect for a
beach bag and it's just so fun it makes
me think of the early 90s like saved by
the bell when they were on the beach and
they were all wearing like crazy neon
colors like this love it you know what I
mean give this video a thumbs up because
I'm curious who else watches I still
watch day by the Bell I rent it
from the library for free you can rent
so many DVDs with libraries so i get
like seasons of shows like that from the
90s and boy meets world and all of those
classics and i watch them all the time
anyway okay the next thing Ava or Eva
NYC therapy session hair mask again
really cute packaging oh it's like neon
City up and heal it says it's got argan
oil oh yeah you guys know I like argan
oil deeply conditioned so it really is a
hare mas but do you leave it in or do
you rinse it out let's see you can use
it as a weekly treatment or an everyday
conditioner okay apply generously weight
to 25 minutes and rinse so yes and in
the shower mask this is cute next thing
I see what Oh thermal a vain I'm not
sure mispronouncing all the thermal
spring water for sensitive skin what
what do you spray it is it like a
refreshing mist well I don't know and it
does everything's like covered in the
back I'm assuming this is just like a
refreshing mist which really is nice I
tend to use these more less in the
summer and more like the winter when I'm
stri and bland you know and super pale
white usual but what else is new next
thing I see is this Pacifica shadow duo
it literally said it's a specific and
natural beauty duo number one they're
pretty color is certainly useful but boy
do I have enough shadow to last me for a
lifetime you guys know that um the too
faced chocolate soleil ok I think I have
an idea I already own this and I know a
lot of you guys are wanting to try this
I think I am gonna give away all the
products in this lipsy bag because
really I don't need any of these I've
got plenty of hair mask so all five I
might keep the bag though cuz that now
that I think is that selfish I'll throw
in a different makeup bag I'll go out
and actually buy a makeup bag for this
giveaway because i really like i now
have like an empty bag collection so
it's a little different i have like each
month anyway but i'm going to give away
all five of these products if you are
wanting to
enter let's see the rules for entering
will just be down below so definitely
check it out you can win all this
including this little chocolate Soleil
and I'll probably throw in a few other
things just in the giveaway because I've
got plenty of makeup that's unopen so if
you would like to enter check down below
yay random given where's okay so one of
the treats of ypsi is their referral
program so when you refer friends and
when you review products you get points
and you can redeem them they only
usually only have a couple items up at a
time and I feel like I'm always waiting
like what are they gonna put a new item
up but you can redeem them on that this
was a full-sized bareminerals lipstick
and it's in the shade light it up full
size full size for free so the packaging
looks like this you push open this
button or no how do you do it oh yeah
you kind of glue and then that is the
shade that's gorgeous that is such a fun
like firecracker coral color that's
going to be really fun in this summer
and this packaging is just really heavy
I mean it's an expensive lipstick so you
know I guess I shouldn't be surprised
it's really nice packaging but I have a
trial size of the bare minerals but was
in a different shade and i love the
formula you can just tell it's really
like pigmented and just kind of creamy
so yay so that was an exciting one that
i got like as a perk now onto the boxy
charm they have changed their box they
used to put it like in a separate box
with a thing but i think now that
they've gotten bigger i'm assuming this
is a little easier for them which I
don't blame still cute can't blame them
all right mother's day is the theme
that's so cute all right um yeah looks
like there's five Prabhu whoa so the
first thing right on top is this novex
looks like hair oil creep it's on a
different extra deep hair care cream
both of them are hair care creams so
sorry this packaging is terrible for
lighting purposes but one is olive oil
and the others argan oil so that's kind
of fun way I have a lot of hair oils
this is gonna be thrown into the
giveaway to
all right another thing this kabuki
brush let's see it's the Pharaoh
cosmetics and it's runs for twenty
dollars she's leaves oh how much of
those Novak's things run for oh those
are just samples so I don't know it
doesn't say it's just a sample okay so
this is a kabuki brush right it's pink
you guys know that's my favorite color
it's really soft that is really cute ah
that's funny alright so that's adorable
I like the pink I might let this replace
my elf one I don't really use kabuki
brushes all that often though so it's
not know the next thing ooh mirabella's
is a lip yeah lip color it's a
full-sized this runs for $22 for this
size chase please who is paying that
it's in the shade heat I see on the side
so really heavy duty kind of packaging
pretty silver whoa let's compare it with
this one so this is a much deeper more
red tone than the other one clearly but
this is really nice $22 for this
lipstick so really nice lip colors I
have snagged these are nail polish
removers little pads let's see how much
does this runs for fifteen dollars the
brand is Lauren B's that what that says
yeah it's got 15 of them and it says
it's spring blossom scented little nail
polish path that's nice kid I'm almost
out of the little ones I don't even know
what brand I have now but these really
are awesome for travel if you know
you're going to be gone a while and you
might want to repaint your nails or
remove it you know whatever you might do
these are perfect you don't want to be
lugging around nail polish remover
liquid that's an extra liquid you don't
have to have okay the last thing is big
it says desert tulip lavish hand cream
okay this box is adorable are you
kidding me since it's got red tulips
white tea rose and lilies this is
adorable certainly a full-size what does
this run for this is oh the brand is it
Lou you can't ride their candles before
twenty dollars and it's fine no 3.5
ounces let's smell this sucker Oh
I put out way too much that smells nice
it not know it does smell nice the more
you rub it in at first it's like whoa
like perfume me and kind of a flowery
floor away but it's nice once you rub it
out it's got a nice like soft scent to
it okay okay so i would say in both
cases not my favorite month for either
box both of them are great and i liked
it like boxy charm everything we got
this time none of it was like i don't
think any of it was making except for
the lipstick so it was all kind of
different stuff like lotion and the
kabuki brush and nail plush and i like
that like if every month was always make
up kind of overwhelming so I like fit
boxy charm kind of shook it up and gave
you things that you don't normally get
which I love and like I said boxy charm
yes it's more expensive but you get all
full-size things where a tipsy usually
it's sample sizes however not always a
nipsey's case and of course if c is
cheaper so it's one of those things you
gotta look at your own budget and see
all right what would be what would make
fiscal sense for you but if you're
wanting more high-end products and more
full size than i would go with box of
charm it's worth the money so in the
giveaway it's all those items that were
in the Ipsy bag and the Novack's things
here and i'm going to throw in just some
other surprises into it anyway alright
so I hope that was helpful for you guys
in making your decision with your
subscription boxes let me know if you're
subscribed to a box that I've never
talked about because I'm always curious
about new ones and I will catch you guys
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
