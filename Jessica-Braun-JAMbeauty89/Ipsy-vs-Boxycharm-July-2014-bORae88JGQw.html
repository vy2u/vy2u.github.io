film and I'm filming every month and
it's my FC versus boxycharm video and I
love it because I end up always loving
both of them so I'm really excited to
see what it is this month so we'll start
with hip C and classic pink bag the bag
is pink I saw it peeking out of there
which pink is my favorite color however
it feels like you know I always talk
about how like some months the bags are
really well made in some once they're
not well last month it was really well
made this month it's not it just kind of
feels like it's like a like a pleather
or I don't know I'm not good with
materials but some sort of like fake
pleather II feeling bag and I like that
the edges are scallops but it just kind
of feels like I don't know coming mm-hmm
so anyway okay let's dig in I'm very
excited we make sure there's nothing
else okay okay wait here's the theme
card it's a sensationally Sunkist mm-hmm
okay let's see the first thing I grabbed
was a bare minerals 5 in 1 BB advanced
performance cream eye shadow I'm gonna
rip it open
oh jeez so it looks like a kind of a
taupe brown color and like this little
tiny tube and okay it's got a little doe
foot applicator it's a nice brown and it
blends kind of well kind of blend it out
there which is you know probably a good
thing especially for me with a darker
color like that I'm not gonna want I'm
gonna want this to be more of a wash of
a color not like a highly pigmented
concentrated dark brown at least for me
other people would so regardless so
interesting alright
oh there's a car up bareMinerals says
get free shipping and Ulta with any bare
minerals and the promo code is hypsi
bear FS I can put that down below okay
mmm I'm finding myself today like I feel
like don't like second day here going on
it's not looking so great I'm just yeah
you know and I
also I brought my hand sanitizer because
I meant to sanitize my hands but my
hands have that feeling where even when
I use hand sanitizer it just doesn't
feel right it feels like weird and like
mucky muck muck
okay that's my noise I always make when
I'm thinking about my pug Sam or boss
and the older pug I have where they're
just like like little piggies and
they're just constantly grunting if you
have a pug or Noah pod you don't exactly
I mean because they're they just they're
just like pigs I love it this next thing
I just pulled out is wet WH et in it
whatever what is it a nail lacquer and
almost said liqueur like that's not even
the same thing oh it's like this crazy
blue that's really fun I don't know that
I haven't blue this color so that'll be
really nice and I've never heard of this
brand which is always fun nothing wrong
with that it doesn't look very opaque so
that's gonna be interesting with the
color like this if I'm wanting a color
like this I want it to be opaque I don't
want some weird like jelly version of it
so we'll see about that little one
what is this hang ten which we've got
something from that brand before hang
ten eight oh it's SPF of eight
protection it's hardly protection dark
tanning oil mm probably what you
probably won't use this alright there is
this is the B Fuu a daily moisturizer
with SPF of 15 but it's got rosemary
pomegranate and rice I love that
allergen free fragrance so it has a
fragrance but its allergen free paraben
free vegetarian proteins but it's the
brand be fine and if it has like a smell
oh there's not really a smell you can
smell that SPF okay so the last thing in
here is this Pixy tinted brilliance balm
it looks like it might be like really
completely see-through yeah it's like a
well it's got a little bit of pink to it
and I don't know if this is there's like
yeah the shade is unique pink so it's
got a tiny bit of color but I mean it's
barely there which is nice and it's cute
I mean that's adorable little so that's
nice but that was all
what do you guys think I'm gonna say
pretty sure this might have been the
worst attitude I've ever done now not
enough to cancel it because holy crap I
love it see but not so great if C and I
get it a lot of them are summer themed
but for me like I'm about to the school
years about to start so like in my head
summers basically over even though it's
totally not but you know how you get
when you're in that school mindset where
you know I'm like well school start the
summer's over even though really there's
probably two more months of it but so I
don't know I this would have been more
fun to get maybe like a month or two ago
when I was in my summer mindset but
regardless all right boxycharm now this
one I didn't mention but I think you all
know it's these ten hours a month
boxycharm is is it 21 a month I think so
more expensive this one so you know this
one I pay for every month and if you
watched my past videos I typically love
Ipsy but I actually paid for this one
this one they send to me for free so we
will see what is in this one I'm hoping
it's a little bit better than you can
see this month usually they're both
awesome okay
America the Beautiful is the theme and
then there's all the info on the back
but I'm not gonna look at it yet
all right so the for the first thing I
see is a nail polish bright red I don't
typically wear red and this one looks
more like kind of a well no it doesn't
look too blood ready you know that but
it's Lauren B is the brand it's in the
shade Rodeo Drive I mean it's pretty I
probably wouldn't know maybe I would
wear it I need to paint my nails um this
might be a nice toe nail color too you
know that's like a nice red very classic
okay okay you know what no I should see
if it's okay cuz that blue one was not
opaque at all this one doesn't look too
opaque either yeah bummer
well the red and the blue is very
patriotic all right
the next thing I'm seeing in here is
this appeal Cosmetics lipstick never
heard of appeal okay cute packaging and
it looks like it's a pink the shade is
baby my doll
it's just this Barbie paint kind of
definitely a blue tone pink color not
necessarily of color I might wear maybe
look like that maybe a deeper gloss over
it so it doesn't look so Barbie you know
you know what I mean
so we'll see so far still not impressed
this is a bum month what are they
everyone's like it's like July is a
throwaway month or something
so bellapierre cosmetics is a lip liner
that could be nice to say the shade come
on does it say natural that would be
nice I can't get it open
I'd like to bellapierre products that
I've gotten in the past huh huh look at
this what that is not natural for me I
don't know why they call that natural
for someone my skin tone it's certainly
not but I mean it's not a bad lip liner
color in general if you're wearing a
really bold dark lip but it's just an
interesting name for it I would say but
it might it might truly be natural for
someone of other skin tones so okay the
next thing I'm seeing is this pure least
SPF 30 sunscreen
now I've had one of their like just
facial moisturizers before and I liked
it it's okay but I also got that same
like moisturizer in two or three
different subscription boxes so I think
I ended up getting rid of one of them
but anyway so that's interesting I like
that that's PF of 30 I wonder if it has
like a oh it's close I'm not gonna open
it cuz I don't know if I'm gonna end up
keeping it and I want to open it I'm not
so okay it's full-size which is nice 1.7
ounces the last thing is another
bellapierre well I'm assuming it's like
a loose shadow or pigment and it's in
the shade gold and brown not golden
brown golden brown
alright I'll open it okay yeah that's
pretty that's really pretty
it really is like golden brown mix it
almost has like a weird like lime green
tint to it where did it go it's there
somewhere so that's pretty it's very
different I actually think I might use
this I always kind of roll my eyes when
I get loose shadows and boxes cousin
like how often do I really use the
shadows not that often but I mean this
is a very kind of different it's like a
shimmery champagne color but it's got
flecks of like greenish and it's cool
so I actually might use that one but out
of the rest of them both of the I was
kind of disappointed in both this month
right you guys
I'm curious if you get either one of
these subscription services what you
guys got and if you got different
products you get similar products but
every other month and I can link if I
remember to I can link some of the past
if see versus boxycharm videos that I've
done and they're usually so much better
so maybe this was just kind of an off
month I'm certainly gonna keep my Ipsy
subscription I always do I love if see
in boxycharm assuming they keep sending
them to me you know I'll keep open them
for you guys but very disappointed this
one mmm well but hopefully that was
enjoyable and well I'll catch you guys
on the flippety-flip I feel crazy okay
for real bye guys
very serious bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
