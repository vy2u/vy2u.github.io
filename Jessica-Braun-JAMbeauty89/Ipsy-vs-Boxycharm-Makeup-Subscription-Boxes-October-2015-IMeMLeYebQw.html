to do my old-school
epsy versus boxycharm video now they're
not the same price so when I say versus
I mean it's not really a true
competition because obviously they're
not equivalent prices therefore you know
boxycharm if you're spending more for it
then they should be giving you more
full-sized products etc whereas if C is
only $10 boxycharm is 21 so that's
something to keep in mind let's go ahead
and get into the unboxing I love doing
these videos because I think it's so fun
to see like what everyone gets cuz we
all sometimes do get different things um
and I don't know there's just something
fun about subscription box videos I
watch them all the time even boxes that
I know I'm never gonna buy I just like
watching them I don't know maybe I'm
weird is anyone else the same way anyway
um okay so let's start with oopsie cuz
it's ten dollars this is the bag it
always comes with a cute makeup bag it's
it's kind of nice it feels a little more
well-made than most I always tell you
guys that I feel like they switch it's
like one week it's or one month it's not
as well-made next month it is well II
and it goes like back and forth but this
one feels pretty well mning the theme is
alter ego which certainly makes sense
with the gold and the black the first
thing which didn't even fit in the bag
is this really big hair product this is
definitely full size it says in haircare
twelve in one amazing leave-in treatment
this is maximum heat protection and so
it says it's got 12 amazing benefits and
it has Abyssinian oil I've never even
heard of that being used for hair so it
repairs dry damaged hair protection of
split ends and breakage I could use that
my hair I let it air dry so it's kind of
just parts of it are still kind of wet
and just because I was like you know I
need to give my hair a little bit of a
break and I think you guys know what I
mean everyone's why you're just
I'm just gonna let my hair rest today so
today was that day so if it looks a
little cuckoo that would be why but I'm
sure my hair is like thank you but um
yeah so split ends it's a shiny and
healthy hair transforms frizz and silk
no transforms frizz to silk
Wow maximum heat protection seals and
protects hair removes tangle Wow
I mean it's a ton of stuff so very cool
it looks like okay so it's a spray I
want to test this and just kind of see
when we scared my coffee sitting here so
it's like a spray lotion now the only
thing I have oh it smells nice to say
about this kind of a product is
sometimes when it's a lotion spray it
stops up the sprayer nozzle so you have
to like rinse it under hot water every
once in a while at least that's been my
experience so hopefully that will happen
with this but I will certainly try it my
hair could certainly use it um and this
might be really nice just it's obviously
a leave-in treatment might be really
nice if you really are air drying air
drying your hair more often or if you
just want to give it a break you can put
this in and at least know it won't be
too crazy frizzy like I think that would
have helped my hair a lot today actually
okay next thing it's like a little
goodie bag it's like I'm drawing from
the what's the name of the Hat and Harry
Potter Tyler what's the name of the hat
in Harry Potter that they draw their
house out of yes like I'm growing out of
the sorting hat
Tyler has a home either um ooh okay so
this is a fragrance and it just says
pure vanilla and that is also oh it's
from the brand la vanilla I've been
wanting to try things from this brand la
vanilla they have natural deodorants
that I've heard are the best because if
you've ever tried natural deodorant like
none of them work as well obviously than
like the ones that have all the bad
ingredients in it but we all are like
trying to use it you know but it just
doesn't work as well but I've heard the
law vanilla deodorants are really really
good so that's kind of on my wish list
but this is one of their fragrances and
put it on because I actually okay when
they say pure vanilla it's it's vanilla
it's not like that phony well no it
doesn't really smell like phony vanilla
it smells a lot more legitimate than I
feel like a lot of vanilla scented like
lotions and things of course sometimes I
like that like my favorite said about
the body roots is the vanilla bean Noel
and I have and it's probably the
phoniest of vanilla scents but I love it
okay next thing this is from the balm
it's like a miniature little one it says
meet Matt Hughes long lasting liquid
lipstick and the shade is committed
looks like kind of like what I'm wearing
on my lips today umm oh okay okay I need
to get these because I've heard of
people talk about the their lip balms
the Matt Hughes once but these are I
don't know if they're supposed to be
like a liquid lips yeah I just read that
it was a liquid lipstick that shows I'm
not listening to what I'm saying
trying to teach my students they need to
listen and pay attention with the
reading I need to practice what I'm
preaching anyway
so yes it is a liquid lipstick it looks
like it's starting to kind of dry down
um see this makes me want to try more of
these cuz I love the balm but I haven't
tried these yet and I've tried most of
their stuff that's a really pretty color
I'm excited I wish it were full-sized
but I'm excited to try it next thing
says DOS I'm assuming that means dose of
colors yeah is this a lip it's like a
dark purplish gray
okay Twitter's oh it's a nail polish duh
wow it looks really opaque and it this
is a cute little bottle the only
downside is you can't have it like
standing upright but I mean that's cute
and it's a really nice color as we go
like a fifth is a good November color
it's like not quite the Christmas season
yet but it's getting cold and it's still
kind of fall we'll see I got rid of a
lot of my nail polish because a lot
we're old and you guys know I've
decluttered just now all the time but um
I got rid of most of mine so now I feel
like I don't have as many to choose from
which is good so I'm using up what I
have and their colors I love but there
are some colors I no longer have and I
don't think I have anything like this I
used to have the Sally Hansen commander
in cheek which is not it's not this
color at all but it reminds me that
same kind of feel but I don't have
anymore okay the last thing in here is
from Scone cosmetics and it's this
pretty eyes automatic eyeliner in plum
let's open this
it's not even Elsa perfectionist like
I'm almost done opening this but it's
taking forever to peel but I'm I can't
use it even though I could totally get
cap off until I get every last remnant
off I'm like a freak about that okay so
let's see it's a oh it's more purple
than I would have envisioned it's also
not as opaque as I had hoped
gosh I almost feel like I could use this
as a lip liner so it is lighter but um I
certainly don't have anything this color
but I don't know if there's I don't know
if it's one that I really use I might
try it like on my lower lash line cuz
even when I'm branching out and wanting
to do more colorful looks this probably
wouldn't be something I would reach for
so I would love it if it was you know
maybe a more neutral color that we can
all use however this is fun if you were
looking for this kind of color so and it
seems creamy enough like I said it just
wasn't super-dee-duper opaque where I
feel like the Jordana they're like 12
hour intense eyeliner ones that they
have are like 2 or 3 dollars and they're
unbelievably pigmented so something to
keep in mind but that's everything that
was in their eye I think that was pretty
good I like that it was a mixture of
things and that seems to be the trend
with if see a lot like I got one perfume
one nail polish one lip product and
eyeliner and something for hair so that
is really I mean when you think about a
lot of makeup search different boxes
it's only makeup which makes sense but
this is covering all of beauty and I
love that you got one of each thing so
that I love if seaboard that's pretty
cool
so moving on to boxycharm which you know
it's more expensive um this one who
faces of the moon it says like the
phases of the Moon the part of us is
always hidden this month embrace who you
are and let the enchanting beauty of all
of your faces show remember you can
always be whoever you choose to be the
Stars will align in your favor Wow let
your light illuminate the darkness
charmers it's cute um awesome so let's
see you it all looks so dark in here I'm
gonna grab the
thing like a kid on Christmas Mike
Howard open the biggest breast in first
okay this is palmetto derma is the brand
and it's the rejuvenating antioxidant
mask
so it's skin care and I've had a
palmetto derma serum before and I really
really liked I use the whole thing up
and and I have a second one that I've
been using um it kind of smells like um
oops got a little on my nose like kind
of minty I can't really tell kind of
minty kind of like tea if you look it's
got these like exfoliating beads in it
and it looks like a really cool texture
like it's like thick but it has those
beads so um when it's this one you leave
on for a while and then wash off or if
you just wash off let's see what it says
um the antioxidants work to clean skin
and remove damaged while peptides
tag-team to enhance lift loaded with
free radical fighters this mask is sure
to leave your skin looking bright
radiant and its tingly it says get ready
to feel tingly all over apply generously
to face creating a thick coating leave
on for fifteen to thirty minutes you can
leave it on for a while
remove it - remove it use warm damp
cloth wipe in circular motions so this I
will absolutely use but before I use it
as I always do I look it up on Beauty
pedia I'll link it below to see how
dermatologist ranked this specific
product and I've just gotten into the
habit of that I know I kind of spurred a
lot of you guys into that beauty PDF
from Paula's Choice calm
I love it and it's for a good reason
because obviously our skin is really
important and that helps me weed through
the really expensive skincare products
that are actually not doing anything for
you and the ones that actually are so
I'm going to look that up next thing
this is the do say I don't know how to
say it d you do you CC e we've gotten a
few things from them this is their pink
volumizer mascara I mean it's the
mascara pink um I'm I'm its Punk
volumizer mascara I am crazy you're
allowed to make fun of me for that one
Punk volumizer mascara cute packaging
it's you know kind of thicker for a
mascara but it's
this red um see I don't want to I'm
going to open it for your sake I'm going
to open it I always say I don't want to
extend what air to get into it but I am
so curious it's got a really really big
wand I don't mind that to be honest with
you but I've got kind of wider eyes so
it doesn't bother me but if you do have
maybe not as why of eyes it might bother
you I like it says define lashes one by
one making them thicker with spectacular
lashes short and long bristles are made
for separation and lengthening so we
will see I'm excited to try it I love
getting the masters and trying them
because especially since mascara they
dry out you know over the course of a
couple months so it's nice to get them
in subscription boxes from time to time
so then you're not always buying new
ones you get to try different ones okay
next thing is this Lord and berry line
shade eyeliner and shadow pencil it's in
the shade dark locks yep and it's truly
just black that's pretty darn opaque let
me do like a thicker line and it feels
really creamy too so the true test will
be the wear time because any liner can
be really creamy but if it's running all
over the place but I always use a pencil
liner toward you guys before I kind of
do the triple layer I line it with a
pencil like tight line it between my
lashes and then I use gel or cream liner
and then I put when I have the time I'll
put on like the Sela liquid liner that I
love so much the Stila stay all day
liquid liner
um I guess always trip will do it
because then it just doesn't move and I
know from 5:00 in the morning when I'm
getting ready to you know 11:00 at night
when I'm taking my makeup off it doesn't
bugs like it doesn't smudge at all it
just it just stays put it's like I've
just done it for years and I love it so
I will definitely use this up next thing
is another nail polish it remind it's a
similar color to the one from its D
let's I'm going to pull them out and
compare them side-by-side well I guess
not that similar this one's more purple
this one's grey but the brand is called
and this is called boneyards I love that
maybe I'll pick my nails this color for
Halloween this week um very very cool it
says apply two coats and then put a top
coat
duh okay so that's awesome I will
definitely try it let us see how yeah it
looks really okay can't see the brush at
all it's kind of my simple test to see
but sometimes it's true and sometimes
it's not all right the last thing in
this boxycharm is the coral cheek and
lip stain by bella pierre now bella
pierre makes my favorite lip gloss of
all time it's called vanilla sponge cake
I think is what it's called and I look I
shouldn't say of all the time I've got
many that I love but it's one of my
favorites that I got probably a year ago
in a subscription box um I'm trying to
think if I ended up getting rid of it
because it was getting pretty old I was
like I don't member if that's when I
kept or not when I declutter but this is
something I don't want cream blush so I
might try it as a cream blush but I know
myself I think I've gotten rid of all my
cream blushes cuz I just don't use them
but for a lip stain that is a pretty
color and if you threw a gloss on top of
it as well that's nice um I like that
it's a more neutral color I think that's
going to actually be really pretty in
the spring you know or if you're wearing
your really bright outfit like mine you
don't want a bright lip as well so
that's pretty and it feels nice that's
it doesn't I don't think it has a smell
at all let me smell the actual no not a
smell anything so that's nice so
sometimes these kinds of products can
have like a plasticky smell but this one
doesn't smell like that at all so that's
awesome
so that was everything in both of those
boxes I will leave my entire
subscription box playlists from years of
opening these types of boxes on my
channel I'll link that down below if
you're interested I hope that you will
subscribe and join our little family
here and I'll catch you guys in my next
one five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
