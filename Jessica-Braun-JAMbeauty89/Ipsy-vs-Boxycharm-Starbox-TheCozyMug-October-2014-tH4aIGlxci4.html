Ipsy versus boxycharm but I also have a
starlooks unboxing and a cozy mug
subscription box unboxing I'm really
excited I was gonna do these separately
but I thought why not just combine them
all into one because if you're watching
my Ipsy vs. boxycharm video odds are you
just like subscription boxes in general
so I'm just gonna smash them all into
one I'm excited so we'll start with the
Ipsy box since technically that is the
main part of the video if C is $10 a
month it always comes with a makeup bag
and usually like four or five no I think
five makeup goodies and then if you get
points on their site for referring
friends or reviewing products you can
get like points and then you can apply
them for different makeup goodies to be
sent in your next bag for free so the
looks like the theme is Beauty candy I
don't know if these are a bunch of
youtubers yeah they're it see stylist
yeah I would assume these are like
youtubers as well anyway awesome this is
the bag
I don't okay I don't like makeup bags
that have the zipper like part of the
way down because it's harder for me I
feel like to get into it I don't know
I'm really weird about it so I have
never really liked this kind and they do
this kind every once a while I don't
know but this is cute I like the color
and how it's like would be easy to clean
so let's see this one Ben is a nail
polish ooh very very vampy like one of
those dare I say it like ox blood reds
it says feeling very cherry well I would
say less cherry a little more dark dark
dark but it's pretty and it's hard to
show the tint but it does have kind of a
reddish tint to it but really dark I
like that I'll probably wear that as we
go deeper into winter because I mean
it's fall here except for its snowed on
Halloween so it might as well be winter
already okay the next thing I'm seeing
is this o start looks which I have a
star looks box we're gonna open here in
a bit it is it a lip gloss it's like
teenie
tiny let's open it and see this might be
one that I give to like a sister a
friend cuz I have so many lip glosses
and this is such a baby one it's a
pretty color that maybe I will keep it
cuz it looks like it'd be good I'm like
the lipstick I'm wearing today maybe
I'll just keep it that's a pretty color
maybe I will keep it but it's so teeny
it's cute though
cute cute good for travel I guess okay
the next thing is this volume eyes
literally volume eyes Oh from model Co I
guess yeah this is a full size it looks
a little smaller than most full-size but
I would bet and it never says on the
card I wish it did but it doesn't I
don't want to open it because I don't
want to get air into it you know because
I don't know how long it will be before
I actually use this mascara and I don't
want to have too many open so we'll see
about that but all the Monaco products
that I've tried in the past I've liked I
don't think I've tried a model Co one
that I didn't like so that's good
ooh this is oh it's a hand cream what
compute this packaging is it says
Roseberry
I guess that's the brand hand cream made
in the UK fingers and Rouge cool it's
got shea butter it's got packaging like
the locks of ten or ten I don't know how
to say that word ones
oh I'll use this oh it smells nice oh oh
it does smell like figs in a good way
and Rose it's gosh it almost makes me
think of this gonna be really specific
like the you know the sour straws that
are gummy that you can eat that's what
it smells like almost exactly it smells
good though but it makes me hungry for
those like my mouth is watering right
now thank you mom okay the last thing in
here is this epi say I don't know how to
say that word purifying exfoliant it
says moistened skin with lukewarm water
use alone or with a cleanser small
circular motion yeah yeah yeah leave on
for a few minutes then rinse thoroughly
used once or twice a week
cool I probably will try that because
the exfoliator I'm using right now is
like it I think it's an aah a exfoliate
or not a BH a
remember regardless it's not one that
you scrub off it's one that you just
leave on and it's supposed to exfoliate
your skin without actually scrubbing
anything it's more it's a deeper level
than that so I'm excited to have one
that is like this so that was the whole
epsy bag that's not bad for ten bucks I
mean these this is Nicole by OPI by the
way the first thing I open I didn't
mention that these are about six dollars
where I live I don't know how much this
would retail for but probably about five
dollars this is probably about five the
starlooks is probably even more although
it's a miniature and then throw in the
mascara as well I mean that's certainly
worth your money and I like that it's a
bunch of different things we got some
makeup we got a nail polish we got some
skin care stuff so I think that was
pretty good if si you stepped up since
last week that's for sure okay so the
next thing is the boxycharm which I love
this one's more expensive all the info
is down below for all of this stuff you
guys know it will be um now hmm okay
stop just don't look Jess okay the it's
bewitched since this is the October box
which by the way I'm filming this now
and it's the end of October but I just
got these like I had my Ipsy but I just
got my boxycharm in the mail so it was
like super-dee-duper late or whatever
maybe it always comes this late but it's
just whatever I was getting impatient
so bewitch this theme which sounds fun
okay okay this is so exciting this is
the palmetto derma collagen booster and
restoration serum and it's got vitamin C
and hyaluronic acid this serum which you
put on after you've cleansed and toned
your face or at least cleansed it if you
don't tone it or you use toner on it you
put the serum on or any serum on before
you put on your moisturizer or night
cream or whatever or day cream whatever
I just said whatever so many times
anyway I already have this and I don't
know where I got it if I got it in
another box or maybe I got it with
referral points or something but I got
it just on a whim and I tried it and I
loved it my skin is so much better than
it was and
the only thing I've switched up in my
routine so I'm feeling this must be it
and I'm so excited to get the exact same
product another full-size I am so
excited it says it plumps skin cells and
protects and restores I am so excited
yes okay so that's a good one
ooh the next thing I'm seeing is this
Eclipse palette by is it coach yeah
Coastal Scents
oh is it a concealer palette 15
concealer shades oh my gosh it certainly
got every color you could ever need even
a lavender and like a mint green and a
white I would assume for like
highlighting I guess but how often will
I use this since I'm not a makeup artist
I don't know but it certainly will be
fun to play with and if I'm ever like
with friends doing their makeup it'll be
nice to have more options so I don't
have to go out and buy a bunch of you
know different colored things that I
would never use nice so that's kind of
cool to get I wonder let's swatch one
and see I'm gonna pick one that I think
would maybe be closest to my skin one of
these lighter ones maybe this one okay
so it's certainly like I mean it's got a
lot of oomph to it oh and it feels like
it blends out really well actually
and now I'd be curious to see how it
last throughout the day and if it sinks
into fine lines but that's nice I like
having the options and certainly sleep
probably wouldn't travel with it but you
know whoa okay so oh I guess I can tell
you what these all retail for because
boxycharm lays it out okay
woah this Palmetto derma serum is $48
for this size one fluid ounce you guys I
hope I never run out because I'm not
really buying that for $50 you kidding
me okay the Eclipse concealer palette
1995 for this so oh we've certainly got
our money's worth so far the next thing
oh it's an eyeshadow from be a bombshell
I've gotten some of their singles before
and I liked them but you know you have
so many palettes and things it's like
ooh
try to picture myself actually wearing
this on my eyes I don't know the shade
is always a bridesmaid I think I already
said that this retails for $14 I don't
know and I'm trying to even think of
anyone I would I don't know I might try
it cuz I certainly don't have anything
this color let's see the pigmentation
whoa
definitely pigmented there it is gosh
you should you can almost see some blush
forget it
well it's a good formula at least
alright next thing ooh an eye liner
another star look so there were star
looks in my Ipsy their star looks in my
boxycharm and I'm about to open a star
looks subscription box so that isn't
over the motive store looks it Oh what
color it's called ultra olive and it
looked well it's an olive color it looks
really pretty like that greenish gold
again a great one for lower lash line or
even gosh you could I wonder if you
could blend it yeah and use it as almost
an eye base or something like that
doesn't work as well as I'd hoped but it
does have some shimmer to this one and
even on the packaging you can see the
shimmer so that is the shimmery one but
it's pretty my only fear would be if you
use it on your lower lash line and then
like there ends up being glitter
throughout the day all in this region I
mean it could be in a worse place I mean
that's alright but I just hate that I've
got students that'll be like Miss Bert
if you got glitter all over your face
I'm like oh my gosh does not mean for
glitter to be all over your face because
of an eyeshadow and eyeliner okay the
last thing in here are these nail
polishes it says cult commerce by box
air times boxy charmer by boxy charm you
know what I mean
shady is that the brand I don't
understand this but these colors are
really pretty it's like this vampy
purple and then like a black I mean you
know that's uh now I have a lot of dark
nail polishes I didn't even paint my
nails at all this month it's not
terrible and it's wrong as things that
every time I look at them like oh I want
to paint them but
then you're so busy and you guys know
how it is with full-time jobs and many
other things in your life going on the
last thing you're thinking about this
painting your nails but I miss it so I
need to get kind of back on that
bandwagon and force myself to because I
love doing it and I love having my nails
painted regardless these are pretty I
don't know how much you don't get out
because they're so dark but again with
both of those boxes they are you know
keeping it very themed when it comes to
the season in the holiday which I think
it's just fun so I'm all for it
okay the next thing actually you know
what before I do the star like I got to
do this one because I'm too excited and
I want to know what's in it I cut it
open because they're packaged like in a
regular box and it's hard to get open
I'm over explaining so this is the cozy
mug all the info for this subscription
boxes below but it's basically a tea
subscription box and I love it so much
I've gotten it to other months and they
send it to me to review and when I first
got it I didn't I didn't know what to
expect because I've never heard about it
and it was adorable and if you've seen
any videos where I unbox them they're so
cute they're so themed and like these
are all fall themed ones and they are
the way that they package the boxes is
adorable so I have Pete in and I was
like so I'm really excited so once you
kind of tear into it it's got all these
Halloween my decorations and stuff so
let's go ahead and dig in the first
thing I see in these tins there's two of
them is this zena's or zayna's caramel
apple organic red tea I want to know oh
my gosh so it's these little sachets
that are like enough you know disk form
how many are in here one two three four
yeah the smell it smells exactly here
mom gosh he's almost smell like pipe
tobacco but it smells fantastic and I
have to admit I've never tried red tea
and I'm sure I will like it so I'm
excited the other one oh it's red tea as
well and it's pumpkin spice let's see oh
my gosh you guys know these smell crazy
good oh my gosh they do smell like pipe
tobacco though but in the best of ways
adorable love these tins - I want to
like see if I can reuse them out or it's
they're so nice so that's awesome what
else here Oh Ghirardelli double
chocolate a little packet for hot
chocolate adorable Halloween candies in
it and like little dick that is adorable
what a cute touch oh okay so now there's
this little like Halloweeny bag what's
inside of it
Oh looks like so is it so triple butter
pumpkin salt with shea butter cocoa
butter mango butter fragrances pumpkin
pie spice it's from an Etsy shop it's
opened gifts by LJN
it's a little pumpkin how cute I think
that's pretty cool that they partnered
with an Etsy shop I just an FC Etsy
that's smart
so smart okay so the next thing I'm
seeing is this like a little gift tag
that says happy Halloween or a joyful
Halloween and it's like vintage cool and
then this is all wrapped up I don't know
oh it looks like a chapstick the first
box I got from them oh my gosh which was
my favorite know all I can't decide but
it came with like a lip balm a really
expensive lip balm and it that what they
said on the card was so you don't burn
your lips on the tea I thought that was
so cute okay this one is okay I guess
the brand is crazy rumors and it's a
candy corn lip balm and it has shea
butter made in the USA cruelty free and
vegan that is adorable that is so cute
hey and the other day was national candy
corn day okay so the last thing I think
that I'm seeing other than all the
Halloween candy in there is this with a
skull on it what it is it's a it says
don't drink and fly and it's got a
little drool on it
I'm dropping it it's just a blank card
you can use that is adorable
it says it's made by paper and jam Hey -
another NC shop paper and jams at sea
calm
this is adorable oh my gosh I don't know
how these are curated or who's actually
designing them or putting there these
are I just love it and I cannot wait
till Christmas because you know those
are gonna be stupid adorable oh my gosh
but this has been amazing I love getting
these I love them and I still I think
the last one came with like honey spoons
or maybe the last few and one of them is
a shape of a cute teapot and I think I'm
going to use it later today speaking of
I wanted to share with you guys I'm
drinking tea right now which I'm usually
been drinking tea or coffee while I'm
filming and slash all the time what am I
talking about this was from one of the
past boxes and it's the art of tea green
tea Jasmine Reserve and it is the most
amazing jasmine tea I've ever had now
jasmine tea is like I don't know unless
you're like a tea connoisseur which I'm
not never will be to me they're all very
similar like they're all kind of the
same but this one is like it's like
something special I don't know how to
describe it but there's a certain thing
to it that's just so good so I think I
might go online and order more of these
because it only came with one of this
flavor and it came with other flavors
but oh my gosh I'm just it's so good
okay so the last box is my Starbucks box
and you see it's a glow of grace from
here on YouTube and actually I'd seen
her face and see in some videos but I
haven't watched her a lot but she seems
really sweet so I think I might check
out her channel little more but she I
guess was the curator or whatever for
this box this month and they they've
done a few youtubers youtuber curated
boxes which i think is cool so let's see
there she is isn't she beautiful oh my
gosh
she is so gorgeous she looks like a
Disney Princess doesn't she like for
real ah okay so this is the star looks
brow kit okay that's all that's in here
so that must be it I would bet this
retails for a lot then so on the back it
says it's got a wax highlighter a brow
and two different brow powders and a
little thing and it looks like there
might be stencils as well so let's tear
into this okay so it's got a giant
mirror on one side and then on this side
oh it has tweezers too so it's got a
stencil tweezers
I'll probably use that brush and then to
different route powders that one
actually looks like it probably would do
just fine for my brows and then this
yeah that one's a wax and this is like a
is it a cream yeah it's like a cream
highlight for under your brow that's
nice I probably really will now the only
downside about kits like this is they're
great but if you're trying to travel you
can't bring it and when you get used to
what you're doing with your brows so if
I got used to using this it would be
really difficult to travel so I'd
probably have to like d-pod it because I
like that color is probably dead-on
perfect but we will see so I'll have to
give it a try but cool that it's all in
one I don't know how much this retails
for but um I would bet it retails for a
latke starlooks honestly their makeup is
really expensive the boxes are great
because they're only what are they ten
dollars maybe fifty I don't know I think
it's ten which is nothing when you get
usually you get a few things but if it's
like a kit it's usually one thing
sometimes they'll send a whole pallet so
if you're buying them separately they're
really really extremely expensive makeup
but if you're buying them in these boxes
it's so much cheaper so it is really
cool
so I'm excited to give that a try so
hopefully that was fun for you guys to
watch I know that was a lot of boxes
which some of you are probably jumping
for joy because I love subscription box
unboxing videos but if you don't you're
probably miserable be sure to check out
my other unboxing videos on here I've
got many other boxycharm versus if seas
and just many other ones some of my
other favorites are the try the world
box which is like a food subscription
which is amazing so if you're interested
definitely check out my channel and all
of those playlists and I'll catch you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
