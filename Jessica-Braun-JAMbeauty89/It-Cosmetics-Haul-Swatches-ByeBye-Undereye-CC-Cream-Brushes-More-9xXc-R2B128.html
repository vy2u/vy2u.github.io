bringing you a ginormous it cosmetics
haul and I put halt in quotes because
they sent this stuff to me and I am just
over the moon because two years ago when
I started my youtube channel I never
would have thought I would have been
close to 100,000 subscribers I never
would have thought that companies would
send me so many things to try out I know
how blessed that I am and I hope you
guys know that I know that and I'm so
excited to give these a try review them
on my channel as you're watching this
haul let me know what your top two or
three products that you would love to
see a review on are below I think I'm
just I'm trying to feel you guys out I
don't want to do reviews on products
that you guys don't care about but I do
want to review the ones that you are
genuinely interested in that you're like
okay how does it work what does it look
like when you put it on etc you guys
know that the way that I do reviews
typically is that I do a demo of me
applying it as well so that you can see
okay what does it actually look like
when you're putting it on how do you
actually apply it etcetera so let's go
ahead and dig in I am so excited let's
start with the thing that they are in my
opinion the most known for which is
their it cosmetics CC cream they have a
shade that actually works for someone as
fair as me and it's in the shade fair I
don't know that they used to have fair I
might have made that up in my head but
light is way too dark but fair is just
right and what I love is that it's a
squeezy tube again it's perfect for
travel it's always in the back of my
mind but it also is a pump which i think
is so cool and this I've only worn once
or twice so far I love that it has an
SPF of 50 and I think for when you're
just going to be out and about all
summer long this is nice it doesn't make
your skin look greasy which is so hard
to find I think in a BB cream or a CC
cream whatever it has decent coverage
but it's definitely not full coverage
but I'm sure I will do a review on this
soon as I try it more another thing they
sent was there it's giant their CC
radiance ombre bronzer now I got two of
their ombre products and this is one of
them and it of course fades from darker
to lighter this can be used as a
highlight down here and then of course
the top part is more of a bronzer you
can apply it I
the idea is that you can take a brush
and sweep across and then sweep that
across your face as well and it's gonna
be just right no I mean maybe if you
really take the time but I'm not taking
the time to do something like that so
for me what I end up doing is I either
swirl it around in this area for a
bronzy part or in this area for a
highlight or just all of it to just kind
of get a bronzy glow it is really nice
is it my favorite bronzer I've ever used
no I think this would look better on
someone with a deeper skin tone this is
the CC radiance ombre blush and it's in
the in the shades in a thick quoi hold
on to this one oh this is in the shade
warm radiance but this is genis a quoi
and it again has that idea where you can
apply it so that your highlights up here
but it is a really product pretty color
when you scroll down together as you can
see I think it's really nice swirled you
could get a littler brush and use just
that area for highlight etc but I
typically just swirl it it is a nice
blush and I will say this lasted all day
when I put it on but I do want to try it
out a few more times to see how I like
it
another thing they sent I was very
excited to try it is there bye-bye pores
poreless finish HD micro powder and
micro powder is a perfect name for it
it's so finely milled and the idea is
that you can put it like in for me I put
it in my t-zone to kind of make that
area just a little more poreless not as
shiny and just to set any foundation or
whatever I have on underneath it is
really nice I've even used this under my
eye to set that area and it works really
well for that too I don't think it
necessarily brightens and this is
translucent
it doesn't necessarily brighten like
other things like that would but it's
not really supposed to but it does a
good job I think I think you can use the
elf ones though and they're just as good
that's what I'll say okay another thing
they sent is the it cosmetics I love
that I keep saying it cosmetics as if
all of this stuff isn't from it
cosmetics I'm an idiot okay this is
their celebration foundation
illumination light and again this is a
little too dark for me you can kind of
see I mean it works and I've used it in
this area but it is a little too dark
but I think in the summer it'll be
perfect but it's just a true powder
foundation it's got a lot of pigment to
it but it
out of five but you can kind of see
where did I just put it right there that
it's just a little bit darker but it
works it'll work just fine as the summer
rolls around I am so excited for warmer
weather do I think this is so much
better than any other powder foundation
I've tried not necessarily but again I
haven't used it enough to really say I'm
sounding really negative about all these
we're getting to some ones that I really
really like but you guys know even
though I was set this stuff for
consideration I will always be honest
with you guys so next thing this is one
that I have loved this is there bye-bye
under-eye concealer and it says it's got
collagen vitamin C and K and it's in
light I used it today on my under eye
this is the kind of stuff that you get a
tiny amount out and I mean a tiny amount
and it could cover your entire face it's
insane so a little bit goes a long way I
feel like you buy this once and you like
never buy it again at least for like two
years it is amazing at covering and
brightening which is why I love it so
much it doesn't move this is the first
concealer I was even tellin Tyler when I
get in the car after a long day at work
and I look in the rearview mirror to
just kind of check out my makeup and see
how it's looking this is the only
concealer where I don't like I look at
and I'm like oh my gosh it looks exactly
as it did at 5:00 this morning when I
was putting it on it is unbelievable
unbelievable and this reminds me of the
hard candy glamoflauge but this is way
better and it doesn't have the same like
smell that the glamoflage one does haha
that one is amazing they also sent this
feel the moment anti-aging ultra
hydrating sensory awakening Wow
primer serum and the idea is that you
can use this at night before bed as like
a serum or you can use it as the serum
before you put on foundation kind of as
primer that's why it's called a primer C
serum I can't see her server purim and
so it's got a little pump there they
also send it in a box with a little
medicine dropper if you'd prefer to
apply it that way which i think is
pretty cool to have the option and I'm
probably gonna use this for science
experiments in my classroom when I am
done using it I'm gonna be honest anyway
it does have well okay two things about
this I've only
use it like twice it it's kind of you
know a wet formula that becomes more
like silicone type feeling but it has
this smell it's a good smell to me but
it reminds me of the oil they use on
baptisms like on babies it reminds me of
like frankincense and myrrh I don't even
know it smells good but it's a very very
strong smell so if you know you don't
like that kind of a smell if you know
what I'm talking about then you probably
would hate this but it made my skin look
nice but I don't I haven't noticed a
huge difference yet but I've only used
it twice so I'm gonna keep trying that
out
they sent me okay this is another
favorite then I already want another one
for my wedding I want like five of these
on backup this is their it cosmetics
tightline full-length flash black primer
so this stuff is genius
and it's crazy because I watched Emily
Noelle earlier this morning I was
getting ready and she had happened to
bring up
she was an empties video and she had
happened to finish this and she hated it
and I was like what but that's just it
people have very different views on how
they like makeup to work so the idea of
this is that it's this tiny tiny tiny
tiny tiny brush but you get it right in
your tight line and you wiggle it up and
I never use this alone I although it
actually looks pretty alone I use it
this morning but you get your tight line
and it fills in blackens that area right
there where your lashes meet your lid
and it is the most amazing at doing your
lower lash line oh my gosh like there's
no clumps no nothing and it does I will
say it adds length so you don't have to
use another mascara with it but I always
do because I like more volume but for
tight lining that area it's taken out a
step like now although it's added its
own so regardless now I don't have to
take like I'll usually use a pencil
liner and tight line now I just use this
and then throw another coat of mascara
from another one on top and it's perfect
this is for sure it's waterproof for
sure what I'm wearing on my wedding day
especially on my lower lash line because
it gets it's very exact and furthermore
it's why
so when I'm bawling my eyes out because
I'm so happy I won't have it running
down my face and there's been no like
fallout on my face and not only that but
my lashes on my lower lash line by the
end of the day usually you're kind of
clumped together they just don't look
great they're flawless at the end of the
day so far out of all of these these two
are like I would go and just pay my own
money of mine they're unbelievable okay
keep going this they sent two of their
vitality lip flushes and the first one
is in love story and I think the idea
behind these is that I'm running in a
room is that they kind of change with
your skin like with your lips so this
one's in the shade love story arity said
that and it's just kind of a light
brownish nude I like it and these don't
have a smell really at all flush is a
good name for it because it just gives a
nice wash of color it's not like you
know a lipstick the other one they sent
is one of my favorites it's in Oh wrong
one grab the other one
it's gonna say quoi again so it's the
same name as their ombre blush that they
sent but it is clear or so it seems like
a clearish white pink anyway but you put
it on and again it kind of goes on clear
but it's kind of got this like light
pink shimmer to it if you can see that
but as it wears on your lips after a few
minutes it kind of it makes your lips
look like you just bit them does that
make sense it it's so cool I don't know
and again it's such a cool one to use
like in the warmer months like spring
and summer because it looks like you
don't really care you just like slap it
on and then your lips just kind of get
this like perfectly natural flush of
color and you can see it's starting to
change a little bit I think yeah it's a
little more Pinker a little more pink I
love this this is another one that I
genuinely genuinely love so they sent
three of their lip liners and I have to
admit I have not tried these yet these
are they're your lips but better
waterproof lip liners now if these are
good again this might be one I don't
know that I've ever come across a lip
liner that claims to be waterproof but
they sent three of them there's this red
one which is in the shade cherry flush
and it is retractable so you
can to keep that point pointed you just
use the sharpener that's on the back to
kind of get it back to its former glory
they also sent two very wearable colors
in my opinion spicy nude which reminds
me of Milan ease spice lip liner that I
love and then they also sent the one
that if I like I probably would wear on
my wedding and it's in the shade
blushing nude which i think is just nice
and it's just um again it's still a
brown type nude but it's just a little
bit lighter than that spicy one is they
feel really creamy but again I won't
review them until I've tried them for a
while another thing that I actually was
surprised that I liked was the it
cosmetics your brows the better now this
is one that supposedly is universal and
anyone can use it
the lighter you push the lighter the
color is the harder you push the darker
it is and it's true like if you if I sit
here and here I'll do it I'm gonna have
to do it down here so like that's the
light a little harder a little harder
is it working yet and then even Hartman
I can't it's hard to pray I don't want
to like break it but you really can get
different even different like shades of
the same thing and then if you really go
for it it can get pretty dark so you can
see that it really does do as it claims
to do but what I have noticed is that
once you brush through it with the
spoolie on the end which is a pretty
good spoolie I have to admit as you
brush through it it lightens itself
which makes sense but it kind of changes
the shade that you had so like some of
these you see like this one pulls red
but right here it's not so once I brush
through that darker it starts to turn a
little bit more reddish so that is my
one gripe because you guys know me I
don't like my brows to pull red at all I
don't know why but for some reason I
just don't think it looks right on my
skin tone but I will say as long as I
apply it where I don't need to brush
through it too much which most of the
time I don't it's fantastic or if you do
like that more reddish tone you'd love
it but I will say I was surprised but I
still like my Anasazi one better the
last thing they sent were four of their
brushes now I don't know the names of
all of these because it wasn't on what
it was so the first one they sent is
this ginormous one and it is a
amazing for not only obviously I mean
it's like the size of my entire like
face like look but it's amazing for just
dusting powder whatever all over if you
wanted to dust you know a shimmer thing
it's just so big that it works so well
for that
anything else no but it is so soft and
nice the next one they sent is this
blush brush and I love this I've been
using it I can't stop using it because
it's really soft just like that one is
but it's the perfect shape and they sell
time I mean tons of brands sell a blush
brush like this but I really do love
this when it's so soft and it seems to
apply any blush even if it's a crazy
pigmented one it seems to still apply it
in an even manner so I really really
that's my favorite they also sent two of
they're very very synthetic brushes this
one I've used it's like a stipple brush
I've been using it with my color pop
blushes because those are kind of that
cream to powder formula and I really
like the way they've been applying so
this is nice although I do think the elf
ones are just as nice as are the Real
Techniques and then they also sent this
one which is a double airbrush see this
one actually says it it's their double
airbrush ball powder brush and I haven't
really used this one much because it's
so like rubbery feeling almost that I
haven't quite found the right thing to
apply it with so I'm gonna play with
this one a little bit more and get back
to you let me know what your favorite
cosmetics products are especially if
it's one that I don't have yet because I
would always be interested to try more
but again if I were to recommend like
two or three products that out of the
line you should own because they're
amazing it would be the bye bye
under-eye it's amazing it doesn't move
the tight line mascara I put that in
quotes because again I use it with
another but it is amazing and hmm what
would be my third honestly I think it
would be because the CC is nice I've
used a couple times but I don't know
that I love love love it as much as some
other things so I still want to play
with this I would recommend the genes--
a qua vitality lip flush it's so there
it's dark in a little bit do you see
that it's so amazing it is so amazing
and it's different than anything I've
ever tried so those would be my three
recommendations so far but I'm sure I
might
my turn after trying them for a while
again hopefully that was helpful if you
enjoy please subscribe for more reviews
and I'll catch you guys in my next one
