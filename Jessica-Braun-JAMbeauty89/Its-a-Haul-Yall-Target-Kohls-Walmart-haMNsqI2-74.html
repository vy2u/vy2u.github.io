have a sort of collective haul for you
all and it's just some things I've
picked up the past week things that I
needed maybe things that I didn't need
but it was a really good deal so I
figured I would share that with you all
and sorry about my hair it's no I'm not
sorry I just want natural today and it's
just kind of air dried and that is that
and I just feel feeling good today so
anyway so here we go one of the first
places I went this week was Walmart and
I haven't gone to Walmart in a while
honestly and so I was kind of to be
there it's like a kid that candies or
there's just so much to look at but one
of the things I picked up are these
Rimmel nail polishes and I only picked
up two I had a coupon for like $1 off
naturally I had a coupon I know I have
coupons like everything but this is the
Rimmel 60 seconds nail color and this
one is in the shade mint delicious and
it's just like a mint green color and
these are only a dollar 50 and then of
course if you find a coupon it'd be even
less and then this one is called caramel
cupcake and this one is so pretty I put
it on last night and then I ended up
painting my nails this color which
you'll see in a second but this is a
really really pretty color I'm excited
to use it for fall it's just like a it
almost like blends in with my skin it
looks really really cool I really like
it the formulas seemed really nice I
can't answer any questions about like
how long they last or anything yet but
once I try these out I'll be sure to let
you guys know typically on my Instagram
but I'll maybe I'll do a video on it
okay another thing I picked up at
Walmart was ah my Revlon Colorstay and
this isn't normal to dry skin I used to
get the combo oily skin one and it would
just I would notice there'd be dry
patches and it would have good coverage
but throughout the day I would have like
dry patches around my nose and
especially up here and which was really
bizarre because I have oily skin there
so it was very weird so I decided to try
the normal to dry skin hoping it would
be more moisturizing and it is and it's
the same staying power the same coverage
I love it and I haven't noticed any
patching so this is in the shade 150
buff I got it like a shade darker than I
normally would just because it we're
going into summer and you know and it
works with my skin tone already but yeah
so what else did I get it one more oh
this I didn't know Walmart had like a
little
dollar section and so I was like
flipping out you know target has that
well Walmart does now to sort of it of
course it was all messy and a mess but I
got this little bag it's just a little
zebra print bag and I'm gonna use it in
my purse to hold like like ibuprofen and
you know things like that I'm lactose
intolerant so I have to bring lactase
with me everywhere all those kinds of
things like little flossers that would
just otherwise be like right now I have
them all in a ziploc bag inside of my
makeup bag this would be so much better
to put all those in so I'm excited to
use this in a Miss a dollar well okay
another thing okay this I picked up at
the Dollar Tree and if you have one near
you oh man I go there like once a week I
just love it there but this is the
laboratory of Oris whitening rinse and
it's one of those pre brush rinses you
use and I really like it because you can
brush your teeth afterwards sometimes my
mouth feels funny if I do like one of
the whitening rinses where you do it
after you brush you know what I'm saying
I really really like this I've been
using it this is like the third or
fourth one I bought and they're great
and they actually sell them for more
than a dollar at like I think Walmart
and some other drugstores but these are
the same size and they're at the Dollar
Tree and I've checked the expiration
they're always good something you got to
do at the dollar store check the
expiration dates on things but I really
really like this I recommend it it's so
much cheaper than the others and it has
the same effect I'd like to think my
teeth are decently white hey anyway okay
another thing I got at the dollar store
oh my gosh okay you guys are gonna make
fun of me I know you should know this
about me
I am completely obsessed with Disney
Disney World
Disney movies Disney cups like I'm
looking at my coffee mug right now I'm
gonna show it to you hold on
alright so this is when my boyfriend and
I went to Disney World
um last year we go like twice a year I
know it's crazy I love Disney World
though okay so this is us in front of
the castle and by the partner statue and
um and then this is another one of us in
Hollywood studios and um okay we met
when I was playing Jasmine and he was
playing Aladdin in a musical here in
town and we both are like actor singers
and dancers as well and so on here
I put the caption and alladin show
Jasmine a whole new world and then um
yeah I just I love this mug I most of my
mugs are Disney and I just love them so
when I was at the Dollar Tree I found
this little gem it's a little Minnie
Mouse like fake backpack but I am going
to use this and it came with like
markers and things in it and I have a
receipt in there I'm a class act folks
anyway but I'm gonna use this in my gym
bag to hold like my jewelry in because
when I you know you work out you take
your jewelry off because I'm usually
coming from like teaching or something
and so I can like put my watches and
things in here and zip it up and that
way I know where to find him a lot of
times I'll put it in my purse and then
it ends up at the bottom of my purse
getting all scratched up for the road
next month and then I can't find it you
know what I mean so I was excited with
this and it was only a dollar and it was
Minnie Mouse so I was very excited all
right so let's see let's see
so then Kohl's and I have like a five
dollar Rewards thing and oh my gosh I'm
so excited about this this is like
records it's the princess Vera Wang line
and it's this really really cute
necklace it's got it's a gold chain but
then it's got gold and silver hearts and
then like a rhinestone heart and like a
darker one and it is so cute and you can
actually will wear like pretty high up
on your neck I love this I am just so
excited to wear this I'm gonna probably
wear it like every day but it's just so
cute and it was $18 of course
everything's always on sale at Kohl's so
it was like I think half price like nine
and then I had a five dollar off coupon
and a 20% off coupon what so I got it
might as well event free and then I also
picked up some silver medallion earrings
this is from the Sonoma Life &amp;amp; Style
line and I just I realized that I don't
have that much silver jewelry anymore
because I got rid of it a long time ago
like when I was getting into gold and
then I realized I ain't like no silver
so I was excited to get these they're
just simple I really like they had a lot
but I like that these were a little bit
more like imperfect if you will almost
tribal in its own little way but I
really liked these and these were I
think like seven and then it was like
twenty percent off so I like 40 off do
you Matt okay
560 who love math sorry okay so then I
went to Target I think that's the last
place and I've been getting on this like
well I'm always on an organization kick
but I really need to organize my drawer
and so I've been looking for some things
and these were in a two pack in the
target dollar section though these cute
little things they're about like the
size of my hand and they had a bunch of
Jose like baby blue I think green pink
black so a dollar for two it's such a
good deal so I bought a few I figure
I'll be using these you'll probably be
seeing an organization video coming up
using these and speaking of organization
I also picked these up from Target these
are these huge dark gray like organizers
these are only a dollar each and so I
bought two of them for my drawers as
well also in the dollar section they had
a bunch of different colors as well so
these are great organizers they're
simple to just like you know that bendy
plastic but they'll be great to keep
some things organized so I'm really
excited to see how I use those and
perhaps do a video on them okay another
thing I bought some more organizers for
my vanity and these are really small
like I have three drawer ones from the
Container Store but they're a lot bigger
these are really really small like the
size of my hand as well and know these
three drawer ones and pretty much all
you can fit in them is like maybe some
concealers or some lipsticks and things
lip glosses don't really fit long ways
in them but these were on clearance for
664 and it was in the bathroom
organization section not near the towels
but in the bathroom organization section
so look for these because they're like
all that stuff is on clearance and I was
like what so I bought two of these I'm
already utilizing one right now and I'm
gonna see how I utilize this one but
awesome awesome and right to the price
there 949 so that's not too bad but
still awesome deal go get you something
in uh-huh thank you a lot of gorgeous
for that one also they're stackable
they're made so that you can stack them
so they're it's really cool alright
let's see I also picked up the elf
makeup mist and set from Target and this
is great it reminds me sort of of mac
fix+ sort of but it's just so nice it's
three dollars and it does kind of smell
like milk that sounds disgusting I know
but it kind of smells like milk but it's
really really nice and I would you
typically use my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray to set my makeup but this
is a really nice alternative just to
refresh your face and so this I like to
keep in my purse sometimes just
especially in the winter and your skin's
a little dry
tends to look a little more bland this
just kind of wakens up your makeup and
just kind of like rejuvenates it I
really recommend this I really like it
the only thing is you got to practice
with the nozzle cuz you're gonna get a
lot on your face but just let it dry
it'll dry you know it's only three
dollars what can you expect but it's a
good product I like it okay and then I
also this is what I'm wearing right now
on my nail SH and it's the Revlon
scented nail polish you guys know how I
feel about the scented nail polishes
still smells like oranges and I painted
him last night and this is in the shade
orange pop on Instagram I have a picture
of all this but yeah I'm really really I
just love the scent it I like the UM
what am i talking about the finish and I
really like the staying power and a lot
of people say that it chips but if you
use a nice base and topcoat typically it
lasts pretty well and it's nice because
it is thinner so I find that it doesn't
chip as easily when I've got a good base
and top coat on because a lot of the
thicker once it's so thick that it'll
easily get caught on something and the
whole thing will come up you know what I
mean so I really like the Revlon but I
know a lot of people don't so it's kind
of a personal preference thing okay this
I love and it's the covergirl and Olay
simply ageless concealer and it's in the
shade I corrector so it's like more of a
yellowish it's number 230 and it's just
a swirl and you swirl it I'll do a
swatch because this is amazing
it's like a very yellow tone thing but
it's so surprisingly like like it's
already blended and that's amazing it's
so surprisingly like moisturizing if
that makes sense just very emollient and
very blendable and just nice and it
stays on I haven't noticed any creasing
and it really really hides their eye
darkness I mean it's like one of the
very few products I found that I'm like
oh yeah
okay last thing this was on clearance
it's the I'm not even gonna try and save
the designers name probable guru I don't
know anyway but it's you know he did a
line for Target I'm a while back and go
and now all this stuff from on clearance
but I've had my eye on these for Oh ever
they're these really really cute um oh
my gosh she's so cute like mini wedges
sort of and it's got this thick ankle
strap and the cute little strap here
surprisingly comfortable and that is the
truth surprisingly comfortable
and these were on clearance for only 898
holla I was just like so ecstatic they
zip up the back and they are just so
cute they're gonna look so cute with
like jean shorts like on the 4th of July
or like white skinny capris oh or even
like a black dress like these are so
cute they can be dressy and they can be
just summery it's so it's such a nice
mix so I really really like these all of
his shoes are on clearance and a lot of
them are really cute there was some
really cute black strappy once I almost
bought and then I didn't because I
already have like two black strappy
heels I don't need anymore
love these recommend them super
comfortable and I think that is all hope
you've enjoyed subscribe if you liked it
