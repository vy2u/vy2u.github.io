gonna share with you why I have
completely decluttered in my collection
I've had a lot of comments asking you
know mostly positive but a few kind of
negative saying Jessica I don't get it
like why would you get rid of like 80%
of your makeup collection and so if you
haven't seen I've started a declutter
series that I'm calling curating my
collection so the definition of curate
is to select organize and look after the
items in a collection or an exhibition
so like in a museum there's a curator an
art curator well I really wanted to be
very selective about the makeup that's
in my personal collection I'm not a
makeup artist I don't have a separate
thing that I use for clients because I
don't have clients I'm just a normal
person with a job and you know a house
payment and a husband and now we've got
a baby on the way and a dog I'm a normal
person and so for me while I do have
this part of me that has YouTube and
reviewing makeup as a job I've gotten to
the point where I felt so overwhelmed by
what I had that I felt like I couldn't
even do my job properly because I was
drowning in palettes and lipsticks and
while that is an amazing problem to have
and I want to start this video by
reminding you know I'm not complaining
about the amount of makeup that I am
sent I'm not I love that part of my job
I love makeup that's why I started this
channel in the first place when it
wasn't a job at all but for me to still
enjoy this and be able to feel like I
really am giving you my true full
thoughts on products I knew that I had
to get rid of a lot and basically the
new system I've created is where I've
curated my collection down so much that
my my best example because it's always
in my head is you know I started with 60
or 70 primers and I ended up with like
eight primers and I got rid of all the
rest so I donated what I could gave to
my sister's friends co-workers all the
rest that part of me feels really good
about that because hey I know that these
primers even once that I loved if I have
three primers that do the same thing
well I don't need three primers that do
the same thing
one because reality is even with eight
primers I'm not gonna go through all of
those before they expire so it felt
really selfish to me for me to keep 70
primers that I knew we're just gonna go
bad and that would need to be thrown
away because I don't want to pass on
expired makeup to anyone you know so
with that in mind it was a good feeling
to get rid of just you know for myself
but also an even better feeling knowing
that these products whether they were
terrible products or amazing products
some of them I've even like featured
recently in videos if I have three of
them that I'll do the same thing I'm
gonna pick one and get rid of the rest
so someone else can enjoy them whether
that's someone you know in a battered
women's shelter or whether that's my
sister that I knew had their eye on it
or a friend coworker etc so that part of
it felt good but now I've gotten in my
other drawers I have a curated
collection of products I freaking love I
freaking love so that alone makes
getting ready in the morning so much fun
because I open the drawer and I'm like
oh my gosh these are all my favorite
setting sprays and there's only a couple
oh my gosh these are my favorite
foundations now does it mean that I only
have two foundations no I still have
like 10 to 12 foundations and does that
mean that's all I'm ever gonna have of
course not because then I wouldn't be
able to do my job so my new system is
that I have my what was my everyday
makeup drawer I'm still calling it that
but that's where I'm gonna be putting
new products I'm trying out so it's kind
of like the buffer zone the holding come
like purgatory it's the purgatory for
makeup that I'm trying out right now but
I haven't yet decided do I love it
enough to have it in my curated personal
collection or do I need more time with
it if I need more time it stays in there
or do I absolutely hate it in which case
I'll move it to my regrets bin that I
just have in my closet so that I can
talk about it in a review or a best and
worst video or a you know product
regrets video whatever it might be it's
a system that's working for me and if
you're another youtuber or blogger
whatever you do you know a lot of makeup
reviews specifically it's it's been
actually really helpful because then I
can delineate between
the what I had done before was I would
get let's say six new bronzers you know
from maybe vary Springs some of them I
bought some of them are sent to me well
I would put all of those in my bronzer
George maybe I'd put one of my every day
makeup drawer well half of them I
wouldn't even try because I'd forget
that they were even there because they
were swimming in a drawer with you know
30 other bronzers and then some I would
try a little more and maybe I'd find one
I liked but it just felt so random like
I didn't feel like I had a system where
I could genuinely be trying these
products and really really know how I
felt because of the sheer amount of
makeup that I had at any given time that
I really hadn't tried and I would feel
like I would open my foundation drawer
and I'd be like I feel like there are 15
foundations in here that I really don't
know how I feel about them
I just haven't tried them enough and so
the other part of my system is I have a
drawer too over here oops because now I
have a lot of empty drawers because I've
gotten rid of so much I have one or two
drawers over here where I'm keeping
brand new products that I have an
interest in trying if I have no interest
in trying it I'm getting rid of it I'm
passing it on right away because I used
to keep all of that just in case well if
I had no interest in trying it I never
had an interest and I always ended up
letting it sit there so I'd rather just
not even mess with it if I know that it
is not at my alley at all and you guys
haven't asked me to review it then it's
gone but if I have an interest in trying
it but I know that okay I'm already
trying out a lot right now I'll put it
in one of these drawers it'll sit there
unopened in its packaging until I'm like
okay I'm ready to kind of turn things
over let me clear this drawer out and
decide what do I want to keep what it
was a regret and then move some new
products into it and because of that
kind of 3-step system I feel that much
more organized and I feel like I'm even
more obsessed with makeup than I was
before and it's funny because I have so
much less one fear I always have
I've watched youtubers to clutter like
crazy kind of like I did and one fear I
personally had had was well how are they
gonna like recommend products they only
have like you know six blushes like what
are you gonna do the reality is while I
may have way less right now I know that
I'm still going to be getting more and
more product
in but I want to be more conscious about
what I'm keeping and not just collecting
to collect and have a full bronzer join
a fool right now my blushes bronzers and
highlights are all in one drawer and
there's still plenty of room because I
got rid of so much and they're my
favorites and so I feel like I hope that
you're not nervous that oh no she got
rid of all this so she's gonna be
recommending the same things over and
over again it's not gonna be that way
I'm still gonna be trying out more so
I'm hoping with this new system that
I'll be able to give you more
recommendations because I am actually
truly putting them to the test and not
you know maybe trying it here there but
never really fully developing an opinion
just feeling like oh yeah it's pigmented
and it's okay does that make sense I
guess what I'm saying is I'm trying to
improve myself and improve what I do
here on my channel and this is the way
that I need to do it and like thinking
about just lipsticks the lipstick I'm
wearing today I have one bright pink
lipstick and this is it period is this
bareMinerals one in alpha whereas before
I had a ton and it's like well why I
don't even wear bright pink very often
why do I need any more than one now does
that mean I'm always only gonna have one
bright pink lipstick no I might have a
couple but I want the freedom to be able
to really be picky about those things
because that's my job when I first
started watching YouTube
I was watching because I was trying to
find those Holy Grail items that are
just unbelievable you know I wanted to
find the one lipstick that Trump's them
all I wanted to find the one foundation
that makes your skin look perfect but
doesn't look like foundation I wanted to
find the one powder that makes your skin
look perfect but doesn't look dry and so
since I feel like we are all kind of in
pursuit of those unbelievable products
why am I wasting my time with these
mediocre products that are just sitting
in my drawer and I'm forcing myself to
use them because I don't want to go back
why I'd rather be using all of those
products I love and trying new products
then wasting my time with these medium
products that are just kind of like the
other good but there's a million things
like it so I hope that I'm making some
semblance of sense at the end of the day
and I wrote this in a pinned comment on
my primer declutter because I was
getting those kinds of questions that
were understandable but at the end of
the day my job on YouTube is not to have
a huge collection of makeup it's not
that doesn't help me do my job any
better
my job is to review products and so this
is the way I'm doing it and this is the
way that's working for me so far and I
think that we lose sight of that when we
watch youtubers that have huge
collections I mean I myself have had a
huge collection I still have a big
collection but I think there's something
to be said about the simplicity of
having less and just being able to
really focus on those products you love
slash the new ones I'm trying out one
example I gave because I know some
people were upset and again totally
understandable because like in my primer
declutter for example there is this
Physicians Formula primer it was their
spotlight primer I freaking love that
primer but I shared it in a dupes video
very very recently because it is an
exact dupe for the hourglass backlight
priming filter I love both so much I
bought both with my own money neither
one of them were PR so with that in mind
when I'm looking at both primers and I
know that even with my eight primers I'm
keeping I'm not gonna use them all up
before I before they go bad when I look
at both and I'm gonna keep one or the
other because I know I don't need both
I'm gonna keep the one I spent more
money on wouldn't you I mean it was my
money and I'm like yes they're the same
I've already done my job in sharing with
you guys in that dupes video that
absolutely they are the same so there's
no reason for me to hold on to it I
already have that knowledge to be able
to share with you guys and what I keep
doesn't affect you guys does that make
sense it doesn't affect you in that way
that it's what you're using and so I
know a lot of years for like what you
just talked about that primer and there
were other ones too you just talked
about it so I went out buy it now I feel
like you're lying to me and you don't
actually like I'm like no I can still
love something it doesn't negate my
review to get rid of something
especially when I was trying to share in
that video and I was trying to get
through a ton of primers so there was
only so much time but you know trying to
share in they're like no I do love this
but I don't need both that kind of
mentality and like I said in the pin
comment if I were to keep all of just
the primers that I genuinely loved I
would have over 20 primers that's still
way too many they're gonna go bad
don't need 20 primers I already have a
knowledge up here of what I like and
what I would recommend and so keeping 20
primers doesn't help me do that part of
my job especially if I've already talked
about these in videos like dupes videos
etc so again I hope this made some
semblance of sense I hope that you can
understand my mentality
I hope I'm inspiring some of you guys to
live with less to get rid of some of
your stuff to be pickier about what you
buy what you keep I just think as the
whole we all need to be pickier because
we buy so much stuff we buy it because
it's on clearance and of course I'm
saying that I'm literally wearing
clearance earrings I bought from Target
but I love to them we buy so much and we
really don't need much you know we
really just don't and there's this
liberating feeling I felt with this
smaller collection that I can't describe
I can't um it's the same feeling I got
when I like to cluttered my closet and
got rid of like you know 70% of it and
really kept only what I loved it's an
amazing feeling so I hope it's inspired
you I hope that this made sense and I
hope you'll catch more of my declutter
zazz I kind of curate my collection even
more and I've got the whole thing is
filmed I filmed every single category
it's just I've pre filmed them all and
it'll just go up you know kind of
intermittently between other videos so
stay tuned definitely subscribe if you
want to catch more of them and other
than that I will see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
