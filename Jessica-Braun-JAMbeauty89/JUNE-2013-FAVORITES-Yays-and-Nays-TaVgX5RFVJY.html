have my June favorites and Naver it's or
maybe I'm gonna call it like faves and
names
naves is in like yay or nay maybe I
should call it yeas and nays I don't
know we'll see what I end up calling
this video I'm just being ridiculous
okay so it's basically July this is also
um so I have some absolute favorites
that I've discovered and some things
that I'm like woman and I spent the
money on this so here we go okay one
favorite that I've been loving I have
two nail polishes this Essie nail polish
it's in the color watermelon and I have
it on my toes and I have it on my nails
in the past few videos I love it it's
like here's the thing red nail polish
I've never found one that I've liked
genuinely light and this one is not
quite red but it's pretty close and so I
think this is for me the closest thing
I'll get to red that I actually like and
it looks really really nice on toes it's
a it's a nice alternative to the kind of
neon colors which I usually wear you
know like nice bright corals and things
like that are usually what I put on my
toes but this is kind of a nice switch
up and it's a little more grown-up and I
really like it I mean also put neon
colors on my toes but you know what I'm
saying
really really like this so SC watermelon
go snag it okay another one I just
recently got and it's on my nails right
now is this Orly nail polish and
lollipop this was my first Orly nail
polish I got it for like 50% off and I
really like the formula I was so
pleasantly surprised now I did do two
coats of it but I really liked it and so
now I want to go back and see if I can
find more 50% off even though it's been
a while now but um I really like it and
I really really like this lavender color
it's just really pretty
okay so another favorite has been this
Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer it's in the
shade warm tan gosh like I never thought
I would like a cream bronzer honestly
and I really really do what I do is I
take a stipple brush this is the elf
small stipple brush you just stipple it
in and then you can just stipple it on
you know
I mean and it's just a really nice color
I haven't used it like you know bronzing
up there I've really just used it for
contouring but I really really like it
just a lot oh man I really really like
it okay so something I have not been
loving is this NYC curling brush mascara
and city curls I've mentioned it before
my sister gave it to me because she
didn't like it and I figured I'd give it
a try the brush looks like this it's
curved it's just way too much work it's
like two or three dollars so it's
inexpensive but for a couple dollars
more you can get fantastic mascaras so
you know why waste three dollars and you
could spend five or six and get one
that's way better because this you have
to put like four layers on and it still
it gets everywhere like it's just one of
those mascaras it's just not worth your
time and your money just know just know
Oh anyway
favorite of mine this is a rediscovered
is the L'Oreal infallible shadows I only
own one and it was because they're kind
of expensive for what they are and I
bought the shade iced latte
and I talked about how this is a really
nice dupe for Stila kitten and it comes
with this little thing that you take out
because it really is a pressed pigment
and what I like to apply this with is a
sponge applicator we never use these do
we I know right like I just throw a
little way like if they're know I hate
up but for things like this fantastic
because they can really pack on like
especially for like your I'm going to
show you for your like lid so it really
can just pack on that color I think
better than most regular eyeshadow
brushes do I want to get more colors
there's one that there's like a pink one
that I really really want so I'm waiting
for a good 50% off sale or like coupons
and things you know you know how I roll
come on um okay so something I have not
been loving has been now I love me some
NYX jumbo eye pencils however this shade
is horrible and I will tell you why
it's in the shade Sparkle nude and I
thought beautiful it's gonna be shimmery
it's gonna be like a nude like champagne
color yeah sure it's that color I need
to sharpen it but it leaves behind it is
a beautiful color but it leaves behind
actual sparkles no no no no no like
because the thing about these the way I
use them I'll put them on like my lid
kind of as a base sometimes and then
I'll kind of blend it out a little bit
and then put shadow on top and that
glitter those little sparkles is getting
me everywhere it's horrible oh my gosh
and so one that's a good alternative is
in the shade cashmere it's a very
similar color but it doesn't have the
sparkles and that's one of my favorites
but sparkle nude stay away unless you
want glitter everywhere stay away from
it
so a new favorite of mine is this
L'Oreal what did they call it does it
actually say in here it's part of their
like I think it's their like color
caress it's like the lip gloss that they
have that's like a gloss but it like
kind of dries I don't know how to
describe it but I have it in the color
pink perseverance and it's just like a
baby pink it's kind of a doe foot
applicator but it's a little bit
different than what I'm used to and then
it's just like a kind of a sheer wash of
pink which I've really been loving
lately but it dries on your lips but it
still looks glossy and it doesn't feel
weird and dry it's really bizarre I've
never owned anything like this but I
love it so I'm cleaning on yet again oh
gosh I need like a L'Oreal so because
both of these things I want more of in
there both L'Oreal so yes I want to get
a bunch more shades if you have a
favorite shade of this or a favorite
shade of these please let me know down
below because I will be looking out for
those another favorite is this vital
care vitamin E cream I've been using
this since Christmas and it's really
really inexpensive you can find them
online or at Big Lots if you have one
near you like I said it's the brand
vital care it's their vitamin E cream
and it has vitamins A D and E
it has in antioxidants you know I I
don't know that much about like you know
what I mean ingredients but I know how
this has been performing on my skin and
my skin I can't like cry because my I
had so much like hyperpigmentation I was
breaking out all the time last year
and it was driving me nuts and I'm like
gosh is that the Foundation's I'm using
and so I would kind of do tests and like
not use the foundation you know what I
mean we all do like scientific
experiments with our faces I know we do
especially what a breakouts involved but
this stuff like I started using more
gentle face washes and then I started
moisturizing with this I haven't had any
dry skin on my face I used to in the
winter it'd be terrible like right here
there'd be just like dry patches you
know what I mean and so no matter what
you'd put on your face after a while you
know you can see that dry skin peeping
through I started using this and after
about a week I have not had dry skin on
my face anywhere and I feel like even
the oiliness has been a little bit more
controlled I feel like it's really
balanced my skin out and it's back to
the way it should be
you know what I mean so I can't
recommend this enough it's huge
and what I do I mean this I've been
using this since December and it's still
like films like here I use it morning
before I do my makeup and night before
bed and I do pot it into a little thing
that way I don't have to have this in my
vanity taking up space and that way I
can keep like this in my bathroom and
this will actually I keep this in my
nightstand I'm being honest and then
this like with me and plus I can take it
with me when I travel so I really like
little containers like this if you ever
find you know you can buy these online I
found them in a store in your meat
called Meijer
by just a million because sometimes
they're hard to find and they have so
many uses okay so another thing I'm
loving my wet wild cover all foundation
I love it so much and it's 399 you guys
if you're looking for just a good I
would say medium coverage foundation
this is great and you can really work it
up to full I have it in the shade
everyone asked 816 which is fair / light
I applied with my Beauty Blender like I
do most foundations and it's just
beautiful it's a beautiful thinner
it's not too oily it's not too drying
especially if you kind of have now I
have pretty much normal skin it's not
too oily and it's definitely not dry so
this is really nice on my skin it wears
well throughout the day it doesn't melt
off I'll go on runs outside and then
come back and my skin still looks great
so I love it
one thing I'm hating I now here's the
thing I got this like 75% off I should
have known that it would be bad I don't
know it's the all day I of course don't
know what it's called but it's for the
it's in the for brown eyes something and
it's like the dual-ended little like
shadow sticks and so it has this green
and this cream let me just show you how
non-pigmented this is I gotta find like
a clean spot I'll do it on this hand so
this is a swatch you guys are not even
gonna believe this there's like nothing
on my skin do you see anything it's like
barely there no yes I'm pale and this is
almost the color of my skin but there's
like nothing there there's a little bit
of shimmer now I guess this might be
okay for like a day I wonder how much is
even in here I'm gonna roll it and
that's all that it comes with anyway
like what so the green one I'm thinking
well maybe the green will be a little
bit more pigmented not really let's see
here okay that is after rubbing it back
and forth now of course now it looks
incredibly feminine first of all it
looks blue it's probably looking green
on there in person it literally looks
absolutely blue which is fine except for
I wanted the green and it's just weird
and like patchy and it has a little bit
of pigmentation than this but I mean if
it's right to the pricier you do not
spend the money at least not on this one
because it I mean and frankly I don't I
just no thanks no thanks all me and
that's the thing about all made for me
like their mascaras I like and I use
like their eye makeup remover things but
other than that I really don't use much
all May so if you have any all my
products that you absolutely love oh
there are new lip glosses I like that's
one thing I'll admit that but if you
have any all my products you love please
comment down below because I would love
to try more but every time I'm looking
at this
I'm like mm you know like there's not
really that much that I love so um yeah
that those are my June favorites I keep
wanting to say may favorites my June
