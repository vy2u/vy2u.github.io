have my January favorites and this month
has been an absolutely awesome month it
was my birthday month and I'm 25 and
loving it and I'm just really excited i
discovered some wonderful products that
I've like never used but I'd heard good
things about or just products I've never
used and I just tried on a whim and I
love them and it's a really solid mix of
drug store and some that are a little
bit more high end but I have some tips
on how to get them for really cheap
because you know I'm always trying to
get stuff really trade okay so I'm gonna
start with like a rando one this
hairspray is awesome it's the Dove style
and care flexible hold hairspray and
it's like three four dollars at anywhere
I mean literally anywhere target Walmart
wherever I love it it has kind of a
smell that like grew on me it's almost
like coconutty um I don't really know
how to describe the smell but it smells
nice I think but um it this there's
something about this it's like an odd I
don't know how to describe this is the
most flexible hold I've ever had where
it'll completely d phrase my hair
whether it's like little things up here
or just you know how it will get kind of
weird it'll d frizz it and it smells
nice and you can't feel it it literally
doesn't feel like there's anything
you're here but it doesn't make it
greasy either it's the best mixture I've
ever ever ever tried in a hairspray I've
never tried anything like this and it's
cute because it's got some bacon but I
love it it's so cheap and I used to be
obsessed with the Bed Head masterpiece
hairspray and that one was great because
of his it had a good smell and it really
didn't feel like anything was in there
but it d frizz this does the same thing
has a different smell it does the same
thing and it's like four dollars versus
like the other ones like twenty dollars
so i love this stuff i had to show that
with you guys okay another thing i've
been using a lot and I'm i hate that i
like it it's the josie maran of just her
pure argan oil and this is like one of
the small little point five fluid ounces
bottles but it's really expensive and so
I'm like dang it why do I have to like
it and I was using it alone and now I've
been mixing it with
this moisturizer i'm using right now
it's the Clinique dramatically different
moisturizing gel I don't love this or
hate I I guess I really don't know how I
feel about it yet but I've been mixing
these and I like it a little bit better
and I really you can use this alone you
can mix it you can even mix it with your
foundation I mean you can do whatever
you want with it but I really really
like it and I use such a tiny amount and
it's already almost halfway gone I'm
like now and I want to buy another one
but I love it and I've also been using I
don't have it with me but the josie
maran cleansing oil I love that stuff
too and it smells so good that one I I'm
just gonna have to buy these you guys I
want to actually buy them anyway okay so
onto the makeup goodies I'm excited one
of my rediscovered favorites is the wet
and wild coverall foundation this stuff
is 399 anywhere and I where I think this
is the lightest shade it's 816 fair /
light a lot of people ask me that's the
shade I wear I'm wearing this today and
I have been wearing it a lot lately
because I was like gosh I feel like a
lot of the foundations I have right now
are too dark for me just period i'm
literally the dead middle of winter and
it's where literally the city is shut
down today at least the day that I'm
filming this the city the mayor's shut
the city down so like everything's
closed schools are closed i was supposed
to be at school today and it's just
clothes just because it's cold it's not
even like snowy blizzardy it's just like
negative 15 degrees out here so I'm
cooped up I've been cooped up for far
too long anyway what does that to do
with this I don't even know oh cuz im so
pale this i I just love this stuff I
think it has really nice coverage I
would say it's medium coverage you could
build it up to be full coverage I have
been applying this with the Sigma f80
brush now this one I go back and forth
with because i really like it but i also
really like the beauty blender but i've
been using this a lot lately because i
haven't felt like going all of it in my
bathroom to wet the beauty blender and
then cleaning it afterwards i'm really
bad about this brush really is awesome
and with this is my favorite way to
apply this foundation is with this brush
and even though it's pricey to buy it
just separately you can buy them in kits
but this if you're only going to buy one
brush from sigma this should be the one
it and you hear about it all the time
but this
there's a good reason it there's
something about the density of the brush
and how it just applies it since these
are synthetic it doesn't soak up the
product therefore any product that
you're whether you have it on your hand
or it's already on your face you put it
on here it's all going into your skin
which is so nice that means it's not
just it's so hard to describe if you're
looking for a brush to apply foundation
you really haven't found the one you
like and you're spending three dollars
here four dollars there on cheaper
brushes and you're not loving any of
them stop spending a bunch of a few
dollars here and there and just put it
all together and buy this because it's
worth it i promise i'll link it below if
you're interested it is worth every
penny it's all say love these so another
product i've been loving i'm wearing on
my lips right now it's the Milani
raspberry rush and actually my boyfriend
recently got this for me we were at the
store actually on my birthday and I was
like I want this it's so pretty and of
course it's not coming across the same
way on the camera this is like a it
literally has a blue sheen to it I think
it is look such a fun pretty color it's
a deeper raspberry color like I said
it's just not coming across on the
camera I wish it was but I really really
like it it doesn't make your teeth look
yellow milani lipsticks around five six
dollars they're not super expensive they
do have a watermelon II smell so if you
don't like that which I'm not that big
of a fan of you might not like it but
honestly once you've applied it after
about a minute you really don't smell it
so I don't think it's that bad but i
love how blue toned it is i don't have
many like this actually I don't have any
like this so I I was really excited
about and I really like it and I think
it wears off really well I mean nicely
okay another thing that I have been
loving is this elf zit zapper if you
don't own one of these you've got to run
out to target or wherever and get it
they're a dollar and it's literally just
salicylic acid so if your skin doesn't
react well to that I obviously don't get
it but I actually have a breakout right
here you can probably see it I didn't
worry about covering it up too much but
it's got a rollerball at the top and you
just you know you just rollerball it on
so after I wash my face if I have any
blemishes or break
I'll just put this on at night or even
in the morning before I apply my makeup
and it's just working to combat that
spot and it's really nice it dries it up
pretty quickly within a few days it's
gone so I really really do like this and
it's so inexpensive you can travel with
it I my boyfriend even has what I bought
him and he loves it I think they're
great okay another eye shadow okay I
have quite a few eye shadows to show you
guys that either I rediscovered or I
just loved one thing that I recently got
was the Naked basics palette and it took
me forever to get it because I was just
like I don't think I need it or want it
but I eventually did and I love this
color year i think it's just called
naked too yeah i love it because for
someone my skin tone it's the perfect
crease color it really is I think if
you're a darker skin gal that might
actually be a nice mixing color and
frankly if you're darker skin then faint
will be a perfect crease color for you I
think this is such a nice compact
perfect for travel palette and I think
the colors are beautiful it's you know
they're all so buttery it's got their
own mat I mean if this is a wonderful
wonderful palette and every time I use
it I fall a little bit more in love with
it so if you're kind of on the fence
just do it you're gonna love it I
promise okay I'm jumping around here
another brush I'm loving is this elf
stipple brush this has been all i have
been using on my cheeks lately i've been
using it to apply my powder blush my
cream blush i'll even dip it in like
highlight and just put it straight up
all over the blush and it looks so do ii
and radiant it applies the perfect
amount of product even if it's a really
pigmented blush and you're like dang and
you you know you might want to dab a
little bit of it off but it just applies
so nicely because it's so much thinner
there at the top and it's so soft these
are three dollars on elfs website or at
target wherever I need to buy more of
these because I I can't stop using this
I love it so much another thing that I
you know that i love is this Rimmel
scandaleyes mascara this is my favorite
mascara at the moment and I don't know
what it is it just wears on my lashes
the same as when I apply it
that made any sense and i think the
brush is so fun and i don't know there's
something about this that it keeps the
curl it's really black i like the way
the brush applies it it doesn't clump
for me it's ideal I mean that's what I
want in a mascara and I just if you can
find it in stores it's like four or five
bucks buy it I think you'll like it I
know that some people i think if you
have absolutely really sparse lashes you
might not like it but i think if you
kind of have just not normal if you will
not normal but if you have kind of a
decent amount of lashes I think you'll
really like it because it's the perfect
everyday mascara now it's not like
VaVaVoom like crazy crazy volume but I
think it's really is perfect for
everyday and you don't have to worry
about it clumping or wearing off weird
it's just really nice a high-end product
that I have fallen in love with is this
mac prolongwear concealer this is
absolutely pro longwear it stays on all
day it just melts into your skin and if
you've got really really dark circles I
think you're really going to like this
of course it is pricier I think it's
around $18 or so but it's worth it it
comes with a pretty solid amount of
product the only downside is it the pump
you cannot control how much it comes out
so I feel like I could use a third of
what is pumped out so so much is wasted
so I think what I might start doing is
every time I pump some out I'll just I
don't know I gotta figure something out
maybe I'll save the rest somehow because
i feel like i'm wasting so much it
drives me nuts and then I'm just like
I've heard people use this just straight
up all over like as foundation you could
probably mix it with a moisturizer and
put it on all over it really is amazing
amazing product so I I now understand
all the hype behind it and i am glad i
bought it because on those days that i
have really bad blemishes are really bad
dark circles it is a lifesaver so it's
you know you don't have to use it
everyday if you spend that much money
and you don't want it to run out that
quickly use it when you truly need it
and then use other concealers when you
don't you know okay Lou it Cheetos I
feel like I got a lot of favorites i'm
sorry you guys well it's not a bad thing
but this coming a long video i know how
much by the way my necklace if you're
wondering
or if you even knew it was a necklace
and almost it almost looks like it's
like part of my shirt I wish this
necklace is so cute i got it from shop
lately calm which i'll link below it has
been one of my ever since i started
youtube i've always talked about i used
to talk about all the time that i've
tried to like quiet down because i
talked about it all the time but they
have the cutest accessories and jewelry
and for the most part they're all really
well-made no so cheap i think i got this
for like seven dollars it they're all
amazing they are just amazing so
definitely check them out if you're
wanting like those fun statement
necklaces or funky earrings but you
don't want to spend like 20 25 forty
dollars on them like some people do it's
really they really are great deals and
they're just all I love that company
okay another thing that I just love is
the maybelline dream lumi concealer I
get it in the brightener shade it's
called radiant and it's a pink toned I'm
sorry my nose is like crazy itchy what's
happening to me who it's like a pink
toned of concealer if you will but the
thing about it can you even see it I
don't even know if you can see it it
really is like a salmon almost but
what's so amazing about it is that it
melts into the skin so beautifully if
you pair these two together it's like
literally impeccable under there this
will conceal your dark circles this will
just brighten it in the most beautiful
way now I think if you're really dark
skinned this might be way too light for
you so you might they have concealer
shades that are darker that if you find
one that's just a little bit lighter
than your skin tone then it might be
perfect as a brightener but i love the
formula of this more than anything and I
there you know five or six dollars from
Maybelline and I just think they it
might be one of my all-time favorite
favorite favorite products I'd
repurchase this more than once I love it
and I go through it like that another
thing that I have I just love this it's
the benefit cream creaseless cream
shadow in RSVP this is just a little
trial size but it's the most beautiful I
got it all in my nail beautiful
beautiful color I love the formula of
this it's so much creamier than most
cream shadows I
say the Sigma cream shadows that I also
do love are thicker so if you want more
of a thicker one that's gonna really
hold on to anything you put on top of it
you'll want a sigma one but if you like
the creamier ones especially if you're
just gonna like wear it alone I would go
with the benefit I think they're of
course pricier but this is so just
simple iridescent I can just put it all
over my lids and just leave and it's
just perfect it is the perfect shade and
they of course have a wide shade range
as well another product that I fell in
love with I'm wearing it in my brows
right now is this Milani easy brow and I
haven't the shade natural taupe now I do
think that this pulls a little bit red
for my taste I have a million swatch
straight there I think it pulls a little
bit red but frankly my hair has a little
bit of red in it some people think that
I have red hair which kind of blows my
mind so it doesn't bother me as much
anymore as I've got more and more used
to it but what I love is a formula of
this I might try a different shade as
well but it's so it glides on so smooth
the spoolie on the back is so perfect
for brushing through and really kind of
spreading out that color so it looks
more evenly distributed where you want
it and I just think there's it's called
the easy bro it's just so easy to work
with and they have a decent amount of
color it's not a ton but it's not only
like two colors you know so I really
like them they're really inexpensive and
I I probably will repurchase it and I
probably will try another color as well
alright so this I have too many shadows
to show you the Urban Decay half-baked I
think this is the old packaging I got
this from Instagram I had recently had
an Instagram sale on all my things that
I decluttered if you saw my latest blog
where I decluttered like my makeup
collection well I had the sale before i
even posted that video but and it did
really well and it's just so cool to be
able to i don't know it's a it's just a
cool way to interact with you guys
because how i don't know i don't even
know what i'm talking bout anymore but
then i started like getting into this
whole world of instagram sales and
seeing other people that are selling
makeup on there and this one woman had a
ton of these urban decay shadows that
were brand new and she was selling half
baked for like this was like four
dollars shift like that was all i paid
and so i got this in
I already have half baked in both of the
naked the original naked palette and the
Naked 2 palette but it's my favorite in
them and I thought when I'm traveling
and I don't want to bring the Naked
palette this is perfect i can still
bring half-baked which is my favorite
shadow like in the universe but not have
to worry about bringing that huge clunky
thing I can just bring this so I thought
yeah four dollars a totally worth it so
definitely go to Instagram see if you
can find like usually there's an account
called makeup exchange and she reposts
what a bunch of other people are selling
and then I found a bunch of other
sellers through that that I would follow
that way I could just see when there's
really great deals lots of mac limited
edition stuff and other mac products so
definitely go to Instagram check it out
who knew that world existed right love
it so another favorite is this Real
Techniques brush if you don't know Real
Techniques was started by Samantha
Chapman who was I think her name on
youtube is Pixiwoo or pixi 20 or
something like that I should really know
that but she has her own company brushes
and they're all amazing absolutely
amazing this is one of my favorites it's
called the dual fiber I brush and its
really really small and it's dirty but
what I like about it is that the shape
of it is so perfect and again it's that
duo fiber just like the stipple brush
from ELF that I love it applies just the
right amount and I use this in my crease
all the time with like a lighter
sometimes I'll use it with the naked to
shade from the basics palette I'll just
use that and I can just sweep it through
I don't have to be exactly precise I can
just kind of be messy with it and it
still deposits it exactly how I want it
so I really really like this brush and
the last thing that I will talk about I
could go on for days is my Shady Lady
Vol I don't know what volume this is if
you know let me know there's like three
or four volumes of the Shady Lady
pallets these are from the bomb now
these are freaking expensive when you
just buy them straight up however on
hautelook calm and i'll link that below
as well i always buy my products from
the bomb whether it be blushes or
anything like that i always always
always buy them from hautelook because
they're not on there all the time it's a
flash sale site but when they are gosh
what's wrong with my nose when they are
on there the blushes are ten dollars
instead of like 25 I'm making up prices
but it's way way way way way way way
cheaper in fact that's where I get a lot
of my high end makeup so if you ever
curious like how can you afford that you
don't make any money that is how it's
usually from hautelook so definitely go
check it out towards that they also have
clothes and boots and insane deal insane
deals on designer stuff for real anyway
this is one of my favorite palettes and
I always it cut has a huge mirror in it
and then it comes with nine shadows and
they have a bunch of different volumes
but these shadows are I'm actually
wearing these today I'm wearing this
purple one it's blended out but curvy
cami is what it's called I'm wearing
that one kind of my outer corner
increase and it's one of my favorites so
are my gosh all of these oh my gosh look
at those these are so gorgeous you can
do neutral lips with it you can do crazy
fun looks a lot of them are great liner
colors um they're just absolutely
stunning here's a swatch of them they're
just so beautiful they blend so
seamlessly it is I really think this is
my favorite palette and I always forget
about it but then when I pull it back
out of one oh my gosh okay so a few
other things that I have been loving
this candle from target it's the scent i
almost said the shade no dissent sugar
blossom now i know a lot of people love
the sweet spun sugar and I like that one
but this one just feels a little bit
more grown up to me and I think it I
like the scent better because it's not
quite as sweet and in your face but it
still is really really sweet but it's a
little bit musky I love this smell and I
do like it better than that although I
like both but in of course it's just
cute this is the smaller one for five
dollars the bigger ones are 10 right
does that sound right I love them and
they really do smell so strongly they
have a good set throw is that the
descent throw you know what I mean the
scent throw goes really am I talking
about I love this candle that is what
I'm trying to say i also have been
loving this jr watkins pain-relieving
lyneham its prey now my legs get really
sore because I run and I used to use
what's that called like any of like
bengay or any of those muscle relaxing
creams you know just like icy hot is
usually actually going to use but I hate
getting it all of my hands and this is a
spray it has menthol and camphor in it
and it just feels nice I'll spray it on
my knees and my calves which is usually
where I'm sore and I don't have to rub
it in i kind of like let it dry for a
sec before I like lay down but i usually
use it right before bed and it just
feels so good and I'll go to bed and
they're still feeling really nice I
think I got this my mom bought this
actually at cracker barrel if you have
one of those near you but you know where
anywhere they sell jr watkins they might
sell this and i'm sure you can get it
online i really really like it so those
are all my favorites i hope that you may
be found a new product that maybe you
want to try out let me know what some of
your favorites were down below I'm
especially looking for a new facial
moisturizer so let me know maybe a
moisturizer that you're loving below and
I might look into it because I do need a
new one soon and I'll catch you guys
very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
