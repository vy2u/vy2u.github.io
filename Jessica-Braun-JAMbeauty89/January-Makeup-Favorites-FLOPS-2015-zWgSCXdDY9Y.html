got my January favorites but I also have
some products that I didn't like and I
don't always include those products I
didn't like but this month there are a
few things I bought that I don't know I
just thought to myself these socks so I
want to tell you guys about them before
we begin I'm going to tell you what's on
my lips because i always have questions
about it and I know I'm terrible about
remembering to list it below and all of
you guys ask but a lot of times like
pre-record because you guys know I'm a
full-time teacher so during the week
it's really hard for me to edit and
record so i'll usually pre-record on
weekends when i can and anyway long
story short i always forget to put that
in the downbar the description so what
i'm wearing on my lips right now is from
starlooks i just got it in the starbucks
and in the shade marsala and it's one of
their lipsticks and i just think it's so
pretty and of course it's the color of
the year and very excited about that
okay so starting with some of the
products that i loved the first thing i
had to mention is the Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless foundation now this I
have in the shade 112 and I absolutely
adore the formula for this foundation it
it really does mattify your face I'm
wearing it today but it also makes it
look more satiny so it doesn't look so
mad and so flat that you look like a
porcelain doll it just it helps your
skin breathe and it looks like your skin
can breathe I just really really like
the way that it looks on my skin and I
think this is a pretty darn good shade
match for me as well so it's just across
the board a win i just wish i had a pump
or something like that now the original
fit me foundation formula not the matte
poreless but just the regular i didn't
love as much as this so just keep that
in mind if you've got normal or combo
skin I think you will like this a lot
the next product I absolutely love this
month is the co bigelow my favorite
night balm this I bought at bath and
body works for I want to say it might
have been six or seven dollars what I
love about this is that it's so freaking
moisturizing and it's called my favorite
night bone but I wear it all day long
all night long it preps your lips so
perfectly for lipstick and it just feels
nice on the lips doesn't feel sticky but
it is thicker but it's not annoyingly
think it's the
perfect lip balm for just all the time
overnight during the day it doesn't
matter it's so amazing now one of my
dad's this month was its kind of
counterpart where is it there it is and
it's the co bigelow my favorite lip balm
and this in my head is meant to be worn
during the day this has shea butter in
it and it smells really nice kind of
like a light vanilla scent and again I
bought it at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works what I
didn't like about it is that it was just
it ended up drying my lips out and it's
a little bit thinner than the night balm
which makes sense because you're
supposed to wear it during the day so it
doesn't need to I don't know regardless
I just I feel like it's drawing my lips
out more so that's why I've ended up
leaving this at home and bringing this
with me everywhere so it's kind of a
downer I might try and use it a few more
times because I do like the smell of it
but I wouldn't recommend it if you're
going to get one or the other get this
and a lot of times they have like buy
one get one half off and I would say
just get two of these that's what I wish
I would have done but oh well okay so
now I've got two different products that
I have hit pan on and just recently I
hit pan on both and went especially on
this one I'm about to show you next I
couldn't believe I'd already get paint
on it but I love this product it is the
pixi subtly Sun touched bronzer and it's
a really really light grey tone bronzer
you can see I hit pan on it there what I
love about this is that it is that gray
tone so it's really good for contouring
I used it today just as a kind of a
light contour you could use it to bronze
up your face but it's such a perfect
contour color that that's how I end up
using it and the one downside is that it
is kind of pricey for what it is Pixies
kind of pricey at target but it's really
really good and I have a feeling when I
run out of this I might buy it again
anyway because I I don't know like I
love my Kevin tequan one you guys know
that's like a holy grail but it's so
expensive so I don't like to use it
every day and so this is the one I end
up get going for and I end up loving
this just as much and I think I forget
about it so easily and i don't know why
so definitely recommend if you are as
fair as i am and it's really hard to
find a bronzer ish type product that
doesn't turn red you will love this so
much the next one that i also love is my
wet and wild color
icon bronzer I haven't in the shade
reserve your cabana and of course it's
marketed as a bronzer but really it's a
highlight and what is amazing about it
is that it's just this beautiful sort of
shimmery but mostly just satin type
color and you can't really see it but
I'm wearing it today on my face and I
just love it because it is just very
subtle it doesn't look like a disco ball
on your face you can't really go wrong
with it and it also has SPF in it which
i think is kind of cool although I'm
pretty sure mine is yeah close to
expiring so I need to get a new one
however it's like 399 so it's not like
it's that big of a deal but I couldn't
believe on this big of a product I
actually hit pan on it but that just
shows how much i use it I really feel
like these are similar to the hourglass
ambient lighting highlighting powders
because they are this is so finely
milled it's so buttery and yet it
doesn't look great it's just absolutely
gorgeous if you haven't tried it go try
it it's four dollars it is four dollars
i actually just bought this wet and wild
the same type but its ticket to brazil
and it's just like a deeper bronze color
just for actually bronzing up my face so
I'm excited to give this a try
especially as we moved closer to summer
this next product I love and it's an elf
product I want it i would assume it's
like three dollars because it's part of
their studio line it's their eye
brightener and I haven't the shade buff
and this is what I use to set my under
eye I use it today and it's just such a
beautifully again finely milled loose
powder just use a fluffy brush to kind
of lay it on top of your concealer here
and it just helps to settle that
concealer it helps to just prevent that
concealer from going into fine lines now
if you've got really dry skin under your
eyes I wouldn't really recommend setting
powder like this because it's probably
at least this one kind of would make it
look dryer but if you've got normal or
you're a lot younger um either way I
think you will love this it's so amazing
I would compare it to my bare minerals
one just beautiful you guys it's a
snowstorm here right now I mean it's
like so grey out and it's not like a
pretty snowstorm like where it's sunny
in its own known
no it's like a really great depressing
feels like it's six pm and it's only
noon type of snow storm it's really yeah
okay so one product that I was not
loving is this em cosmetics what I think
it's the ya lashe gallery mascara and
you'll see that the brush is kind of
like wild in a way which I don't really
mind that kind of a brush because in my
head it usually would add a good amount
of volume and get those little hairs and
all that stuff and you guys know I'm all
about supporting fellow youtubers and I
like Michelle Phan she seems really nice
and she's absolutely gorgeous but I just
didn't like this I mean it I don't know
it like it was nothing it felt like I
was using like a two-dollar wet and wild
mascara that was really crappy that's
what I mean to be completely honest I
know that sounds really blunt but I just
didn't like it and I really had high
hopes and I think the packaging is so
cute so that was a downer but one
mascara that I would recommend that is
really good and it's like 399 is the
best / extreme from Jordana i buy mine
at walgreens it's got a brush that is
really kind of clean if you will it
hardens pretty quickly though so if
you're going to put a few layers on
which I would recommend it'll get very
voluminous but it does harden really
quickly and dry the good news there is
that it holds your curl it curl really
well but you do have to kind of work
quickly to make sure you've got enough
layers on I mean it's not that fast like
you're racing against the clock but like
for me with my L'Oreal voluminous which
I also love that I can like you know I
can wait a minute in between and then
put another layer on and it's fine I
like to actually pair these together a
lot too just because this I just love
this one too they're both so good but I
have really I forgot how good this was
so definitely check it out if you like
volume and you want your curl to stay I
mean who doesn't so it's just a really
really good mascara another favorite
this month is my Revlon Photoready ir I
have mine in the shade topaz twinkle and
it's got a cream shadow here and then
this glitter like kind of liner if you
will hear although you can use it in
many different ways the cream shadow is
absolutely beautiful I have a demo video
that I'll be putting up soon this is
what I've been wearing and
past few videos where everyone keeps
asking about what is on my leg because
it's like crazy sparkly and gorgeous
it's this it's this plus this glitter
now it is more like a liner but you can
put it all over your lid or all over
this and make it look really really
pretty and sparkly so that's what i
usually do once this has dried and it's
just so beautiful I've heard from many
people that this the color range of
these like the other ones aren't
necessarily as good but this is one of
the good ones that's the only one I've
tried and I really like topaz twinkle
and they're really wearable colors to me
so I highly recommend this could not
believe I actually liked it because
products like this I feel like I'm like
ah like I almost never like them they
seem kind of you know kitschy you know
it's just a gimmick but oh my gosh I
couldn't believe how much i love it one
of my I guess this is my third dud it's
the batiste dry shampoo I got mine for
dark and deep brown hair and this was I
was excited because i love the regular
Battiste formula however this one it's
got a hint of color and I knew that
going in and I knew some people were
saying oh my gosh it's amazing and
others were saying you're it gets color
everywhere so they won't try it because
it was at marshalls and I was going to
get a new one anyway of the Battiste
like the regular I think I get the Rose
because I like the smell so I just ran
out of breath talking about it uh so I
like I used it today I had it like I am
very careful about not getting on my
face so when I sprayed it and it wasn't
like it had no like back splash on my
face except for once I brushed it
through and like I was messed with my
air I looked at my forehead and there
was black like everywhere and luckily it
came off but uh and it gets all in your
nails and like on your hand side to wash
my hands like three times to get it off
so it's great because it doesn't have
much of a white cast it does still have
kind of an odd tint but at least it's
closer to my hair color however it's not
worth the mess I would rather just have
to brush through it a few more times
with the regular then use this so it's a
great formula and again i love the
Battiste formula it doesn't feel like
I'm wearing dry shampoo which that's why
I love it however it's just not worth
the
s of the color so i think i'm just going
to i'll use this up because i'm not
going to waste it because it is good
then i'm going to go back to my rose
scented one that has just the regular
white cast because i'm not dealing with
that kind of mess so those were all of
my favorites and kind of duds for the
month of january i will link my past
monthly favorite videos down below if
you're interested and if you are
enjoying these videos please subscribe

bye so color pop let me pick out thirty
dollars worth of stuff for food which is

was able to pick what I wanted but no

wanted to show them to you guys and I
also am going to show you my eye look
that I used all the four shadows that I
have here in a second so stay tuned I
