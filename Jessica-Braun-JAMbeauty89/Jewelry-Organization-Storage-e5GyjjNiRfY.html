jewelry collection I recently did a
declutter video that I will link below
where I pulled out literally all of the
jewelry I own laid them out on my table
here and went through them one by one
and really thought about am I even
wearing this you know what I mean
he's just sitting in my collection
because I think it's pretty but I'm not
actually using it you know so I really
got rid of a lot of things and so now
this is kind of its whittled down and I
feel so much better because I'm really
only keeping the things I genuinely wear
so this jewelry box I got at Target for
$24.99 it's just three drawers and it's
mirrored on all sides so it's kind of a
pain to keep clean but so cute and it
works really well and it's perfect to
hold little things on top of like
perfume so let's go ahead and tear into
this and see how I organized it so in
this first drawer I kind of have to hold
the camera for this part because there's
no good way to get a good angle of this
top drawer so in here I just keep all of
my dainty necklaces so I like to keep
them this way where they're all the
charms are right there so I can see
exactly which one of these because if I
could only see the chain you know I've
got two silver and two gold how would I
know the difference so in plus it kind
of helps to keep them separate from each
other in a way but there's still close
enough that they're not taking up tons
of room and it works so much better than
where I used to keep them where they
were all dangling together on my little
earring tree and they would get caught
up and I would end up just wearing the
same necklace each day because it was
the one that was just in the front you
know so this is great and it's been
pretty easy to keep it this way which I
really like and then over here I've got
other like just really special things
that I don't want to get mixed in with
my other jewelry for example this is a
bracelet my mom just got me for
graduation my parents got me so that's
kept there this is this is something I
just recently got and it's by the brand
so feel I don't really know how to say
it I'll put the link below but it's
basically like a Pandora bracelet except
for it is way cheaper like insanely
cheaper and my mom has a Pandora
bracelet and I was looking she showed me
her book
because I was just kind of looking at it
and I always think about getting our
chumps but they're like 40 or $50 per
charm depending and some of them are a
little cheaper but most of them are
right around that price range and it's
just insane
but these the chumps are all like
seventeen to twenty dollars so I figured
I would set it down so I can show you
this in more detail cuz I really do love
this so I've got like my initial little
Mickey Mouse music notes I'm Irish so a
shamrock my birthstone garnet a little
princess carriage just because it
reminded me of Cinderella a cross in the
last charm it's just something I got
from a random charm bracelet I already
had but the one thing I wish I got and
I'm a moron
I knew this is all new to me so I didn't
know you had to get like little clamps
or whatever to kind of hold them in
place so they don't slide off every time
you open the bracelet so I'm gonna have
to be so careful when I take it off but
I need to get some whatever they're
called spacers or the clips but they
sell them on the site for again really
cheap so all of these are like seventeen
to twenty dollars whereas the fainter
ones are like an arm and a leg they are
stupid expensive and this these really
do feel really well-made and like I said
I was comparing to my mom's and I can't
tell the difference to be honest so I
just had to share that with you guys
because it was really is a good deal and
if you're in the market for one of these
or even if you're wanting to buy charms
for someone you could totally get them
from this site and they would fit on the
Pandora bracelet too so that's another
thought and so the last thing in this
top drawer is just a really special
pearl necklace that I got from my
boyfriend's mom for my graduation that I
adore and I love it because it's got
it's not just a plain pearl necklace it
has these little black beads on it and I
think that's just so cool because it
just makes it just that little bit
different so it's not just the plain
pearls I really really love it so those
are kind of all my special items there
in this first drawer the second drawer
is instead of being completely open
there is a divider here and on this side
I have most of my bracelets so I really
only kept a few I kept this one and then
this is when I got in a wantable box and
then a few others in that matching pearl
bracelet and then one from twisted
silver and then over here I have my
three favorite kind of smaller braid nut
bracelets my three smaller necklaces
that aren't like huge statement
necklaces so I was able to still kind of
organize them this way so they're not
getting all mixed up with each other but
I like having them all here because
these I wear all the time my
statement necklaces I wear you know
really not that often but these and my
dainty ones I wear on an everyday basis
so I like having these all here together
and the last drawer is again divided
into two sections and this is actually
the ring holder so it's got a ton of
those rows that you stick your rings
between but instead I am using them for
stud organization I was really excited
about that because it just kind of hit
me one day and I was really I tried it
out and it worked and all my studs that
I wanted to keep fit in there so I was
so ecstatic that that worked well and
you know they don't move around and even
the big ones the little back part still
will fit in there so it works really
really well and this is again a gauge
for me all of this is to make sure that
I don't get too much jewelry that won't
even fit in here because I don't need
that many studs but I wear studs more
than I wear anything in my ears so I've
got quite a collection I've got some my
little Mickey studs in there some ones I
got from wantable
a lot of these are from shop lately my
little pink bow earrings that remind me
of Minnie I actually got on shop lately
as well I end up wearing my just boring
silver ball earrings all the time as
well as my like cubic zirconium little
studs I wear those all the time
and then I have the two watches that I
wear all the time just sitting over here
I used to have I was saying this in my
declutter video I used to have like 10
watches and they were all really
inexpensive but I had all these bright
colors and I just I think I've just kind
of outgrown them and for me I realize on
a day-to-day basis I really just needed
something with silver and something with
gold and that kind of covers any kind of
outfit I would wear so love love love
these - this one's Geneva which is a
really inexpensive one like ten dollars
you can buy on Amazon and they have all
kinds and this is the brand Berg EBU rgi
I don't know how to say it but it was a
more expensive brand but I really really
liked it and I got it on HauteLook for
really cheap moving to the right of
where that jewelry box was is where I
keep my dangly earrings now this I also
went through in that declutter video the
piece that's holding this was bought a
long time ago at Big Lots for really
cheap so they don't sell this exact one
but big lot still sells a bunch and you
can buy earring trees anywhere I think
Claire sells them you can buy them
online if you just type in earring tree
and they have much cuter ones in this
one this
kind of boring but I I kind of like that
because it's already enough color going
on that I don't want it to look any more
cluttered than it already might so I
like the black anyway but this is what I
ended up keeping out of all of my
collection I've got kind of my hoops
here and just kind of more muted dangly
things there my big old favorite
medallion earrings there these were from
Target premier designs shop lately
premier designs wanna Bowl premier
designs target shop lately I don't
remember where from and shop lately a
lot he's roughly it's almost
embarrassing when I see how much money
I've spent on that site but there
everything's usually like under five
dollars so it's a win right I mean
that's not bad
but these are all earrings that I wear
all the time and I love so those are the
ones that I kept and again this is a
great way for me to gauge I don't want
to have that much more than this and I
certainly don't want more than what I
can hold on this but you can see there's
a lot of room to grow I just kind of
space everything out a little more but I
certainly have room to grow there so
we're now in my closet which is where I
keep the few statement necklaces that I
kept sorry this is the Lighting's poor
but well we are in my closet I kept this
one which I think my boyfriend got well
I know he got it for me I just don't
know where from this was from shop
lately I wear all the time this was a
premiere designs longer one that I think
is really pretty I'll kind of pull it up
so you can see the bottom I like that
one
this is one I just recently got from
wantable that I really like and then
this is a twisted silver one that I
really like and I probably could have
fit it in my jewelry box but it would
have been kind of cramped in any of the
drawers that I would have put it in so I
figure it gets knotted up easily since
it's too kind of bizarre strands so I
wanted to keep it kind of separate so I
keep those in there just kind of on one
of these like purse hangers or hat
hangers and I've got other things in
here going on that I need to clearly
declutter my purses and things like that
but that's where I'm keeping those big
statement necklaces so that they're not
getting tangled up and and so that I can
see what I have there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
