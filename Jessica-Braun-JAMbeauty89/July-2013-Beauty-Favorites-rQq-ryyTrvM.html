have actually a lot to share with you
and it was really cool because this has
been like the first month where the all
of these products were so easy to come
by like I literally looked through like
my collection and I was like the it was
just so obvious what I'd been using so
much of you I'm saying so I really did
kind of hit a routine this month but
that just means that I found products
that I really loved so here we go
so one thing will start with nail polish
which actually this is the only thing I
have now related I got this at CVS and
it's the nail polish remover but it's
got a twist and lock pump so you open it
up and there's like three little holes
and you twist it so that it's like open
and then you take like a cotton pad and
you can press it oh I didn't unlock it
hold on there we go and then you press
it down and it gets nail polish remover
all over it
so you're not having to like tilt the
bottle or anything like that and then
you can just lock it back and shut it
and it's not it's not going anywhere you
know I'm saying so good and I feel like
it was around five dollars and you know
you can get extra box and there's all
kinds of deals always going on
especially for CVS brand things so I
really like this I know that ZOA has one
that's like this and I'm sure other
brands do too but I was really excited
to find this for under $5 so really
really cool and of course then you could
just refill the bottle if you really
like the pump which is I mean I do so
that's pretty awesome okay so um into
the realm of makeup my favourite room
okay so one thing that I have been using
almost every single day this month has
been the Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid
makeup I had always I'd it and I finally
bought it about a month ago or so and I
got it in the shade 20 which is called
natural ivory and it's a little bit
darker for me had it been like a normal
time of year but I did have some color
so this ended up being perfect it's just
so nice and I apply it with my Beauty
Blender and it just goes on really
nicely it has SPF of 20 in it and it
just has a really nice like dewy glowy
look when it's finally applied and I
just really like it I do have to set it
with the powder but it wears
nicely throughout the day and if you're
kind of in a rut and you're looking for
something new to try I would recommend
this because I really do like it now but
I think if you have really really oily
skin you might not like it as much or
you might want to set it with a really
really good powder but otherwise I think
you love it
another thing that I've really been
loving and I was surprised that I liked
it as much as I do is the Sonia Kashuk
liquid blush and it's in the shade poppy
and what I do to apply it is all just
like squeeze it it's a little pump I'll
pump a little bit on my hand and then
with a stipple brush I'll stipple it
into it and then stipple it on to the
cheeks it is a gorgeous wash of color
and I've really kind of grown into
liking that type of thing because I
usually use powder blushes as I'm sure
most of us do and I really love the way
this applied and then then that leads me
into a new favorite which is the benefit
Benetint and so I applied this and what
what I did with this one and actually
this is what I'm wearing today is it's
kind of like a nail polish thing I just
dotted it a few times on the apple of my
cheek and then I used a simple brush
like one from ELF and just stippled it
back into you know what I mean into the
bronzer that I'd already used and I
absolutely love this
both of these huh and they're so nice in
the summer time because they are just
fresh you know they don't look powdery
they don't look anything like that
they're just a very fresh wash of color
on your cheeks I was surprised that I
liked them as much as I do
so another thing I've been loving is
this mark brand thing and I posted a
picture of this like in one of my face
of the days on Instagram and someone was
like woah you own mark products and if
you don't know mark is owned by Avon
it's like it's kind of like avons
attempt at reaching a younger audience
if you will you know what I mean but I
really like their products and the
packaging is always really cute and by I
really like their products I mean I've
tried things in the past that I like and
I don't currently own any so I bought
this and I also bought another thing
that I haven't tried out yet but this is
a eye primer and eye primer and it's
called please hold then I got it in
light to medium and it literally is just
an eye primer and I kind of like that
the pack
you can just dip my finger in wipe it
all over really quickly I don't know I
actually really like it it holds my
eyeshadow really well and it kind of
mutes out that area color wise so it's
like a fresh palette for my shadow so I
really like it I got it on sale like it
was literally ended up being like four
dollars so I'm not sure its original
price but I really like it
another thing I've been loving is this
I'm pretty sure I've mentioned this
quite a few times this wet and wild
color icon bronzer in reserved your
Cabana I try to use other highlighters
and I do I mean there are certain ones I
absolutely love like my Mac soft and
gentle I love like I mean there's so
many I love but for everyday use I
always reach for this ones the wet and
wild one and reserve your mana because
it doesn't really have any shimmer to it
it's just a nice light color and it just
looks so nice on your cheekbones
of course I usually apply it with a
brush but um and it's like 399 so if you
haven't bought it yet just go buy it you
will absolutely love it I promise you
you really will okay another thing that
I have kind of rediscovered is my
L'Oreal color riche bomb and it's in the
shade rose elixir and I'm wearing it
today it has just a little bit of color
but not really much and they're just so
nice they're perfect for summer you
don't need a mirror and I love the way
that they smell and I feel like these
get overlooked and I just love it
I hope you guys love them too but I mean
I could swatch it but it really is a
light wash of color you're probably not
gonna see much on there they're just so
beautiful and I really like how it has a
light fragrance and a little bit of SPF
in it so okay a new favorite like
something that I just recently started
using and I absolutely love is the
Rimmel match perfection concealer /
highlighter I have it in the shade 125
fair and it's a little it's a brush
applicator and you just kind of squeeze
it and I'll usually just do my classic
like triangle and then out over the tops
of my cheekbones and then I'll just use
my Beauty Blender to blend it into the
skin it's just a beautiful highlighter I
usually don't use this alone I'll
usually use some sort of concealer like
in my under eye area but I should
probably try using this alone because I
might like it alone but I really really
like it over top of other concealers
over the top of I hate when people say
over top of things I don't know why that
bothers me and I've caught myself doing
it and I don't like it so I use it over
the top of other concealers I'm being
crazy just ignore me okay another thing
that I've been loving is the covergirl
clump crusher I just recently started
using it I've never tried it the brush
is very very thin and kind of detailed
if you will you know it's a very
detail-oriented brush really attends to
the details of your lashes so it really
does though you know it's just um I'm
wearing it today I use it in conjunction
with the rocket and I really like it it
definitely separates your lashes I adds
volume but not as much volume as I'd
like alone so that's why I paired it
with the rocket but I really really like
it so um one thing that I use every
single day and I don't know that I've
ever mentioned and I use it I've been
using it every single day for like a
year I pretty much always use on my
under eye lash line and it's the essence
long-lasting eye pencil and it's in the
shade bling bling and it's just a
retractable eyeliner and it's a gold
brought more of a bronze color and I
just always use it under my eye because
it's not as stark as something like a
black liner even in dark brown but it's
not as light as like you know a muted
nude color it's perfect and it adds a
little bit of shine under there but
nothing too crazy like it's not really
obvious unless you're up close but it
adds just enough definition under there
I really really like this and these are
like 2 or 3 dollars they're so cheap
ok so I've also fall in love with this
Real Techniques brush it's the duo fibre
I brush and these come in a set I don't
know if this one's sold separately but
it is the most perfect crease brush
because it picks up enough of the color
but not so much so it really adds a nice
wash to your crease without it being any
like a line you know
saying I love this brush it's one of
those that when you apply it you don't
need to apply it and then get a separate
brush to blend it you can just apply and
blend with this one brush it is amazing
and it comes clean really easily too
which is nice okay another one that's a
three dollar fine is the elf daily brush
cleanser the sprayer nozzle is really
really good it has a really nice scent
which I was pleasantly surprised and
I've been using it for quite a while and
I've only used half of it but it's
perfect for the brushes that you kind of
need to clean every day or at least wipe
off you know you just a few spritzes of
it and then wipe it off on your towel or
baby wipe whatever you've got in front
of you and it just kind of keeps them
clean usually for ones like these I'll
use this um like my stipple brushes any
dual fiber brushes like this I like I
like to clean every single time I use
them so I'll use this and then of course
I deep clean them with baby shampoo as
often as I can not as often as I should
but as often as I can but for day-to-day
this is perfect and it's a little less
harsh than the like I'll use like
alcohol you know what I mean but that's
really kind of harsh and I don't really
know if it's damaging my brushes or not
so I don't like to use it too often so
this is perfect for a daily brush
cleaning so those are all of my July
favorites I hope you maybe find
something new to add to your shopping
list I know most of these are pretty
inexpensive and they're just wonderful
wonderful products that I would stand
behind so I would love to hear what your
