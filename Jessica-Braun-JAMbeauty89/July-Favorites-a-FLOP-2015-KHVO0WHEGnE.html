my July favorites and I've got one blob
so let's go ahead and get into it so my
first favorite is a surprise to me this
is the Real Techniques Beauty sponge and
it's essentially like a Beauty Blender I
mean they're all sponges they're just
based on just but I've been using the
Beauty Blender for a long time and I
hauled this recently in my Ulta haul
video and this is so much cheaper than
the Beauty Blender and you guys I like
this better
it's got a wider surface area here and I
don't know there's something about the
shape of it that it's just it fits in
your hand a little bit better like this
flat part sits really well against your
hand and then you can just go to town oh
my gosh I love it and then you can use
the flat part on areas of your face I
mean I don't know what it is about this
I feel like it distributes my makeup
more evenly it holds the water in a
better way I just it is amazing and it's
cheaper so I will never buy another
Beauty Blender again I mean I've got a
couple that I'll keep until they're just
dead but I think I will just buy these
from here on out they're amazing my next
favorite is the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation there's been a lot of hoopla
about this and I've already filmed a
demo or review video it'll be up soon if
it's already up I will link it below
this is really really nice you guys and
there are some drugstore foundations
that I love just about as well as this
like the Revlon Colorstay whipped is
just as good as this but this really is
nice if you're like wanting to splurge
or maybe you have a gift card and you're
wanting to get a nice foundation this is
really really nice
it just it covers well and makes your
skin just look beautiful I mean it just
I can't really say what it is about this
but there's just something about this
that just makes you look really put
together let's go ahead and talk about
my dud this is the NYX baked blush plus
illuminator plus bronzer what
I didn't even honestly I hadn't even
read the title of this but that makes no
sense to me anyway it is in the shade
Spanish rose and when you see it it
looks gorgeous right and it's got a lot
of shimmer to it and it's absolutely
beautiful but when you swatch it there's
like nothing there I'm like well that's
no big deal because you're gonna put it
on the brush anyway and it's different
no this stuff looks so muddy on my face
but not only that it just doesn't stay
like I feel like I'll see it there and
like okay that's pretty but then an hour
later it's just gone just totally gone
so I have not tried any of the other
shades in this range then I know what
can formulas can really differ depending
on the shape you've got however I don't
even want to try the other ones this was
just really a dud for me I'm sad because
the fact you get some cute it's got the
little flower and everything but mmm
okay however a favorite of mine is
another NYX product this is the NYX HD
blush and soft spoken this is a really
beautiful peach shade and it just if
you've got fair skin like I do see this
is a lot more pigmented it just
complements my skin tones so well and oh
my gosh like I just love it and every
time I see a man who I want to put that
on because it's just so soft and I can't
really screw it up you know what I mean
it is lovely and these are so cheap
another favorite of mine is this book
called the life-changing magic of
tidying up there's a lot of buzz around
this book right now I read it I'm about
halfway through it I just uploaded my
clothing declutter following this method
it's so easy it's like two questions you
kind of ask yourself and if you haven't
seen the video I highly suggest watching
it it was one that I really enjoyed
making because it was really kind of a
life-changing experience for me at
surface level it is a really simple
method you can get really deep into it
but it's simple and it really has
transformed the way that I look at how
I'm organizing my space in my closet my
make of it everything but not only that
but really look at what I have and it's
way deeper than any
the other declutter that I've ever done
so definitely check it out all linked up
below this book is amazing and
life-changing you should get it it's
like five dollars used on Amazon that's
what I did now my last two favorites are
mascaras this one is the NYX skinny
mascara this stuff is amazing I also
have already filmed a demo using this
versus a really expensive version this
is amazing it's a really tiny brush to
like really separate your lashes it's
great for the lower lash line but not
only that but I usually use it as kind
of a primer where I'll put it on and
then put a mascara on top of it it's
just amazing again five or six bucks and
then the other mascara this is like a
rediscovered this is the Jordana best
slash extreme it's a really volumizing
mascara it's got a really thick kind of
classic brush but it really does hold my
curl while I'm wearing it today I just
love this this is one though that when
you first buy it you gotta let it kind
of air out for like a couple weeks
before it's at its peak but it is
amazing this is like three ninety-nine
at Walgreens I love this mascara so much
so hopefully you enjoyed my favourites
