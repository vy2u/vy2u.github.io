my July favorites so I actually have
nothing that I didn't like set the
proper set example are nothing that I
didn't like I have everything that I
like wait oh ok so the first thing I'm
gonna start with my favorite brush of
the month and i think i'm gonna try and
do a favorite brush each month to just
cuz i like a lot of different brands and
a lot of you guys asked a lot like what
brunch is over come in and of course
i've recommended certain brands like I
love diva beauty brushes sigma brushes
are good they're a little more pricey
things like that but there are very
specific brushes that I like from random
other brands too so my favorite brush to
the month is the Real Techniques powder
brush which is pretty inexpensive you
can find them at Ulta and where else I
don't know I mean sometimes you can find
them at other drug stores can't you like
I feel like maybe walgreens cells maybe
not I do idea regardless i got mine at
Ulta and I just love it it's the perfect
it's literally like the only powder
brush that I love I don't have any other
powder brushes that I'm completely in
love with the way that I'm in love with
this because it's really soft and really
really big and it can just cover a lot
of ground really quickly and it's
perfect to just like swipe you know you
can dip it in your powder once and just
swipe it all over and it's perfect
you're good to go and I just I just love
it and every time I use it I never feel
like I look really powdery because it
really kind of evenly disperses the
powder so definitely recommend this one
another favorite is my favorite
foundation I can't stop using it for a
while I wasn't wearing any Foundation at
all but the past like week or two have
been getting back into the swing of
school and work and things like that so
I've been wearing foundation a little
more and this is so good it's the Revlon
age-defying firming and lifting makeup
and it has an SPF of 15 and as a pump
which I love it just makes it easier to
apply and you can control you really
can't control this pump but how much
comes out which I really appreciate of
course it's the drugstore drugstore
foundations to the price point is lower
than most but still so kind of pricey
although I think with the coupon and
their sale i ended up getting this for
like eight or nine dollars it wasn't too
bad um but i have in the shade bear buff
which is a little bit darker than I
would usually wear but in the summertime
of course I'm still pretty fair skin but
in the summer
I'm a little bit darker so it seems to
match really well with the rest of my
skin and it just wears really nicely i'm
wearing it today and it just seems to be
a medium coverage i would say and it's
certainly a little bit buildable but it
looks like that it looks a little bit
more radiant than like my revlon
colorstay and i love that one but this
one has a little bit more of a satin
finish where it just looks really nice
it's one of the first drugstore
foundations I found in a long time that
I genuinely every time I where I'm like
okay like I like the way my skin looks
it it cancels out any weirdness going on
but it's not so high coverage that it's
like a mask it's just that perfect
balance so i really really love this
stuff and I've been applying it with any
sort of buffing brush and it also looks
really beautiful with the Beauty Blender
that's the most beautiful way to do it I
think but sometimes I don't have the
time like that takes a little bit longer
so even with the buffing brush it's
really good okay hold on I need to like
slow down because my throat's starting
to hurt and like close up and there's
like things flying around my nose
ditchin ah like a mess okay a
rediscovered favorite of mine is the
Loreal voluminous mascara and this I
used to adore for the longest time it
was like the only thing I use and then I
started my youtube channel and I started
really branching out with what I was
trying and I found things that I like
things that I didn't like things that
were okay and I so I didn't use this in
like a year and a half and i just
recently opened a new one and upon first
opening it it's amazing it actually
holds the curl like even my boyfriend is
coming since like your lashes look
really nice you're wearing fake ones
like no never know I do sometimes but no
i really don't i have a few and I've
like never worn them I used to wear them
all the time and shows and so I'm just I
just don't in real life I just don't not
even for videos because it's too it's
too much it's just too much and for me
that's just not my style anyway I'm like
I'm not gonna be fake like you guys know
how I feel about fakeness bake-off city
anyway um so yes this is amazing it
holds the curl really well the wand is
is pretty big but i like it i don't have
the water providers where the regular
and glasses black but the waterproof is
really good too I mean they have a
million versions of this but I just like
the original I don't even use the carbon
block really I just like the
rich anywho okay I used to lip favorite
time I've really been getting into
lipstick a little bit more and I've been
looking for some nice nudes just for you
know everyday work I don't want to wear
fuchsia on my lips you know so this had
just recently got from hautelook for
freaking eight dollars it's the
two-faced la creme lip sticks these
suckers are like twenty eight dollars or
18 now regardless it's over like twelve
dollars which is way too much for
lipstick and it was only eight dollars
on hautelook so I bought every shade I
was like there were four shades on there
and so I literally bought all four for
almost the price of one it was amazing
and the thing about these are the
packaging is so like luxurious and like
heavy and like it it just snaps together
like slides in beautiful I if you have
one of these you know what I mean if you
don't it probably makes no sense but
this is the shade in the buff and I'm
wearing it today and I'm not usually
into these kind of brownie nudes but
this is the first one I've ever tried
where I think it looks flattering with
my skin tone finally it doesn't look odd
i feel like the brown nudes look really
good with people with darker skin tones
but for someone as light as I am it
doesn't always look as great but this
one is the first one that I'm like yes I
love it it really does add a little bit
of color so it looks more alive but not
like weird and so not only are these
super expensive you can get them for
cheaper on hautelook when it's on there
and i'll put the link below if you're
interested but i also bought some of
their lip glosses too and those are
really nice not a favorite yet because I
haven't really tried it out but this one
I can't stop wearing already so I i
already know i'm gonna just keep wearing
it all the time and then the lip gloss
I've been pairing with it is the
bellapierre cosmetics lip gloss and it's
in the shade vanilla pink that's a
perfect name for and I'm wearing it over
this right now I all sit over top and
then I would have died because i hate
when people say over tub it makes no
sense either it's over the top but over
top I don't know why that's one of those
things that bothers me I don't know why
it just sounds wrong even though I mean
it makes sense and I get it but I don't
like it I hate when people say over top
and i almost said it which means i've
been watching way too many videos lately
anyway so i've been wearing this over
the top of this
lipstick and it's just a really pretty
color and again it's a brownie kind of
color and it smells really nice it
smells like sponge cake or something
like that it smells really really nice
and a little bit different not too
vanilla just nice but i really like
these together and i'm so excited to
finally have like a workable lip do oh
that's perfect for work that's cool ok
so the next thing I've fallen in love
with is the elf I brightener it's like
whoa it's like three or four dollars i'm
not sure exactly how much and i got it
the shade buff it is a really good dupe
for the bare minerals well rested
concealer or really for any of them and
they sell a few shades of this as well
just as they do with the bare minerals
but it's just as good you can wear it
alone and it cancels out or you can wear
it to kind of set your concealer I wore
today to set my concealer and the
concealer i'm wearing is the mac pro
longwear and then this just really sets
it and cancels out even more darkness or
anything like that and it's just you
know a loose powder I just use a fluffy
eyeshadow brush to apply I mean a clean
one obviously and I just tap it off and
just swirl it in that area and it just
really sets nicely it helps to prevent
creasing and any of that stuff so and I
think oh no it doesn't have an SPF which
is probably good just because sometimes
in pictures if you have SPF and your
concealer or powder under there it ends
up being like stark white you look like
a raccoon so all right and my last
favorite is this Sigma I haven't had a
sigma favorite in a million years and
this was one that they sent to me a long
time ago when I first became an
affiliate and I liked it but I wasn't so
sure but i just recently reopened it and
I thought oh for sure this is gonna be
dried out it's a cream shadow and it's
in the shade persuade or it's an
eyeshadow base they call it and I
thought oh my gosh for sure this is
going to be dried out not it's been like
I don't know how long quite a while and
it's not dried out and what I like about
it is that it's a nude color and it's
meant to cancel out you know any veining
anything like that and it's a really
good primer well I've been using the
past two weeks because I wonder if I
cuz I couldn't really remember how I
felt about it this stuff might be the
best primer I own now I own like the mac
paint pot and I really like that but
this hold on to your shadow better and
since it's just a matte color it really
cancels out I mean it's like a freaking
clean slate it's it is the best one that
I own right now I don't know if they're
better ones out there it's the best 1i
own right now so I can put the link for
this below if you're interested in I
don't think they're too expensive
Sigma's makeup I haven't really tried
much of this is one of the very few
things i have tried of their makeup and
i really do like it and I can't believe
as in dried out all my color tattoos
dried out and so and I know there's a
wait and kind of revive them but i ended
up either getting rid of them or
whatever um just cuz i don't i have no
color tattoos right now so i might pick
up a few more because i did like them
but they tried up so freaking fast this
one impressed me so really like this and
really impressed with the staying powder
power of it really that was kind of
quick okay well no it was about ten
minutes that's quick for me though you
know you know I see some people they can
knock out their favorites in like four
minutes I'm like dang I'm like no
freakin way will I ever get it down to
four minutes and I have no desire to
most of you guys like I don't mind the
long videos and you know summer 30,000
in song and summer 10 minutes long
without a shore psycho anyway I hope
that was helpful for you guys let me
know what your favorites were for the
month of july and i'll catch you guys do
