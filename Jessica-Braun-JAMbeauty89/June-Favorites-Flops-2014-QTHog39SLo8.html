favorites for you and I also have a few
things that were not so favorite so
first thing this is the most standout
item ever amber amber is the Paula's
Choice resist super light daily wrinkle
defense and basically what this is is
just a tinted sunscreen and I it's being
honest with you and with myself I was
terrible about using SPF because I just
wouldn't use it honestly and so maybe I
would be using a foundation that
happened to have some SPF in it but like
on the base that there wasn't any of my
foundation I wasn't applying any extra
and I know that's really bad especially
as I'm starting to get older you know
we're all getting older every day but I
was like I really should take care of my
skin I really should use SPF whether I'm
being outside or not but I mean everyday
I'm outside at some point anyway so I
was excited to find out about this and
the fact that it was tinted so it was
kind of it kind of worked as a primer
but on top of that it provided a little
bit of coverage on top of that it was
not greasy that was my biggest thing
it's always Tracy so this is amazing
ladies like I remember buying in the
past I remember buying the origins vitae
Seng when that was a big deal and
everyone was talking about saying oh
it's amazing you know it has like the
sheer tint release thing which I was
like I don't even know what that means
but I remember buying it and being so
disappointed because it didn't do
anything for my skin it was just like
but this like I literally here's what
I've been doing and this is unheard of
because I wear foundation everyday I'm
one of those people that I just always
wear foundation or maybe a BB cream
maybe I have been using just this and
then I think I would use some sort of
like powder foundation over it no
foundation or anything else and that's
what I did today I love the way my skin
has been looking now I've been doing a
lot of different things with my skincare
which I'll be making a video on soon
once I feel confident in the way of
and I really am loving every product but
this has been my favorite thing in the
universe because I just use it first
thing it seeps right into the skin it's
got SPF what is the SPF in this 30 it's
perfect it's got antioxidants oh it's
making your skin better oh my gosh oh
just like hit my lash anyway I know I
just talked for like 2 minutes about
this but I love it I've never ever found
a product that's quite like this now it
is a little pricier it's not like
insanely pricey but it still is pricey
so if you know of any products that are
similar to this that you love that
aren't greasy that I have an SPF that
have a little bit of a tint to it
that work as like an under foundation
primer let me know
it's one of those kind of nice you know
just get stopped next thing is this tart
blushing bride cream blush now
well they okay they Marcus the cheeks in
and wearing it today I apply this with
my ELF three dollar stipple brush and
what I do is I'll just you know on the
top just stipple it in and then simple
it onto my cheeks and then kind of blend
it with it and sometimes I'll take like
a thicker foundation brush and kind of
blend it a little more so it's not like
a harsh you know that's what I do with
any blush this is the only cream style
blush that I've ever seen that actually
stays on all day I really really like
this corset is pricier I got it for free
and my arch no boxycharm right it was it
I never remember which box think some it
had to have been boxycharm there's no
way I don't even get Birchbox what are
we talking about my brain is off today I
can't even get anything out right this
video is gonna be insane anyway I really
like this that actually stays on all day
it kind of has a funky smell not like a
bad but it is kind of interesting but I
love it and I'm just so excited that
this came in that freaking boxy shirt
and baller alright what's next
okay here's kind of a for the month this
was the Ofra Universal eyebrow pencil
and you saw it in one of my recent
videos that I got I got it in one of my
bosses and it's not that it's a bad idea
pencil it's actually fine but I noticed
that it's a little bit patchy it's not
as smooth as like the Nastasia brow is
that you guys know I love that's worth
every penny I'm telling you but anyway
it's a little bit patchy but you know
you can kind of comb through and you can
make it work it's not as bad as some
pencils I'm used but it's not universal
I don't care what they say it pulls just
a little bit red on me I don't know
about other people and I've tried it
with a light hand I turn it darker you
know I've tried it the different ways
cuz obviously that's how you get the
different shades is the amount of
pressure you're using but I just I
wasn't impressed with it so I mean I
wouldn't recommend it I got it for free
and you know if there were a rainy day
and I were out
my brow is I probably would use this but
it just wasn't my favorite and even my
boyfriend kind of was like messing with
my eyebrow see he didn't say anything
but I was using this and he came up and
he was like kind of messed with my
eyebrows and I'm like how bad did they
look that he actually like paid
attention right eyebrows I just felt
that was interesting I was like hmm
maybe not anyway you guys I can't stop
the cheese's are sitting right in here
and I keep looking at him like I want
more but I know if I eat it that I'm
gonna like get it out of my teeth before
I film more and got Scott okay stop
all right in the realm of brows this is
this is kind of another flip-flop this
is the essence lash and brow gel mascara
and you can see I've been using it it's
got a little bit of the brown tint on it
now from brushing through my brows with
it this was sent to me from a subscriber
and what I will say it's a really
inexpensive brow gel and in the realm of
inexpensive brow gels this has been my
favorite
I've used it is a very wet formula so
you know you have to be aware that what
I'll usually do is once I brush through
it and kind of get it how I want I'll
kind of go like this and get the excess
off it'll eventually dry anyway but I
just do that because I just do but it's
not as like the anasazi a brow gel is
like it's almost like hairspray for your
brows which you could actually use
hairspray to on your brows for your big
anyway but that's almost like hairspray
which I really like because I've got
like hairs over here that kind of will
get wonka dog and I don't want them to
be walking dog halfway through the day
so I love that I massage here for that
because if they don't budge they don't
move but if you don't like that kind of
crispy feel then this would be perfect
for you because and especially if you
don't have unruly brows it's nice it
dries you know so it doesn't look weird
or glossy I mean it really is a nice
product so it's kind of wishy-washy for
me just because I do like crispy brows
but it is a nice product and it's
inexpensive so that's kind of a win-lose
you know it just depends on your
personal preference I
I should say this eyeliner is amazing
this this might use my favorite
starlooks product I've ever owned and I
never would have guessed it because I'm
not big on colored liner I kind of got
more into it lately and I've been using
it on my lower lash line and I think I
mentioned this recently - but it's the
star looks liner and exit to Eden and
it's just this beautiful kind of sparkly
but not actual sparkles but it's just
this like light green kind of garden
green color that's what I picture in my
head
and of course exit to Eden I'm thinking
of the Garden of Eden but it's beautiful
it stays on all day it looks really cool
meshed with your mascara so it still
kind of looks dark down there but it's
got like extra dimension but it doesn't
look like Pal green but it's just
something different than just brown or
black you know without being too
in-your-face so I feel like I could wear
this to teach in and I wouldn't feel
like I'm wearing some some insane colors
you know which I would do still anyway
don't really care but um you know I like
color there's nothing wrong with that
but I just think it's really a nice fun
pop without being too in-your-face that
makes sense I think this is a safe for
work color and liner that's what I'm
trying to say okay so the next item is
one that I completely just forgot about
I've had it for a while it's the NYX
mega shine lip gloss and sugarpie and
it's just this really beautiful light
light peach like basically a nude
colored lip gloss and I don't really own
very many I own a lot of peach ones but
they're usually a little bit brighter or
just a little bit more color to them but
this one really is quite a nude and I
just forgot how amazing it is just
straight up on its own it's really good
at toning down brighter lip sticks but
it's also just beautiful on its own and
it's not it still has enough color to it
that it doesn't look like completely
washed out and I'm pretty pale so if it
doesn't wash me out I probably won't
wash anyone else oh but I just love it
and this poor little Bobbie I forgot
about and really I never reached for it
because the problem with these NYX mega
shine lip glosses is that the area here
gets like really not dirty book it just
covered in gloss so after using it like
I feel like
times it's just it once you close it it
like squeezes out gloss all around the
lip of the lid it grosses me out and so
every once in a while I'll just wipe it
all down I'll wipe out inside there with
a q-tip and just clean it all out as
well as I can and then it's good for a
while but I wish it doesn't the two of
these that I own they both do it I
haven't had that experience with other
lip glosses so I don't know what the
deal is but I love the formula and the
smell is pretty strong so if you're
weird about cents you better like it but
I love this shade okay a few more the
laura geller this is a duo it's the
balance in bronze foundation and bronzer
in fair and I got this on HauteLook I've
never bought these things full price duh
um but I got it on HauteLook fur I want
to say this was maybe like $12 or $15 I
mean really cheap almost comparables
like if you were to buy physician's
formula which is drugstore but it's
freaking expensive drugstore anyway but
um I love this because the bronzer is
really really nice it's still kind of a
dark bronzer for me but it's really nice
to kind of just lightly bronze your face
up or even just use as a blush kind of
replacement you know and then the
balance in Brighton I actually got a
full-size just of the balance of
Brighton as well and it is amazing it
looks amazing over that tinted sunscreen
I talked about the beginning of the
video
it's just flawless and you don't need
any foundation it's amazing it's a
really beautiful powder foundation they
have you know obviously different colors
they don't have a ton but I think they
have enough you can kind of make it work
for your skintone but I just love them I
love the formula of these laura geller
baked products they're just absolutely
amazing and I remember getting totally
sucked in she was on QVC or something a
couple months ago and I was just like
drooling watching it because this woman
Laura Geller I mean the process that
they go through to make this makeup
really is really cool so it makes me
happy to buy her products because
they're advice anyway okay this was a
surprise favorite for me I got it
recently and I showed it in that Mary
Kay haul that my friend Katie sent me
and it's their cream shadow and it's in
the shade metallic tote but it is truly
a metallic taupe perfect name for it
and the thing that surprised me that I
liked is a the color it's neutral but I
don't usually wear this but I okay look
for me with cream shadow I always wear
it just on my lid maybe I'll put it all
over if it's like a lighter color or
maybe I'll work it into the crease but I
don't usually use just cream shadow like
just an increase and for me this would
be more of a crease color just cuz you
guys know me I'm usually pretty neutral
well I was like you know what I wonder
so I put it all over my lid and I was
like okay I don't like it alone that
color on my skintone so then I took my
next favorite which is the Maybelline
Color tattoo pigment in barely brazen
which is just this beautiful champagne
color and I put the metallic taupe all
over my lid and I did a couple coats
because it is kind of a thinner
consistency for a cream shadow which I
don't mind cuz it dries in its face put
all day but it is thinner than most
certainly thinner than like the
Maybelline Color tattoo ones anyway so
then I put this pigment on top of it and
it just was this beautiful like
multi-dimensional iridescent champagne
color so the tote the metallic taupe
underneath it kind of just made it look
dimensional and just interesting I would
love to know what your guys's favorites
and especially your Wow's where this
month let me know down below if you made
this video as well send me the link I
love watching them I love learning about
new products and it's a little easier to
watch your guys's videos than just doing
a ton of research online so I'd rather
do that anyway also if you have any
ideas for videos that you would like me
to do also let me know down below and
I'll catch you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
