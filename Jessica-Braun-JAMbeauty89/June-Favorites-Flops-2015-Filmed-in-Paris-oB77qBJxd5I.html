in happy and I'm so bad at saying I like
French arse it's ridiculous try them
excited me all the time cuz you can
actually speak it pretty well and I
don't know as much as I wish that I did
anyway so I am here to bring you my June
favorites and it's a little bit early
but I don't care I was just excited to
share some of the things that I've been
loving this month I'm on my honeymoon
right now if you didn't know we just got
married last weekend back home where we
live in Indiana and of course we're on
our honeymoon and this is like the first
our honeymoons three weeks which is such
a blessing and the first leg of our
honeymoon is here in Paris and so Tyler
and I are filming a bunch of vlogs and
on his channel since this is more travel
and vlog oriented we're putting all of
them on there so if you want to see kind
of what we're up to and what our
experience has been like so far in a
foreign country which has been quite
interesting quite a learning experience
I'll link his channel below if you
wanted to check it out but go ahead and
get into my favorites so my first
favorite is an app and that the app is
called snupps and I first heard of it Oh
while ago a friend of mine who's got
like a really big the she's really into
fashion she had mentioned it that she
puts all of her stuff on there like the
clothes she has and I was like what is
it cuz it didn't really make sense and
she said you just like upload everything
in your collection whether it be like
all your purses are all your shoes or in
my case all of your makeup and you can
organize them into shelves so like I've
got all of my makeup here wha not all of
it I've got I've started my pallet
collection so like I've got naked one in
naked 2 so I took a picture of my Naked
palette and I
added it to my eyeshadow palettes shelf
on this app so basically the idea is
that you can put everything you own in
here so you can share it with people
it's kind of like social media in that
way so I can share with my friends or
with you guys on the app everything I
own so you can kind of see and get an
idea and I even saw I was looking
because I follow a few people on here
and this one girl even cooks like she
had a new shelf called empty repurchases
so it was cool for me to look and it's
kind of like an empties video but she
just doesn't on here where she shows
these are products that I am done with
that I'm rebind because they were so
good so I've been trying to click
through and see what she's really liking
and getting idea up okay those were good
enough that she wanted rebuy them so it
makes me want to go out and buy them so
I thought that was a really cool idea
snaps actually reached out to me to see
if I wanted to use the app and I'm laugh
because I was like I already use the app
sure we give it I love it so I'm excited
to get back home to well I'm not not
much of a rush to go back home but I'm
excited to get back home and kind of put
more of my collection here because like
I said I'd only done my eyeshadow
palettes to kind of get a feel for it
back a while ago
anyway that's really cool so follow me
on there and I will probably follow you
back because I'm only following a few
people so I'm trying to get more Beauty
people on here anyway so yeah I will
link that below and my username on here
is GM beauty 89 so I'm pretty easy to
find on there and I'm gonna try and
update that when I get back okay so into
my beauty phase one of mine is a Garnier
Fructis product this is the texture
tease strike touch finishing spray I
have used this before I don't know if I
ever mention it in the favorites video
but it is really really really good
basically the way I used I even used it
on my wedding day is I spray it all
throughout my hair and kind of let it
set into my hair
you Sande to hair but really it works
that they want my hair really is pretty
fine and it's really hard to do up dudes
with their messy buns with because it
just like sits kind of like limp but
this helps it like actually have grit to
it so it'll like if I put it in a cute
messy bun and I wanted to stay kind of
high up and like kind of sticking up if
you know what I mean it'll actually hold
it it really is amazing so highly
recommend this stuff it's like $3.00 at
the drugstore so definitely definitely
check that out if you're wondering what
I'm wearing on my lips which I've been
wearing if you've seen any my Paris
pictures I've uploaded on my social
media the I'm wearing it's a matte
lipstick it's a retro matte and all
fired up I don't know if they still sell
this and it's the old matte formula so
it's really really really dry but it's a
really pretty like cool toned red I love
it but I wish it wasn't so drying
because it's one of those lipsticks it's
really hard to wear like all day like I
was out and about with Tyler here in
Paris and if I wanted to be a client
constantly cuz it was very dry and I was
cracking so that stinks but the good
news is another favorite of mine this is
the only I think expensive everything
else is really really cheap this is the
Mac matte lipstick and please me and a
subscriber mention this to me as an idea
for a wedding lipstick and they redid
their math formula I'm sure I don't
think it was that recent but and this is
this beautiful like kind of dusty pink
but it's got enough color to it that it
shows up it doesn't make your lips look
washed out I didn't wear it on my
wedding day but it is absolutely
beautiful and it's actually it reminds
me of like the Maybelline matte
lipsticks it's really moisturizing kind
and I just love the color speaking of
lipsticks one that I have fallen in love
with I've been looking for a really good
peach lipstick this is the wet and wild
lipstick in 903 C it's not even on there
and it's a really kind of bright peach
color but what I love about it is again
it's really mattifying and I wonder if
one while we did their formula because
they this used to be really I had a
different
it was really drying kind of like that
the red Mac when I told you about but I
feels a little bit more moisturizing
than it used to be so I don't know
anyway it's just this really almost
bright but not quite peach color and I
love wearing it with this Rimmel stay
classy stay classy
no stay gloss beat Wow it's a Rimmel
lipstick no look laws what
it's a Rimmel lip gloss and stay glossy
and it's in the shade non-stop glamour
and it's like this really pretty light
peach kind of shimmery color and I can't
stop wearing this this looks beautiful
on its own I think in my may favorites
video I mentioned another one of these
in a different color I'm just loving
this formula so much and these two are
so pretty together I was inspired by
kaki from the channel blam life guru
she loves Dino 3c and she worked with I
guess a different Rimmel glossy lip
gloss and then I remembered that I had
this one and I was like wait a minute so
these are beautiful together this lip
gloss really kind of tones down that
peach and it just looks like that it's
like that white peach that you always
want your lips to look like when you're
going for it this gives you it so and
they're both under $5 they're so cheap
when in Paris we went to a grocery store
and you can see it nerve blog and they
have it's funny because French wine in
the States can be so expensive even if
it's you know I mean I don't know I
don't know what you would consider cheap
wine on it they all just seem to be so
expensive but here since you know we're
in France that's like a local wine so
it's not nearly as expensive so we're
getting some really great wines that
would be way expensive in America for
like five dollars and under here in
France Mike and we should have just
brought a suitcase and filled it but
loving it and yes I'm about 21 I'm 26
thank you okay so another one I got my
nails done for the wedding of course I
did and they're looking a little raggedy
now so if you see them in close-ups
sorry but I see I pick up my cuticles
and she
of course notice and she I asked her I
said you know what do you recommend
what's a good to boil and she
recommended the solar oil from C&amp;amp;D and
I'd heard a little bit about this
recently and smells really nice this is
about eight dollars I found it at the
drugstore and it has this really nice
almost almond or nutty smell maybe like
cherry like amaretto I don't know anyway
it's so really it's not a thick oil so
really thin oil but you just put it on
your cuticles I kind of rub it in and it
just feels good it seems to be healing
my cuticles like I've got one area
that's just really dry and kind of
cracked so I'm hoping this will work on
it I've only been using it a couple days
but I really like it enough that I
actually brought it with me to Paris so
that says I think it M about it then
just a few days I used it I was so
impressed so definitely recommend if
you've got problem cuticles or they're
really dry and really I mean sometimes
mine are fine like in the summer time
but in the winter especially lotions
don't really cut it even if there are
really moisturizing hand cream I still
feel like it's not quite getting my
cuticles the way they need to be gotten
you know what I mean okay two more
drugstore favorites and then that's us
all this is the l'oreal lacquer liner i
used to buy this stuff like only this
stuff you guys and i i was trying some
other thing so I tried to maybelline one
and that's really good too and then I
have the essence one and it's really
good it's in the shade Midnight in Paris
I love that it's black but then I went
back to buying this one and I wore this
on my wedding day you guys this stuff is
amazing it is so so black it is it
doesn't move and it's not even
necessarily I don't think it's like
waterproof per se but it just doesn't
move even when it's in the corner of
your eyes there it just stays put this
stay put on me for the most part
throughout our whole like eight-hour
flight in the two hour
before that and the whole day of like
breakfast the day after the wedding I
mean just really for like 36 hours
is really what ended up happening and it
stayed put through sleeping on the plane
and be on a train I mean through
everything this stayed in place it
really is amazing and again under $10 I
think this is usually like seven or
eight dollars that's amazing and I have
it in blackest black my last favorite is
one I keep talking about but I can't
stop so when I was packing my makeup for
this vacation I literally laid like my
highlighters out and I was like okay
what highlighter you wanna bring I don't
want to bring a bunch of yeah like I
drop one one blush I bought more than
one lipstick but I only brought one
highlighter and I have like my hourglass
palette out and I had my my mac
mineralize skinfinish stuff in all these
really expensive highlighters out and I
still ended up going with this one
it is my favorite probably of all time
this is the hard candy one you buy it at
Walmart and it's in the shade Tiki and
it's just this golden beige highlighter
and it just it's not going to show up
here I'll show you a close-up it's just
so perfect for my skin tone and even
though I'm decently fair I'm not as fair
as I am but I'm pretty fair in my
opinion it just is beautiful it always
looks like the right amount of Sheen and
it looks good in the daytime even if
you're in the sunlight it looks good at
night it looks good and candlelight it
looks good always I love it so much and
it's one of those that it's such a good
ingenta for me in the drugstore and I
don't people like it but it's not loved
enough this should be like everyone's
Holy Grail ever and loved it and I
thought every time I've seen baked
products I always feel like they're
chalky or powdery or like rough to the
touch and I don't like it and in fact
there are baked products I have that are
like
and that's why I felt that way but this
one's almost like buttery like it just
feels so high-end
so like amazing so definitely try this
out if you've never tried these try it
out and we'll sing it I think it took
getting through like the top layer to
get that buttery feel but it'd almost be
worth just rubbing through and then you
get to it because you know it's
inexpensive enough that it's not great
to make that you waste that top layer
and it really is once you get below that
then it is just amazing I'm trying to
think if I hadn't even done this month
like things that I was like oh I didn't
bring it with me but the benefit blush
in its that newish one rocket or
I hate it I guess I shouldn't say hey I
love the way it smells it's a pretty
color in the pan and I love the
packaging but every time I've worn it I
bought it on my way to San Diego a few
months ago every time I've worn it
because of my skin tone it makes me look
just patchy and weird I don't know what
I'm I can't be applying it that wrong I
mean I've applied the other benefit
blushes but the shimmer in it I think
just really does not mesh right with my
skin tone I think it would look
beautiful on deeper skin tones but I
think if you've got a light or pale or
fair skin tone I don't know I just don't
like the way it looks on me I'm gonna
try it a few more times but I have to
say every time I've ever tried it I have
not loved it I really want to try the
benefit pavana
blush because it looks like you'd be a
nice light semi matte pink pinkish
purple almost and so I do that kind of
on my wish list for eventually getting
because it looks really really pretty
anyway so don't you let me know what
your favorites and flops have been this
month and stay tuned I'm
I'm hoping to film a video maybe on the
makeup that I brought with me on my
honeymoon
eventually I'll do the makeup I wore on
my wedding day video but a lot of that
is back home because I didn't bring all
of that so stay tuned for that in a few
weeks but in the meantime definitely
