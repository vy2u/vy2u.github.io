first impression demo and miniature
review of a new product that has either
already hit the shelves at Sephora or is
about to Kaplan MD is the brand name and
they contacted me and sent this to me to
review and I was just so intrigued so
we're gonna try this out and see you and
it's all about it says that it's the
perfect pout lip mask and lip balm duo
to hydrate plump and protect and it says
it's gluten sulfate paraben and
petrolatum free so that is good on the
back it says exclusive anti-aging lip
treatment duo that naturally redefines
the lip contour while reducing fine
lines infusing hydration and protecting
with SPF in just two simple steps so
we're gonna follow step 1 and step 2
we're gonna see what happens I'm about
to zoom you into my lips so we can get a
real feel for this so I am so intrigued
I can't even wait to see what this thing
does if it even works so I'm opening the
box up and there's like a packet of
instructions for the perfect pout and so
the first thing I'm seeing it's a little
like it's a little spatula
I can't wait this seems so weird and
gimmicky I don't know that I mean it
just seems like really do you really
think it works but maybe you won't maybe
I'll be surprised okay so I need the
instructions for real because here's
what I'm seeing there's like a little
jar and a little thing so this is the
lip 20 mask that they speak up and this
is the lip 20 balm that they're speaking
of so let's see if these things work so
the directions spread a generous amount
directly to clean lips on my lips are
clean enough
no they're clean and one-half inch
beyond the lip line ah hey keya wait so
I'm gonna be applying it to my lips
which are I mean pretty big I mean you
know they're not huge but they're not
small but I'm gonna go it says half an
inch around so this is gonna be
hilarious to watch it says expect a mild
tingling effect this is caused by the
papaya enzymes after three to five
minutes remove any excess products of
three to five minutes I've better
get a timer going remove any excess
product with a soft damp cloth
immediately follow with the lip 20 balm
which nourishes the skin seals and
hydration protects with SPF 20 sunburn
garden protection so it sounds like I'm
assuming this spatulas for this so I'm
just gonna apply it time it for three
minutes come back wipe it off and
immediately put on the bomb and we're
gonna see what happens so they said this
is gonna tingle
so it's seal which is a good thing okay
it smells like mint and it's a you know
you can see it's certainly a creamy
product so I'm just I'm still I feel
like I'm like baking alright here we go
I think I got too much I think I got it
in my uh
Oh guys this spatula all right I'm gonna
go beyond my lip contour I don't feel
anything ie it feels cool like blistex
well guys I can't do this I'm not very
good at it
it looks like Elmer Oh guys I'm really
sure like I hope you are cracking up cuz
I can't laugh enough to laugh for me
this is ridiculous I can't believe I'm
doing this on camera
okay it's just cool a lot farther than
the lip con I have an inch it's a lot
okay so three minutes somebody time me
I'm just kidding I'll fast-forward
through this I applied for somebody take
a screenshot of this and tweet it or
Instagram it at me because this is the
funniest thing ever I've ever done I'm
like tearing up I just want to laugh
okay so I gotta take I have about one
more minute and I've got to take a
selfie of this for Tyler in center to
him cuz he's gonna lose his mind he's
he's going to die
thank you I can't even do with this
Drake face I can't do it
he is going to lose his mind I'm just
gonna right guess what I'm working on
okay so it's been about four minutes and
it said what like three to five so I'm
just gonna wipe it off with a baby baby
wipe it tingled a little bit okay so it
tingle well I mean they look bigger so
I'm going to apply this bomb
you know what they might be a little
plumper to be honest with you I'm
serious what do you guys think they're
still like tingly they they might be
plumper I'm assuming I'm kind of amazed
now I know I mean there are a lot of lip
plumping products out there that work
and so I'm not that surprised that it
actually might work but at the same time
you know some things are so gimmicky
it's like really I mean not bad let me
wipe my little spatula off that is cute
made me feel like a baker but boy I felt
ridiculous doing it on camera if I were
alone no I'd probably still be cracking
up alone Who am I kidding I would have
been laughing but I like I mean it I
like that there's like little holders
for it it's cute um I'm gonna wait a few
minutes cuz it looks like every time I
look in the mirror they look a little
bit bigger and I don't know if I'm just
like in my head or what but okay so
here's my verdict I've sat here for ten
minutes and like I looked away from me
or did some other stuff look this up
like the Tyler respond he said I said
guess what I'm working on with the
picture of me with the first step on and
he just wrote clowning because it looks
like you know clouds drove right up oh
I'm gonna marry that man okay so back to
business here so I stepped away for
about ten minutes and I looked up the
price this is from what I saw I think
it's like 48 dollars but I couldn't
really find a direct way to buy it and
I'm not sure when it launches at Sephora
if I find that out I will put it in the
description box once I find that out
so check below if you are interested but
my verdict is if it really is that
expensive I don't know I mean if you
have here's what I'll say I think it
like looking at my upper lip it is a lot
thicker than it usually is like really
truly my bottom lip I'm not sure if it
is because my bottom lip is always kind
of big so it doesn't look that those
will be my top lip if you're really
self-conscious about that and you're
willing to spend the money I think it
actually does plump it I mean it is it's
bigger than it was so I that is kind of
amazing to me and I went a lot farther
up I think
the top that I did on the bottom and
that might be why I don't know so if
you're really subconscious about your
lip size this probably would be a good
option for you if you already have like
midsize or big lips like I do I don't
think you need it I mean it
across the board I don't think you need
a lip plumping thing but I was pretty
amazed and in the era of you know
drawing outside your lips right now that
a lot of people are doing which I don't
like it but I think this is a better
alternative so at least it's gonna look
more natural on you but um I think it's
interesting
thanks to Kaplan MD for sending it to me
of course you guys know I'm not
sponsored that would mean I'd be being
paid to say you know to review it or
anything they just sent it to me for
free I can do what I want with it
so hopefully you found this review
helpful and um you don't probably use it
from time to time because I think it's I
mean it's a cool product and it makes me
laugh and it'd be fun to you know what a
girls and I do with some sisters or some
girlfriends just to do it it does have a
nice feeling it reminds me of the
feeling I get from Bucks and lip glosses
that minty kind of tingly feeling and I
really do think it plumped my upper lips
so I think it's pretty cool and
interesting although it is expensive
like I said I hope this review is
helpful stay tuned for a lot more
reviews I do a lot more drugstore
reviews than high end so subscribe if
you're interested and I'll catch you
guys soon bye it's one of those like
like what do they call it like the
coconut infused or I don't know it's
nice it's okay it is not my favorite
it's not as good as the sweet mint so
this is gonna be a maybe as well this is
gonna be a big video of maybes until the
end what I decide this one is this Pixy
tinted bombs there's literally not
really a tent at all to it I mean truly
I don't know it might like adjust what's
on your lips packaging is cute which is
why I want to keep it however I never
use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
