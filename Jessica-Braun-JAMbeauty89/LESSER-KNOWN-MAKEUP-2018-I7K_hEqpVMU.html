to share with you basically a bunch of
products from lesser-known brands that I
haven't opened yet and I was thinking
I'm like gosh Jessica isn't this just
like a PR haul but I wanted to showcase
brands that maybe don't get as much love
on YouTube or maybe you just don't hear
as much about so a lot of these I would
have to assume are newer releases some
of these I've had for a while so my
original idea that I had was oh I'm just
gonna go find things that I have in my
drawers but I just haven't open yet and
let's try them out let's swatch them
let's look at them give them a little
bit of time breathe some life into them
because otherwise I feel like these
products in front of me are ones that
will end up sitting in there forever
I'll never try them out and then I'll
end up getting rid of them because I
never found out whether they were good
or not you know what I'm saying I guess
for me this is more like let's just open
some makeup together and talk about it
and then I can do maybe an update video
in the future so you know okay now that
I've actually given some time to these
products here's what I think you know
what I mean kind of like a hall update
except for this isn't really a hall so
I'm excited about this video it might be
all over the place I don't know it might
be long it might be short it's probably
gonna be long cuz there's a lot of
products in front of me so let's go
ahead and get into it okay so the first
products I just wanted to try out was
from pop beauty so this is their 24
karat face base and it says it's a
radiance blurring primer do you see this
okay it says this light diffusing primer
blurs imperfections while hydrating and
restoring the skin micronized gold
pearls boost the skin's radiance while
creating a smooth even toned illuminated
base for your makeup Wow
shake before use oh it is a mist okay I
had heard someone ask me about this and
I'd had this for maybe I don't know how
long would they say maybe a month ago
they sent me this and again I put them
in the drawer and just never tried them
and I had one of you guys asked like hey
is this a dupe for the like YSL Touche
Klopp blur primer which I love and so I
was like oh my gosh I have that product
cuz she sent me a picture of this okay
it's a pretty fine mist doesn't really
have a noticeable smell but I mean right
off the bat I have to say no it can't be
an exact dupe because it
I mean it's a spray versus something
that's more of a thicker gel that you're
putting on your face so I'm excited to
try that I'm wondering let me spray it
on my hand if it will end up having like
a yeah the smell is not super noticeable
yeah it does not have the same feel as
the YSL Touche clot um and you don't see
like glitter or anything like that
either just kind of feels wet to be
honest it doesn't so far feel like tacky
like it would hold on to product really
well I like the idea that it's a
glittery primer spray cuz it's basically
what it it well not glitter because you
don't see it but more of a glowy primer
spray cuz I've seen a lot of primer
sprays out there but they're not Chloe
so I'm definitely intrigued to try it
but my skin I don't feel like it looks
glowy at all so hmm I don't know hey
hate to start off on a negative note let
me finish opening it I tried to open so
these so this is the pop beauty makeup
magnet mist energizing and hydrating
setting spray it says it fixes makeup
like a magnet to the skin while
delivering hydration and nutrients it's
got caffeine licorice it says licorice D
puffs vitamin C protects huh same
sprayer which was actually a really nice
sprayer um ooh that's that's quite a so
is this still a primer then no it says
make up finishing I was okay so this is
a mega finishing spray this is more of a
priming spray oh this was a random brand
this is from Emile cordon or cordon it's
their cashmere on lip pop I don't
remember where I got this from how I got
it I know I didn't buy it but I haven't
even opened it oh my gosh look at how
nice that looks
so okay one pot multiple uses apply is a
lip treatment nourishes cuticles I could
definitely use that protect skin soon
after Sun apply daily alone or under
makeup
oh so it oh my gosh this is really nice
nice glass packaging a little thing you
can use to get it out of there oh yeah
it feels kind of like kind of the
consistency of petroleum jelly maybe a
little thinner there's a slow
smell but it's not like super noticeable
nothing that I don't think is gonna
bother you like if you have it on your
lips I could see how this would be
really nice for cuticles minor an
absolute mess right now which is funny
because I'm on prenatal vitamins and
like Evan psycho your nails and hair
would be great I'm like well I'm waiting
on that because anyway so excited to try
this I might put this in my nightstand
because then I can put it on my lips and
on my cuticles cuz that's usually when I
would when I apply cuticle oil that's
when I would do it do you guys know
anything about this brand Emil Gordon
Koki did I have one more thing from this
brand I think I did I'll see if I can
find it
they sent me a few things a long time
ago and I Cokie his soul it's a
drugstore brand and you can just
randomly find it like I found it an
endcap just a small amount of it at a
Meijer near me anyway but they sent me
some stuff and I really didn't try a
bunch of it and buy a bunch I mean I
don't really die trade any of it but now
I'm like again I feel like I should try
it what if it's amazing and you guys
should know about it especially since
it's inexpensive so this is the Cokie
smooth glow hydrating foundation primer
and it's a squeezy tube okay it comes
out white no smell oh it's got it feels
more like okay you know when you have
like a white pointment that you're
putting on like first aid want mint of
some kind that's how it feels like
that's exactly what it feels like that
consistency okay it's a little bit more
of a noticeable small as you rub it in
kind of like it reminds me of my mom's
makeup not in a bad way but it does um
it definitely feels hydrating it really
smooth down my arm hair oh my gosh
that's kind of cool though you almost
feel like it'll do the same thing to
your facial hair you know what I mean um
so it feels hydrating but does kind of
feel a little like I don't want to say
firming cuz I don't mean like it's gonna
firm wrinkles but it kind of feels like
it's like like holding your skin in that
place which I don't know that I like but
again until I try it on my face I'll
have to let you guys know because I love
myself a hydrating primer I love
that this isn't a squeezy tube I think
the packaging is pretty cute okay so
another product is from a brand called
Ilya this is a lot more expensive I
think I had vlog Dan vlog miss about
them sending me a bunch of stuff but I
really I've tried some of it but these
were ones that I have not even tried i
think i swatched them once so these are
their multi sticks and these two are
more blush shades so this one's called
at last and it's you know it's a pretty
color but I just don't know how to wear
blush sticks like I really don't and
this one feels a lot thicker so I feel
like it's gonna be harder to move and I
think that's why like every day when I'm
getting ready my eyes will catch it and
I'm like I don't want to ruin my look
like if I don't apply it well I don't
want to do it on a day that I'm in a
rush and headed to work you know what I
mean and like I said these do feel like
they're a little harder to maneuver this
one's in the shade all of me and this
one's a little bit more sheer just as
you first put it on it's a lot more
peachy so if you're more into that ooh
that one might be the one I try first
cuz I feel like it blends out a little
bit better on my skin and it's a little
less you can barely see it this brand I
was reading about it when they first
sent me stuff and it was saying that
basically the founder was someone that
like her brother all growing up had
really bad allergies and his mom is
always trying to figure out ways to like
find things that he could use that
wouldn't trigger in a reaction and so
she amended this brand that basically
had really good ingredients things like
that but it's expensive probably for
that reason so I'm really trying a lot
of those out I'd love to do a video on
all of it because I've tried a few
things and I haven't been super
impressed but I'm still trying out some
more but it's a brand that I've never
heard anyone talk about and they're
awesome
where they don't support yeah I think
they're on Sephora's website so I was
like huh why he's not talking about oh a
nother coqui product that I just haven't
tried is there strobing palette just
feels so far like kind of standard
drugstore highlighter palette the
oranges shade is a little bit more
powdery than the other four it's not
very highlight II
this is gonna be a really subtle look
now I like subtle looks so I ain't mad
about that I'm really not but if you're
looking it's I think it's odd that they
call it a strobing palette when it's
really not super shimmery it's more just
like lighter shades with a slight
shimmer so I will totally use it
especially for my skin tone these three
shades especially probably this shade
here I mean it just looks like it's
gonna be a nice quick pretty highlight
so I will probably like it but that's
because I know what my cup of tea is if
you will when it comes to highlight but
if you're looking for a highlighter
that's like the BAM this is not gonna do
it for you so interesting another
palette I have opened but not actually
used like at all is from do say and it
came in some box I really don't remember
like it wasn't from this brand it came
in another box with a bunch of other
stuff what palette is it it's called
their free Matic eyeshadow Pro palette
nude I finish so there's a really big
one here and then eight other shades it
looks like you can take these shadows
out so this is like a really pretty but
very subtle gold you can barely see it
it's not like a pigment packed shadow
see about the rest of them they have so
they have like three mats and then the
rest of these are shimmer I don't like
that those move around so easily though
you can't like get a proper swatch um
let's see that's okay um let's swatch
some of the deeper colors the I mean
these colors are right up my alley I
feel like I'm being really negative I
need to like take a chill pill here
because I feel like all of these on my
mmm what's that mean he's like a nice
guy
is that Tommy Boy huh okay anyway um
actually that those packed a decent
amount so I'm gonna definitely try this
this week see how I like it cuz these
colors are totally up my alley
it's nice packaging I don't think this
is a cheap brand I think do say is
expensive so it feels like a nice hefty
pallets Oh
this is what I'm throwing in just cuz I
want to show it to you this is G mocchi
everyone well many people have heard of
it so it's not a lesser known brand by
any means but I wanted to show it to you
because I was like I'm not gonna do a
whole video on this but I had to show
you guys so this they sent to me and
it's their two-tone lipstick in zero one
sculpt in Rouge crazy nice packaging you
roll it up
what so when you swatch it it's red with
this hint of like light blackish purple
so I don't get it like the black is on
the upper so when you do it that means
the black is on the inside that sounds
horrible to me cuz that's just gonna
look like more messy I don't know I
don't get it and here's the thing with a
trendy thing like that with the trendy
idea like this I'm very surprised that
an expensive expensive brand like gee ma
she is doing that because I don't know
you know what I'm saying like I feel
like I could see NYX trying this out or
brands that I don't know maybe I'm maybe
I'm not giving goog enough credit for
being trendy maybe they do this stuff
all the time and I just don't know but I
laughed out loud when I opened that I
thought well that's not up my alley so
I'm putting it back in the box I might
see venue and I know I don't know that's
just so bizarre let me know have you
tried it is it awesome oh this is from
this brand o eiko London which it's not
I mean some people OTT of people have
heard of ICO but it's not talked about
it a lot so this is there me and my
shadow waterproof shadow liner in bronze
so it's just a really pretty you know
kind of cream shadow and stick form
definitely has a lot of pigment you see
if it like blend yeah it blends well
like if you were wanting to blend it
again I could totally see myself taking
this color and putting it all over the
lid blending with my finger and that
being it for my eye shadow just cuz it's
just a nice color it's got a nice shift
of like shimmer to it but nothing crazy
I could even see myself kind of smudging
that on the lower lash line with it so
again this is one that it was totally
lost in my
kind of like single shadow cream shadow
area and I was digging around I'm like I
didn't even know I had this I've never
opened it so I'm so excited I'm doing
this video this is like awesome okay
another brand oh I forgot to open this
one too is from stellar they recently
sent me some stuff I've been trying out
some but again that's a newer brand to
Sephora that some people have talked
about some people haven't really it was
originally talked just when it was first
launched at Sephora some people were
talking about and doing videos and then
that's it there's nothing more
frustrating me when you can't get the
freaking thing off of the lid and you're
trying to pull and hold onto the lid and
it won't rip because the where the
sticker is met to lose it okay calm down
yes so this is the stellar Monica deal
hyper eyeliner pencil so I'm assuming
maybe it's like a collab with that
person whoa it is Supes black it's a
retractable pencil super creamy super
black good because I've recently been
trying some black pencils that I'm like
what in the world like they're terrible
terrible terrible terrible yeah yeah I
got it off that's what you get anyway so
I'm excited that this is one that's
actually good I have some stuff from
Jake at Beauty these are their I feel
like I should shake them up aura glow
liquid highlighter so I have three
shades that they sent so the first one
I'm gonna swatch is called white goddess
and it's just the classic you know
dropper bottle you know liquid
highlighters I feel like so many print
brands can do really well it's always
exciting when you find a shade that
works really well for you I think that's
part of the battle as you know
everyone's making different versions
different shades and if you can find a
shade that works really really well for
you then that you want to just keep
using that one it becomes your favorite
whether or not the formula is any
different than anything else it might
not be but anyway so this oh that is so
pretty
I want to put that on my eyes is called
moonlight really really pretty and then
the last one I have is called Twilight
and it's a lot more of like a golden
bronze oh my gosh these are these are
really pretty I mean holy cannoli oh my
gosh aren't these gorgeous so see I'm
glad I opened these because now I have
an idea
like okay I know that'll be too dark for
me that could probably work and that'd
be like a really be BAM highlight so I
might try for this one first otherwise
they're just sitting in my highlighter
drawer next to everything else not
getting used not open so that is awesome
now I feel like I should move this to my
Emma game ff4 okay so this they actually
have my name on a piece of tape around
it is from this brand called Color Me
and they'd sent me this like color me
like foundation sponge thing that
vibrates and you kind of and it actually
worked pretty well but it they set it
with this underglow hydrator and I just
never opened it so I don't know if it's
like a hydrating primer but see it looks
like there's color to it it says where
this perfecting hydrator for a
flattering natural glow that stays in
place this rose scented formula enhanced
with vitamin b3 offers lightweight
lit-from-within radiance without the
shimmer reflective molecules give the
illusion of smoother more even glowing
skin so it says put it on the clean face
with your finger or use the color me
automatic foundation applicator or even
better coverage wear alone or under
foundation or powder okay
so it sounds like it's like a tinted
primer which the idea of that makes me
laugh so you can you can wear it alone
but they all say you can wear it
underneath I liked the idea though I
mean I haven't watched it yet but like
if it is somewhat decent coverage but
not a lot I like the idea of you know
maybe putting a powder foundation on top
of it and getting the rest of the
coverage you want from that so let's
just see definitely uh oh my that might
not work for my skintone
um of course again the light always
washes it out but it's definitely too
deep and yellow for me the name like
under glow hydrator it's like that um
Gigi Hadid product where it's like a
tinted primer but no you only just put
it where you want bronzer like what no
one's gonna do that I don't have time
for that what are you talking about um
so odd-odd I don't know I mean I guess I
could maybe try it and use like a my
cover FX custom cover drops to like
lighten it and then try it but I'm like
do I really wanna go I don't know this
is in medium so in at0 20
so they had a light that's what I would
have to go for oh the next product is
from Vasanti and I know isn't Vasanti
sold in Canada I don't see it here it's
probably sold online here and again
don't even know where I got this I don't
know if it was in like a box I don't
know
it wasn't from the brand I know that for
sure so maybe this from like whoever
handles their PR like sometimes it's big
companies that handle PR for a lot of
things and they'll send you things from
all the different brands they represent
that would be my guess actually I think
that's where a lot of these came from
just kind of randomly so this is from
Vasanti it's their power oils lip gloss
and eye to shave let me see if the box
says so it says power up your shine
hydrating treatment with power oils
raspberry peach Cola and pomegranate
color that shows up shine that's not
sticky so this deeper shade is called
Queen ooh it hey that color it's really
showing up there it's a really pretty
berry shade perfect winter shade fall
shade whatever and then this shade is I
just said shade way too much Caleb
ooh yeah ooh I would have worn this
today pretty nude color kind of a brown
nude very trendy
is it still trend anymore I don't know I
feel like it's kind of not now so these
feel very I guess they really don't feel
sticky usually with sticky lip gloss you
can kind of feel and tell it really
doesn't feel sticky and as I kind of
blend them out a little bit more they
kind of become a sheer wash of color but
it's still really pretty and I like that
there's like good oils in it to at least
help moisturize your skin because
there's nothing worse than putting on a
lip gloss and after an hour or two your
lips are getting drier and it's mixing
with that gloss and it's just looking
weird so that sounds awesome
I'm totally gonna try these out another
lip product I wanted to try is from girl
lactic Beauty and this is their matte
lip paint let's see
and I do hear some youtubers talk about
girl lactic that's for sure so they're
not quite as lesser-known and of course
I mean the odds of you hearing about
many of these brands is high but like I
said I feel like they're not these are
not always mentioned on YouTube as much
as like benefit to face tart like all
the big ones that you hear about all the
time so this is in the shade posh
oh very very very very pigmented really
pretty color I mean that was like I mean
that's insane
it's crazy pigmented a really kind of
thin creamy formula it just glides right
on like a lot of liquid lipsticks do so
really pretty packaging - same with the
Vasanti this is pretty as well
anything else Jesse so those are all of
the products I'm gonna mention today if
you like this kind of a I don't even
know what to call it kind of a first
impressions for lesser known brands yeah
that's what I should call it anyway if
you like this kind of a video give me a
thumbs up comment below let me know why
you like it or if you think ooh let's
maybe you should do this kind of a video
or the same idea but do this spin on it
let me know because your guys's ideas
are amazing some of my best videos came
from ideas you guys gave me so I always
appreciate that I do read all of my
comments whether or not I have time to
respond because I also have a full-time
job that's the tricky part but other
than that I hope you'll subscribe in the
meantime and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
