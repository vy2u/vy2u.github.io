doing something a little bit different
for our video we are going to go to the
drugstore and we're going to go shopping
the last time I did a video like this
was an anti haul drugstore edition and I
went to Target showed you guys products
that I was not interested in buying I
will link that below it was so fun and a
lot of you guys loved watching it so I
thought why don't I do this for like an
actual vlog and just like bring you guys
along with me shopping and picking out
products so I don't know that there's
going to be a lot to gain from this
video I can't review the products you
know if I haven't tried them and you
know it really is just going to be face
value you're just shopping with me but I
figured it just might be fun so I
hopefully will subscribe and let's go
shopping we are at Target so here's
something I've never tried they're cute
swatches on my hand oh my gosh they're
lending sponge from elf I've ever tried
it so that how much is that six dollars
that's not too bad I'm excited to give
that a try
I have no idea how it is I'm kind of
curious about these vissa and X timer
spray I've never even heard of it so I'm
curious to see how it he'll work also
there's always kids yelling and targeted
every time I mirror it curious about
this I feel like I never try Neutrogena
products and then when I do I'm always
like loving them so this is it's good
for your skin as well as concealed also
shameless plug this would be best put
eyeliner in the drugstore I want to buy
another one there's literally one left
maybe outside because it is the best
I've ever tried drugstore high end
doesn't matter it's the best so there's
this like entire clearance section right
here I'm avoiding it I will end up
buying something and it'll be something
that I don't even care about but I took
a deal and I'm like what are you no no
I'm not really wanted it's that bad
anyone know if it's any good things I've
never heard that either I don't think
I'm gonna get him though I just don't
really have like a huge interest in them
I'm also interested in this I don't want
to get it because I feel like I've tried
to insurance reform all and I don't know
so kind of on the fence mister of my
favorite drugstore with these a long
time this is my been a spicy blush these
are so comfortable and so beautiful
there's some other old school drug store
like primer this is been around for
quite a while anyone tried it is any
good if you never tried it
I'm so curious I have to be honest so it
looks like old because I don't know how
long these I stay here but I think I
might get this and give it a try it's
like a classic in the drugstore so this
trick see highlighter in London luster
is like my favorite so I want to try the
santorini sunset it looks so pretty
sorry it's like dark because it's so
bright that makes sense but I'm so
excited to try this
so covergirl gets all that I don't know
all that my only only get no mushroom
poor all day my gosh I'm so trying this
I'm so curious if this works
that stinks if it looks crazy I'm by I
figure I'll get 100 another thing I'm
curious about I think if I keep seeing
randomly like we're talking about gays
in liqueurs I feel like you didn't help
for a while hello I kinda want to try it
I got a friend my shade I'm thinking 20
much kind of in the tool she could work
I could lighten that up that's we need
to okay so I think that's everything I'm
getting unless I like find something
else but I'm also getting poisonous
because they have the livers I like
they're like kinda like thicker than
normal but I think it's like a really
weird and awesome exhibition it
definitely tons of different ways of
times
yay that was awesome and I'm so excited
to try those goodies out I want to let
you guys know via snapchat or other
social media are probably probably in a
hall update video how I like them how
they're working for me if you enjoy this
style of video give it a thumbs up let
me know your thoughts down below in the
comments and I hope you'll subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
