going to share with you my review and my
all-day trial using lips sense if you
haven't heard lips tense it is
everywhere
one of those things that like if you
ever were to go to their website it's an
independent distributor kind of a
company like Avon and Mary Kay they sell
other makeup products but their best
sellers are their lipsticks I want
pricing info as well as the subscriber
that sent me that she's an independent
distributor so I will put her
information below because you do have to
buy these through people get to go
online on a website and buy it like you
would on Amazon or Sephora you have you
can still buy it online but you have to
buy it through a distributor so I will
have her info below as well as pricing
all of that kind of stuff I have one two
three four colors and I'm going to wear
one of these all day long and I'm going
to do check-ins and let you guys see how
well it wears throughout the day but
first we need to put it on so the color
I'm choosing to wear is one of their
bestsellers its praline rose and I also
have their oops remover which you it is
very hard to get this stuff off at the
end of the day so you do need this and I
know that they sell kits so I have two
of their glosses I have their regular
moisturizing gloss but I also have their
moisturize and gloss that's matte and
the other shades I have by the way are
blue red which is a really nice cool
toned red I also have this Fly Girl
which is a little bit more of a deeper
red and then I have violet which is a
very kind of shimmery almost metallic
look to it but I'm going to use praline
rose so please keep in mind I know a lot
of people use this up and they probably
know more about it than I do I've done
as much research as I can I've been
trying these out for like a month or two
so I really do have strong feelings
about them but first I'm going to zoom
you in I'm going to apply this you guys
can see how it apply when I first put
this stuff on it burned like crazy and
my lips are a little bit chapped I'm
actually going to put on a scrub I have
a this is from Milani to keep it sweet
lip scrub my lips are a little bit chat
so I'm just going to kind of scrub my
lips for a second get all the dead skin
off stuff smells
amazing okay so my lips are not perfect
but it's better than it was so it's just
a doe foot applicator and it you do have
to put on a couple of layers I think it
says specifically apply in one direction
beginning with the outside corner of the
mouth apply three layers letting each
try three to five seconds and then you
finish it with the gloss so let's go and
get started
I get like nervous oh it does smell like
alcohol and it kind of feels like you're
putting alcohol on your lips
so there's layer one it's funny because
the more you put on the the bolder the
colors I really does burn though I've
read a little bit about how they say the
burn is not a bad thing and actually the
ingredients in it are fine but I have to
admit like it is a very pungent smell a
very Burnie feel to it whether I just
scrubbed my lips or not it always feels
like that so it does dry you can kind of
feel it drawing your lips so let's do
our second coat
yeah that's going to keep your list of
art because they stick to you alright
third coat
I like this color because I hold on I
can't really talk so now we're going to
put the gloss on top because it is
almost sticky on the inner part until
you do put this off I'm using my
moisturizing gloss it's my favorite it
instantly feels so much better at this
point the color is sealed in I can do
this and nothing comes off its a gloss
so that's what's crazy about it is even
if you're rushing in the morning you can
get this stuff on really really quickly
and it's there and every time I've worn
something like this my lips look pretty
good most of the day I do like to
reapply about halfway through it I'm a
teacher so I'm talking and drink coffee
water you know rushing through lunch
so it is nice to reapply that I have
gone just last week I went the entire
school day without reapplying and you
could definitely see somewhere in the
middle but it didn't look horrible
so I mean it's absolutely possible but
if you can reapply once the millage egg
that's can be ideal but I'm going to go
ahead and go about my day I've got some
videos to film and some other things to
do but I'm going to check in with you
guys every so often and we'll see how it
looks by the end of the day okay so it
is 11:30 3 I just finished putting this
on and I'm going to film a bunch of
videos we will check in it looks a lot
darker in this lighting I'm using my
phone right now doesn't it but like I
said you can't see anything it really is
amazing so in that respect it's awesome
but I will show you how it looks okay so
it is 1:45 so it's been a little over
two hours and I think it's still looking
pretty good I've been drinking coffee
and water I think it's still looking
pretty good so the one thing I don't
love is that especially with the color
like this I feel like I can't get as
precise of a line around my lips you
know what I mean so it is what it is but
it's staying really well I don't think
there's like any where there I mean a
little bit but I feel like that's how it
was when I first applied it so so far so
good I just filmed a bunch of video so
I'm just that mess of alarming so I've
got a clean
up and then we're planning to go look at
furniture and kind of furniture shop
really more like price gauge for a
couple of hours here in a little while
at some furniture store so I'll check in
in a little bit okay it is 3:17 and I
just ate a bunch of pita chips and
hummus and drink some water and it's
still looking pretty good
I don't think it's like perfect but it's
not bad by any means so we're headed out
to go furniture shop price gauge
etcetera so I'll check in in a little
bit but here's a close-up it's alright
not too bad okay so we're at Five Guys
because we wanted orders and put it in
but we're going to bring home flat I
wanted to check in let me show you like
in the light it really doesn't look too
bad
the only thing I've reapplied is the
gloss I haven't reapplied the color at
all and it doesn't feel great though but
this is one of those colors that even
though it's wearing off in the middle
but you can't tell as much because of
the color so it's kind of perfect for
that whereas I think if it were like one
of the bright reds UBL it's a little bit
more that it's wearing down in the
middle but I'm going to eat the burger
when we get home so here in a little bit
I'll check in again Tyler what time is
it just for the sake of this you cooking
up the time but 6:17 but it does feel
dry it's not super comfortable you can
put the gloss on feels a little bit
better but it's still it could be worse
like they're really drying liquid
lipsticks by this point in the day feel
horrible but these I mean it's not
comfortable but it's not terrible
alright so we just watched an episode of
Bob's Burgers you can see and we are
tired and I feel bad because it's
daylight out but we're talking about
going to pretend it's like what time is
it Tyler do you know okay it's 7:10 we
might be going to bed but here's a
close-up you can see where it's worn off
there right and again there's no
transfer whatsoever once you put it on
the very first time if I were to reapply
it really would improve things so like
if I just put one
our coton especially in that area I've
done that numerous times with any of the
colors and it always looks so much
better then you can feel it again with
the gloss so I would say ideally with
this the best-case scenario is bring it
with you and maybe four or five hours
into the day reapply it with the glass
icon and you'll be good until the end of
your work day if you're going out at
night you honestly might be okay all
night long but if you're like drinking
or eating you might want to reapply but
I mean most people are not any closer to
me then this is right now you really
can't tell and I think that's what's so
cool about it is if you're just looking
for a lip color to do exactly that to
make you look put together look a little
bit more cohesive pull your lips
together I think this is perfect for
that and then you have the option to
reapply if you know people might be
closer to you or it's really starting to
wear off kind of weird but I'm really
impressed with it it's the best lip
stain I've ever tried
now the Rimmel double sided one they're
provocate those are pretty close they
are a different formula it doesn't burn
but it also doesn't last as long on the
lips but that's a great drugstore option
if you don't have the money for this you
don't want to order it you know whatever
but I'm really impressed like I said
it's the best I've ever tried out of all
the different ones they have and I like
these better than liquid lipsticks
that's right down because those are even
more drying I mean really truly so I
have to give it my recommendation I
think you know I own four colors this is
obviously my favorite I like the more
wearable colors but if you're going to
wear a red lip it's amazing as well
because you don't want that you know
going outside your lip line or anything
like that I would just recommend maybe
with that the first time you put it on
maybe line your lips just you can make
sure you have a crisp line the lip liner
will probably wear off throughout the
day but at least it's a little bit
crisper than it would be without it
okay so I've washed my face and I just
used here I'll show you what I use to
remove this I just use my it's from
Pixie I use the cleansing oil balm and I
use that to remove all my makeup and I
did it over that and got a good amount
of it off that you can still see
anywhere I had dryness it just like
leeches on to so this is where I'll
usually go in this is the lip color
remover and
if I can get rid of it I'm just going to
put it on my lips completely and it says
just to put it on and then wipe it off
so here's a tissue I don't really know
definitely is taking Sun at all I don't
know that it's getting at all and I
would say if you can't get the rest of
it off just get like a lip scrub over
the lip scrub the one that I used
earlier the Milani keep it smooth the
one I love that stuff I would say you
can see how dry my lips are though I
need to put a lip balm on top so I would
say after you wear it definitely put a
really moisturizing lip balm like I love
the CEO Bigelow my favorite night balm
is so so good for your lips
I like the rebbe's Amiel from nooks in
UX II and what else do I really like oh
the Hanalei lip treatment is really good
you have to order that online I can put
links to all these products below but
they're just some of my favorite lip
balms that are really really
moisturizing on your lips so I wanted to
bring up a dupe that it's not an exact
dupe but if you're willing something
similar but you don't have the money to
go buy that the Rimmel provocative are
pretty close now they don't last as long
but it's the same idea where you have
the stain color on one side and then you
have the gloss color on the other they
have a decent amount I do think there's
a little bit of transfer but not too
badly and I know they're like every
drugstore brand makes products like
these where some of them are in two
separate products like the lips and I do
think lip fence is probably the
strongest staying power and like you
know no transfer at all almost instantly
so they really do win the game when it
comes to that but if you're on a budget
or you need something quickly these are
pretty darn good and then I mean
literally like everything I know
covergirl has a two set thing and I used
a long time ago that was very similar to
these so definitely check your drugstore
if you don't have time to order one you
need it soon or maybe you just on a
budget and you don't want to spend that
much money so if you're interested in
these definitely check my links below
