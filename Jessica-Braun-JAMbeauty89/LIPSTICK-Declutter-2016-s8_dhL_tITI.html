have a feeling that I am going to need
to split this video up because I do want
to swatch most of these because I know I
like when people do that inde clutters
these are my lip liners I've got like
lip balms here my lipsticks oh that goes
over here and then lip glosses and like
some actual you know like matte lip
things so I'm gonna organize these I
think we will start with lipsticks and
let's just see where we go from there
okay so here are all my lipsticks i
declutter these all the time so like
literally in a given month I get rid of
like five lipsticks so this is already
pretty pared down to be honest but I
still feel like I've got too much and to
be honest I have like this is an entire
set of Urban Decay ones that they sent
me and I have another one of Smashbox in
another whole set of bare minerals that
I haven't even touched at all so I'm not
going to declutter them because I want
to actually review them swatch them that
goes the same for these Urban Decay ones
I haven't swatched these these are their
megamat no these are their new lipsticks
and so there's like the comfort mattes
there's mega mattes creams all kinds and
they sent me I think ten of their shades
and I haven't swatched them yet so I do
want to actually do a swatch video with
them first before I get rid of any now
I'll tell you right off the bat I
probably will only keep a couple like
backtalk is this comfort matte and it
looks like a shade I would actually wear
whereas some of these I know I probably
like this is in despair see this I will
certainly swatch but I probably won't
keep because for me it's not quite right
for what like my style is um firebird
that looks like fun Wow so these are
really really creamy really incredible
I'll swatch them for you while we're at
it this is in 714 this is one of their
mega mattes
this one was a little bit harder to get
started there but look at that
pigmentation that's a beautiful Taylor
Swift red this isn't disturbed and it's
one of their comfort mattes yeah like
this is one I probably well I don't know
that's kind of cool though but I
probably won't keep that was really
really creamy this one is in pandemonium
and it's one of their mega mattes as
well it's like a purple probably won't
keep that this is in BIGBANG and it's
one of their metallized ones so there's
like glitter I don't really love the
glitter I don't think that's a great
idea to be honest with you but it's a
pretty color but again I don't know
this is a in menace and it's one of
their comfort mats oh that one was
really smooth
that's probably one I'll keep this is a
naked and it's one of their creams oh
I'll probably keep that too that's
really really pretty and then lastly for
this
this is Rocksteady and it's a cream as
well well that's a pretty one so there
are some like the Reds I'll probably
keep I like the pink and naked and that
one but the rest I probably will get rid
of but again I don't want to get rid of
them until I've done that video if I
decide to do it and if I decide not to
then I'll go ahead and get rid of the
ones I know I don't want so if I were
pretending I would get rid of there were
the ones I know I didn't want the
glitter one let's see where were those
really conspiracy the purple one the
other dark one disturbed I would get rid
of those firebird I think I would get
rid of but I think I would keep the two
really neutral ones naked and backtalk I
would keep those Rocksteady was that
last one I think is really pretty Menace
is this one here I would keep and 714 is
that one so if I were pretending that's
what I would keep let's go ahead and
keep the today let's keep going in the
front row so these are my two Marc
Jacobs lipsticks and this is like my
favorite lipstick formula of all time so
this is my favorite favorite it's an O
Maile and it's a really creamy read and
I just I love it so much I so so much
even my husband likes this one this
one's an infamous and it's just a really
classic everyday kind of color so I'm
definitely keeping both of those they're
two of my favorites this is a bare
minerals lipstick and chase your dreams
and I love the packaging I feel like I
have no like I feel like I have a lot of
lipsticks this color but it is really
creamy and like it's not a matte which I
kind of like because I feel like so many
people are wearing mattes and I'm just
kind of tired of them so I'm gonna this
is gonna be a maybe pow right there this
is the YSL rouge developed in number one
and it's just a really pretty everyday
color it is a little bit lighter
than my lips but it kind of blends in
really nicely I used to have another one
of these but I ended up getting rid of
it because I just wasn't wearing it very
often but this one I am going to keep
this is the boots number seven Moisture
drinks drench lipstick and romantic I
love it it's just such a simple everyday
color it's one of my favorites
definitely keeping this is the Rimmel
London one and airy-fairy very similar
to that just a little bit more Pinker a
little bit more pink I should say this
formula I think is creamy when you first
apply it but I think it does kind of dry
my lips out throughout the day I love
this shade I can't get rid of it yet
this one the KT cap matte and sphinx
it's the only one I did that video on
these but it's the only one I kept but
honestly you guys it's like the exact
same color as airy-fairy and I think I
like the formula of airy-fairy butter so
I think I might pass this one this is
the Rimmel Kate lipstick in number 45
you're gonna notice a trend these are
literally all the same color oh my gosh
that's insane
do you guys see that they're the exact
same so do I need both Rimmel's I will
say the airy-fairy one and this one are
like literally the same and the kate one
is newer and I've had airy-fairy for a
while so maybe I will get rid of
airy-fairy and just keep this one that's
insane
so this is the it cosmetics genocide
quoi lip balm and your perfect pink so
actually it's a lip balm oops but it's
clear and it supposedly becomes like the
right shade for your lips so I want to
try this out some more this one I
thought I already decluttered this this
is the maybelline superstay lipstick and
infinite iris I had high hopes for this
but this was really bad I used to love
another shade in this line a long time
ago that's it right there but it wasn't
glittery like this one is and it I love
the smell the if you haven't smelled
these lipsticks they smell like the best
lipstick I've ever smelled in my life
but it's just a really bad formula so
I'm definitely getting rid of that one
this is brand new to me this is the bite
Beauty lipstick and fig and just a
comfortable formula really pretty pink
color so I'm definitely keeping that
this is the max sock pose and lipstick
that is subscriber sent to me and it's a
beautiful matte pink and a really
actually decently comfortable matte
formula so I'm definitely keeping that
this is the Revlon pink in the afternoon
or my favorite lipsticks of all time
definitely keeping if you haven't bought
this yet you're crazy it's literally the
best lipstick in the drugstore this is
the Rimmel the only one lipstick and
it's a keeper and this one I was so
disappointed in just I don't know I
can't decide if it's the color or the
formula that I didn't like but I just
was not impressed I'm getting rid of
that one this MAC lipstick I just bought
in patisserie it's just oh boy it's just
like those not that one though but it's
just like those maybe a little bit more
peachy but I love it I just bought it
this is the Chanel lipstick in number
424 and it's just a pink lipstick I
realized though I don't really like the
way this looks on me so this might be
one I passed on which I cannot believe I
am but I just don't I feel like if I'm
gonna have a Chanel lipstick I need to
make sure it's a shade I love and I just
don't love this so I never wear it and
this one in protest this is an urban
decay one and see it's actually a little
bit different than other ones I have
it's a really creamy formula I think I
am gonna keep that one we kind of
glanced back through these make sure I
want to keep all of these yeah I think I
do and I think if this is a maybe for me
I'm just gonna get rid of it so there we
go
so yeah even though the Urban Decay ones
I'm not necessarily getting rid of right
this second I know that genuinely I
probably really will get rid of those
five so that's what I'm getting rid of
this is what I'm keeping I don't think
that's too bad and I'm sure as I use
these more I probably won't keep every
single one of those we'll see but I
think that's not too bad I actually am
really proud of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
