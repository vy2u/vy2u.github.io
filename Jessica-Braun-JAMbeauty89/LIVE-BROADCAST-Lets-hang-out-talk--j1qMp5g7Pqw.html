hey everyone its Jessica I don't know if
this is actually on it says live guys
I'm like actually nervous I've never
done one of these before and so as I'm
like clicking through the Google+ like
how to do a hangout on air and like what
am i doing like I don't know how to do
this and so when I was just about to
click like start rocking assess like I
am nervous like I don't know why I was
so so nervous but I really don't know
how to do this so like I don't know
where to look if you guys have questions
or so like I'm just figuring this out as
we go this is probably a great idea
where why mmm-hmm think okay hold on let
me let me figure this out we might have
to start this over I have no idea how to
do this so today I had like a really
early morning and I had a birthday party
for my nephew and just all kinds of
things it was so much fun we went to
this place where they were like all
these bouncy houses and it was it was
just fun it was so cute okay I might
have to stop this and redo it because I
don't know how actually to do it maybe
I'm doing it right you guys feel like
such a dumb-dumb how can I teach
children if I don't know how to run this
I think I'm doing it right so if you are
watching I think I figured out where
questions appear there's like a little
thing on this side I'm doing this I was
actually inspired because one of my
favorites Jen loves reviews here on
YouTube I love her she had done a video
like this last weekend and I was like
what
so I watched it and it had been already
recorded but it was alive when she was
doing it and I'm assuming she was the
same thing I don't house do it but it
was so much fun to watch and she was
just talking I don't know I just love
that so okay I see their viewers I see
the number of viewers and I'm trying to
figure out where the Clanton's are okay
yay okay thank you
okay wait Oh what did I do okay so I'm
currently so Julia Porter she said if
you see this you're in the right section
for questions
yeah I did it right okay good so far
that's the only question Thank You Julia
you are number one hmm
right now my I'm sorry
you know the lighting looks terrible
maybe I shoulda just let me see if I can
get the blinds ask me questions guys
hold on a minute get the blinds down
that's a little bit better look at my
forehead it is not that greasy you guys
oh this is too fun though
why is my forehead look so crazy okay
wait where's the chat hey everybody can
you hear me typing thank you all right
okay I keep forgetting this is live I'm
like Jess you better not like pick your
nose or anything so ask me questions
find the chat on the side or the QA
thing and ask me stuff because I don't
know what to talk about I mean I could
just talk I'm about to do yay Sarah Jane
Griffin said I found it Lou
so while I'm waiting for your lovely
lovely questions everybody I went to the
Dollar Tree okay you guys know I've been
doing those solid tree hauls well I went
again because I was getting other like
ingredients and things and I found
Polly's lipstick here on YouTube she
talks about these rivo lip balms and
this one it says chapped ice which is
the brand that I always see at the
Dollar Tree but this one says Revo on it
so I guess it's Revo brand I have no
idea isn't that bizarre but I got a red
one and a green one does it say that
like a watermelon cherry and then I
don't know what flavor this is I got a
pink one too so I was so excited they're
like the mini yeah they're like the
miniature ones but they're so good oh my
gosh they're so good I was so excited
about that them hi okay so thank you to
Sarah G and I'm just gonna click through
hello - Oliver Sanchez hello and Sarah
Jane Griffin face of the day so today
I'm laugh and still at my forehead so
I'm wearing actually the NYC BB cream
instant Matt and I had done a review of
this on my channel I have done where I
compared it to the elf one and I in the
video when I did it I liked the alcohol
but I think I've decided that I actually
like the NYC one better just because
it's a little more almost gray toned
which works with my skin a little bit
better and it is a little more
mattifying so I'm wearing that and then
I'm wearing this everyday minerals cheek
in Primrose which I bought I'm Vitacost
which I'll be doing if I to cost haul
soon and you'll see I got a bunch of
everyday minerals products else that I
get trying to think oh I tried out my if
you follow me on Instagram I had tried
out this Too Faced ala mode eyes I got
it was like $18 on sale on their website
and it's got all these kind of crazy
colors that I probably will never wear
but I'm wearing some of these on my eyes
today
like there's cote d'azur I have no idea
how to say that that I'm wearing like in
my crease and then I used a bunch of
these different like lighter colors but
it's really nice what else that I use
today hmmm oh I also on the Too Faced
say oh I got the Too Faced lemon drop
shadow insurance and that was it's like
a yellow toned primer and I really like
this I used today and it's supposed to
color correct that way but it also
primes it's like it's perfect it be as
if you're using concealer for it but
it's also meant to prime your eyes and I
really really liked using it today and
it was on sale on Too Faced website for
like nine dollars so I was very excited
about these purchases let me tell you
but I already love their the Too Faced
shadow insurance regular so there's that
Oh on my lashes I'm wearing the essence
I love extreme or iheart extreme you
guys this stuff is amazing I put this on
of course now it's not looking as great
but I put this on you know at like 7:00
in the morning and it's now 3:30 my time
so it's lasted the curl and everything
has lasted I think pretty darn well and
especially considering this is like 399
at Walgreens or Kmart or wherever what
else am i wearing today I don't really
know I really didn't wear a lot okay so
wait I'm lost so that well what else am
i wearing I guess I can think about
before I answer the other questions
Oh on my eyebrows I'm still wearing my
Anasazi when I have my Knicks in which I
tried but I really do need to get the
right shade and if you don't know what
I'm talking about
the Anasazi eyebrow is is the one I
loved forever and I have I'm wearing it
medium brown but it's really expensive
so NYX has their one called their NYX
micro pencil and I got it in the shade
taupe and it's okay but it's not quite
the same I'll kind of show you this is
the NYX taupe and then this is I have a
feeling when I'm done doing this this is
gonna be a stupid run mess so that is
the Anasazi one and that is Nick Stokes
so I need to get one closer to so if you
know of one of the NYX shades that is
closer to the medium brown and Anastasia
oh yeah
because I'll buy another one because I
the formula is great and I swear it
really is just like the Anasazi one it's
just the color is not right so that's
what I'm wearing and all my lips and I
might apply more is this echo Bella it's
in the shade piece again I got this on
Vitacost you guys will see this in the
hall but it's just like a really natural
looking color like it's kind of a peachy
Brown nude but it actually looks okay
when you've got fair skin like me
because some of the brown nudes can make
you look crazy like just weird so very I
was excited I got another shape which is
called pleasure and it's a really really
pretty pink color but I haven't really
worn it but one thing about these
because they are more natural they're
really thin which I don't mind because
it makes it more like not sticky that
how did it take me that long to come of
that it just makes it not as sticky like
it feels like I may be wearing lip balm
maybe wearing nothing I really like I
love the way it looks okay where am I at
dan dan duh I had an evil thank you Alex
and the monsters and then Alby said
found it
okay so jad e95 did I say that right she
said did you eat your March FC bag she
just got hers no but I know that it's in
the mail they sent me that email that
it's you know your your if she bag is on
its way but I kind peeked at my glam
room and I am really excited and frankly
I feel like you guys know I love if C
and I love boxycharm a box these terms
more expensive
and at this point now I'm getting both
of them free ripsi I had paid for for
the longest time and boxycharm
they've always sent it to me for free
and actually it's kind of they have a
soft spot and spot my heart because they
had contacted me to send me free boxes
when I had a very small channel so that
was I mean they just kind of I would
like to say they kind of took a chance
on me and it was I don't know I just
have soft spots in my heart for company
that were willing to send me things even
when I didn't have a big channel and I
didn't have a lot of money as if I have
a lot of money now Who am I kidding oh
my gosh but when I really didn't have a
job like now I'm a teacher but when I
first started I was not a teacher yes so
I was really struggling for money anyway
so boxy charms awesome but if see I feel
like keeps getting better and better and
it's only ten dollars a month so I'm
really excited to see what's in mind but
I kind of peaked and it seems awesome so
okay thanks for asking that
Sierra Lombardo asked well she said this
isn't a question but I thought I'd tell
you I love your videos nearthe gorgeous
thank you very much I'm glad that you
thank you for calling me gorgeous I feel
like a goofball but thank you but thank
you mostly for loving my videos I enjoy
making them so much and actually the
reason I'm doing this now is because I
film a lot of videos at one time because
I am a teacher and it I just I swear I
just run out of time like there's no
time so I I film a lot of videos at one
time and I'll kind of upload them as I
can and as I can edit them and he's
borrowing our really good camera the
Canon t5i now and we don't live together
yet and so he's burning it right now so
I'm like ah I want to film like I just
feel like talking to you guys and I
couldn't without that so I'm like I'm
gonna look into this thing so I'm really
glad I did cuz this is a lot of fun even
though I'm still kind of nervous talking
you guys and like I hope I don't say
something well I'll probably say a
million dumb things but whatever okay
let's see I'm trying to make sure I'm
going in order I don't know oh I I did
that one I'm clicking select okay so
Adi Jeeva I'm sorry if I say your name
wrong she said um wait what did I click
on oh no she said okay I I'm I clicked
on the wrong one where did it go
Sarah Jane Griffin said wedding update
okay guys our wedding is almost planned
it's June 20th and I am so excited and
we're
keeping it small although the guestlist
has grown a little bit and that's okay
but it's so under a hundred people it
was originally like 50 and we'll see how
many people actually come but we're
keeping it really really small mostly
just family and really really close
friends and we've we're way under budget
I am so excited about that now I know a
lot of people have asked you know how
are you keeping it like we're our budget
really we've only spent like three
thousand dollars is about what we will
spend but it's not necessarily because
I'm I mean I am cutting corners a lot
but mostly because we've been so blessed
with friends that can do stuff for us
like Tyler's brother is a DJ so he's
DJing for free and my brother is a
caterer and so he's catering for free
and my one of our best friends makes as
a costume designer and makes dresses for
a living so he's making my wedding dress
and I he just sent me a mock-up of it
and it is gorgeous and it's exactly what
I wanted so we have been very blessed in
that department one of my good friends
from well not good friends but one of my
friends from high school and really from
all growing up he is a photographer so
he is doing our photography session our
you know our wedding for way cheaper
than he normally would so we've been
very very very blessed but it's all
coming along and I am I am so excited to
marry that man I am so excited to live
with him and every day that goes by I
think we're one day closer and the
hardest thing I think I'm gonna get
teary-eyed again as usual the hardest
thing I think is at the end of the night
like I don't want to leave and he
doesn't either but we have to say
goodnight and goodbye and then so I'm so
I'm really crying out and I can't even
edit this out I so I am so excited to
not have to say goodbye every night that
is what I'm looking forward to I mean a
million other things but that and for
traveling with him and I'm so excited
for our honeymoon and Jessica stop
crying anyway so thanks for asking that
Sarah Jean it is going very well the
wedding planning then okay um now Adi
Jeeva I know I said your name earlier
she asked any good blushed for
recommendations for beginners oh I'm
excited let's see I gotta get my tears
in check okay for beginners so when I
think of a makeup beginner like I was
not that long ago I would think of
blushes that maybe aren't too pigmented
and also that are inexpensive but that
aren't too pigmented because then you
don't have to worry about having a heavy
hand accidently you can just kind of
brush it on and it'll always look good
so some of my favorite kind of not as
pigmented blushes let me pull out a few
and they're all drugstore there so
they're all so good letsa be real okay
I've got a few so what a mine is one
that no one talks about this is the
covergirl cheekers and I have in the
shade I can never find it Oh natural
twinkle and these are like I don't know
five or six bucks at the drugstore I
hate that the packaging it comes with
this little brush which is okay but it's
not really gonna do exactly what you
want I would say buy an elf
couple dollar brush but it's such a
pretty like just like pink with a little
bit of shimmer you probably can't even
see it because it really is it's not
crazy yeah you can't see it it's not
crazy pigmented like every other blush
that I own but I love that about it
because when it's just a kind of
fresh-faced day or if you're a beginner
it's just so nice and another one that I
like that has a little more pigmentation
to it is the L'Oreal True Match blush
and this one is in Tender rose and again
it's a almost the exact same shade but
it's so it's got a little bit more
pigmentation you can kind of see that
but they both have kind of a natural
shimmer to them but not necessarily
glitter and I just love these and both
of these are under $10 and I think they
would be fantastic
another one that I thought of is the
master glaze just because if you're
wanting to get into cream products these
are so pretty this one is in barely pink
and again the same type of color which i
think is just a flattering shade kind of
universally and you can't really screw
it up so that's what I would recommend
those are some favorites of mine if
you're wondering what tea I'm drinking
it's the yogi it's it's called the
muscle muscle recovery and Tyler and I
are training for the mini marathon right
now here in Indianapolis and it's there
I mean it's a half marathon so it's 13.1
miles and I've never run that far ever
and I ran the most I've ever run last
weekend which was eight miles and I did
it without stopping I could have cried
when we finished because I couldn't
believe I did it and it was one of the
things I hope it doesn't sound braggy I
was so proud of myself like I didn't
think I could do it
and I did I was just very proud
regardless we've been running you know
pretty much every day following the Nike
running app like training program and so
this tee has been like saving my life
it's the muscle recovery tee from yogi
which I know I already said and I buy
mine from Vitacost me you can buy it
anywhere but it's just nice it's got
stuff in it I don't remember exactly but
it's got stuff in it this supposedly
helps kind of recover your muscles but
also helps give you a little more energy
you know because you're tired if you've
been working oh no ok ok
I'll be way are we sorry I'm going to
Boston New York and Washington DC this
summer any recommendations okay I've
never been to Boston but I have been in
New York and DC now New York I would
recommend you know there's so many this
is probably the most obvious I'm gonna
leave it in New York a few times and it
was well I was older I mean I was grown
up but it was usually for like auditions
on Broadway or actually callbacks I've
been very blessed regardless it was
usually for things like that so I was
very busy and I was only there for a
short amount of time and I had to go
back to Chicago where I lived at the
time but one thing that I would
recommend is slow down because there's
so much to see and you'll never be able
to see it also just do a few things and
you don't have to do all the classic
things just be out there and just
explore wherever you're saying anywhere
near there I mean there really it's
insane how overwhelming it can be and I
remember the first time I went I thought
oh I got to do this and I got to do this
and I got to do this and it's the same
in any big city like that but just slow
down
and breathe in the area you're staying
in because sometimes you'll be saying
you know kind of more outside of the
outside of mid-time Midtown and there's
so much cool stuff outside of Midtown I
mean most of the cool stuff I would say
is out of there so you don't feel like
you have to go right to Times Square and
all those places you should see them
once in your life but most of the fun
stuff that's not touristy is outside of
there so explore those regions I'm
trying to give myself that same advice
because when we go to Paris for a
honeymoon in a few other places
yes I want to see the Eiffel Tower but I
also want to do all those little things
outside of there so if you live in Paris
or you've been and you have
recommendations of kind of smaller
restaurants or just smaller pockets or
neighborhoods we should stay in let me
know DC I only went when I was a lot
younger so I really I mean I just
remember doing all the touristy things
and it was so much fun and the museum's
I don't care what anyone says are so fun
because I'm a history nerd I love it but
I would say you know get guidebooks and
find out how everything is laid out but
once you've got that then ditch the
guidebook and do what you want that's
what I would recommend for any City get
to know the city and the way it's laid
out mark a few things that you know you
want to do but then leave time to do
other things that are just sporadic and
spontaneous all right Beth Hastings I
adore you thank you are you excited to
set up your new Beauty room or video
area in your new place with Tyler oh you
know me too well yes I think what we're
gonna do cuz we're just getting a
two-bedroom is you know we'll have our
bedroom but we're just gonna have one
room that serves as both of our rooms
because he films - he's got his Travel
Channel and so I think we might do it
kind of like a half my office half his
office and so when I've got the camera
on me it's got my stuff behind me and
then vice versa for him so we'll see how
that works out at first I was stressed
cuz I was like oh I've got to make sure
mine's in front of a window but then
he's gonna need that too but now that he
got me my diva ring light that kind of
eliminates that problem so it wouldn't
really matter if I'm facing a window
like I am now but yes I'm excited and
I'm excited about all my like my new 9
drawer I key a set that he got me is
such an awesome addition I'm very
excited I'm a little stressed - just
thinking of moving again and all that
stuff but thank you Beth where's your
honeymoon gonna be jadi 95s it's we know
for sure Paris we are probably gonna go
to Disneyland Paris because if you know
us we love Disney and so that's
something that we're like it would be
worth any amount of money - do we look -
illy we're not sure though with just all
kinds of things going on in the world
you're there there's stuff going on in
Paris - but where we think we might
avoid Italy for this trip but we're not
sure we I want to go to Switzerland or
Austria I want to go everywhere there
am I kidding so we'll see we will see um
okay
oh my gosh I love this question Bethke
just asked if you were traveling summer
that required a glamorous night out and
you could only pack five products what
would they be okay
my hourglass ambient lighting palette
you know what no because I just love
this and I wouldn't go anywhere with it
but if it were glamorous I wanted like
sparkle spark
I would pack some sort of not
necessarily this one but some sort of
loose like shimmery highlight this is a
star looks one that's all I know it
doesn't say anything else about it
but it's just a really shimmery
highlight and I don't wear it on an
everyday basis because I'm like it's too
much but for something like a glamorous
night out this would be one
what else would I pack lipstick oh I
would bring my YSL rouge developed in 29
it's this insanely gorgeous pink and I
just love it like these are so like I
only own two I probably won't own more
than this because they are so expensive
but for like a treat yourself kind of
thing I would wear this glamorous night
what else this is fun I think I would
wear this hard candy blush for my blush
because it's so unbelievably gorgeous
and shimmery but during the day it's
almost too much but at night it would be
beautiful it's a hard candy ombre baked
blush and punch and I just recently
hauled at my drugstore haul and it's
just this gorgeous kind of very shimmery
pink so really if I had this I guess I
wouldn't really need the highlight but
regardless what else this is hard to do
what else would I pack need to
reorganize my makeup collection oh I
would use my this is so boring but I
would my NARS radiant creamy concealer
cuz when I use it I feel again very
glamorous but it really does an amazing
job at brightening this is something
that when I first got it I didn't I
tried it for weeks and I was like what
is so great about it but I've realized
as I've used other products and then
gone back to this that this really is
amazing it stays on it doesn't budge so
that would be another I know I'm
answering this in the most boring way
you guys I know but I can't help it
what else would I bring what about I
shadow like what palette would I use for
a glam
oh there's so many ones that I love I
can't decide maybe you know what would
it be my chocolate bar palette I think I
would go and make it out let's be real
because I've been refiling in love with
this and I think I would go with the
naked 2 because I love this one out of
all of them and there's so many
unbelievable shimmery shades that just
make your eyes pop like crazy so I think
this would be probably like that's one I
love it so much I have already made a
mess
Amadeus okay that was a fun question if
you were asked to only take one kind of
hair product whether to be dry shampoo
period dry shampoo you guys I love the
batiste one and I had that brunette one
and I had said in a few videos that I
didn't like it because it did get a
little bit of brown like on my skin or
on my hands but you guys after using
that up and getting rid of it and then I
got a few other batiste ones that I like
I hate that I have to brush through it
because it's why I mean I brush dirt
regardless but I already missed the
brunette one and I can't believe I'm
saying this because I hated it but I
turns out I loved it because I didn't
have to worry about that weird gray
white cast so go figure I'm probably
gonna buy another one but this one
smells amazing this one is the tropical
but dry shampoo because my hair I'm like
I don't really have anything in it today
if you can't tell I didn't straightening
either my part is my I'm a mess I'm a
mess today regardless um I just I feel
like I can get away with not really
having much in it but if it's day two
hair dry shampoo all the way love it
okay
any tips to help conceal large pores
primers one of my favorite primers to
fill in pores is what silicon silicon
based primers I think work the best and
I love this Mirabella one it's called
Mirabella prime for face I got it in the
I'm sure boxycharm or something but it
is a clear silicone base but it just
fills it in and when I use this I
usually only use it on my nose and
actually I could stand to use it today
so my nose isn't looking great with that
BB cream another one that's pretty good
that if you I'm assuming this one's a
little pricier is the elf mineral face
primer again a silicone one that would
just kind of fill it in and just be a
good base for that that's I don't really
I mean I have pores that you can see but
they're not large I'm gonna say yet
because I have a feeling that's to come
but that's what I would recommend but I
haven't had a ton of experience with
that okay so next one first off I want
to say this is from Sabrina first up I
want to say I love watching you and
Tyler and can't wait to see your trip
for your honeymoon I keep meaning to get
to the store to buy German stuff to send
you guys we would love that we will
probably unbox it on his channel because
that was so much fun when our subscriber
Tracy sent us the Japanese stuff anyway
let me put this up here so it doesn't
get lost while you're in Europe do you
plan to shop for European makeup brands
yes and I would love to know I don't
really watch many European channels here
on YouTube so I'd be very curious to
hear if you're from Europe what you
would recommend because I know of
certain brands that are out there but I
don't know what within those brands are
worth buying and you know it's gonna
take up valuable carry-on space so keep
that in mind so like if you had one
product you would say you've got to get
this what would it be that would be very
helpful okay
hey Jess I want to say I love your
videos you always have a way to brighten
someone say Thank You Monica that was
really sweet okay teacher question what
are your favorite least part Sarver
favorite parts of being a teacher
favorite the kids I mean there are times
every single day that the kids will say
something that makes me laugh til I cry
like they are so hilarious and if you
really just like sit back and just take
a breath because you know you can get so
stressed out when they're not being
quiet or they're not doing you know this
that are you but if you just sit back
and take a breath and watch them they're
hilarious especially I teach 11 and 12
year old sixth graders they're so funny
and some of them make me laugh every
single day so that's one of my favorite
parts and of course I mean the classics
like seeing them learn something or get
something that's a big deal but I mostly
just enjoy being around them least
favorite parts are you know when kids
get in fights or it just it makes me sad
it makes me sad to my core because I
think what am I doing wrong like I'm I
feel like I'm building a classroom
community I feel like we're getting
along and then you know within a week
we'll have three fights like what is
going on so that is something that just
makes
me sat on top of that testing we just
got done with our first round of like
the statewide standardized testing in
our state and I think my kids did very
very well and I'm so proud of them but
it's stressful and stressful for them
for the parents for me and it's just
all-around not a fun week that's for
sure good question
hey Jess it's Melissa hey Melissa I know
you she said hope all's well I know
y'all are food junkies so what are your
top spices you like to use and one of
your favorite sweets and other foods
okay spices I think one of my favorites
is that's hard well garlic I don't
consider a spice but I just love garlic
probably cumin I just love there's
something about it that I can always
taste it in a food and I just like it
another one that I really like is
coriander and I didn't realize that
coriander were the seeds from the
cilantro plant like that that they're
derived from the same plant I had no
idea until the other day I'm like oh
that would explain why I like it cuz I
love cilantro and then favorite sweets
we like I don't know we like everything
I'm a big dark chocolate person and so
is he and so anything that's more of a
rich taste in that way like a deeper
taste rather than like birthday cake you
know what I mean but I don't know I love
sweets I love rice krispie treats too
okay I don't know how these questions do
your kids know that you have a YouTube
channel my students yes a lot of them
watch it they might be watching this for
all I know um which is this Gary about
no I'm kidding they watch them all the
time and you know some a lot of the
parents know that I have a channel and
some of them have seen my videos too and
it's not I don't do anything
risque on my channel I don't thank her
you know so it's not that big of a deal
I don't usually anyway all right next
question have you ever dealt with
anxiety or depression
that's Kathleen um maybe anxiety I have
never been depressed and that I'm
blessed with and I think when I was
younger I might say oh I'm depressed but
you never mean it in the way that some
people truly do suffer from it and so
you know as an adult I can see the
difference I can see that that's not
what I've ever
from but I have you know you get in
those times during certain years like
especially in the winter when not only
and I know they talk about the you know
seasonal anxiety disorder and that very
low might be a thing I have no idea but
I do feel like you know there have been
times not necessarily this year really
it was before I had a YouTube channel to
be honest and before I would have my
teaching job and when everything just
felt so up in the air that I would get
very like kind of panicky and then I
would start thinking about my loved ones
dying or me dying and I would I would
panic a little bit but I don't know if
it's something I just grew out of and
maybe that's something you just go
through naturally but I haven't really
dealt with it anymore um so and I really
can't speak to that very much because I
don't I feel like people that have gone
through more than I have could speak to
that more that's what I'll say okay
trying to get rid of I don't know how to
get like getting rid of questions that
I've already answered so how long have
you been doing YouTube and why did you
start I've been doing it almost two
years I think my two-year anniversary is
coming up like April 7th or something
like that
and it hasn't been until recently that
there's been a ton of growth I mean it's
been growing steadily and I've been so
so blessed but it's been very recently
that it's been growing a lot since I've
been kind of shifting my channel towards
more reviews and more demos and since
I've realized that that's what I've been
missing that's when the growth has
started I'm very happy that I realized
that and I've been working a lot harder
too why did I start because I watched a
lot of people on here that I thought you
know what like everything just feels so
fake and I don't know who I can trust
and that's why it's a big deal to me
when someone says oh you're you're just
saying that because they sent you that
for free I'm like no because I get no
benefit from them yeah they've already
sent it to me for free if I said I hated
it that's not gonna change the fact that
I already own it it's like they're gonna
take it back so what if they don't send
me stuff in the future that's their loss
because you know you know what I'm
saying
I will always be honest with you guys
and that's why it really gets to my core
when people say oh she's not being
honest she's being sponsored her she I'm
like that is my game
like that is why I started the YouTube
channel because everyone was being fake
so that's never gonna change and if it
ever did I would just shut down my
youtube channel just forget it
sponsorship the sponsorships are there
nothing wrong with them as long as you
genuinely are being honest about the
product you know I'm not gonna accept a
sponsorship with something that I
haven't already tried that I already
know I like or that's one no really
that's it
I'm just not going to unless I tried the
thing and then I'll say okay I do like
it yes you can sponsor me because then
there's no shame in saying yes I love
this product and they're paying me to
say it but well really not even they're
paying me to talk about it but I
genuinely love it there's nothing wrong
with that I see nothing wrong with that
okay well I just got on a pedestal sorry
you guys I get paid I get worked up um
okay what fave makeup products hi in a
drugstore high end like if I just had to
pick one I can't
I really do you guys I love this and I
know I talk about all the time but I
really do love it it's so just gorgeous
and if you're gonna splurge on something
it's so just amazing but like I've said
a thousand times you can get a very
similar look to the wet and wild reserve
your Cabana one and I know some people
disagree but I mean it looks the same on
my skin to turn on my skin type so
that's why I say that I believe it's a
do and then drugstore one of my
favorites right now oh this is just one
of my favorites right now the NYC loose
powder and translucent it's so gorgeous
it's um it's just gorgeous guys my
battery's about to die hold on wait is
it I don't know how long have we been
doing this you guys okay um so yeah I
just love it I've been doing it on my
t-zone and yeah it's just lovely okay um
do you entire their plan to have kids
anytime soon oh um good question we've
talked about this a lot we we're pretty
sure we want to have kids but um I don't
think within the first year because you
know we want to we're just now gonna be
living together and there's so much we
want to get we need to get used to each
other and living to each other even
though we've been dating for like five
years but still so we want to wait a
little bit but I think we're pretty sure
we'll they'll eventually have kids yes
um okay Ilana I love your youtube I
literally live to watch
you inspired me to do makeup the only
person i religiously watch thank you I
just have so many problems with brushes
for my crease oh my gosh okay my
favorites I have two favorites and I use
them every day
and then I rewash them and use them
again the Sigma e-40 I don't know many
Sigma brushes and this is the only Sigma
brush that I use religiously and I was
well I guess I technically still am a
Sigma affiliate but I don't I haven't
really talked about them much really
ever only when I feel the need so this
one I love it's unbelievable and it's so
good at just this I literally use this
today to get like a light color and just
go all over for like a wash above for
color and then this elf one oh my gosh
I want like ten of these this is the elf
crease brush and it's smaller than that
other one and it's amazing at getting
right in the crease and it's really
really soft oh my gosh and it's like $3
I literally need to buy like four of
these so I don't have to keep washing it
it is unbelievable so I hope that helped
umm okay I'm trying to think what's the
number one thing you're looking forward
to after your wedding and honeymoon
that's from Amara probably just like
getting back to where we're gonna be
living together and just like settling
in and watching you know Game of Thrones
or house of cards or whatever watching
at the time or Downton Abbey and and
then not having to say goodbye at the
end of the night I know I mention that
earlier but I think that's what I'm
looking forward to that's umm way
lighter than mine okay this is from
Kelly she said just wondering if you
could recommend a BB cream or CC cream
for someone with really pale skin
lighter than mine the lightest BB cream
I have tried so far is the NYC one and
what I like about it is it does provide
a little bit of coverage but it's not it
doesn't turn orange it's the only BB
cream I really tried that does them and
this one's an 0-1 light I really like it
that but keep in mind I've only tried
like five or six BB creams so I'm sure
there are other ones out there and if
anyone else has suggested for her but
that's the one I'm wondering hold on I'm
in the questions but I'm wondering if I
go to chat oh I'm the only one in there
never mind let me go back to questions
okay wait where'd they go
Oh No okay
um what's your favorite lights and
medium coverage foundation for summer
Hong Kong this is Shirley let me see um
lie to me yeah I would say ooh telephone
light to medium coverage honestly
probably the Rimmel lasting finish one
and I really do I know I can keep saying
I need to do a review but I do this one
is amazing it makes your skin look like
satin but it stays that way all day it
doesn't get crazy greasy I mean you
probably wouldn't need to set it but
that's no big deal to me but I haven't
been in one-on-one classic ivory but
it's it's so good and it's got I would
say medium coverage right off the bat so
you could build it up to full but I know
you wanted light to meet him I love this
stuff if you need like a way more
mattifying one than I would say the
infallible Pro matte because I think
with one coat of this it is more just
medium you could make it full by doing
two but it really doesn't matter fight
really well so I love that too yay Jesse
oh I know you that sounded weird I she
comments on all my videos she's been a
subscriber for a very long time she said
she bought the NYC BB cream in love's
I'm so glad you do yeah I liked using
it's a - even though you can see like I
don't know I'm looking cray have you
tried the lorac pro front of the line
liner no oh I lost your question where
did it go no I have not um where did
that question go guys I don't know how
to do this you know I'm clueless hmm
anyway no I have it I'm now I'm
interested because I haven't even heard
of it so I love your channel so much
would you ever do a DIY series on your
channel I don't really do anything
myself I don't do any do yourselves up I
probably do maybe it I just don't
realize I do maybe but that would have
to be something that I actually feel
passionate about before I do it because
sometimes I'll watch people's DIYs and
I'm like this is a stretch slang like
it's either it just seems awkward or
like they're just forcibly doing it or
it's just something that's so obvious
how to do it yourself and I'm like why
is this a thing so I would have to feel
really strongly about something that I
wanted to do a DIY on before I would do
that so hopefully that answered your
question okay
oh now I'm seeing people play
them and they move up oh do you have a
planner yes I have an ear in contraband
let me grab Oh far away okay
actually I'll show you both so I have
got hey I got my Erin Condren one for
2015 which I love but and I gotta be
honest I have not been filling it out
lately because I've been using my Erin
Condren wedding one I've done a video on
both of these on my channel but the
wedding one I did a video on and that's
it goes through and there's like
checklists for your wedding just all
kinds of things it's pretty incredible
what it has I oh my gosh I love it and
it even goes through like you know who
your bridesmaids are you can list I
haven't done the groomsmen but and
there's all these um checklist for okay
six to four months before your wedding
what should you do four to two months
just it's awesome so yes I love Erin
Condren so much I actually ordered my
save the dates and my invitations from
their site so yeah Oh awesome so she
said that the lorac eyeliner is really
good I might have to look into that
thank you um okay um loved watching the
review of mary kay products
she's a sales director with them this is
Mandy Swank have you received any other
direct sale makeup brands like Arbonne
Alouette and I've never even heard of
Alouette um I mean I would not mind
reviewing anything any of them I I had
owned a lot of Avon in the past but I
don't own any I don't think I own any
more Avon anymore I really like Avon
products too or at least I did when I
had them but other than that I mean I
would I just haven't and you know the
reality is just for everyone's to know
you know you do get contacted by a lot
of companies and it is so amazing but at
the same time I have to say no a lot and
I would say I say no to companies
sending me things probably 70% of the
time 75% because it would be too much
and I know that that sounds terrible I
don't mean it that way I'm just being
honest with you guys after a certain
point I'm like I can't possibly review
that many products have room for all
that stuff and so I try and funnel and
say okay what do I
you guys would be interested in that I
am interested in that I think would be
beneficial for you guys to see reviewed
that you guys would have an interest in
and so that's kind of how I decide like
okay yes you can send it to me maybe
I'll review it we'll see that type of
thing I hope that came out right I
didn't mean that that might have came
out wrong I didn't mean it now
show my pugs one of them is really I
might go get Simha
maybe he's crazy though and he just runs
away but Boston my older one is so old
like he he's so old he's gonna die soon
I'm so company so sad um okay um
trying to see Oh Jamie is getting
married the day before me what makeup
will I be wearing okay I've only decided
on a few things one thing I know that
I'm gonna be wearing is my Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation because it
doesn't have SPF so it won't like
flashback weird and it makes my skin
look perfect and this 150 buff is almost
like gray toned in a way I know it looks
completely different than my skin tone
but it is perfect for my skin tone and
it it just doesn't move it is so
beautiful I did a review on this a long
time ago my channel and recently like
today I think someone commented and said
hey do you still like this I was like
actually yes I still love it even though
that was like a year to have ago so that
one I know I'm gonna wear beyond that
what else did I decide on I don't know I
think I think I'm gonna wear Mac full of
joy on my cheeks it's like a really
pretty it's just such a pretty almost
lilac e color but it's I just love it so
much and I think for like a highlight
I'm gonna wear my hourglass one but
beyond that I think for concealer I am
gonna wear my NARS one for lipstick I
don't know yet it actually might be that
YSL when I showed you guys earlier
number 29 just because it really does
stay put I also recently got a NARS
lipstick I don't know where it is it
might be in my car actually NARS Anita
not and I know everyone talks about that
but I got Anita which is a really pretty
color that I'm thinking about I really
like the formula of those I wish it
weren't so expensive I just bought it
and I'm like why did I buy this but then
I tried it I'm like oh yeah because
these are unbelievable so I don't know
those are the only things I've really
kind of decided about so far favorite
Mac lip
sticks um got my little here syrup is
one of my favorites I did a giveaway
with some of these earlier of my channel
it's just such a pretty just simple
color it's kind of sheer ish but I just
love it
another favorite is where is oh my gosh
all fired up is like a matte blue toned
red I've been looking for one like this
forever
it is unbelievable it is the perfect red
and then this is my other favorite angel
yeah which I have angel and cream cup
and they're similar but angels a little
deeper and I just love it oh my gosh
so those I would say those are the three
I would recommend higher than anything
else someone said what 10 MAC lipsticks
I see that that kid Karen I don't even
own 10 I haven't even tried 10 so wow
those are the calm down phones um phone
so I don't have more than one okay you
should do a video on my way to make up I
probably will at least on that I don't
know maybe I'll do like a get ready with
me wait wedding day but it wouldn't be
on my wedding day I'd be like maybe a
week before when I'm trying it out maybe
anyway okay umm me answered that Thank
You Chelsea said I made it too alive
yeah I know I feel the same way love
your videos I always click on your
videos and I see a new one thank you
don't you guys I have people like that
too that I watch here on YouTube that I
feel are like they're like ride-or-die
youtubers like i every time they post a
video no matter what it is i watch it
even if it's something that i could care
less about like a celery beauty hack you
know and that was made no sense because
or what i mean i watch it anyway because
i love them who are some my ride-or-die
ones I would say I love Jen loves
reviews I love it's Kirsten she cracks
me up
um I'm forgetting people that I love I
know I typically watched Andrea
mati on OHS videos I just recently got
back into coffee break with Danny's
videos I had unsubscribe for a while
and I don't really even remember why but
I research scribe began and I was like I
do love her I don't I don't know it's
kind of I'm forgetting some that I love
but I did oh I love a love tart she's
got a very calming voice I do love tot
ce from glam life guru
although she does so much high-end that
like she used to do so much more
drugstore and I know that kind of
happens and I know like I'm getting more
into high-end but I will never go fully
iron because it is way too much money
and I love the drugstore
anyway what grade do I teach sixth grade
okay let's see sorry I'm trying to you
guys know I don't know how to figure
this any tips for college students on my
gosh college hmm she said I feel like
it's dragging on on and on that's Amelia
Amelia I I was in college for seven
years and I don't know that I've ever
said that on my channel seven years and
the first well really was six and a half
first two and a half we're at in Chicago
for musical theater and that was a
totally different life experience and
then the last four were for my teaching
degree here in Indiana Indianapolis and
it felt like I dragged on and on to but
just stay organized and just keep in
mind why you're there I think so many
people go to college just because I go
it's the next step to college but then
they forget why they're there I'm like
why are you there like you're spending a
ton of money go to class take notes
pass your test you're paying this money
even if it's free you're getting this
for free for a reason you're supposed to
do something with it and you know I
watch a lot of people that I went to
school with that I'm like they didn't
pay attention in class and they didn't
do their homework and they didn't read
the articles or the textbook like why
are you wasting your time then you're
just wasting time like soak up all you
can I wish I could sit in a class right
now and learn French I'm trying to learn
French with the podcast which it's
actually going okay but I wish I could
just sit in a class that I paid for and
learn it and soak up everything I can so
while you're there just soak up all of
it that's what I would recommend also
stay out of the drama as much as you can
I know it's hard okay um
have you tried adagio teas yes and when
I was last in Chicago at Christmastime
with Tyler and my parents and I got to
see my friend Sarah and I went to an
Adagio tea store and it was so much fun
I get to try a whole bunch of different
ones but I love they have like a
Christmas blend that I really really
liked and it was like a I think it was a
black tea and I'm not big on black tea
but I loved it and but I love the
it's all I think all of them are loose
teas and I love the way it's just simply
packaged almost like a natural food
store so I had a lot of fun in the store
but I've gotten adagio teas in my cozy
mug subscription and it is so good so
yeah I like it
hey guys how long have we been doing
this seriously I'm trying to figure out
how to even see I'm really hungry and
also my battery's about to die I'm gonna
trough the camera for a second I'm gonna
go get my charger and I'll be right back
you
look suppose like what simple what are
you doing did you go play outside I took
you for a walk now is food guys you want
to know what snack I'm snacking on he's
freaking out right now sweet potato
chips from all these these literally I
mean there's like nine grams of fat so
it's not like it's super healthy but the
ingredients list sweet potatoes canola
oil sea salt that's it
plus it's got 90 percent of here by
Dominion vitamin D no vitamin A for the
like sent daily value I'm like what so
I'm not speaking up not just but I'm
starving you guys Simba is to some of
you can't eat these I don't think Irish
got Chrome is everywhere has anyone ever

hello from the Bronx okay please please
show Simba she's pug obsessed well good

hey hi oh my gosh she's so cute
sometimes I died hmm
okay let's see there's no escape so I'm
gonna just let it go no escape alright

I keep forgetting you guys have no idea
what I'm reading it says Abby says well
I'm a college student I go to school in
Indiana alright fine is Kate shoot this
don't eat the chips I really want to
teach upper elementary in Indianapolis
weird that is awesome you will love it
oh that's a good question
I'm newish to the video making aspect of
YouTube and I'm wondering what your
process was to grow your channel
organically it's from tour well I did do
a video kind of about it called my
YouTube tips and tricks I think but
honestly just I don't want to use the
word Network because you're not really
networking but find people that are like
you and start talking to them send them
a message on YouTube or on Instagram and
say you know and it's different than
like spamming and I don't think no I
know that I never spam and people kill
me when they spam and they say hey you
know great video loved it
come check out my channel and then they
copy and paste it onto five of my videos
like within the same five minutes like
so you know if you're going to do that
at least make it like watch the video
and like respond to that video and make
it at least a little more friendly I
don't even know so uh I've done that
like ten times sorry um my sister is in
Disney like right now where would you
recommend she go oh I'm so jealous okay
Disney World or Disneyland there's a big
difference um if she I miss I'm gonna
assume Disney World because to me I love
I love them all um go to Epcot and go to
the Mexico pavilion and go inside and if
she longs to meet she's not of age
doesn't say get a margarita at the cava
Delta Keela but just go in there and
ride the little ride with Donald Duck
because it's the best and I just love
the environment inside the Mexico
pavilion okay what else does she do she
should ride Soren if she hasn't because
it is so amazing it's worth the wait in
the line if she can't get a fast pass um
what else oh my I'm like I feel like I'm
I can't answer a quick enough um I don't
know those are things why am I only
talking about f-con Magic Kingdom go
just sit in from the castle and stare at
it for like
years and eat a Mickey ice cream thing I
can't guys I can't think on my feet
about Disney I need to take a breath and
think about it for a second
okay um oh that was Jesse again so Alice
or at least I don't know she said I
found the hard candy palate yeah it's a
miracle wearing it today I love it too
I was gonna pick up the new foundation
but it looked a little orange I'm the
pale so pale I tried it and I filmed a
review of it and it will be up well I
might adit it after I'm done with this
anyway it's it's not my favorite it's
good it is good but it's not my favorite
so I would say I would say get another
one that's what I would say it's okay um
Oh Kailyn said my friend and I are
getting ready to watch Disney movies and
make homemade pizza what Disney movies
should be in our lineup I'm at a
sleeping beauty mood because I just saw
Maleficent finally for the first time so
I want to watch Sleeping Beauty today
and I just got it I'm part of the Disney
movie clubs of course I am Tiger has his
own account too just so we can get all
the Disney movies we can but I always
get like the five free blu-rays or five
blue rates for like a dollar and then
you have to like fulfill your purchase
tremendous you still have to buy like
four within two years but then you can
cancel it and rejoin I've done it like
five times so like everyone does that so
you cancel it and then you rejoin a
little bit later and you can get your
five DVDs for for a dollar and then you
know you just do a cycle my sister
doesn't do anyway what was the point of
that I don't know I would watch the
mutti maybe tangled princess in the frog
is one of my ultimate favorites oh my
gosh I love princess the problem maybe
I'll watch that today I need to do
laundry okay mm-hmm
this is so crazy this is so cool I see
my friend oh I already read that hi hi
um Cree Brie she asked if I would ever
consider going cruelty-free that's hard
because obviously I love the animals
and it's something that I think people
struggle with because they know there
are so many makeup products that are
really good that aren't cruelty free
brands so I don't know it's something
that I think I'm kind of slowly moving
towards but I don't know if I'll ever be
a hundred percent I certainly might try
it's hard and especially when you have a
YouTube channel where you want to be
able to review things that people are
curious about that aren't troll to be
free necessarily so it's hard but it is
something that I've thought about a lot
that I'm gonna continue thinking about
and praying about thank you Ilana said
or Elaine I'm not sure I swear you're
the only youtuber that doesn't neglect
the cheaper products everyone else on
YouTube mostly does Mac and high-end
products yeah well I'm glad you
appreciate it and that's I appreciate
that and other youtubers too and if you
I don't know if my subscriptions are
public but you saw who I was subscribed
to most of them are people that mostly
focus on drugstore because that's what I
care about - that's normal that's
everyday and I never want to have my
channel focused on people like the upper
fifth of know like the upper 20th of
people that can actually afford to buy
all those high-end products and the
reality is I can't afford to buy all
those high-end products and even if I
could that's not the point of why my
channels here so I'm glad that you've
noticed that and thank you um let's see
Zumba you stinky it was like rainy out
this morning and now it's kind of nicer
he smells like a rainy doggy hmm what's
Boston new then he's sleeping
what's Boston doing you want go outside
huh maybe see we use go for another walk
he's gonna run away he put my hair up
well stinky yes um okay let's think oh I
wish Oliver said what do you think about
Obama's plan to have the cost of at
least the first two years of Community
College down to zero well that would be
amazing
I would owe a lot less money in student
loans I own so much money in student
loans it's unbelievable it is
unbelievable and I haven't heard really
about that to be honest but if that were
true Simba stop it that would be amazing
oh my gosh hmm what's my favorite
high-end brand it's a pet some people
consider high-end like only like crazy
high-end like Dior and why I sell hold
on I let them out but I would consider
high-end to be like anything that's not
sold at the drugstore so like I would
consider benefit high-end because it's
expensive but some people even if you've
never heard this
some people don't consider that high-end
they would consider that mid-range and
they would consider like YSL and Dior
and all those things that cost you know
like $60 and $70 and $80 pal high-end
now those are certainly high-end but I
would consider benefit in all them to a
favorite brand might be to face I love
the shadows I love their la creme
lipsticks have I tried any of their like
blushes I don't know I need to branch
out a little more with that but I just
love those things and I was realizing
today I'm like I really do love Too
Faced so that might be one of my
favorites okay do you know any six years
that watch your video yes some of my
students do oh that's a cool thought
Kathryn said Jessica personality's
wonderful thank you you're genuine and
true don't ever change
PS you should try to do more videos
about your faith that'd be really cool
for your Christian subscribers god bless
I've thought about that and I don't know
I mean I know I mentioned a lot and I
know that a lot of you guys aren't
Christian and that there's nothing wrong
with that it's just we all believe
different things and part of what I
believe I mean pretty much the basis of
what I believe is that if you're a good
person you will go to heaven I mean I
don't think that you have to be an earth
shaker I think it'd be amazing we need
or shakers that are amazing people but I
don't think you have to do the most
ridiculous things to be able to get into
heaven like some people believe I really
believe that just being a good person
and so rare and I work towards that I'm
not perfect by any means
we have so much to work on I'm so
impatient I can get jealous easily I
mean I there's so many things that I am
working on and I probably my whole life
will work on but I think as long as
we're all kind of trying to continue
down that path we're all gonna be
alright we're all gonna be alright okay
um what's next I think I might answer
one more and then I've got to go
I'm like seriously hungry and I need to
wash my sheets what's my favorite
palette at the moment honestly you guys
I can't stop using okay I'm gonna show
you to I can't stopped using this hard
candy palette that is a dupe for my
two-faced one that I love because it's
just so first of all they're really
close if you haven't seen my video you
should watch it but this the palette
that I just love it like I'm using this
over my Too Faced one it's so cool and
it's eight bucks at Walmart but another
thing I can't stop using that will
probably be in my March favorites is
this Pixy quad in shades of taupe and
it's got these four shades and they're
unbelievable I got it on HauteLook a
while ago and it's on there all the time
but you can also I think just buy it
online straight up but I love this so
much oh my gosh so that's it so I know
there are more questions but I got in it
at some point because I really am
starving
I got things to do but I am gonna try
and edit some of those videos I
mentioned here and upload them this
weekend but I hope it was fun for you
guys this is fun for me I'll have to do
this more often especially when I'm just
craving that time to chat with you guys
it feels so much more real when I'm live
talking with you guys and I know there
were so many questions I didn't get to
answer hold on to them the next time I
do it maybe it'll be next weekend I
don't know maybe it'll be randomly on a
weeknight I don't know but I think it's
kind of fun to just pop it up
sporadically just see these they're so
much fun I love you guys so much I know
a lot of you guys have told me that I'm
really close to 100,000 subscribers
I am so flabbergasted because it is so
just it's just otherworldly it's very
surreal and it is so amazing to think
that that many 90,000 of you could give
a crap about what I have
say about makeup I'm not a makeup artist
I just love it and it means so much to
me that you guys would trust me and that
you watched me time after time I mean it
is such an amazing feeling and please
know that I will always always notice
you guys so hopefully this is fun I
think I know how to hang up pretty young
I'm on the phone with you guys all right
love you bye okay so anyway I hope you
guys learned something or at least we're
entertained for a little bit of time
here with me I have a certainly
entertain chat with you guys and I'll
catch you guys later bye yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
