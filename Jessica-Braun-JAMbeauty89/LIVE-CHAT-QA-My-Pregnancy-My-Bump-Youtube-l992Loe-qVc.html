actually started I mean it says it is
but I'm also like uploading a video on
my computer over there and I'm like this
is probably horrible timing to decide to
go ahead and broadcast something live
with your Wi-Fi at the same time that
you're also you know uploading video it
takes a lot of bandwidth so let me go
into my comments on the actual on my
actual like YouTube page cuz if you
didn't know like this is a Google
hangout so there's like group chat but
it doesn't actually like show up so oh I
see you also there's the live chat on
YouTube oh my gosh you guys are so
lovely can I just say and now it's gonna
make optional okay
I'm Jesse come on hold it together so
can I just say that you guys literally
made my day just now just seeing all of
you guys saying hi hi hi hi because it
makes me think back to the like when I
use it when I first was starting my
channel I remember my first live chat I
ever did I don't even know if it's like
still on YouTube or not I don't even
remember what it was but I remember
being like there were like 10 people in
the chat and I was like oh my gosh I'm
so exciting to me because I thought that
no one would watch it and so even today
like still when all start a live chat
I'll think no I spent like no one's
gonna be there and you guys are always
there and it's so so cool it's so cool
now you don't think I'll ever get over
that um
don't mind this little curly baby
so okay where is my brain today I want
you guys to ask me questions I'm gonna
answer questions about all kinds of
stuff I promise but I had this kind of
realization today and it bothered me and
it bothered me so much like last night I
couldn't sleep well today well I was at
work I kept thinking about it and it was
bothering me I feel like I've been
trying to put a lot of effort into my
videos lately but because I work full
time as many of us do and I'm trying to
do YouTube I'm still finding that
balance it's taking me years but
especially now with also just you know
being pregnant and tired and in a bad
mood alot trying to figure this all out
and so what I've been doing
filming on the weekends usually I'll
literally sit down on the Saturday or
Sunday film a ton and then that's it for
the next week and then the next weekend
and so it takes up a lot of a weekend
which is fine but I'm trying to find
ways to like I've got to do it
throughout the week you know what I'm
saying and so for that reason I'm trying
to find a way to make it so that I don't
feel like exhausted while I'm filming
all of these you know five videos in a
row so for example the video about
bleeding right now as an elf best and
worst
I've actually filmed it a couple weeks
ago I just forgot about no one I haven't
put that up yet so that's gonna be live
probably during this live chat it'll
probably go live wait watch it later
it'll still be there anyway so what I
realized as I was editing it the editing
that is I was like like I was just like
not in a bad mood but like if you watch
it you're gonna see like I feel like I'm
smiling less and like I don't know and I
think it's because I'm filming five
videos in a row and I'm just tired and
so I guess what I'm trying to say while
it took way too long to say I'm trying
to say is I want to find ways to spread
this out because I do enjoy and love
filming videos but I don't want it to
come through that I'm like in a bad mood
or like you know I used to do a lot of
like try ons while I was explaining why
I like the product and I haven't done
that in a while because it's hard to do
when I know that that day I'm gonna be
filming so much so I'm wanting to just
find a way to so that's kind of my
thought process I hear you guys a lot of
you guys have been like you know I miss
oh sorry oh that's my mommy I've heard a
lot of your guys's comments saying you
know I miss you got your try ons and you
know when you would kind of show us how
you're putting it on that kind of stuff
I hear you and I promise I'm gonna get
back to doing that as much as I can
I miss it too and I think it it
definitely amps up my videos and it
definitely makes my videos more helpful
okay my shut up so what you guys want to
know I know you guys are so sweet
I see laura-leigh said you're trying to
do too much not laura-leigh like themes
were I know and I know I'm allowed to be
in a bad mood
they said you're allowed to be in a bad
mood you're making a person so true um
okay I know I know I know you guys are
so so sweet so okay I'm due late May I'm
like I don't like to say the date I feel
like it like jinx is the due date I know
it doesn't but that's just me but it is
late May so right now I'm 23 weeks along
um baby names we're not sharing we saw
please we can't figure out what we would
call this little girl but it is a girl a
lot of you guys didn't know that I
announced it on Instagram but I never
made like a youtube video about it so I
guess this is me on YouTube telling you
it is a girl that part is not a secret
um but but yeah so anyway so we're
figuring out the name but that we're
gonna wait and once we actually have the
girl we will share the name um but we
definitely looked at a lot of Disney
names I don't know if she'll end up with
one or not but there are definitely some
Disney names on our list um but we'll
see
it is exciting it's so fun and we've
recently gotten the nursery like
together there's not stuff on the walls
yet but like we've got a lot of the
furniture already like a crib actually
my sister had one so she gave us the
crib some stuff we already had so we
started our registry the other day at
byebye baby and I'm like it's so
overwhelming and I know there I've read
so many blogs about like there's so much
you don't need and I'm thankful to have
lots of family and friends that have
recently had kids or in the midst of
having kids and they can also tell me
like you really don't need that or you
do need that so it's gonna be kind of a
learning curve I know for me in more
ways than one
anyway Oh someone said what was your
favorite hairspray it's the bedhead
masterpiece I got it on Ulta like two
nights ago or was it last night maybe
two nights ago because it was $10
instead of $23 isn't that ridiculous oh
my gosh oh my gosh anyway um alright so
oh my gosh I'm trying to like I need
someone to moderate this I know some
people do I don't know how to do it
though I'm I feel like I know a decent
amount of edge technology but my
knowledge is quite limited also can I
just tell you hold on
reaching it do you remember this candle
from Target sweet spun sugar from like a
couple years ago on YouTube ever miss
like I love it
suppose the cotton candy well it does
and it's amazing and if you're a Disney
nerd if you go in the shop and Disney
World Magic Kingdom the one backed by
Dumbo it's called Big Top souvenirs this
is the smell of that gift shop that's my
favorite anyway it really does smell
like really sweet cotton candy and I
love it and I bought it recently and
I've been burning it to shreds
that's not even normal for that but I
love it so much I wish it would burn
more evenly I trim the wicks all the
time but I figure once it gets down I'm
just gonna put it on a candle warmer but
I like that these are soy I really I
think I'm gonna start getting I haven't
bought a ton of bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks candles
lately I do really like them but I'm
kind of getting more into like these
more soy based you know anyway if you've
never smelled this at Target go smell it
you're gonna be like oh or you'll be
like you I hate it I don't know it'll be
what what is it one of the one or the
other you keep forgetting I'm live
alright Jessica don't pick your nose
don't pick your nose don't pick your
nose
alright so how has being pregnant been
it has actually been really awesome
we have scares at the beginning I've
kind of touched on that a bit when we
made our announcement here on YouTube
frankly the hardest things other than
like the scare and again I think I'll do
like a true dedicated video where I
really get into all of that because I
know there are other people that have
what I have based on what I've read
online like a lot of people but I want
to do that right and I want to do more
research and make sure I know what I'm
talking about but all of that is in the
past and everything is okay and our
little baby is healthy and I've gained
lots of weight and I mean not too much
but I definitely gained weight you know
and but like I feel like it's healthy
like I feel good did the hardest part
has been drinking less caffeine so like
I'm drinking some decaf sometimes I
drink half CAF but I've cut it down to
just one cup of coffee in the morning
and I heard a lot of people say oh I
wasn't a lot of drink any caffeine like
my doctor said two cups and you're good
two cups of regular shake you know
that's fine and even that I was like who
I'm used to like three but I've cut it
back to one and then in the evenings if
I really feel like I need it I'll do
like a half CAF or decaf whatever I just
like the feel of drinking coffee that's
my addiction truly it's just the feel of
drinking coffee you guys know what I
mean how do I pronounce my last name
bran just bran a lot of people think
it's brown or you know but it's just
bran BRE UN nursery tour I will do once
we get closer I mean there's still
there's so much we need to do so I might
show you bits and pieces on snapchat
from time to time but I'll do a true art
we'll make it closer again once we just
have more stuff there's not really
anything to show they wouldn't be very
fun oh yeah a lot of you guys are
talking about how your doctor allowed
you to drink am I gonna keep filming
after the baby's born
absolutely one thing I'm toying with is
taking some time off next year I mean I
can definitely as a teacher you could
take off a certain amount of time we're
just kind of deciding how much time to
take off because I want to all have the
summer but I really these are those kind
of moments I have the luxury of having a
youtube channel as a job as well and
because of that I've thought a lot about
it prayed a lot about it and thought you
know these are moments I'm never going
to be able to get back when this baby
and what if this is the only baby I have
you know I don't want to take that for
granted either that you know oh all have
more kids well what if I don't you know
anything can happen
and so with all of that in my mind I
really want to take advantage of this
time when the baby is super young and
it's my very first and so I'm definitely
wanting to stay home I'm just deciding
how long you know what I mean but with
me staying home I'll definitely be
filming still I mean I'm gonna run into
the same kind of problems I have now
with the full-time job a baby will be a
full-time job so figuring out when to
film and I'm lucky too because Tyler
works from home so we'll be able to kind
of tag team a lot and say you know he's
got to work too so Tyler you've got you
know if you're working from the hours of
9 to 12 I'll make sure I'm taking care
of the baby as much as possible and then
maybe I'm 12 to 4 that way we're still
getting work time in but we're kind of
you know we're gonna see I'm saying all
this now it's all gonna fall apart and
you know the best laid plans always fall
apart especially with the baby or kid um
and I was so blessed because my mom was
a stay-at-home mom growing up Tyler's
mom stayed at home and then both of them
you know as we all got older and started
going to school they started working I
don't know that I would ever be able I
don't know we'll just see um I will say
this though being pregnant I have never
got more advice in my life and maybe
it's not even just advice that part
doesn't bother me getting advice is
great but it's hilarious how many people
will say oh well you shouldn't be doing
that like okay thanks well my doctor
said I can sew but it doesn't matter you
know people have their own opinions and
you can't you can't shake that opinion
from the period because so many people
have had kids you've gone through what I
think you're currently some of you are
going through it right now and it's
hilarious because I'll say oh well I'm
gonna get a warm bath so many people
were like you're not allowed to get a
warm bath though I'm like well my doctor
literally told me to get a warm bath you
know what I mean so it's like it doesn't
matter so for me the Internet is
overwhelming they're so freaking much
online that tells you yes you should do
this no you can't do this Bulova and
they're all conflicting so for me I go
with what my doctor tells me period I
trust my doctor she's been doing this
long time and she's freaking amazing
um anyway so long story short I'm
trusting her opinion and it's just so
funny there's just so many scientific
studies and my family I never talking
about this the other day how you can
find a scientific study for anything you
can prove anything I mean both sides of
everything so it's you just have to kind
of take a lot with a grain of salt
and my biggest solace in all of this
overwhelming you know pieces of advice
is that people have been having babies
for thousands of years
and you know they haven't had the
technology we have today and the
knowledge we have about what might harm
the baby what might not what you should
what you shouldn't do and people have
survived so that's my biggest solace in
I'm gonna be alright like it's it's not
that deep you'll be fine the baby's
doing well you know any yes unsolicited
I see velvet it's just that unsolicited
advice absolutely unsolicited yeah
so who's I gonna say oh I know Fleur de
force on YouTube just had a baby and I
haven't watched her video but I've been
watching her like updates because I'm
like you know I can just go back and see
like okay I'm at 23 weeks did she posts
a video about that you know what I mean
um anyway so how will I handle Pinocchio
with a baby
um he's so sweet
I will say he's like laying on my tummy
all the time and it's not on it but like
near it and it's so sweet I think he
senses there's something different and I
read a lot of you guys when I posted
about that like a picture of him doing
that I think on Instagram a lot of you
guys were like yeah like my dog does the
same thing and he would just follow me
around more than normal and I thought
that was so sweet and so I have noticed
he fells like he Tyler is his favorite
that is his numero uno best favorite
person in the world I'm number two I've
accepted it but he's following me around
a lot more than normal which is kind of
cute and so I do think he kind of senses
but um how we're gonna handle it I mean
it's gonna be interesting we're gonna
try to do that thing where like you get
you know may have something that the
baby wore at the hospital have someone
bring it to our house and the Pinocchio
kind of sniff it you'll roll around in
it just to kind of get that smell get
that out of his system so he's kind of
used to it so when we do bring the baby
home you know he's so gentle with dogs
you can never predict though you know
but he's so good with all my so many
nieces and nephews and there's so many
babies in our lives that he's been
around and he really is gentle so that's
good but well you know we'll just see
he's so sweet
oh my gosh um anyway are we doing a
Disney themed Nursery it's not no we're
gonna definitely have some Disney
splashes in there please and so oh my
gosh so many of you guys have sent me
these sweet
things to our peel box like one of you
guys made a sweet homemade little beagle
named jiminy like you know Pinocchio
Jiminy Cricket and so right now it's
sitting on the little dresser in there
and it is so sweet and those kinds of
things we just love some of you guys
have sent really cute outfits like oh my
gosh I love it so we what every time we
open some for like so we just like hang
it in the little nursery we need to wash
all this clothes but it's we it's so
sweet you guys are just so kind oh my
gosh people behind so so what's your
peel box it's in our it's in my
description box every time you just have
to scroll down but you guys I just love
you all
um am I going to make a birth blog I
don't know I don't know that's gonna be
one of those things that you know I mean
there's definitely gonna be privacy well
you know there are certain things I'm
just not going to share you know but
definitely some of the blog's maybe
surrounding that time maybe and if we
did we might put them on our vlog
Tyler's vlog channel which is really our
vlog channel which is his uh I'm losing
my mind what am I saying his channel is
linked below where it says like travel
vlogs Disney that's his channel so if we
did we probably put it on there but um
so do I get random people touching my
belly surprisingly not too many
sometimes my students will hug me too
hard I told the kids the other day I
said listen you kids walk around really
quickly you keep running into my belly
sticking out farther than normal and
they laughs but I'm like but really
they're just you know they're fast and
they're ten ten-year-old little
squirrels and they'll walk by and just
run into my family I'm like guys hello
human here with another view one um how
far am i I'm 23 weeks I can't believe
that oh my gosh oh I see Melissa says
she's 14 weeks pregnant congratulations
food cravings I am not supposed to have
runny eggs and that is all I'm craving
I'm like no entire there's like are you
kidding me you usually don't like and I
love eggs but I usually love boiled eggs
I don't want to touch a boiled egg right
now I just want runny eggs and I'm not
other half
because of the risk of like I think it's
so Salmonella or I always want to say
Salmonella come on Jessica I think it's
a risk oh no Listeria someone oh
whatever it is there's a huge risk so it
makes me sad because that's all I want
but sour patch kids I've craved a lot
I'm trying to curb that when I've only
eaten it like once or twice because I'm
like Jessica that is literally just
nonsense but um I'm crazy up beer which
I never drink Ruby I really don't drink
pop often if I do it's sprite and that's
like very very rarely but I really crave
root beer so Tyler brought me some like
IBC root beer that everyone's albeit um
I teach fifth grade I see son okay you
guys want to see my bump oh my gosh why
do I get like nervous to show it I feel
like I'm not wearing like an appropriate
outfit okay she's kicking around in
there all righty here she is and all her
little glory
that's my leggings not my not my tongue
um she's doing so good
I she kicks like crazy and in the first
ultrasounds she know in every ultrasound
because we had all those issues we ended
up with literally four ultrasounds it's
so expensive but we I mean we literally
had to see like if the baby was okay
each time Olaf um you guys are so sweet
oh my gosh you make me feel better about
the fact that I've gained twenty
something oh my gosh um yes it's a girl
anyway so she moves around so much and
if he now that she's bigger you really
feel and Tyler still can't feel hurt I'm
like just put your hand right there and
he's like there she kicked he's like I
don't feel like when so if you guys okay
those of you that have had a baby um
what like at what point can your husband
boyfriend whatever feel it like he's and
I know like 23 weeks is still I mean
she's not that big she only gonna get
stronger but um I'm just curious like
what when should he be able to feel it
like I want him to feel so bad you can't
describe that feeling Oh
anyway
I see one of you guys said I gained 60
pounds was horrible I have to tell you
this though when we found out I was
pregnant I'd already I had just already
gained weight I don't know if it's you
know like I run all the time but like
we're just happy we moved into a home
and like we just been kind of complacent
we've been traveling a lot and so I had
already gained weight and so when I
found out I was pregnant like oh no oh
no I'm starting at not like an already
higher weight for me you know personally
knowing myself and it wasn't overweight
or anything but it was it was just
higher than I normally am so like man so
not only packing down on top of the
pounds I already packed on but I mean it
is what it is and I'm just glad she's
healthy I mean anyway um so a lot of
people are saying okay maybe 25 weeks
maybe 30 that he might feel a perlier in
six months okay so he's got time cuz I
know he's sad and I'm sad that he can't
feel but I know it'll it'll it'll happen
gosh
uh he gets me so excited I told myself I
wouldn't just talk about the baby and
everything on this and I'm but I can't
even I can't help it and it's funny
because before you have a baby you like
hear people talk about only their baby
and you're like you know what I mean
like you can't relate so it's like I
don't know and maybe I was just like
that you guys aren't but that's how I
always felt but now I'm like that's all
I want to talk about um okay well what
are our first travel plans with the new
baby I know we're working on actually a
big family vacation for my side of the
family I'm like in the fall and she's
due in May um so she's gonna be pretty
young but it'd be like a driving trip
all staying like in the same cabin or
Lodge or something so it'd be a lot more
laid-back which I would you know I'm
gonna be nervous anyway just because
we've never done it with the baby but
eventually Disney I think we are gonna
wait until she's a little bit older we
talked about like but we're just like
you know she's not gonna remember it now
we'll still do it I mean in the next few
years she'll still be way too young to
remember when we finally go but which is
kind of our thought obviously Disney is
huge to us
he's a Disney travel agent it just makes
sense do I have pregnancy brain yes
I've even told my students about it
because all just like in the middle of
teaching something I'll just like stop
and think was I saying
and I pregnancy anyway um how's my skin
been I keep getting breakouts but it's I
mean it's always in the same spot so
that's weird
that I can't figure out like there's one
here and then it just takes forever for
the redness to go down so I don't know
it's so so weird but it's nothing
terrible like for a while my skin was
crazy dry but I found some like amazing
products that I feel like are really
helping and so I feel like that's fixed
and I switched from using foundation to
just a BB cream right now because I'm
like I've got to give my skin a break
because I'm piling foundation on top of
it and right now my skin just can't
handle it so I switch to a BB three in
the past few weeks that's what I'm
wearing today and first of all it looks
just as good that's kind of my
realization but also I just feel like my
skin's breaking out less it can breathe
more it's not looking as dry and cakey
all that stuff so I'm feeling better you
guys want to know the products you want
to know um let me show you I've talked
about it on snapchat but one of them is
the Misha perfect cover BB cream I love
this stuff
it's got a pump it's I feel like I'm
filming a regular video right now it's
got a pump it I have it in the shade
number 23 they their shade range caters
to their I think it's I know it's a
Western perhaps asian beauty brand and
they're catering to those skin tones so
this one has kind of a gray tint but it
looks so nice like I have it on of
course the lights like I love this stuff
this is my favorite BB cream it's
definitely higher coverage and you're
used to and I I don't know where you get
this I'm gonna need to order another one
soon I don't remember where maybe they
sent it to me it was a long time ago
it's my favorite period it's the best
one out there so and it's got SPF of 42
which i think is pretty cool too how do
I apply it fingers that's it period
I've tried brushes I've tried everything
you I just rate up every morning I've
been squirting two pumps and just
literally playing with my fingers and it
looks flawless and ever
day I go in and wash my hands right
after cuz you know you got the gunk and
I'll look in the mirror and think why
don't I do this every single day it
looks so much better than foundation it
does because it covers but it just
doesn't look dry and it you know even
with your fingers it looks perfect
target has Misha someone said so um I
need to look into that because that
would be amazing
Amazon Nicole Rogers just said it's on
Amazon too you can order from the Misha
website um okay yeah see there I go I
can't think straight um what else what
else you want to talk about guys buying
my first high-end I shadow palette what
should you get um let me see okay I'm
just gonna name a few
this is like way too hard um okay I love
the sweet peach palette I just love it
but if you look at this palette and you
think mmm like you're not gonna wear the
shades then don't get it you really need
to think about regardless of what anyone
says there are a million amazing
palettes you need to look at the shades
inside will I actually wear most of
those if your answer is like not only
wear half then it's probably not worth
it chocolate bar palette I love as well
oh my gosh and I love a smell I have
fallen pretty hardcore in love with the
Jaclyn hill palette I gotta be honest I
figured it was all like not gimmicky cuz
how could it is shadow probably gimmicky
but I just kind of figured it was just
hyped up because of the name but it was
just the no this is this is amazing
don't let the blues and greens even fool
you this is amazing but it does I love
the way everything this place was really
nice the only thing I wish it had was a
matte like light nude like this color
but matte these are both shimmery and I
wish that's all I'm missing that's it so
I always have to pull in like my in
little wet and wild single brulee shadow
which is fine because that's amazing
but that's the only thing I wish were in
this what else what else oh this is one
that not many people talk about it it's
gonna be in my January favorites which
guys I haven't done a best and worse
like monthly favorites video in like a
couple months I literally realized the
other day and thought what how gonna
happen and I know the jammies like my
best of the year that kind of took over
for December but I don't think I did one
not
to her November so definitely doing one
I've already planted I was ready at my
little errand contrary to a book this is
one that I'm gonna mention it's the
persona identity palette she is a
youtuber Sona Gasparian and I love this
palette so much and I'm I don't know
exactly how much it is
I think it's sold on old toes wet site
but it's it's just beautiful so those
are just some of my favorites right now
I mean you could always go naked palette
if you like mats you can get the Kat Von
D shade + light that ones I mean that
one blends amazingly these are those are
all amazing but those get even pricier
here but I have another realization
mindful is Asian was I've been so stuck
in trying to make sure that I never
forget about drugstore products that
oh my other video is live yeah thanks
Sarasota
that's hilarious Luna a lawar best cream
for dry skin I'll answer your question
in just a second I'm gonna pull it out
so don't forget but my realization was
because I've for years been so worried
that I'll forget about drugstore and
move on and only talk about high-end
because I don't want to be that there
are too many youtubers out there that do
that and I know that's not me so because
of that I think I'm always so concerned
about ever mentioning products that are
really expensive and so and that
actually leads me into the moisturize
I'm gonna bring up so another
realization I've had I'm always on the
path of you know perfecting myself
mentally um is that I've got to stop
I've got to get out of the mindset of
not mentioning something just because
it's expensive because if it's one of
those products that is absolutely
amazing and I just love it then I should
be mentioning it and it's not to say
that I'm not mentioning them but I'll
kind of I feel like I'll be kind of
flipping about it this is really nice
but you don't need to spend the money
well sometimes it's absolutely worth it
so I want to be more not that I'm not
being honest but I hope you guys don't
see I just want to be more clear about
like no this is um it's expensive but it
is amazing period and not being as
apologetic about it maybe that's what it
is I feel like I'm always apologetic
when I mentioned something really
expensive but if it's amazing it's
amazing and that's why you guys are
watching YouTube videos that's why I
started watching them in the first place
it was an expensive product I was
thinking about buying and I wanted to
watch a review and see if it was worth
it so with that in mind the cream lunacy
answer your question I've mentioned on
snapchat as well this is new to me and
it just shot through the ranks best
moisturizer I've ever used ever ever
cosmetics humidified deep moisture and
firming hydrator this stupid sucker is
$90 i got it free this time i'm buying
it again
it's $90 i'm buying it again because
it's i don't even want to waste it but
you know it's just a squeezy tube
there's something about it i'll get a
little bit out that you know there's
nothing special when you look at it but
when you put it on the skin it's stupid
it's so good it's like not crazy it's
thick but it's not thick thick but it
just your my skin has drank it up and
over the past two weeks I feel like my
dry skin is just like on just gone all
the crazy pregnancy dry weirdness gone
and this is the only thing that's been
switched up this stupid stuff is amazing
I'll shout it from the rooftops I'm so
sorry it's expensive no Jessica you're
not to be apologetic it's expensive but
it's amazing what breathe Jessica just
breathe any wrinkles please I have
always got wrinkles
I'm waiting on stretch marks as I'm
getting bigger I'm like when are they
come in they're gonna come my sister
Azzam I'm like I know what's gonna
happen
but I asked my mom cuz my mom doesn't
really have stretch marks what'd she
have like seven what six
technically seven um kids that's the
story for another day
anyway seven kids and like how in the
world did she now have stretch marks I
asked my mom like mom what did you do
you know when you were having all this
and she said I just used baby oil in the
shower I'm like that's it she's like
yeah and I put like lotion on any
special lotion
no look so either and I know they always
say like it could be genetic but it's
interesting that my mom didn't have and
my sister did so I'm like so is that my
dad's skin she's getting the fur I'm oh
you know you try to figure it out
so I'm just kind of assuming I'm gonna
get them
because I don't want to feel like
there's anything wrong with that there's
nothing wrong with that you just freakin
grew a human made a child like there's
nothing wrong with that I think there's
something so beautiful in it but at the
same time you want to be as preventive
as possible so I've been using some oils
like right now I'm using a oh gosh what
using it's called
Oh I'm just using like the Neutrogena
body oil like sensitive skin whatever in
the shower and then you know you just
bite in the bass section and I want to
try the oh it's L'Occitane like their
almond oil but it's really expensive but
I so much right like it's like an in
shower oil and then when I get out I
still like to put another oil on it and
right now I can't think what I'm using
I'll have to put it in description box
later but and then the lotion I'm using
right now is like from Shea Moisture and
it's like a shea butter but it's like
natural so you have to like warm it in
your hands because it's kind of gritty
but then it it like melts and it's so
moisturizing and it's specifically for
mommy bellies so we'll see Palmer's
that's what it is it's the like stretch
mark oil like the Palmer's I can't think
what it's actually called um anyway I
like that Sara said I call them my tiger
stripes there's another bonus that I
have seven kids
hashtag tiger stripes so I'm just kind
of trying to go about it with an open
mind because it's a beautiful thing what
we've all done having a kid and hmm
vitamin E oil Melissa says I will look
into that too um cocoa butter Belva okay
sorry I'm so thirsty right now um all
right what else should we talk about
something other than the baby
I feel bad um I told Tyler I was like
Tyler I'm about to film a live video
also I'm hungry I'm just letting you
know last night we were in bed and he
had made this like lentil you know we're
trying to eat as healthy as possible
he made this like lentil soup I think
it's literally French lentil soup it's
so good you put a little sour cream so
delicious
anyway so it's I mean other than sour
cream it was it's literally lentils and
it's so good so he'd eaten that and I
think that's all we had like it was a
very healthy dinner and we're laying in
bed like two three hours later and we're
watching Bob's Burgers that's mistake
number one because every time we watch
Bob's Burgers we get hungry for burgers
which is like every night and so we
literally we were just watching it in
time I was like man it just makes me
want McDonald's I'm like dude don't
don't bring that name into this house
cuz I will want it too and he said I'm
just saying I know we're in PJs and it
is like 10:30 p.m. but if you said Tyler
I want McDonald's I will get up drive
and go get mcdonalds like don't put this
on me because then I'm gonna say yes and
then we're both gonna meet McDonald's
tonight so then I said how about this
we're not gonna get it tonight cuz we
weren't even like hungry but maybe
tomorrow and so tomorrow is right now so
now I'm like maybe I should be like
maybe tunnels he's gonna make
cauliflower soup again super healthy but
I also want McDonald's oh my god it's
just like my guilty pleasure what's on
my eyes what is on my eyes Oh Milani oh
and I also learned I again this was on
my snapchat because I get ready on there
in the mornings you guys should come
watch it's so fun I mean I only show
what I'm using and things like that well
I'm wearing this Milani palette called
bold obsessions and yeah that is what
I'm wearing it was $20 online but a lot
of you guys snapped me today and said
it's only 15 at Walmart I was like that
is awesome even more this palette is
stupid amazing this is another one I'm
pretty sure I'm mentioning in my January
favorites I'm wearing this know this
shade over here all over the lid it's a
really pretty like oh my gosh and then I
think I use like maybe that in the
crease just a bit maybe that in the
crease it's I mean it's worn down I've
had a full day of working and stuff but
these palettes are amazing so that's the
bold obsessions it's matte and shimmer
but then my most loved mass is all that
and it is so gorgeous these are so
gorgeous they
beautifully they swatch beautifully I I
can't believe these are drugstore I
literally can't believe it this has to
be the first time I've ever felt this
strongly that how in the heck is this
dress repel I'll never understand I
don't know
but also I used this have you guys heard
of this brand guys orgy's or Glee's or
Glee say I don't know um
face FX like contour palette it came in
the mail randomly I use it today I
freaking love it I literally looked in
the mirror at the end of my work day and
thought that looks really nice
I'm obsessed with this like matte cream
shade because I just put it look at that
that's so pigmented I just cleaned up
like my whole face with it and it looks
so nice and the contour the bronzer the
highlight they're just amazing oh my
gosh amazing so I'm really excited I
want to find out I almost have to assume
this brand is expensive it just seems
really nice but um this is the one it's
called their contour powder collection
the moonlight series which is for fair
to light so I'm sure they have other
shade ranges
anywho my palette fell off okay what
else what else what else
what's going on guys um how are my
students they are awesome
I don't there's I love my students this
year how's my voice yeah I had some
issues with literally okay so I'm a
singer I hate like saint- see her um but
like I I genuinely love to sing and like
Tyler and I we did shout like musical
theater show so yeah that's how we met
and uh-huh
so I do love to sing and so does he and
I hadn't been seen in a long time
because I haven't been in the show in a
long time
because I've been working and my throat
like I couldn't sing anymore it was so
weird and so I learned that I had vocal
notes I went to an ENT and they're like
dude you have freaking vocal notes and
they stuck a camera up my nose down my
throat was the craziest craziest feeling
um but he said honestly it's probably
not from you singing cuz I haven't been
doing he said it's probably just from
talking at school
so I now have a microphone actually all
of the classrooms at our school have
microphones but I was always like they
don't meet a microphone that's weird and
then I started wearing it my voice
started healing itself I do feel like
though lately I've been talking a lot
more and I do feel like it's kind of
taking a toll again and my nodes had
healed a lot so I need to kind of like
I say that as I'm talking hmm all right
Brooke Clark looked it up she said this
POW is $40 might be worth it
it Jenny I mean it's so nice I want to
use it some more but I am so impressed
with this but yeah 40 bucks um all right
yeah a lot of people are saying I've had
nodules Oh patrols all right do I still
plan do you mean like school like lesson
plants if so yes um my class I have 27
kiddos you have to sing to your bump
that's why I'm gonna make Tyler sing to
it that's so sweet
we have been playing some music some
just classical music for it at night
like I'll just play we're trying to play
the same song cuz I've heard we've been
playing Brahms Lullaby because I have
heard that whatever you know they're
kind of used to hearing and it includes
your own voice too but whatever they're
used to hearing like say I play the same
song every single night and you know in
there they're all cozy and you know at
ease that that can become a song once
they're born that when you play it can
kind of put them at ease when they're
you know stressed out you know what I
mean I don't know if that's sorry I
don't know if that's true or not it'd be
cool if it was um anyway if you want to
see my bump I showed it a little while
ago I don't know the timestamp but um
Tyler and I have singing together or was
it just me singing I don't remember on
his channel we've done some vlogs who
were singing so you have to look back
but Luthien Taoiseach Kim Haines said to
play Fantasia
that's awesome what's your ideal date
night I'll tell you right now
going to one of those movie theaters
where you can eat while watching the
movie we almost did that tonight again
but I think we're gonna do it this
weekend that's my favorite there's a
place called flix Brewhouse and you can
go and you can eat a meal and watch a
movie and it is amazing and of course I
mean now I can't have it but Tyler can
get a beer and back a long time ago I
could get a glass of wine and it was so
nice so that's my absolute favorite date
night period which sounds funny because
it's like Tyler and I aren't even
talking but we both just love it like
you just completely unwind cuz I mean I
talk all the time like we just like will
sit and just like talk after work but
yeah alright so Oh a lot of guys are
asking me to do a video on how I do my
naturally curly wavy hair sure I can do
a video on that I think if I do I'm
gonna think about like what are my
favorite products like of all time I've
ever used and I want to use those so you
can really see like in an ideal
situation when I have these products
this is my favorite way to do it so you
guys can see that um
Sooni wanted to know what my snapchat
name is it's just jammed beauty 89 on
there Jim viewed 89 um could I do a
winter Disney packing video that's so
tricky and I I don't do packing news we
did I did pack and show a little bit of
my packing again I'm sorry I keep
mentioning Tyler's channel but that's
where so much of our content goes
I did mention packing and showed some of
my stuff in our Disney vlogs that he
just put up the earlier ones I'm on his
channel so anyway um cool a tamer said
would I ever go on a brand trip I've
technically been on brand trips but it
wasn't like going to like an island or
like a faraway country the only - I've
been on one was with elf actually I
mention it in the alcohol that just went
live on my channel I went to New York
with elf they like flew me out there and
it was fun I got to meet a lot of people
is first time I'm so nervous
oh my gosh probably so awkward
that was so so much fun but it was like
a day or two and then the only other one
I've gone is when two-face flew me out
to LA to go to like their sweet peach
party that likes everyone was at that
was interesting that wasn't interesting
it was fun I mean it was it was a
positive experience but just interesting
things that happened that night but I
got to meet so many amazing other
youtubers especially a lot of youtubers
that maybe have smaller channels I ended
up following tons of them and I still
comment on their videos and watch them
all because you're just lovely so that
part of it was really really cool do I
think I'm gonna go on a lot more I don't
know to be honest with you guys they end
up just being more awkward than anything
because you don't really know anyone I
know there's a lot of youtubers they're
like BFFs with other youtubers and they
like hang out all the time
well where I live in Indiana they're not
a lot of other you to I mean there are
other youtubers but not a ton in the
beauty sphere that I personally know or
have met yet and while I do think there
there are definitely certain youtubers
that I feel like if I ever met them in
person I'd be like we're like we would
just get along so well and it wouldn't
be awkward cuz I feel like I already
know them um but yeah so I don't know
how many more I'd want to go on unless
they'd let me like bring my whole
freaking family like I mean like my
husband and then my future they did that
order okay let's just see how this goes
because it's just interesting it's
interesting and at least in the two
experiences I've had they've never said
you must post this newest but I think if
you go to like a faraway place that
they're sending you that's when they
probably would have like a contract of
some kind I don't know I've never
experienced that I don't know um
alrighty so I think I might go my throat
is like killing me I'm like alright
that's my body saying you are done but
um okay wait one last question
deidre just asks how did you tell Tyler
you were preggers we actually kind of
both thought I might be and so I bought
a pregnancy test for literally the first
time in my entire life and that
experience was awkward like I went to a
logging like looking around and I
finally find him like which one do they
get it like there's so many and I'm like
do I get an expensive one to make sure
it's right but then I'm like my sister's
voice in the back of my head like no you
could learn it by him at the Dollar Tree
and those are right - you know what I
mean so
just bought one middle-of-the-road and
then I go to checkout and the guy was so
awkward because it was all I was buying
I should have bought like a pack of gum
this is all I was buying so he is
probably a little younger than me and
just kind of awkward in so he rings it
up and but the bag and all he said was I
hope how did he so I don't want to screw
it up he said I hope the results are
what you're expecting
Inara what you want it's like cuz what
else do you say like it's so awkward to
either don't say anything which is
probably the better option but you don't
want to say oh I hope you're pregnant
because what if you don't want to be and
then vice versa but just it was open I
hope the results are what you want I was
like thank you and in that moment I'm
like I don't really know what I want
because we hadn't really talked about
any much so that was so then we did the
whole thing and we just like I covered
it and waited and after a few minutes we
looked at the same time and it was a
very exciting moment it's one of those
moments I'll never forget so it wasn't
really telling him we were kind of a
team in this and finding out together it
was it was exciting
okay wait one more question Emily
Armstrong said favorite resort in each
category at Disney value moderate deluxe
oh my gosh alright my favorite value is
definitely pop century definitely
although I love the All Stars like I
love ulcer music but I think I like pop
century more and they just renovated the
rooms and they're really cool my
favorite moderate resort Port Orleans
Riverside slash French Quarter but I
think I like Riverside more I just love
it the grounds they're so beautiful I
love it so much and then my favorite
Deluxe I don't know that I can pick
between the Grand Floridian contemporary
and Polynesian and Wilderness Lodge I
love all of them and there's even more
but those are like my top four I might
have to say contemporary because it was
so much fun this past trip being able to
walk to the Magic Kingdom and back like
in three or four minutes and like the
monorails right there and the TTC is
right there it might be contemporary
which I never liked five years ago if
you'd asked me and I had to say there I
know I would have said I don't get it
like why do people say the contemporary
doesn't look very pretty it's amazing so
I don't know I can't pick but maybe
contemporary
all righty so um I love you guys so much
I really do and these videos make me my
heart happy because I really was feeling
kind of down about if you saw the
beginning of the live video if you
haven't you might want to rewind at the
end but I was kind of talking about how
I've been feeling down about my channel
because I feel like I'm not quite I'm
being more of myself but it's not uh
it's not the standard I think I kind of
expect of myself and so I'm gonna keep
working on that but I love you guys and
thank you for being here and chatting
and um oh it's hard for me to sign off
because I always want to just keep
talking but thank you for listening to
me Yammer on and on and on and I will
see you guys I hope that you will go
check out my elf video that just went
live my best and worse and I news read
someone said they're worried they keep
feeling like that door is gonna open
like any minute I do too I keep waiting
for Tyler to be okay so do you want
McDonald's and I'll be like no do that
do you want it or not I'd be like no
anyway we'll see what we had never
having anyway I love you guys and I'll
chat with you guys soon that was a weird
kiss bye okay bye for real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
