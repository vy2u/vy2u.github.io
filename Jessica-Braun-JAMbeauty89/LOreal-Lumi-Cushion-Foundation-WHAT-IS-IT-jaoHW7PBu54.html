sharing with you my review and demo of
the new L'Oreal Lumi cushion buildable
luminous foundation I'm wearing the
shade W - the packaging is really simple
it's like a rose gold which is really
really pretty I think the packaging is
gorgeous to be honest but it opens and
you see there's a mirror and then
there's this little puff and then this
plastic part that holds the puff opens
to reveal the cushion underneath with
the foundation inside of the question of
course I'm gonna use this to apply it
today because I find that out of all the
ways I've applied it that's the best way
to apply this kind of a foundation other
than that let's go ahead and get into
the demo and then I'll get into kind of
the pros and cons of whether or not I
would actually recommend this product
okay so I'm gonna show you how I've been
applying this I've actually been using
the sponge that it comes with but the
only downside is it you know I haven't
tried cleaning it yet but this isn't
something it's a very specific kind of
sponge so I'm kind of on the lookout to
buy replacements cuz I feel like this
will get really gross really quickly so
that is the biggest downside so far so
I'm just gonna take the sponge it's on
my fingers and literally just tap it
into the product you can see it's on
there now so I'm just gonna start in the
middle of my face and just start patting
it in I mean it's as simple as that and
I don't have any primer on my face at
all I don't always wear primers anyway
this one still looks good with the
primer but I just wanted to show you
what it looks like with nothing on
because not everyone wears primers so
you can already tell that a lot of the
redness on my nose is gone but it's not
perfectly blended in yet but let's go
ahead and get the foundation all over
the rest of my face and then we'll worry
about what it looks like so I feel like
on my cheek you can see it the most the
coverage so you can see all kinds of
marks there I wear the shade w2 in this
so yeah you can already see
covered like an essentially one-pass and
now I'm just kind of pushing it into the
skin in one pass it covered most of that
that blows my mind because I feel like
with regular traditional liquid
foundations I feel like I'm consistently
having to blend and blend and blend but
then the problem is it's just it blends
away you know what I mean and so then
there's no coverage so then I've got to
put another layer on but with this stuff
I don't necessarily feel that I need
another I'm only getting a little bit
for this area of my face cuz I don't
truly need need foundation there so now
what I'm going to do just to ensure I'm
kind of lightly pulling it oops down my
jawline you know you could get more and
Pat it but the shade difference isn't
that different for me it's pretty
accurate so for me I don't I'm not too
worried about like a line but I need to
make sure it's blended so I don't have
concealer on or anything yet but let me
kind of go over just that this is all I
have on my face I feel like it really
does cover a lot and it I was so
skeptical but it's got pretty good
coverage it feels comfortable on the
skin it's still a little bit tacky
especially here where I had more of it
put on there but that's one pass so
let's see if we can get you know you can
still see a little bit here let's see if
we can get even higher coverage so for
those that might need a little bit more
I did not think I would like this stuff
I have to be real with you guys I
thought it was like gimmicky and I'm
like there's no way that's going to work
I do feel like it's got a little bit of
a dewy finish to it I personally like
that I feel like it makes you just look
youthful but if you don't like that you
would definitely need to set this with
something if you don't want that do we
look at all but honestly um I just think
it's a natural glow to it and once I get
you know all my other makeup on it's
really gonna come together so clearly I
like it well enough it really does even
out my skin tone really really well
here's the deal if you're someone that
really problematic skin that you're
trying to cover a lot this is not gonna
cover that stuff for you so if that's
you then I would say this isn't gonna
work for you but if you're someone that
maybe you just have some stuff to hide
like me I have some freckles some you
know dark spots from past breakouts
things like that this would work and I
like it because it just feels
comfortable on the skin period so day to
day I typically will wear like just a BB
cream but this is something that the way
that it feels reminds me of a BB cream
and it's just as easy to apply because
I'm just pressing it into the skin and
I'm done umm I really really like that
the ease of application it's and it's
just kind of different maybe that's part
of it it's just the novelty of it I know
these have been really big out east but
you know they really are new here in
America so many of us not all of us so
for me the novelty of it is just
exciting but I am excited to see you
know as other brands here in America
come out with their own versions of this
how this would stack up against the
other ones so the price point for this
I'm on ulties website right now and it's
1699 it's still pricey for what it is so
you know for 20 that's nearly 20 dollars
you could get like a really good map
concealer that I love I mean there's a
lot you could spend that money on so I
would say if you are not really looking
for a medium coverage foundation then
there's no point in buying this but what
I do like about it is that it does let
your skin's natural glow shine through
which a lot of foundations don't so
that's where that lumi name comes in I
really do feel like it is luminous but
not overwhelmingly luminous now if you
have really oily skin it might be too
luminous for you because it's mixing
with oil on your face but if you have
not if you've got dry skin or you've got
combo I think you'd really like the
formula of this I think that this is a
foundation that when you're really up
close you can see that you're wearing
foundations so you know it's not a super
you know from here I think it looks semi
natural but up close I mean it does not
look as natural as like a BB cream or a
tinted moisturizer would I don't think
it's necessarily
but just so that you're aware there's
not really a noticeable smell I didn't
even notice when going on but like I
mentioned one thing I would change is
this little puff I might try and clean
it at some point I don't know that
that's one of the downsides maybe I'll
run out of this before because I know
there's not a lot in this this is 0.51
ounces and most most foundations so I
can out so it really it doesn't have a
lot of foundation in it either so it's
really expensive and there's not a lot
in it so on Elsa's website they've got
12 shades it looks like there's like one
that's really deep but not a ton of deep
colors so yet again the drugstore not
offering as many shades as they should
as not as big of a range as they should
I would say my final verdict on this if
you're a makeup junkie like me you might
want to try it just again for the
novelty of it I'll wear this I'll
probably use this stuff that's what I'll
say I like it enough that I'm going to
use it up because I think it's so easy
to throw on in the morning when I'm
getting up really early and trying to
get ready quickly I like it I like the
way it looks it matches me really really
well but if you can't find a match
that's a whole nother thing
you know other than that if you've got
really oily skin or you really don't
like that price point of like 17 dollars
I would say stay away it's not something
that's life-changing I've only been
using it for a couple weeks now so you
know maybe I'll change my mind in a few
months but I don't think I will I think
I've pretty much decided how I feel
about this I like it but it's not for
everyone
hopefully that review was helpful for
you guys if you are interested in seeing
more of my drugstore review and demo
videos like this one I will link my
playlist below I have reviewed and
demoed a ton of different drugstore
foundations so this is not the one for
