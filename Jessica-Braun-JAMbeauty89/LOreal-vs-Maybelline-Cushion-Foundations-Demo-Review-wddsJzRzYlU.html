I'm going to share with you my review
and comparison of two different
drugstore cushion foundations today
we're comparing the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi cushion with the Maybelline Dream
cushion so I have the shade w2 and
L'Oreal and I have the shade 20 and
Maybelline I think 20 is a little bit
darker maybe a little bit more yellow
than this L'Oreal one but they're both a
pretty good match I do think the L'Oreal
1 and W 2 is a better match for me but
I'm going to go ahead and show you the
demo now of me applying the L'Oreal to
this half of my face in the maybelline
to this half of my face what I'm wearing
today so let's go ahead and get into the
demo and then afterwards I'll tell you
about kind of the pros and cons of both
in which I would recommend overall ok so
I'm going to start by putting on a
primer get my hair out of the way here
I'm just going to use the it cosmetics
bye bye pores primer I like this primer
it's not my favorite primer in the world
I'm still kind of trying it out I know a
lot of people like phrase about this
stuff I like it but I'm going to put it
just absolutely everywhere
it definitely makes my face look lighter
than it already is I think I got a
little too much but it definitely does
feel silky smooth so I can see why a lot
of people like it sometimes I think when
my skin is really really dry it
accentuates it just a little bit but
rights on my skin doing okay so so I'm
going to apply the l'oreal to the right
side of my face and then I'll do the
maybelline on the left side of my face
so it's the opposite for you I think but
so I am in the shade w2 in the L'Oreal
Lumi cushion I've had this a while
somehow this got all ripped up I
honestly opened it the other day and I
was like what happened so I don't know I
wonder if like my dog kind of it I don't
know anyway so again you just like a
normal Christian foundation you just
push it into here I do think I'm
starting to run out so I need to put the
cushion over but let's just see how this
applies
so I definitely think that it evens out
my skin tone you know looking at it in
the mirror here it's a good color match
for me it really really is so if you
struggle if you've got a similar skin
tone to mine you will love this it's one
of the few drugstore foundations that
color wise really genuinely matches me
as very rare for me to find and I'm sure
that's true for many of us I think it
does a great job it's not crazy dewy and
that's really important when you see me
apply this next one the maybelline one
so let's go ahead and do that one this
one I'm going to use the shade twenty I
have twenty and thirty they sent these
to me a while ago I think if I were at
the store I would have bought ten and
twenty maybe if I were to buy two but
the same exact kind of sponge same exact
packaging this one I think might be a
little deeper trying to remember so I'm
curious to see these side-by-side I
might look like I've got two different
foundation zones yeah this one is a
little bit more yellow
I'm going to apply this a little bit of
this Maybelline brightening creamy
concealer because it's a couple of
shades too dark for me do you see that
so I figure you know this is just mostly
texture at this point but it's kind of
nice to have something on it and I like
to just use this to just kind of push it
in and in a way blend it without
actually blending it you know what I
mean
so here it's kind of my final verdict as
I look at it like up close here I think
both of them are really nice I have
normal to dry skin so and winter my
skin's a little bit more dry I
definitely don't have Olli skin so keep
in mind that's my perspective there are
a lot of oily skin gals on YouTube see
what they say about it because I really
don't know for sure but I do know my
skin and I've been trying to L'Oreal one
much much much longer because it's been
out for longer and I do feel like this
one is a healthy satin finish but it's
not super duly whereas I think the
Maybelline one hat gives a little bit
more life to your face in a good way in
my opinion so you know they apply the
same the sponges the exact same so the
application there's no difference but I
do think that I think I might like to
Maybelline one a little bit more because
I think it does allow a little bit more
of your skin to shine through in a dewy
way but they both have in my opinion the
same amount of coverage maybe the
Maybelline has a little bit more but
looking at it I really don't know
you know when ignoring the obvious
pimple but like I have a same amount of
pigmentation other than that on both of
my cheeks and I feel like the coverage
is the same now I since the L'Oreal
wants kind of running out I think I
wouldn't have had to have applied as
much of it or as many times I should say
if it were as full as this Maybelline
one is so and that's kind of the thing
about cushion foundations once you to
use one side and you flipped and use the
other they run out really quickly much
much quicker than a normal you know
liquid foundation in a jar or a tube or
something like that but that's just kind
of a nature of that kind of product
that's not really a brand specific thing
so I feel like now seeing both side by
side and kind of having this on for a
couple hours while I filmed a little bit
and eating a little bit of the eating
really messes with your foundation but
you guys do try me I feel like they both
look
to say the only difference I mean the
only difference like I mentioned in the
demo is that I think the maple you want
is a little bit more dewy but you know I
have highlighter on here but I feel like
it just looks healthy on the skin if
you've got dry or normal skin like me if
you have oily skin like I mentioned
might want to find reviews from those
that have oily skin to determine if it
be right for you because while I don't I
think there are way more dewy
foundations out there like way more I
don't think this is on the like high end
of the spectrum but I do think it does
have that kind of fresh-faced glowy look
to it just to a certain extent and of
course if you wanted more glow you could
add a more glowy primer I put on that by
record so it kind of mattifies your face
and I think that's why it doesn't look
as oily on me as it might on someone
else so that's something to keep in mind
that if you already have it or you
really want to try it and then you try
and you're like oh my gosh my face is an
oily mess with it you could just try it
with a more pore filling primer or just
a more mattifying primer something that
will maybe address your skin needs but
still you know you can still get use out
of it I don't think these are super high
coverage but I think if you don't have a
lot of skin imperfections it will do a
really nice job like I feel like it did
a pretty good job I didn't put any
powder foundation on top of it or
anything like that I did use shape tape
here this concealer because I also found
a demo on a review of this today so and
if that is up I will link it below if
it's not stay tuned it will be very very
soon but anyway I could talk about that
for a while but that did perfect this
area I think a little bit more but other
than that I think it really does look
nice they both come with exactly 0.51
ounces I wonder why that extra one I
don't know
so they come at the exact same amount of
product like I said the packaging is
exactly the same size everything I think
the L'Oreal one might be cuter but it
also shows fingerprints because of that
so it's like not that it really matters
but you know a lot of us are shallow and
you're like oh so much prettier though
which is so pretty like bronzy rose gold
and that's exactly right thing I like
them both I don't think you can go wrong
either way like I said I do want to buy
a new one of the L'Oreal just because
it's almost run out but it's kind of
quickly these are really quickly rising
up in the ranks
what I like to use on my face because
I'm just so I'm always surprised at how
nice they look now I will say we're
timewise I don't think these we're as
long as like a normal foundation because
you're applying such a thin layer of it
I think unless you have a really good
primer underneath that you know works
really well with your skin I think it
can tend to start to not have as much
coverage about six seven eight hours
into the day now of course the beauty of
this is it is so quick and on the go you
know you don't need a separate brush or
anything you've already got what you
need to apply it right there so with
that in mind you could totally bring it
with you but for me it usually breaks
the part on my nose and up here so I
could just take it and reapply it but if
you know it breaks apart on you and your
cheeks and you've also applied blush or
bronzer or highlight you're not
necessarily going to want to put this on
top of that I mean you could but it
would just be you know you wouldn't be
able to see your highlight anymore maybe
things like that so it's something to
keep in mind you might want to reapply
throughout the day if you're not doing
anything strenuous I think it's fine
like if you're going to the gym it's
probably gonna break up a little bit but
if you're going and you're like going to
be I don't know just doing something
less strenuous I think it would probably
wear fine
I wear it teaching by the end of the day
I don't think it's perfect but it's not
like so bad that I'm like oh my gosh I
need to reapply usually fine and I'll
still go out you know maybe for dinner
that night without touching that part of
my face up and it looks fine price-wise
geez I think it's like a $1 different
tool Orioles like $1 more than this on
the Ulta website smell wise if you're
sensitive to smell neither one of them
have a noticeable smell I mean I feel
like all cushions on Nations have this
certain like smell that I think it's
more that cushion than anything but you
don't notice that when you're putting it
on you don't notice that once it's on so
again I don't think that will bother you
if you are sensitive hopefully this
