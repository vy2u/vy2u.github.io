is like very full because I finally
purchased a bunch of makeup I am very
expensive very luxurious that I've had
on my wish list for a very long time and
I finally bit the bullet and I
I've been trying these now most of these
for about a week so it's still kind of
my initial impression / a haul but I
will do an update here and about a month
or so and let you guys know how they're
working for me as I've used them more
now this video is sponsored by shop
tagger I've worked with them before this
is an online tool that you can use to
organize basically your lists when it
comes to purchasing things I use it for
makeup and fashion items so for me I've
got on there my wishlist and then I've
got my old faves so what I'll do is I'll
add some of my favorite products that I
know I repurchase over and over again
what I love about it is when you add the
items to your different lists you can
check for them to alert you when it is
back in stock if it's out of stock or
you can have them alert you when there's
any price change so if it ever goes on
sale they'll send you a little alert and
then you'll know and you think maybe
knows I'm right so that's nice for my
old favorites but also for these
wishlist items because some were out of
stock and I was waiting for them and so
once everything that I wanted was in
stock at the same time I was like okay
we're doing this we're buying it and so
I feel like for me I'm not gonna go back
I bought these from Beauty lish and it
was my very first time hoarding from
them and so I didn't want to order a
bunch of separate times I really wanted
to wait till everything was in stock so
without shop tiger I don't know that I
would have checked every single day to
see so it was really nice to be able to
have that tool to be able to use it so
if you're interested in trying out shout
tiger definitely check my link below to
check it out otherwise let's go and get
into it let's start with the first thing
I put on my face today other than like
primer and stuff I finally picked up the
charlotte tilbury magic foundation this
has sunscreen SPF of 15 I am NOT gonna
lie I twisted it open and I thought what
in the world what kind of applicator is
this it wasn't like a dropper it wasn't
like a paddle or a doe foot no you
freaking idiot Jessica you just pull it
off it's a pump
oh my gosh embarrassing anyway so you
figured that out I have it in the shade
number two this is a perfect shade match
for me I'm wearing it today I apply it
with my favorite L'Oreal sponge it's
just nice it's it's not so thick but
it's not so thin and it covers enough of
what I want to cover but it makes your
skin still like look like skin does that
make sense it doesn't get weird and
creepy in areas I've been testing out a
lot of foundations lately to decide if
I'm gonna keep them or get rid of them
and so many of them I mean when I
compare those to this it's like comical
this is so much better so so far very
impressed I've probably used it maybe
four or five times now so I'll continue
to use it let you know and I've used it
with a different primer I think
virtually every single day every single
day it still looks amazing so it doesn't
seem to be too finicky depending on the
primer you have underneath and that I
really like about it to where timewise I
feel like it lasts pretty well
throughout the day I mean by the end of
a work day everything breaks apart on my
nose unless I use like a really poor
filling primer or something like that
plus I've got like kind of a cold going
on so I'm touching my nose so I feel
like that's kind of a variable that I'm
like well once I maybe not touching my
nose as much it might last longer but I
do feel like it lasts there at the work
day really nicely let's talk about what
is on my eyes I finally well I mean it's
still really new so it's not really it
finally but I picked up the UH Nastasia
soft glam palette I know so many people
were like that POW looks really boring
but I'm like dude boring is my middle
name
I love its palette it was a good one
Jess you should put that put that in
your brain for later you use that again
but seriously I love boring palettes
because that's just me I like neutral
looks do I have colors like this in my
collection absolutely do I have this
combo I don't know I need to kind of
comb through but today what I put on my
eyes is I put burnt orange all over the
lid and kind of into the crease and then
I used orange soda a bit to kind of
that up and then tempura or tempura I
feel like it's tempura anyway I put that
all under the brow bone and kind of use
it to blend as well and then what else
oh I used noir which is just a beautiful
matte black on my lower lash line and as
my liner today and it's so black it is
so beautiful and then CN I used a little
bit on my lower lash line as well to
help blend and then actually the shimmer
you see is the Mac pigment in tan so I
didn't use the shimmer not really for
any reason other than I just wanted to
use my Mac pigment today you know what I
mean but these shimmers are really
really pretty the only shade that
there's like two shades that are kind of
glittery shimmer and that would be
sultry and bronze they still work fine
but you definitely I mean it's the
classic kind of a shadow where you
definitely want to use either mac fix+
when you apply it or a really sticky
primer something to kind of ensure that
there's not as much fallout because
there definitely will be but absolutely
stunning stunning palette I have used
different shades every single day that
I've used this and it's been about a
week and I've used it I think every
single day just about so I'm really
really enjoying it I think of course
their packaging is so cool it gets dirty
so easily which stinks but it's so I
just love it
oh my gosh I have to say this I like
this better than the modern renaissance
the modern renaissance is gorgeous and I
absolutely adore it however the shades
aren't as wearable for me so I only pull
that palette out when I'm like oh I'm
gonna do like a red pink kind of a look
this is something I can use every single
day so if you've been waiting and you
look at their palettes and you think I
don't know like I feel like it's not
really up my alley I probably wear them
and you see this one you think well
maybe you probably will use this more
often I'm drinking some tea and you guys
gotta let me know you know when you
drink tea or anything and slowly but
surely you start to get like that
moustache of lipstick or lip gloss you
guys you have to let me know if we get
there so I can clean it up another
product that I'm wearing today is this
Tom Ford bronzing powder in Terra I'd
heard so many people talk about this
okay I'm wearing it today I think it
looks really nice however this took a
lot of effort to get it to look like
this is weird it was like splotchy
and I guess now that I'm saying that at
least today when I noticed it was
splotchy I felt like I don't think I had
powdered all of my skin underneath it so
maybe that was a part of it but I felt
like I couldn't blend it and then the
other few days I've used this I used a
different brush one that wasn't as dense
and it I felt like I couldn't get enough
on it was really weird and that's like
never a problem for me because I do have
semi fair skin so I don't know I felt
like I needed to use a denser brush with
this which is fine but when you do make
sure you're putting it on top of powder
and not on top of a sticky foundation
because obviously it's gonna stick in
certain areas that would be true for
most bronzers but anyway I guess what
I'm saying is this is really expensive
and I kind of envisioned it being like
this unbelievable bronzer like best I've
ever used and I just kind of feel so so
about it I'll keep trying it I might
change my tune as I try it more but I
mean of course the packaging is stupid
pretty they know what we like darn it
they know what we like the highlighter I
am wearing today is from Shoei I feel
like I own virtually nothing from ziwei
and so when I saw that this was in stock
this was citrine oh my gosh it's a
highlighter it's incredibly pigmented
but it's like it's like not powder it
definitely is powder it's not a cream
but it has this feel to it that I've
never really felt before even when
you're swatching it's like what it's not
like the colour-pop shadows not like
that it's a powder but it's so creamy it
feels like a weird gel but it's not a
gel
I don't anyway so I put it on and I feel
like I've even okay let me be very clear
when I put this makeup look on and then
I took a nap
and then I got up to film so I've napped
and I didn't rely really anything other
than my lip product and I feel like I
mean it just it's so pretty it's so
flattering and I was a little nervous
when I saw this online I thought it'd be
a little too dark for my skin tone but
no I feel like it looks so so so nice so
that was a good one good good good
probably the best item oh that's hard to
say but maybe the best item I bought
although the the palette is really close
the hilar is closed and the foundation
is really closed this is also from
Charlotte Tilbury again this is new
territory for me I only own a couple
Charlotte Tilbury things and anyway this
is their airbrush flawless finish skin
perfecting micro powder I have it in the
shade number one fair I had heard you
guys recommend this because I said I
need a better under eye powder I feel
like I've tried a lot of drugs on ones
and I really like some of them but I've
never found that one that is like the
best thing in the entire universe this
now is the first time I use it I thought
no freaking way is this this good so I
thought oh certainly it'll look weird
throughout the day no look the same all
day long and here's why this is amazing
to me and what I've been looking for it
doesn't settle into your fine lines and
look creepy that is the number one
problem the second you put powder on
your under eye to settle to set like you
know so that your concealer does
increase well sure many of them will
make sure that it doesn't crease but
then it's emphasizing all your dryness
and texture and it's still emphasizing
your fine lines this I feel like does
that the least can I still see my fine
lines a bit yes yes but it shows them so
much less than any other powder I've
tried loose powders powders like pressed
powders none of them compared to this
none of them and it brightens but it's
not so bright that looks fake like I
said I'm wearing it today
I've even dipped my it's so silky and
finely milled that I can lightly touch
my wet sponge in there and even use it
like I'll just press my sponge here and
cleaned up this area I did the same
thing and put it on my nose and it clean
that up like this is something that I am
it literally makes me want to get rid of
every single other powder I have for
that purpose and I'm not joking I'm in a
declutter e mode and I'm
really thinking like maybe I just get
rid of all of them and keep this because
it's it's so much better why even mess
around with it this is like my quest and
I finally found the best one so I know
it's expensive I know I'm like raving
but this is unfreaking believable
unbelievable and it is very rare for me
to say something is that unbelievable
after only a week of trying it it just
is I get the height again another powder
and this is actually one I've not tried
I haven't even opened it yet cuz I tried
this and said forget everything else I
only want to use this this is the RCM a
no color powder I was frankly just tired
of hearing about it I wanted to buy it
for myself it's not an expensive product
especially considering how much you get
but they do sell it on beauty lish and
so I was like I feel like I should just
own it I don't know how much I'm going
to use it I'm certainly gonna try it and
like I said when I do my update I will
certainly update you on this and we'll
have tried it a lot but it's one of
those that I think supposedly there's no
flash back there's no perfume no filler
like it's it's absolutely like perfect
for that kind of flawless finish but
there's no flashback you know I'm a
little nervous because of my dry skin I
don't love using most loose powders cuz
I feel like it kind of emphasizes that
and I'd rather look a little dewy glowy
then I would mattify so gotta try it let
you know but yeah I know for the longest
time I figured our CMA would be
expensive because so many people talked
about it I don't know and then I looked
up like oh actually that's not bad at
all the next product
I've bought is again from Charlotte
Tilbury it's one of those quads anyone
else seen those videos they kill me they
kill me because it'll be this
unbelievably gorgeous model and her eye
makeup is like perfectly glittery
shimmery I mean it's just so like so
gorgeous and they'll have I don't know
who it is maybe it's Charlotte herself
or maybe it's I don't but they'll have
someone with you know like let's say the
palette and they'll be dipping into the
gold and like put putting it on or maybe
though I think it's a finger they put
their finger on and they like to swipe
it across but you can tell they're not
actually a
eyeing it because it's already applied
but it is the most mesmerizing thing to
watch regardless if you've seen the
video please let me know down below that
I'm not crazy because when I see that
come up with like in my Facebook feed or
anything I'm like and I just like watch
it ten times because it's only like five
seconds long anyway
that's what that is why I freaking
bought this palette that is exactly why
so this is in the vintage vamp it's got
these two gorgeous shimmers these two
kind of plummy pinkish mattes really
they're more like satin I feel like
these are really pretty the glitter the
sorry the gold one does have a little
bit of actual glitter in it and I feel
like it's not as pigmented as you would
think you know what I'm saying and then
the the matte shimmer or sorry the matte
satin ones are nice they blend these
blend nicely they really do I've only
used this one time so this is a true
like haul because I really I can't
really give my opinion but just based on
swatches alone that gold one was very
unimpressive and I thought that would be
the like winner and this palette based
on those videos and I don't remember if
this was like this palette was the one
they were talking about it might have
been like la dolce vita or something
like that anyway it's not even the name
of I'm making things up anyway so I'm
gonna keep trying it the gold when I did
use it what I ended up doing is I tried
it with my finger I'm like okay that
didn't work so I grabbed a brush and did
it and I got a little more and then I
grabbed a brush and use the fix+ in it
it definitely amped it up a lot so it's
possible to make it look nice but I
thought it was kind of interesting that
it was so kind of unpigmented naturally
that was really odd so I would say if
you're like dying to try to Charlotte
Tilbury palette hold off if you trust my
opinion hold off and I will get back to
you on that and see like I mean is it
really worth it or if you have some and
you have a certain quad you like please
let me know like is there one quad out
there that is like absolutely the best
one to own so the next product is from
by terry and again a lot of you guys
recommended this it's there hyaluronic
hydra powder so this stuff is colorless
I mean it looks white but it's trans
and I have used this a couple times I
focused it just here where I said that
you know my foundation typically breaks
apart
I'm not typically using foundation to
mattify it as I mentioned earlier I'm
usually using it just to hold the makeup
in place or to prevent other makeup from
sticking to certain areas so I've
applied this today I applied it with my
sponge and I wasn't baking or anything
like that I just got a little bit and
just kind of pressed it in and it
definitely blurred those areas
definitely now do I think this is like
the ultra perfecting powder not yet I'm
not fully convinced now I did just read
I was just pulling their little info up
for this product and it mentions using
your fingers to just press it in the
areas and I'm intrigued to try it that
way because I'm curious about how the
heat and the warmth of your fingers will
help make that look almost a little more
natural and less drying so I'm
definitely I don't feel like I have a
strong opinion about this either way yet
I do I will say this it definitely looks
nicer when you put it on then some of my
other powders I have so I don't think
this is a bad product I'm just trying to
decide you know is it really worth the
price tag of
what is it $60 or not now I did see that
they sell some mini versions of this I
can link below I think I saw a mini
version for like 12 bucks so if that's
actually still available I will link it
below as well if you're just curious but
as a dry skin gal I was intrigued by
this idea of a Hydra powder so again I
don't feel like it was overly mattifying
but it definitely did mattify I mean
there's no doubt about that but I think
the claims and it are more focused on
the filling the pores kind of a thing in
hyaluronic acid I'm not sure how they
got that stuff into this powder but I do
know that hyaluronic acid and my skin
are like BFFs they get along very well
so I'll keep trying it so those are all
of the wishlist items that I've recently
picked up kind of more luxurious haul if
you liked this video or this style of
video definitely give it a thumbs up so
I know and if you are intrigued to try
Shop Tiger definitely check out my link
and other than that I
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
