okay everyone with Jessica and today I'm
going to share with you guys my new
year's resolutions and this is kind of a
more serious video because as I think
about the new year and all that comes
with it this year I've got so many
things to look forward to a lot of
travel that we've got planned my wedding
in June and just all kinds of things
like that moving into a house with Tyler
once we're married and you know i'm
still in my first year of teaching and
continuing that just all of those things
that are coming in this new year it can
be very overwhelming and very
nerve-wracking so I'm trying to be very
thoughtful at the beginning of this year
and think about what is truly important
to me and what I really do need to work
on to be successful and all that's about
to come my way so that in mind I kind of
brainstormed and came up with three
different things that I think are going
to help me be very successful this year
not monetarily but as a person keeping
myself sane and keeping myself healthy
but mostly just keeping myself happy so
my very first resolution is that I need
to budget my money like for real I used
to be pretty good at I use an app called
mint mint com it's free and you can kind
of budget and it'll can it you can
connect to your bank account and it'll
tell you like okay you're allotting
yourself this much money to budget for
gas and this much money for food and etc
and it'll tell you it'll take the
payments that you're making on your car
and it'll kind of categorize them itself
and it's pretty accurate and it'll say
well you're over budget for groceries
that or whatever and it was pretty
amazing but I kind of fell off that
bandwagon and then I used to kind of
ride it out what my budget was then I
kind of tall off that bandwagon and as I
am looking at my finances I realized
like wow like I don't even know where my
money is going like I'm saving and stuff
like that but I'm not keeping my self
aware of how I am spending my money and
that it's a terrible habit and I know
that that's a terrible habit and
especially going into a wedding a
honeymoon a house all these things that
we need a lot of money for I have got to
be more responsible with it so I really
want to find a way I might go back to
using mint but just budgeting my money
truly deciding okay
this is how much money I'm getting in a
month i'm going to use i have been
estimating and using about this much for
gas so i'm going to budget that much for
gas and this much for makeup because for
that's what's tricky for me because this
is one of my jobs it's almost sounds
ridiculous but it's almost a necessity
to be getting some new makeup products
in now a lot of it you guys know I can
be sent some makeup and stuff but I was
like to buy stuff you know I've go to
the drugstore and I want to try the new
lipstick that's out there and they're
not going to send that to me for free so
um that's something that I know I should
budget it in but I should set a limit so
I know like okay I'm only going to spend
twenty dollars a month to try maybe a
couple new drugstore products things
like that so I'm really excited to a
nervous to truly budget it penny by
penny to see where I stand and I think
it's going to really make a difference
in how much I'm able to save this year
and if you have any budgeting money tips
I would love to see them if you know of
a great app or a great program whatever
please let me know down below because
I'm certainly open for any suggestions
when it comes to that my second
resolution is to learn something new
each day and this I had originally
written down that I wanted to read more
and then I'd also written down that I
want to learn how to do just a bunch of
different things that I didn't know how
to do and I realized that really all of
that could fall undo under a category
like learn something new every day and
so that's where my focus is I want to if
I'm reading more that I'm learning more
if I am watching videos on how to
crochet I'm learning something you know
so there's a lot of ways for me to be
learning something new and I'm you know
we all do learn new things everyday but
I want to actively engage myself in
learning new things so that is a big one
for me that I want to do I want to get
back into dancing because I loved
dancing i'm not the best answer by any
means but it was fun i would love to you
know my gym has free dance classes i
should do that more but dancing is
something that I you know I'm decently
good at and I enjoy it so it's something
I should partake in just because it'd be
good for me and it be me learning more
about different types of dance etc so
just little things like that and my last
resolution is to reflect more and for me
that would also mean pray more but
if you're not religious then it might
mean something very different but
regardless I've talked a lot in past
videos i think i did a video about how
to be happy and different things like
that and i mentioned in that video about
a gratitude journal and I really let
that fall by the wayside especially as I
got busier with my first year of
teaching etc um and I I feel as though I
should reflect more on my day and on
what I've learned maybe and on what I
can improve upon the next day I've been
teaching my students we've been doing
this they each have their own like
reflection journal and I've been trying
to we're not doing it every day I wish
but we've been trying to the last five
or ten minutes of the day we all sit in
journal and I do too in my little
notebook so we all sit and write down
what our successes were that day and
what our goals are for the next day and
in that way we're all my students and I
am thinking about you know what didn't
work very well for me I'm thinking as a
teacher what didn't work very well you
know was I able to manage to class well
that day was I may be too Stern with the
kid that really didn't need me to be
that Stern etc um but also just as a
person I would like to be doing that on
my own time reflecting on what was I
successful at was I nicer to this person
that i really don't like today did I
gossip that's something that I would be
a goal for tomorrow don't gossip etc so
it's such a simple thing to do and it
takes two seconds to write down a two
sentences of a success and a goal but
it's something that you just easily
forget or easily push to the side and I
really want to make it a point to
reflect on that more and also just to
pray more to be thankful for all that
I've been given oh my gosh and I don't
mean just things I mean I've been given
so many family members that love me and
that i love I've been given the gift of
Tyler oh my gosh like I cannot imagine
my life without him just so many things
that I've been blessed with with this
job that I love both teaching and
YouTube I love my two jobs I can't
imagine not teaching and I can't imagine
not doing youtube so i guess for the
rest of my life i'm gonna be doing both
i don't know but i love them both so
much so I'm just thankful and I need to
thank God for that every single day
because I I just would be a different
person without these jobs and I'm so
thankful for that as well so I would
love to know what your resolution
our for this year and I might just add
them to my own resolution list please
let me know down below and if you'd like
please subscribe and I'll catch you guys
very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
