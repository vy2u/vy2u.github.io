going to share with you guys my lipstick
declutter I've done quite a few of these
I swear I just finished up my other
declutter but I filmed it like months
and months before then I just filmed it
all within two days but then I just
uploaded each video kind of separately
over the course of a couple of months
and I'm already at that point again
where at least with my lip drawer which
is that very top drawer there and my
Alex set it's already overflowing now I
will say I know a lot of people are like
stop buying lipstick like please know
that most of the stuff I did not buy in
fact I would say probably five to ten
percent of it I actually purchased most
of it is scent it's we're in that realm
of YouTube where so many companies are
on board with sending different
youtubers lots of different makeup
samples so it's not that I'm going out
and spending a ton of money on it it's
just that that's just kind of the
reality of my job it's an awesome
reality it is so exciting to get these
things please know that I'm not
ungrateful for it I am but you know if
it's a product that I'm just not
interested in or I'm just wasn't
impressed with or whatever or maybe it's
just not my taste then there's no
purpose in me keeping it especially if I
know I'm not planning on using it a
video or doing anything with it and I'm
not going to use it in my real life then
there's definitely no reason for me to
hold on to it I'm not sure if I will be
able to fit all of lipstick and lip
gloss and lip liner in this video we
will see if not I'll film it and put it
in separate videos but there's a lot in
fact there's way more than the last time
I felt at 90 clutters there's way way
way more than I have so let's go ahead
and get into it so here is all of my lip
stuff
my gosh it is a stupid rotten mess oh my
gosh
so I'm excited to pull all of this out
we'll do it by category will do
lipsticks and lip glosses and then lip
liners and then maybe like chapstick
so we'll see if we can fit all this into
this video but let's go ahead and pull
this stuff out of here so we can attack
it this is what we're dealing with here
I'm going to try and reorganize it up
here and we'll just see what we start
with
so you're all of my lip glosses I think
I think I've managed I'm gonna take my
bracelet off because it's just gonna get
clinky my desk by the way if you're
curious is from Holt look I'll link it
below um if I can find it the problem is
whole look is a flash sale site so
things will be on there for a couple
days and then gone but I'll try and
write that I'll definitely link
hautelook but I'll try and find the name
of the desks you can search for because
it has two drawers right here and it's
amazing it's perfect anyway um and I'm
kind of switch it out from my IKEA Alex
one that I had I saw my Niger over there
obviously but alright ah I don't know
where to start the thing is like I
mentioned earlier a lot of these were
sent to me and only a couple of them are
bought so you know I don't ever feel too
bad giving it away but at the same time
if I feel like I haven't given it a fair
shot I feel bad um so let's start over
here I just bought both of these l'oreal
infallible Pro Mod Pro matte glosses
these are incredible um I'll swatch one
of them they're just like whipped cream
on your lips they're so comfortable
I've never honestly I've never tried a
lip product like these I love them so
much and I had tried what is the one
from is it Maybelline like there or
maybe it's Revlon there HD lip color I
hated those but these are amazing
because they're not truly truly mad
there's so kind of glossy but they're
they're awesome so those are definite
keeps I think I'll put my keeps up here
and my get rid ups here we'll see how it
works out in the end cuz I'm gonna run
out of room quickly
these smashed buck ones are really
really similar these are they're always
on ones I used to have the whole range
and I got rid of almost all of them this
one's in babbler this one's in some
demand let's swatch them and see okay
that one what's that one babe alert
I know I've worn that in a video or two
I really liked that one it's a little
brighter obviously than the L'Oreal one
this one's in in demand see those are
very different at least to my on to any
beauty lover you'd see those are
different so I think I'm gonna keep both
of those
I really like that formula I'm kinda I'm
gonna be honest I kind of regret getting
rid of so many of them I wish I would
have kept like one of the red ones that
I had cuz I literally had the entire
line that they had sent me and now
looking back I was in such a declutter
mode but now I'm like man I wish I would
have kept some of them this is a lore'l
extraordinaire whatever in Rose melody I
love this this is similar to the YSL
ones which I have one of those
somewhere here or if I don't that means
it's somewhere else oh here it is I
should add that to my repertoire I'm
keeping this I really really like it
I've did a high-end dupes video with a
ton of products that are like total
dupes for really really expensive
products I'll link that as well and one
of them was this so this YSL one these
are so expensive and this is a total not
shade wise but the it's the same exact
formula so you get any shade you want so
I'm keeping both them because I
genuinely like both of them I'm getting
rid of all three of these even though
yes they are brand new was it driving
anyone that's that those didn't match it
was driving me nuts I didn't realize um
and while I'm at it I have these three
as well so I don't like these like barn
your lips to get them all tingly and
like plumped and I know some people like
those so I think I'm going to save these
three for a giveaway so I'm going to
take them out of my collection because I
know some people really really like
these I've watched some videos some of
youtubers love these I just didn't like
them these three I've already tried so I
think I'm going to get rid of these
three like to a friend or family but
these I'm going to say for sorry we're
dog sitting right now and we've got
beagles playing and barking right now so
if you hear that in the other room
that's what it is so I'm going to save
these for a giveaway and then just
straight-up give these away to friends
and family and co-workers cuz I know
they would like these but these are
unopened totally untouched and you know
lip gloss is something you don't want to
just pass on to a stranger you'd rather
know the person if you're gonna reuse
something so I figure family might like
this so get rid of and get rid of but
then all I'll separately later kind of
differentiate so that's good I didn't
really like them they were really really
Bernie if
well alright moving along this is the
Milani amore matte lipcream these are
incredible I'm definitely keeping this
it's in lust it's just like the sila
ones um oh my gosh they're just it
smells like vanilla it dries down to a
matte you know you do gotta kind of
freshen it up throughout the day but
these are incredible for drugstore they
are the best matte matte liquid lipstick
I found in the drugstore absolutely
period so good I really should get more
colors but frankly I don't even use that
one enough so I figure I don't really
need it now you will see I've kept so
many bare minerals lip glosses oh wait
hold on that one is Revlon this one's a
Revlon Super Lustrous in Supernatural
and I really like that one it's just a
really normal honestly this would be one
that I should just take to work cuz I do
love this so much but I don't wear it a
ton when it's with all of this so I feel
like I should leave it at work because I
would wear this every day if it were at
work with me so let me know if you'd be
interested in like a makeup bag at work
kind of thing because I do have one and
I need to refresh it cuz some of them
are old and I haven't like brought new
stuff but if you'd be interested in
seeing the makeup that I keep it work to
touch-up let me know I'm a teacher so
it's rare that I actually get to touch
up but I do sometimes so these are all
bare minerals lip glosses now they sent
me this entire range and they're liquid
lipstick entire range and they're like a
lip actual just regular Gen nude
lipsticks which I'll show you in a
little bit or in the other video
depending um so I've I have a lot of
them so I really don't feel like I need
to keep all of them so let's just watch
them all let's just see this one's in
fancy I don't think I'll wear that one
often so I think that's when I can
easily get rid of this one's in
forbidden that one's actually really
pretty I might keep that one I'm going
to tell you right now this one's
definitely to light this one's in far
out you might as well swatch it I guess
while we're at it but yeah oh my gosh
Wow
that'd be great for like maybe Halloween
or if you really like that blanked out
lip look this one's in totally
that one's pretty too that reminds me of
blushing Belle reves from Rimmel so I
think I'm going to keep that one it's
kind of different to this one I might
not keep its in heartbreaker I mean it's
really pretty but I don't I mean I've
got plenty of glosses that do that
clearly and this is it's just an OK
formula so I'll pass that one this one's
in popular everywhere in this in a video
before kind of more peachy but you know
what I think I'm gonna pass it because
it is a little bit light peachy and it's
not totally my cup of tea so pass that
one on this one's in flirt ooh that is
pretty though that's a really pretty
like kind of fall I'm gonna think about
that one I'm gonna leave that with it
this one has some glitter in it and it's
it's in snarky it's fine I mean it's a
pretty color do I really need another
one that color probably not so I think
I'll pass that on and then this one is
in fly this might be too too light to
Brown I kind of like it though and I
didn't really keep any of the other
peachy ones this is like a peachy Brown
so I think I will keep this so I'm going
to give these four I mean honestly I
don't need all four and these you know
what these are really similar are they
oh it's these two I still want to keep
them so I think I'm gonna keep all four
of these and if I get to the end and I
feel like I'm keeping away too much that
would be an easy place to kind of start
downsizing alright I've got a clean
slate let's keep going this I just
recently got from an elf event in New
York it's their high shine liquid
lipstick in bitten pink I've worn this
quite a few times it's got a doe foot
applicator but it has like this little
like pocket in it that kind of holds
onto the color it's a really pretty lip
gloss and a really pretty color this is
one that doesn't get enough hype I
really like this formula a lot so I'm
definitely keeping this um oh my gosh
this is their ELF pal Perfector it's a
brush which I don't love but it's like
the most unbelievable color you've ever
isn't that the most
whole thing ever so I'm definitely this
is one of those amazing things if you
just want that pop the pout Perfector
name is perfect for this it really adds
that so that is a definite cake for me
this is their elf hyper shine lip gloss
in vixen these just get so messy and I
think this color is just a little too I
don't know like almost a little too
bright for me okay so I actually just
tried this on my lips and I actually
really liked it and that is rare because
I've tried a million reddish strawberry
like lip glosses and I never liked them
because I like matte red lipstick if I'm
lipstick if I'm going to do that but I
actually really like the way this looks
it won't look cute like in the fall or
winter I don't think but in the spring
and summer it looks like popsicle lips
in a really good way if that makes any
sense to you so I'm actually going to
keep this that kind of surprised me this
is from nuance my Salma Hayek eye there
PR company recently sent me a bunch of
stuff I've actually never even charted
so let's open this bad boy and see how
it is I'd love to do I've got enough
products I could do like a nuance you
know best and worst this is their true
color plumping liquid lipstick so it's
plumping oh so it really is more gloss
like you can see how like transparent it
is you know um kind of like that elf lip
gloss in a way I really actually like
this too
again it's very holiday II and at the
time I'm filming this you know I'm kind
of in that holiday mood so for me I'm
like oh I really like it so hmm I might
keep it for now and give it a try and
see you know because this is a newer
brand new formula to me this is the Too
Faced melted liquefied lipstick I like
these this is the only shade I've kept
over the years it's a really pretty
color it's in the shade melted Chihuahua
it clearly gets incredibly messy which
is too bad because I like my makeup to
stay really clean but it's such a pretty
color I can't get rid of it and this is
one of those things that you know as I
look for dupes for dupe videos I would
use this as a
reference so yes I'm going to keep that
though these I just recently bought I'm
going to keep however these I realized
in my drugstore haul where I bought
these and I can link that below as well
that I didn't know these are all from
Rimmel right here these four and this is
just a repackaged version of their stay
glossy lip glosses here and they now
call it oh my gloss so these are both
right here they're both in the shade
non-stop glamour and I swatch them both
in the video and they are totally the
same this one might be a little peachy
herb I like a tiny hair
but since this one is much older I'm
going to go ahead and keep this one and
get rid of my state glossy here just
because it is older and that one's I'm
probably just going to trash but I will
keep this one and I like the pink one
here as well and this one is blushing
Belle graves is one of my favorite just
this perfect like as I always describe
it gray pink color it's milky but
perfect and not too light it is the most
amazing drugstore lipgloss I've ever
tried I love it so I'm keeping those and
that moving along I've got some new
products to my life this one's the Kat
Von D liquefied lipstick and or liquid
lipstick whatever she calls it
everlasting liquid lipstick and outlaw
this is this unreal red color I cannot
wait to wear it for the holidays I love
red lips I wear them a decent amount and
I just like up so I'm always looking for
something super long-lasting so I'm
definitely keeping that let's compare
that to this DLS matte lipstick this I
got like in a subscription box this
one's just so much more orange I don't
love it so I think I'm gonna get rid of
this one it seems like a decent format
it's really thin but it's really orange
and I don't love that on me I would much
prefer a more red version so I'm gonna
go and get rid of that one even though
the packaging could not be cuter
speaking of liquid lipstick this is the
cielo stay all day in patina this one
reminds me so much of the Milani one but
I love both so I'm going to keep both
for now but oh my gosh it's so good it's
so pretty if you like that blue tone
Mavi pink but those are it's an
incredible formula this is one of my
favorite lip glosses of all time top 5
this is the
mega shine lip gloss beige it's the only
tip NYX let me look through yeah it is
the only NYX lip gloss I own just a
light pink pretty but it actually looks
good on your lips like I feel like I've
had so many light pink ones that just
look weird
this one just blends in it looks
beautiful um so this is from another
subscription box I think this is from
Moya and it's a lip gloss in the shade
Malbec which is my favorite kind of wine
it's kind of a more sheer pink let me
try it on my lips okay no I tried it on
my lips it looks crazy I just don't look
good in these fuchsia glosses I can
sometimes wear fuchsia lipsticks but in
gloss it just looks terrible on me so I
am gonna get rid of that even though
it's so nice alright moving along we've
got this we've got this Catrice infinite
shine lip gloss that they sent it's in
the shade Rose would you oh my gosh see
I haven't even tried this on my lips yet
that is gorgeous
oh I love that and it's so milky
actually my gosh where is it it reminds
me of blushing Belle graves Oh No
blushing go here is a little bit lighter
but those are both so pretty
so keeping both of those I see I want to
put that in my purse now that is awesome
umm this is the color plop I do that
everytime
colour-pop ultra matte lip color plop
and what color used to have a couple of
these in bad habit but I got rid of all
but this one
look how amazing isn't that just unreal
I need to wear this so soon I should
have worn that today oh I love it
it's just that beautiful berry so
perfect for fall if you're looking for
that just right very color this is it
bad habit by color plop and kidding
color pop these are all three from jcat
they sent and it's their lip finiti
matte lip I don't think I'm going to
keep any of them like this pink for
example I am never gonna wear that color
pink like please that would look
ridiculous on me so that's an easy one
to get rid of
let's try the peach I think if I
remember right when I was watching these
it looked like a kind of cheesy peach
I'll make sure I know my lips okay so as
I put this on my lips it just feels
really cheap it genuinely does now
either at plenty of like the Milani one
is just as cheap if not cheaper but it
feels luxurious this one just feels
cheap even going on my lips and just dry
and gross so let me at least what I'm
gonna get rid of that peach one let me
at least swatch this one so pretty but
again it just has that cheap feel where
it just instantly feels like it's
drawing out my lips not in a good way
how would that ever be in a good way so
I just gotta get rid of these I'm sorry
JK all right so this one's from gerard
cosmetics i think i got this with like
hypsi points like it was free if you use
your points it's in the shade nude I've
never tried a new these it really is a
pretty color and since it's the only one
I have and I have no reference point I
think I want to keep it alright so next
up is this lip gloss in well as CR o 6
it's from Missha beauty and it's their
glam art gloss signature I loved this
I've mentioned it in some recent video I
don't know but it's the most perfect
peach just comfortable to wear beautiful
and beautiful packaging so I'm
definitely keeping that geez I'm not
even here not that much Marc Jacobs I
love this stuff it's their lip gloss in
moon glow and it's their enamored high
shine lip lacquer it's just this
beautiful just milky lip gloss I love it
so much I'm definitely keeping that this
flower beauty I'm not gonna open it I'm
gonna save it for a giveaway cuz for me
it's a really dear the flower lip
glosses are really nice formulas I've
tried this but not but in a different
shade but they the smell is too
overbearing for me and I know some
people that love it it's kind of more of
a floral so you know one of you guys
might like it but I just don't so I
don't even want to open it and waste
that I'm going to save it for a some
kind of giveaway soon this is the pure
lip leur hydrating lip lacquer in mystic
I've had quite a few of these this one's
more of a berry tone and it is really
pretty but honestly I'm
we're going to use it I just don't use
this style so I'm going to get rid of it
this is the Sephora cream lip stain in
0-6 I love this it's just like the seal
one to be quite candid with you I just
put that on top of the lip gloss but I
love it it's totally worth buying if
you're at Sephora I love that this is a
Mac retro matte liquid lip color into
matte with love it's just like a matte
bright pink but it's not like a baby
pink I love that it's like a bright rose
and I'm oh my gosh it's so beautiful so
I'm definitely keeping that this is an
over liquid lipstick in mocha the only
Ofra one I own and I actually I don't
think I own anything that deep it is it
ol boy I just got it everywhere Kris um
it is a deeper color and I don't think I
really own anything that's a liquid
lipstick this color so I am going to
keep that the formulas are right um it
kind of like the oils kind of separating
from which kind of weird and I just got
it so that's a little bizarre but um and
then this is an Estee Lauder lip gloss
it's really nice but honestly I have not
reached for it in a couple months since
I got it I'm just gonna get rid of it
cuz I know one of my sisters will
actually use it and I don't want it to
just waste away in my collection so
these are all the ones I'm keeping this
is what I'm getting rid of as I kind of
comb through I want to see if there's
anything else I think oh you know what
let me just get rid of that anyway um I
mean honestly I could probably get rid
of this their minerals one in fly I
don't really need it so I mean it is
what it is I still got rid of a nice
chunk I still have a lot again you guys
know I declutter all the time so we'll
see as I start paring down if there's
more I want to get rid of but so far
these are all products I either really
really love or the ones I really want to
try more often so as of now that's all
I'm gonna do for lip glosses if you're
interested in my other declutter videos
that I've done tons and tons I've got an
entire very very long playlist of them I
will link it below if you're just in one
of those moods and you feel like being
spot inspired to declutter your makeup

will link it below I've also used the
con Mari method of decluttering and I've
done that with like all of my clothes
