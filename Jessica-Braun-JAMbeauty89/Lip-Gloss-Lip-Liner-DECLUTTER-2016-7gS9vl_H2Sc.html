glosses and my lip liners so let me go
ahead and organize them so these are all
of my lip glosses but I also honestly
it's like lip glosses in the back these
are like either liquid lipstick type
products or just lip color products that
I'm now realizing I probably should have
done in the lipstick video but oh well
here we are so and then we'll do the
liners afterwards let's start up here
these are both very similar products
this one's from YSL and it's their Rouge
pore Couture lip product in number 19
and it's just like a kind of a weird
gloss but I actually really like it it's
such an easy thing to throw on it kind
of soaks into your lips and it just
feels comfortable this is similar but
it's by L'Oreal and it's there well I
don't know what it is but it's in the
shade 101 Rose melody similar packaging
a little bit different of a formula but
pretty similar
I actually really like both of these
they're a little bit different of colors
so I don't think I'm gonna get rid of
either one they're kind of ones I grab
for when I'm in a rush and I just need
something for my lips I grab one of
these this is the Revlon Super Lustrous
lip gloss in super natural and it's just
a perfect just normal kind of mauve lip
gloss it's just the perfect one so I
love that this one is from passport to
beauty and it's their gipset err
luminous lips and this is one I've tried
it on my lips a couple times it is
shimmery and I just don't love it she's
kind of a goopy sticky formula I think
the shade is bohemian glow it's okay but
it's just really sticky and I don't like
that so I'm gonna pass this one on so
keep get rid of this is by the grand
brand lip gloss
and it's in the shade zero six seven
solar flare they'd actually sent me a
lot of these but I already decluttered
them but I kept the shade I thought I
might like and this one's okay but it
has this really really bad plasticky
smell and I hate to say that but I it's
like a bad plastic smell really bad I
can't handle on my lips definitely going
away this is an it cosmetics lab sample
they sent in something and it's there
it's their vitality butter gloss and
news anchor blue and it's just kind of a
clear gloss but it does have a blue tint
and they say that makes your teeth look
whiter I don't know I put it on my lips
and I didn't really notice the
difference so I think I'm gonna pass
this on these are my two Rimmel stay
glossy lip glosses I love them so much
they're not sticky they're just perfect
my favorite is blushing Belle graves I
always describe it as a grayish pink
because that's what I think it is it's
so milky and pretty this is the one in
peach well it's a peach color it's
called non-stop glamour I also love this
it's just a really pretty shimmery peach
but again they're not sticky and I think
that's so amazing so I highly recommend
those from the drugstore one of my other
favorite lip glosses by NYX it's called
beige and it's just a really pretty pink
and it actually just looks nice on the
lips it does have a cherry scent though
now I've got a couple here that are like
sample size this is the bare minerals
marvelous Moxie in rebel or rebel it
kind of feels sticky to be like it's
hard to get it on so I think I'm gonna
pass this one on I certainly don't need
any more this is a buxom one I love
books and polishes so I probably will
keep this and I just got rid of the one
I had it was just about gone this is in
the shade dolly wow it is a truly tiny
size but these make your lips tingle in
the best way if you like that and I just
love them so I so tiny
I think I'll keep it just try and use it
up now onto these bad boys over here so
these are all liquid lipsticks this is
kind of an in-between weird thing and
then these are just totally different so
let's do these first this is a Mac retro
matte liquid lip color in two matte with
love matte like it made TTE and it's
this amazing formula it's so soft I mean
do you guys see that it really is
incredible so I'm definitely keeping
this for when I do want to wear a bright
pink it dries down it stays put this is
a colour-pop ultra matte lip in bad
habit and this one is my doggy is
yawning a little bit deeper it'd be a
really good fall color and I actually
got rid of my other color pop ones and
just kept this one but so far those are
different I'm going to compare and only
keep ones that I really need to this is
the Stila stay all day liquid lipstick
in patina it's a really famous color
very nice these all smell like vanilla
by the way I think literally all of them
do this is a drugstore one though it's
by Milani it's their amour a matte lip
cream and this one's in lust and I kind
of listed this as a dupe for the Sela
one because I really do feel like it is
a dupe for the Stila one but I actually
think that I like the Milani one better
than the Stila I think it's a little bit
more comfortable and the shade is just a
little bit more rosy than the other one
it's a little more warm toned so I think
I'm actually gonna get rid of the Stila
one and keep the Milani one crazy right
yeah and then this is the Too Faced
melted lick liquid lipstick in melted
Chihuahua I've only used it like once I
don't like these applicators I think
that's what kills me more than anything
it's kind of that brown tone there I
don't know do I really need it I don't
know that I'm gonna ever use it so I
think I'm gonna pass it on I'd rather
just wear lipstick that color than
something like this so I think I am
gonna get rid of that
these I'm getting rid of both they're
these Revlon Ultra HD matte lip colors
this one's in the shade devotion and
it's it's an okay but it kind of sheers
out so I don't really know what it's
about that's why I was saying it's kind
of like a mixture of things this one's
in the shade addiction and it's supposed
to be deeper and you'd have to put a lot
of layers on to make sure it's totally
not see-through does that make sense
I don't think they're terrible but I
kind of think they're terrible like if
they're gonna kind of market it
themselves as something comparable to
these I feel like they need to be a
little bit more pigmented not a sheer
again you can build them up but I'm like
you know the Milani one is way way
better for the same price so I'm
definitely getting rid of both of those
these are kind of new to me so this is
the maybelline color blur and this one
said I'm blushing I love this color so
much I've used this a lot since I bought
it
just a really simple kind of thin but
really pigmented comfortable thing to
wear this one's in the shade Berry
misbehaved and it's much more berry
toned color they're all really pretty I
think I'm gonna keep both cuz I really
do like this formula I was so impressed
with these so I'm gonna keep those so I
don't think that's too bad I'm getting
rid of these I'm keeping these that's
really not bad compared to where I was
like a year or two ago so and you know
what now that I'm looking at this I
think I'm gonna get rid of the buck
someone just because it's so tiny I know
out of what I already have I'm probably
not gonna reach for this much just cuz
it's I kind of almost feel like why even
bother I don't know I know that's
terrible of me to say but someone else
will probably actually really use this
and enjoy it so that's that let's go
through my lip liners now I'm just gonna
kind of set them out again I've got this
if you saw my lip stick declutter I've
got all of these Urban Decay lipsticks
they also sent me a bunch of their lip
liners so I haven't done a swatch video
of these yet I don't know that I will of
the liner so to be honest with you so
let me go through what I already have
and then I'll go through those so this
is this
our looks hearts boxycharm charmed
pencil lip pencil and I actually really
like this shade oh that just broke off
oh boy
kind of feeling drier than it was like a
month ago when I first got it but I like
the shade but I'm gonna think about that
one because that's kind of dry I'm
thinking maybe I shouldn't even mess
with it this is one of my favorite star
Lux products no this is my favorite star
Lux product of all time it's their
infinity lip pencil and it's in Terry's
choice and it's this amazing berry color
oh my gosh I just love it so much so
definitely keeping that getting rid of
this so let me I'm just gonna get rid of
that keep that this is by Kiko Milano
I've got two this one's in 302 and it's
their creamy color lip liner and yeah I
like that way better than the starlooks
one so I'm going to keep that this one
is in 312 and it's much more pink but
it's kind of this one's kind of like
sheer so I think I'm gonna get rid of
this one the other one was not very
sheer but this one's kind of coming
through a little bit sheer which is not
what I wanted a lip liner so I'm gonna
pass that one on this one is the Mac Pro
Longwear lip pencil and staunchly
stylish and it's again a peach I need to
sharpen it a deeper peach tone actually
it more of a deeper almost Brown but I
don't really have anything like it so
I'm definitely keeping that one this is
the colour-pop lippie pencil in bound
there whoa I need to clean that up and
sharpen it this is actually kind of
similar to the Mac no it's not it's
actually a lot more mauve their lip B
pencils really are amazing but I need to
sharpen it so I'm definitely keeping
that so keeping for getting rid of two
out of the ones I already had now we've
got these first of all I have this Urban
Decay 24/7 one here
well they're all Urban Decay 24/7 sorry
I need to stretch my legs out this is in
the shade mrs. Mia Wallace
I love the formula of these they are
incredible but this is one you can't get
any more so I don't like to use it so I
think I'm gonna get rid of it because I
see that there might be some other red
options here I can keep that you'd be
able to still purchase
this red one is called 7:14 it's meant
to correspond with their 714 lipstick
and it's like kind of an orange tone red
and I don't have anything like that in
what I'm keeping so far so I'm gonna
keep that one this one's in the shade
naked
it is very nude like way that's I have
more pigmented lips that's not gonna
work so I think sadly I'm gonna get rid
of that one this one is in the shade -
and it's more of a like oxblood red I
don't like that shade on me so I'm gonna
pass it on this one's in hex and it's
more of a de berry wow I'm gonna think
about that one that's gonna go in the
thinking pile this one's in jilted and
it looks like a bright pink but again it
looks exactly like that
Kiko one where it's kind of almost sheer
yeah it really reminds me of this Kiko
one where it's kind of more sheared out
I don't know that I like that let's try
this pink one as well this one's in
anarchy and it yeah that's like a much
well it's certainly really bright but
it's not sheer at all which I want this
is a purple one and pandemonium it's
interesting but I will pass it on this
one is in conspiracy which is meant to
go with their conspiracy it's literally
brown so if you like that I know a lot
of people that actually looks really
nice with your skin tone this one is
that one in hex isn't it hex really is
different I'm kind of thinking about
keeping it just because I don't have
anything like it and if I did have a
really really deep lipstick I might
actually want that to at least have as
an option so I might keep it we'll see
if I don't ever use it then I'll know
okay it's time to get rid of it and that
makes me think I might keep this purple
one just because I've never seen one
like this and if I did find a purple
lipstick I genuinely wanted to wear I
don't know that that's gonna happen I
think I want to hold on to it for just a
little bit
longer to make sure and then again if I
never ever use it then I know I'm gonna
get rid of it but that's kind of where
I'm at right now so I'm keeping one two
three four five six seven eight
lipliners I'm getting rid of two four
six seven so getting rid of those
they're keeping these not too bad and
again some of these might eventually go
anyway but not bad so these are all the
ones I'm keeping and this is what I'm
getting rid of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
