informal old-school Jessie video because
I feel like I'm in a new house and I'm
so excited and so thankful for where not
only my teaching job but my youtube job
has taken me and we are so blessed and
so the other day I was watching I met to
get emotional I was watching some of my
older videos and I was oh I'm like
genuinely crying but I was watching some
of my older videos and I realized like
pan like I used to just sit on the floor
and talk to you guys and I feel like I'm
still honest with you guys and I still
talk to you guys but I mean things
change and I've gotten older I've
matured a bit I've learned more I've got
different equipment so I used to film on
my phone look at my red nose from cut
low my nose is always red anyway I just
feel like I missed that part and so gosh
yes um that's what I wanted to do today
today I'm doing an old-school declutter
I'm gonna I'm literally sitting on my
floor right now in my jammie-jams and I
put a little bit of makeup on not really
clearly cuz it's not covering I just put
like powder on like a little bit of
liner eye shadow brows anyway but I'm
kind of feeling overwhelmed on my floor
I'm trying to organize my collection
I've actually already organized most of
it but as I'm looking at my lip
collection I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed
and so I figured I would take you along
with going through it maybe getting rid
of some stuff and yeah it's all gonna be
filmed on my iPhone like I used to
that's not forever but just for this
video and all of my like camera
equipment is back in that closet still
packed so I haven't even tackled that
yet this could be a very long video so
just stay tuned but I just kind of feel
like I'm trapped in this place between I
need to get rid of things but also I
just declutter but I've also gotten a
lot of packages in the mail that I had
just packed for awhile and I finally
opened them and I have a lot to go
through so there will be some
collections that I'm going to keep the
entire collection because I'm planning
to do a video about it and that's where
I guess I feel stressed out because I
get in that mood where I just want to
get rid of stuff but then I know I need
to be patient and I
do that in the video so that might make
no sense to some of you guys it might
make perfect sense of some of you guys
it is what it is anyway so let me show
you what I'm working with okay so here's
what I'm working with I've got
everything somewhat organized on the
floor now I have not even pulled out my
well let me go get it and show you well
first of all I've got like new
collections of things that I haven't
even tried out as of the time I'm
filming this video I don't know when
it's going up so with that in mind there
are some things I'm not going to be
putting in there I have like these
Maybelline things other things I don't
know so some of them might not
necessarily get moved into it because I
want to try them out soon soon but if I
go over here oh my gosh this is full of
Avon lipsticks these NYX just sent over
like all this is amazing but I want to
be able to try them all so it's like
they're soft matte lip creams I know the
dark all kinds of things so I don't
think I'm gonna tackle these today
because again I'm I don't know that i
would do a lip swatch video of all those
that would take forever but I want to
like be able to take my time trying
those out but over here I've got this
from Mac I showed on my snapchat a while
ago and I let me get it open here and
it's amazing and what I said on my
snapchat is holy moly
that is awesome but I'm not the biggest
fan of a lot of the MAC lipsticks like
their formula now there are some that I
tried that I do like I feel like for me
it's just hit or miss my lips are
naturally kind of dry so I feel like if
you have naturally really healthy lips
you probably won't have an issue but
they sent me tons of them and then a
bunch of their liners and these and then
what I'm most excited because I really
like their lip glasses so this was
amazing I was so freaking excited I
actually broke the box I was so excited
oh well anyway so I want to figure out
what I want to do with this so until
then I don't think I want to get rid of
a now I know I'm going to declutter a
lot of these and by declutter I mean
either
if I didn't swatch it at all I might do
just a giveaway with a bunch of them I
think that would be awesome
but if I did swatch it I might like give
it to sisters things like that so we
will see I don't think I'm gonna do a
swatch video of all those that would be
insane though some more collections I
was sent a while ago where these Urban
Decay vice lipsticks I haven't even
opened them and this Revlon scent over
there like metallic things here and
these what do they call them Street chic
ones I don't want to get rid of them
without trying them especially since
they're a brand new line Rimmel sent
over some of them so I guess what I'm
saying is this will be a declutter of
what I already have and maybe some of
that stuff I'm just so torn right now I
haven't worn this in quite a while it's
going very excited about this new buxom
one so I'm going to keep that one
these elf wands I don't need all of them
I do really like them but I'm just gonna
pick one I'm gonna keep this nude kiss
yes Jessica let's go girl NYX beige is
an old favorite of mine I really do like
it I'm gonna keep that one the elf
powder fector I got like at an event
like one of the two events I've ever
gone to and I keep saying oh I like it
I'm gonna use it well guess what I've
never used it goodbye
this Grande lips it's pretty good I'd
never use it it's going Marc Jacobs
cream what is it actually called
Moonglow I really do like that one's
gonna say um the two-faced peach maybe
just keep one of them I don't really
need both I clearly don't know what to
do with these by terry wands and so
they're gonna go oh my gosh this feels
so good
okay to face sweet peach ones mmm I kind
of I'm tempted to keep this fun one like
this peachy one and maybe pass on this
one
maybe that's what I'll do um this
moisture lock was good it's just gotten
really old this why I saw one does it
have like a date I've had this for what
does that say twelve months well I've
had this for years I'm in a bath set on
this glossy ages clear gloss I just
recently got so I do want to try that
alright so
far my giveaway pile is bigger than the
keep that is good
this flower one I like so I'm gonna keep
that Charlotte Tilbury definitely
keeping the pull-ups put pillar oh my
gosh that's on my grandma I used to say
it
hello plump from the bomb nope from soap
&amp;amp; Glory I like it the smell kind of
makes me feel nauseous so I'm gonna pass
it on I'm gonna keep this it's the
Amanda Steele and colour-pop ultra
glossy lip that could be my one like
glittery lip gloss how about that
alright umm I think I will keep these
and do a lip swatch video maybe I'll do
one incorporated with that as well but
I'm not gonna necessarily put those in
there cuz I'm gonna reserve that for lip
glosses like I know that I like so with
that in mind I'm just gonna move those
to the side with those let me pull these
up alright these are these urban decay
ones they're metallized but this one's a
cream looks pretty so I just watched
these three here
this one's fuel there on the left the
middle one was heat and that one is
scorched so they're pretty I'm gonna
keep them I'm I would definitely keep
this first one fuel anyway cuz I like
that shade I'm gonna keep them right now
because I want to do a naked heat
tutorial or really just review of these
and the palette so stay tuned for that
but again that's not gonna necessarily
go in my lipstick thing here I'm gonna
wait until I've done that video and
decide if I genuinely want to keep them
the vise palettes or the vise ones same
thing alright now we're getting into the
nitty-gritty cuz last time my very
recent declutter before I moved it was
what a month and a half ago give or take
I was getting rid of some things before
I moved and a lot of that was lip
products but I want to be even more
cutthroat this time so it's kind of like
round 2 ding ding all right out of these
I really like nude star and then the
other ones in my purse spicy blush so
the other ones are going to go away out
of these two I don't need both I think
at the last one I decided to keep both
I'm just gonna keep one I'm gonna keep
the more peachy one get rid
the other one out of these I've had some
of these for quite some time
I like the Barry misbehaving and I like
I like to mob it darn it I like all of
these maybe I will keep these for now
but Jessica you don't wear them be
honest with yourself
I used to wear these all the time I
don't wear them now but I want to keep
one because I really do maybe I'll keep
the Barry misbehaving pass on the other
tuner um all right I love this
Neutrogena stick I love this Burt's Bees
lip I wear all three of these all that
these are like purse lipsticks like I
wear those all the time so keeping all
of those together this glossier one and
this Clinique one I never wear this
clinic one I'm just gonna pass it on
this glossier one I just got it's in the
shade cake so I'm gonna keep that these
Smashbox ones again they're very very
similar
there's in demand and babe alert I think
I'm gonna do babe alert and get rid of
in demand these NARS ones I really
really like I'm keeping um oh my gosh I
never wear this Sephora cream lip stain
this NYX epic ink was horrible it just
wore off terribly on my lips
these Rimmel ones I should probably just
keep one I don't need all of them
although I was wanting to do but again
it I was wanting to do a Rimmel like
like review a bunch of products or
something but I guess I only need one of
these to be able do that and I think I'm
gonna keep this one it's called berry
seductive I'm gonna keep that one get
rid of the other two already feeling it
betta um these do boshy ones I really
like I want to keep trying for a little
while longer to decide before I just get
rid of them I have to keep this Kat Von
D one for reference so many so many of
you guys asked about it and I like to be
able to compare it to other things I
spent the money on it so it's not my
favorite my husband sexy me it's not my
favorite but I want to keep it for
reference I spent the money on it so
these liquid cat suits um I think I want
to keep these for now again this is a
reference point these are really big
right now and since
I bought them I want to be able to
reference them for a little while longer
all right
these Mac ones I think I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid of these I've got many
more to go through and I never reach for
these anyway the bomb ones I never reach
for these again I think I might keep one
for reference so maybe I'll keep this
maybe I'll keep the red one but I don't
use them I want to be able to reference
at least the formula so I'll keep one
same with these I don't need both I
think I'll keep the nude one get rid of
the pink one oh four ones these are my
favorite liquid lipstick formula but I
never ever wear liquid lipsticks any
more I just don't
so again I would like to do like an all
Reds video like Battle of the red liquid
lipsticks wouldn't that be kind of fun
maybe I should keep this Rimmel red one
that that's not red where's the red one
Oh like it oh yeah it is
maybe I should do like a battle of the
red liquid lipsticks I feel like that
would actually be really fun anyway so
with that in mind I think I will keep
those then maybe I'll get rid of the
Barry Ramo one so there we go now out of
these I don't have any brownie nude ones
so I think I do want to keep that these
are like literally the same color
oh they literally are it's to Santa Anas
how did I not know that that's more
embarrassing than anything I think I'll
keep the pink and then get rid of those
all right that's not bad I have all of
my lip sense here these I need there's
like a matte topper a clear topper blah
blah blah I'm gonna keep all these for
reference I think I did get rid of one
at some point but I did a video on these
if you're interested but they're just an
interesting product I know a lot of
people don't like them a lot of people
don't like the company I was pretty
impressed now does it look perfect at
the end of the day no but does it last
longer than like anything I've ever
tried yes
so it's just an interesting product so
I'm gonna keep those alright these
Burberry ones I haven't even tried they
sent to me before I moved and
literally I think maybe i've swatched
them so i want to keep that for now
these hourglass ones I really do like
but I certainly don't need all of them
so let me swatch them ok so the first
one on the left is influencer the next
red one is innovator and then believers
in the middle and then we've got
inventor is the kind of mid tone pink
and the last one is dreamer I'm gonna
keep all of these I just really like
these and I love this formula so I had
the entire collection at one point and I
narrowed it down to these five and
they're just my favorite so so far I am
keeping all of these I'm getting rid of
that pile and this pile and so let me go
ahead and organize these into it and
then we'll move on to some lipsticks all
right let's start with the things I know
that I love and want to keep so my Marc
Jacobs ones I love all three of these
these always say cuz they're one of my
favorite formulas this Avon one I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of I never
ever use this Rimmel one is the only one
I kept because I like the shade so I'm
gonna keep it for now this bourgeois one
I never ever use this Dior one I just
recently got so I want to use more this
least wat TA one I wish I used a lovely
subscriber Senate but I never ever use
let me think about that one these bite
Beauty ones I've got beetroot and fig I
really like those I've got a lot this
NARS one and Raquel is one of my
favorites the Charlotte Tilbury one I
like a lot these urban decay ones I keep
keeping and I never ever use do I just
pass them on I'm just gonna pass them on
I never use them I keep thinking like oh
I should keep them they're beautiful but
guess what it doesn't matter I'm not
reaching form so why hold onto it and
let it get worse and worse and worse I
have these number seven ones I haven't
really even used those so and I am
planning like a number seven entire
brand review like best and worst of the
brand I really
their lipsticks this is also number
seven both of these so I want to try
these more before I get rid of them
these elf wands is the lip exfoliator I
do like but I want to put with my lip
balms this is their velvet matte
lipstick it's pretty good um this do you
want she won this Laura Mercier won
I never use these I'm just gonna pass
them on there good there's nothing wrong
with them but I I just don't need them
same with this Mac one I never use it
this Edward Bess was the one I used on
my wedding so I'm keeping I never used
this bareMinerals one so sad I'm just
gonna pass on the leaf swathi a one I
have all these MAC lipsticks but we all
know that I've got a lot more to go
through eventually patisserie is one of
my favorites this is the lolli and
where's the other one that's the Gabriel
Zamora one I'll keep these for now I
really haven't tried them much so this
is we've got velvet teddy Ruby woo
disobedient and blankety disobedient I'm
gonna pass on I'm gonna pass on velvet
teddy
just cuz I'm cover using it I think I
remember liking blankety and Ruby would
want to keep as well
no Ruby whoo I'm gonna pass on because I
remember it dry my lips not like crazy
um okay that's not bad let me go ahead
and go through these Rimmel ones I'm
gonna get rid of all of these I haven't
opened them I don't need any more lip
products and I don't have a desire to
use or review them and I've gotten like
no requests so I'm just gonna pass these
on let someone enjoy them while they're
brand new you know what I'm just gonna
go through these I'm not gonna wear the
blue I'm not gonna wear the purple I'm
not gonna wear the grey I think what
I'll keep is I think I'll keep these
five so at least those three I can go
ahead and pass on I think I'm just gonna
get rid of all of these but the fuel one
these
chic denim ones I'm gonna get rid of the
lilac the midnight the vah vah violet
those are colors that I know someone
would rock but it won't be me I'm gonna
get rid of this like light gold one the
brown one let's see these two look so
I'm gonna get rid of that one about to
read so I really need to read that's
pink I'll get rid of the pink bombshell
red I think those are all different
enough to keep so I'm gonna keep those
that's better that's better already
um what about these Rimmel ones uh I'm
gonna keep the red in the berry house
those two one
okay I don't need this Pacifica thing
I've got so many mineral sunscreen
mineral everything lip balms I do not
need another one for sure someone else
can enjoy it new let's try these I know
I don't think I'm gonna do a lip swatch
video on these I've had no requests so
that makes me feel like you guys are
interested they're all pink and I don't
I don't know like I don't want to swatch
all of these when someone could enjoy
them as they are so let me just trust
the swatch that's on here let me see see
what I mean like these are insanely
similar so some of them are sheer some
of them are mega Matt I know the mega
mattes I do not like their way I don't
like the metal eyes or the mega matte so
that those can go I think I want to keep
jilted I remember someone on YouTube
loving this shade and I'm intrigued by
it so I'm gonna keep that one really any
of these Matt's I don't want I'm just so
done with Matt's there are two shears
and a couple of creams I want to swatch
one of the shears okay so i swatched
phone call and it's sheer
but not in a way that I think looks like
flattering on me so I'm gonna get rid of
the two shears this is good
so jilted I know I'm keeping and maybe
I'll keep another cream PDA is gonna be
way too light I won't like that what's
the difference that's more of like a fun
purpley maybe I'll keep those two good
job Jessica I'm very proud that was hard
to do because these are nice lipsticks
there I mean this is amazing that
they're sending me this that has not
been lost on me in the few years I've
been doing YouTube this is amazing this
is amazing it's just I know that it's
not right for me to keep all of these
unopened ones when I know in my heart
that I'm just not gonna use them okay so
lip gloss no not gloss this lip balms I
love my glossy a ones I love this
Neutrogena one I really like all of
these I'm not really using the restore
see I'll pass that on
honestly oh the G way I'll pass on lip
scrub since I like this lip scrub better
I'm gonna pass on the elf one I've had
this Vaseline one a while they've been
dipping my finger into it this one I
haven't had as long so I think that's
better and whittled down that is good
good that's gonna go back so this is the
final look at my lip short this is every
lip product I own except for anything
that's like in my purse or in my
everyday makeup drawer which there's
only a couple of things I also have a
drawer in my new bathroom and I've got a
couple of lip products in there but
they're ones that I love so I know I
wouldn't get rid of them so anything in
those you wouldn't see and of course the
things in my closet like the entire line
of NYX lip colors and then the Avon ones
I want to go through those because I
might truly do a video and there's too
many to go through in this video for
that I feel so much better I was so
worried I'd need like two drawers and
like I don't need to have two drawers
for lip products I don't wear enough of
them to warrant that even though even
with me having a channel I don't need
two drawers of lip product this is so
much more manageable it's still way more
than I'll ever ever use and
and they're still gonna be products in
here that I might overtime get rid of go
through etc but I feel so much better so
to show you the organization I have
mostly lipglosses here I have a few like
liquid lipstick kind of things some
lipsticks just cuz they fit better these
are all liquid lipsticks
that's my lip sense back there lip balms
anything that was either pencil-like or
it just wouldn't fit in the lipstick
because of the shape then I've got my
lip liners these two lipsticks and then
the rest of my lip sticks that is
awesome
look at all of these lip products I'm
getting rid of and that would be a
complete second drawer so I'm I don't
like to brag on myself but sometimes
that's what you need when you declutter
and I'm very proud of myself because to
be honest when I started filming this
today on my phone I thought well I'll
probably keep you guys heard me I
thought well I'll probably keep these
products that I haven't opened yet etc
but if I know in my heart that I'm gonna
end up decluttering them anyway and I
don't plan on filming a video it's dumb
for me to keep them for a year just to
declutter later after i've swatched them
when really i can give them away now and
end up making someone very very happy
but also they can be brand new products
so i know some people don't understand
that and some people think wow that's so
wasteful why are you so ungrateful with
the company it's not it's that i love
makeup so much that i wouldn't want it
to sit in a drawer and just not get used
and just rot I would rather someone else
that also loves makeup get to experience
that joy because it is joyful to me and
the declaring process is a joyful
process for me I hope that you guys
enjoyed and if you want to see some of
my other declutter videos I will link
below I've done it for years I'm usually
pretty darn cutthroat like this and I
get rid of a lot of stuff pretty much
always and if you are inspired by me and
you do a declutter video please let me
know what your channel is below I would
love I watched a clutter videos more
than any other video on YouTube I watch
them all the time and I think for me it
works the other way around too because
you guys inspire me to declutter more
and so actually what inspired this today
not only just watching so my old videos
but I was watching some other people too
cluttering and I was like yeah I'm in
that mood
it's time so and I knew this was the
this was the group of things that needed
it the most even though I just a
cluttered so hopefully this was
enjoyable helpful I know it was probably
shaky because I was doing it just
handheld but I love sharing this stuff
with you guys and I hope that it
inspires you guys I hope you'll
subscribe I just said you guys so many
times I love you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
