feel like I just so recently declared
this but it's crazy that it crawled up
to be so much yet again but again I have
told you in the past in past videos that
a lot of this is sent to me some of it
I'm sure my channel some as I don't
whether I have an interest in it or
whether you guys have an interest in it
really plays a part in that but I've
kept a lot of these just just in case I
do a video and then I never do so it's
time for me to really be serious about
this because I've had all these lipstick
and it I have so many that makes me not
want to wear lipstick and I know that
sounds crazy but it's overwhelming to
look at so I wear the same like two
lipsticks over and over again just
because I've got too may it's not even
worth likes or dangers so then nothing
is getting used so I'm going to do it
the same way I did the other declutter
swear I just look at my entire
collection here and ask myself what
would I go to the store and buy again
what do I love enough to do that with so
in doing that the first one I think of
is my favorite read Marc Jacobs one in
Oh Miley and it's this unbelievably
perfect read my husband loves when I
wear this I love and I it's just
comfortable these are really expensive
lipsticks but for good reason they're so
so good so creamy they stay on I love
this so this is it's like the easiest
one for me to say yes I'm keeping that
next one I want to keep just because
it's still new to me is this beauty
lipstick and beetroot it's a really
pretty color again really creamy just
like the Marc Jacobs ones but I have
gotten like virtually no use out of this
because it's so new and I've been
overwhelmed so excited to have that
color in my collection another one that
surprised me how much I liked it is this
Clinique one it's the Clinique almost
lipstick and pink honey and that is the
perfect description it's almost lipstick
it's just a really light wash
comfortable to wear almost feels like a
lip balm like a tinted lip balm I was so
surprised at how much I liked
so I'm definitely keeping that that kind
of has been living in my purse for a
while this was the wedding the lipstick
I wore on my weddings by Edward Beth and
it's in Rose de Muir and it's this
beautiful pink but like with a blue tint
kind of lipstick I love this eventually
it's going to get too old to wear but
it's one of those sentimental things
that I would just keep just for that
reason but I love it it's such a
comfortable formula another one that I
love over here I can grab it is this
NARS audacious lipstick in Raquel I keep
saying Barbara that's not what it is
it's Raquel these are an amazing formula
I love this color it's just such a
pretty neutral oh my gosh so definitely
keeping that a MAC lipstick that I love
it's called patisserie it's probably my
favorite MAC lipstick I've owned a lot
over the years and gotten rid of a lot
because it's not my favorite formula to
be honest this one is just so pretty and
natural it's kind of one of those
everyday colors I love it another one I
was really surprised by how much I like
blue another one that I was surprised by
how much I liked is this elf velvet
matte one and deep burgundy it's this
beautiful burgundy color reminds me of
the NARS formula it's not quite as
creamy but it's pretty close and it has
the same kind of a look to that formula
I love this one some shades that I'm
probably going to get rid of this one in
black out is just it's literally black
so if you're looking for that that is
your guy but I certainly don't need that
and this one's in vampy violet and it's
again just a little bit too deep for me
but I know some people would love that
so it's a good formula I love their
Velvet Matte alright continuing on I
think those are all of the ones that I
wanted to like pull up specifically now
let's kind of go one by one to decide if
I want to keep it or pass it on and put
square one on the edge here there we go
alright then I'll do one thank you
so this one here is by Estee Lauder and
their pure color envy and powerful it's
a really cool pink and it's one of those
like I forgot that I even have this so
if I have less I'll be excited to use it
because it's a really nice formula so I
think I am
to hold on to that one this one is
Revlon Colorstay pink in the afternoon I
love this but I've had this for so long
I think it's just time I've had it for
years and years and years it was one of
the first lipsticks I ever bought and I
love this formula but I just think it
might be time so I'm gonna pass out
these are my Rimmel Kate Moss like nude
collection I have three shades 41 45 and
47 these are all really pretty so that
one's 41 months watchmen side-by-side I
don't think the formula is like
unbelievable like you have to have but I
do think it's pretty comfortable so
that's 45 that's 47 so right off the bat
I think I can say okay I can get rid of
47 because I don't think I really need
that color in my collection out of these
two I'm going to try them on from the
gravity all right so after putting these
on my list
I realize this 141 is just a little bit
too light that one is perfect though so
45 I'm going to keep and 41 and 47 I'm
gonna pass on so I just tried this Estee
Lauder color and powerful this one here
on my lips and I don't like the way it
looks on me it's just a little bit too
bright so I'm actually going to pass
that on see I'm glad I turned this one
good alright continuing so this is a
flower beauty little Hydra self ultimate
lip butter in blush petal I'm going to
try this on let me swatch it for you
though it's a it's brighter
I might not love it I might know let me
try it on so it's way too bright however
this is the silkiest most comfortable it
almost feels like a lip balm but it's
got a nice color punch so I know they
have other shades I think I might try
one that would actually be a good shade
for me but this one is just not again
cute packaging they always have adorable
packaging this is a Clinique one it came
in like a little kit and it's there it's
in their Clinique pop lip color in
cherry pop I mean it looks really pretty
but it might be a little I like red but
I like them to be a little bit deeper
than that so I think I'll pass it on
Katrice this is one of their tinted
bombs there's a lot of companies coming
out with these now where it kind of
reads your you know the temperature and
kind of adjust to your skin which is a
cool idea in theory that I have a couple
of these so I'm going to put this in a
maybe and decide which one I want to
keep because I've got too many of these
these are my ELF touch of lipsticks
there's like touch of berry touch of
pink and such as oh this is just perfect
finger these are saying oh this okay
this is just like the Catrice one where
it's kind of a tone adjusting color so
I've got two of that kind and then these
which touch of pink touch of pink I like
because it's like a just a comfortable
color but the touch of berry I think if
I'm ever wearing a berry I want it to be
a true berry I don't need like a halfsie
berry you know what I mean so I'll pass
that one on touch of thing I'm going to
keep these there and if I find any more
kind of similar to these I'm going to
compare them and just pick one now we
get to all of my bare minerals ones I
had actually filmed a video but the
footage was almost up of like they sent
me all of these and all of they're like
liquid lipsticks and all of their lip
glosses and I had done a video on all of
them and the footage shot messed up so
it never I mean it was hook me forever
to film - it was so set but anyway I'm
not filming it again and honestly there
hasn't been enough of you guys asking
about it so I'm like alright I don't
know that it's worth devoting that time
to this but these were my out of all of
the different things they came out with
in there Jen nude lines I really like
these lipsticks because they were really
comfortable they weren't matte they were
just comfortable regular old lipstick so
I'm going to find I don't want to let
myself keep more than two that sounds
fair to me this is way too many but I
think two is good so this one's in crave
me adjust the focus you guys can really
see it so this one's in crave that's
really pretty this one's in karma that's
an easy one to get rid of that'll look
crazy on me it's pretty go this one's in
notorious that one's pretty this one's
in sexpot now way to light in xox
looks like a cross between this one and
this one this one's in heaven someone's
pretty so heaven is the only one so far
that I've actually liked on my lips so
so far this is the one I'm sleeping
let's keep going honeyBun
it's pretty - very very similar to that
just a little bit more Brown turns out
it looks crazy on me so new get rid of
next one
posh oh I have a feeling this one won't
look great on me no that needs to be on
someone else Pasha is going to go
nudists this might be too light I'll try
that is a hard pass that one looks crazy
on me as well and the last one is crush
this one looks pretty that could work on
me
let's see so this one looked okay but
again still not my favorite so I think
the only one out of all these I'm to
keep is heaven isn't that crazy but it
was just so pretty and nice and I just
liked it
alright moving along so that I mean that
is awesome I just got rid of a ton so
that makes me feel really good so now
I've got some Catrice products so now I
have well this is from absolute New York
so red lipstick I just don't need I have
my favorite red lipstick it's not even
worth I've never used it before I'm
going to pass it on this is by Catrice
it's their ultimate stay called beauty
and every pink in the shade that might
be just that's the kind of thing I don't
like on me so I'm going to pass that one
on this is by Catrice their ultimate
color in red my lips again this is so
new I love a really free drugstore price
brand they do a great job packaging
their stuff that one is really nice
though it reminds me of my Marc Jacobs
one this one really is beautiful I'm
going to keep this because it just might
be a dupe for the Marc Jacobs one it's a
little bit more glossy but I'm sure see
like as it wears throughout the day if
it like kind of dries down at all this
is one of my favorites this is birthdays
lipstick stitch is kind of a natural
everyday just
normal pink it's just kind of I don't
know I just really like these I always
have this in my purse but it's in the
shade blush Basin honestly I feel like I
mean I'm just never going to use these
elf ones I really don't need them just
Catrice one I think I might keep this
again it's such a newer brand to me that
I want to kind of try out just like this
red lipstick I want to give them a
chance so I'm going to keep both of
those and I got rid of those other ones
these are two from nuance by Salma Hayek
there's it's their true color moisture
rich lipstick this one is in baby's
breath pink and this was in plum wine I
have an open knees and since again this
is a newer brand to me I want to open it
because I want to see are they any good
kids if they are I might review them or
even if they're terrible I guess I might
let you know like I stay away from these
are terrible to waste your money but I
really haven't heard much about I really
haven't heard much about this brand so
this one's baby's breath pink
that's pretty like really pretty so it's
a really pretty light pink these taste
and smell like mint these are really
pigmented but really creamy and
comfortable I don't think these are
necessarily a long wear lipstick by any
means but it's really comfortable let's
open this plum one so here's the plum
one whoa
that is quite lovey again crazy creamy
though I mean these just glide right on
honestly neither one of these colors are
right at my alley this one's just a
little bit too light and this one's just
a little bit more purple than what I
like but they're really creamy so I
don't think I'm going to keep them but I
might look just because I know I won't
wear them but I might look for other
shades like if there's a sale or
something and try those out so far I'm
getting rid of what a more than what I'm
keeping so I think this is the ideal way
to declutter all right now it's got my
urban decay ones I just watched all
these in my last two clutter and I'm
sure if you were watching my last
clutters you're like what in the heck
Jess why are those still in there
because I don't remember what I even
decided I think I was like I'm just
going to declutter out and then I pulled
it back out because no I'll do a video
well guess what I never did a video and
now no one cares so it's like why do I
even have these so some of these are
like obvious good
like this one in menace is this bright
bright tucking the gopis this one in
Menace is this bright bright pink it
needs to go it's one in purple which is
pandemonium it needs to go let me just
list all these up this one in conspiracy
needs to go it's like a brown Big Bang
is a glittery pink Firebird I don't
remember what this one oh yeah it's like
a metallic almost duochrome no let's see
naked was too light I wanted to keep it
because I'm like whoa it's so pretty
but if I remember right that was too
light let me try I was wrong this one
actually is a really nice color on me
because it's a little bit deeper of a
nude so I will keep that one it's 7 1 4
7 14 2 megamat in red don't want to
reminds me of Marc Jacobs as well but I
don't need both so let me think about
that one this one's in Rocksteady it's a
cream play it's a little bit deeper oh
it's pretty though let me try that one
on my lips and then this one's been
disturbed the comfort mat oh no that's
way too drunk I can easily pass that one
on let me decide between these reds here
that one looks crazy that's the one in
Rocksteady it's way too dark ok this is
actually a really nice matte red this
one is some 14 totally similar to my
Marc Jacobs one so I'm actually going to
keep that one but I'm going to get rid
of I'm gonna get rid of Rocksteady so I
only ended up keeping 2 out of all those
naked and 714 so that is awesome let's
the keep the goin okay so I have one
more Urban Decay one here at different
actually it might be the same line that
I think they like repack she packaged
them I don't remember but this one's in
protest and I actually really like this
one it's just kind of like a creamy
deeper nude it's one of the ones that I
really really like so I'm definitely
going to keep that one the L'Oreal
committees these are all the different
pink there's all the different
celebrities Pink's of course some of
them are much much deeper depending on
the skin tone so this one's Doutzen no I
can tell you right now in no way so that
one is an e-zpass I won't wear that
bright pink
Ava pink let's see someone's a pretty
pink the only thing I hate about L'Oreal
lipsticks is the smell I hate the smell
okay just so you know I just went to
this off and as I looked at myself again
in this protest color I did not like it
so I'm going to pass it on so let's try
on this one no I don't like this one
either so pass on Ava this is JLo so
it's much deeper he's coming the fourth
it doesn't seem great see what I mean
I won't like that and pass that one on
Julian it's too light look at that it's
not even like coming on the world in the
world this is the weirdest let me get
that you guys can see do you see this
isn't that the weirdest thing it's like
it's just not let me show you like live
it's like nothing's coming on that is
the weirdest thing definitely passing on
that so this one's Blake Lively's pink
like a flamingo it probably would look
really pretty on her like a bright coral
I might try that one on I don't think
I'll like it this one's in Leah's or lie
as pink oh oh yeah see these formulas
are not consistent because that was a
much better formula I'm going to try
both of these on I don't know that I'll
like either one but it's worth a try no
the blake one looks bonkers on me no
this one looks crazy on me too so turns
out i didn't like any of those I don't
like the formula of these these are just
not good I mean these are just I'm being
honest these are kind of a horrible
formula compared to every other lipstick
I try this formula is not good at all
right so again I'm getting rid of tons
oh my gosh this is kind of crazy how
many of them throw myself now these are
a lot of my favorites so we'll see what
I actually read
here this much J cups one is in bad
behavior it's just not first of all
pinocchio got to it but i love to
packaging i thought i would really like
this color but it just doesn't look
great on me in my skin tone i was trying
to branch out but i'm going to pass that
on now these two you guys know i love
their marc jacobs formula
this one's an infamous one of my
favorites kind of a deeper nude and then
clearly i liked a very specific kind of
thing this one's in Sainik truth which
is really pretty as well so i'm going to
keep both of those these two are very
very similar they came they're actually
some of their like famous lipstick
colors in creme de nude and velvet teddy
however they are in limited edition
packaging to go along with their
perfumes that they have like this
the creme de nude i think it's just too
light
i keep trying they keep trying to make
it work and it's just too light so i'm
going to pass that one on but I do like
velvet teddy
funny story my husband Tyler had
actually bought me velvet teddy last
Christmas
for a lipstick present and it got all
chewed up by Tokyo our dog he's clearly
a nightmare but anyway and so like
literally on Christmas Day I got it I
was so excited and then he chewed it up
so that was that so I'm excited to kind
of have it again so I'm definitely gonna
keep that one this is the YSL one in
number one it's their Rouge beloved see
like I never use this but it's really
pretty really comfortable it's not like
a long wearing like matte lipstick this
is just a comfortable moisturizing one
so I do like that this is the number
seven lipstick in romantic I could not
find it when I was filming a video about
the target makeup brands I really like
this color as a formula this one's a
sigma one in in spades and it's a really
pretty color and we try it all - you
don't want the sense about it it's a
nice color but do I really need it
probably not but I actually like it so I
think all for now I'll keep it and this
is a Mac Zac Posen one it's like this
bright power red pink I love
this stays on all day I love it so
definitely keeping that okay so here's
what I'm keeping over here that is
everything I'm getting rid of that is
awesome that's such a good feeling to
know like I could close my eyes reach in
a drawer and grab any of these lipsticks
and feel happy with what I'm putting on
my lips the only one I think I might
this Sigma one I just don't think I care
enough about to keep so I think I'm
going to pass that one on as well
anything else that kind of sticks out as
one that maybe I'll pass on the rest of
them I really do like that's kind of the
only you know what I'm never going to
use this Catrice one I like the idea of
these tinted lip balms I just don't ever
use it so I'm going to pass that one on
as well Oh Jesse you're on a roll that
makes me feel better so even getting rid
of those last few okay I'm keeping 19
lipsticks getting rid of 42 that is
awesome
that's 61 lipsticks total normally QB 19
that's I'm very proud of that so I'm
basically getting rid of like two-thirds
of my lipstick collection awesome so if
you like these kinds of declutter videos

got years worth of declutter we're just
