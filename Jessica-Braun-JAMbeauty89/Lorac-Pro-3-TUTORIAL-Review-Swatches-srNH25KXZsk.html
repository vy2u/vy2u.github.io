gonna share with you guys my review and
a tutorial using the lorac pro 3 palette
so I want to go through kind of the pros
and cons of this palette first and then
I'll go into the tutorial so the lorac
pro 3 of course is the third in their
series of pro palette so the first lorac
Pro looks like this it's got they all
have a row of matte and a row of shimmer
if you didn't know and this is a really
popular one it really just have a nice
range of colors and then the lorac pro 2
is very interesting group of shadows
again a real matte role of shimmer it
definitely adds in some interesting
splashes of colors like the purple the
blue the green things like that and then
the third one the one that I was the
most out of all three to finally get my
hands on is a lot more warm tones again
a row of matte in a row of shimmer as
they always have but I these colors just
really called to me and I think the
reason I loved it so much is because
they had so many kind of medium colors
but a lot of different versions a lot of
different tones so like they've got clay
which is a nice warm brown but then they
have cool taupe which of course is cool
then they got terracotta which is like a
nice yellowy almost camel color and that
I mean it's just such a nice range then
they have these beautiful shimmers
so looking at the swatches you can see
how all of these are incredibly buttery
incredibly pigmented and you'll see in
this tutorial they really blend really
well I mean incredibly well the only
gripe I have about the formula is that
there is insane
fallout so I made the mistake of doing
my face makeup first today for the
tutorial and then doing the eye makeup
and there was so much fallout usually I
can just grab a fluffy brush and wash it
away but today it was really sticking so
I grabbed my Beauty Blender that had
foundations still on it and concealer
and just kind of use that to blend it in
and it's fine so you know it is one
thing to keep in mind especially if
you're using these darker colors it
definitely falls out and you want to
really be aware of that or be smarter
than I am and do your eye makeup first
then do your face makeup easy way to fix
that but that is a big problem and that
is that they complained a lot of people
have about
these lorac Pro palette the next
complaint I have is this medallion shade
this shade is nonsense it's there's
nothing there like I've never in my life
when you compare that to gosh any of
these like here's rose bronze these are
so pigmented you can already see a
little bit of extra powder but that
medallion shade is just kind of like
nothing it's the only one that has my
actual like chunks of glitter in it and
so that's my only guess as to why the
formula is so weird but I know I'm not
alone a lot of you guys have told me the
same thing about that shade the only
other con gripe about this palette I
have is that it gets dirty all of them
so easily now I know that sounds silly
but for me it just bothers me and you
can even see on the first one it was the
same the second one I haven't used as
much so it's not really that dirty but
this one I've only had about three weeks
and it's already I mean it's just it's
just a mess I feel like it's just a mess
so I love however the pretty beige
packaging so it's kind of like I just
fit everywhere did you see that it's
kind of just like I mean it's not really
that big of a deal but you know it is
one of those things to keep in mind if
you're you know kind of deciding between
a couple pallets and you're really torn
that is one thing I've noticed now the
price point on this is $44 comparatively
like the naked palettes are anywhere
from like 50 to 54 kind of depending on
where you get it seems to keep going up
in price so it is a little bit cheaper
and honestly I feel like a lot of these
I'm getting more looks out of beets and
I do with my naked palettes might be
because these are newer to me and so I'm
a little more excited about them but I
love the naked house but these are like
10 dollars cheaper and you usually will
get like a primer with it they're lorac
behind the scenes eye primer or
something like that it's a good primer
it's a very standard eyeshadow primer
but it does help avoid creasing help
kind of intensify the shadows just a
little bit so that's always nice to have
that extra thing to come with it
so let's go ahead and get into the
tutorial of me applying this look to my
eyes today so the first thing I'm going
to do is get my NYX jumbo eye pencil in
milk and just put that all over as a
primer it also helps to intensify the
shadows then I'm going to take the shave
canvas with a big fluffy brush and kind
of set that primer
all over the place from the brow to the
lash line then I'm going to take light
gold with a flatter brush and just pack
that all over the lid next i'm going to
take clay which is that nice warm medium
brown and just work that into my crease
all throughout and then I'm taking a
naked brush to blend it then I'm going
to take amethyst and I'm going to put
that with a smaller brush just in the
outer corner and then I'm also going to
work it into my crease and I'm going to
take a fluffy brush again with nothing
on it just to blend out the edges all
I'll City then I'm going to take
jet-black very scary very intimidating
and again I'm going to put that on my
outer corner but I'm not going to work
this into the crease until I start
blending there's so much fallout with
these shadows so I'm not just blending
with a little bit denser of a brush kind
of into the crease then I'm going to
take terracotta and with the fluffy
brush I'm just blending all of it
together and kind of warming up this
look then I'm going to take Blanc and
with a smaller brush I'm just putting
that under my brow bone and I did blend
that in I just forgot to show it then
I'm taking light gold and I'm spraying
it and I'm putting that just on my lid
on the inner part into the center of it
and then I'm just going to kind of blend
that into the look so it looks a little
more seamless then I'm taking jet-black
again a more detailed brush I'm just
getting my lower lash line just to
deepen that up I'm going to put mascara
down there just to kind of deepen that
area starting at the outer corner
working my way in and then I'm going to
take light gold on a very detailed brush
spray it I'm using the Milani setting
spray you could use mac's fix+ or
anything with glycerin
put that on the inner corner and now I'm
just quickly quickly I'm using a pencil
liner and then a liquid liner on top and
then I also put on fake lashes for this
look afterwards and here it's a final
look you can see that lash glue girl I
see that lash glue
so hopefully this video was helpful for
you as you're looking at pallets
thinking about what's worth buying
what's not like I said in many videos if
you look at the pallet and you think to
yourself you know I really don't like
that many of those colors then it's not
worth buying because you're not going to
use it but like for me when I looked at
this pallet I was like oh my gosh like
every single shade in there I would use
in every single shade other than that
crummy one I do use now looking back
looking at the lorac pro 2 this one I
kind of looked at and thought to myself
like I don't think I'm going to use that
many shades and guess what there's still
some that are completely untouched
so now I will say the shimmery shades I
love and I use that crazy and I love
light brown and nectar but like the Navy
one the charcoal one cool gray I never
ever ever touch so always something to
keep in mind when you're deciding on
palettes to not get just swept away by
the height of it or because it looks
pretty
if you individually look at each shadow
and you think I'm only going to use five
of those shadows then it's not worth
your money there are other palettes out
there that are really going to get your
attention and really be useful to you so
as I said I hope this video is helpful I
hope you'll subscribe if you enjoy these
kinds of videos and if you have any
suggestions of videos you'd like me to
film please let me know below other than
that I'll catch you on my social media
and the meantime where I like to share
different makeup goodies throughout the
day and I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
