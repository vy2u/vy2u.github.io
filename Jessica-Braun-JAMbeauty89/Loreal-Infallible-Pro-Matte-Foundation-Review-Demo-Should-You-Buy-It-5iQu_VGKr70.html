quick review of the L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte foundation now this I got I
realized and you'll see in a second I
filmed a first impressions kind of
talked through as I applied it for the
first time which I'll show you in just a
second and I realize it's way too dark
for me I have it in the shade 103
natural buff but the one underneath it
was way too light so either I'm going to
have to buy the other one and mix them
or try and return it and get the lighter
and then use a bronzer to make it work
so I wish they had maybe a little wider
of a color range for the fair-skinned
half and I'm not even sure about the
darker they probably need a wider range
across the board regardless that was the
one thing I noticed but I'm going to go
ahead and show you how I applied it I
did it two different ways on each side
of my face to show you how it applies
with a brush and then also just with my
hands so let's go ahead and watch so I'm
really sick so I've got a lot of just I
just feel like a lot of pressure just
tons of discoloration and just not
feeling very well today so this is
really going to be put to the test
because I you know my eyes are like just
I'm tired and my nose is a little redder
than it normally is because I'm sick and
I'm blowing my nose um so for all of
those reasons this is really gonna have
to work overtime so we're gonna really
see now what I've already done is I've
already put my serum on and my SPF
moisturizer and I'm kind of letting that
sink in and then on half of my face over
here I'm gonna apply it with my hands
and the other half I'm gonna apply it
with my favorite foundation brush just
to see how it applies in two different
settings now I got mine in the shade 103
buff natural buff so I'm almost positive
this is darker than my skin tone but I
didn't the other one seemed way too
light so I might have to mix two
different colors but for now I just want
to see what it's like not necessarily
color wise but what it's like texture
wise and wear wise so I've got some here
I'm going to apply it just to this oh
yeah way too dark
oh my gosh just to this side of my face
and we're gonna blend it in oh my gosh
you guys what oh my gosh
this is like the Loompa status
whoa trying to kind of get it it seems
to blend really kind of seamlessly with
your hand um aside from the fact that
it's so dark for my skin um but you can
already tell that a lot of that
discoloration even under my eye has gone
now it's not perfect and of course I'm
going to use a concealer as well but I
always have hyperpigmentation here and
that is gone um and it doesn't feel
sticky already it doesn't feel sticky so
I like honestly I like the way to apply
with my hand let's try it with the brush
so I'm still going to kind of dot it
everywhere and then I'm going to blend
it with the brush this the texture of
this seems to be pretty not liquidy but
it's certainly creamy it's not like a
thick consistency that's for sure oh my
gosh this color is so bad on me this is
going to look really orange on you even
if this were your skin tone I don't know
now this did not this did not blend as
evenly as this did with my hand now I
did I don't think I put as much on let's
get a little more yeah I don't know that
I suck
so it doesn't it's only it's already
been you know 30 seconds to a minute
it doesn't feel sticky at all kind of
doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything
like I said the texture is really kind
of creamy it's very very creamy see now
you can see how dark it is compared to
my skin tone but you can see that it's
really really a creamy consistency but
it's not super liquidy like some of the
newer ones that have come out are but
it's also not super thick like the
Revlon whipped that I like but it is
thicker or like a the Tarte moosie
foundation it's not like that either
it's kind of right in between now this
foundation claims to be a demi matte
meaning that it's just somewhat matte
but not completely which is ideal for me
that's kind of more like a satin and I
feel like I would say it is a demi matte
you can still see a little bit of my
natural shine coming through but kind of
in a nice way
like I'm kind of loving this this might
be the only foundation I've ever tried
that I loved this much just upon first
application I have glitter all over from
what I was wearing yesterday that's
funny I really liked it and it did a
good job too of covering some redness I
had on my nose now I could pile more on
but I think for everyday wear this
almost feels like a BB cream but it has
a lot higher coverage it still it's
claims to have medium coverage and I
would agree I would almost say medium to
high because I think it did a pretty
darn good job and once I get concealer
on and my eyebrows look normal and I
just start to look more like myself I
really feel like this is going to be
amazing
so here I am now about six hours later
and I've noticed that it is a little bit
greasy err here which that might have
been because I also used the setting
spray the infallible setting spray and
I'll have a review to that as well if
it's already up I'll post the link below
and that added a little bit of doing
this so I'm not sure if it was because
of that or not but it seems to be
getting together really nicely now all I
would have to do to get rid of that
would be just to powder it a little bit
and I don't mind doing that and I also
don't mind the natural oils coming out
just a little bit because I think it
just it makes you look a lot more
lifelike and a lot more glowy and not
quite so powdered and caked up you know
so I don't mind that this is marketed as
a Demi matte foundation so you know it
is supposed to have a little bit of life
in it and not just completely matte
which is what I like more of a satin
finish the price of this is $12.99 which
is pretty expensive for a drugstore
foundation however there are always
sales going on buy one get one half off
sale so if you are wanting to get maybe
both of these you could get one for half
off and coupons and things like that so
keep your eyes peeled if you're
interested packaging wise I love that
it's so thin it'd be great to travel
with which is always on my mind and I
love that it's a squeezy tube because
it's kind of easier to keep clean if you
just wipe it off each time you use it
and it's not exposed to the air and the
elements each time you use it
one of my favourite foundations is the
Revlon Colorstay whipped and that is
just an open jar so every time you use
it you're dipping your finger into it
and it's really not the most sanitary
packaging so I do appreciate that in
this I love that you you know you don't
have to worry about the glass jars we
have to shake it into your hand this
really is great the only way it could be
better is if there were a pump but I do
like this packaging the texture as I
touched on is a very creamy formula it's
not super liquidy but it's also not
super thick it's kind of right in
between the coverage is marketed as a
medium coverage I would say it's a
medium to full because you really can
layer it on and make it look really nice
but what I like about it is that as you
layer it on it doesn't get cakey er I I
was really amazed by that and when I get
the right shade of this I think I will
end up reaching for this a lot because
it's exactly what I look for in a finish
I think I prefer to apply this with my
fingers over a brush I noticed that it
was a little more flawless coverage
another way you could apply this with a
Beauty Blender however I typically I've
kind of moved away from my Beauty
Blender for a while
I've noticed that it really does shear
out the coverage for me and I don't
always love that so for right now I
think I'm going to continue using my
hands to apply this versus the brush the
wear time on this I would say is pretty
darn good I would say it would last all
day I don't think you need to reapply I
mean I don't know anyone that reapplies
the foundation anyway but I think that
it does a really great job I did not use
a primer underneath it the wear time
would be even better if I did but I
really wanted to see how it would work
just on my skin as it is with just a
moisturizer underneath so I was
impressed with how well at war it
doesn't it didn't break up or anything
weird it didn't oxidize I mean I am
super impressed with this foundation how
it felt on my skin throughout the day it
feels like there's nothing on my skin it
doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like
oily it doesn't feel dry I mean it just
feels like there's nothing on my skin
it's kind of amazing I really really
impressed this is the first drugstore
foundation in a very long time that I
have like felt gushy over that even
though it's not even the right color
although on camera it doesn't look as
bad but even though it's not the right
color I'm still gushing over it because
it is such an amazing formula overall
would I recommend it absolutely even
though it's more expensive it's still
way cheaper than high-end products and
it really does give you that high-end
feel I mean it feels like air it looks
satiny and beautiful it lasts all day so
yes I would recommend it run out if you
can swatch it before you buy it try but
I know in drugstore you really can't you
know unless they are awesome and they
have them out for you to try so that is
the one downside but if you're fair like
me 103 is way too dark so get one of the
other two just so you know hopefully
that review is helpful for you guys if
you're interested in more drugstore
foundation reviews and other drugstore
reviews stay tuned and subscribe and
I'll catch you guys soon bye gorgeous
that is I mean that is beautiful the
only downside is it does have a little
bit of glitter
but these are minty they're nice and I
already own it I think I'm just gonna
keep it this however this is an LA color
chunky lip pencil in the shade I don't
know
there's the shade name wine and I've
only swatched it it's a very sheer and I
think this is I mean this is the way
it's supposed to be I think they're made
to be that way
it's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
