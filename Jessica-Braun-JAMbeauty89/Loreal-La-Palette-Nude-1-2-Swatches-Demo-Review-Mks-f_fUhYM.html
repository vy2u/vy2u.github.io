reviewing both of the new L'Oreal 'la
palettes and they are both called the
lapel at nude but one is the lapel at
nude one and the other is number two so
I am going to show you a demo of me
applying these shadows to my eyes today
so you can kind of see what these
shadows look like in action and then
after the demo I'm going to show you
swatches of both palettes and then kind
of talk about the pros and cons of
whether or not I think it is worth going
out and purchasing or if you should pass
on it so let's go ahead and get started
okay so I'm going to start by actually
throwing some concealer on my lids a lot
of times I use primer but I am trying
out this NYX one the NYX HD one and
comparing it to the gnawers one but I
want something tacky on my lids that's
also going to cancel things out which is
what primers do but concealers are great
for it too so that's what I'm using
today and if you're curious I actually
the concealer I'm wearing today I have
the NYX one on this side and the NARS
one on this side and if that video is
already up I'll link it below where I do
my demo and talk about if they're truly
dupes for each other and if it's not up
then subscribe and stay tuned it'll be
up soon so now I feel like I'm kind of
working with a very neutral base you
know everything's kind of canceled out
it's just tacky enough that's perfect
for eyeshadow so I'm actually going to
be doing a demo with the palette 1
because that's the one that as I've been
using these over the past week it's like
the only one I ever want to use it's got
all the colors I want to create a full
look there are some colors from two that
I really really like but one has more
that I like so that's the one that I'm
going to be demoing from so I'm just
going to use a bigger fluffy brush this
is the Sigma e-40 I'm going to be using
this shade here which is the fifth one
in and it's kind of a really nice
lighter mid-tone color that's great for
the crease which is where I'm starting
today so I'm just gonna kind of sloppily
place that in the crease as I usually do
for kind of a mid color just going back
and forth
for the lid I'm going to take my the
brush that actually came with it the
little sponge tip end and use this very
far color it's kind of a shimmery silver
and this is something I would typically
use my finger for but sponge applicators
kind of achieve the exact same thing you
know have to get your fingers all dirty
in fact it comes with it it's kind of a
bonus now I'm going to take the second
one next to it which is kind of a
grayish tone and put it in my crease
again I'm just using the elf crease
brush it's a really kind of more detail
crease brush and I'm just going to work
it not all over like I did before but
actually right in the crease it's gonna
kind of cool down this look just a
little bit so it's not too warm cuz I'm
not a big fan of totally warm eyes on
myself
now I'm going to take this fourth color
right here and I'm going to use the
brush that came with it not the sponge
side with the brush side and I'm going
to very kind of use this as a detail
brush to just do the outer corner so
we're almost done
I'm going to take this fourth shade in
it's kind of a golden but it's a little
bit deeper and just with my finger I'm
going to Pat it on on the center of my
lid and the very last step I'm going to
take with the eye shadow look is I'm
going to take this shade on the very end
it's kind of a matte not quite it's a
little bit more of a satin but I'm just
going to take a fluffy brush and get a
little bit on there and start up here to
just kind of lighten up the brow bone
and then also throw some here on the
inner part and then just mix everything
together
one last step I'm going to take is to
take that this third one in and use the
brush that came with it and do a little
bit of on my lower lash line just to
kind of hold bring a whole look together
and I'm just kind of pressing it in
because this brush is a little bit
sloppier than like I would typically use
on my lower lash line and so I don't
want it to flop and fly all over my face
so I'm just kind of lightly throwing it
they're only going about 1/3 of the way
in so almost halfway so I'm going to go
ahead and finish my look here and I'll
see you guys in a second so you can see
that I feel that these shadows blended
very well together now of course I
wasn't using every single shadow in the
palettes because that would be
redonkulous but um I really feel that as
I've been using this over the past week
that none of the shadows I've tried have
been unblended also I will say these
blend well together in my opinion let's
go through the swatches so you can kind
of see what they look like just washed
but know that anytime you're applying an
eyeshadow with your finger it's going to
look very different than when you apply
it with a brush but just so you can get
an idea of the colors that are in these
palettes together
so here you can see all the swatches for
the lapel at nude one and you'll notice
that there are a lot more light colors
in this one than dark colors which I
really like I feel like the number one
palette has a lot more to offer when it
comes to range of shades and it also has
a good mix of matte and satiny shimmery
shades that I feel like you can get a
matte look if you wanted and a shimmery
look or just kind of a mixed look like
what I did today
which I love now let's look at the nude
two swatches so you'll see in this one
there are a lot more deep colors in this
palette and there are also a lot more
rosy and Mavi toned colors in this
palette now this is one that I have a
few favorites in here that I kept
reaching for but there were a lot that I
never felt drawn to using and I do feel
like this
is more of a pallet for someone that
loves deeper colors and rosy colors like
I mentioned but also that just does more
smokey eyes than I would I feel that
this is a beautiful palette but it's
just not in my taste so I really feel
that if you're at the store you're
watching this video and you're really
thinking about just buying one of them
you just have to think about what is in
your taste that you'll actually use and
one kind of rule I've been living by is
looking at a palette and going through
and saying okay let's look at this shade
here would I wear this where would I
wear it on my eye okay I would wear it
on my lid yes would I wear this one yes
I wear it on my lid would I wear this
one yes I'd wear it my crease when I
wear this one yes probably on my lid
what I wear that and just literally
going through one by one and if you feel
that more than half the palette like
when I look at the second one and I go
through it and I'm being honest with
myself and my taste and I say okay um
would I wear this dark one maybe on my
lower lashline when I wear this like
rosy kind of brown one probably not
because I wouldn't like it with my skin
tone so I kind of went through this pout
and realized like yeah there's not a lot
that I would use so just keep yourself
in mind instead of going in because of
all the hype around them really think
would I use these shadows or not the
price point on these is kind of tricky
because they are twenty dollars just
like on the L'Oreal website it shows
them as $19.99 but on Walmart's website
and at Walmart they're usually around
sixteen dollars they were I think I had
put on my Instagram when I first bought
these I put a picture up and said they
were 30 99 but then when I lived in my
receipt I'm like knowing were they were
like $15.99 or whatever it was they were
so the price point really ranges but
right now as I looked this up on Ulta
calm L'Oreal was fifty by one given 50%
off and they were both in stock on
ulties website so you could buy bull for
30 bucks because I think they are $20 on
their sites so just keeping that in mind
I'll put the Ulta link for these below
since they're not sold out online yet
that way you can at least maybe get your
hands on them I grab the very last two
at Target where I bought mine of both of
these I couldn't believe they were in
stock the packaging of these I think is
really really cute the only downside is
lid
early I picked it up and there were
fingerprints all over it now I know
that's a silly thing to care about but I
do care about it but I think the
packaging is beautiful I think I don't
really think they can improve upon
anything on the packaging to be honest
other than the fact that it's really
shiny and you know it's hard to film
with but that's kind of a dumb problem
because most people aren't filming these
things so I think the packaging is
gorgeous I even think that the brush
that comes with it is really good that's
why I used it in the demo because the
sponge of applicators they actually are
useful to pack shadow on and then I
actually thought the little brush was
pretty useful on the other side I don't
think I would necessarily do an entire
look with it but you could and that is a
very nice thing as you can see in the
swatches pigmentation wise it kind of
range some are way more pigmented some
work that's true for most eyes shadow
palettes especially in the drugstore but
again when you're applying it with a
brush I think more important things you
should be looking at is do they blend
well can you achieve a really nice look
that you like with it because sometimes
I don't want shadows that are crazy
pigmented because I don't want a really
pigmented look anyway so if you're not
looking for that then you're not
necessarily going to want something
crazy pigmented all the time anyway so I
don't mind that they're not all crazy
buttery pigmented where time is also
really important I have noticed as I've
been wearing these shadows over the past
week they look exactly the same when I
put them on as they do at the end of the
day now I've tried it with many
different primers I've tried them with
paint pots
color tattoos I've tried them with Too
Faced shadow insurance I've tried it
with my wet wild Fergie one which I love
by the way and then today I tried it
with concealer it stays on all day you
guys it does not move now I haven't
tried it without a primer because I
always use prime of its shadow so you
know even if you just have a concealer
on hand used it they won't budge at all
they don't um crease it all I mean oh my
gosh these are really really a good deal
overall what I recommend these
absolutely do I think they're the best
palette in the entire universe no
because I mean obviously if you're going
to spend fifty dollars like on a Naked
palette I think those are absolutely
amazing but do I think that you have to
spend fifty dollars to get a really
amazing palette that looks
I think flawless no you don't have to
spend fifty dollars these are fantastic
they're just different and I know a lot
of people asked you know all are they a
dupe for the naked palettes I think
there are absolutely shadows that could
be dukes
but are they 100% dupes no because
they're just different they're a
different collection of shadows they're
not necessarily the same formula there
might be some similarities absolutely
but that makes sense because any kind of
nude or neutral palette would have
similar colors because you know there's
only so much you can do with nude and
neutral colors so I think if you're
looking for a new palette um I think
these are worth kind of the height
that's around them I know that there's a
lot of mixed reviews on these but you've
kind of seen how they work on me and how
I've been using them hopefully this
review is helpful for you guys if you're
interested in any of my other drugstore
palette reviews I can link I just
recently did a review of well actually
this comparison between a really
high-end palette and a really really
cheap $6 palette that I'll link below
that I totally think is a dupe for the
expensive one but if you're interested
in any of my drugstore review and demos
I will link that playlist below
subscribe if you would and I'll catch
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
