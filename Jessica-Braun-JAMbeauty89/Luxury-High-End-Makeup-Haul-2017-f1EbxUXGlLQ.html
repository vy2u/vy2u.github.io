going to share with you guys any
high-end haul and I am so so excited
let's go and get into it first thing I
finally bit the bullet and bought is the
lorac pro 3 palette I have the first and
second one but every time I would look
online or in stores I would see this one
and think to myself I'm gonna need that
I'm gonna need that right now
so I finally finally visible and bought
it and I just aren't these colors they
just like spoke to me like every time I
would see it I would think that is a
Jessica Brown pal like I love that
palette I love this shade right there I
love it it's got a ton of mass they have
so many more like medium Browns because
that's what I like to use in my crease
and if it's too dark it looks crazy and
if it's too light it doesn't do anything
but they have so many options they've
got like a yellowish one a warmer one a
more cool one they oh my gosh I just
love it the only dud in this palette is
this color called medallion here it is
the weirdest like patchy but crumbly but
it doesn't do anything kind of a shade
isn't that horrible
like how did that get passed on you
start to think when you buy a palette
like this one one shade is weird you
think to yourself like oh it must just
be this fast but I felt so much better
when a lot of you guys on snapchat after
seeing me talk about that said yes I
felt the same way I'm like okay good
well not good because that means they
all sucked out one shade but all the
other ones are unbelievably let me show
you a couple unbelievably pigmented I'm
just my mind is going very very quickly
let me just show you a couple of
swatches I'm going to do a matte one as
well their shadows they're very
different than a lot oh my gosh then a
lot of shadow formulas they kick up so
much power so much so you do I mean like
an unbelievable amount but they're so
pigmented and pretty and they blend it's
what I'm wearing on my eyes today they
blend so beautifully that you're like I
lean and care so when I was applying all
this today I had fallout everywhere and
I do my face makeup before my eye makeup
so I just took like a powder brush and
just wiped it off at the end and it was
fine so and I genuinely didn't need to
apply and you can't see any fallout now
so what I did for
I look I'm wearing today let me see if I
can remember I put rose bronze all over
my lid and then on top of that I put
light gold and then let's see right
under my brow bone I have Blanc right
there and then in my crease I use mostly
clay I love that matte shade but then I
darkened it with a little bit of
amethyst on the outer corner and then I
also used the jet black right here also
on the outer corner kind of smoked out
and then dark mocha on my lower lashline
and I think I added a little bit of rose
bronze on top of that so I love this
palette I love how cute in beige it is I
think they've just knocked this one out
of the park other than the one shadow if
you know that like when you look at the
palette and you know like I'm only gonna
use for the shades then it's not worth
getting it's not worth getting just
because I like it because if you only
like four of the shades you're not going
to like it and I feel like when I look
at my lorac pro one and two I don't use
them as much and I feel like it's
because I don't love every shade whereas
on this I'm like oh my gosh I literally
love every shade except for that stupid
one so I'll shut up about it those are
my thoughts that I love this palette
next thing I bought just because I never
tried their full size of it it's just
the original bare minerals foundation
I've just never tried it like I feel
like I would get like little samples
that it was never the right shade for me
so I was just like and like I just watch
it on my hand but then pass it on to
like a sister I got it in golden fair I
actually think that's a really good
match for me
and I did it online so I was like good
job judge but it just has that classic
sister I love their well rested
concealer so much it is in my January
favourites where I talked about a bunch
of my favorites but also some product I
hate it I can link that below but I
think this is oh my gosh I like to apply
it with a oh gosh seeing it on my hand
like this maybe it's way too light but I
feel like I applied it with a brush the
other day and it looks really nice but
look wipe that look when you blend it
out of course it gosh that still looks
really light on camera but I know that
when I've used it it looked really nice
so maybe I need to like look in
different lighting maybe I look crazy
when I go out
so I'll have to keep you posted maybe I
will need to get a different shade we'll
find out but the formula of this is so
nice now it can look I don't want to say
cakey because it's a totally different
thing because it's this loose powder but
it really has weirdly high coverage for
something that the powder you wouldn't
think it would and it can make your skin
look so healthy so much more so than
pretty much every other liquid
foundation I've ever used but you know
when you're up close you can tell you've
got something on which I mean that's
true for most makeup but it's just if
you've never tried it you need to try it
because it is a really cool formula I
think it looks really nice and healthy
if you travel a lot it's a really easy
way to have a good foundation without
having a liquid in your liquids bag like
if you're carrying on like I usually do
so I really was impressed I need to see
if the shade is right but I really liked
the one next thing I finally bought and
I just filmed today a tutorial with this
is the Tarte shaped paint concealer I
was just tired of all you guys tell me
about it not in a mean way but I was
just tired of not knowing what you meant
when you would say it was amazing so it
has a huge still foot applicator it's
$24 I got it in the shade like sand
which is I think actually works really
well for me the video of my demo and
review of this is up I will link it
below if it's not it will be up very
soon but I was really impressed I think
it applies best with some sort of sponge
like a Beauty Blender
I did it with my actually like my our
teeth brush and it looks nice but I do
think it looks better with the Beauty
Blender just because it's a lot and it
is very brightening but it's also still
kind of lightweight so I think it does I
don't know it just looked a lot more
seamless now what I will say is it does
still think into fine lines if you have
this and it doesn't think into your fine
lines you must have magical fine lines
because I must have so many because it
definitely sinks in but every conceal
I've ever tried sinks into fine lines
and it doesn't bother me that much so I
get over it in the coverage of this and
the comfortability of it said a word
he's amazing so I still would highly
recommend it and I don't have a
drugstore dupe for you guys yet I will
look for one I'm on the hunt but I don't
have one yet so I've also got some new
bite Beauty products
I'm trying out these recipes sent to me
from Influenster and I don't always show
you guys on here what I get from
Influenster but these I was really
excited about so I was like I'm going to
need to show you they sent two lip
liners and two small bite Beauty
lipsticks but I can't find the other one
I don't know where it is they're small
so it must have rolled off but they sent
two lip liners this is their bite lip
pencil in number 20 and it's perfect
every day I'm wearing it today this
perfect everyday lip liner really really
creamy bite Beauty just nails their lip
formulas I mean they are so good so if
you're looking for a very nude classic
natural lip liner you will love number
20 and then they also sent this really
deep one in number 44 that would I mean
it's almost very like you see what I
mean
it would look beautiful on deeper skin
tone so you could totally rock it if you
get it skin tone like mine as well if
you've got the right lip color to go
with it and the lip colors I have this
one's called whiskey and it's meant to
go with this it's more of a brown tone
though but isn't it beautiful and these
are their amuse-bouche lipsticks and
they're so ridiculously comfortable
they're made from food grade ingredients
I have a couple full-size one and you
know what I think I know where this is I
think it's in my purse wanna go grab it
I found it it was in my purse I forgot I
used it so this is the shade honeycomb
and it's again meant to go with that lip
liner aren't these so flippin beautiful
so these duo's are gorgeous I also let
me just show you my other bike lipsticks
on that just because if you're on this
bite Beauty train you might as well have
a better idea I also have this is a
full-size
so like comparing them Sephora sells a
lot of these little duo's with these
small ones or they got like dual and is
ones this one's in fig it's one of their
best selling colors it's a or at least
it is in my opinion it's much more pink
than honeycomb I might like honeycomb or
honestly the other one I have is called
bee truth and it's a gorgeous berry
color so so pretty you do especially for
like beetroot you have to have a
lipliner with them because they're very
very comfortable very pigmented but on
the outer edges of it because it's
almost the thicker formula it can look
really weird few half fab lip liner so
I'm really excited that they're now
putting refiners out at you know some of
them go along with what colors so highly
recommend number 20 and honeycomb and I
also really like beetroot I mean these
are just amazing products speaking of
lip liners another thing that I bought
recently is the Stila stay all day lip
liner in Pinot Noir
which is funny because Pinot Noir is a
red wine but it's darker than this I
just think that's kind of an interesting
name but I wanted a really good red lip
liner this one I haven't tried other
than swatching it it seems like it'd be
really really good and it's a nice
bright red lip liner I've been using
this Urban Decay one that I like okay
but it's just not my favorite I mean
it's just not so I figure it's time I
really like the Sela
stay all day line like I love their
liquid eyeliner it's one of my no it is
my favorite that I've ever tried
I needed buy another one of those but
anyway I really like that so I figured
and I tried to see let's say all day
like liquid lipsticks those are amazing
so I figure why not try the lip liner so
very excited to have that and I'll have
to get back to you on that as well these
next three products I got for free from
octa Lee and it's actually my first
experience with them but the this first
one is this Clarins mascara super volume
it's okay I've used it for like a week
I'm wearing fake lashes today but it's a
nice mascara I think it does a great job
separating and lengthening but it's a
volumizing mascara or at least that's in
the name and I don't think it's very
volumizing so but I do think it's nice
gives a nice natural fluttering look to
your lashes so it's not that it's a bad
mascara it's just that I don't think
it's necessarily volumizing and for the
price tag it's a lot for mascara so the
next two things I got from actually are
from Giovanni these are the very first
things I've ever owned from them and I'm
going to start with the one I was pretty
impressed by this is their lipstick this
is the G watch sheet Rouge inter D
lipstick and number thirteen and it's
the packaging is just cool I mean it's
ridiculous right I love it but it's
friend who I wonder if how it'll look
it's but it's not very like comfortable
you can kind of see it's like a glossy
comfortable formula one swipe is still
pretty pigmented but it isn't why
punch you in the face you can't see
through it opaque kind of a lipstick
which I kind of like I feel like there's
gonna be really comfortable really
pretty in the springtime because it's
kind of a pinkish red and of course it's
got like the G Hoshi little like logo
emblem there so I'm excited to give this
a try especially like I said spring so
soon I'm so excited to try it then this
next product I was not impressed with
and I had so I mean first of all look at
the packaging again is Avanti you push
this in and it pops up it looks so nice
and they're these like little like not
domed but like little bumped up this is
the shimmering news eye palette let me
just show you it seemingly pigmented it
kicks up a lot of dust which I can get
beyond that one is pretty pretty pretty
pretty let me show you this green one it
looks like that one from the lorac three
that medallion Shea it's just this weird
patchy weird mess like it doesn't really
do anything and then there's this white
one here that's the same thing it's like
oh it looks pretty and metallic but when
you swipe it there's nothing there and a
bunch of glitter just fell all over my
my lap so those who are huge does so
then I was like well let's try these
masks well this one here it's okay I
mean it's not really I guess it's watch
is actually not too bad
this one's alright it's a kind of more
camel colored like blending color
doesn't swatch as well but it's okay
like when you're actually applying it
this one not that so I would say the
three masks are okay this bronzy shade
there is pretty nice but then there's
the green and the white and they're just
like for the price tag this is a
ridiculously high price tag the quality
should be unbelievably phenomenal period
because there are drugstore paths out
there that tick but that are so amazing
and they're what hate way cheaper than
this so I'm glad that I didn't pay for
this and you guys always know no matter
if I was spent for it for free or not
I'm always honest with you guys do not
spend your money on this I was very very
disappointed calm down just just makeup
it's just makeup so the last things I
got from
look this is the site where it's a
shopping site I mean anyone can shop on
it but it's flash sale site where
they'll randomly be like closing
companies their makeup company's on
there and it will only be on there for
like four days and there's only certain
products and you can buy things for like
50% off what they normally are but then
after a few days it's gone and then
maybe a couple months later it'll come
back so you do have to check back all
the time to see like if there's products
the bomb is on there a lot Kevin Daquan
is on there a lot what else is on there
steel is on there and remember what else
I feel like Tartans on there from time
to time yeah anyway this was Bobby Brown
and I was very excited because I've only
tried a couple of Bobby Brown things and
I was amazed at how much was available
on there during this sale so I'll put my
way throat look down below it is a
referral link if you're interested I
love whole look I talk about all the
time
that's where I get most of my high-end
makeup because it's 50% off I'm trying
to say money too so the first thing I
got was this foundation it's the
moisture rich foundation SPF 15 and I
got it in the shade porcelain I feel
like they didn't have a ton of shades
and the next one they had up was like
way too dark I don't know that's a
little bit too much I don't like that it
doesn't have a pump let's just kind of
see oh it definitely feels moisturizing
and I don't think this is like a crazy
high coverage kind of foundation because
it kind of just blended into my skin
either that or this match is so
unbelievably perfect kiss yeah it's just
the Masters pretty good but it just
really kind of I don't want to say it
blends away but definitely just kind of
blends until it's seamless and your skin
almost like a BB cream would so I'm
curious I haven't tried this on my face
yet but I am very curious to try it just
to see like is it worth the price tag
because again this is pricey 50% off was
much cheaper but it is still you know
more than what I would pay for a
drugstore foundation I think I got this
for like $18 or maybe somewhere around
there honestly there are some drugstore
foundations that are creeping up on that
price so so I'm excited to try that
feels very like I said moisturizing the
next thing I got was another blush I've
already owned one of their blushes and I
loved it
this one I'm wearing today it's in
pastel pink this reminds me of
that does it Lovejoy that I know full of
joy from Mac I've gotten rid of because
they got how old my think is breaking me
out but I wore that on my wedding day
it's definitely passed out but if you
use a really light hand like I said I
use it today I feel like you can just
look really really nice and pretty and
kind of springy but again you want to be
careful because it is bright color but
they're they're plushies are just nice I
don't think they're like you need to run
out and buy a bunch of them but they're
nice and they stay on all day and they
look healthy and I feel like there's a
lot of blushes out there that you know
you swipe them and there's still
pigmented and everyone's going crazy
over them but they don't last on your
face all day whereas these dudes so I do
trust her blushes next thing I picked up
was this Bobbi Brown clear natural brow
shaper it's just a clear brow gel I
haven't used it yet but I love that it
has a small fully I actually don't use
brow gel every day since I've been using
a pomade lately it just kind of holds
your brows in place naturally so I don't
feel like I need anything else but I
like having it and I like that this was
smaller than my Anasazi one that I love
it's like full size this is so full size
it's just much smaller and I liked it
was clear so figured give it a try since
it was so much cheaper than normal I
also got a long way or cream shadow in a
shade galaxy and I've kind of just
watched this it's a very like not loose
thin formula but it's a really pretty
color I do feel like it's kind of you
need a couple layers or you need to pile
it on top of like a white eyeliner or
eyeshadow base just to really get that
pigment to show up but it's a really
pretty color and this is one that I
would totally put on my eyelids and then
put another shimmery eyeshadow on top of
it just to really make it pop it's kind
of like that pewter color I love that
and I like that with brown eyes I don't
know why I just do so I was really
excited to try that but again so if you
were to look at this at the normal price
tag I would say it's honestly on par
with drugstore so I don't think this is
one you need to pay full price for at
all next thing I got was again this a
shade porcelain it's the Bobbi Brown
skin moisture compact foundation so it's
from that same line this does look
really light but I
I was curious because I don't try a lot
of products like this honestly though
that kind of blended right in I think I
think I I think in my head I'm Tanner
than I am I'm so pale and I know I'm
pale that's why I ordered porcelain but
then I'll see it I'm like no way that'll
work but then I'm like oh wait no
Jessica you really are that decently
pale so I think that will work but I've
never really tried
high-end foundations like this I think
so this comes with like one of those
sponges I haven't used it yet that you
can use to apply it and honestly that
might be the best way to apply it
because you could use a brush you could
probably get your Beauty Blender and if
you wanted to but again
excited to give that a try and I loved
it it was half off so those are all of
the high-end products that I've picked
up recently or gotten from various ways
I've also gotten a lot of like full
ranges of some lip products I'm not
including those in here because I'll
probably do separate videos on them and
this video would be 10 years long
