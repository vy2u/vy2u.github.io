to be sharing with you some products
that I regret buying but all of these
are products that are really expensive
ones really high-end and luxury items
that most of them I purchased myself
some of them were sent to me but
regardless of how they came into my
collection they're products that are
expensive and that I wouldn't recommend
that anyone else purchase so I haven't
decided if I'm going to actually call
this products I regret buying since I
didn't buy all of them but regardless
they're products that I wouldn't
repurchase that I wouldn't recommend so
let's go ahead and get into it alright
so let's just start with a very recent
purchase of mine that I did purchase
this one's from the brand bareMinerals
and it is their bare skin pure
brightening serum foundation it has an
SPF of 20 the idea is that it's a really
thin very lightweight foundation and you
actually squeeze the liquid out of here
and then you blend it into your face
I've worn it only two or three times and
it looked fine I don't know that this
would work with every skin type ever but
I would assume this would work pretty
well if you've got kind of just combo
normal skin maybe if you're really
really oily I don't think that would
work and I think if you're really really
dry I don't know this broke me out so
badly
this was weeks ago I still have like
scars that I was trying to cover today
for the video I mean it broke me out so
terribly and when I finally figured out
it was this I was like ah get it out of
here so this is something that I am it's
leaving my collection in fact all of
these are going to leave my collection
um and I should have known because
bareMinerals products break me out I
just bought some blushes from there
those also broke me out so I'm like oh
my gosh so I need to just remember that
unless it's like just going on my eye
area or my lips I can't do bare minerals
face products so bummer this one is
going to cause a lot of stir and I know
it because a lot of people like lose
their mind this one is the NARS radiant
creamy concealer now before you freak
out if this is something you love I
don't not like this product but what I
don't like is that it's so expensive for
something that I think they do well in
the drugstore there are so many amazing
drugstore concealers you guys know in
fact let me pull some of these out in
the drugstore I would say one of my
favorites and I did a dupe comparison
video between this and NYX one where I
had the NARS one on one under-eye area
and then the next one on the other and I
had you guys try and guess which one was
the NARS one and which one was the NYX
and most people could not guess or they
thought of the next one was the NARS own
because it looked better this is the NYX
HD concealer that I love and they're not
the same consistency but they have the
same look in the end um so that's when I
would recommend the elf HD lifting
concealer is amazing this one you can
get I've seen them in stores that sell
elf and also online it's like a couple
dollars yep also even the Maybelline
master conceal is pretty good it's got
really high coverage there are so many
other options that are at least just as
good as this NARS one for the NARS one
to be as expensive as it is I think it's
like I don't even know it's certainly
over twenty dollars I want to say it's
closer to like thirty dollars it's too
expensive for something that runs out
too quickly you can't keep it forever
because it'll go bad and there's a ton
of great ones on the drugs my next
product that I wouldn't recommend is the
Becca low light highlight perfecting
palette this is a I don't really know
how to describe this it's their cream
products and the bronzer or the
low-light they call it is you know kind
of a thinner consistency of a cream
they're really pigmented it's not that
that's not pigmented but the highlight
one or the yeah the highlight shade is a
little bit kind of sheer which I don't
mind especially for a highlight I don't
really want but these are just kind of
hard to use I find that the low-light
one
the kind of contrary bronzer shade just
doesn't ever look right it doesn't blend
in right and then if I let it in too
much it's just gone so I haven't been
able to use this in any way that I felt
like oh wow this is worth how expensive
it is and then the highlighting one is
okay but it doesn't the way a cream
highlighter usually works like I have
the Becca full-sized
opal one that one is absolutely
beautiful this one just kind of pushes
my foundation all around so I've used it
with the Beauty Blender but the Beauty
Blender doesn't pick it up very well
because it's not like really creamy it's
kind of like rough creamy like cream to
powder so I've used stippling brushes
Beauty blenders regular brushes my
finger nothing is applying this very
well so all in all I just I feel like
you're better off with anything else
cream products I'm not a big fan of
anyway butt cream highlights I like but
I would say if you're going to spend the
money just get the full size like Becca
skin Perfector because that really is
nice this next one I'm just sad that I
gotta get rid of it all of these I'm
getting rid of this see lorac matte Pro
and it's like half the size of like the
lorac Pro palette and when I bought this
I was actually in France and I hauled it
and I was so excited because they're all
matte they're all really neutral shades
it's got a bunch of lighter ones they're
some medium ones but I am never reaching
for this ever and every time I've used
it I've had to use so many things from
other palettes that I've never felt like
oh wow this is a must-have I feel like
this needs a shade between these two
because for me in the way I always do my
eyes I always use kind of like a light
brown but it's got to be darker than
this latte one to kind of mix all the
shades together and if it's not dark
enough it just doesn't look right to me
so I haven't been able to use this in in
any great way and I'm not a big fan of
rosy tones on my
I'll do it from time to time so I'm not
really using pink mauve and burgundy
very much so I don't know and I feel
like corduroy chocolate are so close
together they could have easily made
corduroy a little lighter and then I
think this would at least be more useful
to me now I know people that if these
are shades you like you'll love this
because the formula is amazing I just
feel like I would have chosen a few
different colors it's all and you know
it's still expensive for what it is
however if these are shades you would
use this is an amazing palette so you
just kind of gotta keep that in mind
it's just my preference this one
sound the alarm because this is an
hourglass product again and this one I
bought it was like $80 and I am so
returning this
I recently hauled it in my high-end haul
that I just put up I can link below
where I got a bunch of stuff well this
is the ambient lighting edit palette and
it was only available to like VIP
members would be a baby I don't know
which level you had to be apparently I
was at that level so I was able to spend
the 80 of my own dollars to buy this and
I didn't know going in that the pans
were so small I found out like within a
day because I posted it on my Instagram
that I bought it and everyone's like oh
my gosh you're gonna be really
disappointed I was like well we'll see
so when I got it I was like okay it is
pretty small I mean these are pretty
small considering like here's the the
regular ambient lighting palette and you
can kind of see I'll try to do this
without blinding you that these are much
bigger and then of course if you get the
single ones they're even bigger but that
aside I'm just not using this enough
they have like this new shade here
that's kind of like this pinkish but it
has glitter in it which I'm not a huge
fan of um I mean I don't mind but I
don't know the plushies are really
beautiful but I think I would rather
just own one of the blushes rather than
having all of these and then this bronzy
one over here I'm just never using I
don't have a use for a shimmery bronze
on in my makeup routine I just don't and
then I already have this one in my
ambient lighting palette so all I was
using was the one I already have and
then I would just sometimes use these
blushes from
got plenty of blushes that do the same
effect and I already have the other
things so for me I'm like I just don't
if you already have this it's not worth
the money to buy this now if you don't
have any of them and you know you're
going to use the heck out of this then
maybe it is worth it if you know as I
mentioned in the haul video that there's
like one ambient powder that you're
dying to have or maybe one of the
ambient blushes just buy that one
because you'll save a little bit of
money it's still expensive but then
you'll have the one you're really going
to use because having a whole palette
like this is pointless if you know
you're only gonna use one or two of the
shades you know what I'm saying
so something to keep in mind I say to
the Box in the receipt I will be
returning this to support and I'm so
thankful they're so good with their
return policy anyway I'm gonna get my
eighty dollars back and buy another
makeup okay another disappointing
product these I bought on HauteLook
which is where I buy most of my high-end
makeup for literally half the price okay
I know I sound like an infomercial but I
love them like so much and don't they're
not sponsoring this video or anything um
so these are the soulmates bronzer
blushing bronzers they call it and I
guess they're meant to be used where you
just swirl the whole thing together and
put it on but I usually was just using
the bronzer they have this isn't a shade
karien big which is like from Sex in the
City
and then Jen love and then this is Ross
and Rachel from friends
this one's peachy this one's got the
pink the bronzers are pretty close to
each other I think Carey makes a little
warmer and this one's a little cooler
but they're not really that pigmented um
and on top of that like if you ever
wanted to just use the there it is it's
okay um if you ever wanted to just use
the blush the blushes really are not
pigmented like at all like the pink one
I can barely it's on this one it's so
hard to get anything real off like
nothing is coming off so I don't know
now spending full price on this these I
definitely would say it's not worth it
but getting them even for at the half
off price I kind of just regret buying
them because there's I don't know again
I don't have a use for this because I
don't need any more bronzers and these
aren't that
tacular and then other than that I'm
just not using them so definitely regret
okay trucking along oh this is the
benefit they're real push-up liner I got
this on Burch boxes websites I think
they have like a if you spent money on
benefit products you could get a free
gift or something and the idea it's like
this rubbery tip and you kind of twist
the product into it and it's kind of
like a gel liner which I love gel liner
but when you put it on it's like crunchy
and like giant pieces of it will come
out so it's not very controlled and
there's always like little clumps coming
out so then I'm trying to get a clump
off really carefully and then I smear it
so now I've got a whole bunch I mean
every morning I've ever used this
there's always been like devastation on
my eyelids so it's just not worth it to
me and especially for a product that is
so expensive I would rather just get my
gel liner I love the Maybelline one the
L'Oreal one the mica beauty one that I'm
using right now are mica beauty they're
amazing and then I can just use a brush
it hardly takes longer the only downside
is you have to clean your brush but I
was so excited about this because
because I travel a lot with my husband
this would be the most amazing travel
thing so I don't have to bring a
separate brush that I have to clean
every time I use it for gel liner but it
sucks I can't I just can't use anymore
all right now on to some lip regrets so
this is the Stila stay all day liquid
lipstick in the shade below seemed on
now I love and I'll even show this into
is amazing I have the same product in
the shade patina and it's this amazing
very matte it's like a mob but it's a
very deep purpley mauve it doesn't look
that deep on camera but on your lips it
really is but it's beautiful and they
drive to this amazing like satin matte
and they're comfortable on the lips ah
these are these are an amazing product
but this shade is so unbelievably light
and I have very pigmented lips so on my
lips it just looks crazy now if you have
really light lips and you know really
light peach looks amazing you will love
this because again the formula is
amazing but this looks crazy on my lips
like I have never seen anything look
crazier on my lips so I've held onto it
for a long time thinking oh maybe one
day but every time I've ever put it on
I'm like oh yeah that's why I'm not
using it because it looks insane so I'm
just gonna finally get rid of it you
guys know I've been better even though
yes I'm buying new stuff for my channel
all the time because that's my job but
I'm also getting rid of at almost the
same rate and I'm trying to be good
about it so this is me being good about
it okay the last thing I'm going to
mention that I regret buying is um the
Smashbox be legendary lipsticks I have
two shades I have one in Mandarin which
is this really cool like red orange
color but these I try to wear in a video
recently and literally I had I put liner
on my lips and then I put this on and it
just looks splotchy and that swatch
doesn't really look splotchy um like one
swipe I'm trying to get like a good one
swipe look so you can kind of see it's
not like crazy opaque right off the bat
but you can layer it to make it pretty
opaque but because it's kind of got a
wet look to a certain extent it just
made my lips look so weird and patchy
even with liner on them so I was like
okay I don't like this shade well then I
was like well this is one I had and I
actually bought this I had read reviews
on this lipstick a lot of people liked
it so I bought one of these for every
single one of my bridesmaids in this
shade and I bought one for myself too in
primers and I was so excited about
because it's the most beautiful color
now this one is better than um the
Mandarin one I think the formula of this
shade is better but even still it's got
that kind of wet look that I just don't
love on my lips I don't mind like satin
looks or if I'm intentionally wearing
gloss but for the lipstick portion of it
I want it to be pretty matte or satin
but not not really shiny so that's
something that since I'm learning that
about my
so I really just don't like it I figure
it's just time to pass these on but I
did want to tell you guys about it
before I did so those were all of the
makeup products that I wouldn't
recommend to you guys again a lot of its
based on really just my preference and a
lot of these products like the lorac
palette is actually a really good
product it's just the shade that I
didn't love the say all day liquid
lipstick same thing so keeping that in
mind I hope you enjoyed this video and I
hope it was helpful I would love to know
what products that are really expensive
that you regret buying or that you've
heard or just absolutely terrible down
below now we can all kind of read and
learn about some other products that we
wouldn't want to waste our money on
definitely if you do list some products
below give us your reasons why maybe it
does it not match with your skin type or
your skin tone or was it the formula or
the shade because I think those things
are helpful when we're all thinking
about products that we didn't like if
you enjoyed please subscribe and I can
link my other products I regret buying
video that I've done recently down below
as well and I will catch you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
