have my favorite Mac products of all
time and I am so excited to share these
with you because I've never really done
a video just dedicated to Mac products
and I feel like over the past few years
as I've you know my collection of Mac
products has really grown a lot so I've
gotten to try out a lot of new things
that I'm really excited to share them
with you guys so the first product I'm
gonna talk about are mac lipsticks I
have a few shades 3 shades to be exact
that I absolutely adore and I I just
love them so much the one I'm gonna talk
about first is my absolute favorite
which is the shade I'm wearing on my
lips which is syrup and this is part of
their luster line of lipsticks and I
just love it I'm looking at myself
because the color is so perfect
I mean it's perfect for every day you
can wear it out like it doesn't matter
you can't go wrong and it does have a
little bit of a sheen to it but I think
that just adds to the beauty of this
lipstick I love it so much and then
other lipsticks that I love from Mac
Angel is one of my favorites and it's
just a really neutral pink and I also
like cream cup now these are very very
similar cream cup is a little bit
lighter but other than that and I think
a little more like new toned whereas
angel has a little bit more color to it
but they're both absolutely beautiful
very very similar I don't think you need
both I think they're so close that I
kind of wish I had one or the other and
I think if I picked my favorite out of
the two I'd pick angel cuz it does have
just a little bit more but out of all my
MAC lipsticks syrup is my favorite
favorite favorite favorite I love it
another favorite of mine are their
blushes and I picked my favorite two
that I have one of my favorites is Dame
and it's just a beautiful light pink and
if your fair skin like me you'd like
this I think if you're if you have a
deeper skin tone I think you'll still
like it I'm not sure how it would show
up because it is a satin one but it's
not quite as glowy so I don't know if it
would show up as well but it's so
beautiful but my ultimate favorite is
Mac's full of joy and this one looks
amazing on all skin tones I'm wearing it
today and it has like a little bit of a
sheen to it you can kind of see and it's
just this beautiful like almost lilac or
lavender pink and it's just so glowy
it's hard to see in that swatch it's so
glowy and beautiful on its own and it's
a frost blush and I think that is
obviously why it's got that almost
frosty look to it but I love this year
round I think it is gorgeous every time
I wear it I get so many compliments on
it and I just love the way it looks on
my skin and these blushes last all day I
never have to reapply them they've been
without a primer or anything like that I
just don't ever have to reapply them
speaking of powders in the Mac realm of
things I love my Mac mineralize
skinfinish --is I have a natural one and
then just one of their like actual
mineralized skinfinish --is this I have
it in the shade medium which I thought
might be too dark but it's really not
because you know it's not like it goes
on crazy cakey or anything like that but
what I like about it and I'm wearing it
today is it still it mattifies but it
still let your skin breathe and that is
one thing that it's hard to find in a
powder and this one I really really like
now I don't use it everyday I usually
opt for my Rimmel stay matte so if
you're thinking about getting this but
it's kind of a high price point for you
just keep the Rimmel stay matte I really
like that and frankly I think I like it
better but I do like this one I've tried
the Mac Studio Fix powder I don't really
like that I like this a lot better but
the Rimmel stay matte it's really good
okay and the other mineralized
skinfinish I have is the classic one and
soft and gentle I'm also wearing this
today what I love about it is that it
looks it's still shimmery I mean you
there's no way around that it's
certainly
shimmery and I don't know but it doesn't
have glitter in it so your face doesn't
look glittery at all it's just shimmery
and what I love about it is again it
stays on all day you can wear it during
the day and it doesn't look crazy now
you can get a little crazy with it but
even with a medium hand it still doesn't
look crazy I really like the way it
looks I typically keep it just kind of
like above my blush not like all the way
up here all the way up here anything but
just in this region and I really like
the way that it looks on my skin I just
think it's gorgeous
I get why it's a big cult classic so
loved that one of my favorite highlights
of all time my next one
is there eyeshadow I picked out of all
my max shadows I picked my favorite five
it was really hard but I thought you
know I could show every single shadow I
have and I absolutely love all of them
but there are five that I wear all the
time so I figured those would be worth
showing you and a little more worth
worth your while so to that I have anna
duo that i've traveled with a lot which
by the way they're like duos and quads
and they're like 15 pan pallets are
really inexpensive I thought they'd be
expensive there they're really not and
it's great for traveling especially if
you buy them in the refill pan this is
the shade rice paper and it's this
gorgeous pale yellow I love wearing it
on my lid and even on my brow bone it
has a slight shimmer to it but it's not
too crazy and the fact that it's a pale
yellow makes it not come across as stark
like a stark white would so that's what
I love about it and it just it blends
together so beautifully and again that's
another shade that when I'm wearing this
I always get asked what I'm wearing on
my eyes and it's usually this I also
love Omega and this is like this light
almost taupe gray color and it's the
most beautiful buffer color between like
your brow bone and your lid you know
just to kind of fill in that crease area
and then you can use something darker in
the true crease but it's just a
beautiful buffer color ah I love it so
much it's just one of my go-to s for
that then my three others this is a new
one for me it's called floof and it's
this beautiful almost pinkish white
color I mean it's more white than
anything but it's got this like silvery
metallic pinkish tone to it to me at
least on my skin tone and it's just very
stark so if you don't like that stark
white color you probably won't love this
but it blends beautifully and sometimes
I'll blend rice paper and floof together
and that's what I did today on my lid
and I really like it it can kind of mute
itself out just a little bit but it's
still shimmery and nice so I really like
floof especially if you want something
super bright like that okay this is one
of my all-time favorites and it's in the
shade patina and it I don't even know
how to describe it it's like a goldish
bronzy taupe color and
it's so beautiful in the crease and
again it works it's like all over and
that's what I did today I didn't use
Omega I used patina and I just like the
way it looks with my skin tone I love
the way it wears throughout the day it
blends out absolutely gorgeously I just
love it I can't stop using it every day
I'm trying to branch out and do
something different and I still reach
for a patina because that's all I want
to use I mean really in my last shadow
favorite is wedge and again this is a
beautiful crease color it's a little
darker than Omega and a little more
Brown tone but I like to use it kind of
more in my outer crease and that's what
I use today as well it's beautiful and
it's not it doesn't pull too red or
anything which is what I find like I've
got soft Brown it's a beautiful color
but on me it looks really really reddish
and I don't really like that on my skin
so I don't use it as much I use wedge a
lot more so if you've tried soft brown
and you felt that it was too red try
wedge because it's a beautiful similar
tone maybe a little bit lighter but it's
not red at all another favorite are
their lip liners and I have three
favorites from them they're all very
different the one I'm wearing today
under syrup is dervish which is funny to
me because that's a nickname I have from
some friends
the d'oeuvre and dervish and dervishes
it's a long story behind it but it's
just funny to me that that's what it's
called and it's just this beautiful kind
of rosy mauve lip liner and I just like
it especially for every day it just
really will hold on to any lipstick you
put on top of it which I like and of
course it helps with the bleeding of any
lipstick so I love that color just for
everyday and then for some kind of blank
whoa colors I've got magenta which I got
at a CCO which is a cosmetics company
outlet you can find it like outlet
stores and they sell Mac products for
really cheap and this is where I got
magenta and it's this beautiful true
magenta color again you could even wear
this like color your lips in with it and
wear it under a more nude color and it
makes a really cool mixture on your lips
I've done that a few times in videos but
I just like it and it's also great of
course under these stark purplish or
dark red tones just to kind of cool it
down a little bit and then the other lip
liner favorite is beet and this one is
my go-to under any
red lipstick because it is a little bit
more blue toned like a true beet would
be the vegetable or fruit vegetable
right it's a little more blue tone which
I like because on me like a brick red
doesn't quite look as good with my skin
tone so I always opted for a more blue
tone and knowing that I have some brick
red colors this kind of cools those
brick Reds down to a more blue tone I
love it I love this lip liner another
favorite is my mac fix+
this is the only one I've owned it's the
small one I don't use it every single
day which is why I didn't want to spend
for the big one
and I would recommend that for you as
well if you don't know if you'll like
this or how it will work with your skin
or if it'll break you out
opt for the smaller when it's a lot more
inexpensive and it's still going to last
a long time same nozzle and everything
so plus you can travel with it which I
really like I think honestly if I run
out of this I might still buy the
smaller size so that I can travel with
it anyway but I love it because you can
miss it I didn't wear it today but you
can miss it all over your face
especially in the winter when your skin
gets cracked and dry this helps to kind
of just meld everything together
beautifully you can spray a ton and just
let it dry and it just holds on to your
makeup it helps it stay there all day
but it also helps to kind of blend
together any dry patches it helps I mean
it's really honestly I want to say this
is between 10 and 15 dollars and it's
well worth the money because it does a
beautiful job of that I love it in the
winter plus it adds like a dew eNOS to
your skin if you feel that you've over
mattified your face say you put too much
powder on or the foundation is really
matte that helps to kind of add some
life back into your face which I love
another Holy Grail product for me is the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer ladies this
is worth every penny I'm wearing it
today I finally got it in the right
shade in c15 I had an NC 20 it was way
too orange and way too dark for me but
NC 15 seems to be working perfectly I
not only put it right here but I end up
doing kind of that v-shape if you will
all the way out because it adds almost a
natural highlight to your skin without
having to put a shimmery highlight on it
because it's lighter than your skin tone
this blends out beautifully I use my
Real Techniques expert face brush and I
do that with my foundation and then I
use the same brush for my concealer
and I just love the way it looks it
doesn't look weird by the end of the day
it looks just like it did it's very
brightening but not like overly bright
where you look weird and normal lighting
you know like indoors I'm thinking of at
work I just think it's beautiful I
really do
the only downside is because it's a pump
you can't control how much comes out so
one pump is enough for like two to three
days of application so sometimes I'll
use like a little lid like a travel
thing and I'll use the lid in it and
squirt it in and then I'll use that for
the next like three days but I wish that
weren't the case cuz when I travel with
it which I almost always bring this with
me when I travel cuz it's my favorite
it's just tricky because of that pump so
that is announced that I wish it was
more controlled if I ruled the world
that's how that would be okay so my next
favorite are Mac Paint Pots and I have a
ton of these but I am I just narrowed it
down to my favorite three because I
realized I'm like gosh yes I have a lot
of these but I really only use these
three they are my favorite I mean I use
the others but you guys know what I mean
so the very first one I ever got was
bear study and I fell in love with the
day one and I still love it today it's
this beautiful like kind of light
champagne color and for my skin tone it
works really well I can use it all over
and then put shadow on top this one I
don't like to wear on its own because I
don't think it I don't know it does
alright on its own but it's not like
much but it's beautiful under shadow and
it really holds on to it all day the
other one this is a more recent one for
me but I love it and it reminds me of
benefits RSVP cream shadow which is one
of my favorites and it's this it's
called vintage selection and it's kind
of a more greyish champagne color and
it's got this one has actual glitter in
it which I don't love but it's just so
beautiful it doesn't matter and the
glitter doesn't go anywhere so that's
fine now if the glitter was falling all
over the place that would be very
different story I wouldn't like it but
it's so beautiful I'm wearing it under
my shadow today although I have other
shadows on comet so it's not as obvious
but I just think it's gorgeous and this
one is beautiful on its own oh my gosh
oh my gosh and then the last one the
last paper out I want to mention is
painterly this one I was nervous would
be a little dark for my skin tone so
wouldn't this is
the matte nude color at least nude for
my skintone and are you use it all over
and completely like covers almost like
concealer any veining or discoloration
you have so that way any shadow you put
on top of it is purely the color it's
supposed to be which is amazing
this is gorgeous I'd have one from Sigma
that was similar and it was just a
little bit too orange almost for my skin
tone so it was weird you could like see
the delineations no matter how much I
blended it out but this one matches
perfectly so oh my gosh I love it this
was I was so excited to get this because
it's perfect the last category I'm going
to talk about our brushes and these are
my favorites the first one I'm going to
mention is probably my ultimate favorite
brush and it's the Mac 266 brush it is a
well I use it as an eyeliner brush for
cream liner now this is I've tried so
many angled brushes for cream and gel
liner and this is the best it does the
best at flicking for like a little bit
of a wing which I have today like a
little bit of one it just it gives you
exactly what you want it doesn't go all
over the place it doesn't get weird the
more you use it because other ones I've
tried Sedona lace Sigma diva all of them
they're good but not as good as this one
so in the realm of angled brushes this
is worth every penny if you're gonna buy
one brush and you've been looking for an
angled brush that's not going to get all
messed up and then screw up your line
get this it's worth it oh my gosh oh my
gosh worth every penny
the other ones are eyeshadow brushes Mac
224 I really really like this for
getting all just tons of color in my
crease just all the way up to there just
all of it it's what I use every single
day I love to use this with my patina
eyeshadow with Omega with any of those
where it doesn't need to be precise this
is also great for blending all your
shadows together because it's fluffier
and it's bigger and I just think it's
wonderful I do however think that the
Sigma one I can't think of the number
but the Sigma one that's like this is
just as good I mean this is great but I
think you can also find cheaper
alternatives so it's kind of up to you
these are amazing this is the Mac 217
and then this is the Mac 239 there one
is just they're very similar but
the 239 is shorter and denser I use the
239 to pack on lid shadow I think it's
great it also works very well with cream
shadow which is hard to find a brush
that does well with that and I think
this does a great job and then the Mac
217 even though it is kind of fluffy and
it's not as dense I like to use it to
put a darker color on the outside of my
crease especially if it's not so dark
that it you know it doesn't have to be
perfectly precise I use this with wedge
a lot just a wedge it in my outer corner
but I really really like it a lot and I
don't really have a brush that's exactly
this shape I have one similar but not
quite the same and I really like this
one so I always buy my Mac products from
Nordstrom comm just cuz I've had some
bad experiences with ordering from the
Mac website a few times so I just have a
bad taste in my mouth about it
I always ordered them through Nordstrom
because it's free shipping all the time
which I think Mac is too but it's always
free shipping even if you only buy like
one small thing you can provide just one
shadow it's still free shipping it's
always quick shipping and I just have
always had a good experience and they're
on Ebates and right now he bakes is
doing like a double cashback and they do
that a lot especially before the
holidays but right now they're doing it
and Ulta is double percent cashback
Sephora is I think they're like now
eight percent cashback so anytime you're
ordering online I'm just like when I
order online I'm literally getting paid
to do it
awesome so Nordstrom is on that list as
well so I'm getting cash back when I
order my wrong products on there which
is why I do it but he makes and I
collaborate a lot and they were willing
to do a giveaway for you guys on my
channel with this video so I chose for 4
winners to receive the Mac syrup
