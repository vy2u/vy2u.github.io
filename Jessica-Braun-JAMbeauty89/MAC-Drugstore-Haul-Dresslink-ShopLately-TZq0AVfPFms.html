huge haul and I'm pretty sure I say that
before every haul video but looking at
all my stuff this is unbelievable and
the thing is this has been like a month
and a half of hauls but it's all so
random and you'll see what I mean so
let's just get started first things
first I finally went to a CCO
which is a cosmetics company outlet and
I've never been to one and there's one
like an hour from here and my boyfriend
and I were having we were spending a day
trip somewhere where we live and we
passed but on the way home and I was
like we have to stop it was awesome and
the best part is I was in a rut not the
best part I was in a rush because it
closed like thirty minutes later so I
was like and I was like on like I was
sweating because I was freaking out so
I'm like this is the best place ever and
only have 30 minutes so I actually
bought a lot of things first thing I
bought was the Estee Lauder Double Wear
stay in place makeup I've heard so many
rave reviews about this and I was like I
just got to try it and I think it was
like 26 dollars and I'm sure originally
it's over 40 dollars so it's pretty good
deal I got it in one see one shelf 15 it
was the lightest color they had there it
might be the lightest color in the range
but it is a perfect match for me in
whole I try not to use this every single
day it doesn't make me break out or
anything but it's just so expensive like
I don't want to run out of it so
obviously I'll use it up before it goes
bad but I don't want to use it every day
so I use it for special occasions and it
lasts all day when I put it on in the
morning and then like after school I
look in the mirror and usually no matter
what I'm wearing it's kind of broken
apart in place because I've been
sweating dealing with kids you know and
then with this when I look at myself in
the mirror I'm like it looks exactly
like it did at 6:00 in the morning
that's amazing so this stuff is
unbelievable but I don't think I can
ever bear to pay the full price
26 was still obviously that's incredibly
high even still for me so I was like but
I'm like I just want to try it so glad I
did okay another thing I picked up there
was this Smashbox gel eyeliner or cream
eyeliner and caviar which is black
basically and it's just the standard
Smashbox ah packaging doesn't matter I
don't like it at all
I regret purchasing it it was I think it
was only ten dollars so it wasn't that
big of a deal but still like that
sometimes I couldn't put towards like a
lipstick or something and it just
doesn't stay on smudges on me I don't
know what it is about my eyelids it's
not black as black like the L'Oreal one
that I love is way better the Maybelline
one is way better so like man so I guess
lesson learned not a big fan of that the
rest of the products I got at the CCO
were Mac products so I got this lip
liner in magenta which is just their
typical but it's a really pretty I just
think it's such a pretty it looks like
the my shirt the color of my shirt so I
was really excited to get this and then
I also got blush I didn't guess there I
got two Mac blushes if you will this one
is full of joy and it's the prettiest oh
my gosh I was so excited to get this it
is the prettiest like lilac color it's
such a pretty spring color is it not oh
my gosh it's just so pretty and for I'm
really fair skin so it's I think I just
really like the way it shows up on my
skin I also got two MAC lipsticks I got
viva glam Nikki which is this really fun
bright like kind of creamy coral color
and then in the packaging of course is
that fun with the red and then I also
got Saint Germain and that's just a true
like Barbie pink I think oh my gosh I
think these are so pretty I've been
wearing st. germain and some recent
videos actually because I've had this
cut for a while but I wanted to haul it
all together and actually have more
stuff coming the mail I'm like I should
have waited I'm like I can't wait any
longer this stuff's been like I've been
using it but it was hard to like keep a
list so I can make sure I got everything
back together another thing I got was
that it's a powder blush but it's a
bronzer shade it's in the shade taupe
shape kind of like top shape and it's a
really perfect bronzer color or actually
I would say more contour color for
someone that's fair like me it reminds
me of my favorite pic c1c yeah it
doesn't really show up in swatches very
well I can try
you can kind of see it for someone if
you're fair-skinned and you can find
this it's perfect but it's not part of
the regular collection at least I
checked and I didn't find it so it might
be hard to find you might want to look
at a CCO near you and see if they have
it but I really like it I also got a Mac
product separate from the CCO I just
ordered this because I've been wanting
it
it's the Mac Paint Pot and bear study I
have been using this so much it's just a
really pretty kind of everyday shimmery
color it when you first swatch it when
you first put it on it's like whoa but
as you blend it it just ends up being
the prettiest pearlescent base it's not
too much it holds onto shadow all day I
was so impressed better than any cream
shadow I've used so far so really really
liked that I might get another one soon
because I just love it and I love the
way it ends up looking all day speaking
of so moving away from the CCO I bought
a lot of things on HauteLook and
different installments and that if you
know anything about look you know that
it can take like four weeks to finally
get an item sometimes longer a lot of
you guys have commented telling horror
stories about hope look and I know
because I mean and I that's just the way
they work it lets you know that it
usually will take you know two to four
weeks to actually ship it but sometimes
it takes longer than that and it's so
frustrating anyway but I can't really
complain because I'm like the deals are
just so good but anyway finally got this
when urban decay was on there I bought
the full size primer potion in greed and
it's an you know they're newer packaging
it's not that old one and it's this
really pretty gold primer if I can get
it out of here and it is certainly you
can see it right there it's certainly
gold like it's so pretty I will say
though if I compare this as a primer to
the Mac Paint Pot the Mac Paint Pot I
think last longer but I do really like
this but I like to paint pop better but
I'm glad I bought it and again on there
I think it was like eight or ten dollars
so way cheaper than the original price
of that moving on
so I also placed some orders on Sephora
I was needing a new cleansing oil
because I tried the Garnier one and I
wasn't a big fan of it it's a
okay but the Garnier Garnier has a new
one out if you don't know and I wasn't
that big of a fan of it but I really
like the Josie Maran Argan cleansing oil
but it's pretty expensive I ended up
getting the Bosch of makeup breakup
cooling cleansing oil now this one is
also still expensive I think it was a
little bit cheaper than the full-size
Josie Maran one buff of course that has
a pump and it smells really nice I don't
really know how to describe this smell I
can't get it open
smells really nice it feels good it
hasn't broken me up I also ordered the R
Nastasia brow Wiz pencil in medium ash
and I know they just redid their shape
names this is perfect for my eyebrows
that's it right there it's perfect if it
doesn't pull red at all I love it it
lasts all day your brows will look
amazing all day I'm just so impressed
this bully that comes on the other side
this is worth every penny and it's one
of those products that's been on my wish
list forever I finally bit the bullet
and I'm like why didn't I do it sooner
because I love their brow powder but it
takes longer to apply this is
unbelievable I will pay the 23 dollars
or $18 I don't even know how much this
is whatever it is every single time
because it will always be worth it
because I've never found a pencil that
works so well and on top of that it is
so much quicker to do I'm just so I'm
just like shaving like three minutes off
my time which I mean time is precious in
the morning
the other thing I finally brought is the
bare minerals well rested concealer and
just because I've heard so many people
talk about it I really really like good
stuff you can use it without any
concealer and it conceals that area it's
unbelievable you can even use this to
like highlight areas if you want that
you know you don't want to shimmer there
but I'll use it here and even bring it
out here this stuff is unbelievable
like these two products I'm so glad that
I finally bit the bullet because they've
been in my cart for like a million years
on my wish list and I finally did it and
I am ecstatic over them cuz they're
unbelievable and like this I am never
gonna run out of this it's way bigger
than what I thought it was okay drug
store let's do it I got a lot of things
from the drugstore makeup wise so one of
the things I finally found was the wet
and wild walking walking the red carpet
eight pan palette and they're around
five dollars and really I was excited
about because I saw let me get the brush
out of here all these really cool shades
especially at this gold well guess what
the gold is weird
and chunky like crazy chunky it's it
gets all over the place that's that's it
they're sorry weird swatch location I
don't end up using the shimmery shades
at all they're really chalky and just
kind of but this shade here you can see
I use a lot this is the perfect crease
shade for me now if you're darker than
me it's it's gonna be too light it might
be a nice lid but for me you see it in
the truck
it's the perfect very subtle crease
shade for every day I've been grabbing
this palette for that color every day
for the past like three weeks I can't
stop using it because it doesn't pull
red it's just the perfect cool
barely-there crease color do you know
what I mean also a great buffer color
between even if you are doing a more
colored look like I did I use it today
no I didn't but I love this just for
that I kind of just want a deep pot just
that shade and I don't care about
anything there's just that one just want
that one if the awesome if wet and wild
came out with that one and single all I
would lose my mind anyway speaking of
that color NYX is now carried at Meijer
near me and I about lost my mind and
actually now the targets near me finally
have NYX as well but I bought this
single Nick shadow and SOS for that sole
purpose of like just like this color
here I wanted it for a light subtle
crease shade and this does a pretty good
job of it it's a really it's a little
bit a little bit more pigmented a little
deeper but it's a just a really pretty
topi gray shade I love it it really has
been working well it's adorable
packaging with a little bow I mean come
on so cute
now I also finally bought one of the
master highlight blushes from Maybelline
I wasn't gonna do it for the longest
time and finally I was like I just wanna
try it I just want to know because
everyone was saying it's just beautiful
it is a beautiful glow it's just the
prettiest this is in the pink rose shade
I'm running out of room I need to wipe
this stuff off weird swatch place that's
it there but I just it's just one of
those like it makes me think of spring
now and what's kind of fun is when I
bought this it was starting to feel
nicer here so now I like equate that in
my mind with nice weather so if this
blush just makes me very happy I really
like it I haven't tried the other shades
I probably won't because how many
blushes do I need not as many as I have
I know that much but I'm glad I did buy
this because it's really pretty and it
lasts all day for real ladies it
actually lasts all day I also bought
this NYX pale pink lip liner and I was
buying it because I was trying to I want
Mac dervish and because it I've heard
that it's really good under like nude
lip colors to make it look a little more
alive and I just heard it's just a great
color to have in lip liner and I don't
have one like that so I thought this
might be a good dupe for it that's it
right there
however it looks really pigmented nice
here when I put it on my lips
this almost mutes out my lips completely
and I'm like nah but there's another
color in the NYX line and I can't think
of it's not pale pink but it's something
pink that's supposed to be an even
better dupe for it
but I'm kind of thinking I might just
stop and just actually buy the back one
because that's the one I want and
coincidentally enough a nickname that
has been given to me from some friends
of mine and my boyfriend calls me at
2:00 sometimes is d'oeuvre or the
d'oeuvre order v order they're delicious
and I don't even know where it came from
it doesn't really make any sense but I
do know it's so funny that that make Mac
lip liners called dervish and I just
feel like I should own it don't you
anyway alright so I have got a bunch of
drugstore lipsticks that I haven't
bought drugstore lipstick in what seems
like forever I bought one of the
collection purvey Prive I don't know how
to say from L'Oreal and this is free
does nude and to be honest I bought it
like looking at the picture I'm like
first of all Frieda is just beautiful
they're all those ladies are beautiful
but I was so torn but I was like you
know what I want to get the one like she
is nothing like my skin type and part of
me was like I kind of want to try it
just to see because it's like the one I
would assume would not work for me and
so I figured why not try it just see
what happens you know what I'm saying
this is actually a really cool lip color
on me I think it looks really not again
that might be the weirdest swatch
location of all time but I think it's
just such a fun color that and by fun I
mean it's super muted but it's a color I
would never have picked in any other
circumstance so I'm kind of glad I did
and I don't have one like as my
collection so I've been enjoying wear it
and I have a feeling I'm gonna get a lot
of wear out of this come fall isn't that
a really nice fall nude and it's just
different that I would usually use so
I'm really excited hate the smell hate
the smell oh my gosh and I was watching
eleventhgorgeous this morning actually
while I was getting ready and I don't
member what video but they were talking
about lipsticks and they were talking
with the Laureus mom like yep agreed
wholeheartedly
I almost hate even opening I hate this
phone they've always found like that I
wish they would change that so other
drugstore lipsticks I got two of the
Kate Moss Rimmel lipsticks and I think I
owned one of these a long time ago and I
got rid of it and I don't know why but I
just I don't know they're cute and I
wanted to try them again because they
were on sale this is in I'm gonna have
to do it on my other hand hold on that
means I might have to draw with my left
hand I don't know if I can do this
that's 0-5 okay and this is this is hard
to do okay so this 1:05 and that is 17
aren't those beautiful colors now
oops I'm getting it on my hand one of
these is from the matte collection I
think maybe not I don't remember no
maybe not I don't know regardless
they're really inexpensive and they feel
really moisturizing in their beautiful
colors and they had a lot of juice from
one course now I have worn both of these
and I will say that the wear time is not
awesome like I would say it starts to
get kind of weird after like - honestly
on my lips like after an hour so this is
one that you'd you will have to reapply
or at least put something over at
something but and if you put a lip liner
under it they last longer but not super
long-lasting
my opinion now another weird product
that I got is from wet and wild and it's
wet wild by Fergie
it's her vicious varnish high shine lip
stain it looks like this I'm not sure
that that's focusing I don't think it is
it doesn't really matter the color is
like unbelievable right this is in the
shade Street Queen now no let me just
show you this it's no it's see it's not
doing it any justice this is like the
weirdest goofiest just goopy I mean it's
just goopy if you watch my FC versus
Birchbox know if C vs boxycharm for
April there's an offer a lip color that
I got in my Ipsy bag that reminded me of
this it's just not the color but the
formula it's just a really goopy lip
lacquer varnish you know it's not quite
a lip gloss and this is the prettiest
color but it wears off in the weirdest
way like I wouldn't buy another one of
these that's what I'll say now I have
worn this over like Saint Germain
which is like that bright Barbie pink
and it looks really great but after an
hour this gets really weird not even an
hour like 20 minutes so I really
wouldn't recommend it I love the color
and I wish it was better but nah it's
just bizarre
I really wouldn't let me go like these
swatches off okay so I also place
another order with HauteLook for terena
Tarantino Tino Tarantino Tarantino
products and I was drawn to them because
I've heard people talk about them but
not a lot of people and the deals were
pretty good especially since this is
high-end makeup and so one of the things
I got was they're dull skin eye primer
and it's just in the most adorable
packaging just with pink and little bows
I'm not sure if it's focusing as usual
but it's just a doe foot applicator and
it's just a nude color see it blends
right in with my skin it's okay I've
only tried it once or twice so I really
don't know how I feel about it yet but I
think this was really like four or five
dollars it was not expensive at all I
also got the doll skin cheek palette and
it is
this oh my gosh just look at those
colors come on how could I not and I
think this was like twenty dollars but I
was like you know what that's $5 per
blush if you don't have a big blush
collection you're trying to expand this
would be a great way to do it it's kind
of all-in-one and they're just such
beautiful colors and super super super
super creamy and pigmented I mean these
are gorgeous they really they really
really are I just love them so I was
really excited about getting this
finally and the last thing I got from
her was this is one of my favorites I've
been using this all just for weeks it's
her idream highlight duo so it's two
different shadows in Jasper and a got a
and it is these two colors are the most
beautiful lid colors I've ever seen
look at that those are them there oh my
gosh they're both so beautiful again why
did I swatch those in such a weird place
it's those two right there oh I just
love them and the packaging is just
adorable oh my gosh everything about it
this makes me the next time she goes on
HauteLook this makes me want to get more
of these duo's but really I don't think
any will compare to these two colors
because they're exactly what I love
exactly and they last all day all day
okay so I went to Big Lots of course I
did and I got some masks and these are
the FEL facial essence masks there's $2
hello phone for I think four of them my
mom and I tried them actually we were
having like a girls night last week and
we tried them so I've tried them I've
said that 10 times what am I talking
about they broke me out so bad like
literally the next day it felt really
great on my skin it really did it was
cooling it felt really moisturizing but
the next day I it was like instant
breakouts oh it was so so bad it was
really really bad and I'm just so sad I
guess I'm like me and if these are
awesome like they're so inexpensive and
but no I'm gonna have to give these away
I might giving to my sister and see if
she because my mom was fine of course
she's all
Mayans were skins maybe not as prone to
breakouts as mine is especially right
now so I don't know but really really
sad about that because I was excited to
try them another thing that I got didn't
get some Oh another thing I got at Big
Lots you guys are gonna be like of
course you did of course you did Jessica
I got a Mickey Mouse so when you're
drinking he's just like facing you oh my
gosh and look at this is my favorite
face this one right here where he's like
laughing this was like three dollars
like literally three dollars at Big Lots
so yeah focus on me there you go yeah
like so inexpensive how could I not get
it let's be real of course I bought it
now on HauteLook I also got this watch
that I absolutely adore it's this if the
Brandon is Bergy or Burgi and it's just
this tan and gold watch its kind of
see-through
it's originally as I go $500 watch or
something dumb like that I could never
in a million years afford and would
never in a million years pay like a 500
watch but I think I got it for like 75
and I had some site credit so I didn't
have to pay for all of that out of
pocket but it was still I mean even if I
had paid this $75 that's it's a really
nice watch the band I don't really know
how to describe what it's made of but
it's this really cool material and it's
got genuine leather on the back and it's
just really really high-quality it
matches everything and I was just so
excited to get just a nude colored watch
so very happy with that purchase like I
have so much stuff still the show this
is insane so on birch box's website
which all have links for all of the
things that I've been mentioning down
below or at least all the websites at
least I was buying some things just on
their websites because sometimes they'll
have good deals on things and plus I was
just I had a few points to use and I was
like well and then I ended up of course
using more than what my points were for
but oh so one of the things I got was
the Kota Leo de beauté a cuz it looks
so dark it's see-through just looks
start because I'm behind it I guess but
this stuff has this what yeah like a
lemon smell it surprised me the first
time I sprayed it but it's just this
really refreshing mist it really feels
so nice it helps like if you've got
dryness going on it just helps to
moisturise just a little bit or
throughout the day you can put it on
before makeup after makeup sometimes
I've used it like once or twice after
school just like I'll have this in my
person just in my car just spray it just
to revitalize my face you know
especially when you're in a building
where there's heat going on you know and
it's drying your skin out this is a
great way to just add that moisture back
in so I was really glad to have that
finally and then I also got a 2-pack of
the Beauty Blender on there I want to
get the black ones but they were sold
out when I was getting them I feel like
the black probably not I was gonna say
maybe the black will show the foundation
a little less but probably not because
I'm thinking it'd be liars so it doesn't
matter but I also purchased that's what
it was I don't have it with me to my
bathroom but the solid Beauty Blender
cleanser I also bought that and oh my
gosh that stuff gets everything out of
everything I've used it for my Beauty
Blender it gets this stuff out of it
right away
well I've used it on my brushes
especially my Sigma ones where there's
the white on top and it like never seems
to get fully clean when I deep clean it
with that it's like back to its original
glory
it is amazing again worth every penny
I'm like what are they gonna get a
really good drugstore dupe for that
because I tried like doves soap and it
doesn't do as well as that does I've
tried course baby shampoo and things
like that but oh my gosh the Beauty
Blender solid was like unbelievable
so I'm excited about that I also bought
some things at shop lately calm one of
my original pranksters I've loved it for
oh so long so this is from a few
different sellers one of them is this
bracelet it looks like the bauble bar
bracelets and there's a million others
that make this but these really pretty
balls this was like ten dollars it was
not and it's really heavy it feels very
high quality I was I kind of expected to
get it and I was like it was only ten
dollars it's gonna be kind of and no
this is like super heavy like really
just absolutely gorgeous oh my gosh just
gorgeous I was so impressed with the
quality so definitely check these this
website because everything I get from
there is awesome I also bought from shop
lately some headband
they're like those you know like the
Kitsch ones or any of that kind where
they're like tied elastic but these are
actual headbands instead of just hair
ties and I've been using this when I
have been running outside because you
know your hair flies in your face and
these I got like this little pink and
white polka dotted one the green and
white chevron I also got some animal
print ones that kind of match with my
hair a little bit more and they of
course that plane color once these were
only like for a two-pack I think it was
like four or five dollars but they're
really well made sometimes you get these
and they're kind of they'll like untie
that happened to me the other day I'm
like are you serious like the first time
I use it just untied I'm like what what
what anyway but you can always make
these two if you buy the elastic but I'm
just lazy and I just rather just buy
these but they actually stay put like
when I'm running and I have my hair
pulled back it actually stays in place
it doesn't start riding and then like
fall off you know what I mean they
actually stay in place so I was excited
about that another thing I got was
another hair like oh oh I also got some
regular hair ties from them but look at
these is that not beautiful the white
and the gold and then black I got like a
pack of four for a couple bucks on shop
lately and then I also got this not I
don't want to say turban it's not a
turban it's like a hair or a headband
but it's got like the knot here see how
its knotted up they had a ton of these
not quite sure how I'm gonna wear yet
but I thought it was really cute again
it was like a couple bucks and it's
really really nice material and then the
last thing I got were sunglasses and
these were like ten dollars I really
like them because they just have a
really simple added metal detail here
and that's it there's nothing crazy
about it I like that it doesn't have any
of the like metal things here in the
center because then when I you know like
have my hair like this it doesn't get
caught in it I can pull it out easily
you know what I mean so I was really
excited about these I think I've had
this exact style before in brown and I
broke them and I was so sad so I was
excited to see them on the side again
for like nine or ten bucks so love the
simple sunglasses and oh oh my gosh how
could I forget one of the most exciting
things to show you guys is this from
this website called dress link calm and
I'll link it below
and they contacted me and said hey do
you want um we'd love for you to feature
our site and I was like I don't know I
don't really feature clothing sites and
of course I'm always honest with you
guys when I get anything for free or
sent to me and I'm also gonna be honest
about whether or not I like it so here's
what I picked out so I'll show you my
favorite first because this shirt oh my
gosh it's just polyester and it's got
these gold details and it's a long
sleeve just kind of lose shirt I wore it
the other day and I got so many
compliments on it I mean so many and
it's just a very flattering fit I was so
surprised and this all their stuff is
like six bucks I'm like what like I
think this shirt is literally like 559
but huh like it doesn't make sense it
really didn't make any sense but that's
really how much it was and then another
thing I picked out was this like kind of
party dress cuz I really don't have many
and it's got this gold like strapless
part that sits there and then this mesh
part goes up and it's just a
form-fitting black short dress and I
just thought was really pretty and fun
and this was only like I think like
eight dollars like what and it actually
feels really well-made same with the
white shirt now another thing that feels
really well-made that I picked out I
might wear at graduation is this just
simple polka dotted white and black
dress it's got little cap sleeves and a
really cute little collar and it's kind
of cinched here it's a little loose on
me here but I think I might put a belt
like a black belt around or maybe some
different color anyway and it's got like
a slit built-in it's really really nice
and I think this one was a haul of these
were under $10 and that one seems really
really well-made now this one wasn't
quite exactly like the picture it's just
a long-sleeved sure it's made of cotton
and it kind of ties off to the side
really cute and the girl wearing it in
the picture oh my gosh it was adorable
but it was just the way it looked I
thought it'd be a little it's not like
it's not well made because it actually
is but it just wasn't quite what I
expected I guess I'll say so that was
kind of a disappointment but I haven't
got to wear it yes so but I have tried
it on the only disappointing one and I
was really sad because I was really
excited about this was this what am I
talking about
and it ties here it's a classic
trenchcoat but it's short and really
cute and girly and in the picture if you
see it you'll be like oh my gosh it's
like stupid cute perfectly fitted
perfectly fitted but they only have like
the small says they have was a medium
which the sizes aren't quite the same as
they are in America I mean you know but
it's way too big on me like way too big
but I was so shocked because look how
cute the pockets are here like a little
almost like bows and I was just really
really sad because it's huge on me my
only thought is maybe I could resew the
buttons cuz when I button it it's too
wide so maybe I could take these buttons
and put them here so that I can close it
a little closer I don't know I was
really sad and I will say this is
thinner than I thought it would be it
wasn't quite as thick or well made but
you know I was planning on using this
for a spring jacket so it's not like it
would be I don't really need it to be
really thick I think I'd rather it be
thin and I do actually need a spring
jacket so I might adjust the buttons and
see I don't know but that was really the
only disappointment everything else is
freaking amazing and like that white
shirt I wish I had it in every color I
could wear it every single day ah I just
love it and it's so flattering but again
cheap prices definitely check it out
because I was astounded and they they
had so much clothing to choose from like
I literally could have looked at that
website for like hours and hours and
hours and I it would have been
impossible to narrow down so well anyway
wow this is a long enough video I think
that's all show I have my elf stuff here
but I've already kind of shown all my
elf collection including these new
products in my elf collection like best
and worst video that I'll link it below
but regardless so you'll get to see that
stuff sooner or later but anyway I hope
that was fun to watch and there's
certainly a lot of great products out
there and luckily I've gotten to try a
lot of these before speaking about them
so it kind of worked out well but anyway
I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
