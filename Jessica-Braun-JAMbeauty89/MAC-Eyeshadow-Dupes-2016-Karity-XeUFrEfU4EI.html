going to be sharing with you 16
different mac eyeshadow dupes
now all of my dupes are from a brand
called caridy and they're actually
sponsoring this video I'm always really
open with you guys when I'm being
sponsored this is actually really
exciting for me because as I've been
trying out the carroty eyeshadows versus
the map ones I realized that the blend
ability is the same the pigmentation is
the same and in some cases the
pigmentation of the carotene eyeshadows
are actually better and on top of that
of course they're way cheaper and that's
the idea of a dupe so the carroty
eyeshadows that I'm going to show you
they're all five dollars and fifty cents
now Mac eyeshadows in the regular pot
are sixteen dollars and the Mac
eyeshadows that come like this are 10
which is so almost double the carroty
eye shadow price you can buy carroty
eyeshadows brushes etc on their website
which I will also link below so today
I'm going to be sharing with you
swatches of all 16 Mac shadows with the
carroty dupe that I have and also one of
my eyes today is done with the Mac
shadows and one of them is done with
carroty shadows and I would love to see
what your guess is down below and I will
let you know at the end of the video
which one is which so let's go ahead and
get into it
so as you can see a lot of these are so
incredibly closed
they're also pigmented which is just
insane and they have even more dupes on
their website I can link below the PDF
of the kind of master list of dupes that
they have and I I wanted to get even
more but I was like okay I gotta like
cut it off at some point because I've
already got enough but there are so many
so if you know like you've been wanting
to try all that glitters or rice paper
I'm thinking of some of my favorites or
Omega is one of my favorites of Mac they
have their counterparts that are just as
good and in some cases even better that
you can save I mean you can almost get
three for the price of one actually you
can which is incredible or two for the
price of one if you're just getting it
in the in the little pan I mean you can
save so much money get the same look the
same payoff and I just feel like you
know part of my channels goal is to help
you guys see what drums store or cheaper
options are out there that are just as
good if not better than really expensive
really high-end ones and this is kind of
what I'm doing in this video so I will
have a list of all the Mac shadows in
the dupe names from caridy down below as
well in the order that i swatched them
in case you're wanting to buy some and
you forgot which one of course you can
rewind as well Kerry also has really
good dupes for Sigma brushes I will also
these are all the carroty brushes that I
own and I've been using these and
they're incredible I will link the two
sets that I have as well they don't shed
at all they're really really soft
they're the same shapes and sizes that
Sigma has and again they have kind of a
dupes list that I'll link as well below
the PDF of the comparison chart but um
you know you guys can save money and I
feel like for brushes you can get really
nice brushes especially these for way
cheaper than the Sigma ones and it's
kind of one of those things if you're
already gonna place an order for a
couple of eyeshadows you might as well
throw a couple really awesome brushes in
as well so let's talk about my eyes
right now this one is Mac this one is
caridy did you guess right I'm curious
so I'm going to tell you kind of what I
did I don't typically do
tons of tutorials on ilex and my channel
but I wanted to share with you at least
what I did for this what shadows I use
so I used moonshine from caridy on this
I all over the lid which is a dupe for
nylon from Mac on this lid and then on
top of that I actually put because
that's a really kind of like really
you're a desert color I put trial from
caridy on this side which is a dupe for
all that glitters on this side and then
in my crease I started with I actually
use a lot of shadows because I was just
like having fun with blending and stuff
I used super freak from Keira D in my
crease and then wedge in my crease over
here that's what the dupe is and then I
kind of blended that out with Omega from
Mac which is Beijing which is well it's
Beijing which like the color beige but
it's Beijing that's cute anyway to kind
of blend it out because it's a little
bit of a softer color to help blend it
up towards my brow bone and then I used
in my crease just the outer corner to
kind of darken it a little bit I used
unspoken from caridy which is a dupe for
Brune from Mac just on the outer corner
there and then I used the Beijing and
Omega one to blend that as well and then
on my lower lash line I use vino which
is a beautiful dupe for sketch from Mac
on my lower lash line just on the outer
area and I just kind of smudged it and
it smudged beautifully and then I
blended all of my shadows together with
birthday sweet like soot but it's sweet
which is a dupe for Brule for Mac just I
used it under my brow bone kind of
packed on and then I blended everything
together with it since it's a matte nude
color so as you can see and I'm kind of
looking in my near here too
I cannot tell the difference and that's
me being very real with you guys you
don't have to spend that much money I
mean okay even if I spent $10 per matte
shadow so even if I didn't spend the
$16.66 550 that's $88 vs. $160 so it is
literally just about half the price and
you get just as many colors you can get
30
new colors from caridy and pay the same
as just sixteen colors for mac you know
what I mean so you can get a lot you can
fill a pallet you cannot tell the
difference the pans are the same size so
any palette you have that would fit fit
a Mac Shadow would fit the caridy
shadows as well I will have the look
that I'm wearing on my eyes listed below
like how I applied it if you're curious
and you're wanting to try it yourself
other than that I hope you enjoyed this
video and that you'll check out some of
my other cheap drugstore dupe videos
which I can link down below and also up
there and I will catch you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
