it's kind of a haul it's what's in my
Ipsy bag for the month of January and
then also at all I think I have good
reasons for all these purchases though
so and most of them I got really good
Dion or it's a brand new product that I
want to review for you guys so um okay
we'll start with the Ipsy bags it always
comes in the pink little thing I'll have
the link down below if you're interested
to join it's $10 a week and I have to
admit right off the bat I really was not
impressed with this week's thing and of
course it's only $10 so it's not like
it's the biggest loss in the world but
I'm like there are so many subscription
services and I don't know I'd rather
spend my $10 elsewhere but that being
said he had to take that with a grain of
salt because every other month before
this has been awesome so this is like
the first dud month in a long time for
me the bag I don't know what is the
theme it says 19 reasons 2014 will be
amazing and it I don't really know why
19 if you know why it's 19 reasons let
me know because I'm curious I don't know
if it's because they have 19 oh they
have 19 companies that they're that I
don't know who cares the bag it's I
don't really like it it's okay so first
thing it comes with is these absolute
makeup cleansing tissues there's ten of
them it looks like they are they're
pomegranate extract I have I've actually
stopped using makeup wipes not stopped
using them let's be real I'm just
haven't been using in the past couple
weeks and the ones I've usually used
I've at Big Lots they're the FPL brand
but I'd be curious to try these I'm
always leery though because I've been
known to break out from different makeup
wipes so but I've been using cleansing
oils lately so I don't know we will see
okay so another thing came with was this
mica beauty
it's a tinted lip balm and CIN number 5
natural it's just this quite natural
color you'll see a swatch that's it
there that's pretty I don't know with my
actually that might you guys
kind of like a rosy neutral and it feels
really soft and lightweightt which is
always nice and a lip balm of course so
I'm actually really excited to try that
out and let's see it also came with this
nourish organic lightweight moisturizing
face lotion these are always nice to try
and travel with of course again I'm
leery to travel with something I've
never tried but if you've tried it a few
times and you like it it's the perfect
size to travel with so that is nice
I'm trying to stop saying um I know a
lot of you guys twin doubt that I say
I'm a lot and I don't think I had
realized how much I said um except for I
say it all the time and I've already
said a lot of this video I'm sure so I'm
trying to catch myself it's a good thing
to practice also it came with this yeah
be natural finish the liquid foundation
in the shade buff it's just a small
little size which is nice to try it out
I have a feeling however that it will be
too dark for me oh I could maybe make it
work it's not too bad it's it's okay I
mean I feel like I could make it working
at least try it out and then if for some
reason I love the for me I could get the
right shade it's not that far off but it
is a little too dark
we'll see and then the last thing it
came with was this Coastal Scents brush
and it is their classic small foundation
brush I never really used brushes like
this for foundation in fact I usually
give them away it's certainly really
soft I said um I don't know I don't even
know if I'll use it I might just give it
to a friend because I just really I
really just don't use them for anything
if you've got a good use for them that
you use it like that all the time let me
know because I've never really liked the
way those types of brushes apply
foundation or concealer or anything like
that so that was everything that came in
the empty bag I don't think I ever would
have purchased any of those things on my
own
maybe the meat gets into lip balm maybe
hold on okay so that was everything that
came in that it was really kind of a dud
but of course I'm gonna keep it because
if see every other month has been
awesome so it's not that a you do okay
so I also have some stuff that I got
from Matt
I ordered online actually and then some
stuff I bought at CVS except for one of
the items okay there's a lot of goodies
here okay so the thing I'm wearing I'll
do the maps up versus what I'm wearing
my lips is actually just a lip liner it
is the Mac lip liner in beat B eet I'll
swatch it even though you can see it on
my lips um it's right there it's just a
nice like kind of a cool toned red which
I really really like it's certainly dark
for me but I think it's kind of fun and
I think this is a good time of year to
wear something like this so there's that
and then I also bought the mac fix+ I
bought it in this smaller like ten
dollar size just because I've never used
it before and I don't want to buy the
big one for twenty dollars or however
much it is and then not like it or maybe
it makes me break out but I've used it a
few times this week since I got it and I
I think I do like it my skin is felt
very kind of radiant but not like greasy
I don't know how it's looking right now
on camera but of course I applied this
that early this morning so so the other
thing I bought from Mac was their Pro
Longwear concealer I finally caved
because I've heard so many wonderful
things about this of course it's been
around for quite a while but I got in
the shade NC 20 which I really like
because I didn't want it to be too light
on my under eye that it looks really
light you know what I mean because I'm
just not into that especially when I'm
talking to people in person I don't know
I'm just it's just not my a-game they're
so NC 28025 noticed but I'm kind of
experimenting different ways to apply it
and every way I've applied it so far
I've really liked so this stuff is I
really really like it like it is worth
the money so far out of all those things
that's certainly worth the money the
other thing I bought now I'm curious if
you guys know cuz I haven't done
research yet because I haven't really
had time the covergirl trublend
foundation that just came out in the
like brownish packaging kind of well
they used to have the covergirl trublend
and it was in this packaging and I
bought this for $2.49 at CVS the other
day because it was like on sale and then
this was
Clarence and CBS was on sale something
like that so it was like 75% off or
something crazy so I literally got for
like two thousand fifty cents and I know
that there's different shade names and I
was looking at the new covergirl
trublend and he was saying if you used
to be say like shade for ten in true
blend and this you'll be l2 or whatever
it was so I'm wondering if it's the same
formula - I'm assuming that it is
because that's kind of you know makeup
companies do that all the time
but for two bucks I you can't really
beat it and there's a punk love that
it's the perfect shade for me I've only
worn it a few times so I'm not really
sure exactly how I feel about it yet but
I liked it I actually think I did like
it it I had to set it with powder for
sure but I liked it and it was a right
shade for me so so far so good because a
lot of foundations I have right now
alright they're just too greasy on my
skin I just need to get rid of them or
there's not enough coverage for most
days or I just don't like them or
they're the wrong shade okay I bought
okay this is I'm really excited about
this one the wet and wild one of their
new 5 pan palettes it's in the naked
truth don't mind my nails you guys I
really need to paint them this has been
a really rough day for me my car broke
down and it was snowing outside it has
not been a good day so I'm like going
through some stuff today but so if I
seem scatterbrained it's because I
absolutely am so it comes with these
colors and they're so pretty this one
here my nails are so bad I know you guys
these are gorgeous my only gripe now
it's really inexpensive I'll just show
you four of them it's really inexpensive
it's 399 for this at least at the CVS
that I brought it up and those are some
of them right there it's 399 there's
five shades they're great
the only gripe I have is this shade here
the crease shade is glittery and it
ended up getting glitter all down here
so even I've now tried it putting my eye
makeup on before foundation in after in
either way I ended up with glitter so I
think it would just fall out even just
from as the day wore on just fall out so
but what I've been doing and I'm wearing
it on my eyes today actually what I've
been doing is using all the other shades
and just not this one I didn't really
miss it that much anyway so
I really really love these two shades
here these three actually I've been
wearing a lot so on me I have this on
today on the outer outer outer what am I
saying okay let's do this that middle
dark shade is on my outer corner there
if you can see it that like taupe ish
color is kind of all over in the crease
and then this one is up in my brow bone
and on my lid there so pretty simple
really inexpensive it comes with their
little brushes which I usually don't use
but hey they work in a pinch so that's
always a nice option to have but like I
said that was called the naked truth and
it was 399 and I was a big deal they had
other colors but this is the only one I
was really drawn to of course I was it
was neutral so of course I was drawn to
that one okay I also got the covergirl
what are these the lip perfection ones
it's in the shade eternal it actually
reminded me a lot of this and in my last
video a lot of people asked what I was
wearing on my lips is this I'm gonna
actually swatch it next to this one's a
little bit more blue toned this is the
lipstick there that was the lip liner
that I'm wearing all over my lips today
from Mac but that's the lipstick I
really really like it it's kind of
doesn't make your teeth look yellow in
fact I think it makes them look even
whiter and I just like this one is the
first covergirl one I've bought of this
line and I really liked it and I got it
because it was on clearance the shade
was so I got these two together that
true blend as well so I also Rimmel was
buy one get one 50% off at CVS so I
bought two of their show off lip
lacquers or apocalypse depending on what
country you live in
so I got them in the shade but alright
said again I bought it in the shade Nova
now these I didn't realize I hadn't
really watched reviews on them until
after I bought them because I it's a
long story but anyway this is Nova here
these are not lip glosses I don't know
why I thought they were lip glosses but
they're actually more like lip creams if
you will you know they call it a lip
lacquer but I to me it's like a lip
cream which is probably the same thing
so this I've clearly gotten into these
more red shades here this is a
apocalypse and this is Nova I really
like both of them I've worn both this
actually would probably look really nice
let's see I'm gonna oh yeah I don't love
the smell of this
at all but hey but it dry oh I like that
it dries pretty quick at least wait if
you do a thin layer and I really do like
it and it really does stay on for quite
a while I wore it to school the other
day the news on for quite a few hours
that was nice
okay oh my god rest calm down just the
last thing I picked up just the other
day was this Rimmel stay matte the new
start it's probably washed out the new
liquid mousse foundation I got it in the
shade oh nine one light ivory and I
think that's the second to lightest
shade but don't put me on that this is
certainly a thicker you know they call
it a mousse foundation for a reason it's
certainly a thicker consistency there it
is but it I really like it I'm wearing
it on my face today I didn't have to set
it with any powder I asked on Instagram
actually the other day if I if you guys
wanted me to do a review and most of you
said yeah all of you said yes everyone
that respondent said yes what am I
talking about
so I might do a review video on this
soon because I really really do like it
I bought it for $5.99 or 594 at Meijer
near me
so I was really excited I thought about
buying the primer but I just bought that
maybelline baby skin primer and I was
like okay how many primary so I need I
don't even use primer every day so but I
am curious to try it
anywho so those are all the things I've
gotten and that was my tip C bag if
you're interested me up see the links
below this month really was a month I
also have links down below for all kinds
of subscription boxes I do a lot of
videos on them there's Birchbox there's
star box and I just did one I just
posted it what it was um oh my gosh oh
my gosh my gosh it's I'm Blanc boxycharm
whoa and that one was actually awesome
this month so if you're curious you can
find links to join those subscription
services below or check in my videos you
can see past videos of about those boxes
anyway I'm chit-chatting all day so um
anyway I didn't say on that many time I
said it a lot but not as many as before
I had to consciously think about that
and I still said I'm a lot that's a bad
sign isn't it and I'm an actor you think
I'd be good at that but acting you just
memorize lines and then you could say
him you're not saying
because that's not your line you know
anyway I'm gonna work on that then then
I'll be a better speaker anyway I'm
taking tons of speech classes I should
be really good at this but I'm not any
good so I'll catch you guys very soon
