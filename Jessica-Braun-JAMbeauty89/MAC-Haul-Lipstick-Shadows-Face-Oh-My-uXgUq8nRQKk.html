Mac Hall I'm I feel like I do a lot of
like Sephora hauls but it's very rare
that I do a soul Mac haul so let's go
ahead and get into it I'm peeking in and
I'm so excited I'm gonna start with okay
there's one item ivory purchased and the
restaurant new let's start the lipstick
sometimes I feel like lipsticks are the
most exciting so I bought a luster
lipstick in the shade
now when I bought it I was at Disney
World and they have a Mac store at
Disney springs which used to be down
hunt Disney the lady they were really
busy and the lady was really really nice
but she grabbed me Mac perseverance and
I remember we got out of the store and
it was late at night so I opened the mac
lipstick and I looked I'm like that
doesn't look like patisserie but it was
in the dark too so i swatched it and I'm
looking at it outside in the dark and
I'm like that doesn't that looks darker
than what I wanted so that I'm looking
and I had Tyler look and he's like it
says perseverance I'm like no so we went
back like within minutes and I she was
so nice she got me the right shade but
yes so this is patisserie it's just this
gorgeous kind of light peach shade that
has a nice lively luster to it it's not
shimmery by any means it's just it kind
of gives life to your lips so right now
I'm wearing a matte lip color but I'm
kind of I'm testing one out to be honest
but I'm kind of moving away from that
and I feel like a lot of us are because
it's not very comfortable on the lips
all the time and for every day it's kind
of nice to have something a little more
moisturizing on your lips so I love this
shade it's like exactly my lip color
exactly so it just makes my lips look
healthy I don't want to say it but it's
totally a your lips but don't look like
the next thing I bought I can't stop
using I didn't use it today I was trying
to not use it for like a hot second but
I can't stop using it this is the Mac
Paint Pot in Indian wood and it is this
ridiculously gorgeous kind of bronzy
golden shade and you know these stay on
all day if you've ever used a Paint Pot
but it's just this ridiculous beautiful
everyday shade you can ramp it
by putting other shadows with it but you
can also just wear it alone I literally
most of the time we were on vacation
once I bought this I just put it on my
lid and I grabbed a fluffy brush and
just kind of blend it out the crease and
that was it I put nothing else on
because it just looks so beautiful
so if you have a similar skin tone to
mine or if you just love these kinds of
shades on yourself I really think you'd
like it and I usually the only Mac Paint
Pots I ended up keeping after I've
decluttered a lot were like my skin tone
type colors that were really mad because
I use them as a primer but this is the
first one I've gotten that's a different
color than my own skin tone that I feel
like oh my gosh how have I not owned
this till now it is amazing and I went
swimming in it so you know and it did
not budge next thing I got kind of on a
similar vein is this matte pigment in
tan this is an absolute cult classic but
I feel like people have forgotten about
it recently um a subscriber of mine had
sent me like a little bit of this a long
time ago and it was so amazing so I'm
excited to have the full size I had
posted about this on Instagram saying
you could buy like a smaller size
because I have the smaller version of
vanilla it was only like 10 bucks it was
amazing
cuz you don't really use pigments up at
least I don't so I asked the lady
working there like do you guys have the
smaller size and she said no but in my
head I figure oh but they probably do
online but a lot of you guys on my
Instagram post about this pigment you
guys are saying no they don't do any
more so I haven't looked further yet but
this shade is stupid look at that I
can't even like look at like I just get
like insane when I look at it when i
swatched it I was like I forgot how
amazing this is it is stupid it is so
pretty so I wore this on my lids I've
actually worn it on my lids above Indian
wood and it looks gorgeous you know
probably however the best way to wear
this would be like remember when NYX
like the NYX jumbo sticks in milk were
like all the rage on YouTube if you've
watched it for a couple years well it's
still a good product I don't have any
more but if you would put like a white
like a literal white primer or shadow on
under it and then put this on top
it would just pop like crazy it would
look amazing these two are like you if
you are wanting to buy some stuff from
Mac and you're not sure where to start
both of these are so good so good the
Mac face products most of them break me
out so I've since gotten rid of any Mac
powders Mac blushes because I think I
realized that I loved full of joy but I
think I realized quickly that I it was
breaking me out so for me those aren't
working well but they're lip products
their eye products are so some more
eyeshadows I bought a couple more single
eyeshadows if you're interested in some
Mac dupes I did a whole video of mac
eyeshadow dupes with a lot I don't
remember how many but a lot of dupes so
I'll link that below because a lot of
you guys loved that video and the dupes
were like pretty cheap now I will say
this you can now get Mac shadows in the
like just the pan form or you can put it
like you can put it in a Z palette you
could not put it in anything you could
put it in a little duo or quad whatever
these are only six dollars now I asked
the lady in this store I was like how
much for in the pan and I don't member
what it was I'll say it I'll put it on
the screen right now that's how much it
is like in the actual little compact for
the shadow and then she said but the the
regular like pan refills are six dollars
so I'm just like oh that might as well
be drugstore prices kind of so that's
pretty exciting and their palettes are
really cheap as well so I'll link their
palette below as well as these shadows
because you guys I will say I love that
Mac has reduced their prices with some
of that stuff or at least I think
they've reduced it maybe I'm wrong let
me know oh you guys will umm so this
shade I got was called soba sob a and
it's kind of got a shimmer to it but
it's kind of a light tan but like a warm
tan color and I I just love it kind of
like a camel tan and it's the perfect
crease shade I'm just now getting more
into warm shadows I used to be all about
the shadows like I would only wear cool
tone things period that's all I would
buy and what I would have a warm tone
thing I'd get rid of it but now I'm
really into it so like I'm going crazy
about
this next shot I got was called
mythology it's like a pink I don't want
to call it rose gold and the pan it kind
of looks like that but this really is
like a pinkish bronze and it's just so
beautiful it does have a lot of glittery
shimmer to it but it didn't at least the
three times I've used it so far it
didn't have enough fallout that I was
like oh my gosh this is crazy I'm so
glittery I just took a powder brush and
just kind of whisked it away and I
noticed that a powder brush really does
work better than your hands cuz the heat
of your hands and the oil can actually
push it into your skin and then it's
there so if you use just a big fluffy
brush it'll whisk it away really easily
these shades are amazing I can't wait to
add them to my little Z palette that I
have the last map thing I got is
actually a repurchase this is the mac
fix+ I keep buying this size the first
time I bought it I bought this size
because I wasn't sure if I would like it
well it's almost gone I ended up
bringing it with me on my trip and I
have a whole video on that travel the
makeup I brought on my trip for two
weeks so if you're interested in seeing
that I'll link it below as well but I
grabbed my mac fix+ with me and it's
like really really low so while I was
there I was like I'm you know I might as
well just buy it so I don't have to buy
it again later um I will say so I got
some of my eyeshadow swatch run it um I
keep getting this size because since I
travel with it a lot I like to have the
smaller size in reality I probably
should just buy the big one to have at
home and then have this for travel we'll
see but while I was there I was like
well I'm flying home and we're not
checking any bags so I knew I couldn't
buy the big one umm ironically in the
end I ended up checking my bag because
it was packed with souvenirs so so that
was everything I bought from Mac would
love to know what you would recommend
that I try next from Mac since I really
have gotten out of the habit from buying
a lot from them but they do have really
good products so let me know down below
what you would recommend and other than
that I hope that you guys will catch
more of my hauls which I can link below
and I'll see you guys in my next video
