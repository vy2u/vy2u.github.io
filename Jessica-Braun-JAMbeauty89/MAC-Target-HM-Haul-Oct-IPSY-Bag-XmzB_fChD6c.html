to be back from vacation and I have a
haul for you so okay let's start with
the IPPS you bag that came for October
it always comes in this I'm gonna leave
a link down below for the if see website
if you'd like to join and what's so cool
so that you know when you join through
my link I get epsy points so if you join
and then you share your personal link
with friends family if you have your own
channel Instagram whatever and then your
friends join using your own link you get
points they call them MC points and when
you get a thousand Dipsy points you get
to pick out they have like a free
different few different things you can
pick to get for free like products you
can get for free using just those apes e
points so this is my free product I got
it is the NYX smokey look kit and if you
look on the back it's got all these
different shadows so I guess I can open
it saw like tape shut I'm thinking about
giving this to one of my sisters cuz I
just don't need anymore you know I
you've seen my makeup collection if you
haven't only get below but I've got
plenty of makeup the last thing I need
is more makeup but I'm gonna try to open
this carefully okay cuz I think I will
give it to my sister this is cute little
compact thing and then when you open it
see oh it's so cute okay when you open
it it has all these shadows here aren't
those pretty
maybe I'll keep it oh no cuz it looks
like there's some matte shadows there in
this row some matte shadows and then
these are all kind of more shimmery but
not too shimmery and then I think if I
remember correctly like when I saw it
that does this lift up or this come out
oh yeah this bottom part comes out and
there's some lip things now I know I
would never I'm gonna be honest I would
never use those anything where I have to
apply like lipstick with a brush or
something separate I'm like no it's
never gonna happen
it's not true sometimes I do but anyway
but this was free with a thousand points
so that I think when one person jus wins
you get 250 points so if you get four
people to join you can pick out a free
thing they also had cute like little
hair tie things you know the cute ones
that are elastic and thicker and they
also
like BADgal lash on there so there's a
lot of cute little things you can get
just getting your friends to join so if
you would like to join using my code go
for it cuz I'll get some free stuff and
I'll be able to give it to people I care
about but doesn't matter point is if
she's awesome
it's ten dollars a month and you always
get a makeup bag in like five it is not
like five it is five products and most
of them are usually full size that's the
thing Birchbox I feel like it's always
like trial size but if she's almost
always full size so the makeup bag it
came with is this one it says love of
beauty is taste the creation of beauty
is art I think it's an interesting quote
I don't know I don't know how I feel
about that quote actually cuz I think I
don't know I don't know anyway I haven't
thought enough about this quote okay so
one of the things that came with that
didn't fit in the bag with this Coastal
Scents brush sample this is their medium
shadow brush and I'm gonna open it here
actually because I'm curious to know
kind of how it feels now with eyeshadow
brushes they're little oh actually oh
I'm super it's very soft this would be
one that I would use to pack shadow on
my lid here like a shimmery champagne
Tek color but it's surprisingly soft so
that's pretty awesome so that was good
and then it also came with this soy and
nail polish it's in the color it's in
the color Giovanna mm-hmm so Italian
look how pretty that is
I don't think no I know I don't have any
Oh polishes color so that's really
pretty I'm trying I don't think I would
like it on my toes but I would
definitely like it on my finger nails so
and that's obviously a full size right
there
and then what else is in here this is
the style sexy hair texturising spray
clay I haven't used this yet I don't
want to spray it on my hair by the way
my hair is straight because I realized I
haven't straightened my hair in like a
million years like quite literally and
said I'm going to a Halloween party and
I'm going as Debra Morgan and if you
watch the show Dexter you will know that
that is his sister and she has you know
straight brunette hair
and I've got the clothes picked up it's
a perfect effort outfit that she would
wear and I'm really excited it was great
because I didn't have to spend any money
on it and really makeup wise I mean I'm
gonna add some more bronzer because
she's Tanner and she always kind of has
like a glowy face but aside from that
it's really other than adding some
highlight and some bronzer that it's
just a normal everyday makeup look so
because I thought about doing a tutorial
then I was like mm hey no one really
knows who she is a but you watch Dexter
and it's it's almost too easy anyway
okay and then two more products that
came with this is the Olay Henriksen or
old
it's got to be Olay I don't know it's
all know what is it called there's like
all these tiny font the truth cream
facial memo and bands hydration facial
moisturizer just this cute little jar
frankly I really need some moisture
right here now that I broke out from
this thing that I'm gonna tell you guys
about the second so that's gonna be
really nice and then a pigment this is
the mineral shimmer it's Bella Terra
mineral cosmetics and it's in the shade
Navy and it's a true like navy blue I'm
not gonna open it because frankly I
don't think I'm gonna use this I'll
probably give this to a friend cuz I
just usually don't wear Navy I'm gonna
be real so we got I mean look at all
that you get with this this is awesome
aside from the free product I got which
is really awesome I got the style sexy
hairspray clay a Coastal Scents brush
that's actually really nice and actually
feels like kind of heavy like well-made
this Olay Henriksen advanced cream the
Bella Terra I'm sorry I'm like
struggling it's been a while since I
feel the video guys oh my back the
mineral eyeshadow Wow and then the
full-size Zoya polish and the makeup bag
all of that for ten bucks and then like
I said that for thing and there's always
a theme and this the theme for this
month is the art of beauty and on the
back of the card they always have a ton
of percent off deals through their
website that you can use so that's
pretty awesome like love fresh you can
get for 30% off or Zoya buy two get one
free
yeah just tons of different things so
and actually I saw that some people this
month
this bag some it differs per person
because you take like a personality or
makeup personality quiz um some people
got like a buxom lipgloss and things
like that I'm like dang where was my
buxom lipgloss shoot anyway what I was
talking about was these the all Mae
oil-free like makeup remover pads they
break me out it took me forever to
realize what it was but when I travel I
use these but I don't use them when I'm
home every time I've been traveling I've
realized like my skin gets real dry and
I used it obviously this past time that
I traveled and goodness me I am all
broken out it's like all like terribly
dry so then I realized uh Jess stop
using this theis so I can't use them now
I have a ton of these all probably given
to one of my sisters or my friends but
that kind of stinks I've been using
these forever - I'm like just how did it
take me that long to figure it out okay
so I also went to Target before I left
and I instagrammed a picture of this
this is the Aussie 3 minute miracle
conditioner you guys this stuff is
amazing i ivory bought it like 15 times
not really 15 probably like 4 it smells
like coconut like like a buttery coconut
if that makes any sense I love the smell
of this I could you smell it actually
opened and I traveled with it cuz we did
check it back and I just love this stuff
so much it got all over it was in like a
ziplock bag with one other thing because
I knew it might and it got all of
everything but I was like yeah whatever
everything smells like coconut now it
smells awesome this stuff is amazing
your hair feels so soft like it's better
than like really expensive masks
honestly if not at least just as good
and this stuff is literally like three
dollars I love this stuff ok another
thing I bought I wanted a waterproof
mascara because we were gonna be on the
beach and I was like well and even if
I'm not I don't necessarily wear makeup
on swimming and things like that but for
going out at night and it's hot
which it was I wanted waterproof just in
case so I got the voluminous million
lashes in waterproof and honestly I was
like the packaging is just so cute I
wanted it
it's got like a flexible brush and it's
one of those where the it's kind of like
rubber
rubbery bristles you guys
this stuff was terrible for me and I say
for me it was terrible for me it it was
waterproof I mean it wasn't but when you
first put it on it takes a little bit
longer to dry than I'm used to
so it was smudging up here down here I
mean it was smudging down here I've
never had smudges down here from mascara
ever and for some how this stuff was
smudging it was weird but then once it
dried it dried and the problem was if
you didn't catch the smudges you had to
get like a makeup remover you couldn't
just wipe it off and then when you try
to take it off at night I always hear
people complain like oh that mascara was
so hard to get off I'm like yeah so what
though I mean if it's a good mascara
then okay it takes an extra step to get
it off no this stuff like the next
morning I thought I'd finally gotten it
all off the next morning I had black all
over I'm like I thought there was
nothing left on my I was so weird so I
would certainly not repurchase this I'm
still gonna try and use it as much as I
can because I just don't like to waste
money and I also don't like to share
mascara like give someone else a mascara
I use just in case cuz I don't know that
gets a little sketchy
I'm gonna guess what's my sister I don't
know I honestly don't even think anyone
else's but I read reviews before I
bought it
most of the reviews were good so I'm
like maybe there's just something wrong
with me but I don't know I didn't like
it and I'm sad because the packaging is
just so cute and gold and whatever okay
so while I was in Miami and South Beach
in Key West I did just a little bit
shopping actually not much at all and I
was very proud of myself so I did go to
H&amp;amp;M which I know I mean I have an H&amp;amp;M
here but I went to H&amp;amp;M because there was
one and I found one thing that I was
really excited to bring back to the cold
weather and it's this scarf and upon
first glance it's oh so simple but and
it is I mean really there's nothing
that's special about it
but it's really really long and it's
nice and thick and it's got this pretty
glitter to it and it's just like a
pretty cream color almost like a gray
toned cream and I just think with darker
hair it just looks really nice I know
that sounds silly but a lot of times I
think how would that look with my hair
color is that it does anyone else think
like that sometimes I do and that's just
that like I don't like to wear brown
because I'm
and it blends in with my hair I don't
like to I'm a big fat leader now anyway
but I love this scarf it was 995 at H&amp;amp;M
and I have a feeling I'm gonna be
wearing this more than any other scarf
that I own and I love my scarves but I
was really excited about this and then I
went to Mac and you notice the bag isn't
that cool because I only got two things
I was so good um okay so one of the
things that I got was this eye shadow
and Omega a lot of people use this for
their brows I tried it on my brows and I
really didn't I think it was just a
little off for me but in reality I was
hoping to use it for both brow and as an
eye shadow because while it is an eye
shadow but it's this really pretty like
light taupe colored shadow and when you
get it without the pan it is see I don't
even know if you're gonna be able to see
the swatch because it's a little darker
in here it's kind of rainy out but it's
one of those colors that is the most
perfect color to use for blending like a
darker crease shadow up it's kind of
like a buffer color you know what I mean
it's just so beautiful it's honestly
even beautiful just as a crease color
it's one of those that I don't have a
shadow quite like this so it was a
perfect addition and I didn't feel that
guilty buying it because I don't have a
color and I would use it and I already
have used it a lot I'm not wearing it
today but I'm very excited about that
and then the other thing I got was a
lipstick I got Mac's lipstick in it's a
frost lipstick in angel I heard a lot of
people talking about this now I see why
I'm wearing it today and it's just like
a really simple pinkish color I mean you
know that I want to say if there's
nothing special about it except for for
me it's the perfect shade so to me it's
very special but um I really just like
it I love the way these smell this is
only my well actually it's my third
matte lipstick I own I own creme Cup
which I really like and they're very
similar but I think this one matches my
skin tone just a little bit better but I
love them both kind of for different
looks so but they are close
is that all I think that's all so
was kind of my haul over the past few
weeks sort of I know that I have a Vox
box coming from Influenster and so
you'll be seeing a video on that soon I
have a lot of videos coming up that are
in the works that I'm excited about but
I hope this is enjoyable and I'll catch
you guys very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
