have a huge collective haul tons of
makeup tons of makeup and I also have
the ape sea bag from this month so I
figured I would start with that quickly
so this is what it comes in this is the
best subscription service I did Birchbox
for a while and even still they just
give like little tiny samples now in
half the time they're not even like in
real packaging it's just like in like
paper packaging you know what I'm saying
it just drove me crazy like why am i
spending ten dollars a month on this why
why whereas with it with if see you
always get a makeup bag and it's always
different it's always kind of themed
this the theme for this year is or this
year this month is glamour Academy so
it's kind of like you know back to
school so the bag is kind of cute like
collegiate little logos cute purple and
then inside it comes with this is
awesome this is my favorite bag so far
the comes with the michael todd pumpkin
nutrient-rich facial mask and actually
it's like as big as my hand almost you
know enemy so it's actually a big size
you can actually try it out and decide
if you like the product or not want to
repurchase it which is the whole point
i'm sure for the companies to be willing
to give the stuff you know what i mean
wouldn't they want you to buy their
products fall in love with them and buy
them but if they give you a tiny tiny
sample how can you decide oh it drives
me nuts Birchbox makes me crazy
anyway came with a nail teenie nail
polish I've kind of taken these out of
the packaging because I wanted to look
at them anyway so this isn't the color
my tie it's so so pretty and I just
tweeted yesterday and if you're not
following me on Twitter you'd better get
on it I have way more followers on
Instagram than I do on Twitter which
makes no sense you'd think Twitter would
be well maybe not cuz Instagram I guess
I'm ranting it doesn't matter long story
short I just tweeted the other day that
I haven't painted my nails in like weeks
it's crazy my nails are still nakey
they're just naked nails but they're I
think they just kind of needed some time
you know I think I needed some time but
I want to use this because I want to see
how the formula is and I really like
this color I mean I feel like the color
if this would be really nice on like
your toes in the spring and summer you
know okay it also came with this mica
beauty like loose eyeshadow it's in the
shade 17 bronze really really pretty
just bronzy color it's not open open so
I think
I might leave it shut for now and then
it came with this I'll show you the
packaging Urban Decay I came with a rep
where they caught the revolution
lipstick it's their brand new line of
lipstick it's this teeny tiny little
package it's so cute
but it's this gorgeous like rosy red
color isn't that beautiful
I don't know how often I would wear this
color I mean in reality let's be serious
but I really like it and it'd be nice to
have a it's small it wouldn't take up
much room like if you had it in a clutch
like going out you know what I mean so
that's kind of nice and then it also
came with the pixi lash booster mascara
cute little pixie packaging I love their
little line or like mint green packaging
so cute so anyway so that's what was in
that and then on to the rest of the
things that I bought so from Victoria's
Secret I bought this makeup bag how
adorable
it's their classic pink and white
stripes I just love them I've always
been in love with them and it's so
classic Natori secret but what I like
about this bag is that it's decent size
she can fit a lot in it beyond just
makeup you could probably fit like you
know hair stuff that you packing maybe
or just like you know your deodorant
it's gotta it's a pretty good size and I
like that it's like wipe away you know
what I mean and then the inside is
really cute it's this black with pink
polka dots I love this it's so cute and
there was a free gift with purchase I
bought other things from there too but
I'm not gonna show you all that stuff I
mean there's a line I don't want to
cross it but this was free with purchase
this huge like weekender bag again cute
pink and white shirts although I feel
like this will get dirty really easily
because it's just kind of like a cotton
e canvas II type feel but it's so cute
and it's huge you can fit a ton in it so
I was really excited about that and we
wipe off that swatch dangerous okay so
on Macs website I bought some things I
post on Instagram that they were I don't
know I don't think it was a sale I don't
know because my friend was saying that
might just be the new prices like crazy
cheap prices so and I haven't checked
back to see if it's still the same price
so you should check but Mac had their
large palettes this size palette for $8
and then the inserts so this is like the
fifth the 15 yeah 15 I show insert for
$2 so you can take this in and out
now if you take it out because of course
you don't have to have it with the
insert it's still magnetic so it's kind
of like a nicer Z palette and so like a
dollar just cheaper than the Z column
that makes no sense it's awesome and I
love it it's see-through so I actually
bought a backup of the refill and backup
I mean eventually I figure I'll fill it
um but actually in here I just have one
Mac shadow and then the rest are this is
max table here and the rest are elf
because L fits in there too and their
shadows are spot-on
and then I also bought a little duo one
for I think it was only like four
dollars I figure for like brow colors
then I could just have like a two
options for like brows you don't I mean
of course they don't own those yet but I
figure eventually I will and for that
cheap I was like I'm just buying it I
don't care I'll figure help all right
so from Target I bought a candle this is
the sugar blossom candle I know that a
lot of people talk about this sweet is
it called sweet spun sugar or something
like that smells good but this one
smells very similar but just a little
bit more grown-up I'm 24 years old I
don't want my room to smell like a candy
store I don't know you know what I mean
it makes me I don't know but this one
has almost like a little bit of a musk
to it but it's very sweet
even still so it's just like the grownup
version of it and this is the small
version that was five dollars they have
the larger one for ten so yes another
thing that I bought that I'm totally
totally smitten with is this item from
Marshalls or TJ Maxx one of the two I
think Marshalls $12.99 and it is a brush
holder now that spins and it has six
compartments if you can see they're like
little triangular compartments and it's
so cute it's $12.99 and it looks okay so
I have you guys can't see it and I can I
have a brand new desk slash vanity in
this storage system and I don't have a
quite organized the way I wanted to so I
will be doing an updated makeup
collection video within the year within
the rest of the year although it might
be more of a Christmastime thing we will
see but my collection I just re-watched
my original makeup collection video and
from when I started which I started what
like four months ago so not too bad but
within that time
my collection has grown like times three
it's so cool because a lot of you guys
have sent me stuff ah it's just the
sweetest you know you've seen my like
unboxing videos and I can link some down
below but I just I just love them you
guys are all so sweet to me and I really
have not received much negativity at all
and I can't thank you all enough now at
the same time negativity you take with a
grain of salt and throw it over your
shoulder because it's just like you know
what can you do with it nothing there's
nothing you can do with negativity so
you throw it out the window
but I really haven't received much so
it's it's been wonderful and you guys
are just like kind of a bright light in
my life right now so it's just nice
anyway so I went to Amish country with
my boyfriend one I mean it in Amish town
that's nearby and I never been and so I
picked up the smiths lip balm it's in
minted rose this isn't like an Amish
thing something but this brain has been
around since like the 1800s and I've
tried their original rose Sal and that's
really nice but it's a very heavy rose
scent
this one is more minty and it's it's a
sheer completely sheer color it looks
rabbeted sheer and it's just really nice
it leaves my lips really nice I've been
putting this on at night before bed and
I really liked it and it's just a nice
minty smell to smell before you in bed
and I also got these little tiny hand
creams it's by Camille Beckman and this
is mango peach number two and then this
is in French vanilla has this cute
little flower on top these are the
tiniest little hand creams but you use
the tiniest AB and it just spreads all
over your hands and it says that it's
where did it say that no it says that
it's glycerine hand therapy and it is
makes my hands softer than anything I
have ever used in my life like I can't
describe it
these are amazing they're only I could
dollar ninety-nine each so yeah okay I
picked up from Big Lots the vital care
vitamin E night repair cream and this is
a pretty big bottle or jar for a night
cream and it was like three dollars I
think it was literally like two dollars
and 80 cents and vital care is my
favorite brand of face products right
now I have their day cream that I use
every single day that I've talked about
numerous past videos and I also use
their vitamin E oil that I really like
but I found it at Big Lots they sell it
online as well
so love it it has like a berry vanilla
smell it's a really calming light scent
I really really like it I also picked up
the equate baby shampoo it was like
three dollars cheaper than Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson and I even had of course I had a
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson coupon of course I did
coupon but it was still you know this
was way cheaper and I've decided that
Walmart's brand is fine like when it
comes to buying a generic brand of baby
shampoo but I've tried the like Dollar
Tree brand and it is horrible it is not
the same formula at all not even close
not even same texture consistency
nothing about it is really the same and
I it's just a nightmare trying to clean
my brushes with that I used it all up
but I hated it I needed every second of
it so I'm glad it's almost gone and
excited to move on to this cuz this
actually is just like Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson
okay so I also got the soft soap body
butter and heavenly vanilla this smells
heavenly
it really does oh my gosh I want to
smell again this might be one of my
favorite it's like vanilla bean ice
cream if you let it melt this is about
to get real specific it's like vanilla
bean ice cream if you let it melt and
then like maybe warm it up a little bit
I mean I would never do this cuz that
would be disgusting but if he like
warmed it up and it was like warm
vanilla milk and maybe sprinkled a
little cinnamon on it - it smells so
good
and it's like three to four dollars
depending on where you get it I also
picked up a new hairspray I'm excited by
at a $2.00 off coupon it's got to be too
sexy voluptuous volume hairspray I
haven't tried it yet so I don't know if
I like it but I needed a stronger hold
hairspray because I always have like a
touchable hold hairspray and then a
stronger one and I actually have they
got to be like what do they call I don't
know but it's the one that's more
touchable it's like with cashmere and
it's real cute and like yellowish
purplish so I'm excited to give this one
a try and I only ended up hanging like
two dollars for and after the coupon so
we will see how I like it
and then I also picked up the aimer it's
the long-wear and waterproof gentle eye
makeup remover so it's the one that does
have the oil and you have to shake it up
you know but they also have one for like
that's more gentle that's oil-free so
you don't want well you know so they had
a lot of options and also I had a $2
coupon so win-win and then I picked up
the Loreal ever sleek this is their
precious oil treatment with argan oil
from Morocco I like that it has a pump
it was like 10 right oven like 12
dollars but it has a little pump which I
like and it comes with a little bit more
than the organics one that I'm using
right now I've got to finish that up I'm
almost done with it before I'll try this
but cuz I'm just trying to be better
about not opening products until I'm
like done with the one before it you
know what I mean
I get so darn impatient and then I open
it and I have like two Moroccan oils
open I'm like why why did I do this so
I'm gonna wait but I'm really excited
this one had oh that's what I wanted to
read it said it has argan oil and then
sunflower and olive oil so I thought
those were interesting ingredients I'm
excited to see how it is okay so onto
some more makeup yay I picked up the
blistex restore and revive little duo
these little jars and the one let's see
whoop
of course I dropped it revive has SPF of
15 and shea butter and fruit extracts
and then this one is restore and it has
phytonutrients whatever that is in
vitamin E and no SPF so I have a feeling
this the restore one by blistex would be
nice like in the evening because SPF
drives my lips out I don't know my ears
but it dries mine out so like this would
be nice overnight and then maybe the SPF
one during the day so just kind of have
a little duo working hand in hand and
they snap together how adorable is that
so and that was like adopt I just
dropped it again seriously it was like a
dollar fifty for the set so it's like
pretty awesome deal for two different
little pots of things I also got the LA
Colors what exactly do they call it just
oh la colors auto eyeliner it's just a
retractable black eyeliner I got it at
the Dollar Tree although I'm pretty sure
it's only a dollar anywhere la color is
sold but it's not the blackest line in
the world however for a dollar if you're
just tight lining with it and then
you're gonna put like another liner on
top of it this is perfect because it
gets it darkens that area enough and
then if you're gonna put like cream or
gel eyeliner on top of it it doesn't
really matter how black this one is so I
really liked it it doesn't really smudge
too much and it's a dollar so anyway
okay so I also picked up these
cotton swabs in a little Mickey and
Minnie container you guys know I love
Disney so much and it was only a dollar
so I was like yeah I'm gonna need to buy
that for sure
soon I also got this Physicians Formula
healthy wear bronze are really cute
little packaging I got it in the shade
light and you know it's got a little
mirror and of course it comes with a
little brush I can kind of swatch it for
you
it certainly it looks like it's kind of
got an orange tint to it which kind of
makes me sad but I don't know if you
guys can see that there probably not but
it is light which is nice so like if I'm
you know I'm pretty fair-skinned most of
the year even in the summer I'm decently
fair so might be a nicer option than
some of the darker ones that I have so
and actually I found this at Big Lots
for only like 3 or 4 bucks so not too
bad and they did have like medium and I
think they had the deep one or whatever
as well okay also I went to tarts
website and ordered blushes oh and then
some sort of so there was like a 40% off
thing that I'd posted on Instagram and I
mean that's like an insane meal and
their blushes are pretty expensive
however they're pretty amazing and they
last all day they really really do I
just I'm in love and I'm doing so cute
so first when I picked up was Tarte
exposed so I knew I wanted that one it's
like a nude color by the way these are
their Amazonian clay 12-hour blushes by
Tarte I don't know if I said that but
this is one that you know everyone talks
about it like I want to try it and then
I did and I was like oh I get it
because it is the most perfect I'm gonna
swatch all these and do like a
side-by-side comparison type thing it is
the most beautiful like nude kind of
pinkish nude color you'd like you could
use this even to like contour into the
blush you know what I mean like kind of
used it just it's kind of an all-in-one
product I guess what I'm saying is so
beautiful and for like everyday this is
the one man I like it is so perfect and
then I picked up Tarte blushing bride
and this one is a much deeper like berry
color and I was like I don't know but I
loved the name of it so I was like I'm
gonna need to give that one a try
that's right next to it if you can see
that so it has a little bit of shimmer
to this one where as exposed has no
shimmer at all and then this one is
charisma and this one is more of like a
deeper coral color yes okay so we have
got exposed right there no shimmer at
ultimatte this one is blushing bride
this deeper berry with a little bit of
shimmer and then this one's charisma
kind of a deeper coral with a little bit
of shimmer as well these are gorgeous
they they look so nice on your cheeks it
really does last all day so like if
you're like I just want to buy one blush
that's high-end that's gonna like be
awesome I would say make sure it's a
Tarte one because these are amazing and
I mean really it just depends on your
preference of what color you like on
your face
I think charisma would look good on
everyone and I really like exposed I
think this would be tricky and it's
tricky on me because I am so
fair-skinned but I also think the berry
almost kind of looks nice on
fair-skinned although berry would look
really nice on dirt mmm they're all so
pretty I mean really you can't go wrong
with any of those colors and then it
also came with this Tarte it was like a
free sample
you got to pick which one you wanted and
this is the Tarte mineral powder bronzer
in hotel heiress and this is a much
deeper bronzer that I'm used to I'll
kind of put it next to those there it is
right there but it's a beautiful color
and again really really pigmented I have
their Park Avenue princess bronzer
that's a little bit better of a shade
for me my skin tone but I'll probably
find a way to use especially like in the
summer time it was free that's a pretty
like fly sample you know what I'm saying
so I think oh my goodness that I do and
I think that is all so yeah I hope you
enjoyed this I hope it was helpful
I don't know if it's helpful it's
probably bad because I'm like making you
want to shop more I know that's how I
feel when I watch other people's hauls
but you know anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will see you guys very
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
