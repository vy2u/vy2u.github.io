gonna share with you my 2015 favorite
makeup I call this the jammy Awards
because of my screen name Jam beauty 89
even though my initials are now jab and
not Jam but I'm gonna keep it anyway cuz
makes me think of the Grammys and I
thought that was funny so if you're just
didn't seeing any of my old jammy award
videos from 2013 and 2014 I will link
them below and up there on that little
eye you see otherwise let's go ahead and
get into it so last year I did these in
a series of videos where it was like you
know I did a face video ellipse video
etc but this year I'm just doing all in
one because I wanted to really harness
what products I was really really loving
and not just forcing myself to pick one
in every category so these are my true
blue like absolute favorites so let's
start with lips the first thing and
actually I'm wearing it on my lips right
now that I cannot stop wearing and I
don't know why is this Rimmel stay
glossy lip gloss and it's in the shade
blushing Belle graves what I love about
this the formula is just a lip gloss
there's nothing really to write home
about the lip gloss formula but this
shade is what I love so I got the old
swatches on here I cannot get off it's
just like this kind of pink but it's
like a gray toned pink and that's how
I've described it in the past and some
of you guys are like yeah I get that
yeah so I don't know how else to
describe it but I love it it's
comfortable the shade looks amazing on
its own but it also is really good at
toning down like lip colors that are
maybe too bright or too dark whatever it
is just an amazing lip gloss
the next lip product I'm gonna mention
actually I had already swatched and I
couldn't get off because that's how long
it stays on this is the Milani amore
matte lip cream and it's in the shade
lust and it's just like a really I'll
just put it on the same spot I might as
well beautiful pink shade it dries down
to a completely matte finish and it
stays put now the only thing is
after a few hours it does start to kind
of break apart which I found with most
matte lip colors but I love this color I
love I just love it I love the way it
smells
I love the applicator I love the
packaging and I can't stop using it out
of all the matte lip colors I have this
is the one I've used the absolute most
this year I love it I've been into
drugstore I'm gonna balance it out with
a high-end product because I love these
lipsticks so much these are the Marc
Jacobs Lamarck lip creams and I have two
shades the one I originally fell in love
with over the summer in France was the
shade Oh Miley which is just this
classic perfect red perfect red it's
creamy it stays in place with I mean it
stays in place but it doesn't dry your
lips out it's like it's the perfect
lipstick it's one that I've been looking
for forever I feel like so I bought it
recently bought another shade so this
one's technically not a 2015 favorite
because it's really new to me but it's
the same formula and it really is so
this is the shade infamous in that same
line and I love it it's just such a
pretty mic please interrupt my filming
just a little bit more buddy just a
little bit more I just really really
like it and this formula is incredible
so the next thing I'm gonna mention has
been a favorite all year long you can
buy this at Walmart it's under $10 this
is the hard candy bronzer highlighter in
tiki and it's just as gorgeous golden
kind of beige highlighter but what I
love about it is it's not glittery but
it's not flat it's right in between it's
kind of satiny and shimmery definitely
shimmery but it's I don't know like
there's something about it that it just
makes you look healthy and glowing but
it doesn't necessarily look like wearing
highlighter I mean you can kind of tell
but I can't stop using it I've traveled
with it a ton I can't stop talking about
it for a reason I guess I should say
because I love it and out of all my
high-end highlighters that I also have I
still reach for the hard candy one this
is my reality okay so the next product
I'm going to mention is what I've been
wearing on my face
for quite a while I don't mention it
often cuz it's really expensive and I
mostly talk about talk about drug store
but I can't stop wearing it this is the
dr. jart beauty balm and it's got an SPF
of 45 it's got a pump it's like actually
a hardback little container here I love
it and it because it's kind of like
great toned and it's not crazy oily like
I feel like every other beauty balm I've
ever tried my skin looks like an oil
slick and I don't even have a skin and
I'm like I like that dewy kind of glowy
look but there's kind of a line and it's
always way over the line so this one
it's perfectly in between and then I can
set it with like a powder foundation to
add a little more coverage it's got some
coverage but not much because I mean it
is a beauty balm it's not meant to
necessarily cover like a foundation
otherwise it would just be a foundation
I love this stuff and I just noticed
that because I wear foundations so often
you know on my day to day like Monday
through Friday teaching job I don't
necessarily need to wear foundation
every day and so that's kind of what I
realized that I need to take care of my
skin even during the day when I'm
wearing makeup so I have leaned towards
this pretty much every day and then when
I'm filming I'll either I've actually
worn this filming - but I'll usually
wear like a foundation something with a
little higher coverage I love that stuff
with that I really like this Maybelline
better skin concealer and when I bought
this I thought I would not like it at
all but I don't know why there was
something about it I was like mmm I
doubt that'll be really nice but it
actually is really nice it's just a doe
foot applicator you know nothing to
write home about the packaging or
anything but there's something about it
it's almost like a gel concealer and
when I put it on and I you can just kind
of Pat it in with your fingers you could
use a brush a Beauty Blender or whatever
it gives just enough coverage but it
feels comfortable it feels good on my
skin it doesn't settle into fine lines
it doesn't make my under eye dry I just
love it the other concealer I do want to
mention though for what I do want
really high coverage like today I'm
wearing it right here is the mac
prolongwear concealer this is a true
blue I've loved this for a couple years
now it's worth the money if you could
save up and buy it even if you just put
away a couple dollars each week until
you can buy it it's worth it it will
last you quite a while I've had this one
for longer than I would care to say but
it's working wonderfully I wear the
shade NC 15 and it's just it really
brightens that area it provides a lot of
coverage without looking super tanky the
next product I have loved this year is
the elf contour palette and not only is
this just a really good deal for the
price but this is actually something I
genuinely just love which is why I
picked this it's got this perfect
contour shade it's kind of a grey brown
which is exactly what you want for like
a shadow on your skin but it also has
this kind of bronzer e color you could
use to bronze up your face it has this
white highlight but then it also has
this yellow matte powder that I love to
use to set my concealer you could also
use it to kind of brighten your nose up
in any areas that you would typically
brighten it works wonderfully on that as
well unless you're crate I like I'm
pretty fair but if you're really really
fair it might not show up as well but I
love this palette it's such a good deal
but it's also a really really good
product it's pigmented it blends well
and it stays all day that's like the
trifecta right so I love this elf also
came out with an illuminating palette I
just got it
I wish I could include it but I haven't
had it long enough but I love it and I
cannot wait I'm doing a video on it very
very soon it is amazing the next thing
I'm going to mention is a pricey one but
I I can't not mention it this is the it
cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination it's basically a powder
foundation but it has this illuminating
quality to it but this product is
amazing because you can't detect any
shimmer or anything like that but it
just makes your skin look healthy and
glowy and I I love it and when I run out
of this I will be buying it again I'm on
the hunt to find a drugstore version of
this so if you know of any that are
similar to this let me know alright the
next thing I'm kind of wearing to
this is the Milani shadow eyes in the
shade almond cream and it's just a
really nude color I mean you could
barely see it there but it's super
pigmented what I you do is I'll just use
it as an eye primer and it like conceals
that area which is amazing but it also
holds on the shadow really well and I'll
use it on my lower lash line or I mean
on my lower waterline and it will make
my eyes look brighter and bigger but it
stays all day like watery eyes dry it
does not move it just stays I could not
believe that I brought it with me to
London and used it every single day
there and it by the end of the day it
was still theirs awesome the next thing
I mentioned is from Stila and it's their
stay all day waterproof liquid liner it
is it's just a typical felt tip liner
but it is amazing I use it every single
day to do kind of a small wing like I
did today it doesn't move just straight
up doesn't move but then it glides off
so easily when you want to wipe it off
like with makeup remover it comes right
off but it stays put during the day it
is the ideal liquid eyeliner you could
have so much control with it
I loved it I loved it for a while now I
probably purchased like five of these
this mascara is by Lancome it's their
Hypnose drama and I had this a long time
ago like a couple years ago and I loved
it and so I was so excited to try it
again this is the only mascara
that's not waterproof that holds my curl
flawlessly all day like many mascaras
will hold it pretty well but this one
lasts all day and like I've noticed a
significant difference even just
watching old videos of mine and seeing
how you couldn't even see my eyelashes
but then like nowadays I'm like you can
actually at least see them you know what
I'm saying like it's not fake eyelashes
obvious but you can still see them and I
love that I love his mascara so much the
last things I'm going to mention are two
different shadow palettes that I love
this year one stroke storm ones high-end
so the high-end one that I've loved this
year is from Too Faced it's the
chocolate bar palette this thing has
talked to death for a reason it took me
a while to finally give in to the hype
and buy it and I was still kind of
skeptical as we all can be you know it's
amazing I use it
for my luck I used this candied violet
color on my lid and then I covered it in
marzipan my favorite shade and then I
used this like milk chocolate they've
got plenty of mats in place ever this
milk chocolate mat in the semi-sweet
matte color in my crease and then I used
this matte white chocolate under my brow
bone
it is amazing all of these they're so
buttery they smell like chocolate and in
a recent video I said they taste like
chocolate and a lot of you guys were
like what time to tell I'm just gonna
say when you take the actual like if you
were to like wipe like swatch it and
then like if you lick your finger which
I do from time to time even though I
shouldn't it tastes like chocolate I
don't know if they meant for it to be
that way or if that's just the scent in
it but it definitely tastes like
chocolate you're welcome to try it but
not too much and probably be sick I
don't know so the last pot I'm gonna
mention is this L'Oreal love palette
nude one there's been some you know it's
kind of been wishy washy on YouTube some
people love this some people don't it's
not the most pigmented creamy shadow
palette you'll ever try it's not like
like the Too Faced shadows but there's
something about these they blend for me
they blended very well together and they
create looks that I just really really
like um I I don't know how else to
describe it because I there's no other
reason why I love it so much but I just
love the looks that I always get with
these I did a video where I created a
look with that I will link below where i
swatched this and the number two palette
which is like kind of more purpley rosy
tones I love it's kind of pricey for a
drugstore patho in my opinions to
definitely wait for like sales coupons
maybe both
so those are all of my favorites for
this year I hope that you'll join our
little family here and subscribe if you
haven't already otherwise check out some
of my other videos linked down below and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
