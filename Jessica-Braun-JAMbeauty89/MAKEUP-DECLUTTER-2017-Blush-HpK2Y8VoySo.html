currently have I do have some light
trios and other things I'm going to get
to in a minute I'll do all of those
together as if they're their own
separate category but I've got all my
powder blushes cream blushes stick
blushes all of it now I declare all the
time pretty much twice a year and one
thing to keep in mind if you're new to
my channel or you've never watched my
declutter zhh is that you know obviously
YouTube is a job of mine and I get a lot
of this from companies so I get rid of a
lot of stuff because it's either just
absolutely not right for me but I didn't
necessarily spend my own money on it and
the reason I mentioned that is because
I've had a lot of people watch my videos
and they're like why are you so dumb
about like what you're buying why are
you buying colors that are terrible for
you if you're just going to declutter
them like no usually I didn't buy them
if it's a color that looks crazy on me
and you'll see a couple examples today
and you'll see what I mean but anyway I
am going to be ruthless I just asked you
guys on snapchat just yesterday actually
for some youtubers that I should watch
that are really really ruthless in their
declutter and they really get rid of a
lot because I watched some and they'll
have like 100 foundations and they get
rid of like 5 and I'm like yeah well
that's not really a great declutter but
obviously we're all declutter inform
reasons there's no right or wrong way to
do it but I know what I like to watch
and so hopefully you're into some severe
declutter as well which is why you're
probably watching this so without
further ado let's get into it um what
I'm going to do one of my favorite ways
to declutter is to look at my little
collection here and ask myself what
would I buy again I'm going to pretend
like this is a store and I'm shopping
what would I go and totally buy again
because I love it I travel with it I
reach for it all the time and so with
that in mind one of the first things I
think of right away is this elf blush
and mellow mauve it's like my one of my
favorite blush is one of the prettiest
colors ever it's just so natural you can
almost not even see it on my hand there
but it's so so pretty
definitely keeping that another one that
I would buy again would be this
hourglass one I love it's in the shade
mood exposure and it's very similar
color to that but these are my favorite
colors for a reason
this one's a little bit almost lighter
because you can really see it there but
it's a little bit more of a blue
tone and I just really really like it so
that's one that's coming with me coming
with me where am I going another one
very similar shade this benefit Dallas
it's my favorite benefit box powder I
think I've owned all of the box powders
at this point and this is the only one
I've kept over the years it is almost
bronzer II but I use it more as like a
blush another one I would buy again it's
a really frosty one it's pixi by petra
and it's their beauty blush duo and
peach honey I just did a Target brands
best and worse because there's like
pixie and Sonia Kashuk and all those
brands you always see there and you
don't necessarily hear a lot about I did
a huge review on a bunch of stuff and
this is one of my favorites it's just a
really frosty pretty peach color and I
just it's one of those that I use all
the time when I want that peach look so
I'm definitely keeping this other one
that's one of my favorites is the city
color one in black berry it's very very
pigmented very very pretty like kind of
blue toned pink I love it so that's a
key I have two of these soap &amp;amp; Glory
ones here the peach party and wonder
bronze they're both really really pretty
I think I'm gonna hold on to these this
is very similar to that one it's just a
little bit bronze e'er if you will but I
think it's so pretty so I'm going to
keep that one and then this wonder
bronze one is honestly really similar
maybe I'll get rid of this one I mean
there this one's a little bit bronze
e'er than that one I don't think I need
to keep both but which one do I really
want to keep I'm kind of thinking I'm
kind of thinking the peach one I think I
might like the peach one a little bit
better so I think I'm gonna get rid of
the wonder bronze and peach pie and at
the end I'll show you what I'm keeping
what I'm not so you can kind of get an
idea this one I'm going to keep I just
recently got from Too Faced and I just
I've only tried it like three or four
times it's a really pretty shimmery
color again very peachy but I just
really like it so I'm gonna keep that
one
this one this one from NARS called sin
is what I don't have anything like this
I just wore yesterday actually it's
really almost like bruised plum kind of
a color it's so pretty it actually looks
really flattering even on fair skin
tones like mine so it kind of blew me
away but I'm definitely keeping that so
now what I'm kind of left with here are
products I'm not sure about so I'm going
to kind of consolidate here and then
we'll go through these one by one too
decide if I want to keep them or not I
think this wet and wild one I liked it
it's called the princess daiquiris and
over the summer I think I wore it a ton
it's a really pretty blush but I feel
like I'm not ever reaching for it so I
think it's just time to get rid of this
one it's just sitting in my collection
this quote this quote one I really like
but I don't like to use it too often
because I feel like you guys can't
access it you guys can't get it here in
the States but it's so pretty I think
I'm going to keep it but it just thinks
because I can't show it a ton on my
channel this Milani one I've also liked
but it's not crazy pigmented it's been
one of my favorites it is a really
pretty color but see it doesn't really
show up and even with the brush I what
I've liked about it is that it's a
really natural look and you can't really
screw it up but again I feel like a lot
of people can't access Milani as much as
I wish you could and it's just not I
don't know again I'm not really reaching
for it and that's the whole point of
this this Catrice one is just way too
dark for me they sent this to me a while
ago it's actually a really nice blush
but it's just too too too too too much
it's almost fluorescent pink so cute
blush really nice quality getting rid of
it this makeup geek one I love the pan
it's so nice it's an amazing blush but
again I'm never using it is way way too
pigmented for me so I'm going to pass
that on this Sigma one same thing it's
so bright it's I mean this is a little
more wearable I think than the other
ones for me but again it's such a bright
pink that I'm never ever reaching for it
and I love the packaging but I'm gonna
get rid of that this one here is by dusa
and it's just I'm never going to use it
I got it in like a subscription box it's
just this little baby one I mean I'm
just not going to use it I know myself
it's a pretty color
but I'm just going to pass on this NARS
one and deepthroat is one of my
favorites I travel with this one a lot I
actually can't believe I overlooked this
as I was shopping my stash just a really
pretty natural color definitely gonna
keep that this one I've used but it
reminds me of the this one here and I
don't really need both I know I've got a
couple that look the same but this is
one it's getting kind of this weird
thing on it and it kicks up so much
powder it's kind of crazy it's really
pretty it's kind of got this like
duochrome look to it but it's a little
bit too much so I think I'm going to
pass it on these three pixi by petra x'
they're not bad i again this is when i
mentioned in that target video the one I
actually really liked I think was this
one baby petal it's just the most
natural color out of all of them but I
know I'll tell you right now I'm going
to get rid of these this one's a baby
pink one in watermelon veil again it's
just a little bit my little bit I mean a
lot of it way too light for me this one
is not bad it's called wild rose but
again it's just a little maybe too deep
for me this one I want to keep because I
like the color but I feel like I never
wear it but I also feel like I really
haven't gotten a ton of use out of it so
I want to keep this one to keep trying
this Mac by mariah carey one they just
sent to me pretty recently it's called
sweet sweet fantasy blushes are just
kind of hit or miss for me I don't love
this I think I'm just gonna I've only
worn it like once or twice maybe I
should give it more of a shot but I'm
gonna tell you right now I probably
won't hold on to this by the next to
clutter it might already be gone I'm
gonna give it a try if I don't love it
I'm gonna get rid of it but I don't want
to I've only used it like twice I don't
want to get rid of it without really
giving it a go but I'm really I don't
know I feel like Mac products can be so
hit or miss like some of them are so
good but like sometimes I feel like they
get a bigger hype than what they truly
deserve I don't know
Too Faced this is the pink leopard one I
used to have all of theirs this is the
only one well not the only one I've got
some of their bronzers but this one
depending on how you use the brush it
can be kind of pretty but it kind of
just got this gray tone that doesn't
always look nice on me so I think I'm
going to pass it on I'm getting rid of a
lot this is great this Estee Lauder one
I just don't ever use that there's
something about this pan that's like
kind of small and because of that I feel
like I never want to use it because I
can't get the brush to be totally coated
in the blush so I'm going to pass this
on I have a sister that I think will
really like that this NYX one I continue
to try their NYX blushes and while they
might swatch nice I just never impressed
with how they stay on it's a pretty
color but I'm just going
pass it on this Bobby Brown one I
actually just recently got it's a really
pretty kind of like black berry type
color it's called sand pink and it is
very pigmented so this is one that I
always have to use light hand but it's
the only Bobby Brown blush I've ever
tried it's kind of dirty so I think I
want to again give this more of a try to
determine how I like their formula and I
like the shade but again I have to use
such a light hand so I'm gonna keep
trying that one out this NYX cream blush
is actually the only cream blush I have
and it's the only cream brush I
genuinely really really like they always
look a little bit wet on the skin but
kind of in a flattering way I kind of
like the way it ends up looking so I am
going to continue to keep this to see
your blush i it's like the only well a
lot of these are expensive blushes but
this is like the most expensive blush I
own I really really like it it's called
my rows number 943 I do use this a good
amount so I'm definitely going to keep
this and I have the little sleeve board
over here this elf shimmering facial
whip I like I've talked about a lot but
I don't reach for it a lot so I'm going
to pass it on but it is this is what
kills me like it blew my mind when i
swatched it in a video and I've worn it
it is so beautiful but the thing is when
I have so much I just never end up
wearing it it is so so pretty but you
know as I blend it out more and more on
my cheeks it just doesn't flatter my
skin tone as much as I'd like it to
either so pretty though and this last
one is a bite multi stick in macaroon
I'm just never reaching for these I
would scent these a while ago and I just
don't ever reach for him they're a
little bit too difficult to work with I
think and I don't think these are bad
but I just don't really find any use for
them at all maybe on my lips but again
I've got like a million other lipsticks
that I'd rather wear
you
so this is everything that I'm keeping
over here and that is everything I'm
getting rid of so I'm getting rid of 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
different blushes and I'm keeping 3 6 9
12 Wow
I'm keeping 15 so I got rid of exactly
half I think that is awesome as I kind
of glanced through this there's nothing
I don't think that kind of sticks out as
like why am i keeping that the only ones
I'm thinking is this Mariah Carey one
but again I need to try it a little bit
more but everything else is these are
products that I reach for all the time
that I really really like so I'm excited
to have these in my collection it just
feels really good to get rid of all that
other stuff and I know that I've got
sisters and nieces and friends and
co-workers that would be very excited to
try these bad boys out if you are
waiting for my other declares to go live
and you're wanting more I've been doing
Duke letters for years and I'm usually
just about this cutthroat so sometimes
even more so if you're interested in
watching some more you're just in that
mood I will link my declares playlist
below so you can check it out there's
tons and tons and tons and tons of them

declutter is coming up and I'll see you
