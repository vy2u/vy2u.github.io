think I've got them all again I've got
some like two or three and one kind of
kids that have highlighters but I'm
going to do them separately if you
haven't seen my blush to clutter with
about just as many blushes actually I
might have more highlighters the blushes
I don't know I will link that below I
got rid of half of my collection it was
awesome so hoping to do the same here
although for some reason highlighters
are so difficult for me because I really
I love them and they all do different
things that I know to someone that
doesn't use highlighter all the time
that might sound ridiculous to you but
if you do love highlighters like me you
totally get what I'm saying so one of my
favorite ways to do this as I mentioned
in that is to just look at my entire
collection and pull out as if I'm
shopping the things that I know I would
totally buy again so I'm going to
pretend shout my collection the things
that I would buy again would be this is
so difficult this okay this is this RMS
beauty living Luminizer and it's like
really popular I know like a lot of
celebrities and somebody makeup artists
are using it because it's this kind of
very unique highlight where it's more
just like glossy then like shimmery and
it's like you know this kind of cream it
just makes you look like you're really
alive really dewy without looking
shimmery shiny well I guess it is a
little shiny but not shimmery or
glittery and I love this there's another
shade that I want to try as well but
I've really been liking this and see
this is why I'm excited to declutter
because I feel like right now I have so
many highlighters I'm never using this
because I'm picking between like 40
million our lighters but if I have way
less than I'm more likely to actually
get use out of the products I have so at
the end of the video I'll show you what
I'm keeping what I'm getting rid of by
the way next what else would I buy oh
this Laura Mercier highlighter it's
their matte radiance baked powder and
highlight 0-1 this is one that gets a
lot of publicity here on YouTube just
because it really is so good but it's
just this kind of beautiful like almond
colored highlight it's so matte radiance
is a great word for it because it's
radiant but it doesn't look shimmery but
it does but it doesn't but it does what
it doesn't that's what's so cool about
it so definitely keeping that I just
wish the packaging weren't as bulky as
it is another
that I'm loving are these oh my gosh all
three of these these al Jeunesse reveal
concentrated luminizing drops you can
use any of these three colors if you've
got a skin tone like mine any of them
look beautiful but there's this more
golden one the more pinkish one and the
more beige and so the gold is called
champagne rose a for the pink and pearl
these are perfect names for these anyway
it's just a little medicine dropper type
thing and I'll just put a little bit
like on my hand and then with the
stippling brush or something I'll just
stipple it into that and then put it on
my cheekbones and on my like temple area
it just looks so natural so beautiful
and I just love it and it's a little bit
thinner of a consistency than like the
Becca one which I also like which I'm
realizing is not out here I need to go
grab because I do own it I just love
these I love it they're smaller they're
easier to travel with I was just in
Chicago for a week I traveled with this
loved them so much I'm keeping all three
okay I've added the Becca one to the mix
um alright so continuing on what else
would I buy again oh my gosh this one in
dim light this hourglass one and dim
light is like one of those it's almost
not really a highlighter I mean really
these are technically not highlighters
these they're like finishing powders but
some of them like on the natural day I
put only where I would put highlight but
this one is just such a natural beige
color and it makes your skin look all
over glowy
but not shimmery at all it's so
beautiful this is also in my little trio
here but I wanted the singular size
because I love it and I travel with it
all the time and again I kind of
forgotten about so I'm so excited to
have this in my collection have it be
more visible in my collection so a
drugstore one that I love is this
Physicians Formula one in natural nude a
lot of people have talked about this for
years and I just never ever tried it but
it's such a gorgeous very very shimmery
one you know you can get it to be a
little lighter if you just focus up
there you can get it a little deeper if
you focus down there it's just an
amazing amazing almost like house you
can almost get bronzer he shades
depending on your skin tone it is so
good they it does have a little brush
over here I don't ever use but if you
were in a pinch you totally could and
you could totally I never even realized
that was
there you could totally use this little
thing to do other I mean there's just a
lot you can do with it I love it
another drugstore one that I've had for
years but I think I've had this for so
long it might be time for me to
repurchase I don't know but it feels
okay but it's this hard candy one it's a
very yellow toned glow but it's so
beautiful
I know some people love this some people
hate it I happen to love it but it's
called Tiki and it's just so beautiful I
just love it
I think I'm going to keep it for now I
think eventually I might want to
repurchase but it doesn't it doesn't
smell weird or anything even though I've
had it for a couple years and it says 24
months it's probably been over 24 months
but I think it's fine
so we'll see I'll keep a close eye on
that one but I am going to keep it
alright so let's just start going one by
one now because a lot of these I still
love and I'll probably keep but those
are the ones that like I would go out to
the store tomorrow and repurchase if it
went missing so down here these are two
elf brand new products they just sent to
me they actually sent me three but one
of them was shattered so I only have two
of the shades but this one it's their HD
highlighting powder and this one's in
starlight glow I haven't even used these
yet I've just watched them they this
ones are really pretty like yellow toned
one reminds me that hard can you want
actually so so pretty and then this one
is in sunset glow wait yeah so that was
starlight glow this one sunset glow
looks like a little bit more a little
bit deeper like a little bit more golden
or maybe even like bronzy but they're
both really really similar really really
pretty you know what I think I am going
to get rid of the hard candy one just
because these are so similar to that and
I don't need both and this one's getting
old so I'm gonna keep the two out get
rid of bar candy good whew alright one
that so this shattered I need to just
repress it I know but I'm so sad I just
maybe I'll repress it after this video
I'm going to keep it in a maybe if it's
wonky after I repress it that I'm just
going to pass it on this one I actually
and this is so rare I actually
decluttered this once before and I
pulled it out of my declutter after
filmed it and it that has only happened
like in all of the years I've been
declaring that's only happened like two
or three times um but I just kind of
realized I was like you know what I
really do love this it's such a pretty
highlight it's kind of in its own way
semi unique and it's so like BAM in your
face I just loved it and I missed it so
I pulled it out and I am glad that I did
because I do so love it this isn't soft
and gentle it's the mac mineralize
skinfinish and I feel like I've owned a
lot of Mac products over the years but
I've gotten rid of so many cuz I don't
know I like I said in the last video I
feel like it gets overhyped for like
every product they come out with but not
every product they come out with is
great so but that is one that really is
great it gets a lot of height for a
reason all right so I've got a couple of
these like them drugstore type bronzers
I like this a lot this is from Jake at
beauty it's the you glow girl but I
think it's a little bit too much for my
skin tone I've worn it a couple times
isn't that crazy it is so cool but I've
worn it a couple times and people have
remarked on my highlight being kind of
like out of control and I'm like okay
maybe it's too much for my skin tone so
I'm going to pass it on but I liked the
highlighter this next one is a lot it's
very reminiscent of my hourglass dim
light it's the revolution vivid baked
highlighter in radiant lights because
this one I think is a little bit more
shimmery than the dim light but but well
I guess they are kind of different
seeing them side by side this one does
have a little bit more shimmer to it but
it's so pretty so I'm going to keep that
I just wish that that didn't all wear
off and again I know that's so shallow
of me but I just wish it didn't all wear
off and I'm gonna keep it I mean kind of
squish squish squash these together okay
so this elf illuminating palette I
really do like and every time I use it
I'm like oh yeah it's just it's a bunch
of different tones that you can play
with I just did an elf best and worst
video a little while ago look at those
they do kick up powder but they're
really pretty they're really a lot of
them are really just natural which I
like obviously and I just did a video on
the best and worst of elf I love that
these pop out you can kind of mix and
match your own palette and I really like
their contour kit as well but I'll link
that video below because it's like a
thirty minute video
go of just tons of ELQ products some of
them are really good some of them are
really really not great so if you're
interested in that I will link it this
is a total dud I'm going to get rid of
this is this elf baked highlighter and
blush gems it's just a lot of you guys
have said you got to scrape off the top
but I'm like you know what I have so
many highlighters and elf makes decent
highlighters it's not terrible but it's
certainly not my favorite it was one of
the ones in the video that was kind of a
dud I'm just going to pass it on it's
not even worth with all this to work
with I'm not even going to put forth the
effort and I know that might sound
terrible to some but it is what it is
alright so I've got these elf pearls
umm-hmm it's alright these are okay it's
a very natural glow you get with it
supposed to be like the girl on
meteorites type things which I've also
owned in the past and de cluttered
because it really just didn't do much
for my face and I feel the same with
these it's cool that they do it and I
don't think they're bad by any means but
it's just not something I use all the
time so I'm sad to say I think I'm going
to pass it on
I think this wet and wild one I'm going
to pass on as well I love it the reserve
your Cabana I used it for a long time
again very much like dim light a really
nice kind of beige color but I just feel
like it goes bad within a year and I
know it's well actually it's got a while
it says expires in 2018 but it's one of
those that I like having for video
references but I feel like I never ever
use but I also feel like I shouldn't
declutter it if I want a reference into
videos so I'm going to think about that
one um this Cooper one I liked but I'm
just I don't reach for it's a lose of
Toulouse highlight it's a pretty one but
again it's very yellow tones and I don't
know I'm just not finding myself
reaching for it very much it's pretty
but again it's too messy
for what I'm just trying to highlight
really quickly I'll use loose powders in
other ways but for my highlight I don't
feel like messing with it so pass that
on this make product it's a skin
illuminator and Leos I haven't even used
this yet let me try it oh my oh it looks
like the Becca oh that's actually I like
this cuz it's not like its own pigment
it's almost it reminds me of
our ms living Luminizer where you see
your skin underneath it's not I don't
know how to describe that but that is
cool so I will try that I was just gonna
get rid of it just because I don't know
I was just gonna get rid of it but now
I'm like maybe I will keep that these my
Couture things I'm just going to get rid
of they're not bad but they're again
they're more work than it's worth you
get a rip one out and get it just in the
spot you want and I'm like I don't have
time for that good buy these this one
I'm going to get rid of this darker one
it's in golden it's their True Match
Lumi illuminator it's like a little
liquid one it's just a little bit too
deep for me I can't wear it as a
highlight
I think L'Oreal sent that to me a while
ago this one I do actually like though
it's a great drugstore option of course
these are really I mean they're not
messing around with the pigment here but
and I know the lights washing out that
other one but I really do like this
formula it stays on it's really pretty
you do have to use kind of a lighter
hand with it so I'm going to keep the
one that would work for my skin tone and
pass on the one that's a little bit too
deep I think these are these is it pure
cosmic a cover effects little like click
things and they're like kind of like
highlight how see that is kind of pretty
this one's in candlelight it's a little
click stick and you have this where is
it this little thing where you can take
the lid off and you literally put one
end in and the other end in and you can
just have it in your purse with two
different shades but I'm never like
carrying that around with me but let me
see if there any shades I want to keep
gilded it's a little bit deeper I think
I'll pass on gilded that's an easy one
this one's in gold dust that one's just
kind of nothing it's just kind of like
being so I'm going to pass that one on
this one's in celestial this definitely
looks more highlighter E that one's
pretty and then this one's in blossom oh
this one's more pink toned might be too
pink I forgot to mention my blush one
this one in berry I accidentally dug my
finger into it it's like a pink one like
maybe just for blush but I don't really
like it
I'm gonna pass that on and I think I'm
gonna pass on candlelight is kind of
pretty but again I think it's too deep
for me but I think I'll keep these two
so the one in celestial and the one in
blossom just because I do think they're
pretty I don't think that the formulas
bad on any of them it's just that some
colors are just ones that I'm not I know
myself I'm just never going to wear I
might go ahead and click keep the click
stick in case I do want to just do it
that way and leave it that way all right
moving forward these are the Mac lustre
drops in pink rebel this is I like this
formula a lot but it's a little bit too
I think deep for my skin tone I've
realized so I think I'm going to pass
that on this Becca one however I can
find a spot full is absolutely gorgeous
actually it reminds me a lot of the Mac
pink rebel I put way too much on but
this one blends a little bit better than
the Mac one does and it looks a little
bit more not I don't want to say natural
because I don't think it looks natural
but it does look better on my skin tone
than this one even though just since
watching they really do look like the
same tone this one's about halfway gone
the Becca one so I am going to keep this
this milk makeup one they recently sent
me in supernova it is bonkers look at
that it's like literally like a purpley
holographic do I ever think I'm gonna
wear it I don't know
but do I want to try it yes because I
have never owned this is the only thing
from Milka that I own currently and I'm
just so intrigued by it so I'm going to
keep it try it out since I just recently
got it this I literally just got in the
mail the other day it's an Oprah
highlighter in Rodeo Drive now here's
what I'm gonna say about it Oh four
highlighters are ridiculously expensive
but you can always get coupons and stuff
I've learned this is one I'd already had
called Beverly Hills that came in a
subscription box and it's so pretty I
mean these are like unbelievable
highlighters so I'm going to keep both
because I love them and this one's brand
new to me but I just I would never pay
full price for them not that they're not
worth it because they're nice the $40
for a highlighter from a brand that's
like I don't know that's kind of
virtually unknown outside of the beauty
world I think it's just kind of
I don't know it's just a lot to me but
yeah I'm going to keep them both though
so last is my hourglass I've saved them
for last because I'm always torn so this
is one of their strobe light ones and
euphoric strobe light this is one called
luminous light and then this is my
ambient lighting trio they all look the
same I know and of course this lighting
is watching like everything out but I
love them all like the strobe light one
is so so pretty it definitely has like a
glitter tone to it this one is really
pretty as well but I feel like I don't
reach for it as much because it's very
similar to dim white and then this I
just love the trio I've had it forever
I'll usually just take a highlighting
brush and just brush through all three
and throw it on so what I'm thinking I
might do is I'm going to keep the strobe
light I'm going to pass this one on
because it's so similar to the dim light
one that I already have I don't think I
really need both and then I think I will
keep a trio so here is everything I'm
keeping here's what I'm getting rid of
it's not as good as my blush room but I
do feel like I can't rid of a lot of
good stuff and some of this stuff is
just you know either new to me that I'm
just dying to try out like the elf one
and this Oprah one or its ones that I've
used for years and I just absolutely
love so it is what it is
the clutters are kind of hit or miss and
this is one that was kind of in-between
it wasn't my best but it certainly
wasn't my worst so and of course I still
need to fix this Becca one here and see
if it's worth keeping or not I have a
feeling it'll be fine when I fix it but
yeah so if you are interested in more
decluttering check out my playlist I've
got tons and tons and tons of them and
of course I've got a ton more coming up
so subscribe so you don't miss those and
I will catch you guys in my next one bye
