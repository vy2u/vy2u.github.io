going to go through these quickly
because these kinds of videos for
eyeliners can just drag on and on my
hand is all stained as I did my lipstick
clutters right before this so if you're
curious that is what is all red all over
my hands so what I'm going to do is the
way I start already clutters I look at
everything I have and I think what would
I buy again so looking at it I would buy
this again but it's just about gone so I
think it's time to just toss this Urban
Decay one this is another one that's
just about gone it's a Lancome one but I
need to just use it up so I'm going to
put that kind of in a pile to keep but I
want to use them up this are these both
the same this anyway when I've been
using up right now but it won't really
sharpen anymore so I'm going to toss
that one this it cosmetics no tough
waterproof is really good it's actually
I'm just going to pass on the Lancome
one because it's just about done I get
frustrated when gets down that hard it's
hard to use because it's so short this
it cosmetics one is actually pretty new
though it came this small it's just a
trial so I'm going to use that one I
would keep this Rimmel scandaleyes one
it's really good it's a waterproof one
so I would totally buy that one again
this next one is pretty good it's their
skinny one I don't think it's like their
best eyeliner in the world but I don't
think it's terrible so I'm definitely
going to keep that one alright so now
let's just go one by one so model
launcher I'm going to pass I think I've
had this for a while it's a bit blue
whenever is something different but I
don't want it it's a blue I'm not nice
it this one I've had for too long it's
by scone tattooed it's pretty good but
it's old this is a Fergie one that
apparently is broken so that's that one
on I think I got from the dollar store
these colored Too Faced liquid Sketch
markers are good but I don't need them
so I'm never going to use them there's a
reason I don't use them yet this is a
deck of scarlet liner called lust and
chocolate I'm just I've got so many I
don't need it I'm a passion Tom Wallace
brand new this one and this elf one are
these two duo ones it's like a shadow
and liner and I don't know I just like
one of these it's like there's like a
kind of grey one called smoke and then
there's actual liner but I just don't
ever reach for them there okay quality
but they're just not my thing
this purple one I'm never ever going to
use this blue one
honestly I'm probably never going to use
it's so pretty though but I'm going to
pass that one on this car lactic one is
super old this steel one is super old
and you pass those on I don't like this
Pacifica one alright its essence
waterproof one is super old alright now
we're getting to the nitty-gritty so
this is a hikari one feels pretty good
is that just black it kind of almost
looks like off black like a little bit
different but I will use that it feels
really creamy
I have three of these to face Sketch
ones this one is I'm that kind of girl
it's charcoal black okay and then these
two are the exact same but it's in black
let me see if this one's like running
out at least people feel pretty good so
I don't see a difference I'm going to
keep all three because I will use them
up for sure I use with the liners pretty
much everyday
this is this L'Oreal infallible sculpt
and it has this weird ball on the end I
don't like it I think it's odd and it
doesn't it's not the way I apply liner
so I don't really like it for that this
is by ciaté London and it's their
fierce flicks it's brand new let me
think about that one this is an SI
Lauder black pencil it's brand new I
would definitely use is the Clinique one
- black - jaw pencil eye again will also
use it's a lot lighter but I like that
on my lower lash line this is like the
only like brownish taupe color again I
like that on my lower lash line by
Lancome and it's in the shade Chloe I
like that I don't like this liquid of a
formula this is by Sigma and it's one of
these kinds of liquid liners and I don't
use it very often so I'm going to pass
that one on this is by beauty for real I
don't mean it's just another black one
the colour-pop one Wow and it's broken
so I'm
passive this is one I haven't even
opened yet by L'Oreal voluminous it's my
favorite kind of salt tip kind of a pen
so I think I will keep this I want to
open it though just the packaging
because it takes up a lot of room in my
collection when I leave it in packaging
and I think I'm going to pass on the
ciate so you're so excited coat needed
so then out of these makeup Beauty is my
favorite one but it's all dried out so
that needs to go this is an elf blue
eyeliner I'm never going to wear to seal
as much fun as the one I'm currently
using it's I honestly don't really like
it but I want to get my money's worth
and just use it up this Rimmel one was
pretty good not my favorite but not bad
but I think I'm gonna pass it on because
it's kind of dried out at this point so
I would say this is not bad I'm keeping
one hot liner and then a bunch of
different flash liners that I'll
actually use and then all of the I'm
getting rid ups and all of that that is
a good feeling because I felt like every
time I needed a new liner I get lost in
my question like why do I have so many
so I feel really good about what I'm
keeping what I'm getting rid of in this
one so if you like these kinds of
declutter this is a much quicker one
that I usually do but I've been doing
declutter videos all day long so I'm
kind of I'm wearing down here but I have
done most of my collection I've been
doing this for years I will link my
playlist below if you're interested and
other than that I hope you subscribe
before you leave and I'll see you guys
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
