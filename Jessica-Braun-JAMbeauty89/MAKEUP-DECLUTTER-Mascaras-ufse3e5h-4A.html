some of them are open most of them are
not so again this is kind of one of
those where I feel like I don't know
that I'm going to get rid of a ton
because if they've never been open and I
haven't tried them you know I obviously
want to try them but let's go ahead and
start so this is one of my favorites
it's actually getting older it's the
covergirl super sizer but it's probably
like two months old so I probably have
another month or so with it so I'm going
to keep it and just use it up but it's
one of it is my favorite drugstore ester
I've ever used so if you're wondering
this is it and it blew me away I didn't
think I'd like it I loved it this it
cosmetics superhero mascara totally blew
me away and right off the bat it was
amazing
just you know really simple spoolie
nothing not special but there's
something about it the formula the brush
everything that my lashes looks so
volumizing curls all day long and is
amazing so definite teeth honestly might
repurchase it again a wolfy but amazing
one that was kind of underwhelming to me
was this roller lash I didn't think it
was like a bad mascara but I kept
wanting it to do something and it never
really did anything so that was kind of
a bummer so I'll get rid of that it made
me sad that I didn't like it but it is
what it is I just it didn't do anything
for my lashes I know so many people
liked it but I don't I don't so I have
two of the it cosmetics tightline
mascara this one is priority opens I
don't know if I have but it's this teeny
tiny oh maybe I have it's this teeny
tiny wand and the idea is that you can
literally get right in between your
lashes and darken that area between the
lashes the tight line area without
having to use liner and for me it really
just kind of works as a mascara primer
because it also just happens to kind of
push your lashes up and separate them as
well so I don't usually use this on its
own but I do like to use it before using
just regular mascara so I'm definitely
keeping both of these these are written
it's a really nice mascara one that I
did not like is this Pacifica one I
mentioned it in
my target brands video where I talk
about the best and the worst of those
brands that are sold at Target Pacifica
is one of those brands and it's just not
a great mascara now this one is not open
so I don't want to open this when I have
to so I want to pass this on while it's
still new because someone might like it
but it just is cute packaging but it
don't form eyelashes I had two of these
L'Oreal voluminous primers and one of
them is open this one yeah it's not bad
it's actually the best drugstore lash
primer I've ever tried the only thing is
because it is white you know you can
sometimes kind of see the white through
the mascara depending on the mascara
formula and over time you know you get a
little bit of blackness on your white
wand which is kind of gross as well so
things to keep in mind I have to however
and this one is brand new so I think I'm
going to keep the one I've already
opened and passed the other one on I
don't need both I don't use mascara
primer each day so because of that I
figure I'll let someone else enjoy the
brand new one and I'll just keep the one
I've already opened another primer I've
had for a while it's the benefit they're
real tinted primer it was just alright I
mean it's brown which I appreciate
because then it doesn't show through
like on underneath black mascara but it
was just okay I fell it didn't feel like
it did a ton I mean honestly these are
probably equivalent that's why I don't
use primers everyday because unless it's
like a standout unbelievable primer if
it doesn't really do much for your
lashes it's not worth taking the extra
step so in this one's getting pretty old
too so I'm going to toss this one this
is very old this is the Tarte I can't
even open it it's one I've had for a
while it just needs to be trashed the
Tarte TARDIS lash paint it was okay
again I couldn't separate my lashes
there we go I can't get open the brush
is just comically humongous and I don't
always mind that but it was just hard to
get my lashes to separate they would
clump and just wasn't my cup of tea so
that one is going in the trash
someone's kind of organized here they
we are open right now so this is another
primer this brand called Grande they
sent me a bunch of their products so
this is their primer and I just started
using it so I'm definitely going to keep
it keep trying it again it has that
white tint I've only used it once or
twice so I don't know how well it really
works yet and then this is their mascara
that goes along with it they're grande
mascara so I didn't love this the first
few times I've used it I like the primer
a little bit more than this but of
course the ideas that you use them
together so I'm going to try to primer
with other mascaras and see how it does
but they also have like a lash serum
that you can you know grow your lashes
longer and more luscious
so I'm trying that out and I will have
to let you know if I notice an actual
difference but I'm going to keep these
to keep trying out alright so this is
the Too Faced better than sex waterproof
mascara I don't think I've ever actually
opened this so it's the only is that the
only is this one waterproof or that one
is too so I have two waterproof mascaras
I've never opened and I kind of want to
keep it that way because until I
genuinely need a waterproof mascara I
want to have it not have to go out and
buy it so I think I'm gonna move on to
both of these considering they're brand
new and just wait until like maybe this
summer for on vacation I know that I'm
going to need something waterproof
alright so I think that most of these
are ones that are completely brand new
this Maybelline one came in like a kit I
got and I haven't tried yet I haven't
really heard anything about I don't know
if it's good or bad but I want to try it
cuz I'm always down for especially
drugstore mascara seeing how they are
especially since I was so surprised by
this covergirl one and how much I loved
it so I'm going to keep it but again
it's kind of in my stash of new mascaras
to try the better than sex one I just
don't love this mascara the waterproof I
don't mind keeping because you know if
I'm swimming and just wanting a little
mascara on which usually I don't but I
don't mind if it's not the most amazing
mascara in the world but regular format
I just don't love it
going to pass that went on brand new
someone will love it so I've got this
clinic I have a couple of clinic ones
they said this is the clinic chubby lash
fattening mascara and this is a clinic
lash power flutter too full mascara I
have not tried any of their mascaras and
I really have been interested in it so I
am going to keep both of these and wait
until I'm ready to open a new one and
these will be kind of in the in the
docket another drugstore one I had at
least like to try this L'Oreal
voluminous saline noir and so this is
instant volume full lash density mascara
so again I really haven't heard anything
about this but they sent it to me pretty
recently so definitely going to try this
out just like that Maybelline one to see
how I like it now some that I don't
really care if I try out or not
would be like this the balm one I've got
so many on back up I don't really need
it some so I might pass this on this amp
lamaze Cara mue lifestyle company I
don't know I mean it might be good but
again this is not what I'm dying to try
so I might pass that one on the this is
the Rimmel volume colorist mascara with
matched into complex I feel like I can
hear the commercial playing in my head
have it open this yet but again another
drugstore mascara I'm always down to try
those to see if they're any good because
if they are then we can all save a ton
of money because I hate spending like
$20 on a mascara that's going to go bad
in like three to five months you know
what I mean
I'd much rather buy one at the drugstore
this is one I've not tried this is the
Estee Lauder sumptuous both volume
lifting mascara again this is one I
actually am intrigued because I've never
tried any Estee Lauder mascaras this
milk makeup one is it Lou bomb a mascara
I'm just intrigued because I don't like
I have I think they're like holographic
stick which I don't know how much you
send me to get out of it but I know
they're kind of a newer brand and I'm
interested to try things from them so
I'm gonna try this as well alright so
now we've got the Vega lash thicker
fuller faster volumizing oh this is a
few
so this just like the other thing I have
so then I'm going to put this like in my
skincare Torah I'm trying that other
brand now the grande one but this will
have to be like next in line because why
not I heard a lot of good things about
these kinds of serums and so I figured
you know if I could find one that really
works then that would be awesome so I'll
keep it but I'm going to put it
somewhere else next is this essay edit
double one is the up and out double
mascara one side is volume one side is
lift
I'm totally intrigued especially since
este edit is pretty new and so far what
I've tried to there is most of the stuff
I've liked some of it just wasn't my cup
of tea but I'm intrigued by this as well
so love and make newer brands and then
this is one perfect ten liquid lash
curler lift curl build prime sculpt
define length and volume eyes condition
strength and no eyelash curler required
hmmm I don't want to like open it but
kind of curious get cute packaging the
wand it looks like it's kind of like
curled a little bit this is a multi
coils curved brush lifts curls to find
Lola find glasses you didn't know you
have so that has a pretty bold claim so
I think I don't hate that
so not totally ideal this is all that
I'm keeping this is what I'm getting rid
of but I do feel like I've kind of
trimmed the fat here some things that
are just old some things that I just
know that are new but I'm not ever going
to get around to using all of these are
news so I've never even used any of
these in this row this is all that I
have open currently and two of them are
primers so this one's going to go bad
soon these have both been very recently
open so I don't feel too bad I'm doing
better about not opening like five
mascaras at the same time because like I
said these two a primer so I'm glad for
that I feel like the last time I did
cluttered I have like nine mascaras open
at the same time I'm like okay this is a
waste of money because they all go
better on the same time once air is hit
them etc so I feel good about that I
feel like oh this one was open to the
little tight lines this domain I'm not
do it as well as I thought but I
definitely don't need to buy any mascara
anytime soon but I do feel like I said
like I've kind of
into the fat which feels really good so
