its future Jessica because I filmed this
declutter before I moved into my new
house at the end of May and in the
shuffle I lost like two-thirds of the
footage so this originally was an entire
collection to clutter now it is I would
say a third of my collection too
cluttered I didn't want to upload this
and I almost said oh my gosh forget it
scrap it but as I went through the
footage I thought this is still valuable
decluttering material so I figured I'd
show it to you
so really all you'll get to see this
time around is some of my pallets you'll
see a lot of my lip products and you'll
see some setting sprays and some powder
so if you feel like some of it is
jumping it would be because I'm missing
footage please know that I love to
cluttering I do it all the time so as
I've moved in I'm planning to film
another declutter perhaps a series so
stay tuned for that if you like these
kinds of videos definitely check out my
past declutter videos which I will link
below and let's go ahead and get into it
so I have all of these Mac matte
lipsticks I'm only going to keep like I
won't wear this I probably probably
won't wear that peach like the berry I
could see myself maybe wearing I don't
want to swatch a bunch because it's
going to take so long
now that's too purple I'm going to pass
these on I could see myself wearing
these and I probably won't wear the pink
so I think I'm just going to keep those
two passes on okay oh I had bad all of
these giveaway things in a bag okay so I
have my Ofra ones which bees let me kind
of space it out these are my absolute
favorite liquid lipsticks of all time so
I know like this red one in Atlantic
City I'm going to keep I love this like
berry one called me although this might
be the one that was ended up being so
dark when I put it on my lips like it
looks pretty in a swatch but it looks
way darker than I thought it would this
might be the one Santa Ana I think is
the one I want to keep instead it's just
a little bit more pinkish very so pass
on Mina this one's a little bit too
purpley it's a little bit too orange
let's see I think Pasadena is the other
one I like
these are all going to stain I like it
but let's see Tuscany
it's also pretty I love this formula
that's a little bit deeper but I do I
think I like that better I like both of
them
this pink ones and charmed that might be
a little bit too pink but let me compare
it to this that is definitely too light
so I'll keep those then pass that on
I've got my Sephora cream lip stain this
this is a Collin prop one that's just
gotten old I'm going to pass it on
I like the balm I actually have a whole
bunch of these I think I'm going to keep
the red I think I'm gonna get rid of
this to each one this is no fur cream
lip stain that I just really like so I
think I'll keep both of these so awesome
I got rid of a decent amount in there
that's not too bad one more thing to
know as I wipe off these swatches is
that I've already packed like things
that I've opened through PR even on
camera and other things I kind of once I
open them I just straight up pack them
right away so there are some things you
won't see either because I've already
packed it or if it's in my everyday
makeup drawer I'm probably not going to
get rid of it so I'm not going to show
that today so if you I'm missing
something that would be one okay so
these are all my drugstore lippies I
have them pulled out cuz I was going to
do a video about them and I think I
still might but I'm going to declutter
it first and that could be before I move
or after I don't know oh I don't even
know where to begin
so my one of my favorite lip products
are these l'oreal infallible paints so
the ones that i have in like wearable
colors i'm keeping them all because
these are my favorite they're so
comfortable there's another one I will
see what I find this is the Charlotte
Tilbury one someone got me I love this
is a Neutrogena one this isn't LA Colors
when I can pass on butter lipstick I
never wears okay I have these tinted elf
lip balms I'm sure there's another one
somewhere in here I love all of these so
I'm keeping them all I genuinely love
and use them all the time I think it's
time for me to pass this YSL one on I
never ever wear it I don't like the way
it looks
so unfortunately goodbye
I have these liquid catsuit
where are they using them okay I feel
like some of them are missing well no
here there so I actually really like
these as well so I think for now I'm
going to keep them I am sure down the
road I will pass them on
maybe I'll pass on pink really hard just
because because one of those Peaks that
I don't know that I will wear yeah I
won't wear that so that one can go
that's an easy one but like the red the
berry and then these nudes I will
totally wear where did it go guys
there it is let me see is this too light
sometimes this color yeah that's a
little bit too peachy so I'll pass that
on I'm going to keep these three this
day glossy is really old I love this
it's just old so I think it's just time
to say goodbye sad to say it these are
these L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
glosses I should think I have a few of
these there's a red I don't really feel
the need to keep this red one wow that
is so pretty though I love this is
another formula I really like I know I
want to keep this one the pink one I
think I want to keep as well
oh no that's too pink that one can go
I think I'll just keep these two these
velvet mooses I love these two the red I
kind of already got so many reds right
like how many rats could I possibly use
this is comfortable but again I don't
think I really need it and you know what
with that in mind I don't think I need
the L'Oreal infallible red one either I
think I can pass those both on so I will
keep these two like those this is one
that I love these are the Revlon Ultra
HD I just have this one in HD sand I
love it
let me swatch it it's so pretty this
videos going so long it's just like the
most normal neutral beautiful color
alright so I have these lip senses I did
a video if you're interested in seeing
it I think I'm going to keep wearing it
and honestly now that I'm realizing it
some of these are in another drawer
you'll see in a second these are not
supposed to be in here these are not
drugstore but I get a video review where
test
that's what these if you're in shouldn't
see I'm going to keep all these for now
I really I actually like it it does dry
my lips out and you'll see that in the
video but I still catch myself wearing
this to work just because it actually
stays on all day so keeping those for
sure I love my Milani keep it smooth lip
balms there's a scrub I love as well
this NYX epic epic ink I've only tried
once I liked the way it looked but it
did wear off weird so I'm keeping it
really just so I can tell you guys about
it in the future the Milani lip oil I
like these provocative kind of surprised
me I liked these a decent amount and I
liked all these colors so I'm keeping
those love my Burt's Bees this one I
like the flower beauty LFL bit matte
this model zone was just okay I'm just
going to pass it on I know I won't end
up using it here's another impossible
where are my other ones to compare just
like the exact same shade once more
pinky once more peachy I think I still
might keep them both though let me see
oh that is that's 316 this one 318 I
still really like both I'm going to keep
oh the trouble on kiss was okay but I
don't need it this elf product is really
old
this grande lips is pretty good I'll
keep it this is not suppose being here
at the by terry lip gloss but I like it
so I'm going to keep it I feel like some
of this just got mixed in my NYX beige
my Kate Moss shade 45 yeah I do like
that keep that I love my color blurs
this is an elf lip topper the total pump
pump is pretty good and I liked this
number seven lipsticks okay let's move
on so let me pull out my favorites this
bite Beauty one I like
I love this color pop one it's just seen
better days oh my gosh it's over but I
love it so much I can't get rid of it
this real her one I'll pass on iffy
Beauty start with the starless one
despite beauty one is kind of like brown
I mean it's kind of like a deeper I
don't know but I don't need it I'll pass
it on this bright paint
never going to wear oh I like my Selah
say all day lipliner that will stay
I like this Mac one in staunchly stylish
I like the Selah one is Kiko one the
Charlotte Tilbury the Milani that's bite
one there's a lot that I like I guess
which is good
Oh Ruby whoo I want to keep 7:14 I want
to keep honestly all of my wet wild ones
I haven't gotten to do a full-on review
I don't know if I'm going to do one or
not yet
but I really like all of them so I'm
just going to keep them all they were
pretty inexpensive this star looks berry
one it's getting pretty cold but it's so
beautiful isn't that gorgeous I'm going
to keep it I don't even know Starbucks
is around this is a deck of scarlet one
that's like a nude color and I'll just
pass it on okay so I got rid of some so
setting sprays honestly a lot of these
are like I love my Milani that all
nighters new to me Kat Von D is new to
me glossy is new to me
forgot two more the master fixed I feel
like I haven't even really tried this
one is very rose scented and it kind of
kills me so I'm going to get rid of this
one the Codel e I've gotten rid of in
the past but I've used it recently and I
really like the way my skin looks after
it even though I like there's alcohol in
it which I know is not always great for
skin but I really liked when my skin
looks so I'm going to keep that for now
this is amazing for travel Fame and then
the tatcha
I spend so much money on so I'm trying
to get my money's worth on this so
really I didn't get rid of many but I'm
going to keep all those I am NOT getting
rid of any of my setting stories and I
know that sounds ridiculous but like
some of these are just my favorite like
the laura mercier and the cover FX I
love the number 7 I love the NARS and
then this one is just a really cool
product from Pixie okay so this is like
a third of my eyeshadow palette
collection right now I don't know that
I'm going to get rid of many like I've
said a million times I've recently
declared I love a lot of these and I
reach for these a lot some of them I
don't love so like for example the Too
Faced peanut butter honey I never ever
wear that is going to go the 24-karat
news I hated I think I only kept because
I just hadn't
yet but I hated this cow definitely
going to go these are two of my favorite
drugstore pallets ever so I'm definitely
keeping those I'm going to be honest I'm
keeping all of my lorac Pro palette all
of my naked palettes these are things
that I invested in and I use all the
time because I invested in them I know
there are a lot of Beauty youtubers that
either I don't know they invested that
they just forgotten their roots but like
to me I'm like these are like my roots
right here like if you face chocolate
bar palette I really like the sweet
peach top these are things that I've
invested money in and I use all of the
time because of that whereas some of
these were sent to me for free and maybe
I don't feel strong of an attachment
because of that I don't know
now I purchased the modern renaissance
in the shade and light I love them both
the toothpaste naturalised is like one
of my favorite eyeshadow palettes of all
time so I'm definitely keeping that
TARDIS Pro is new to me and I love it
the Smashbox double exposure I've only
used by blunter twice so this is still
new to me and I want to keep using naked
ultimate basics I like ball ma petites
one of my favorite tartlet moons one
always here this is one I think I'm
going to pass on I pass on the other at
the Edit last time and this is just one
that I never use it I use it the other
day and I was like ah so I'm gonna pass
it on
these are three brand new flower Beauty
palettes to my collection I've never
even opened them so I'm definitely
keeping those and then these are two
that I love so keeping those as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
