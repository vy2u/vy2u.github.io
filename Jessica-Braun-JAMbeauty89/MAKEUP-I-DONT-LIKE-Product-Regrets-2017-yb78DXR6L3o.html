going to share with you my products that
I have not liked or I regret buying or I
hate it's kind of a you know it runs the
gamut here some of them I purchased so I
do regret buying some of them maybe they
were sent to me and I just don't think
they're very good or maybe I totally
hated them so let's go and get into it
alright got a lot of these negative
videos because I feel like I do a lot of
I'm a very positive person most of my
videos are happy or at least I find some
good things about the product and some
of these do have some good qualities to
them but some of them are just kind of
totally crummy I'm excited alright so
the first one that kind of disappointed
me and that would be the two-faced sweet
peach glow trio I love the packaging of
this but it's $42 and while the
highlight is really really good the
blush is okay and the bronzer is kind of
crummy so it goes from good to bad so
quickly the highlighter I mean really is
stunning the blush like I said is pretty
good and then the bronzer is just like
it's not that it's not pigmented it's
that it goes on really patchy and it
doesn't stay on your face and I feel
like the highlighter is great like I
would buy this highlighter separate it
is stunning the blog's like I said is a
good blush but you can find a million
blushes like this so I don't think it's
worth it for that but the bronzer is so
crummy so I feel like for one really
good product into men's products $42 is
a lot of money I would say for that like
the actual eye shadow palette is really
really good I would recommend that so
what I used on my eyes today and I
actually it's a tutorial with this that
I have and like I said if it's up I'll
link it but I loved that palette spend
$49 on that instead of $42 on this it's
not worth it it's not worth the hype I
just want the highlighter separate
that's all I got this for free from Too
Faced it doesn't matter if I receive the
product for free I'm always going to be
honest with you guys on whether it was
good or not
so speaking of getting things for free
hard-candy sent me this and I loved a
lot of their products I hated this one
it's their look Pro metal eyes and the
idea is that
you've got a mixing medium here in a
little tray and so you can put some of
the mixing medium in here and get the
shadow these like base shadows and mix
it and it's going to be like a really
punchy bright shimmery look no no no and
you also don't need kits like this you
can take any eyeshadow palette in a
setting spray for example for example
one of my favorites is the Milani one
you could use mac's fix+ whatever and
get the eyeshadow on your brush spray it
with that and then it's it's exactly
what this is supposed to do but it's way
quicker no cleanup no little tray you
know the only time I think it would make
sense to use this if the mixing medium
would be if it were a loose pigment but
for something like this it doesn't make
sense they're baked shadows some of them
are better than others like the yellow
gold is pretty rough but they're like
kind of bronzy one is really pretty so
they're not necessarily it's kind of
hair mist just on their own but adding
the mixing medium that really doesn't do
anything with them and it's definitely
not worth even looking at move on heart
candy has a really good eye shadow
palette that I'm trying out right now
that I like they've got way too many
other good products to buy this one pass
right over another product that was so
crummy is this soap &amp;amp; Glory mascara
called thick and fast they're HD
collagen coat mascara it the bristles
are too far apart let me zoom you in and
show you so the bristles are really far
apart and because of that it just ends
up taking your lashes and squishing them
together so you have like three
eyelashes so that's kind of my two cents
on that pass pass test if you're looking
for a drugstore price mascara tried to
covergirl super sizer I really like that
one it's very volumizing it doesn't
clump and it holds the curl next product
so it's disappointing
are these Maybelline master camo
concealer palette there's just nothing
to write home about it's not that these
are so bad that I'm like guffawing how
bad it is it's just that they're just
nothing they're kind of mad they're just
you know some of them are pretty creamy
but the thing is like say I put it on a
blemish somewhere well after a while it
just kind of disappears and even when I
said it it just ends up looking cakey
not
well I would say not in a good way that
almost never looks good but it's just
nothing write home about it's cool that
they have different tones but it's just
not useful because it doesn't look good
on the skin whether it's on your under
eye or on a blemish because it doesn't
stay well it kind of clumps together in
weird ways and it's just all bad
definitely avoid avoidable next products
it disappointed me this might be a
shocker and I also mention them in the
other video I just filmed about products
I've changed my mind about but I want to
mention here too
I've decided that I don't like matte
lipsticks and I might be the only person
in the world I don't know but no way
because they've had all this hype you
know in the packaging so classic Mac but
I think I realize they're just too
drying on my lips I've tried all the
formulas the retro matte the matte the
luster the what else do they have
they've got like 10 million the
amplified that's Matt that's retro matte
I only have three with me I've got like
four floating around my collection and
four other ones I just realize no matter
the finish even like the lesser ones I
love my one in patisserie I love that
shade but it just dries my lip style and
almost instantly and every time I wear
them I never like the way my lips look
for any of the finishes and I've just
realized you know it's not really worth
the 15 ish dollars that they cost rather
go to the drugstore and buy a cheaper
one that does the exact same thing
versus fourteen or fifteen dollars just
for the name tag the name recognition in
the packaging well it doesn't make my
lips feel good it doesn't make them look
good and that's the whole point of
lipstick so I don't know that I'm
necessarily going to get rid of these
right now because some of them I still
like but I always have to put like a lip
gloss on top or you know I have to kind
of work to make it work and I don't
think you should have to do that with a
product like this so I'm including these
as a product that I'm kind of
disappointed by but it's taking me a
long time to get here so the next
product is kind of a wishy washy product
it's the new it cosmetics confidence in
a compact solid serum so it's kind of
basically like a cream foundation kind
of thing but it's supposedly a serum and
it's really creamy I just can't figure
out how to wear it correctly so I'm
still working on this
it's not that it's bad per se it's just
that I've applied it in like four ways
and every single way I apply it looks
horrible I don't know if it's that I
have dry skin because it definitely you
know it's kind of moisturizing but it
can still kind of show some of that I
can get past that but I don't like
applying it with the thing it comes with
I tried it with a brush how I turn it
with a Beauty Blender yet I don't think
I have maybe I'll try that next because
you know it does kind of harden on top
and you have to get your finger in there
to kind of get it creamy again and I
think once it's at that creamy spot I
could probably use a Beauty Blender to
apply it but for right now it's just
kind of in that mezzo so it's not
horrible if you figured out how to a way
to kind of get it to work or maybe you
figured out oh it's only different oily
skin only good for common you know
whatever let us know below because I
know this is new and a lot of people
have asked questions about it and they
sent me all of the colors and I haven't
really found a color that I like this
one's in light but I think it's a little
bit too dark for me but I felt like the
next one down was too light I don't know
so let me know your thoughts below
because this one I'm including at the
very end here because I'm just kind of
mess about it I just don't know how I
feel but I think I might not like it
that make sense so those are all of the
products right now that I either didn't
like or I regretted buying or I was
disappointed by if you enjoyed it I will
link my other dissapointed products
videos below I don't know if I have a
whole playlist but I'll find somebody
recent wants them like them I hope that
you'll subscribe in the meantime to
catch more videos and I'm also sewing
today a video about products that I'm
not going to buy like an anti haul if
you've never seen those kinds of videos
they are really fun to watch they help
you avoid spending money that you
probably shouldn't spend on products you
definitely don't need but I'm really
excited to film that I'm so pumped but I
hope you'll also catch me out on my
social media which is right up there in
the meantime and come say hi and I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
