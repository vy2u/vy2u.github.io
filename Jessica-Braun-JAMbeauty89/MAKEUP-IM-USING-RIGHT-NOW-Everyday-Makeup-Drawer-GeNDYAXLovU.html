my everyday makeup dwarf or I guess it's
September gosh anyway it's almost fall
might as well be fall anyway so I try to
do these every month I'm gonna be honest
it like never happens just because
there's so many videos I want to film
and only so much time to film them so I
feel bad for these kinds of videos they
get pushed by the wayside but I'm here
today to share it with you so basically
I'm sitting on a desk right now and in
this desk is where I keep the makeup I'm
using right now and basically some of
these are new products to me that I'm
trying out or some of them are just
favorites that I use every single day
and I like having them a closed hand the
other place I store makeup is in these
two things here and this is basically my
collection but this is like what I'm
using for that month and I change it
just whenever I don't like always do an
official overhaul sometimes it'll just
be like you know what I'm done trying
these highlighters out let me swap them
out you know what I mean but let's go
ahead and see what's in my drawers so
here is my right drawer
it doesn't look organized it's organized
to me but you know it is what it is let
me sit down and get closer so I can show
you guys so um here I just have like a
little container with some sponges this
is an elf one I've been trying out that
I just don't like in my L'Oreal one that
I really like and then I just got some
like eyelash combs these are these
really cool hair ties I can link below
that don't like pull your hair I love it
sharpener things like that eyedrops if I
need them they're just odds and ends
it's nice to have them all held together
so I have a lot of new products in both
of these that I'm trying out I feel like
it's kind of the season for trying out
new things a lot of new stuff at the
drugstore so I just picked up the Revlon
youth FX fill and blur primer I haven't
even tried this yet I'm really intrigued
by it
so I'll have to let you guys know how I
like it and then I've got this it
cosmetics perfect lighting radiant touch
this reminds me of the YSL you know like
to shake law thing it's nice I've only
used it once
so again I'm just trying it out this I
have not used yet it's another at
cosmetics the bye bye break out I don't
get a lot of breakouts on my skin but I
am curious to see how this works cuz
it's a concealer but it's also a
treatment and so it's got like this
little doe foot but it's in this glass
jar I think that's kind of cool so I'm
really excited to try that you might see
a decent amount of it cosmetics just
because they sent me a whole bunch of
stuff and I want to try it this is there
by my under-eye concealing pot I've used
this twice and I really like it I love
how it's got like an apricot look to it
it's not like totally like you can wear
it on its own but it kind of has that
quality where we kill what dark circles
I meant like get rid of dark circles
kill just came out apparently and then I
also have the cosmetics by my redness
because they finally have a lighter
shade in porcelain beige maybe they
always have but I don't remember them
having it and I like to put this on my
nose because it's a very very very
corrective very pigmented kind of a
product when I put it just on my nose
and then I still put foundation over it
and it usually works pretty well then I
also have the NYX dark circle concealer
I haven't even opened it oh now it's
open that's fine so this one is
definitely a little bit peachy err than
the cosmetics one but I'm really excited
about that for dark circles next is this
from soap &amp;amp; Glory it's their Hocus focus
instant visual floss softening
illuminator I am just excited to give
this a try I haven't tried it on my face
I've only like swatched it but it's
really really pretty so you can mix it
with stuff you can put it on underneath
you can put it in targeted areas but
just a really pretty illuminating cream
and I'm just i like products like this
and I think the packaging for is kind of
cute this is one of my favorite can not
concealers one of my favorite
foundations by G paunchy it's so
expensive you guys but I love it the
shade I'm wearing that's perfect for me
is perfect praline but if I'm self tan I
wear number six this is number five this
is too light for me however but the
formula seemed really nice it's a Revlon
youth effects fill and blur foundation
SPF of 20 but they didn't have the shade
darker that I needed but I'm really
really liking the formula it feels
really like high coverage it definitely
has a little bit of a fragrance it
smells good but if you're sensitive to
that you might want to stay away so I'm
excited to try that out more but I well
I guess really I need to just return it
and get the other shade another
foundation I'm really liking lately is
this at cosmetics by bylines foundation
it is a freaking amazing I wear the
shade light typically and it's just like
the most flawless but natural foundation
it's really cool it reminds me of this
this look wise but the formula is very
different this I haven't tried it's The
Naked skin one and done hybrid
complexion Perfector I have the shade
medium light for right now
I love tinted moisturizer so I am
excited to try that the charged water
I'm also trying I'm sorry I feel bad
like I feel like I can't review these
yet but this is honestly what I'm gonna
be using so I wanted to show you
honestly but a lot of this is new it's
the Mac mineralize charged water so I'm
excited to try that I'm not even sure
how to use that to be honest with you
but I found it for really cheap on
HauteLook it was like 50% off so is like
ooh so I just want to try one of my
favorites the mattifying missed from
volition which is a new brand at Sephora
it is incredible in the mister is
amazing oh my gosh I used it today I
went getting ready another product I use
every single morning it's the elf beauty
shield vitamin C pollution prevention
serum it is like this really liquidy
kind of serum but I put it on every day
all over my face and I just love I feel
like it's so protective against the
elements things like that you do still
need a sunscreen though because this is
not a sunscreen then I've just got my
clinic pep star eye cream I'm trying to
work through I don't think it's anything
special this is the Urban Decay urban
defense this one does have SPF of 30 and
I really like it it's one of those make
sure skin feels like feel like a baby's
bottom but it does a great job of
holding on a foundation I was really
impressed because I'd heard kind of
wonky things about a lot of Urban
Decay's primers but I really like this
one and I have my handle a lip treatment
one of my favorite lip balms and my
glossy priming moisturizer I pulled back
out because I wanted to use this up as
moisturizer I like
I think it's actually really really good
will I repurchase not right now only
because I have so many moisturizers work
through so that is everything in this
chore so this is my left drawer did I
say that was my right this I got from
the Container Store I love it's got a
square a longer part and then a smaller
rectangle and I think it's an awesome
organizer for drawers like this and the
desk by the way I just got it on
HauteLook I buy everything I own from
home I anyway okay so another big mix
here I've got the balm at last one of my
favorite mascaras I was so impressed
with it like so impressed cuz a lot of
you guys kept telling me just try it and
I finally tried it and I was like dang I
should have tried that long ago and I
have my pretty vulgar eyebrow pen pencil
I really really like I have the shade
quick wit which is kind of like a cool
toned Brown then I have my pixie pad
away concealing base it's supposed to be
reminiscent as far as I'm concerned to
the Tarte shape tape but it is a thinner
consistency than the Tarte shape tape
but it's always really good coverage so
far I'm impressed with it and then I
also have the pixie lower lash mascara
it's one of those like teeny tiny wands
really good for catching like every
little lash I use it on my upper lash
too sometimes this is a an eye primer
I'm trying out it's the pure get-a-grip
eyes shadow primer it's just good I mean
it's a standard beige toned primer but
it does a great job do I think you need
to spend the money that pier charges no
I think you can just get them alot in
one it's about the same I always have my
elf makeup remover pen so if I'm doing
winged liner or anything like that I can
clean it up really quickly I have my
Rimmel scandaleyes waterproof liner it's
a cold liner or Kajal it's amazing
absolutely amazing I also have my Kat
Von D tattoo liner I'm trying to use up
it's I think it's good it's not my
favorite liner I think the NYX epic ink
liner is exactly the same but a way
better formula but the same kind of a
brush my Holy Grail liner my hourglass
1.5 millimeter it's a mechanical one it
can do really thin lines it's incredibly
black incredibly creamy I run out of it
so quickly it breaks my heart but I love
it it's worth every penny
here I have some staples of mine my wet
and wild single shadow and Brule is an
amazing cream-colored shadow I use it
almost every day my Bobbi Brown
corrector it's just like a peach toned
concealer I use all the time for my
under-eye my pretty vulgar gel liner is
amazing amazing amazing so I use that
every day this one's actually new to me
I don't think I've used I found got it
on HauteLook again Mac was on sale it's
kind of a deeper kind of grayish tone
beige it's a cream shadow and I really I
like their Paint Pots I actually have
Indian wood ooh Indian wood here if you
saw my five-minute makeup tutorial you
saw me talk about Indian wood and how
amazing it is it's just this gorgeous
kind of bronze e tone it's so pretty all
over the lid like I'll go out often with
just that on my lid it's so pretty just
off my RMS living Luminizer it's kind of
like this dewy highlighter it's just so
not natural-looking but kind of dewy and
glossy and I just tap it on my
cheekbones and it looks so pretty it's a
great alternative if you don't want to
use like powder liner things or powder
highlighter this is another corrector
from laura geller they have these
different colors I've only used it like
once so I'm wanting to use it up some
more but it's it's a lot thicker than
I'm used to for corrector like crazy
thick so I'm intrigued to try it some
more it seems maybe too thick oh I have
these elf mineral pearls in their skin
balancing I've never tried so I'm
excited to try those one of my favorite
bronzer is the Too Faced milk chocolate
Soleil it's a little bit light for me
right now I might swap this out for the
chocolate Soleil so that's everything in
that section and then over here I have
some stuff that's new to me in some
favorites this was one of my August
favorites the NYX lingerie this isn't
the shade pushup
I have it on my lips today it's just so
pretty it looks a little deeper on my
lips because my lips are pigmented maybe
more pigmented than most but I love the
formula I love the shade it just kind of
feels like it's one with your lips and I
love it this is the master camo I've
talked about in a lot of recent videos
it's this totally peach toned corrector
for your like under-eye and I really
like it but you do up
put concealer on on top of it when you
use it and then I have this lipstick
from ardell it's their hide your
lipstick this is in the shade tropic
hotspot and I think that shade is
freaking amazing isn't that unbelievable
oh so I'm really excited to have that
and the formula is so creamy this is the
Revlon it's that same youth effects line
it's their fill and blur concealer it's
super creamy I have only used it like
one so I can't really tell you exactly
how I feel about it yet this is the elf
natural glow lotion I like this a lot
but I it's it's very like kind of
alarming the first time you put it on
but when you put something on top of it
it just looks so healthy so I really
like it for that purpose I don't think
this is something you could use just in
targeted spots because I don't think it
would do enough and I think it's too
moisturizing for that but I do like it
and then I have these elf like
highlighting sticks targeted natural
glow sticks I have this one and I use
this all the time on my cheekbone
I just love products like this that's in
the shade pink pearl glow and then this
one's in fresh morning dew and it's a
lot more like glossy like it's almost
clear but it's really pretty too it's
kind of similar to living Luminizer
nothing quite and then I have the bye
bye redness powder from it cosmetics
I've never used I think I actually I
think I might have thrown that on my
face today now that I'm thinking about
it but it's just a you know a powder
we'll see if it really gets rid of
redness and then I also have this Milani
highlighter in here I just felt like I
wasn't getting enough use out of its the
strobe light and its really really
pretty
oh it's so pretty isn't that gorgeous so
I'm really excited to have this out here
so over here is this elf aqua Beauty
shadow palette it's in the island breeze
and this is like a cream to powder kind
of a thing kind of like color pop but I
still think it's still different
that one's credibly pigmented but like
other ones are not as much so it's kind
of hit or miss
but I haven't actually put this on my
eyes I just keeps watching it so I want
to try it especially that cranberry I
think is really pretty for fall and then
these over here from Marc Jacobs their
glam Bishan palette I've been using a
lot I mean these are just beautiful
shadows absolutely gorgeous and I love
that they actually have the shades I
would need to blend things together I
really appreciate that
this one's in scandal lust and again I
love this sugar here is so pretty for
fall I mean oh my gosh I love it so that
is everything in this drawer I hope that

Jessica come on get it together I had to
pull my hair back and then I took it
