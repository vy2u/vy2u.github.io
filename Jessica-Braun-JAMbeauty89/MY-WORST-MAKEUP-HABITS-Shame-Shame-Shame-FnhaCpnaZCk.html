share with you my bad habits so this is
actually video I've been planning for a
while but as I really thought about like
I really do have like quite a few bad
habits when it comes to either doing my
makeup or just something to do with my
makeup routine there are things that are
kind of frowned upon in the community
but I do them anyway
and I know I'm not alone in some of
these so I want to hear from you guys so
I don't feel alone which of these bad
habits do you also do maybe you have
other bad habits and the reality is I
thought I've about five of them but I'm
sure that the second I'm done filming
this I'll think of like three more like
oh yeah I do this oh yeah I do this but
let's go ahead and get into this
so my first bad habit I talked about
before and by the way I've seen other
youtubers do this kind of a video first
really big bad habit not washing my
brushes I mean I do wash them but I've
got a horrible habit /system
where I use the brushes for a month and
as I'm getting ready and using them I'll
pull in more and then eventually I'm
like okay my right now I'm kind of
keeping mine in this little thing
you saw them in my longer elf one but
it's white and I would get makeup all
over it and I can't get the makeup off
so I'm like I'm done I don't like
looking at it when I'm trying to clean
it and it still doesn't look clean it
drives me crazy so I've kind of narrowed
it down to this and so when it gets
really full takes them out and I've got
a little tray in my closet where I keep
all my dirty brushes and while that's
not a horrible system I will go months
without cleaning them because they'll
just sit in there and so for all I know
they're like reading bacteria and
they're all sitting together so it
always feels very good when I really
clean them now I've never noticed
anything like when I'm getting ready
with these brushes especially after I
clean them again I've never noticed like
weird breakouts or anything scary like
that but certainly a habit that I need
to wash my brushes more often because
when I finally do I've got way too many
and it's such a big deal whereas if I
did it like once a week then it would be
you know just a handful of brushes it
wouldn't be that big of a deal but I
gotta break that habit but then there's
people in my life I know that like never
wash theirs cuz they're not big into
makeup and I'm like can I wash your
brushes for you like I'm not gonna
name names of people in my life but
certain people I'm like oh my gosh
you've never washed this like you'll
look at their brush and it's just like
in like three giant pieces I'm like oh
my gosh okay
another really about how that I have is
with a wet sponge I will go into well my
favorite thing to do is to go into a
powder foundation and use it to apply
because first of all talk about like the
most perfected look on your skin it
really is I don't know how I discovered
it but it was about a year ago that I
did and now I do it all the time and I
do it specifically with my favorites my
it cosmetics celebration foundation
elimination powder foundation it's my
favorite but I always feel like I get a
little bit of hardpan like I've got a
little bit there in the middle that I
always have to scrape off because of my
bad habit now they do sell wet and dry
powder so I've got one from NYX that I
do like a lot that it's meant to be he's
wet and dry so it doesn't end up forming
hardpan it dries and it's no big deal
but this is still my favorite and I
still use it with this all the time and
the reality is I go through this quickly
enough but I'm not too concerned but at
the same time I'm like probably every
time I do it I'm like I feel guilty like
oh my gosh okay I'm very guilty of this
this is more of a forget okay okay so
what I'll do is I will do my foundation
concealer etc then I'll do my brows on
my eyes then at the very end I'll go in
with my blush bronzer highlight and then
I'm done okay so with that in mind
sometimes after my foundation before I
start on my brows and eyes I'll go ahead
and use a powder foundation or maybe
even a loose powder to kind of set my
face before I start my eyes well then
when I'm done with my eyes and I go in
to do my bronzer or blush or highlight
sometimes I'll want to use a cream
product and I don't think about how
Jessica you've already powdered your
face
that cream is not gonna work on top of
that powder very well and then I'll do
it be like oh crap like it looks crazy I
do it all the time I did it recently in
a video I was trying a like a liquid
blush out from butter LONDON and I
like it and I've tried it since then I
still don't like it even without but my
idiot self powdered and then trying to
put that on top of it and it looked
really crazy and that's part of the
reason why I know in the end like I said
I still didn't end up liking it trying
it the next few times the right way but
it's such a bad habit that it's really
more me just being forgetful like oh
yeah I've already powder but it's one
that I need to work on oh my gosh
pulling on my eyelid while I do my liner
oh and I know a lot of you guys say dude
I do it too some of you guys are like
I'm 50 I'm 60 I've been doing it for
decades and I don't have any weird extra
wrinkles because of it so it makes me
feel a little bit better but I will pull
on my eyelid to do like my wing I have
to I literally have to I have tried not
doing it and it has the most horribly
comical results of me having no idea how
to do it like I cannot do it without
doing it so that's just me I've tried to
break to have it I literally can't
so oh does anyone else when you're
putting on mascara why am i using a pen
to pretend I can anyway let's pretend
this is my mascara when I'm putting it
on
does anyone else have like the ugliest
face I'm like like I can't I have to
have my mouth open does anyone else do
that I there's no way I'm alone but I
feel like when I am filming and I am
putting on mascara I try to be so
conscious of me going look my mouth open
but I'm sure there are many times that I
just do and I'm like well it's so
engrained in me to have my mouth open
while I do my best scare so this video
is just for fun I know it was a quick
one but those are kind of my five bad
makeup habits shame on you Jess but I'm
curious of what your bad habits are let
me know down below I think this is just
gonna be fun if you're another youtuber
I tag all of you guys to do this I think
this is so much fun and other than that
I will see you guys in my next one oh
