have my updated makeup collection for
you all and this is chock-full of some
organization tips and some different
places that you can go and find really
inexpensive ways to store your makeup
and hopefully this is helpful for you
all and I'll catch you in just a second
so here is where I get ready each and
every morning and I'll go ahead and give
you an overview shot and then I'll go
ahead and go in detail so this is how I
store my nail polish it's just in a
spice rack that I got from the Container
Store for under ten dollars that's a
great place to find things like this and
really repurposing you know it might be
a kitchen storage item but why couldn't
you use it for nail polish you know so
I've got my ESI's here in the front I
kind of organize them by brand for right
now because I don't have so many that I
need to do it by color I can really see
like if I'm craving pink I can see
there's some pink there's some pink
there you know and I just like the way
it looks to be honest so Essie
I love the Sally Hansen salon manicure
lines why I have so many plus my
subscribers are good to me and they
always send me awesome nail polishes
I've got some of the Sally Hansen insta
dries I'm OPI nail polishes they're in
the back that I like Orly Nicole by OPI
there's all kinds of random ones and one
that I've fallen in love with lately are
these oil ones I only have one and I
love it so I want to get more but I
always use this as a gauge where if this
gets filled up and I'm trying to buy
another one I make myself get rid of
another because I don't want to have so
many nail polishes that I can't even fit
them in this I already have too many so
then here I've got this lamp that my mom
actually got me from Walmart I just
think is so cute and simple and here
I've got my perfume I have Miss Dior
which is my absolute favorite and then
I've also got Viva La Juicy and
Flowerbomb by Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf and what I
have here is just I think it's an
octagonal little is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 yes
from a craft store I think it was from
Michaels or Hobby Lobby one of those
types of stores and it was like 3 or 4
dollars you can even find these at the
dollar store lately and it's just such a
pretty way to store your perfume or
anything like that because it just adds
that little extra bit of whimsy so here
I've got my Muji 5 drawer that I finally
went ahead and splurged on I think it's
under $30 with shipping but even still
you can find cheaper ones of these
HauteLook sometimes will have
similar products you can find things
like this at TJ Maxx and Marshalls but
I'll go ahead and dig into the gorge and
show you what I've got okay so in this
drawer I've got my Rimmel show-off lip
lacquers I have some Revlon lip butter
no lip balm stains some NYX ones a new
fur key one which is interesting Ulta I
mean all kinds this is an Estee Lauder
one a Canadian subscribers thing to me
and then here I've got my lip liners I
have a couple from Mac I've got a Pilate
oh one a NYX one one from Star looks
that I haven't even used things like
that so that's kind of where I keep all
of those second drawer
I've got my color whispers here a lot of
different shades one of my favorites is
lust for blush then I have my Revlon lip
butters and then this is a Mirabella
sweet velvet lip pencil and then over
here I just kind of keep all my lip
balms and things like that
so I have an EOS balm stick that they
saw on targets website aqua for some
blistex the sugar one this is I have a
few co Bigelow products this is their
menthol lip shine that I really like and
then also their original rose self
smells so nice and rosy in the third
drawer I've got my L'Oreal infallible
shadows my favorites and then I also
have just a ton of single shadows and
there's like I think one duo but
otherwise everything these are all of my
single shadows so sometimes I'll buy a
single shadow in my favorite color
that's in a palette for example this is
Urban Decay half-baked which is such a
beautiful color but if I want to bring
it with me when I travel I would have to
bring the whole palette so I found this
on an Instagram sale for really really
cheap like three dollars because it was
an old packaging anyway so I also have
this is actually a Mac pigment this is a
color tattoo pigment but otherwise I've
got some wet-and-wild some covergirl a
sigma one of Charles of the Ritz is one
of my favorite I mentioned in a lot of
videos I try to keep this whittled down
so it doesn't get too out of control
because I don't reach for these as often
as I would reach for a palette so in the
fourth drawer all I have are my two
naked palettes I don't even need to pull
it out that's what I keep in there in
the fifth drawer this is where I keep
products that are new to me or that I'm
trying to try out for the first time so
this is a stay matte powder in a lighter
shade that I just gotten in Influenster
box so I want to try the
in this proper shade some other things
I've gotten in starlooks boxes right
here these I just bought at Assisi oh
this is mat full of joy this is Mac
taupe shape and then a palette that I
actually didn't get that recently well
no it was pretty recent but I just
haven't been using it so I want to make
myself use that some Rimmel liners that
I got from Rimmel and I need to try out
a nick shadow and then a subscriber sent
me this Ulta lip pencil I just haven't
opened and tried it yet so I wanted to
keep these in here I have noticed that
when I keep products in these drawers
here in front of me I tend to use them
more often so I really do like that for
that reason alone up here is where I
keep a lot of my everyday products as
well as my favorite lipsticks so I've
got my vitamin C renewal cream which is
by Avalon organics that it's just one of
my favorites I use this at night during
the day I use this pur Lisse one got my
the only natural deodorant I've ever
tried that I actually like by crystal
then I've got my Mogador nurturing eye
cream mac fix+
my josie maran argan oil this is the elf
daily brush cleanser but i actually
refilled this with alcohol just to spot
clean my brushes once i ran out of the
elf and it's perfect for that this is
the hand cream i'm using right now which
is the market peach one from Bath and
Body Works and then also from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works the twisted peppermint hand
sanitizer I use I love the smell of this
and I got it on clearance after
Christmas and this is a nine lipstick
holder that I got from Marshalls
Marshalls and TJ Maxx are a great place
to find little things like this I think
I got it for three dollars and you can
always find great deals on storage from
there so I have four different masks
these are three Sonia Kashuk ones that I
just adore and then my favorite
lipsticks are the best ma cosmetics ones
they're just beautiful packaging this is
the shade exotic pink I just love I just
love them this is where I keep my
brushes that I'm using currently which
is most of my brushes you'll see there's
a few that I'm not using that I have
elsewhere this holder I also got from
Marshalls for I think $12.99 maybe it
might have even been less than that but
it's great because it spins it's got six
different areas to hold brushes and I
kind of have them organized these are
all my eye brushes here
so I've got some from Real Techniques
clearly I need to give my brushes a wash
some from Sigma this is from a set call
from a brand called Altair which I did a
whole review video on their whole set
and it's really cheap the whole set is
like twenty dollars but it's pretty good
and then these are my more detailed
brushes for face so these I use like
four sips some elf stippling brushes
more real techniques things like that
and then here I've got my these are more
like bronzer and blush brushes so I've
got the elf stipple brush my favorite
this is actually the Real Techniques
expert face brush that I love using for
foundation my hand Ibuki from bare
essentials things like that here are
where I keep my beloved Sigma brushes
these are all the foundation ones but my
favourite brush that if I die no if I
lost all my brushes this would be the
first one i pre-purchase it's the Sigma
f80 six it's their tapered kabuki and
this gives the most flawless concealer
look under your eyes I've ever seen and
what's weird is it it makes it flawless
no matter what the concealer is I don't
know how it does it it's like it
transforms everything I've never owned a
brush like this and it's unbelievable
and this is one that I would repurchase
time and time again if I had to it's
worth every penny I love it
I'll have a link for these below if
you're interested but that's the f-86
and then these are my outer brushes I've
got a Sonia Kashuk one and a Real
Techniques and these are my blush
brushes some from out there that I love
and then an elf one and then lastly I've
got and lastly I've got this mirror it's
a light up mirror it's got a plug in the
back which I love because I can plug in
my you know curling wand or whatever I'm
using that day right into the mirror you
know this picture of my boyfriend and I
in Disney World our favorite place and
this frame I got from Marshall so I just
think it's so cute and of course you've
got to have a candle this one I got at
Target on clearance what else is new I
get everything on clearance but I just
love the Sun of it it's the scent
vanilla amber it just smells wonderful
so now that you guys have seen a full
overview of the top of my dresser drawer
I guess I should tell you about the
actual desk I'm use
this is a tabletop and then it's got two
different drawer systems on the side so
the piece that I use are actually two
separate pieces from Ikea so that one
here and that one there is a matching
one and then I ordered a tabletop
separate from Ikea I'll have links for
all of the info below but yes I did end
up getting the two separate pieces in
the tabletop the only way that they're
connected actually is it just sits on
top of it there's I didn't drill any
screws or anything because frankly if I
ever wanted to use these pieces separate
and then have a different desk I didn't
want to have holes in the top of it so I
actually just use since I'm a teacher I
actually just used sticky tack so that
it doesn't slide around at all but I can
adjust it if I need to and it doesn't
leave any marks so it really has worked
out well the chair is one that was given
to me by a friends but let's go ahead
and dig right into the actual drawers so
here is an overview of my first store on
the left side which is basically
concealers and liners and primers so the
holder that is in it is actually from
Marshall's it was like $7 like I said
it's a great place to get things like
this so right here I have my like cream
shadows one from Sigma and persuade I
love some color tattoos a benefit one an
RSVP which is absolutely gorgeous I've
also got my eye primers here which is
the shadow insurance wet and wild elf
sharpener and Estee Lauder teal liner
that a subscriber something I love and
then back here I've got my dr. Brandt
primer I've never even tried pregnant
poreless professional and Smashbox there
and then here I have some concealer
setting powders I've got an elf HD one a
Tarte one and then I've got my concealer
so I've got benefit erased paste and
then from my Mac Pro Longwear here I
actually use like this is just like a
random little thing and I use the lid to
squirt out the excess because the pump
is really one pump you is good enough
for two to three applications like two
to three different days and then I've
got my Rimmel match perfection like I
said my Mac Pro Longwear and my Oh
wonderful hard candy glamoflauge that I
love and then I also have the Rimmel
wake me up the instant age rewind and
brightener that I love some Lauria want
a Maybelline one and this is one from
Avon or Mark I guess and then here I've
got liners I've got some Rimmel
Physicians Formula Jordana these are
like my Black's Browns and nude down
here I have more colorful one so some of
my Jordana ones that I love Palladio
this is more like a shadow stick from
covergirl in essence so this drawer is
quite empty actually I have my like
smaller shadow palettes and then some
setting sprays and some mascaras so
palette wise I have an Archie's girl one
Apple audio one covergirl Sonia Kashuk
and then another wet and wild one and
then I have my all nighter setting spray
and then some mascaras I have open I
just got rid of a bunch I had way too
many open but they were all old so I got
rid of them here I've got some empty Mac
palettes I've got a quad a duo and then
in the boxes are the insert and the big
Pro palette one and then I also have an
elf makeup mist and set and then this is
the urban decay D slick just small one
so the containers in here this is from
Dollar General and they had a bunch of
different sizes you'll see this was from
I bought it at a store near me called
Meyer but it was like a jewelry holder
so you can always look in jewelry
sections to see if there are organizers
there they work great for makeup and
then this was from the Dollar Tree they
have a bunch of different sizes you'll
see some more of these and by the way
the liners and all of these drawers are
also from the Dollar Tree so in the
third drawer I have a completely random
mixture of things so here on the side I
have all of my palettes I've got some
wet and wild ones here my Naked basics
palette my Shady Lady from the balm
palette cabana glamma
a Mac one by Rebecca Moses and then I
also have a star looks one that I love
and then also my Mac palette that's
filled with everything but Mac shadows
know I've got a lot of elfs shadows in
here some Mac wants some benefit ones
and the thing that's holding them is
another one from the Dollar Tree just a
really large one it works well in these
deeper drawers so in the middle here I
have a bunch of lipsticks that didn't
fit in my Muji 5 drawer but I love these
just the same so this is a holder from
by allegory that they sent to me and I
was shocked by how well made these are
24 lipsticks and in it I keep my Milani
ones L'Oreal ones julep some of my Kate
Moss ones that I love here are a bunch
of starlooks ones L'Oreal
another one of my favorite Sonia Kashuk
ones Revlon and then these are some
other ones I haven't even tried yet NYC
and a model Co one that I'll be trying
out soon so then right here on the side
I've got another one of these smaller
holders from the Dollar Tree that holds
my foundation that I'm not that's not in
my everyday drawer that you'll see I've
got mashed perfection magic Lumi some
Revlon Colorstay covergirl one and they
also have my new Revlon Colorstay
whipped that I love so right here I have
my extra brow product so I have some
brow pencils some brow gels that I'm
gonna be using soon all kinds of things
like that and then in the middle here
I've just got some random things because
I didn't have a place for him my ELF HD
powder in yellow some Carmack's back
here in one of these Dollar General
holders I've got a bunch of face lotions
and things like that a lot of sunscreen
ones that I use more in the summer
season during the year too but this is a
josie maran wand a Lancome one or back
there it's like dark back there I know
got a Estee Lauder serum that a
subscriber sent me that I love and then
I've got my Clinique one here to the
side as well all kinds of different ones
in the fourth drawer down is kind of my
no-nonsense stuff I've got some makeup
cleansing wipes I always get at Big Lots
this is a sixty pack for two bucks
they're great I don't really use them
necessarily for my face I use them to
wipe off swatches which I'm trying to be
better about if you've watched my videos
for any length of time you know that I
always forget and then I make a mess
tissues here I've got some body creams
that I've been using my favorite vanilla
bean Noel I love a deodorant that I'm
not really using at the moment dr.
Bronner's magic all in one coconut oil
that um you can use so many different
ways so I like having that I got that
from vitacost and then in here this was
just a Victoria Sea gift secret gift box
and I actually just keep hair stuff in
it just a ton of hair stuff I love
having a place just to kind of put it
away so I'm not seeing it all the time
because I don't use it all the time but
I like to have it somewhere kind of kept
neat so down here I have my nail care
drawer right here I've got cotton pads
and q-tips of course and then I've got
my nail files and other nail nail tools
and I also have a pump and go type of
polish where you pump it onto the thing
from CVS

dollar general holders I've got little
like hand creams to go along with when I
give myself a manicure a bunch of base
coats and top coats some glittery top
coats and then my OPI minnie mouse
collection but they're all tiny so I
just leave them in here and then I've
got my pedegg some cuticle products and
some buffing little things these are
nail polish and remover pads for like
when I travel you know and then here I
just have some extra nail things that I
probably will never use and that extra
cotton rounds back there now on to the
next set of drawers on the right side so
if you've been watching me any length of
time you would know that I do everyday
makeup drawer videos where once every
couple weeks I completely change what's
in here and I'm choosing products to put
in here that I use every day because I
love them or they're new and I want to
try them or they got kind of lost in my
collection I want to make sure that I'm
using them so this is a really fun
drawer for me because I do update it all
the time and it always looks different
but for right now you'll get a peek into
what it looks like right now here I've
got my Anasazi brow powder and medium
brown that I used this is an eye primer

bathroom organization and then back
there I just have some 3d white strips a
contact lens holder and then what else
do I have
Oh a kabuki brush and things and this I
got at the Dollar Tree it's just a
little holder so this is one of my
favorite drawers and it's my blush
bronzer highlight and powder drawer well
this organizer right here on the right
is Bai Bai allegory and the same place
that I got that make the lipstick one

never seen one like that and again it's
really thick and well made but I've got
my Tarte blushes here then I have my Mac

back there and then I also have my

my few highlighters I actually don't own
many I just have the mary loumanizer
this wet and wild one and another wet
wild one that's my favorite then this
holder is another Dollar Tree one and
these actually connect to each other if
you have a bunch of the same kind they
have different size and you can connect
a bunch of different sizes which is cool
I've got my bronzers here so I've got
like a Too Faced chocolate Soleil
pixee one hula a covergirl 1 the Tarte
Park Avenue princess and then a Sonia
Kashuk cream one and then these are like
my loose powders I've got a Pilate Oh
rice powder and this one's from Mary Kay
and then back here I have two Rimmel
stay matte once in two different shades
and then to Nick stay matte but not flat
ones in two different shades I'm making
a mess here in this third drawer down
with my haircare drawer so in the front
I have two of the smaller version of the
Dollar Tree holders and I hope my hair
ties and my bobby pins and this is just
a travel bobby pin holder my friend
amber sent me so I just keep it in there
because it has more bobby pins in it and
then I've got two different things to
hold my hair back when I'm doing my
makeup and then I also have like a
teasing comb things like that and then
on the side here I have my Peter Coppola
hair brush and I'll put this this is
actually a dish drying mat I got from
the Dollar Tree for a dollar and clearly
needed buy a new one but I wash it all
the time but I use this on the top of my
vanity when I'm getting ready that way I
can wipe brushes off if I need to just
for a sec or just catching all my you
know powders that are flying things like
that I have my curling wand here my
brush which you already saw here's where
I keep all of my day-to-day hair
products of course I don't use all of
these every single day but I've got like
batiste dry shampoo hairspray L'Oreal
Moroccan oil that I really don't like a
bain de ter detangling spray I love
matrix heat protectant shine spray from
suave L'Oreal boost it that's great I
have some like when I straighten my hair
which is not as often and just some
other things that I just don't use as
often but it's good to have the fourth
drawer is filled with products that I
haven't used yet that are unopened
either they're backups or I don't want
to you know like mascara is there on the
right I don't want to open a ton of
mascaras at a time so those are just
kind of waiting in the wings and in the
very back which I won't show you beyond
those extra dry shampoos is giveaway
stuff so I'm not going to show you that
stuff but up here I can show you this
these are all unopened mascaras I've got
some em two-faced bad gal lash L'Oreal
Rimmel covergirl I mean just a ton of
different ones that I haven't tried the
l'oreal butterfly one and this holder
was just from the dollar store as a
packet too and then here I've just got a
bunch of random like
is a dry shampoo this is the next hair
oil I'm gonna be using and then I've got
some travel things under here is where I
keep rushes that I'm not using currently
but that I don't want to get rid of just
yet because I think I will you know I've
got some body sprays and a body roll on
and then in here this is kind of a tip
these are all perfume samples and I use
when you buy a strapless bra from
Victoria's Secret or even strapless
swimsuits and they come with straps as
well they'll come in a little bag like
this and I like to use this to hold
little things like this all together so
these are the perfumes and samples that
I still have I had a bunch but I
decluttered and I just keep them in here
so they're easy to find they're all
together and I just think it's a cute
way to reuse that right in here which is
another Dollar Tree one I've got all my
hand sanitizers and tissue and hand
sanitizer holder Vaseline and then that
pink box there was in the target dollar
section which is the target dollar
section it's another great place to find
things that can help you organize so
I've got extra earrings company sent me
a bunch of hand creams and then actually
a backup of my Mac Studio Fix thing
these are eyelashes I just stuffed a
bunch in here there's two or three pair
in here because I don't use them often
but I just want to keep them all
together and one of these pairs came in
this and then I also just have extra
beauty wedges some Halloween silly paint
type things a mirror and then like I
said beyond those extra backup dry
shampoos is give away stuff that I can't
show you that the last drawer is my
candle drawer and these were a set that
my brother got me I've got some plugins
these are all my tarts in another one of
those Target dollar store section
containers these are some of my
favorites you can get these at Walmart I
think for a couple bucks and you can
only use one or two at a time
whereas with the Yankee Candle ones you
can cut them up into pieces but I find
myself ending up just throwing the whole
thing in there but I love tarts I've got
more candles a market peach one some
Christmas ones from Bath and Body Works
and that I love some folders and as you
go farther back you'll see I've got some
scent portable things there some
Wallflower plugins extra candles and in
the very back there I have a winter and
a fall little giant candle holder that I
don't use obviously in the spring I need
to get a spring themed wanted a summer
theme so you have now seen everything

helpful for you all to watch and also
enjoyable I know I love
watching these types of videos if you
would comment below with your own tips
and tricks on how you organize your
makeup or your jewelry or your nail
polish or whatever it is

helpful I think for everyone to read
those and gain some tips and tricks for
their own things so anyway I'll stop
