bringing you my makeup collection and
Sorge and I'm very excited it's been
quite a while since I've done one of
these I did just finish decluttering so
if you are interested in my declutter
series of me getting rid of a lot of my
makeup just because it was time and I
still have a lot definitely check that
out I'll link the entire playlist below
but without further ado let's get into
the makeup collection so this is my
current setup right now I've got two of
the Alex 5 drawers there and then I've
got one of the nine drawers back there
and then a table top and then I've got
two different acrylic things which I'll
talk about as we zoom in closer about
where I got them but definitely check
below for links so let's start on this
half first I've got a lamp that I got
from my mom from Walmart a while back
I've got my JBL flip - which is just a
speaker it comes with like a little
travel case and it's so powerful and it
was it was kind of expensive but it was
worth it because I travel with it all
the time it's fantastic then here I've
got my Muji 5 drawer which honestly you
guys I don't think it's worth the money
like I know that they're I mean they're
not that expensive but they're kind of
pricey for what it is and yes they're
well-made but unless you're buying it
just for lip products you can't really
do much else with it because they're so
thin they do sell thicker ones which I
would recommend instead of this but I'll
show you another thing that I've got
that's a little thicker that is cheaper
and I like it more
so in this I've got my five two-faced la
creme lipsticks I got most of these for
$8 on HauteLook I get most of my
high-end products on HauteLook because
it's just so much cheaper
I've got a few Wyatts at YSL products
this is what I'm wearing today the
number 29 which I really like I've got
one of the NARS audacious lipsticks and
it's in the shade Anita and it's such a
pretty nude pink color
everyone loves Ana but I like Anita even
better then I've got five MAC lipsticks
back here got two of the it cosmetics
ones that they sent me bare minerals
I've got three I love these these are
the Maybelline matte collection I love
them so much I've got three of those
back here I've got two illamasqua ones
which I think these honestly you guys
are terrible they're really dry and
oh then I've got two of my Sonia Kashuk
ones which of these are so amazing so in
this first drawer here I've got a bunch
of things I got from the Dollar Tree and
if you aren't like a subscriber of my
channel I do a lot of Dollar Tree makeup
hauls and you can find amazing things
there I found all of these NYC liquid
lip shine switch these are absolutely
gorgeous and they smell amazing and I
also found all of these L'Oreal 'la
glosses and this one in Parkers one of
my absolute favorites so nine dollars
that I spent and I got nine different
lip products it's so amazing and then
I've also got these Rimmel show-off I've
got two of the velvet ones which are
like their matte ones and then two of
the regular ones and here I've got two a
couple of my lip balm tints and then
I've got all of my lip liners and I've
got some from Mac I've got a couple it
cosmetics ones starlooks and then a
bunch of random brands like NYX and one
of my favorites is this Rimmel
exaggerate in East End snob these that
the formula is amazing but the color is
what kills me it is so perfectly pink I
think I'm gonna wear this on my wedding
day and then also if you're looking for
like a nice brown nude this Milani spice
lip liner is fantastic this is kind of a
random smattering you have lipsticks
I've got my Rimmel airy-fairy which is
amazing Revlon of one of my favorites is
pink in the afternoon which is this
really pretty just pink color I don't
even know it's like classic pink to me
I've got my wet and wild ones some elf
star looks and then just some random
brands that I've received in
subscription box services so in this
drawer I've got my Jordana modern mattes
some NYX some covergirl this is another
favorite I never talk about it on my
channel it's in delicious number 3:40
and it's a really pretty like purplish
pink color I love that
and then I recently did a whole
declutter series and I got rid of all of
my Milani lipsticks like in the regular
formula because I couldn't stand the
smell but I love the matte formula and
they don't have that same smell so this
is in matte blissful I also got rid of
all my lip butters and color whispers
except for this one which is lust for
blush which is literally the prettiest
lip thing lip anything lipstick whatever
you want to call it I
own it is my favorite by far and then
I've got like a best of May 1 trina
tarantino etc in this store I've just
got all of my like pencil type lip
products so I've got my Rimmel color
rush which a review is coming on those
tart elf some of the colour-pop lippie
stix
some of the wet and wild by Fergie matte
ones I hated those I reviewed those as
well and I hated them so I'm going to
show you the other half but then I'm
gonna move some things because I know
it's hard to see with that light but
I've got my brushes right here in a cup
my mirror that's you know one of the
flip on off type things I've got a lamp
from Ikea there I've got my books I'm
reading which I'll show you up close
because a lot of you guys have asked and
then I've got this three drawer system I
got from HauteLook which has thicker
doors and I love it so much they're all
separate pieces as well which i think is
great but you can just fit more in them
because they are deeper and then of
course I've got my twisted peppermint it
is one of my favorite smells so to show
you the brushes I'm currently using
right now and you'll see where the rest
of my brushes are but I've got a lot of
it cosmetics they just sent them to me
so I'm trying them out still I've got
some elf ones these this is the
contouring brush just a random
smattering like this is Sedona lace this
is Sigma I've got a lot of elf eye
brushes as well I do not discriminate
when it comes to brushes this is diva
beauty I love them Real Techniques I
also love so that's what I'm using right
now so this is the top drawer I keep all
of my creme shadows in here so I've got
five of the Mac Paint Pots I've got
rubenesque bear study painterly let's
skate vintage selection got a few mary
kay some color tattoos from the the
rebel bloom line i reviewed this is my
favorite hibiscus heartbreak it's this
really pretty like pink then I've got
some elf smudge pots and I keep my color
pop shadows in here as well just because
they are more cream based so I find that
I'm using them more often when they're
with these creme shadows this second
drawer is where I keep all my BB creams
tinted moisturizers CC cream type
products so I've got a lot of drugstore
my C Rimmel elf I actually did a
comparison of those two if you're
interested I really like both of them
but I think I like the NYC one the best
dr. jarred Pacifica some it cosmetics
one they now have an aluminum
which it's too dark so I might have to
mix them I've got the GA luminizing
moisture tent in the tart beyond Beebe
found it actually it's technically a
foundation but I just got it I just put
it there down here I've got my
foundation so you'll see mostly
drugstore I only have two high end which
is the Estee Lauder in the tart I don't
really like the tart one the Estee
Lauder one is fine but if you've got dry
skin I don't think it's great for dry
skin but I've got the glamoflage hard
candy new one
covergirl revlon Rimmel which is my
favorite I actually have it in this pump
container here I love it I'm probably
going to wear it on my wedding it's what
I'm wearing today if you're curious
Maybelline L'Oreal etc so that's all
I've got by way of foundation not if you
guys have asked what I'm currently
reading right now I've got a few guide
books for Paris because we are going to
Paris for a honeymoon I'm reading Water
for Elephants I'm also reading The
Happiness Project and the sweet life in
Paris Tyler checked out from the library
for me because he's read and he liked it
so I'm excited to read that before going
and this one is another library book
we're nerds we totally go to the library
all the time and then this is my Erin
Condren planner that I used constantly
I'm planning my wedding so I have a
wedding one as well but I love this
thing so in this top left drawer it's
kind of a boring chore to start with but
these are all my dirty brushes so this
is where I keep them when I know that I
have used them enough that I've been
spot cleaning them but it's time for a
deep wash and it's kind of a nice gauge
for me because if it gets crazy full I
know that okay it's time to wash your
brushes dress but a lot of these are my
favorites I love this elf ultimate
kabuki brush for bronzing up my entire
face love this Real Techniques one I've
got all kinds so and of course my Beauty
Blender needs to be cleaned as well then
I've got the dry shampoo I'm currently
using which is batiste I've pretty much
tried all the different flavors cherries
good but it's not my favorite but I'm
using it right now this I got I don't
remember where it was like two dollars I
think at Target and I love it for
holding my different hair things because
it's just easy to kind of wrangle them
because I noticed that I end up without
a proper place I end up with bobby pins
and things everywhere and if you are
wondering about
yes it is men's deodorant it's Old Spice
wolf thorn it is amazing don't knock it
till you've tried it it smells so so
good oh my gosh and it works better than
anything I've ever tried then this is
the AVA NYC maintainer leaving cream
that I've been using contacts I've got
some eyelashes here that I bought from
Haute look for really cheap and the duo
glue but you guys know me I used to when
I did theater all the time and show
choir as well back in the day I used to
wear lashes all the time and I'm just
honestly tired of it so I haven't worn
them in years but with my wedding coming
up and I'm doing my own makeup I figured
I would buy a few pair and maybe try
them out so we will see and then I just
keep whatever hairspray I'm using right
now I'm using this organics argan oil
one which is okay
it's alright so this is my palette
drawer every single palette I own fits
in here so starting over here this is oh
I love this one this is the hard candy
Neff natural eyes and I got this and
realized after I bought it was only like
eight bucks that it's totally a dupe for
the Too Faced one and so I have a whole
dupe video for those eight dollars
versus thirty-six dollars it's like
unbelievable but these I think these
shadows are amazing oh my gosh I love it
I got a star look out there two of my
shady lady from the balm house these are
great because they're thin but they're
so they're easy to travel with but they
have nine really big shadows I think
these are amazing and no one talks about
them love them so then I've got two of
my two-faced ones I've got the natural
eyes but I also have a la mode which so
pretty I don't use this one as often but
I do like it
it's got my wet and wild comfort zone
Ida cluttered a lot of my wet and wild
palettes as well back in the day a bare
minerals a Coastal Scents one got like a
seal of one I got on HauteLook for
really cheap this is the Marc Jacobs
Lolita palette and it's so beautiful but
honestly you guys it it's not worth the
money it's they're nice but like this
shadow gets glitter everywhere see
that's already one out of the seven that
you can't really wear I just don't think
it's worth the money I love it and I'll
use it but I think you can get just as
good shadows spending way less so over
here is like my the bulk of my
palates so this is that it Cosmetics
naturally pretty which in that hall
where I showed everything that a
cosmetic sent me I completely forgot
because this was in my everyday makeup
drawer completely forgot that they had
sent this to me so I didn't show it but
it is nice one of my favorites the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette just has
gorgeous I love this champagne truffle
shade I've got my lorac Pro palette I
hate how dirty these get drives me crazy
if you notice I keep my makeup very
clean for the most part so it makes me
crazy I have my naked one and naked two
naked to is my favorite out of the two
because it's got more cooler tones I
just think it's beautiful and then two
new editions
I've got the two L'Oreal palettes now
L'Oreal the second palette I don't like
as much but this first one I literally
can't stop using it I used it today for
my eyeshadow look you saw at the
beginning of the video I love this
palette so much it's unbelievable again
I have a review and demo of me applying
this look on my channel and then I've
got my Mac palette here with honestly
most of these are elf shades and that's
just the honest use most of these are
elf I have some Mac shadows a few of
these are Mac but I have a lot of
singles which you'll see is so in this
third drawer down it's the first of the
deeper ones and I've got this container
I got from Walmart for like 6 bucks it's
kind of warped because it's really cheap
plastic but it works really well for
foundations or anything but I'm using it
for brushes in this one so these are all
clean brushes so this is where I keep
them once they've had their little bath
so I've got synthetic type brushes that
are meant to be used with like cream or
liquid products here here I've got
powder face brushes and then over here
I've got all of my eye or detail brushes
so and then I've got like my Beauty
Blender and things like that so that's
kind of how I organize them I have a few
other like brush things there and then
back in the back I just got some wipes
Pacifica sent my Ipsy bags that I
haven't repurposed yet and then just
some clean washcloths to use to kind of
protect my vanity up here when I'm you
so this is kind of my planner drawer so
you'll see I've got a lot of like washi
tape and just decorative tape here cute
things that you guys have sent me like
these little page flags I've got an Erin
Condren
filled with different markers
highlighters pencils pens things like
that I like that they're all wrangled in
a bag then I've got some of my like
little holders for my planner stickers
what else another really cool thing of
paper tape you guys sent some masking
tape this actually says my future name
Jessica Braun but I had it made because
I knew I wanted to use it in the future
and so I was like well in a few months I
won't have the name Murphy anymore so I
didn't want to have it made so I've got
it and right now it's holding my wedding
planner in it but I know I probably
shouldn't use it's probably like bad
luck but it's just come on I'm too
excited
um anyway so I've just got all kinds of
different things back here lots of
stickers you guys have sent some
envelopes I love these two subscriber
made Tyler and me because we are total
Disney nerds they made these little
stickers I love them anyway just all
kinds of different things back there
that I go to anytime I'm looking for
stickers for decorations or mailing
things whatever this is a really boring
drawer this is my nail care drawer but
you'll see my polishes in a bit but
they're not in here obviously so I've
got this is actually just a lid to a
star box at holding my hand sanitizers
I'm also a teacher and so these come in
handy I fly through hand sanitizer it's
crazy I keep one in my car one on my
teacher desk one here in my purse like
just everywhere so these are great they
come in handy I also really like the
target ones Crisp apple smells amazing
and then I've just got my nail polish
remover and some of the precision q-tips
which are awesome for cleaning up on the
sides of your nails then I've got all
these Revlon base coats that a
subscriber sent me because they're being
discontinued and they're my favorite
then I've just got like samples of
things and these Essie nail wrap
stickers that I found at the Dollar Tree
um what else
Oh over here I've just got all my
different hand creams so like some figs
and Rouge some vanilla bean Noel some
cuticle oil this is a foot sow from jr.
Watkins which just feels amazing if
you're I'm a runner and I use this after
we've run a really long
distance run I love putting this on my
feet it feels so amazing for tired feet
cuticle remover things some tools this
is my favorite nail file it's an OPI
crystal one and it likes stop my nails
from peeling finely so I was very
thankful for that
dotting tools just all kinds of stuff in
here if you've been watching my channel
for a while this will look familiar to
you because this is my everyday makeup
drawer and it's basically a series I do
wear every month I show what I have in
this drawer because I switch out like
things I'm trying out or maybe
rediscovered things from my collection I
put in here and it's just kind of where
I reach every morning to get ready so
it's got a lot of my favorites but it
also has a lot of new things I'm trying
out as well so start with the boring
stuff I've got some wipes and some
alcohol to spot clean my brushes as I go
just some lip balms I'm trying to use up
this soft lips one this reeva one is
amazing I found at the Dollar Tree a
rose south and then I've got just all
kinds of things my essence gel liner in
Midnight in Paris I love my everyday
minerals multitasking concealer i buy on
i buy all my everyday minerals things
from Vitacost calm and I love them I'm
wearing this today under my eyes and I'm
also wearing the everyday minerals blush
on my cheeks today this is a cosmetics
bye bye redness I'm trying out some more
one of my favorite blushes the hard
candy ombre blush and punch is amazing
in a cosmetics trio I'm trying I just
got this Becca thing in the mail it was
on HauteLook too by the way this was
crazy cheap on HauteLook
I could not believe it so I'm trying
that foundation out it's the radiant
skin satin finish foundation got a lot
of eyeliners like an NYC one the new elf
lock-on gel liner this elf
brow pencil i just got they just sent me
an eye i'm wearing it on my eyes today
and it is amazing just all kinds of
things i have one of my color pop
shadows i love in i heart this haha then
I've got some mascaras like this last
discovery one is amazing for your lower
lash line and I'm comparing it to this
it cosmetics tightline one so I'm trying
to see if they're pretty similar or not
this I just got it's the Stila stay all
day liquid lipstick in patina that
everyone
talks about and just some other
lipglosses a two-faced one I got this
Milani shadow stick from the Dollar Tree
as well so that's what's in here right
now so this is one of my favourite
drawers this is my blush and highlight
drawer so if you notice I really other
than like these color pop ones I don't
own a lot of any one brand because
obviously this is a job of mine this
YouTube it's one of my jobs and I I want
to try everything that's out there so
when I'm decluttering I don't want to
keep things just for the sake of having
a big collection of one brand I want to
try tons of different things out there
so you'll notice I have like one of each
thing so I've got like terena Tarantino
a bunch of drugstore I've got like
covergirl elf this is the everyday
minerals blush I'm wearing right now
it's in the shade Primrose it's like a
loose powder blush and I've never been
into these but this is so beautiful and
it stays on all day and it's better for
your skin too Milani wet and wild by
Fergie some of the balm blushes down boy
and hot mama and some what is this model
Co I got from like a subscription box
two of the Mac ones I've got Dame and
full of joy and full of Joy's one of my
absolute favorites I used to have a lot
of Tarte ones but I got rid of all but
this one and it's in exposed which is
gorgeous for everyday
L'Oreal it cosmetics this is one of
their ombre ones I don't like this as
much as I like the hard candy one and
hard candy is way cheaper a Kevin a Kwan
one I got from HauteLook and then these
this is kind of my thing by the way all
these containers I know you guys are
gonna ask they're all from either the
Dollar Tree or container store these are
from the Dollar Tree and then the
thicker ones are from Container Store
but anytime I find these at the Dollar
Tree I buy all that they have because
they never have many and they're just as
good they're just not as thick but
they're still really sturdy so this is
my cream blush area so I've got all
these color pop ones this is trickery
which is a beautiful light peach this is
pre nuts which I love then I've got some
Sela convertible colors which are okay I
love this NYX cream blush and boville
cheek and I've got some of these Tarte
cheek stains and fearless and blushing
bride and a master glazed one and then
just keep my benefit box blushes here
just because they didn't fit here and
they stay put even when they're on their
own so sugar bomb is beautiful for pale
skinned gals like myself I think on
anyone else it just kind of looks frosty
more like a highlight and then coralista
then I've got this elf blush palette in
light which is pretty cool I don't
retort that often to be honest but it is
really great blushes and then I have
this speaking of tart I got rid of all
but this and whoops this which the
little thing is coming out I subscribers
sent me this and it's just these five
gorgeous tart blushes I love this the
packaging is so cute
then my highlights I've got liquid
highlights here so I've got like
high-beam Stila josie maran out of all
these the high-beam works best for I
think fair skin this is actually the
Beca one and opal it was a packet to try
it and I just put it in like this Travel
one from Target in the lid then I've got
two of the Mac MSF's I've got this
Physicians Formula one which is I don't
even know what it's called I got it from
the Dollar Tree it's terrible I'm
probably going to be decluttering that
soon then one of my favorites the hard
candy Tiki one oh my gosh it is so
beautiful I wear it all the time in fact
I'm wearing it today then the wet and
wild reserved your Cabana which I have
loved enough to actually hit pan on a
highlighter which never happens I love
this then I've got this this is more
like an all-over body shimmer which I
think I'll wear on my wedding day as
well from starlooks which I love and
then my hourglass ambient lighting
palette which is beautiful but I don't
think you have to spend the money I do
think there's some amazing drugstore
options like this is more of like the
shiny bronze eryone and then this is
more like that one here on the left so
there's a lot of drugstore options out
there you don't have to buy this so this
is my bronzer and face powder drawer so
I've got bronzers and contours on this
side and then powders over here so on
this far side I've got my Aesthetica
contour kit which I did a dupe video
with this in the Anastasio one this is
totally a dupe for it and I love this
shade right here for contouring then
I've got four of my ELF contouring blush
and bronzers these are all amazing
they now have a
cream version though and you guys this
is like the only cream bronzer I've ever
used that actually stays on all day like
15 hours all day it is unbelievable
these are like three dollars got another
elf bronzer type thing my hoola bronzer
two of my favorite contouring products
the Kevin o Quan sculpting powder and
medium another treat yourself kind of
item but it is amazing and then the NYX
one in taupe which is even deeper but if
you use it right with the light hand it
looks amazing actually I'm wearing that
today and then I've got one of the only
contour powders I've ever hit pan on
this is the pixie what is it called
subtly Sun touched bronzer and it's it
works for me because I'm so fair if you
were darker than me this probably
wouldn't work but I love this I will
probably repurchase it when I'm done
with it
then I've got a Mac what is this called
taupe shape and then I've got a color
pop blush but it's more of a bronzey
shade so I put it here this is in the
shade aphrodisiac then back here I've
got more bronzers I've got my wet and
wild color icon one in ticket to Brazil
which is a much more bronzy shade than
the other one this is the it cosmetics
like ombre one I'm not a huge fan of it
and then I do like this this is the trio
their vitality face disc but I've got a
little bit of like a hard pan going on
with this like it it's really weird the
bronzer so but I love these two then
I've got some more like cream type
contour and bronzing things this is the
sculptor by part like a trial I've got
to fit me foundation stick in a darker
shade and then I've also got a Milani
one that you can use for contouring if
you wanted then I've also this is the
only foundation that's not with my
foundations because it just kind of
awkward distorts the Revlon Colorstay
whipped which you guys know I love I
wear 150 buff and then my Pilate oh rice
paper and then here and this is also
from the Dollar Tree these containers by
the way these are on my loose powder so
I've got like an elf HD one what else do
I have the it cosmetics bye bye pores
and then two of my everyday minerals
ones I like which one's the oh the
finishing dust I love to use to set my
under eye as well it's really nice and
brightening then I've got my favorite
translucent powder the NYC smooth skin
and then an elf mineral foundation as
well then here I've got a Mack MSF laura
geller one which I think this breaks me
out got the it cosmetics celebration
foundation two of the Rimmel stay matte
and I've also got their just said this
is by the way these are stored in the
lid I need to get one more container for
them this is the tone correcting powder
by elf which you kind of swirl together
and it's kind of brightening it's nice
it's really cheap - okay you guys brace
yourself for this one this is my
overflow drawer and not overflow that's
not really the right word for it this is
just where I keep things that either
companies have sent me and I just
haven't used yet like some of the elf
ones that I might not even open because
like you know I've opened one of them
that was more of a shade I would like
but like this I know I wouldn't wear so
I might pass on to a sister or use in a
giveaway things like that so that's
where these go or they're just things
that I haven't tried some of these are
giveaway items for a giveaway coming up
just all kinds of different things I
also have some things in here that I
have bought I mean a lot of this stuff
is stuff I have bought that I'm wanting
to use soon but I'm not out like this is
a dry shampoo I bought on HauteLook when
they had macadamia for cheap on there
and I'm so using the dry shampoo I
showed you earlier so this will be just
kind of next in line or like some of my
ELF skincare that I've used but I'm
trying something else out and I'm going
to go back to it so some of this isn't
just brand new it's just other stuff
that I have so that's what's it going on
in here it there's a lot this is my
candle drawer and I just opened it and
it wafted a lovely smell so I've just
got a bunch of candles I got from you
guys a lot of you guys sent me some
vanilla bean Noel candles and things
like that I have some plugins some extra
plugins I got I always go crazy when
they're sales not crazy but I like to
you know well save money so that's when
I'll buy and stock up on like a couple
of new plug-in type things because those
things get worn out then here I've got
tarts for my tart warmer which is there
because I'm not using it currently but
you're in the winter time I like to melt
tarts so I love those I've got some ones
from Walmart as well the Better Homes
and Gardens which are amazing I actually
use them in my classroom as well
and then I just got like small candles
back here um that's pretty much what's
in here so at the top of my nine drawer
up here this is where I keep my nail
polish and this is just a three-tiered
thing you can get these all over the
place
I've seen them at t.j.maxx I've also
seen them online I got mine at the
Container Store but it I think it was
marketed as like a spice rack but this
is nice for me because I like I've
mentioned I declutter a lot and I don't
like to hold on to nail polish for too
long either
especially if I'm not using it so I
never have more nail polish than what
will fit in here and so if I buy one I
have to get rid of one that way it's
never too never too much I mean this is
already too much anyway so I've got some
butter LONDON ones I got Illamasqua some
China Glaze like really fun colors for
like summer for your toes
some Orly I love the Orly formula some
of the selling it's an extreme where
Essie back here this is one that I love
I just got called find me and Oasis the
one I'm wearing right now on my nails is
the miracle gel by Sally Hansen and it's
in crumbly creme which I love any of
these formulas of the salon manicure got
some of the wet and wild megalast as
well just all kinds again I don't
discriminate I've got a bunch from
subscription boxes and just all kinds of
things so this one might be a little
difficult to see but it's higher up than
everything else has been so these are
container store containers I love these
smaller ones and then these are Dollar
Tree ones so this is kind of a random
drawer this is where I keep all of my
pencil liners so I've got like the NYX
wonder pencil just all kinds some Stila
some Oprah Rimmel scandaleyes
I love that formula some of the Jordana
twelve-hour made to last ones which are
unbelievable and they're so cheap just
all comes i like the star loved ones as
well then this is where I keep all of my
liquid liners and my gel liners which I
wear gel or cream liner every single day
but I've got like Physicians Formula
star look some of these ones I found at
the Dollar Tree which are the Milani
ones these like stain though so I might
be getting rid of these because they
literally stained my hand I'm like oh my
gosh I don't want that stain
on my eyes with all kinds of things like
that
Oh another one I'm trying out is this
NYC liquid liner here I've got my like
extra lip balm e-type product so like my
favorite this is my favorite night balm
I wear this day and night it is
unbelievable you can find it at Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works some Mary Kay things my
favorite lip balm like for the daytime I
don't like as much as the night one but
it's okay
and then like a lip scrub I got in the
meaty box things like that these are my
mascaras this one I got in an influencer
box for free I could not believe that
the full-size YSL so I'm going to be
trying that out soon l'oreal voluminous
essence i heart extreme and m1 that I
can't stand I'm probably ready to throw
that away then this is a perversion when
I haven't tried yet and these are all my
eyebrow products so like I've got some
uh Nastasia ones I've got an it
cosmetics one a NYX one but it's not
quite in my shade but it's good it
really is good an ICO brow gel some more
of the elf ones but in different shades
some chela brow gel and just all kinds
of different things so this drawer has
my concealers and also some primers and
eyeshadows it's kind of a weird mix of
things but they fit really well together
so that's fine
so this container I got at I think
Walmart for like two or three dollars I
want to go back and get a few more
because they are so great for holding
like single eyeshadows just small things
they'd be great for holding lip balms I
think too so I've got some single Mac
shadows back here but they're kind of
mixed in with some NYX wands and some be
a bombshell ones but I love these Mac
shadows that I probably do need to do
pop them because I'm not using them as
much when they're not in a pallet to be
honest I've got a Kevin a Quan one in
stone that I got on HauteLook and it's
the perfect crease color for me just for
an everyday really light mixing color
then I've just got a oh my gosh so many
random ones I Milani one Stila kitten an
old urban decay one but it's in half
baked which is my favorite shade so when
I travel so that I don't have to bring a
whole Naked palette to bring half baked
I can just bring this one so I love that
just all kinds I've got some of my
infallible
shadows here this glitter from
wet-and-wild is amazing a subscriber
sent me then up here I've got some of my
potted concealer so I got like Yves
pearl which is such a nice treatment
concealer it just feels nice and if you
want to see the inside it's just like a
cream and I don't usually go for once in
pots but I love this stuff Mary from a
love tart is the one that got me hooked
on this she loves it and I love her this
is the erase paste from benefit I've got
some like powdery ones here like the elf
one bare minerals etc then these are all
my other concealers so I've got a really
solid mix of high end and drugstore
because you can find some amazing
drugstore concealer so I've got like
Maybelline Dream Lumi NYX HD which in my
opinion I just did a dupe video with
that in the NARS one I think the next
one is just as good and you can see in
that video I'm wearing one on one I am
one on the other and in my opinion you
can't tell the difference I love this
stuff some Maybelline the glamoflage
Rimmel if cosmetics this Tarte one I
don't think I like this one either
it's too thick Mac's a long wear wet and
wild cover all this is a becca one that
is terrible I couldn't believe how bad
this is and then this is the elf like
concealer palette and actually to be
honest with you guys you guys know I
love elf but I'll also tell you when
they're terrible I thought this would be
terrible it was unbelievably creamy I'll
show you it is so creamy and it doesn't
really move throughout the day it is so
I was so surprised back here I've got
some primers so I've got like two of the
two-faced ones which lemon drop is a
little bit more yellow based I don't
notice that it really corrects like the
color that much but I've also got some
like cream shadow type primers like
these bare minerals ones this Revlon one
which I love
some wet and wild elf some glitters back
here from star lips etc then this is
these are all of my like quads duo's and
trios I only have a few because I really
did get rid of a lot so I've got this
becca one that I love I've got a train a
Tarantino duo
this pixie one oh my gosh this is the
most beautiful it's in shades of taupe
and when I first got this recently I
literally wore it every day for like a
month it is so
beautiful for just a natural look then
I've got this Maybelline mocha motion
quad and it is an amazing drugstore quad
oh my gosh and then I've got a few
extras here that I got from the Dollar
Tree la colors and this was the
Physicians Formula one this is just
where I kind of keep my skincare in a
way so I've got my setting sprays over
here Urban Decay L'Oreal a little mac
fix+ and the NYX matte finish and then
I've got primers here so I've got ELF
Maybelline wet and wild it cosmetics one
this is one I buy from Paula's Choice
it's kind of a tinted moisturizer but it
works as a primer as well as SPF of 30
and it doesn't make you really it is so
nice oh my gosh I love it and then I've
got some of my skin care I'm using right
now so I'm using the elf nourishing
night cream got the seer of a p.m.
facial moisturizing lotion oh my gosh
this angelou Naturals serum is amazing
these I buy from Vitacost and Andalou
naturals luminous eyes serum these are
two of my favorites they transformed my
skin and they are so cheap on that site
and then just some random other things
so this drawer is my lip gloss your so
aside from the ones that were in my Muji
drawer this is the rest of them so I'm
just using some of these Dollar Tree
containers and then one of those small
ones I got from Walmart as well so I
don't really have them organized in any
fashion I used to do it by like color
but honestly I don't have that many
where I mean I can see everything so I
kind of have an idea of what I want so I
just like being able to see it all I'm
not as concerned with anything else to
be honest so I've got just random brands
some Estee Lauder some Too Faced
Illamasqua I've got some Tarina
Tarrantino some echo Bella like natural
lip glosses some of the Milani ones
these are really nice
kaylynn cielo some of my NYX butter
glosses these are like where all my
small things go so I've got like some
small bucks and ones I got you a all
kinds of things this is the starlooks
one in the shade guilty-pleasure and it
is the most beautiful lip gloss I've
ever worn and I keep wanting to buy it
and the full-size on their site but it's
like always sold out no surprise it is
absolutely beautiful these are actually
my favorite
lipglosses right now so I've got my
buxom White Russian got my bellapierre
vanilla pink NYX beige this flower
beauty one and then the NARS Turkish
Delight I love all of those and then
back there I just have some like squeezy
tube ones some lip paints and this
melted one that I love the fifth drawer
down actually just has all of my
thank-you cards like blank ones that I
write and then a bunch of letters that
you guys have written me that I need to
respond to so that's kind of where I
keep all of those I like having them so
I can see them all I just love that and
Target dollar section has the best
thank-you cards ever yours are going to
laugh at me so this is where I keep all
of my tees that I buy I've got a lot of
the yogi tea my tazos entity that I love
and the organic 90 night honestly we ran
out of room in the kitchen so this is
where they are now because I just bought
tons at a time because I love tea and
I'd rather just pay for the shipping
once cuz it's way cheaper online but I
also keep my empties here I need to find
a better home but I've got like handle
and some other things I've used up that
I'm kind of saving up for an empties
video it's ridiculous I know but that's
what's in that drawer
this drawer just has some hair products
that I'm using right now so I've got
like a texturizing spray this is when I
wear my hair naturally curly just all
kinds of things like that I've got some
brushes back there a tangle teezer type
thing and then rubbing alcohol I use to
spot clean my brushes as well kind of a
boring drawer this mess of a drawer is
all of my heat tools oh my gosh I know
it doesn't look organized because it's
not but I do have like the two things I
use on top so that that way at least
that's easy grab but honestly you guys I
don't know of a better way to store
these so that's just what's going on
right now I need to research and maybe
figure out a better way but for now you
know it is what it is this drawer just
has like kind of boring stuff like well
this is the box that Tyler used to
propose to me in that had this ring in
it oops so I got as special but I've got
just cords to charge like my speakers my
iPad my laptop etc in there then I've
got like sunglasses and glasses case and
then this one of my students gave me it
came with a Mickey mug and this is a mug
warmer and it's Mickey and it glows so I
keep
because when I'm taking my time getting
ready I'll plug this in and keep my
coffee warm on it I think that is the
coolest thing ever so oh and then this
is just something that you can use to
like I usable I'm getting ready I'll put
my iPad in here and it'll hold it up if
you don't have like a case on it that
holds it up itself or you can use it for
cookbooks and things like that so I love
that thing so hopefully you enjoy taking
a peek into how I organize everything
sometimes I go bonkers because I will
watch another person's collection and
I'm like oh my gosh they have never
gotten rid of anything ever and I think
wow like it is such an amazing feeling
to declutter and I still have way too
much makeup but I also know that for me
this is one of my jobs so if I don't
declutter at least once maybe twice a
year then I know that my collection will
totally get out of hand it'll be
overwhelming more than it already is and
I'm it's just not healthy you know what
I mean and on top of that makeup does go
bad so there's only so long I can keep
everything but that's just kind of me in
the way that I operate I have to
declutter for my own sanity but I know
some people you know they don't feel
overwhelmed by a lot and more power to
you because I can do it I can barely do
this much but hopefully this was
enjoyable for you if you're interested
