going to talk to you guys about how and
why I decluttered my makeup if you
follow me on Instagram you probably
recently saw well I guess now it was a
couple weeks ago that I sold a ton of
makeup and I've been doing that kind of
recently where I'll sell things that I
purchased with my own money not things
that were sent to me from companies but
things that I purchased my own money
that I maybe swatched once for a video
maybe twice and that I wasn't using
anymore and that I felt like passing on
but I felt like someone else could love
it just as well so those things were
sold but probably four times that amount
was given away and donated so I have
really gotten rid of a lot and I've been
inspired by a lot of people here on
YouTube but I've also been inspired by
the book I've been reading which is the
life-changing magic of tidying up and
it's by Marie Kondo and she's got this
method called the konmari method kind of
a an inversion of her name and it really
has changed my outlook on a lot and I
will link my video of me decluttering
all my clothes and it really is an
emotional experience and if you've never
gone through you're probably like why is
it that emotional it's done it's closed
it's just things and I know that it's
just things but I do believe that these
things can really cloud not only our
mind but our lives and way more ways
than I think we even realize and I just
feel like that was happening to me that
you know I I just recently got married
so that stress was over but I'm now
teaching a different grade than I was
last year and just all these different
things and moving in with my husband all
those things on top of just having so
much stuff I was like gosh this stuff is
what I made control of I am in control
of that and I let myself have so much
and while I know that's a blessing I
also know that it's in weird ways to
curse because it really does weigh down
on you so I I'm not going to show you me
going through my makeup but I am going
to show you guys pictures of my process
of you know where I started where I
ended up what I kept what I
but I wanted to talk you through why and
kind of my bad habits that maybe will
help you if you're going through your
makeup so let's go ahead and get into it
so I started with my lip products and as
you can see here I have so many I didn't
even count them I was too scared I
couldn't count them so many and I had to
make sure that I got them out of my car
my purse my nightstand my bathroom
drawer out of here obviously I have them
everywhere so I made sure every single
lip balm lip gloss lipstick lip liner
were all in one pile now I could have
further separated it into lipsticks and
lip glosses but I was just in a mood
where I was like let's go so I just
started from the middle picked one up
and basically what I asked myself
which you'll hear in the other video is
wealth with my clothes was first of all
would I buy this again like if all of my
stuff suddenly went missing would I want
to buy these again and that was kind of
my first thing I thought when I was
looking at a lipstick and it was so
amazingly easy for me to pick out and
just kind of shop again and I know
people say shop my stash but I really
was I was going through a thing I would
absolutely buy this again if I lost it
or if I ran out I would buy it again so
I picked those things out and I had as
you can see way less than I expected
it's still way more than I need but I
have to take into account that you know
this is one of my jobs and I love makeup
and I love YouTube my job is to review
makeup so I need to still have a good
base but there were products that I had
never ever ever touched brand new
absolutely brand new in there tons of
them probably half and that made me sick
because I'd like to see I don't even
know like I can't appreciate I'm about
to film a subscription box unboxing
video as well I can't even enjoy the new
stuff in there because I have so much
else cluttering my mind and my makeup
drawers so I just don't even see and
know what I have so that was kind of my
main question the one thing I had to
keep myself in check with was not
worrying about how much I am
I have spent on it or how much a product
is worth so like some things you know I
would look at a matte lipstick and call
me and like this was 14 how much Rebecca
looks like 14 or 15 dollars however much
it is and I'm like aha man and it's Mac
I just want to grow my Mac clutch but I
had to ask me something like but why
keep it if it's just sitting there and
there are some MAC lipsticks I had like
a viva glam Nikki one that was this
bright coral that I've never I think i
swatched once or twice I've never really
worn because it doesn't make sense with
my skin tone and with what I like so
there were certain things in there I'm
like why do I have this I just bought it
because it was you know someone had
mentioned it once and then I never used
it but I kept it because I wanted to be
my collection but there's nothing better
than opening your drawer like I have one
drawer with all of my lip products and
all my glosses and I probably got rid of
like 50 lip glosses and kept like maybe
15 there's not the better than opening
that drawer and looking at it and
thinking oh I love all of this stuff
like I could close my eyes and grab
anything and I know I will love it
because these are like my ride-or-die
Holy Grail all the different you know
euphemisms we use for those products
that we just love so much all of them
are those I don't have a couple like
ones that I'm like oh I wasn't sure if I
was unsure about it I thought there's a
reason that I'm not sure if I want to
keep her keep it or give it away so I
would just give it away
cuz why if I'm even a little unsure then
it's not something I truly truly truly
love or need so looking at the picture
there were a lot of lip glosses that I
held on to and I could tell them myself
oh they're not that old but I really
thought about and I'm like I probably
bought that before I got my channel and
when I started my channel that was over
two years ago so this has to be that old
so there were a lot I could get rid of
for that but beyond that just ones that
I'm like I don't like bright lip glosses
because really if I'm wanting a bright
lip
I would rather wear a lipstick that I
know is going to stay put whereas a
bright lip gloss I know now that I need
to stop buying them because they run
outside of my lip line and I don't like
that especially if it's a bright purple
or a bright whatever so I'm kind of
learning more about my patterns as a
makeup buyer and I'm learning that there
are certain things I really should avoid
because I might like things I'm like oh
well I've watched these people on
YouTube and I love that
they like this but that doesn't mean
that it's going to look great on me and
if I know I don't like that then why
spend the money the next thing I went
through are my eye products and you can
see here I have got a lot now with this
I did my cream shadows my pallets my
singles my eyeliners my mascaras my
primers my eye primers that is a lot of
stuff and this one was a lot easier than
I thought because as I looked at him
like oh my gosh there's so many pouts
that I love so many of them and as I
started going through I'm looking at my
pictures on my phone right now as I
started going through it I realized wow
I have way more than what I need and
I've got like five of the same shade I
don't need that I'm never going to go
through one of them let alone five so I
really did look at it and say okay I'm
just going to pick one because I think I
emotionally attached myself to these in
the weirdest way where I'm like oh but
what if I run out like what if I run out
I can go to Walmart and buy a wet and
wild single in that color for a dollar
ninety-nine or you know it's not like
it's the end of the world if I actually
run out of a product and I actually need
buy it at the store that would be
amazing I had to do that with makeup
which is awesome in a long time so I
need to get that out of my mind but
looking at it there were a lot of
products that I thought oh well a
company sent this to me and you know
I've tried it or maybe I showed in a
video so you guys could see what it
looked like but I was keeping it for
that reason but I'm like I don't really
like it or I'm not really using it or
it's just not my style then there's no
reason for me to onto it because it's
not benefiting anyone for me having it
just sitting in a drawer I realized I
had a lot of loose glitters that I never
ever use so I got rid of most of those
and I realized again that's another
thing I need to not buy because I just
don't use them I don't like them I might
look at them in a swatch and think wow
that's beautiful
but I know that in the day-to-day it's
not something I ever reach for another
tip I'm learning about myself is that if
I were to go and look at a palette or a
quad and think about buying it what I
want to start asking myself is if I just
had this quad to get ready with could I
use it because I've noticed a pattern
that when I'm getting ready in the
morning I only use palettes that I can
get a complete look out of I very rarely
will pick one up and use
it and then get another to fill in the
gaps like if I need a matte light brown
and it's not in the PAL then I very
rarely will go to another I just won't
use that pout I'll just use a different
palette all together so I need to be
better about since I know that about
myself I need to make sure I'm buying
pallets that have what I would need for
a complete look and that's just me a lot
of people like having all of it out by
just don't so as you can see I got rid
of a lot on the left is what I am
keeping and on the rise what I'm getting
rid of which is the case for all these
pictures and I like I said I was
surprised at how much I was able to get
rid of and there were a lot of high-end
mascaras I was holding on to someone oh
but they're high-end and they're like
they're kind of okay they're just
flaking a little bit I'm like just get
just get rid of them but even so I was
even able to get rid of like a Mac Paint
Pot and a bunch of palettes from like
the bowl um and health and just ones
that I knew I was never ever going to
use the next thing I went through were
my face products so that would be
concealers and foundations powders
things like that not my blush bronzer
and stuff yet and as you can see I had a
lot um one thing I realized that
accumulated a lot of or face powders and
primers and I don't even use primers
every day and I realized like why do I
have so many primers so I was able to
get rid of a lot that I had tried and I
felt like maybe this one's breaking me
out or maybe I tried once that I
realized I don't like the way it makes
my skin look with foundation on top of
it so I was able to get rid of a pretty
good chunk but I did keep some because
they're drugstore primers that I'm
planning to do a video on so for that I
actually had a purpose for but I have a
feeling one side compared them all I'll
probably get rid of most of them and
just keep the maybe two that I really
really like so that was one that I
wasn't able to pair down as much as I
like because of what I have planned for
it but beyond that the face powders I
had a pretty good amount of them I got
rid of a lot and just kept three because
I'm like first of all I don't I only
need one face powder but I also don't
use them everyday so they were just
really going bad quickly for just
because I wasn't using them so I was
really excited to get rid of all but
three of them and they're three that I
could again with my eyes closed reach in
and grab any of them and they work
wonderfully so I was really
about pairing that down that much
concealers I got rid of any that I felt
were old I had a lot of concealers in
there that I'd had for a while and I'm
sure they went bad months ago and I just
hadn't thought about it because time
just passes in my collections just my
collection so I don't really think too
often about how long I've had certain
things but this really made me take a
minute and think about that so in the
end I probably cut that collection down
a little less than half for what I kept
there on the left and there were some
things that I know I would buy again
like I love my Revlon Colorstay width I
would buy that again I have I love my
Rimmel foundation but there are some
things that I kept because I like them
but once I use them up I think they'll
just be out of my collection and I
probably wouldn't buy again now the
hardest one was my blushes bronzers
highlighters I just love them and I
think a lot of us do now my blush
collection is large and I love blush and
I still kept a pretty good amount but I
realized there were just some colors I
had that we're so dark or so bright
cinnamon red or so bright orange that
I've never used them for a reason when
I'm getting ready in the morning whether
I've got a long time to get ready or a
short time I'm still never reaching for
them and I keep them something oh but I
don't have one like this so I better
keep it but I'm like I don't have one
like this because I never want ones like
this so I don't know why I bought it in
the first place so I got rid of a lot of
really bright colors or really dark
colors that you know I would have to
work so hard to make work with my skin
anyway that I figure it's I've got way
too many that are amazing that I don't
even want to waste my time on the ones
that aren't really working for me as you
can see I kept up still a pretty good
amount on the left what I'm keeping and
I had already put it in little
organizers put in my drawer and on the
right is what I got rid of I realized
one bad habit I
I've accumulated a lot of blush palettes
and I just don't use them because in the
morning I like going through my separate
little blushes and picking out which one
I'm going to use that day whereas I
don't what I don't know there's
something I just don't really use blush
palette so for whatever reason I had
accumulated a lot so I got rid of a
pretty good amount of those which was a
good feeling because again they're just
sitting there my main thing that I took
away from this were just my bad habits
in makeup buying and I love makeup and
that's ever going to change and I never
you know I don't think I'll ever be down
to the way I used to be where I would
just have one makeup bag and it was all
my stuff but I almost envy people like
that because I have so much that it can
be so overwhelming but I also love it so
it's like playtime so for me I'm kind of
bridging the gap between that where I
don't want to have so much like I have
that I don't know what to do but I also
don't want to have so little for a job
like I have I need to have a point of
reference and I need to be able to
compare things so I'm kind of learning
myself and this process as I go but I do
think this is something that now that
I've done such a large overhaul once and
actually really this is twice as long as
I just keep up with it I think I'm going
to be okay you know I think this is
easily now that I've kind of seen the
error of my ways if you will I think
it'll be easier for me to keep up with
this and I just I love like I said
opening my drawers and seeing all my
favorites staring back at me waiting to
be picked and I could pick any of them
and it would just be glorious so I am so
excited to kind of start this new
journey where I'm going to be a lot
pickier about what I keep and being
honest with myself about why I'm buying
something you know am i buying it just
because someone said they liked it but I
know that it's a bright red cheek bright
red blush and I'll never like it or am i
buying it because I genuinely want it or
need it or whatever or I want to review
it so those are kind of my truths I
would love to hear what your truths and
your habits are and patterns when it
comes to mega buying and things that
you're going to be working on over the
next year as we head in the fall and as
we head into
Christmas it's a season of accumulation
where we all kind of you know we get
gifts and we they're great sales so we
might buy some things what are you going
to work on I'm so curious because it
just might help me it might help some
others that are also reading the
comments I hope that you enjoyed this
