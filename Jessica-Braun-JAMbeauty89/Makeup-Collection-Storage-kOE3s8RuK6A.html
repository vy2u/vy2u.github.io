I have my updated makeup collection and
storage and you guys it is completely
different like in my collection a in the
past like four or five months has grown
by like times three I mean like crazy
and a lot of you guys too sent me stuff
I've gotten some stuff from other things
and and of course I bought some things
and it has been so much fun and this I
just had so much fun making YouTube
videos I hope you guys are enjoying them
because I have a blast doing this but
anyway um oh by the way do you guys see
those flowers I can see the flowers my
boyfriend came over late last night
and he brought me those flowers and he
said it was just because you know I'm
just like melting in a puddle like
tearing up like crazy oh it was just so
sweet he can be so romantic some fun so
I don't mean to brag but he's a pretty
awesome guy and I feel very lucky and I
like him a lot
anyway um I'm talking another news
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video maybe you learn some things some
inexpensive ways to store your makeup at
least container wise but I'm excited to
show you guys so please enjoy I keep
looking here because it's over here but
anyway have fun watching and if you do
enjoy it please subscribe and I'll see
you guys in just a second so this is my
current setup I got this
these your sets and the tabletop they're
all three separate pieces from Ikea I
think it totalled to about 200 dollars
in total and actually my boyfriend
bought them for me the chair is I don't
know where well I don't know where it's
from because it was given to me a friend
was gonna get rid of it so I took it
anyway but the drawer sets are great
they are the alux drawer sets but
instead of the 9 drawer they are the 5
drawer obviously and so I love them and
the reason I chose these instead of the
9 drawer system was because the 9 drawer
is so tall that you kind of have to have
it you know as a separate piece and that
meant that most of my collection
wouldn't be kind of at hands reach so I
really wanted everything to be literally
at my fingertips because I like to
change up what I'm using each day so
that I really do utilize all of my
collection so I really really like this
for that reason I
can reach everything that is in my
collection within a moment so let's go
ahead and dig right on in this uh mirror
I got from um well hello this mirror I
got from a garage sale so I have no idea
where it's from but um I can tell you
where these things are from can't I the
coaster I got at the Dollar Tree isn't
cute and just like it and I drink coffee
here every single morning so it's nice
to have that there to kind of protect
this little top here this is one of my
favorite storage things I got this spice
rack from the Container Store it's all
acrylic and I use it to hold my nail
polish collection and actually this is
pretty much my collection there's a few
that you'll see is in a drawer like ones
that are maybe better for another season
or I just don't use as often right now
but this is great to help kind of keep
my nail collection like kind of keep it
contained so that way I don't get too
many although I already have a lot but
most of these were sent from you guys so
anyway so I've just got most of my Essie
right here some OPI a little bit of
China Glaze some julep polishes I love
the Sally Hansen manicure line so much I
got some of those some Rimmel back there
and then just some random brands some
more Sally Hansen wet-and-wild Orly etc
so really really love that for storing
those the lamp is from Walmart my mom
got for me for Christmas last year and
it's cute got a little sparkles and it's
just small I love it and I love that
it's kind of like a taupe silvery color
my frame here is from Kohl's and it's a
Malden frame I love those and I love
what it says and the picture is actually
of Tyler my boyfriend and I we were in
Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan which is
absolutely stunning if you've never been
there my goodness plan a trip it is
beautiful
so then this brush holder another new
addition to my collection
it was $12.99 at Marshall's or TJ Maxx
one of the two they're basically the
same so but I have it sorted it's six
little compartments and I have it sorted
by type so I have like Foundation and
cream product type brushes some from
Sigma Real Techniques and then I have
some blush and bronzer brushes elf my
favorite this elf complexion brush is my
favorite blush brush and
a bareMinerals one I like to use for
bronzer a lot and then I have powder
brushes here real technique Sonia Kashuk
elf and then this little guy belongs
over here actually I'll just stick it
get down in there it's a real technique
one that I love and then my eye brushes
I just having two separate ones most
likely to use least likely to use I use
them all but these are the ones I am
looking for the most so in one worth
mentioning these by the way most of
these are dirty just deal with it the
real techniques what is it called the
duo fiber eye brush I absolutely love
this brush for the crease fantastic my
friend Amber's tell me that so this is
just an awesome for $12.99 I mean come
on
so you need to go get it because it's
awesome if you have that many brushes
this mirror I think it's Conair it's
perfect it lights up there's now in the
back I love it my candle this is one of
my favorite scents right now it's sugar
blossom from Target and then my perfumes
are over here this mirrored piece it's
an octagon shape but they also had like
heart and star and circle shapes at
Hobby Lobby for 399 but I'm sure you can
find it at Michael's Joey I mean any
craft store this little container back
here is just from a craft store and it's
got a little ribbon on it but I just
hold my lip butters in it mostly because
I grab for these more than anything and
it's literally right near my door so I
can literally grab it while I'm running
out the door and then I have my three
perfumes of Viva La Juicy misty or which
is my ultimate favorite and then a
flower bomb by Viktor and Rolf I love
those and I pretty much wear those at
different times of years so so that's
everything that's on the top of my
vanity we have a pug that wants to greet
us hi buddy bud ice and my buddy boy
what are you doing is anyone here who's
here
say all the YouTube viewers are here you
know cutie okay so back to business so
we're going to start on the right side
in the top drawer so in it I house all
of my blushes and highlighters that I
own so I have these containers here that
are like this clear gray that are from
Dollar General I have two of those and
then in the middle here I have this
three compartment one that I got at the
Dollar Tree has two smaller compartments
and then a longer one for only a dollar
and these were only a dollar as well at
Dollar General
and then this container was from Target
in the dollar section - in a pack and
then this is actually just a drawer from
one of my little drawer sets I got at
Target so I'm just using that for now so
on this side here I have most of my
blushes on the side I have kind of stuck
my elf blush and bronzer things my Sonia
Kashuk blush and bronzer and then just
another Physicians Formula one that
wouldn't fit a blush and then I've got
my Tarte blushes here I have dull face
and a small spot small size exposed
charisma and blushing bride then I have
two Mac blushes I've got Dame and well
dress these two here then some MSF's
from Mac this actually is a highlight
but I just keep it with it because it
just fits well here it's in oh my gosh
soft and gentle I was blanking on the
name and then my new favorite it's
called lust and I amber my friend that
sent it to me I think told me it was
limited edition but it is absolutely
gorgeous oh my gosh wearing it today
actually then I have some Milani baked
ones let me know so and dolce pink dolce
Pink's my favorite look how beautiful it
is Physicians Formula NARS elf one and
then two from the balm that I love hot
mama and down boy I love their blushes
they're so good and when you could find
them on HauteLook they're great deals I
feel like it's just so much cheaper on
there of course when they go in there so
in this middle one I have a lot of cream
blushes I've got all my little Dream
bouncy blushes in here from Maybelline I
have a NYX one and boho chic that I love
um and then some like this is an elf
facial whip I have benefit Watts up
little trial thing and then I have
benefit Benetint which I actually do
like it's a little trial size then up
here I have another cream one from
Revlon and then a NYX one intensed and
then a Pilate oh one that I love it's
called blushing and I'm going to be
doing a review on these Palladio
products pretty soon I love that blush
and then for my highlighters I've got
one from musicians formula philosophy a
pixie one and Oliver radiance it's it's
absolutely beautiful
no I think it's called Oliver magic and
the shade is brightening radiance
gorgeous then - from wet and wild fur
you want and then the reserve your
Cabana one that I love
then back here I just have some Pilate
of products the rice powder in the rice
paper
I wanted them closer to me so I would
use them to try them out and then some
little Knicks glitters and then back
here I have my benefit fine one one and
then I have some liquid products some to
liquid blushes from Sonia Kashuk
and then this one I love it's in the
shade poppy it's so pretty and then this
I actually cut in a birch box one year
estilo one-step bronze it's actually
really nice I just don't reach for it
very often so that is what is in this
very first drawer on to the second
drawer in this one I keep a lot of them
remove my leg out of the way and this
one I keep a lot of eye products as well
as some other things so umm let's see
where to begin in this I've got this
little three acrylic compartment thing
from a store Naomi called Meyer it was
actually like a jewelry organizer I
think is what it was marketed as but who
cares so in it I've got all my
concealers here some hints kind of dirty
Neutrogena Rimmel some Maybelline
L'Oreal one I love the glamoflage I've
got benefit erase paste and some kind of
gorgeous and then of course my favorite
covergirl my legs love that one then
over here in the second one I've got eye
primers for the most part and then also
some concealer setting powders what's
that one doing in there that one belongs
over here so like an elf one and a Tarte
one just setting powders and then I
primers I've got one for mark this new
one I'm trying out from wet n wild by
Fergie some elf and then a Urban Decay
one that I think is on its last leg so
that's kind of what's in there and then
here I've got an eye makeup remover pen
but then I've got face primers so I've
got some Smashbox origins vytas inge
Sephora bare minerals things like that
and then back here I've just got like
random samples that I'm wanting to try
out a lot of them are like hand creams
or sunscreens that I'm going to be
trying soon this one I've tried a few
times I really like but yeah like a zit
zap or just kind of random things in
there that I just want closer to me so I
see them so I use them then in this
middle drawer it's one of those Dollar
Tree three compartment things that I
showed you in that other drawer I have
cream eyeliners here another one I'm
trying out right now my favorite the
L'Oreal one and then
from ELF I'm not fond of and then these
are all my pencil liners so a lot from
Jordanna I actually just recently got
these I haven't tried them the Jordana
twelve-hour made to last so far I love
it I have been trying this black one
here and I really really like it just
got lots of random so like some Smashbox
Milani Victoria's Secret even just all
kinds I mean oh I love the Rimmel
scandaleyes as well so those are all in
there and I also some liquid ones like
from Physicians Formula in BH Cosmetics
sharpener trusty old sharpener and then
just some liquid liner a green one from
Milani and then it's actually a taupe
one from Pilate oh and then over here I
have mascaras now before you freak out
these are the only two I've opened right
now and actually this had Hypnose star
is totally needs to be thrown out this
one I'm trying to use more I don't I
don't really like the way it wears on my
lashes because it like never dries I
don't know all of these are unopened so
they're either were sent to me by
someone or by a company or their sample
size and none of them are open because I
actually really am pretty good about
opening one to two mascaras at a time I
really only like having one at a time
open but because otherwise you're going
to be throwing away like ten mascaras
all at the same time you know what I
mean I can't stand that so I'm really
actually pretty darn good about that but
anyway here's another container this oh
by the way this container was from that
store name we called Meyer another
jewelry one it was like three bucks but
yeah I don't know where else it might be
sold this is another Dollar General
container and I just have setting sprays
and elf one my everybody Cal nighter and
then in here I got this spray bottle
from the Dollar Tree and it has alcohol
in it to spot clean my brushes so that
is what's in that drawer now on to the
third drawer and this is the first one
that becomes a deep drawer and in it I
have most of my lip products here as
well as some face products so these are
contained a lot of people have done this
from the dollar store these little three
and one and where it's got like cotton
balls cotton rounds etc and you just cut
off the lid and then BAM so I've got
three of those for a total of three
dollars and that awesome
and then I also scored a ton of q-tips
and stuff so
anyway so in and I have all my lipsticks
over here I've got like a maybelline
color whispers I got a lot of those some
Maybelline one some from the Vivid's
line my little urban decay revolution
sample I got in my Ipsy bag and then
some julep ones that I really like and
then over here I have a couple Mac I
actually don't have very many Mac ones
I've - but this is my favorite cream cup
right now - from Rimmel here for from
Revlon and then a bunch of Sonia Kashuk
ones and these are I don't know if I can
get it one out that's the other thing if
there are certain shape they're harder
to get out I love these lipsticks
they're beautiful and they have
beautiful packaging as well so it's
win-win some from Pilate oh here in some
Revlon Super Lustrous then I have most
of my glasses here so I also have some
balm stain some like Revlon ones and
some other things like that and then
I've got like some Smashbox glosses one
of my favorites from Pilate Oh oh my
gosh I love this one what is the color
name for this baby doll it is absolutely
gorgeous a mac lipglass and fresh air I
also love a Milani one some NYX ones
that I love and they have the cutest I
want to store them this way because they
the cutest little bow but I want to be
able to see the color - so tricky just
all kinds some from Revlon down here so
all kinds those are really great for
storage and really really inexpensive so
I love that up here in the Dollar
General container I have it's actually
sitting on top of something so it can
actually like it's a long story but just
so it all fit in this drawer properly I
have most of my like lip balms and
things like that so I got my baby lip
some sugar I have my lip liners I really
don't use some lip butters back there
CEO Bigelow Nivea and then some like
restorative type things like aqua for
blistex etc some squeezy tube loot
glosses back here just because they
wouldn't really fit in there and then
these my sea lip slider tins that are
really really cool you can sometimes
find these at the dollar store too then
over here I have in this it's a three
compartment like clear serving tray
thing from the dollar store so is only a
dollar and it was in like the like
plates and dishes section it was like a
serving tray so I got a few of those
you're going to see but in this first
part I have face powders so I have my
room

have my mac studio fix powder dream
matte and then some NYX ones in two
different shades my winter and summer

makeup bags that I use
for travelling purposes that are just
empty they're ready for me to fill up
the next time I travel that's what's in
that so into the fifth drawer and I hope
you know that I am currently sitting on
the floor right in the fifth drawer is
actually a goodie bag it's like a
treasure trove this is where I put all
the products that I haven't opened yet
that I'm going to try you know what I
mean so back here I have extras of baby
wipes because I use those you know if
you just need to wipe your hands off or

some things from Pilate oh that they
sent me I'm going to be reviewing for
you soon by vitamin E cream the next oil
I'm going to be trying that deodorant I
was telling you about I'm excited to
give it a shot and just other things
that I just haven't utilized yet that
I'm really excited about actually under
this stuff here this subscriber of mine
sent me all of these like samples that
she has gotten from like hotels because
she was a flighted sent I thought that
was the coolest thing so a lot of these
under here are things she sent me that
I'm excited to travel with and try out
so that's kind of what's in there and
then this actually hidden underneath a
lot of this or some giveaway things but
I'm not going to show you but this thing
that's holding this is from Ikea they're
actually um for like I think for like
actual like dresser drawers like for
clothes I'm not sure but I've got my
masks here that I could be trying and
other things I've gotten in empty bags
or things that I haven't run out of the
one I'm using like tissues you know and
then there's some stuff I'm not going to
dig too deep because stuff underneath
here are going to be for a future
giveaway soon but then other things that
I just haven't opened yet some wet and
wild piles I have an open you know what
I mean so um yeah eventually I will get
around to all of these things but it
really is like a treasure trove I love
opening this Shore and just getting
excited about all the things I'm gonna
get to try so yeah that's what's in that
drawer we're going to move on to the
other side and now we are on the left
side and we're going to start in the top
drawer so in this store is kind of my
everyday drawer this is the one I open
more often than I hope
anything and that is because I keep
items that I reach for the most in here
or items that I'm wanting to try out and
so I'm intentionally placing them in
here you know and that changes almost
every single day if not every other day
just to try out a lot of the products
and make sure I'm using a lot of
different products as well so this
container is one of my favorites I got
at Walmart for like two dollars and
fifty cents in the office supply section
and has all these little compartment
it's perfect it really is perfect
so in here I've got my mary-lou manizer
I've just gotten recently I'm wanting to
try out as well as this covergirl trio
and shimmering sands or something that
everyone talks about oh no did I like to
take it off and not ever yeah I think
it's called shimmering sands I guess it
doesn't really matter but kind of
matters because I'm loving it right now
anyway so then I have my depotted yellow
HD powder from ELF that I use on my
under-eye my depotted vitamin E cream I
use every single day is my day cream
then I have two eyeshadows I reach for a
ton my sila kitten and then my wet and
wild brulee that I use it broke and I
delete kind of fix it I use that to
blend two colors together and then my
Anastasia brow powder and medium brown
that I use absolutely every day this is
actually from my hoola bronzer but I
actually use this to apply to apply any
bronzer as a contour because it's the
perfect shape and then my Beauty Blender
that needs a cleaning but it's getting
worn down and I actually was telling
someone on Instagram that I accidentally
ripped my Beauty Blender my other when I
had to it's actually back here and I
guess laughs I glued it together I don't
I don't think I can still use I mean
maybe but there's like a hard part in
the middle now because it's the glue
because it ripped in half isn't that
crazy
anyway so I also back here have my like
on the spot Neutrogena stuff some
chapstick that thing came off tweezers
let's see am i clear brow gel from uh
Nastasia a thing I'm trying to use up
here a little eyeliner from Smashbox
some other eyeliners Palladio ones I'm
trying out my essence one I use every
single day
mascara I use everyday lipstick I'm
trying out from L'Oreal and then a pore
refining primer I'm trying out from
quake eyelash curlers this is my eye
cream I'm using right now that I found
that I live and then up here I have a
London Soho beauty blender I'm probably
going to do a review video comparing
this to the Beauty Blender and then I
have my elf brush cleanser vitamin E
night repair cream I've been using at
night and then my new palette from my
friend amber it's from Mac it's the
Rebecca Moses face kit in brown and it
has oh my gosh just look how gorgeous
that is there's some lip products some
shadows some blush I love it
so I keep that there because I've been
reaching for that every day I just have
a little office supply thing holding my
kabuki brush a mini kabuki brush my
freaking broken Beauty Blender back here
I just have a thing to hold my hair back
when I get ready and I think that's
pretty much it in this drawer so yeah
this drawer changes all the time now for
the second drawer down my house most of
my eyeshadows so this is a Dollar
General container here that I've shown a
bunch of and in it I keep all my L'Oreal
infallible shadows oh I love them all of
my Maybelline Color tattoos are in here
I was really excited about is this the
one yeah strawberry blonde I finally
found I was so excited I couldn't find
it for the longest time so I loved all
of those and then I also have some color
tattoo pigments back here then in these
these are both from Target these little
things that were in the target dollar
section two in a pack I have a few more
pigments in them I guess I could kind of
stick them in here really is where I
meant for them to be and this one's a
Mac one in tan it's pretty and then I
just have some like quads and your
Physicians Formula ones that I haven't
even tried yet that I recently got that
I'll be trying soon Sigma went wild etc
and then back here I actually just have
some brow products I don't use very
often because I use the Anastasia I
still like them but I just right now I'm
not reaching for them so I'm not too
concerned about them being hidden
because
go out any further then this is another
one of those dollar store serving trays
with three compartments in this one I
have like all of my singles so I've got
some elf singles some covergirl Singles
Gemma kid one while then here I have my
most used quads and things like that so
this Archie girl Mac one I love this
Pilate oh one Sonia Kashuk and a
philosophy one so I love all those and
then these are just kind of like some
cream sticks like my next rebel I
pencils some smoky shadow blasts and
then this is like a clinic little one so
that is what is in that drawer so the
third drawer down and again it starts
with the deep drawers is where I keep
all of my foundation and my palettes
kind of an interesting mix I know so
again this is the dollar store serving
tray that has three compartments in the
front I have my magic Lumi Revlon

haven't tried out yet I'm really excited
to try and review for you guys so you
can see I have a lot of different shades
some are darker summer lighter again
four different times of the year like
this one I'm starting to get a lot paler
because we're turning into fall so this
is kind of more of a summer one I think
I might buy it in a lighter shade though
cuz I love this foundation got my wet
mile cover all one of my faves this
covergirl one I haven't gotten to try I
think it might have broken me out which
breaks my heart but I want to try it
some more to make sure or to see just
some other drugstore ones I've got a
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer some BB
creams back here even a sample anytime I
get samples I like to keep them with my
foundations and elf mineral foundation
this Palladio wet and dry foundation
that I love again I'll be reviewing soon
I have some empty Mac pallets back here
because there's such a good deal
recently so I've got a duo a quad and
then some a large one and an eyeshadow
pan and then over here I'm actually
going to come on this side so these are
my palettes here got some wet and wild
ones my favorite is the comfort zone so
that's kind of in the front I have the
BH Hollywood palette love love all of
these these benefit world famous
neutrals I've got my two naked palettes
my naked 2 is a little bit newer but I
love them and this one's seen a lot of
love
sure my shady lady from the bomb it's
the volume one pallet I on neutral
palette from Sonia Kashuk this is my Mac
palette and in it I actually just have
mostly elf shadows I've got this one
from Mac and then that one here is from
Mac and then the rest of them are elf so
we'll see how full this eventually gets
I don't know I love the elf shadows I
also want to try makeup geek which I've
heard fit in these as well so we will
see and then I've got a an Urban Decay
palette here this orgeous by uni palette
which is like a hard covered palette and
I just it's a mess in there I know but
it's great for travel because you can
just throw things into it's magnetized
and it comes with magnets it's got a big
mirror and then it shuts like that which
I think it's pretty cool so that is
what's in that and then back here I have
a BH Cosmetics jenny rivera palette
which is gorgeous and I think that is
all that is in that drawer so now in
this fourth drawer down we go into some
hair products so actually first this is
a drying mat that you can set like on
your counter top and it's like thicker
and kind of foamy and I put it on top of
my vanity there and it's so perfect
instead of using a towel it's a little
more structured which I like and I can
wash it you know just in the washer
dryer it is so perfect and it was a
dollar at the dollar store and they had
different colors so I really recommend
that if you do have like a vanity where
you do make it protects your thing and
it's a little more structure than towel
which I like but I just keep it on top
of all of this so I've got like my
curling irons and my curling wand this
is one of my favorites my pro beauty
tools curling wand hairdryer then in
this little Victoria Secret bag I keep
like my hair ties and things like that
in here so love all of that and like
little bows and then this is my
hairbrush and then in here I keep more
hair if I can get it out let's see what
happens here this is hard to open there
we go
I keep extra hair things like a bun
thing I've like never used yeah like
little headbands and things like that so
it's kind of perfect little packaging
like that are so perfect to keep isn't
it cute
I couldn't bear to throw that away
anyway so that's what's in that drawer
not too exciting but certainly
functional and then in this last drawer
we've got nail products so I told you I
had some extra nail polishes I keep in
these target $1.00 containers ones that
I either am NOT currently reaching for
they're more summery and I'm just not
using right now but I love them just the
same so that's in that back here I have
some brushes I don't use as often some
empties just random stuff really some
more empties you're gonna be seeing soon
these were from my um those things that
are holding my lipsticks these are the
things that were in them actually
nothing there was actually a lot more
but you'll see where they are so these I
got from the target dollar section you
might recognize I love these they got
all bent up though but I used to hold my
brushes in them but I switched that up
recently so I have some glitter nail
polishes in here that I'm just not
reaching for right now I don't wear
glitter all too often right now and then
I in here I've just got like base and
top coats and nail treatments like the
natural nail strengthener from OPI nail
Envy things like that just chill in
there this is another IKEA container and
I have little Mickey baby cotton swabs
Oh cute all kinds of things nail polish
removers like that then this is really
really cool I found this at Kmart for
like a sorry I'm trying to find a place
to set it down for like five bucks and
it has this little drawer where I'm
keeping all those things that I got in
those containers and then just all kinds
of nail products you know like a buffer
type thing a nail file keep my base and
topcoat that I'm using right now which I
love the Revlon Colorstay base and top
could have been using for like two years
now cotton rounds cuticle nippers all
kinds of things some cuticle products
like an Essie disappearing trick one elf
conditioning one yeah so I just thought
that was so cool and that a cool little
container so yeah that's pretty much
within that drawer okay so I hope that
was really enjoyable for you I hope it
was at least close to as enjoyable as it
was for me to make it because I love
these kinds of videos so much and I was
thinking about it I was like gosh these
videos are all so similar
like everyone kind of stores them in
similar ways but then it's like duh
because once you see a great way to
store something why wouldn't you want to
store it in that great way you know but
um yeah I just hope you learned about
maybe some new places that you can get
some storage containers that maybe
didn't think about like the dollar store
or the Target dollar section always has
great stuff and it's always really
really cheap so that's why it's just
like awesome you know um but yeah so I
hope you learned something new and I
hope you enjoyed it I know I did and I
will see you guys very soon please
subscribe and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
