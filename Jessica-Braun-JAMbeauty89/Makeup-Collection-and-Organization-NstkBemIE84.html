is time for me to do a makeup collection
video and I know you're all just so
excited I know I am so just a little
preface disclaimer and I get so annoyed
with these when people do it but mine's
a little different I actually think my
collections kind of modest compared to
most people on YouTube now obviously
this is more makeup than I would ever
actually need but it's kind of a hobby
of mine and I enjoy doing it and so yeah
that is my little disclaimer so I'll
give you kind of a there's me in the
mirror hello
but yeah so here's an overview of it
this table I actually just got an Ikea
it's only like 25 bucks but I like that
it's got a lot of space on it so back
here I keep my mirror that you know
lights up and it's got two different
magnifications but I never use the like
crazy magnified side because it's just
scary right am i right ladies okay so
over here I keep my perfumes I've got my
flower bomb by Viktor and Rolf
I love miss dior is my absolute favorite
and the bottle is so cute and my
boyfriend got me actually all of these
perfumes and different occasions but
this one he bought me when we were in
Disney World which I know you guys know
that I'm totally obsessed and so was my
boyfriend but this one he bought for me
when we were in Epcot in the France
pavilion and so now like the scent has
all these memories tied to it and he
even said the other day that he loves
when I wear it because it reminds him of
Disney World and then this is Viva La
Juicy which is actually the second
bottle maybe even third that I've gone
through of this scent I love that scent
so I just couldn't keep those there and
then this let me move back into position
I use for my palate just an office file
type of thing which I know a lot of
people use but this one I got at the
Target office supply section so in and
I've got my Naked palette a bunch of wet
and wild palettes I've got shimmer the
night away sparkle till morning drinking
a glass of shine which used to be called
I heart matte because these are matte
shadows comfort zone and actually a lot
of those were given to me by a friend
that just recently sent them to me and I
am so forever grateful because I love
love love playing with those and then
the shady lady the bomb vol.1 palette
which I love another wet and wild one
back there and then this is my Unni
palette I got the black they have a lot
of different colors
around $25 if I'm not mistaken these are
great for travel because they're hard
they clasp shut and they have a big
mirror which is great and it holds its
position so you can really use it to get
ready when you're traveling but I just
keep lots of depotted shadows and some
elves some wet-and-wild some Mary Kay
even a blush in there and then my NYX
eyebrow cake powder that I use for my
brows that's great for travel it really
is so let's see up here I've got a
mirror again guys and then I've got this
candle this is just a Yankee candle
vanilla berry it smells so good but I
love the holder it's from Bath &amp;amp; Body
which they have so many different kinds
and a lot of stores now sell these and I
love them I've actually seen them at
Kohl's for really good deals as well
different types of holders and you can
even get them for like different
holidays I love that um so Minnie and
Mickey of course are watching me get
ready every morning but they fall over
so easily that's what I guess that's
what I get I got them from the Dollar
Tree quick they're so cute
anyway so these I recently hauled these
little canisters I got from the target
dollar section they're just so cute and
they're really big so you can hold a lot
of things in each one so these are my
face brushes I've got some Real
Techniques some Sigma I know you guys
they're dirty don't tell on me some elf
some bareMinerals and then I also keep
my headband that I use to kind of hold
my hair back when I'm putting my makeup
on so I kind of keep that in there as
well
and then over in this one I keep my eye
brushes a comb I also keep my eye
homecontroller so I can change the song
you know tweezers all kinds of things in
there so then over here I've got my
towel just stored back here I kind of
fold it up and I usually of course lay
it out so I don't get my just kind of I
don't want to ruin my table with makeup
and nail polish and stuff so over here I
used another office organizer to
organize my beauty blenders just kind of
hold on to them and my ELF kabuki which
is a really nice kabuki brush for six
bucks and then whatever nail polish I'm
wearing I'll usually throw in here just
so I can easily find it if I need to
repair this is the Rimmel 60 seconds I
got from Walmart actually it's in the
shade mint Alicia's it's so pretty
and I really like the formula I was so
pleasantly surprised because these are
only like a dollar fifty and with a
coupon they're only fifty
but of course okay so here's stuff I've
talked about most of this stuff the
suave dry shampoo found a big fan out
because I have dark hair matrix sleek
iron smoother heat spray I like the
suave shine spray I really like this is
one of my absolute favorites they got to
be powder 'fl it's a powder you put in
your hair to add volume and it's just
great and it's really really inexpensive
just a generic contact solution my holy
grail hairspray the bedhead masterpiece
this is usually in a teal bottle this
was just a limited edition pink which I
was pretty excited that it was pink but
so if you're looking for it it'll be in
a teal bottle but it's just wonderful it
smells great and it's the exact right
about of hold I love it
another home an the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray I use all the time
it's wonderful it just lets your makeup
last all day it's the best and then the
not your mother's beach babe texturizing
sea salt spray I really like and it
smells like coconut and it just adds
some grit to your hair really like that
in this containers from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and I really like it it's cute
gold one okay so getting into the actual
makeup so up here these are pretty small
I got these two containers from the
target bathroom organization section and
I think they were under $10 you guys can
probably tell me if you see my haul
video for these I know they were on sale
when I got of course so anyway I've got
some lip butters some Revlon lip stick
some Maybelline Baby Lips sugar one down
here a lot of my lip products are
actually in my purse right now so
they're all in here my some Revlon
lipsticks a Maybelline a Mac and then
some other lip products I don't really
use very often which is why they're in
the back there I'm some more random lip
things the Smashbox the Revlon pink
pursuit I love that
L'Oreal la bombe well maybe it's just
the bomb well I had to jazz up the name
a little bit I don't know what it's
called but I like that umm maybelline
superstay is amazing it smells great
this is in perpetual peony which is
really pretty but it really does last a
long time
L'Oreal color juice and then another
sugar lip treatment thing they're in
these drawers I keep my face primer so
this is the Clinique pore refining
solutions it's a 401 Smashbox
photo-finish is my absolute favorite
bare minerals
pair of minerals primetime is um reminds
these remind me of each other I like
that as well but I think it might be
breaking me out and this is a Clarence
one over there and here I keep my what
do I keep in here my eye primers so I've
got bourbon decay this is a clinic
actually kind of like a primer shadow
type thing it's called a lid smoothie
and it's a pink shade it's really pretty
and it's feels like refreshing on my
eyes which sounds crazy but it does the
elf eyelid primer is great and it's only
a dollar
I always repurchase that this is great
this is the elf eye primer and liner
sealer so part of its like a creamy
primer which really it has great
coverage and then the other side is like
a liquid clear liner brush and like a
clear liquid and then you can dip it in
any eyeshadow you want it creates a
liner out of it is amazing so I use it
all the time and just use the shadow
that I'm using in my eye look I'm and
then I can line under my eyes and it's
great and then I also have an essence
cream shadow in there and then I have
some moisturizers here this the origins
vitae Singh the Laura Mercier face
polish it's a 401 and then this is just
an eye cream by Biore I use it sometimes
it's almost gone actually okay so for
these three drawers I got from the
Container Store and they are I think
original price $15 but you can usually
find them on sale and these hold a lot
more than of course those do so this is
my blush drawer I'll just kind of pull
it out I've got the down boy blush wet
and wild and NYC one the elf contouring
blush and bronzing powder which they now
have a bunch of different shades of this
so online that is so you can find lots
of different combos that's great and
NARS one and then an elf
I think that's candid coral tart
Dollface the Physicians Formula happy
booster blush to Milan ease and Luminoso
and oh man what does we call barium or
nope nope Dolce pink is what it's called
and then to NYX one's dusty rose and
pinched and then Revlon cream blush in
Coral Reef I'm not a huge fan of that
cream blush get it together
there we go okay so then in here I keep
my highlighters in my bronzers I've got
the elf cream highlighter that I love
the wet and wild color icon and reserve
your Cabana it's marketed as a bronzer
but it's definitely a highlight
and this is a philosophy one I got from
like Big Lots I think a lot of these
were discontinued or something but it's
the shimmering face powder the pixie
brightening radiance powder I love this
is a Physicians Formula cashmere wear
bronzer it's a light bronzer which is
great because I've got fair skin as you
all know and the NYC sunny bronzer is a
little too dark for me but I'm holding
on to it and hopes that I get a nice tan
this summer we'll see the Tarte Park
Avenue princess one and then this is the
elf pressed powder I get some shades
darker and then I use it as a contour
and it's really nice for first I know I
talked about that one a lot as well okay
so these are my powders about the dream
matte revlon age-defying my backup of my
Rimmel stay matte which is I've been
using for I swear like seven years and
the one I'm currently using and then
this is a NYX stay matte but not flat
powder foundation which goes really
great with like BB creams because it
really does add a lot of coverage so
that's great
then I've got my eye shadow drawer at
the top of this middle one these are
kind of everything that isn't a palette
so it's singles and quads things like
that this is a matte quad but this is a
Mac shadow here it's sable but then
these three are elf shadows that I put
in to see if they fit and then I could
never get them out but it kind of made
for a nice quad so I'm not too upset
about it this is the philosophy quad I
got a big lot this is the Physicians
Formula Canyon classics that I love
bunch of matte shadows this is a sigma
one that came free with a brush purchase
some maybelline quads a friend sent me
that I love I love this top one it's in
taupe temptress I think steal a kitten a
gemma kid shadow the wet and wild i'm
brulee which is a matte nude shade which
is great for blending your shadows
together another philosophy duo Charles
of the Ritz is like an old-school brand
I don't even think they make it anymore
but this is just a really nice single
eyeshadow a L'Oreal one and iced latte a
NYX one and then some
back ones there okay so my concealer
drawer another favorite of mine so I've
got a Revlon Colorstay and the what is
this the lumi magic lumi by l'oreal i
haven't even opened it yet actually
haven't tried it two of the Maybelline
age rewind I really like those the
Rimmel match perfection Maybelline fit
me glamoflage and then I've got my
favorite favorite right now the
covergirl and Olay corrector erase paste
by benefit and then a Tarte powder that
I used to set my concealer and then in
this store I've got Maybelline BB cream
so these are basically like the
foundations I'm currently using I
actually like the BB cream it's uh I
kind of went into it knowing it wouldn't
be as high of coverages like the Eastern
BB creams are and so I went into it
thinking of it as the tinted moisturizer
and I really like it for that but it
doesn't provide a lot of coverage so you
could pair it with a powder foundation
to provide that coverage for you the
Revlon nearly naked eye like but I'm
probably not going to repurchase Revlon
Colorstay for normal to dry I have
repurchased many times and will continue
because it's my favorites and then the
Rimmel lasting finish foundation I
really really like but they have so few
shades this is the lightest shade it's
actually a little bit too dark for me
but in the summer it usually works and
then I also have a urban decay D slick
back here that I use just for travel
it's nice and small okay here
I've got eyedrops these are kind of like
eye products some eye drops some cream
shadows elf and L'Oreal Orioles my
favorite not a big fan of the elf then
I've got some eyeliners in essence one
Jordana Victoria's Secret Kasia Rimmel
and then this is the elf makeup remover
pen that I live and then here I've got
some color tattoos bad to the bronze
bold gold is that what this is yeah bold
gold and then one of my favorite
favorites bearly beige and send some NYX
glitters back here I don't really use
ever an Ulta sharpener and then some NYX
jumbo eye pencils in milk and then
cashmere and then ones in sparkle nude I
love those three and then here I've got
my mascaras I'm currently using
Maybelline the rocket one by one flirt
is a brand from Kohl's actually blink
this came in a birch box and then
Lancome Hypnose star trial thing clear
mascara I never used the alphas it's a
pur I do use and then mederma because I
my arm recently getting something out of
the oven which this would mark the
second time I've done that in my life in
my recent life so I'm trying to heal
that scar so that's why I got that and
then the brow fix brow kit by Milani and
then the last drawer is just some more
lip products some lip glosses I've got
some of the Revlon balm stain some NYX
some Revlon some NYC a Smashbox some
liners this is urban decay I've got an
EOS one and then just some NYC lip
sliders I got some in dollars for these
three shades and they're really really
nice some more lip products like blistex
and then this one I like it's the CEO
Bigelow Rose salv it's very reminiscent
of the Smiths Roselle from rose but I
think which is like a cult classic it's
been around since like the 1800s but
this one has a nicer smell and of course
it is a different brand but I really
like it so that is my whole collection
right now I will definitely continue to
do videos collection videos you know
kind of as my collection grows I'll
continue to update these but yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed if you did please
