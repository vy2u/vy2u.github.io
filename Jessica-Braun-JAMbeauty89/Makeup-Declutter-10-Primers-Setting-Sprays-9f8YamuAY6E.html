primers and my setting sprays I kind of
think of this as like the sandwich of my
face because this is what I put on first
and after I've done everything else I
put this on last so let's go ahead and
start with the primers okay first thing
is this Paula's Choice resists super
light kind of like a tinted moisturizer
it's got SPF of 30 and it's got a little
bit of color to it and I love this stuff
it's like the only SPF I have that's
tinted that doesn't make my skin look
greasy or anything like that I love it
it's almost gone I will probably
repurchase it especially in the
summertime it is amazing and this is a
great one for if you are gonna like
going on a beach vacation and you don't
want your to be bare face other than
just like a you know an SPF so this has
SPF in it as well and it's got a little
bit of tint so it's a really good one
for beach days as well so I love it
definitely gonna keep I'm gonna put the
things I'm getting rid of I'm gonna put
in here and then I'll put the things I'm
keeping off to the side this is the body
Aughra fille veil foundation primer this
I got in some sort of subscription box
and it's got a pump and it's actually
really nice so I think I'm gonna keep it
I've been using it a lot lately I just
honestly I feel like I've only had it
for a few months so I'm gonna continue
working on this one and seeing how I
like it
okay this is one that I just got in a BA
I think a boxycharm
it's a Mirabella prime for face and it's
just one of those kind of silicone
primers similar to similar to the body
ography one but I love this packaging
for travel because it's you know it's
not really big and bulky it's not glass
or anything like that it's just perfect
to toss in and that way I don't feel
guilty about bringing a giant primer you
know it really doesn't take up much
space so plus I haven't really gotten to
try it much lately and by lately I mean
ever okay this is the elf HD mattifying
bomb I don't really know I can't decide
how I feel about this I've only used it
a few times I've heard you should put it
on under your makeup I've heard you
should put it on like to touch up
throughout the day which I don't I don't
know I've used it under my
make up and it's okay but I know that
I'm never gonna reach for it so I might
pass it on and give it away this is
something else sent to me so I wouldn't
sell it or anything like that but I
think I might pass it on to his sister
or a friend because I'm just not
reaching for it ever it's a nice product
though I'm just not reaching it for it
okay this is an anti pour it's dr. young
I got it in a Mimi box a dr. young pour
something pour a racer bomb and it's a
jar which you guys know I don't like jar
packaging and it's a really you know
again a really silicone II feeling to it
but I'm never using it I'm just gonna
pass it on while it's still new because
I haven't had it for very long maybe a
few months so I'm gonna pass it on this
is the it cosmetics bye bye redness now
this I recently got and I'm definitely
keeping it's a really dark formula but
once it blends into the skin it like
melts away I don't even really know how
to describe it then of course it's
looking crazy dark on my skin right now
but I found that it really it just kind
of melts away into my skin so throughout
the day it really does cover redness
really well for me now I haven't been
reaching for it a lot lately because
I've been trying out so many foundations
and I'm just wanting to see what they do
on their own but I need to put this back
in my everyday makeup drawer because I
do like it a lot so I'm definitely
keeping that the next thing is this elf
daily moisture stick this isn't really a
primer it's kind of like a I don't
really know how to describe this but you
use it to kind of touch up any
creepiness or any dry spots on your face
anywhere I don't like stick it on just
with the thing I usually when we're up
my finger in it and then put it like if
it's under my eye because you're seeing
my fine lines you just kind of press it
into the skin and it moisturizes the
area without messing up your makeup it's
really pretty amazing and it's only like
six bucks so I'm definitely keeping that
this is the Too Faced primed and
poreless I think I'm gonna pass this on
I'm just never really reaching for it
and I have other primers that I'm
wanting to try out and the few times
I've tried this I really didn't I wasn't
that impressed so and it's not like a
full sizes the small one so I think I'm
gonna pass it on and let someone else
love on it because I'm sure someone else
would love this a lot more than I am
this is the elf mineral
face primer I've used this quite a bit
as well and I really like it so I'm
going to keep it this and the body
ography are so so similar I mean they
might as well be the exact same product
this here is this cheek room makeup base
and it's green tinted again I got this
in a meanie box it is a true green now
if you've got a super red face this
might be fantastic for you to cancel out
redness for me I don't have that much
redness I mean I do from time to time
but I'm just I've never reached for it I
think I've used it maybe once so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that on as well
the last thing in here for primers is
this Becca shimmering skin Perfector I'm
assuming it's probably yeah it's an opal
I mean I should try it everyone talks
about it and why not at least give it a
try so I'll keep this for now I don't
use it within the next month I'm gonna
pass it on but I I should try cuz
everyone's talked about it and I really
don't keep samples but this is like the
only one I've held onto so I'll keep
that moving forward this is my Urban
Decay all nighter spray it's the excel
like giant one I've had this this
forever I mean since before I had a
channel and it is still like I want to
say half --lo I kinda want to look
inside and see ya a little less than
half full it's in the old packaging but
I love it and it really is good I don't
use settings for every single day so but
when I do or when I know that I'm going
out all night I mean truly I will use
this so I love it I'm definitely gonna
keep it it's seen a lot of love I wonder
how there's like an expiration on this
cuz I have had it for a while so works
doesn't smell weird this I just got and
am going to review if I haven't reviewed
it yet
it's the L'Oreal infallible makeup
extender setting spray and it goes along
with thier infallible foundation this is
really nice you guys absolutely
comparable to the all-nighter a lot
cheaper it's still like $14 or $13 which
is expensive for a drugstore but it is a
really good product just the same kind
of a nozzle it does a really good job of
spreading like a fine mist over your
face it's not all junkie or anything so
definitely keeping that
this one is the Mary Kay makeup
finishing spray it's also honestly
really good in this one I've traveled
with quite a bit because it's a good
travel size and and I know that it's
really good again it's one that it holds
on to your makeup all day just like the
all-nighter so I like that this one is
the mac fix+ which I use to make powder
shadows into kind of more like foiled
almost shadows but also you know you can
do so much with this you can use it just
to kind of put all over your face to get
rid of any powder enos in this size is I
want to say only like ten dollars so
reality you could try the mac fix+ for
less than what you'd spend on the
l'oreal of course with the Mac you're
getting only 1 ounce versus 3.4 so keep
that in mind but you can try back
products for a lot cheaper than you
think if you didn't know that so I like
that a lot the last settings where I
have is this Urban Decay b6 I never ever
use this I mean ever and I just got it
the packaging is adorable I love the
idea that you're you know infusing your
skin with minerals and vitamins but I
don't ever use it I feel like I should
give it a try though I don't know I
think I'm gonna pass it on I've only
used it like twice and you know any time
I'm wanting to infuse my skin with
vitamins minerals I'm gonna use a serum
and I love the idea that you can spray
this on but I'm just not using it so
I've got to stop holding onto things
because they're a higher more expensive
brand and you know Urban Decay is an
expensive brand and so I don't want to
get rid of this but at the same time if
I'm not using it there's no point just
keeping it for no reason if I'm gonna
have to force myself to use it so I am
just gonna do it and say goodbye to this
guy this is everything that I am keeping
and this is everything I'm getting rid
of I decided to go ahead and get rid of
this body ography one as well after I
thought about it because it's just like
the elf mineral one that I already have
that I already know I like so there's
not really a point in keeping bold and
I'm not going to work through them
anytime soon so I'm not really concerned
about
running out of the Alfa needing that
because like I said I don't use primer
every single day I'm proud of myself for
getting rid of a few nicer brand more
expensive things that I feel like you
know in my heart I'm like no I don't
want to get rid of it it's urban decay
or it's two-faced but the reality is I
am just not using it there's no point in
keeping it just to have it because it's
gonna go bad and someone right now could
be using it that would love it so I
think I did a pretty good job I've
certainly got plenty of primers but not
too many same as setting sprays enough
for me to have a kind of an eclectic
collection to be able to review here on
my channel and to use on an everyday
basis if you're interested in other
declutter videos I've got a ton up I can
link the entire playlist below or even
the first video so you can start at the
very beginning when I go through my lip
products lipsticks and lipglosses and
things like that
so if you're interested go check that
out and subscribe for more and I'll
catch you guys in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
