we are going to tackle in today's
decluttering video these are all my like
true concealers and then these are
powders that are either concealer
powders like this one or that's how I
use them so these are ones that I use to
set my under eye in different capacities
so I figured we'll just go through all
of those together so let's go ahead and
get started with the these powders the
first thing is this bareMinerals
concealer it's in the shade well rested
and this is this yellow ish powder I
don't want to say yellow yellow but it's
got it kind of a yellow tint to it and I
know it looks really dark in here but it
looks amazing I mean it brightens the
under eye like crazy you can literally
use this and no concealer at all
underneath it and it does the job on its
own which is the whole idea but it looks
even more amazing over another concealer
so I'm definitely keeping this this was
some of the best like eighteen dollars
I've ever spent in my life seriously
amazing this is a Laura Mercier powder
it's the universal setting powder and it
came in I don't even know what I want to
say I think it came in an Ipsy bag
honestly it was one of those like whoa
surprise moments and it's just a white
translucent powder and it does a really
good job of setting the under eyes so I
think I will keep this and this is one
of the few that genuinely like kind of
masks your fine lines I was very
surprised at how well listed so I'm
definitely gonna keep this is something
I love it's such a gem this is the elf
eye brightener in buff and it's similar
to the bare minerals one their like
basically the same product so if you
don't want to spend all the money on
that this is just as amazing I love them
both so much so in this one you know
it's like either three or five dollars I
think just three on elfs website so
definitely definitely check it out if
you've been wanting the bare minerals
one because this is so much cheaper and
it is amazing
this one I think I'm gonna pass on this
is a Tarte one and it's hard to say bye
to Tarte because I love Tarte products
but it's there
smooth operator finishing powder and a
lot of people love this and I like it as
well it's very similar to the Laura
Mercier but I
don't feel like I need to and I think I
like the laura mercier one just a little
bit better so that is why I'm justifying
keeping that one and getting rid of this
one because if I keep both there's no
point I'm not using either one of them
enough to keep two of them so I'm
definitely gonna get rid of this one
these are the same thing this is I
actually just put this in here these are
elf powders and it's the HD not the
under eye setting powder even though
that's the jar it's and it's just their
HD powder that comes in a big one but
it's incorrect of yellow and it is such
a good one
but that thing is humongous so I just
put it in one of these this came with a
different powder in it that had some
sparkle in it and I didn't really like
it so I just dumped it and now I'm using
it so I think what I'm gonna do is not
get rid of this but I'm gonna pour the
powder back in the original and clean
this out so I can use it for other
travel sized things because I certainly
don't need both and it's the exact same
powder and this this packaging makes a
little more sense with it so I'm gonna
keep that and sort of get rid of that
this here we go this is what I am the
most excited to do to go through my
concealers I love most of them so I
can't foresee myself getting rid of too
many and I work through concealers like
I genuinely use concealers up so I don't
foresee myself getting rid of all too
many but we'll see the first one is this
Rimmel match perfection I have tried to
get rid of this a thousand times and I
always end up keeping it because I try
it again and fall in love with it again
the packaging the brush tip is great
except for it looks it gets so messy
inside it makes me crazy so I am and II
keep this but I want to try and just use
it up all the way I think this blends so
nicely into the skin so I'm gonna keep
it but once it's gone I don't know if
I'll repurchase it but maybe it is good
so definitely gonna keep that this is
one of my Holy Grails the Maybelline
Dream Lumi touch ones in radiant I love
it definitely keeping okay so I have two
of these Mac ones I have in
nc15 and n c20 and c22 dark can you guys
see the difference in NC 20 is the one I
bought originally and it's so dark I
don't know what I was thinking so I'm
gonna keep the NC 15 and pass on the NC
2000 it breaks my heart so good buy that
one it's really hard to say goodbye I
love this one okay alright just move on
this is another Holy Grail the instant
age rewind again it's in like a pinkish
brightener shade I love it I've bought
this like three times just I've bought
this one three times as well I love both
of these I'm definitely keeping them I
will certainly use them up because I do
every single time this is the hard candy
glamoflauge and this is one that I talk
about a lot because it's absolutely
amazing I have it in light I think they
might sell ultra light now I might have
made that up in my head but it is such a
good concealer I know it's got mixed
reviews some people love it some people
hate it but for days that I'm like oh my
gosh like my skin is a mess I need
heavy-duty something this is usually my
go-to because it really is amazing I
mean people have tried well people have
used it to cover up tattoos and from
what I've heard it works pretty well I
don't know I'll have tattoos and I'm not
trying to cover them up if I did so but
it's great so I'm definitely keeping
this and you really can't beat the price
for something this amazing this is my
Yves pearl salmon concealer and Mary
over at a love tart if you watch her
videos on YouTube I love her and I have
watched her for years and she always
raves about this and so I bought it when
it was on HauteLook
at some point and it was a really good
deal and this is amazing because it's so
so creamy and when I put it on my eyes
it just feels like it literally feels
like medicine for my under eyes I feel
like all day my under eyes feel
moisturized it's the weirdest thing I've
never experienced it with another
concealer and it is a treatment
concealer so I guess that makes sense
but I love this stuff if you ever see it
on HauteLook pick one up because it is a
amazing now I do have to set this with
some sort of powder of some kind because
it's so moisturizing that it kind of
settles into lines but if you set it
with the powder in those areas then
you're gonna be good to go you're gonna
love this so I'm definitely keeping that
this is one this is the fit me concealer
that I have been trying out and
reviewing and seeing how I like
definitely gonna keep this I do like it
so far
a lot of people however compared it to
the NARS radiant creamy concealer I
don't understand that because I don't
think they're that similar at all
I really don't so and I think this is
the lightest shade I have it in ten
light and let me know if you know if
there's a lighter shade of this out
because this is still pretty dark
compared to this one and the shade I
have in NARS is vanilla and it's not
even the lightest shade they sell so I
do feel like Maybelline needs to come
out with maybe one at least one lighter
shade but I like both of them I'm
keeping both of them so there's that
this is the magic lumi by L'Oreal here's
what kills me about this I wanted to
love this as much as I love my
Maybelline one because this is the
prettiest packaging I mean you can't get
prettier than that and it's got the
brush applicator but I just don't love
this I don't think it's a bad concealer
by any means but I just feel like this
one blends more seamlessly into the skin
that there's no point in me keeping this
even though it kills me because it is so
pretty but I'm never using it okay this
is the benefit erase paste and this is
just amazing this is one that I let my
mom use for awhile when she had got a
black eye from falling it's a long story
my poor mama but and that was a while
ago that was like a year or two ago but
she used this to help cover up and it
did it did such an amazing job of
covering that up so it's in number one
fair and it's just kind of this I'm
gonna swatch it for you guys cuz it's
such an interesting it feels almost like
putty and it's like this again kind of
salmon colored concealer and it's very
emollient like greasy and moisturizing
but at the same time crazy high coverage
it's
it's such an anomaly like I don't even
understand it but it really is amazing I
think this product comes with like a
little spatula type thing but I I'm sure
I threw that away a long time ago I've
had it for quite a while but love this
stuff I think it's amazing the next
thing in here is this Tarina tarantino
concealer well it's like a brightener
stick it's an eye dream hyper light and
I don't remember if this is something I
bought on HauteLook or if it came in a
subscription box but this is like a
pinkish tone I guess concealer it's so
more like a brightener or whatever but I
just don't ever use it and what I have
it's good but I don't love it so I'd
rather I've got enough that I don't feel
the need to keep this although again
I've been keeping it because of the
packaging it's so cute so I've got to
stop being so silly like that and just
pass it on get rid of it yes okay this
is just something it's like a little
travel you know jar or whatever but I
use the lid I put my mac prolongwear
concealer in it because it the pump
pumps out way too much so knowing that
I'll pump it into here and use it for a
few days but this needs to be cleaned
out clearly so I'm gonna put it to the
side to clean out and yeah cuz it's
gross gross gross gross this is the elf
complete coverage concealer palette in
light and it's a pretty good palette you
guys I've got to admit I thought for
sure it'd be really drying because you
guys know I love elf but at the same
time some of the products are duds and I
thought oh my gosh
just looking these are unswept just
looking at those wouldn't you think like
no way that's gonna be good these are so
creamy and this is what I use a lot not
necessarily my under-eye but when I need
to conceal something on my face so if
I've got a breakout or just some redness
sometimes I burned my face with my
curling wand so if I burned my face with
my curling wand I will usually use one
of these two shades just to cover that
area because it gives enough coverage to
cover it but it also isn't super thick
like this is so so it's not
super-dee-duper obvious so I do like
this for that reason so I'm going
two kids this came in a subscription box
this is the Coastal Scents Eclipse
palette and it's got 15 concealer shades
now this is such a cool product but I
never use it and I just got it I know
but I've you know swatched a few I've
tried it a few times I've used this for
cream Brasi that's true I use that for
cream bronzer I've used these shades to
contour with actually and it actually
did a really nice job so now I'm
thinking maybe I shouldn't get rid of it
but I don't do that often enough to keep
this I might just go and get some sort
of cream contour stick or something
instead of keeping this because you know
if I wanted to travel with the cream
contour I'm not going to bring this
whole palette so I think I might pass
this on now and just keep my eyes peeled
for like a drugstore I know you can get
like darker concealer sticks like
L'Oreal has one I could get it in a
darker shade and that would work for me
so I'm gonna go ahead and pass this on
while it's still pretty new while
someone might love it okay so here's the
result of this declutter these are what
I'm keeping and this is what I'm getting
rid of you know I probably could have
gotten rid of more but a lot of these
this one this one and this one are
almost completely used up so those will
be three of them will be gone very
shortly for my collection the rest of
them I use for different reasons or
they're brand new and I'm still trying
out like the fit me one so I don't feel
bad for what I'm keeping here because I
genuinely love and use all of the ones
that are in front of me now over here
I'm proud of myself because this Mac one
I thought I would never get rid of
because I was making excuses in my head
like well you know maybe I'll use it if
I ever get really tan like now because
my under eye I'm not gonna want to look
that dark anyway so insane with these
like with packaging I'm like I don't
want to get rid of those they're so cute
and they look so pretty in my collection
but it's dumb
it is so dumb of me to try and keep
things like that because yeah they're
pretty and you know if I wanted to I
could and it's no big deal
it really is no big deal but I know that
someone else would love these and
they're just sitting there and
eventually they'll go bad and then I'll
have to toss them anyways so and same
with this in this so even though these
especially these three are high-end
brands I
out of myself for just saying goodbye to
them if I'm not using them hopefully
