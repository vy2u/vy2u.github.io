like there is no organization in this
anymore whatsoever back when I
originally put this in here it was and
this like it was these were blushes and
I don't even remember like bronzers were
in the middle and then highlights were
over here but then I started getting
some palettes and then I got you know
kind of different types of blushes like
these stick blush isn't like wow so like
in the end it's now a mess I mean you
can see there used to be some
organization I think I'm gonna start
with the bronzers and highlighters and
go from there so I'm gonna pull this out
or at least pull out the bronzers and
highlighters first just to kind of go
through those and see what I'm gonna
keep hopefully I can whittle this down
enough so I feel like I'm not just
completely overwhelmed okay so we are
gonna start with my highlighters I think
this is all that I own I'm hoping I kind
of went through I keep a lot in my
everyday makeup drawer so I tried to
make sure so I think I've got all my
highlighters upon first glance by the
way doesn't this look like Taylor Swift
like that legitimately looks like Taylor
Swift okay so let's just start on one
end and work our way through this is
this manna sheer glow highlight cream
eye pink creams do not make sense with
my skin tone they look gorgeous on
deeper skin tones but on one that's as
fair as mine it just looks silly like it
looks pink so it doesn't it just doesn't
work so I'm gonna pass this on I think
I've literally only swatched it once
because I saw that like that's not gonna
work so this is going to leave the
benefit high beam I actually use a lot
and if you don't know what the benefit
high beam product is it looks like a
nail polish but it's this like beautiful
cream highlight that it just looks so
beautiful on your cheekbones I don't
really use it anywhere else but it just
looks so beautiful and shimmery but not
glittery it is so nice it really does
look nice so and this I've had this for
I mean not that long
but for a while and it's it's still
perfect like it's in perfect condition I
just always make sure I shake it up
before I use it so love that definitely
gonna keep that this I tried to find
like a month ago to mix with foundation
because I heard you know it looks
beautiful that way and could not find it
anywhere
found out that it was hidden beneath my
heaps of makeup in there so I was
ecstatic to find it because I do want to
use it I hate when jars get that like
come on oh well but I actually want to
swatch this this is just this whoa
clearly I hadn't used it that was like
hardened but it's just this gorgeous
like golden yeah I guess it's a
highlight but really the idea behind it
because on my skin tone I wouldn't be
able to necessarily put that on I mean I
guess I could as a highlight it just
have to be really yeah I could but I've
heard people put a tiny bit of this in
their foundation and apparently it's
absolutely gorgeous which I would bet it
is so I'm gonna keep this for now and
give it a try so this is the mary lou
manizer from the balm i got this a long
time ago when it was on sale on
HauteLook for like ten bucks it's the
most beautiful highlight but the problem
is it's kind of hard to wear with my
skin tone because it is more of a
yellowish one so when I wear this I have
to be I just have to use such a light
hand so I think I'm going to keep it for
now but I do want to make sure that I am
just careful with it I mean honestly
this I'm gonna go through both of these
together I'm definitely keeping these
not because they're matte because you
know I'm trying to work on not keeping
things just because they're name-brand
I'm keeping these because they're
amazing this I just recently got in
lightscapade and it's the prettiest non
glittery but still shimmery highlight I
can't really it doesn't do it justice
like swatches don't quite look right but
it's it's just it's like out of this
world I don't know how to describe this
it's so beautiful so I'm definitely
keeping that this I'm keeping this as
Max MSF and soft and gentle this is what
I always wear for like a glamorous look
but I can still wear it during the day
which i think is awesome so I'm
definitely keeping that that is a cult
classic for a reason this is my wet and
wild reserve your
Cabana and this is like a finely milled
highlight powder it's marketed as a
bronzer but it is so beautiful it looks
it makes your skin look so radiant
without having any shimmer or glitter it
is so amazing
and if you haven't tried this you've got
to go out and try it because it's like
399 I've already hit pan and I'm pretty
sure the expiration date is coming up
because this has SPF so I'm gonna keep
it for now but I need to within the next
month or two just buy a new one and get
rid of this because the expiration date
like I said is coming up this is a star
looks loose highlights the only loose
highlight I have and this is my go-to
for when I want like an absolutely
beautiful glittery look and I know it
looks really dark but it blends really
light on the skin but it's not this
beautiful finely milled glitter in it
and like I said I do not use this during
the day or for an everyday anything I
just use it for special occasions so
definitely keeping this it's the only
thing I have like it this one I'm so on
the fence this is a Tarte one it's in
rose and it's an Amazonian clay
shimmering powder but it's like too dark
like doesn't that almost look like a
bronzer and it blends to be a little bit
lighter but it's still way too dark for
my skin tone and every time I've ever
used it I just think to myself nope no
way and I don't know maybe this is meant
to be more of a blush now that I'm like
thinking about it but I still don't
really like it on my skin so even though
it kills me because this is not cheap I
am just gonna say goodbye to it because
someone else will love it so much more
and look how cute this packaging is oh
my gosh okay so moving on to bronzers
here I've moved them into the way I'm
actually pretty proud I mean I know I've
got more bronzers that I need and more
highlights that I need but I didn't have
as much of them as I had thought so that
is a little bit more encouraging and the
fact of the matter is I really do like
the ones that I have for the most part I
actually really do use so we're gonna go
through and see if there are any that
I'm willing to part with just yet okay
the hoola bronzer this is really nice
you guys and I know that everyone talks
about it I think it still works
for fair skin although it's not like a
Holy Grail product by any means I've got
it and I use it but if I ever ran out of
it I don't think I would ever rebuy it
because it's nice but I've discovered
better ones so like I said I will use it
up and it's really nice and if you're a
little Tanner than I am it's even better
but I don't think it's anything to write
home about honestly but definitely gonna
keep it I will use it up this is the let
me get it out of the way there this
haven't just sit on my desk here is that
alright with you this is the Tarte Park
Avenue princess bronzer and it's like a
deluxe sample which I love when they do
deluxe samples cuz honestly this could
be a full size like it's enough in here
that like this is a full size and it's
the same size so the reality is it's a
really good deal and I don't go through
bronzer that quickly I really like this
this is one that I reach for all the
time it's not as dark and it's also
honestly not really that pigmented you
can kind of see it's it's a lot lighter
and it does have kind of an orange tint
to it but it really is nice as an
all-over bronzer in the summer for
someone as fair as me and I like that
it's got a shimmer to it
I wouldn't necessarily contour with it I
mean you could but I know it wouldn't
look right but it really is nice so if
you're as fair as I am and you're just
looking for a nice all-over bronzer it's
not too crazy I think you'd really like
this because it is a little bit lighter
they now have the Park Avenue princess
in matte which I have not tried but
might be nice but the shimmer and this
is not really noticeable at all so I
don't mind it so I'm gonna keep that
okay moving forward this is the Kevin
oak wand
sculpting powder and medium that I talk
about all the time that I adore it's
super-dee-duper expensive like $40.00
expensive but it's an amazing contour
powder I won't talk any more about it
because I talk about it all the time it
is amazing it's one of the very few
super expensive products I own that out
of any honestly this is like one of my
favorite products out of any makeup
product ever so this is something that
when I run out I probably will rebuy but
definitely keeping obviously okay this
is this Ofra Americano bronzer now this
a lot of us got in our box
charm a while ago and it's not it's not
bad but it's just dark and I'd heard
Andre Amati on Oh speak about this and
she made me kind of liked it more
because I had gotten as well and she's
as fair as I am and she said she you
know kind of lightly dusted it
everywhere and she was she said she was
surprised how good it looked even though
she was really fair and so I tried it
and honestly I was surprised too it
really was a good bronzer but I I'm just
not reaching for it out of my bronzers
so again I figure I might as well pass
it on while it's still decently new so
someone else can love on it so I'm gonna
pass that one on this is the pixie
bronzer that a lot of people hated it's
the subtly sun touched one and it's
really really light for a bronzer so and
that was most people's gripe and they
felt that it wasn't pigmented now I love
it because even though it's light I
think it's okay pigmented but it's like
a brown tone like it almost a gray taupe
tone to it so for someone who spares me
it's an awesome bronzer so I am
definitely keeping it the only downside
is you can tell like it's getting kind
of old so I don't know I think I'm gonna
keep it for now I need to like wipe it
off I think I'm gonna keep it for now I
might like scrape past the first layer
and see if it's any better down there if
it's not I'll probably pass it on or
well honestly if it's not all obviously
throw it away but yeah I just I love
this and I think the packaging is cute
for pixie products and I really like
that stuff this is the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer everybody and
their mom talks about and this is again
a deluxe sample even though I mean are
you ever going to use more than that no
so it's a lot darker of a bronzer it's
you know it's nicely pigmented but I
mean it is kind of more of an orange
bronzer I think this is gonna kill me
but I think I'm gonna pass it on because
you know I love that it smells like
chocolate and everyone talks about it
which is why I'm wanting to keep it but
if I'm not ever using it there's no
it doesn't really work for my skin tone
the milk chocolate would be more suited
to my skin tone so I'm gonna pass this
on even though it breaks my heart this
is the this is like a map powder
I said map Mac powder blush in the shade
is called taupe shape and I got this at
a cosmetics company outlet at my outlet
mall where they have Mac and Estee
Lauder and other products for really
cheap and I just love it it's the
perfect for me again another really
great contour powder because it's more
of a gray tone of course no no swatches
coming through it is really it's
honestly in the realm of Mac blushes
it's really not that pigmented but with
a more honestly with the brush it does
better but I kind of like that it's not
crazy pigmented cuz then I can't really
screw up my contour so I can never I can
never be too heavy-handed with it which
I really like I've traveled with this
one a lot because I know that the color
is perfect in any light for my skin tone
so this is kind of my trusty one that I
think it might have been limited edition
so I don't even know if you can get it
or not but I like it
okay this is the Laura Geller balance
and bronze foundation and bronzer in
fair you guys I don't think I have ever
used this I think maybe once maybe but I
even then I don't even know because I've
got like the balance in Brighton just
this side in a full-size of its own and
that one I used but this I don't because
the bronzer is like a reddish well gosh
it's almost like well no it does look a
little more I don't know it's just not
one that I'm I reach for I don't really
know why I don't reach for I just don't
so even though again this was expensive
I think I'm gonna pass it on because I
just don't use it in the last bronzer
econ Tory saying that I've got is this
Aesthetica cosmetics contour kit which
you guys know that I absolutely adore I
featured it in a review video recently
and if you can catch it on it's on
Groupon sometimes really cheap and on
Amazon it's not too expensive it retails
for like $60 but it's almost always on
sale either on Groupon
look or somewhere for like 20 around 20
or 25 so you can get great deals on this
almost at any point in time and it is
exactly like the Anastasia contour kit
so if you've not been wanting to spend
that much money try this it's amazing
watching my review you'll love it and
this shade right in between is the best
dupe I've found for the Kevin no qualms
one that I told you guys about it is so
I mean they're like dead on there oh my
gosh I just love it so I'm definitely
keeping this little guy right here I use
it all the time I'm so surprised by how
much are you so for a tally this is
everything that I'm keeping in that is
what I'm getting rid of I'm clearly
keeping a lot more than I'm getting rid
of which I had kind of assumed that I
would for me I feel as though everything
that I'm keeping like especially in my
highlights every single one kind of
serves a different purpose for me so I
don't really feel guilty about keeping
those and then bronzer wise I love all
these bronzers and the only one that I'm
not 100% totally in love with is my
hoola but I like it enough that I do use
it especially in the summer and so I'd
rather use that up then get rid of that
because I do like it whereas these
bronzers I'm just never reaching for and
it's hard because again Tarte is
expensive too faces expensive so is
laura geller offer up probably is
although I got it in a subscription box
they're all really good products but I'm
just not in love with them so there's no
point in having them waste space when
someone else could love them so I hope
