drawer but it also had my bronzers and
highlighters in it and you can imagine
it was stuffed to the brim now this is
still a mess this is everything left
over once I took out my highlighters
miron's errs which I have already
decluttered in that video should already
be up so definitely check below for the
link to that video but today now I'm
gonna tackle my blushes and I don't even
know that this is gonna fit in one video
I was hoping it would but this is a lot
so I think what I'm gonna do first is my
mind like cream and liquid blushes and
my palettes and then the next video will
be all of the rest of my powder blushes
which of course I have the most of so
let me go ahead and pull out what I'm
gonna do you want it glimpse at all of
my palettes and my cream blushes I mean
this is a lot and the reality is yes I
know that what I do is you know makeup
related so I know that I'm going to keep
a lot of this but there are a few
products here that I know that either
I'm never going to use or I've used and
hated or whatever or it's just a bad
color for me so let's go ahead and go
through the first thing here this is a
Tarte duo it's the power couple duo
and it's got this blush and this bronzer
I think that this is Park Avenue
princess and this is Dollface why
doesn't it say so I mean these are
beautiful beautiful beautiful bronzers
and blushes I just think they're so
pretty love the packaging definitely
keeping this I actually recently got
this but that makes me realize I have
this Tarte Park Avenue princess one that
I was keeping from my last video that I
did my bronzer and highlight because I
liked it but I don't know how I didn't
realize that I literally already have
this right here so I am gonna go ahead
and get rid of this one
because there's no point in keeping it
so yeah I got rid of another that's
awesome so this got things rolling
around so I'm having to put things in
certain places this is a star
looks trio and it just says 3b to so I
don't know what shade
I think wouldn't pass this on is in a
star box and I don't know I have so many
palettes and this one is nice but I'm
just not using it and I know that I
won't
I'm never reaching for it so I'm gonna
pass it on so someone else can love on
that one this is a seal a convertible
color in peach blossom which is a cream
blush that I love I think it is so
pretty so I'm definitely gonna keep this
one however this one here is in hibiscus
and I just got this off Haute look I
actually dug my nail into it but i've
swatched it and i was like no it's it's
red and for someone with a deeper skin
tone it's gonna be gorgeous
but for my skin tone it looks terrible
hole so even though I'm sad because I
really like the formula of these I'm
gonna go ahead and pass this on this is
an elf contouring blush and bronzer
cream and this I I don't even know that
i've swatched this maybe i've swatched
it it's clearly got some moisture going
on there let's go ahead and swatch it
now oh wow that's pretty i'm so glad i
swatched this blue so keeping this eye
I've got to do a review on this because
I want to see how this wears throughout
the day that's beautiful why have I not
swatch this till now I've been saying
so definitely gonna keep this and get
I'm probably going to review that on my
channel because that looks amazing okay
so moving forward this is the NYX cream
blush in what is it boho chic that I
rave about all the time I talked about
it in my 2014 favorites as well like for
the entire year it's beautiful it's very
similar to the elf one it just gives
this unbelievable finish to your face I
can't even describe it it's so beautiful
okay so these these are expensive these
are the tarte there's the blushing bride
and fearless and I love fearless this is
like again a really pretty peachy tone
and I don't ever apply it this way I
usually use this nipple brush but it's a
really nice light wash of color and
these smell
like lemons almost I don't really know
how to describe that one either I feel
like it's kind of lemon so I'm
definitely keeping this one this one I'm
torn because it's pretty dark this is in
blushing bride it's pretty dark but when
you actually swatch it it's not too dark
it's just pink so it's kind of hit or
miss with this one I think I want to try
it some more and I'm torn because I'm
getting married in June and so I love
that that's called blushing bride I feel
like I should bring that with me on my
honeymoon or something just cuz this
makes me smile so I think I'm gonna keep
it for now
and these honestly you guys these are
pretty amazing I got these in two
different box each arms and I was blown
away so amazing this however this is the
Josie Maran Argan color stick in red
carpet and I love the rose gold
packaging I mean is gorgeous
it's got this little topper you take off
and I love the color I mean isn't that a
pretty kind of neutral color but you
guys it does not go on that way like it
I don't even know how to describe it it
like it doesn't look like that on the
skin and the smell is I don't know how
to describe this smell either
it smells like spices and I love like
patchouli and like spices or whatever
you want to call that scent I don't even
know what to call that scent but this
one is like a bad version of it I can't
handle the smell I don't know why and
some people would probably like it so
for me the colors okay I don't think it
looks like that on the skin but it's
alright but the smell I can't get past
so I'm gonna pass this on to someone
that will love it because I've literally
only swatched it and worn it on my face
once alright moving forward so this is
the Maybelline master glaze it's in
barely pink and I just got this from Big
Lots for like a dollar 50 the other day
and it's just a really pretty kind of
similar to that josie maran one but a
little more shimmery and so I'm
definitely gonna keep this I think this
is so amazing
absolutely comparable to the Tarte ones
but obviously way cheaper
so I'm keeping that this is the only
liquid blush I currently own and every
liquid blush I've had I've had from some
from Sonia Kashuk and those were pretty
good but I just don't find myself using
them because it's just more work to be
honest so I'm I think I've only swatched
this model co1 and so I'm just gonna
pass it on now because I know that I'm
not going to use it this is a Mary Kay
like it's the whole kit and there were a
subscriber sent this to me and there
were some shadows in here but I took
those out to put them with the other
shadows if you've seen my eye shadow
declutter video you saw those but in
here is still the blush this blush is
amazing you guys it's it reminds me of
NARS orgasm absolutely looks just like
that blush and I mean it's just this
pink with peach and like gold shimmer in
it and I want to see if it has the name
shy blush it is so beautiful I will say
I'm not a big fan of this packaging the
idea is that you put your lipstick in
there you maybe have your eyeshadows
like it had and a blush and then you can
shut it and the lipstick stays in there
but for me I just want that blush like I
want that separate so I need to invest
it in in a Z palette I can't believe I
don't have one yet but I need to invest
in as deep out so I can maybe put that
and a few other things in there cuz this
is gorgeous but the packaging is just
really bulky here in this so but I'm
gonna keep that obviously I just need to
deep pot it and by deep pot it I mean
like take it out of the magnet I mean
it's not really defaulting so the next
one is this Tarina Tarantino doll
skinned cheek palette you guys I love
this palette it's beautiful I mean
really truly it's gorgeous its pigmented
it lasts all day but I never ever reach
for this ever and I have to be honest I
just filmed this part and in that part I
decided to keep it but then I thought
about it and I was like I need to refill
this because I should get rid of it I
was trying to keep it because I think
it's pretty and you know a lot of people
talk about it but that was silly because
I'm not ever using it and someone would
love this
so I'm just gonna do it I'm gonna get
rid of it and it's huh it's hard for me
to do but I am going to do it I'm proud
of myself already
good job yes okay so this is the elf
blush palette in light which elf sent to
me a while ago and I'm gonna keep it I
you guys are gonna laugh I've had this
before and I got rid of it and then they
sent it to me and I was I just laughed
when I opened it but I think I am gonna
keep this because these are amazing
matte blushes and it's kind of hard I
don't have a lot of matte blushes in my
collection and to have this many options
I think it's gonna be great you know for
any look I'm trying to do and this is a
palette that's really inexpensive and I
like to talk about really good
inexpensive products on my channel so I
am going to keep it this however in the
realm of elf is okay if you see it I
mean it's pretty good but I'm just again
not really reaching for it and I don't
want to keep things that I'm never
reaching for look at how amazing these
swatches are way too crazy on my skin
the I'm not a big fan of the highlighter
to be honest and then the bronzer is
pretty good but this is crazy on my skin
the bronzer is okay and I don't like to
highlight so I don't want to keep
something that I only want one part of
and I don't necessarily want to deep pot
it because the bronzer is good but I've
got so many I don't need to take this
whole thing apart so this is something
I'm gonna pass on that someone else will
love last thing is oh man this I'm
definitely keeping this is the Tarte
pin-up girl 12-hour blush palette and
it's got five different shades I'm gonna
put this on here so I can tell you the
shades this is breathless embraced
whimsy bashful and irreplaceable I love
this I love these blushes you'll see in
my next video where I do on my powder
blushes I have quite a few of these
separately as well but I love them and
so I do think I mean I know I'm gonna
keep this and I'm just I needed to play
with this more because I haven't had it
for very long and a sweet sweet
subscriber sent this to me and I could
not believe it and actually there's like
little bobby pins that are
cute and vintage that come with this
that I wear all the time they're really
cute with pearls so anyway definitely
keeping this I love this and I'm still
ever thankful for it so for the final
rundown this is what I'm keeping hear
from this side over and this is what I'm
getting rid of honestly I'm pretty proud
because when I was first going through
just kind of glancing through my
palettes and cream blushes I thought oh
my gosh I'm not gonna want to get rid of
like any of these especially the
palettes but I'm very proud of myself
for getting rid of those when I know in
my heart of hearts that I'm not using
them and I'm keeping them because
they're pretty or you know whatever
and again if you keep things for that
reason good for you you know but for me
I've gotta make room for other stuff
I've got things that I'm reviewing all
the time and I can't keep everything or
else it will be insane so I feel pretty
good about what I've gotten rid of if
you love this kind of video and you want
to see more I have a whole series of my
declutter Vivi videos which I will link
below other than that I will catch you
guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
