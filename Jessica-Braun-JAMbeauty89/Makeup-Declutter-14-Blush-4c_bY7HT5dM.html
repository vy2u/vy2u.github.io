beloved blushes so you can see I've
stuffed they were kind of strewn about
in this three level thing but I've kind
of stuffed them all into one other than
the elf ones that couldn't fit so let's
just start from one end and work our way
through this first one actually these
first three are from the balm and this
is the hot mama blush which is this
really pretty just gorgeous blush I mean
it's one of those that I always forget I
have and I forget to use it but it's
this really shimmery peachy color this
next one is an insane blush which is
still from the balm but it's another
line of blushes that supposedly are so
long wearing they stain your skin they
don't truly but they are long wearing
all of their blushes are though this is
more of a deeper color than the other a
little more berry like and then the next
one is down boy from the balm which is
this really pretty pink color that is a
really pretty color
so I don't know I feel like with these I
don't really wear them very often the
down boy one I've had since before I had
a channel so it's like special to me so
that's when I think I'm going to keep
just because you know there are only a
few makeup items that I still have from
before I started a channel a couple
years ago and they're special to me they
mean something to me
and since I know this hasn't gone bad
yet either I think I'm going to keep
this one the insane one I think I'm
gonna pass on even though I just got it
just because it's one that I'm just not
ever wearing it's a pretty color and I
have ones that are similar to this color
first of all and I just don't find
myself ever really reaching for it I
think because I'm so fair it's harder to
work with because it's really pigmented
it's an amazing blush but you just have
to have the right skin tone for it so
I'm gonna get rid of this one and keep
this one hot mama I I'm trying to think
let me glance through I'm gonna wait to
the side on this until I've gone through
all the
used to decide if I already have one
that's similar to this because this is a
beautiful blush but again I don't wear
it all the time however this is one that
I'm thinking back I've traveled with
this one a lot because it's such a
gorgeous blush for going out at night so
that is one so this is a maybe I'm going
to keep in the middle it's a maybe I'm
gonna put it back here actually okay so
this one I just recently got this is the
wet and wild by Fergie one and it's in
the shade brush with destiny and it's
again a really pretty shimmery color but
it's a little bit lighter than the hot
mama which for my skintone is I think
really nice it's just so pretty these
are amazing I only own one because the
other two colors in the line are just
too kind of crazy for my skin tone so I
love this one and I just recently got
this I'm definitely keeping that one
this elf one I also love it I used to
have like six of these and I got rid of
all but this one this one is in candid
coral and again a really light peach
really honestly similar to this but I
love this one and it's the only elf one
I still have left because the other ones
were really nice but again I just wasn't
using them and I felt no need to keep
all of those when I wasn't using them so
I'm definitely gonna keep that one as
well
this one I picked up the other day at
Big Lots for like a dollar fifty it's a
covergirl cheekers and these make me
think of my mom because she always used
to have covergirl blush and I just
remember smelling it and always had that
very specific covergirl smell kind of
like powder like a powdery baby powder
smell almost I don't know how else to
describe it but this color is really
really pretty it's in the shade natural
twinkle and it is just a natural pink
color it's almost hard to see because
it's so natural but it doesn't swatch
very well that's the one thing I've
noticed but these these aren't the most
pigmented blushes but for a really
natural kind of no makeup day you know
where you're obviously still wearing
makeup but you don't want a ton on this
is such a pretty little bit of color and
so I like it for now I want to hold on
to it
it's funny I realizing as I've gone so
far I've kept a ton of drugstore and I
have
gotten rid of you know and I've gotten
rid of one of my high-end the bomb so I
have a feeling I'm trying to be better
about just getting rid of high-end ones
I always keep and I only keep them
because they're a high-end or more
expensive product but I need to be
better about being very honest with
myself even if it was a 25 dollar blush
am I using it if not I've got to get rid
of it so especially when we get down to
this and here where it's a lot more
high-end I'm hoping to get rid of some
just because I've had them for a while
and I'm not using okay
this is a Kevin a Kwan blush and Kevin a
quant products are really expensive and
this I bought though on HauteLook for
way cheaper I want to say this was $15
instead of like 40 or something like
that but this the pink is a lot brighter
when it came in the mail is like whoa
that's a lot brighter than I thought I'm
trying to see the shade shador and it's
a it's the brightest pink I own and I've
wanted a few times and you you know if
you're careful the way you apply it you
can apply it it looks beautiful but I
really like it I just recently got it
and I don't have a shade like this so
I'm definitely gonna keep this one this
is the L'Oreal True Match blush and I
this is the only true match blush I've
tried and no one really talks about
these I really like it the only downside
is the pan like fell out of it when I
first got it I just glued it back in but
I have it in c3 4 which is tender Rose
and again it's just a really natural
pink color clearly I like the natural
pink colors but I just like it I think
it's a really nice light simple color
and you can't really go wrong and it
looks beautiful on my skin tone so if
you have a similar skin tone and you're
looking for a new drugstore blush that
lasts all day I think you'll like this
one
tender rose so this Maybelline one I'm
going to keep you guys I've just started
falling in love with drugstore blushes
all over again a lot of these like this
one this one this one and this one were
all purchased within the past year
because I had started getting a lot of
high-end blushes and while I love them I
realized like what am i doing like I
feel like my collection has no drugstore
blushes and I know they're amazing
drugstore blushes so I kind of made it
my mission this year to go back in and
pick out some blushes that I know I
would like or that I wanted to try
for you guys and for myself so back to
this this is an amazing one it's in the
shade pink rose and again no one really
talks about this people talked about
them when they first came out and then
everyone just didn't talk about it
anymore but I still love this blush it's
got all of these colors mixed together
to be this kind of shimmery rosy pink I
know it's so gorgeous oh my gosh I love
this so much so so much so I'm
definitely keeping that this one this
okay this is a gorgeous blush and I
don't have one like it but I don't ever
reach for it's the brand is Lady Ken
it's a blossom blusher and it's in this
shade Aurora sweet and I got it in a
Mimi box and it's the prettiest light
pink or not pink obviously light peach
but and it's so pigmented but I just
never see myself reaching for it so I'm
gonna pass this on it's so pretty though
but I don't need it
these two are my benefit blushes that I
own I also own the hoola bronzer but
these are the only like blushes I love
these so much you guys and I know that
everyone used to talk about the benefit
box flushes all the time and like oh my
gosh every single one is so amazing well
I was like I doubt it because they're so
expensive and I'm like there's no way I
don't know I was just really skeptical
so I think the first one out of these I
got I think was coralista and I just
fell in love it's this unbelievable
peach that just it I don't know how to
describe these you guys there it's just
they're amazing they smell really good
each of them have like their own smell
now I think you can find blushes that
are just as good at the drugstore but
they are really good so if you've got
like a gift card and you're thinking
about what to buy at maybe Sephora these
really really hard nice coralista is
amazing for any skin tone if you're
really fair like me you would love sugar
bomb this one has these four colors
swirled into it and it just swirls to be
this really pretty peach and kind of
pink as well
but it's just one of those blushes that
looks actually kind of looks similar to
sugar bomb but it's a little wider and
it has a little more shimmer as well and
if you're fair you'll love it if you're
not you might almost have to use this as
a highlight but it's just beautiful oh
my gosh I love them so much
oh telephone oh they smell so good too
these are my two matte blushes I used to
have more but I got rid of some because
I realized again I wasn't using them and
it that was the hardest thing getting
rid of some Mac blushes was very hard
because Mac I'm very very thoughtful
when I buy Mac products because I don't
want to just waste my money and so it
was even harder to get rid of them but I
just realized like the one I got rid of
I have Dame and I also had well dressed
and they're both so similar and so I
just decided you know what I don't need
both so I got rid of one but the other
one I have is full of joy which you guys
know is one of my ultimate favorites
it's this unbelievable like almost
purplish light pink and it looks so
unbelievable and frosty on every skin
tone whether you're crazy fair like I am
or you're super dark
it just looks unbelievable if you're
gonna buy one Mac blush I would
recommend full of joy I also love Dame
it's just a really simple everyday matte
color it's beautiful especially for that
everyday if you're looking for a blush
just to wear to work everyday and you
don't want to go crazy this is an
amazing one it it always looks perfect
okay this is where I'm torn
everyone loves Tarte blushes including
me but if you saw the video before that
might declutter video before this I went
through my cream blushes in my palettes
I have this entire palette right here of
Tarte blushes so I'm thinking I need to
get rid of some of these because I again
I used to have more and I've gotten rid
of a lot but to have all of these in
addition to this is silly so I know that
I'm keeping this this is exposed this is
buff and this is blushing bride which I
love the blushing bride I have the cream
version of this which I did keep because
I love it exposed
I'm gonna keep because again it's one
that I don't really have one like this
it's kind of pinky but it's kind of
bronzy it's a really cool color and I
know a lot of people talk about it but
it is honestly an amazing color so I'm
gonna keep that now these I feel like
this one I've literally swatched once I
got it on HauteLook for like 10 bucks
it's more of a bronzey shade but I
haven't but it's got a little shimmer to
it and I haven't used it even once yeah
it's more of a bronzer shade I'm just
gonna pass it on this one it's so
beautiful but again it's so dark for my
skin tone look at that I know I've got
like a thousand swatches it's really
dark for my skin tone and you can apply
it so that it doesn't look dark a
stipple brush is in my opinion the best
way to apply these because they're so
pigmented but I don't feel the need to
keep it when I've got this color here
what is the name of this one that one is
called no Sam dinner hi okay I have this
one called embraced which is very very
similar to this if not a little bit
lighter so I'm gonna pass on blushing
bride while it's still pretty new so
someone else can enjoy and love this
that makes me sad okay but I got too
many next up are my ELF blushes I just
recently posted on my Instagram well
actually it was a while ago now a
picture of all five of these and just
looking at them even in the picture I
was like man every single one of these
is so pretty but the reality is that I
haven't picked up any of these in a very
long time now I know there's some I'm
gonna keep because I want I'm planning
on reviewing for my channel here so the
one that's the cream blushes is it's st.
Lucia and these creams I just watched
them the other day and they are like
literally unbelievable so I'm definitely
going to keep the cream version and I'm
just gonna show you guys these are
unbelievable they're crazy like smooth
do it there I mean come on
especially this blush again obviously
you should apply this in my opinion with
the stipple brush these are so cool so
cool so I'm definitely going to keep
this one and I'm planning I need to like
actually use it and determine how I feel
about it
the next one here is Turks Caicos and
it's got a very deep bronzer and then a
really really light like almost
highlight color and this is one that I
don't foresee myself using obviously
that bronzer would never work in a
thousand years for me and then this one
is just so I just can't decide how I
feel about this so I think I'm gonna
pass this one on while it's still new
because someone else will absolutely
adore this and I'm not giving it really
any love this next one is Fiji and this
is oh this is the matte version do I
have the other one as well I think I do
let me see no I don't so this is Fiji
and I don't know if there's another like
a shimmery version of Fiji as well or if
Fiji is just known to be matte but this
is the matte duo that they have and from
what I've heard it's almost always sold
out
I don't know but regardless it's awesome
especially the bronzer because like if
you're looking for a bronzer or maybe
even a contour powder it you know you
know it's a little orange to be a
contour powder but they're matte and
that is hard to find so far I think this
is the only matte version elf has so I'm
gonna keep that for that reason because
I would like to review this as well
especially if it starts coming back in
stock which I'm sure it will the last
two I've got this one is Saint Lucia I
finally know how to say that and then
this one is Antigua guys they're so
pretty are they not absolutely gorgeous
I'm so torn because I love this duo
right here it's this beautiful bright
pink and then this deeper bronze and
then this one is just like the NARS duo
that's really popular so for that reason
alone I want to
this this one I want to keep because I
love this pink so I you know I don't
have to make excuses I'm pretty sure
when you keep both knees cuz they're
just so pretty
and I want to use them more so now I've
got to make the decision about the hot
mama blush did I find one that was
similar to it those are light
I really didn't so I think I'm gonna
keep these but I'm gonna take one out
and replace it I'm gonna take this one
out because even though I love it and
it's so beautiful I don't need another
one that's like this like a shimmery
pink whereas this shimmery like oopsie
oh good it didn't break I love it but at
the same time I've got so many in this
one I'm willing to give up to be able to
keep this one so trade there okay so for
an overview these are the things that
I'm keeping here and this is what I'm
getting rid of and I'm actually pretty
proud I know
blushes are something that I love and I
know that I kind of have decluttered
this a lot before I'd even done this
video I mean like months ago I don't
always film when I get rid of something
but I do get rid of things from time to
time just because like you know
sometimes my sit one of my sisters will
be in town and I'll just kind of go
through and see if there's anything I
don't want that I know she would love
you know what I mean cuz I see you're
like once a year
so just random times that I will just
get rid of things but other than that
this during this official declutter I'm
proud that I got rid of those Tarte
blushes because that's hard when they're
expensive and even though like this one
I got a really good deal on it's so hard
and the balm one same thing because
they're expensive to start with but they
were just taking up room in my
collection and they weren't being used
at all the only one that I was on the
fence about is this Maybelline one cuz
it's amazing but I'm not I just it's one
of those things that even though I like
it a lot I know that I'm not gonna miss
it like I'm not in a month I'm not gonna
think to myself oh man I wish I still
had that Maybelline master highlight
blush so I think that's one thing you
can ask yourself when you're
decluttering anything is in a month live
and remember that I had it or in a month
will I think I should have gotten rid of
that I want that right in this moment
that's not a blush that I would think
about in that way whereas if I what's
one well most of these I would think
that the
like especially sugar bomb I would say
oh my gosh a month from now I'd say man
where's that sugar bomb or full of joy
I'd feel the same way so you know that's
a great question I think to ask yourself
when you're in that situation if you're
interested in more declutter videos I
have so many up so if you're interested
in seeing all the rest of my collection
and all my other declutter is where I
was a little more successful at getting
rid of more check below I can link the
entire playlist and I can also link the
very first video where I start it and I
kind of show you how I organize my stuff
in my Alex drawers just so you can get
an idea and you can start from the
beginning how exciting
so hopefully you enjoyed that and if you
did please subscribe and I'll catch you
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
