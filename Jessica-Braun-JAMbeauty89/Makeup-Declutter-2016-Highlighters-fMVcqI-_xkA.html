we're gonna declutter today and I just
declutter doll my blush and I literally
got rid of I had well I must have had 25
so I got rid of 15 and kept 10 so I feel
like I'm getting rid of a lot and really
only keeping the stuff that I know I
love so we're gonna do the same to this
so I'm gonna spread them out so you can
see them all and we'll go through them
so these are all of my highlighters
again I've gone through a lot of my
makeup and curated my collection time
and time again not necessarily filming
it this is what I have currently we've
got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 highlighters and of course some
of them have multiple colors in it so
let's go ahead and get started
this is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in opal and I used to think
this would be too dark for my skin tone
but it actually looks perfect so if you
don't know what this is oh my gosh it's
just this gorgeous liquid highlighter
now I'm not big on liquid highlighters
but this one what I usually do is I just
put it all over my hand just like this
and then I take a stippling brush or a
small brush and stipple it into it and
then put it on my cheeks that way
because I realized when I've tried to
just stick it on my face it ends up
being everywhere there's way too much
etc so this is one that I actually do
use I've used a good amount of this so
I'm going to keep it for sure this one I
literally just got so I haven't even
swatch it this is from bashas there's
Tsubaki
lotion and scent luminizing moisturizer
so I don't know maybe this shouldn't
even be I feel like this is more like
the Mac strobe cream because I think
it's supposed to be a lotion but it's
just gotten illuminated wow it's very
luminous though let me try and rub it in
some more it actually does look nice but
I feel like this shouldn't be in this
drawer it's not I just assumed it was a
highlighter but it's really not it's a
lotion I think I'm going to keep that
bright this is one of my favorites I've
repurchased this before this is the wet
and wild color
Khanh in reserve your Cabana it's just
the perfect simple subtle highlight and
I love it and I clearly have used it
enough to rebuy it so this one I did
like but I just haven't reached for it
much I think it's just time to get rid
of it it's the wet and wild illuminating
palette and catwalk pink I recently did
a best-of wet-and-wild video I can link
below if you're curious because I'm
pretty sure talk about this it really is
good but I just don't have a use for it
because I've got too many highlighters
and I just don't use it but it does have
like kind of a pink tint to it which is
kind of pretty so you could use it like
as a blush topper as well but I'm gonna
get rid of that one this hourglass
strobing one this is euphoric strobe
light they actually sent me a couple of
these I know I got rid of I think they
sent me too and I got rid of the other
one this one I ended up keeping it
really is a cool highlighter because
it's kind of a neutral tone but it has a
just not really glitter it's just a ton
of shimmer I guess it does have glitter
but it doesn't look glittery on the
cheeks I don't really know how to
describe that and I just love the
formula of these this is the hourglass
luminous light another one that I think
is just so pretty now this one really is
a little bit more peachy toned which I
like for everyday because I think it you
can barely see it it's just so subtle
and I think that's perfect for what I
like so I think I am going to keep both
of those this is ridiculous this was
sent to me from a subscriber this is
from Vasanti if I'm saying that right
and it's in it's there see the light duo
and golden child and this formula really
is amazing I mean look at that oh my
gosh I'm trying to like swatch it in a
good place but it's just a very
beautiful I guess watch it all day
highlighter and of course you can get
just the lighter color or just the
golden color but I think together it's
even prettier I can see this video is
gonna be hard because I literally like
almost all of these so like love them so
this is not gonna be like my blush one I
love blush but I I knew which ones I
loved this is gonna be hard because I
really love a lot of these I think I'm
gonna keep this one as well this cougar
one I just got in I think a boxycharm it
a lot of you guys in the comment
said oh my gosh you will be so surprised
it's actually amazing so it's a loose
powder highlight and it is more yellow
but when you blend it out it really is
so subtle and beautiful if you haven't
caught on I do like the more subtle
highlighters and this one did not
disappoint you guys were so right it is
amazing so I'm keeping that one as well
these two I think I'm just gonna get rid
of I bought them I don't even think I
mentioned I'm in a video I might have
mentioned them in a hall this is a gold
one and it didn't swatch perfectly and
then this one was more this one was more
pink and again I just I just wasn't
impressed it was kind of nothing so I'm
gonna get rid of these as well with some
of these I might go through an any that
I see are just like genuinely these
really just aren't good quality I might
save in a drawer for like my products I
regret buying type video but then get
rid of after so they're officially
decluttered for my collection
this Becca one I just bought it's their
classic one in can you guess the color
opal again it's just so pretty I bought
it while we were in Disney and it's this
is not a subtle highlight but I think it
is just so gorgeous and beautiful so I'm
definitely keeping it hard candy one and
tiki is one of my all-time faves it is
more of a golden one and I just find it
to be so pretty and a lot of people have
found that they love it as well I think
there are some duds like I bought I
swear one of these before and it was
really chalky but this one's really
buttery so I think it hopefully if you
bought it you haven't gotten a dud one
this is the Mac skin finish in soft and
gentle and I've had this for a while to
be honest this one is beautiful though
it looks a lot like opal like a lot like
it makes me feel like maybe I don't need
both of these I mean truly do I really
need both let me swatch them side by
side so they are very similar this one
is Becca's opal and that one is Mac soft
and gentle there's a slight difference
but I don't think the difference is
enough to keep both so I think I am
going to get rid of the Mac one so I'm
gonna keep the Bekaa get rid of the Mac
whoa all right Jess
let's go love my hourglass trio my
ambient lighting trio I love these two
shades more than anything I just
honestly like especially this one I need
this one in a single that one by the way
is dim white it's just it's the perfect
kind of beige colored very simple powder
but I love this I'm certainly not
getting rid of but I really do use it
like a couple times a week every week
this bare mineral one I'm gonna get rid
of I think it broke me out and also it
was kind of just like nothing
it's a translucent powder duo and it
said this is Matt and this is glow so
this is just a matte translucent powder
which I'm just not a big fan of white
translucent powders anyway and then this
is supposed to be glow and it just
wasn't it didn't do a lot and on top of
that I just felt like a lot of bare
minerals products that are in powder
form break me out and I wish that
weren't the case but it is so they
actually so as disappointed as I was I
think I am gonna get rid of this this is
the elf illuminating palette this one
really is nice I've talked about this
one being kind of a dupe for the
hourglass one just because there's a lot
of similarities there's this beige shade
which is pretty darn similar to this one
and then there's the kind of more bronze
ìshe which is pretty similar to that
one and then there's the glowy shade
which I would say is similar to this one
and then of course the elf has that
extra white one but I mean they're so
close these are really pigmented the elf
one so this is I think I am going to
keep it do I really need both no but I
love them both and I don't think there's
any reason why I can't keep both since I
like to use them
now this este edit flash illuminator is
I think just too dark I mean what do you
guys it gets pretty dark so I think I'm
going to get rid of that one so that's
someone with maybe a more correct skin
tone for it can use it and it looked
amazing
so that's what I'm gonna get rid of and
then this Mac these Mac lustre drops I
really like it's in pink rebel again
subscribe that same subscriber sent a
lot of these things to me it's just such
a pretty of course now I've got
highlight all over my hand anyway but
it's just such a pretty glowy product
it's kind of subtle as a highlight if
you use it alone you can also mix it
with things but I have loved playing
with that on how can I forget I forgot
this I accidentally put with my blushes
before and I had to pull it out this is
this pur cosmetics moonlight glow strobe
and highlight palette I love the
packaging of this I think it's so pretty
and it's just like kind of a cream to
powder type highlight so they look
pretty subtle I haven't even just watch
that let this last one here I don't know
they really are pretty they're not again
they're a little more subtle than a lot
but will I use it why haven't I really
used it yet you know what I mean I think
I probably won't I think I'm gonna get
rid of it it's really pretty but if I'm
not gonna use it why am i holding on to
it so these are all the things I'm
getting rid of up here and these are all
the things I'm keeping now I did keep
more that I got rid of this time but I
really wasn't surprised with that
because I know how much I love
highlighters and so it's just hard when
you love them and you know you use them
there's not really a point in getting
rid of them and a lot of them are
different and I'm really glad like I
really didn't think I was gonna get rid
of these two so I'm glad that I did same
with these because like the essay edit
one is expensive and the bareMinerals
one is expensive but they're just not
right for me for one reason or another
so I've just got to let them go I feel
like a lot of times I hold onto products
and like I like the way they look in the
drawer but for me it just I don't need
to do that I don't need that
so I'm happy with this next up will be
bronzers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
