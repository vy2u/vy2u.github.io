mascaras and then also my brow products
and this is kind of an odd combination I
know but I didn't have a ton of mascaras
now I didn't have a ton of brow so it
worked out really well so I'm gonna kind
of go through and organize these here in
a second and then we'll go through them
okay so I've got them organized these
are mascaras these are brow gels brow
pencils brow tools just kind of
miscellaneous brow stuff and then my
sharpener so let's start with my brow
pencils so this is the brow pencil I use
every single day no matter what so
anasazi brow is and then this is a
backup because this one's just about
gone so also one tip that I learned the
brow is like writing wears off really
really easily so if you put clear nail
polish on it it won't wear off now the
first time I did it on this one it did
not work because I put way too much I
kept rubbing it with the clear nail
polish and like with the brush and it
kind of smeared it so on the new one
I've already done it where I just one
coat of clear polish all around it and
it worked perfectly so it's dried and
back in the box for now so I'm obviously
gonna keep both of these this Ofra or
Ofra eyebrow Universal I'm never gonna
use it's too like the idea is that you
can push really hard and get a really
dark line and then medium and light but
I'm just never gonna use it so I'm gonna
go ahead and pass that on now before I
even mess with it anymore so this these
are my brow gels this is the one I'm
using right now it's the NYX control
freak one and I love it and I use it
every single day so I'm definitely gonna
keep that these two this is an essence
one and this is a billion-dollar brow
gel this one doesn't hold very well I
use most of it up to be honest with you
but I find that it just doesn't hold
very well so I'm gonna go ahead and pass
that one on and then this essence lash
and brow gel is pretty good to be honest
but now that I found another drugstore
equivalent that are around the same
price and this one's way better I don't
love the essence one as much now it is
still like I said it is still really
good and it's a good option and I think
it's better than like the Maybelline
clear great lash one or whatever that is
this is way better than that but it's
not my favorite so I'm gonna pass that
when I say pass on obviously these two
I'm just gonna throw away because
they're used and kind of gross okay so
the next one is this honest Asya one
I've had a full-size of this a couple
trial size and I love these this one has
just a little bit left in it so I'm
going to keep it because I want to just
finish using it up but it's amazing it's
a lot more expensive but it really is
amazing so back here I've got my AA
Nastasia powder and this I've clearly
used like crazy it's one of those duos
and it's in medium brown and I used to
use this all the time now I still use it
and if I were to run out of my Anastasia
brow Wiz I would go right back to using
this because it is amazing and I think
what's amazing about it is not
necessarily the like consistency or
formula it's just that the shades are so
perfect so they don't for me I don't
want my brows to look like to kind of
pull red and that was what I was finding
with a lot of the products I used so
this is like the first product I found
that did not pull red and I loved it so
loved that definitely keeping that this
is the benefit gimme brow and it's in
you know the lighter brown shade
I love how tiny the spoolie is but my
eyebrows look a mess when I use this
like it gets all over the skin around it
no matter how careful I am and so I
think I've discovered that for me just
tinted brow products just don't work so
I'm gonna give rid of this even though
it's expensive because I just don't ever
ever use it this is a Milani brow and
eye highlighter and the idea behind it
is that you know you can use this on
your brows and this on your like brow
bone etc now this for the highlight is
okay it's a little yellow for my skin
tone and then this for the brows it's
again okay I don't know I might keep it
for now I've heard of people using this
to contour their nose and stuff or just
as like a cream contour so I might try
it for that because the color for
contouring is I mean that's perfect for
my skin tone because I can I can blend
it out and make it look really nice so I
think I might keep it and try it for
that purpose I don't
think I'll get much use out of the
highlight portion but that part I think
I would so I am gonna keep it for that
reason alone
these sharpeners I just don't I mean I
obviously use them but I don't love
either one of them so what I need to do
is invest in and hardly invest but I
think I might just buy a new one and get
rid of both of these for now I'm see
this one just the lid falls off I got it
in like a Mimi box
this one's just really old and both the
top and the bottom come off and only one
of them is supposed to come off so it's
just really old so I think for now I'll
keep this one just because it's got both
sizes that I might need but I'm gonna
just probably this week go to the store
buy a new one and just throw these out
because they're really old they're kind
of crusty and I would just like a fresh
one so these brow owls I these are my
tweezer 'men tweezers that I use like
crazy that I absolutely adore these I
don't ever use so I'm just gonna get rid
of them
and then these are the browsers that I
use all the time so definitely keeping
those that's scare so I'm really good
about only opening a few at a time
however somehow I ended up with a few
open right now and it's making me crazy
so this is the one that I use every
single day
my voluminous original I buy backups of
this I use the backups I actually I
don't think I have any backups of this
right now but I just opened this one a
few weeks ago and it's one of my
favorites so that one I'm definitely
keeping this one I've only opened once
just to look at the brush and it's
really nice but I think I'm gonna pass
it on because it's brand new I literally
opened it like last week but I just
don't I don't know I just don't need any
more right now and it's already open I
feel like it'll dry out before I would
ever get to use this I'm gonna pass it
on to someone now that can use it right
now so that's on okay this is the M
Michelle Phan it's just in black and
it's their lash gallery waterproof and I
like the brush I used it once or twice
and I didn't totally love it but it's
still brand new and I want to try it
because honestly I don't own any M
products this one came in an Ipsy bag
I'm sure since Michelle Phan works for
mc2 or whatever anyway so I want to try
it out and see if I like it at all and
if you guys have any
and products that you really like let me
know down below because I would love to
try them and support you know people
that also do what I do but I don't
really know where to start because I
haven't heard all the best things so if
you have a mem product you love let me
know down below cuz I'm curious to try
some more but I'm gonna continue using
this and try it out
this one is unopen and it's one that i
used to love that i kind of forgot about
and I watched that as rad she was I
think doing one of her declutter video
she calls gue hoarding and she mentioned
how much she loves this and I was like
oh yeah I forgot about how amazing that
was and I haven't bought it in a while
so this will kind of be my next one I
use after I run out of my voluminous so
keeping this cuz it's unopened and I
just bought it this is a Terina
tarantino one and i'm so sad it's not
that good the packaging is real hefty
and really nice the brush is nice and
big which I like but it doesn't hold a
curl like at all so these two right here
are open and recently open and I need to
like try them out and make sure that
they're no good and once I've tried them
out this week I am going to I think what
I'll do is like solely wear these and
not even wear my voluminous at all just
so I can really get a feel for if I like
them if I don't I'm just gonna pass them
on okay this is a this is the Urban
Decay perversion mascara and I haven't
opened it haven't tried it but it is one
that I've been wanting to so I'm gonna
keep it and try it here in a bit I think
I might just pass this one on while it's
new it's a Milani one I don't remember
what it came in I I think it might have
been a from Ipsy like when you refer
friends and you can spend your points on
things I think I spent some points on
this but I just don't really have a
desire to try it so I think I'm just
gonna pass it on while it's brand new so
out of all of them these are the
products that I'm getting rid of and
these are what I'm keeping now the
reality is this is almost gone and these
two will eventually be gone soon so it's
almost as if I'm just keeping those and
this will be gone soon too
so I think I did a pretty good job it
was hard one of my struggles for this
one was getting rid of the benefit gimme
brow because benefit products are
expensive I think this was like $20
and so it's hard for me to say goodbye
to high-end or at least more expensive
products especially when they're pretty
much brand-new and a lot of people love
it and a lot of people talk about it
those are the things that make me want
to keep it but I know that there if I'm
not using it there's no point in having
it sit in my collection and take up
space and stress me out so so I'm pretty
proud it's not great but it's not
terrible so it's a start and I'm feeling
better already so if you're interested
in watching any of my other declutter
videos or if you want to watch it from
the very beginning I will link the very
first video below where I kind of show
how I organize my entire makeup
collection and just get started and
start at the beginning and work your way
through I think you'll enjoy it
one of my favorites to film so far has
been my lipstick one cuz I got rid of
like half of my collection I'm really
proud of that and that was a really good
feeling so definitely check it out and
subscribe if you're interested and I'll
catch you guys in the next one bye
it was $49 and it would originally have
been $49 just for the palate but it came
with a bunch of other stuff so it is the
Too Faced better than chocolate kit here
and like I said it was $49 but look at
all that it comes with
it comes with the chocolate bar palette
here which is $49 on the sells it also
comes with the better than sex mascara
which is unbelievable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
