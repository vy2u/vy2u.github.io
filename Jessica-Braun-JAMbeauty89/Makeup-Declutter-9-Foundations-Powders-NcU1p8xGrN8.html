foundations and powders I think we're
gonna try and get through both in one
video this one might be a little bit
longer this I have clearly outgrown
these are usually in my Alex Shores I've
outgrown this little container which I
don't remember where I got this probably
t.j.maxx but it's pretty great as long
as you have a drawer that is tall enough
to handle it or if you just left this on
your tabletop or vanity whatever and
these I just got at the dollar store and
they connect to other ones of different
sizes which is pretty cool so let's go
ahead and divert it and we'll start with
the foundations and if you just saw eye
shadows on my arms and hands that was
because I was just decluttering my
palettes as well so yeah okay so the
first thing I'm seeing a lot of these
are new to me these are the L'Oreal
infallible ones which are awesome
however I've got two shades and I don't
need two shades I bought this and it's
just too dark it's 103 I it's I just got
it I still have the receipt so I might
try and return that and just keep the
one that is at least closer to my skin
tone which is 102 shell beige so far I
really like these I mean these are like
amazing they're so expensive for
drugstore though they're like twelve
bucks but so I'm gonna keep the lighter
and I'm gonna get rid of slash try and
return the other one cuz I've only used
it like twice and usually they're pretty
good about that okay this is another new
one that I have been trying out that I
like and it's the perfect shade for me I
got it in 112 and it's that fit me matte
and poreless foundation and I oh my gosh
I really like this too this is a little
bit lighter which I just like so
definitely gonna keep that okay where
don't go this I haven't even tried yet
well by the time I'm putting this up I
might have tried it but at this point in
filming I haven't tried its the BB cream
matte version now I've tried the Rimmel
BB cream like original and for me it did
not work for my skin and I couldn't find
one light enough this is in light and I
still feel like I've kind of swatched it
and it looks way too dark still for my
skin tone but I'm gonna give it a try
I'm just so pale so definitely keeping
another new one from Rimmel the 25 hour
nation keeping because I've got to
review it and I'm excited to review it
alright this one this is the Kevin o
Quan I don't even know what I got in the
shade s Bo - that's all I know I have no
idea what product it is I bought it when
hautelook had a Kevin a Kwan sale and
it's interesting because you take off
this part and you just like squeeze it
out but and it might do it now it
squeezes out like oil and stuff it's
terrible let me see if it even works oh
this time it worked of course see now
it's working and it looks really nice
man I was gonna get rid of it I don't
know I just feel like it's either old or
I don't know like should I keep it this
is gonna be a maybe I'm gonna start a
maybe pile this is going there so maybe
it's probably a bad idea but I'm gonna
do it anyway
alright the next thing what and wild
cover all I have two of these and I got
two of these because I fell in love with
the formula which this is what I had
originally had and it's almost gone so
that I went and I found out that they
had a much lighter shade so I bought
that so I think I might go ahead and get
rid of the darker one cuz it's way too
dark and keep the lighter one and plus
the lighter ones a lot fuller so it
solved that problem this is the L'Oreal
magic Lumi and I don't know like I feel
like it's just I keep wanting to like it
because the packaging is cute there's a
pump and I love the idea of it but every
time I've ever used it I've never liked
the way my skin looks and you know I've
only used it down to there so it's so I
mean honestly pretty full what shade is
this in this is in w12 I cannot find my
right shade in this this is a little too
dark but the other ones I've tried are
just not right like I just can't find my
right shade in this so I think I'm just
gonna have to pass it on even though I'm
sad because it's such a pretty packaging
this is the L'Oreal True Match in W 3
way
to dark what I was thinking I know not
because this is way too dark you can
just see like what how did this happen
and I just recently got it I don't know
like I think when I went there I was
like well when I first bought it which
was actually really I think closer to
summer I was like well I'm a little
darker than I was
so I'll get one that's darker that way
you know I'll have a foundation for when
I'm darker but I know absolutely not so
I'm just going to pass it on which
stinks because I literally have only
used it like twice I'm a moron I don't
know what's wrong with me this is my
graph on Colorstay which I love but it's
gotten kind of wonky do I see that it's
like gray and I wear 150 buff but it's I
don't know it's almost gone and I
haven't been using it lately I've been
using my whipped so I think I'm just
gonna get rid of this now and I
eventually will repurchase it because I
always do because I do love it and what
do I get do I get the normal - yeah I
get the normal to dry so it's not to
drying on my skin it adds a little bit
of moisture but I'm gonna go ahead and
get rid of this cuz it's getting kind of
old and I'll eventually buy a new one
but not probably not anytime soon
because I've got a lot to work bye-bye
this is the jouer luminaid luminizing
moisture tint and I bought this on
Birchbox because there was like some
sort of free gift with purchase it was
like a full size.you a lip gloss or
something so they hope Birchbox always
says awesome deals when you're buying
like something high-end full-size from
them so that's where I always go before
I buy something full price because they
always have really good deals like that
so this I thought I watched some
tutorials and people were like oh my
gosh like this is amazing it looks good
on its own it just adds the right amount
of luminizing like it just has this
luminous look to it and then I put it on
my skin and laughed out loud because I
looked like a clown like it was the
shiniest craziest I can't even describe
it so what I do with it is I mix it with
other foundations and that looks
beautiful but on its own at least on me
it looks ridiculous I wish it looked
good but it looks ridiculous I have in
the shade pearl by the way
so I'm going to keep that one if I
didn't say that but I do have to mix
that one this is the Revlon age-defying
foundation love that it has a pump I use
this like non-stop for like months
they're in the fall and I do like it
it's got an SPF of 15 so it's not super
high SPF but usually my moisturizer has
an SPF anyway so so I am gonna keep this
and it's a nice shade on me it's a
little deeper but not so deep so
honestly it just kind of makes my face
look alive but it still kind of matches
with my neck so it's no biggie so gonna
keep that one this one I don't get what
all the fuss is about with this one
because I not that I mean it's got
really high coverage and I love that
it's got a pump etc I have in the shade
805 but on its own like I don't know it
just it makes my skin look kind of bla
like and it could just be my skin type
but it makes my skin look kind of dry
and it looks really made-up even what I
do it with a Beauty Blender so I'm gonna
keep it because this is awesome when I
do mix it with that UA one but other
than that like I just can't use it on
its own I think it's just my skin type
it must be because everyone else in the
universe seems to love it but so I'm
gonna keep that one so this is the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
this one I I don't know I haven't
decided how I feel about this one this
one I bought at Sephora when it was like
20% off or something the shade works for
me I have the shade well I have no idea
does it not say on here oh my gosh it oh
there it is fair light honey that works
for me I thought I'd be a little deep
but once you blend it out but I can't
figure out how to apply this so it looks
as well as it does on other people
because with a brush I don't quite like
it I do not like this with a Beauty
Blender it's like something it's just a
thicker formula so it just doesn't work
so I think I'm gonna try it with my
hands and see this one when it's
wintertime I can't wear it it's too
drying but I haven't had it in the
summer so I'm gonna keep it and see how
my skin does with it in the summer
because that might be great for like if
you're not wanting your makeup to sweat
off but right now it's just not working
but I don't want to get rid of it yet
because I I just haven't given it the
full year treatment so
keep it and try it out then the elf BB
cream hmm honest thing you guys I've
only tried this once I should try this
and review it I see that's the problem I
have so many that I don't even like I
didn't even remember I had this so I am
gonna try this out
I want to see if it's the right shade I
love that it's got a pile did that get
on the lens I that just squirted it
everywhere it looks a little deep mmm it
looks a little pink on my skintone but
what I like is that it feels like it
kind of mattifies which for a BB cream
is rare like I feel like every BB cream
I've tried has been so oily that it just
looks terrible so sorry I gotta wipe it
off so what shade is this I have it in
fair okay that makes sense so it seems
to be a good match it just looks a
little pink but other than that I need
to try this out so I'm going to keep it
and try it out if I don't like it I'll
pass it on okay so the next thing is my
Estee Lauder Double Wear this I got at a
cosmetics company outlet which you can
find it like outlet malls if you have
one year you can look it up and they
sell Estee Lauder and Mac and Clinique
and anything in the Estee Lauder family
of brands for a pretty deep discount I
mean it's still not like drugstore
prices but it's a lot more affordable so
that's what I bought this i think this
retails for what is it like around $40 I
got it for like 25 so it's a lot more
affordable not that it's cheap but I
wanted to try it because it's like
everyone's Holy Grail and I got it in
the shade 1c one shelf 15 and the shade
seems to work pretty well the pump I
actually bought it's a Mac pump and you
can just like cut the straw down to size
so cuz otherwise the straw goes a little
bit longer so you just cut it to size
and it fits perfectly on the top like
absolutely perfectly so that's what I
did and I think a subscriber one of you
guys had told me about that so I don't
use it very often though and I don't
really know why so I need to try it out
more I just I feel like it's so high
coverage that on a day to day basis I
just don't need that much coverage so I
need to try it out and see and I need to
use this more often
when it's a special occasion cuz it is
like a really I mean a crazy nice
foundation this is my beloved Revlon
Colorstay whipped the one that I go so
back and forth from now I hate that it's
in a jar because it's so unsanitary and
it you know the active in green it is
just not good for the ingredients it's
just a bad bad packaging idea but I love
it I just wish they would do it in a
different packaging that's all but I do
love it again I wear 150 buff and if you
have not tried this it's so I feel like
it's so good for all skin types because
it's not super drawing that it's not
really moisturizing either it's just
right in between like a satin and I
think it is gorgeous so continuing on
like I said this is gonna be a long
video sorry guys this is the elf
foundation which is to be compared to
the bare minerals original foundation
this bare minerals foundation foundation
is in light and it is so flippin dark
like it literally looks like I mean it's
insane here let me just it is so dark do
you guys see how like orange is dark
that is it's not really showing up as
well but it's so dark on me like
comically dark so I've got to get rid of
it and I'm so sad because again this
isn't cheap but if I'm not using it
there's no point in holding on to it for
no reason I mean literally I can't use
it maybe in the summer time but then I'm
wanting to use other things so I'm just
gonna get rid of it and I'm really sad
too but it's just time the elf
foundation however I really like and
this is in the shade porcelain I had
gotten this in light and it was way
again way too dark so for me I realized
porcelain is the way to go and I gave
the light one - I think my mom so loved
it really good really comparable to the
bare minerals I really feel like it's
pretty close so definitely recommend and
I love that shade porcelain this is the
elf HD powder in yellow this is the
corrective yellow one and I don't
usually use it in this I usually dupatta
it in a smaller thing because I use it
to set my under eye but I don't I don't
use this all over my face that's for
sure but I keep this so I can refill the
smaller one again
this is great if you've been wanting to
get that Ben Nye banana powder this is
very very similar I don't think the Ben
Nye one is expensive though I haven't
looked into it so I don't know that
there's really that big of a price
difference anyway but this is great if
you're placing in alcohol I think you
would like this as I think more about it
I think I am just gonna get rid of this
Kevin o Quan one I'm looking at it and
every time I've made myself use this I
haven't loved it so even though it's a
crazy expensive nice brand again I
shouldn't keep it until it goes bad for
no reason and plus it's just kind of
wonky so I'm just gonna pass it on
moving on to powders this is my NYX
state matte but not flat powder
foundation it's a little dark for me but
it kind of looks nice when I'm trying to
just bronze up my skin without actually
using a bronzer it's a lot more natural
of a bronzer and it's in the shade nude
I love this powder foundation it is
amazing but I don't really use it ever
anymore and plus it's virtually gone so
I'm just gonna pass it on now it's just
taking up space and I'm never using it
this is the Laura Geller
what is it the balanced and brightened
foundation in fair and I again I got it
on HauteLook
and it's hmm it's a nice powder
foundation but I never find myself using
it because I just don't really use
powder foundation but when you're trying
to brighten up like your the area's
you'd want to highlight without actually
using a highlight this is really nice so
I do use it for that purpose so I'm
gonna hold on to it for now
this Palladio rice paper this is so cool
this was like one of the first things
Palladio is no let me rephrase Palladio
was the first company to ever send me
makeup just for free just to try and so
I'll always have a soft spot in my heart
for them and I've gotten rid of since
then a lot of the products just because
I wasn't using them or I didn't like
them but some of them I did keep and
this is one that I really like they're
rice paper and it's really one that
they're well-known for and what I like
about it they're oil blotting sheets but
they have some of their rice powder
infused in them so it kind of mattifies
and add powder at the same time so I
really like it it's a very inexpensive
and I can find it at Ulta also of course
online this is oh yes definitely keeping
this this is the what does it mineralize
skinfinish and natural I use it all the
time I mean all the time it's my go-to
powder right now so again got it for a
lot cheaper at a CCO alright so these
these puppies I like out of my Rimmel
stay matte you guys know this is like
one of my holy grail favorite powders of
all time I've got the transparent and
then sandstorm sandstorm would be way
too dark for me but again it just kind
of naturally bronzes up my face in a
really nice way so I ended up using this
all the time to set my foundation and
the transparent I don't use very often
but they're not gone yet and they will
be soon so I feel like I should just use
them up and call it a day because I use
these all the time this is a newer one
of my NYX a matte but not flat powder
foundations and it's in a lighter shade
to match my skin more so I'm going to
keep that elf
oh yes the elf tone correcting powder
this is one of those like we mix the
shades together and it supposedly will
be a really good look I don't like it's
gonna correct your tones it is a very
very white powder that for me works I
don't know if it would work for everyone
it kind of works as a matte highlight as
well I think so I'm going to keep it
because you guys know I do elf reviews
all the time because I want to be able
to tell you about products like these
that are pretty good so I'm gonna hold
onto that this however is the Palladio
dual wet and dry rice powder foundation
I haven't used this in a very long time
it's I don't know it's good but I think
it's just getting old and you know
there's this weird sponge you can use
that I wouldn't dare use now so Pilate
oh wise I'm not going to keep this I'm
just gonna keep those rice paper sheets
so here's the overview these are what
I'm keeping and this is what I'm getting
rid of now obviously with foundations I
know they're gonna go bad eventually but
some of them I'm keeping cuz they're
brand new and I'm gonna review so
keeping in mind that this is one of my
jobs and that I do
have a beauty channel I do want to keep
a decent selection of some drugstore and
some high-end especially if they're ones
that I like I'm not gonna keep them if I
don't which is evidence probably the
fact that I am getting rid of some more
expensive ones like that Kevin a Quan
over there in the bareMinerals ones but
I'm also getting rid of some of the
drugstore ones that either are
completely my wrong shade or they've
gone bad or they're just not being used
so I'm pretty proud of how much I got
rid of I certainly got rid of a lot more
in some of my other videos that I'm even
more proud of but I think I did an okay
job I think that the next time I do a
declutter of these particular products
maybe next year or towards the end of
this year I'm probably going to revisit
a few of these like that Tarte one and
see if I've used it and if I like it
anymore and things like that but other
than that I'm all of the rest of these
that I'm keeping are ones that I use so
if you are interested in seeing my other
decluttering videos there are a ton of
them I'll link the playlist below other
than that please like if you enjoyed it
and subscribe and I'll catch you guys in
my next one bye
