beginning of my humungous makeup
declutter series now I've done some D
clutters in the past which I can link
below where I've done like my entire
makeup declutter collection that made no
sense my makeup collection declutter in
one video but my makeup collection has
grown a lot
obviously as my channel has grown and as
I've been doing this longer so I feel
like I should segment it into different
videos and I've seen so many people do
that and I love it that way because if
there's a certain makeup tight like I'm
not really that big into liners I mean I
love eyeliner but I'm not that big into
it so I can skip over the videos I don't
want to watch it I can just watch the D
clutters or the ones that I do plus if I
did this all in one the video would be
hours long and I don't know anyway so
I'm going to segment this so far I'm
looking at my word document over there
and I have it segmented into 15
different videos we'll see if it is I
know that's ridiculous but I also want
to keep these kind of short and sweet so
we'll see if I actually do you guys know
me but regardless I'm so excited and I
think you guys will really enjoy this I
know I've been looking forward to
decluttering this collection for so long
because it's making me crazy and my
lovely lovely fiance
Tyler who I love and his channel he has
his own channel if you want to check it
out a link below of course shameless
plug because he is hilarious and I love
him so much anyway he for my birthday
bought me a new Alex 9 drawer set and
now I've got the Alex 5 drawers and then
a tabletop so I've kind of created my
own desk vanity but I've kind of
outgrown it so he bought me the 9 drawer
to go right next to it I'm so excited to
have the extra room so if you are
interested in watching all of my
different declutter videos please
subscribe so that they'll just pop up in
your newsfeed when they first are
uploaded and I'm so excited so let's all
just shut up and let's go ahead and get
started so just to give you a little
behind-the-scenes action here this is
what I've got going on storage wise so
I've had these for a while these are the
two Alex 5 drawer sets and these are a
lot deeper this way then the Alex 9
drawer sets are I love them so much and
they are so function
because they're right next to me so I
can keep my make it really close while
I'm getting ready over here I've got a
Muji five drawer that I don't love just
because I feel like you're so limited to
what you can keep in it because they're
so so shallow got my some of my brushes
they're you know just normal things and
then this is the new Alex 9 drawer that
Tyler got me for my birthday and so
there's nothing in that right now
because I want to really go through this
and then really be thoughtful about the
way that I organize it to make it
functional but also so that I don't feel
overwhelmed every morning when I get
ready and I have in this Shore over here
and you'll see it an everyday makeup
drawer and that's where and I do a whole
series on that where I show you
basically each month sometimes more
often what makeup products I've kind of
pulled out to use that month ones that
I'm loving or ones that are brand new
that I just bought or whatever so that
has helped me not feel as overwhelmed
with this giant collection but I do
think I need to be more thoughtful and
plus my my organization is just a mess
right now
so let's go ahead and get started so
starting with this drawer from my Muji 5
drawer I've got lip products both on top
of the Muji in a drawer and then also in
another of my Alex drawers in an
organizer so I really need to work on
getting all my lip products together but
let's go ahead and get started here I
guess we'll start with these I have
seven of these lip what are these the
Revlon lip butters and I used to have
even more and in a past clutter video I
got rid of a bunch but I still have so
many and I never wear any of these the
only colors that I feel like I don't
know let's go through we've got berry
smoothie Beauty papaya sorbet candy
apple tutti frutti lollipop and sweet
tart my favorite is peach parfait and I
don't even have it because I've used it
up and I never repurchased it but I
don't I think I've decided I just don't
like the formula these feel so messy and
slidy and they like slide all over your
lips outside of your lip line and these
aren't the kind of product I want to use
the lip liner with because that kind of
defeats the whole idea of a lip butter
in my opinion so the only one I'm
thinking about keeping is berry smoothie
because it's a really pretty like fall
color but no no because I don't like
formula and there's no point in keeping
it so those are give away well all right
next the maybelline color whispers the
one I have less for blush strike a rose
and coral ambition and out of all of
these lust for blush is oh my gosh like
a favorite to the max I've had it for
quite a while and in my 2014 Jaime's
video where I go through like my
favorite from the entire year this is
like my favorite lip product so
definitely keeping that one now these
two I like this formula a lot better so
if you're going to try one or the other
definitely do the color whispers because
they don't necessarily have glitter in
them like those do Streicher Rose is
pretty but it's really really similar to
lust for blush and I don't eat both so
I'm just going to get rid of that and
then coral ambition it's kind of too
peachy for me so I think that one's
gonna go - all right I'm rocking it all
right these are two elf ones that elf
actually sent to me and I just recently
got them I mean I really haven't tried
them out much i think i swatched them in
a haul video recently this one is wine
tour and this is crazy cranberry and
wine tour is a little more like purpley
and the cranberry let me look at wine
tour cuz if I'm going to keep one I
think it's going to be this one I mean
it's really really pretty it almost
matches my shirt perfectly um I think
I'll keep wine tour and then get rid of
crazy cranberry alright um this is the
star looks Ashley Hackman when she kind
of worked with them to do a star box and
I remember when I unbox this on my
channel a lot of you guys said oh if you
got this and your thing then you like I
don't remember it was like something
special I have no idea I don't even
remember but the packaging is kind of
wearing off there which is kind of a
downer and also it sits in the shade
kinky and it is not a color that I'm
gonna wear it's like this bright orange
II it's just not going to happen so I'm
just gonna go ahead and get rid of it
now no point in holding on to it alright
this Akari or her carry it's in the
shade Cabernet ooh
this kind of reminds me of that
what's the color of the Year this year
marsala in a way see this is just it I
didn't even know I hadn't even swatched
this I didn't even know that I had this
amazing shade that's terrible
so I wish I would have worn that today
this is beautiful so I am going to keep
that love it this this infuriates me so
you guys know how much I love HauteLook
and I I mean I talk about all the time I
know I talk it to death but I love it
and that's how I'm able to get a lot of
like expensive products like tart and
Stila for way cheaper because otherwise
I just couldn't afford it all the time
this Tarte lipstick it's in the shade
fierce I had ordered one from them but
it was in a more berry color and they
sent me this one and then I just never
bother returning it now it's too late
the formula is really really nice
however this color while absolutely
gorgeous is not one that I am probably
gonna wear and frankly I already have
enough Reds it's Rossi this is a downer
though because it's so crazy buttery I
mean it is beautiful look at that but
I'm just not gonna wear it and I haven't
worn it I've only swatched it so I think
that one is just gonna go wow there's a
lot that I'm getting rid of this is
awesome okay so moving forward we've got
this star looks 1 it's an infinity lip
color and it's in the shade limitless
whoa that's different than I had
anticipated
oh I might hold on to this in a maybe
pile for this video while I go through
the rest if I have something really
similar then I might get rid of one of
them but if I don't then I'm going to
keep this because I don't know that I
have another color like that and that I
mean even though I wouldn't wear it
often I do want to have at least one
color like that just you know you never
know so for now I'm going to keep it but
I'm going to go through and see if I
have another one that's similar whoops
it's rolling away ok this is an elf
matte lip color hmm what is this shade
it's rich red I don't know I mean it's a
really pretty color and I like that it's
more of a blue tone kind of raspberry
red
and I don't have any of the other elf
matte lip colors and I do a lot of elf
videos like best and worst and this is
really good so even though I might not
wear it often I might keep it just so I
can use that as a reference because I
mean it is a nice matte lip color I
really should try that out more I've
only had it like a month okay this let's
see this is a Mary Kay creamy lip color
subscribers sent this to me
in Carefree coral oh yeah I remember
this I liked it because it wasn't so
coral that it was unwearable it was a
really like genuinely pretty kind of
pinkish coral looks very similar to that
one what was that oh that was the Hikari
one hmm
I've never reached for it so there's no
point in keeping it if I'm never ever
using it so I'm just going to get rid of
it this is a nother mary kay this is in
sunny citrus whoa this is another one no
no way that is a straight orange it's I
mean the formula you can tell is really
nice just honestly it feels just like
that really expensive tart one so the
formula is great the color is just not
my color so I'm going to pass that on to
someone that could rock that a little
more than I could this one I know I'm
getting rid of this is the Mirabelle a
sweet velvet lip pencil and there to it
like runs outside of my lip line when I
wear it's a gorgeous shade and it's
really buttery and if you like that then
you'll like this but for me it's in the
shade sweet I don't member if I said
that for me it just it gets too messy
and muddy on my lips so I'm just going
to toss it in my toss that I mean pass
it on this is a bare minerals miniature
lipstick and it's in get ready and this
is another like marsala color and it's
so pretty in this formula is unfreaking
believable so I'm going to keep this but
I need to actually make myself use this
my problem is I don't like grabbing
these miniatures because I like having
like a full-size lipstick like in my
hand but it really is amazing so I am
going to keep it isn't that beautiful
I'm going to get rid of this one I have
a few bright Pink's that I wear from
time to time probably not really often
in person but in videos because it's
just fun and funky but this one it's
okay
hey and the formula is not bad it's
pretty good to be honest with you but
I'm just not reaching for it because I
so rarely wear them and when I do I
usually just reach for other bright
Pink's so gonna get rid of this one as
well these I'm going to save to go
through in a lip gloss I'm going to put
those to the side when I do my lip
glosses so let's keep going can we talk
about how this is my pile of getting rid
of and this is my pile of keeping this
is going so well so far hopefully I'll
keep going this strong but I will say I
know that this was kind of my area to
throw a lip products I don't use so
while I did really well here I have a
feeling I'm going to struggle a little
more with the rest of mine so let's see
how we do in the rest of it but so far
I'm really proud this is where right now
I've got the rest of my lip products
other than there's a few on top of my
vanity which I'll show you in a second
so just for this video I'm going to go
through my lipsticks and I might have to
pull a few others from elsewhere but the
lip gloss is lip liners and stuff I'm
going through in another video so
looking through here I've got my Too Too
Faced I have two others oh here's
another one there's one so I've got my
three two-faced lipsticks and I have
another one that I love that's up there
these are got for like $8 on HauteLook
when they're originally like probably
twenty got cinnamon kiss fuchsia shock
and loganberry mmm I love these because
the packaging is so like hefty and nice
and the just it's just such a luxurious
product and I think they're just so
pretty the only ones I've really tried
have been was it Logan berry that I've
worn quite a bit because it's such a
pretty berry color and then what was
this one fuchsia shock is a fun bright
pink that I really liked I need to clean
that up and then cinnamon kiss is this
really beautiful like deeper but not too
deep again kind of a marsala color so
I'm definitely going to keep all of
these because I haven't had them for too
long and they really are amazing formula
I just I think I need to spend some time
real
determining what I like on me and what I
don't and then maybe I'll get rid of
some but I do love these this is one of
my two best ma lip sticks and this one
is in cherry red and it's this crazy
deep color it makes me look very very
vampy I've worn it in one video and it
was a long time ago and what was so
sweet is that a lot of you guys were
like oh my gosh I love it it's so fun
and bold and different but every time I
see that video like pop up and anyway or
I see myself and I'm like I don't know
but the formula of these these are still
pretty expensive there's still like $18
but the formula is amazing what I'm
wearing on my lips right now is the best
I'm a won an exotic pink which you'll
see in a second now it's like one of my
favorite of all time
so mmm I'm going to think about this one
this is going to be a maybe alright
let's just move along this back row this
is a bare minerals and light it up it's
a can never remember how to do this
packaging this came for free from Ipsy
like for referral credits or whatever
your I don't remember what it is I think
if you review things or refer people you
get points and this was one of the free
things you could get which is insane
because it's a full-size it's a pretty
color
but will I ever wear it probably not I
mean it's so Orange I don't think I will
I think I'm going to get rid of it
these are two Revlon colors we've got
pink in the afternoon and Primrose and
let's see which one's this one Primrose
is like a really pretty sorry I'm like
oh that's such a pretty color it reminds
me in a way of lust for blush so I'm
definitely gonna keep Primrose oh I love
that one
and then pink in the afternoon is kind
of a more it's kind of gotten messed up
there uhm reserved pink I think I'm just
going to keep these I love them rough so
these rough on lipsticks are really
absolutely amazing and if you've never
tried them or if you if you're trying to
find a really good drugstore lipstick
these really are amazing I can't believe
these are the only two I own right now
but they really are beautiful in the
packaging I think is beautiful and
classic as well
all right let's continue with our drug
store these are the Milani ones I hate
the smell of these you guys these are
like I just don't know I cannot stay in
the smell of these but the formula is
nice
this one's dulce Caramella or Dolce
caramel oh and it's a really pretty nude
color you can tell I've like hardly used
it like it all though but the formula is
amazing but I just have too much and
this one's in raspberry rush which I
raved about in quite a few videos
because it's such a fun color I mean
look at that isn't that fun I remember
my friend
Kirsten from it's Kirsten she ended up
buying this I think on my recommendation
but I just watching it I don't think I
can handle the smell of this I really
think I'm just gonna have to get rid of
them which makes me sad but I really
don't like the smell I can't do it these
are three Rimmel ones that I have so
I've got are these both Kate Moss yeah
these are both from the Kate Moss
collection this one is in number 17
which is again well actually this is a
little more orange I was going to say I
thought it was more of a marsala color
but it's a little more I don't even know
like rosy orange II not making any sense
but honestly I don't like the formula of
these this one is not in number five and
it's a really pretty color but I don't
like the formula they don't stay on I
think I'm just going to get rid of them
because I loved the packaging and I
think that's really why I bought them
but they don't stay on I don't like it
bye
good riddance now this isn't Rimmel
airy-fairy and a lot of people love this
one it is a really pretty color and this
formula I've noticed is a little bit
better than the Kate Moss one so in plus
this is just a cult classic I like I
need to use it more though because it is
beautiful so I am gonna keep that one
okay where to next I'm saving the Mac
once for in a second clearly these are
my three Sonia Kashuk I had more but
I've decluttered some the packaging is
adorable these are kind of pricey for
drugstore but my friend amber sent them
to me
so this
one is in classic red I don't know I
don't think well I don't own a lot of
reds if you haven't noticed and this one
it really is when we're talking about
classic red that really is a classic red
I just need to use it more often so I
think I'll keep that just to have a red
like that in my collection this one is
in rosette which is one of my favorites
I've used it quite a bit and I've
traveled with it also quite a bit so I
think I'm going to keep that one this
one now or maybe this was the one and
this isn't blushing I want to compare
the difference so this is blushing there
okay now I want to compare that to
rosette because I don't think I need to
keep both okay so that is blushing and
that is rosette because that's just a
little bit Pinker I think I'm going to
keep rosette I don't need both that is
for sure
and I mean I it's almost comical to even
look at the swatches because so many of
them are so similar like do I even need
any of these no I don't need them but I
love them alright so moving on this is
the it's like the teeny I don't see I
don't know what brand this is from but
it's in the shade plum wine it's a
pretty color but I don't love the
formula and I don't need it I've got
plenty of that color so that one's going
mirabela heat no I haven't even I don't
even know that i've swatched it i'm just
gonna leave it and maybe all i'll just
get rid of it these are my three wet and
wild ones now these have one of these
this is in Barrett all I do have bear at
all okay so one of my favorites is not
here because it's up and the other thing
so also you'll see that in a second
these are really inexpensive which is
great I've got two that are red like
that I bought for a Halloween I was I
was dressing as Flo the progressive lady
a couple of years ago and I bought both
of these because I couldn't decide which
would be more perfect but I don't I just
don't want them they're good but again
I've got a few Reds that I like and I
don't really need these so and Plus this
one which is in Purdy persimmon is too
orange so that one's definitely got to
go and this one's a little bit better
it's in red velvet but I don't
well maybe I'll keep that one because
it's so beautiful and so Matt isn't that
beautiful so I think I'll keep this one
and but I'll get rid of the other I need
to clean that up that's going to drive
me nuts
this one is in Barrett all now let's see
here I don't know you guys what do you
think I like it it's kind of really
brown because I don't have many brown
lipsticks and if I'm going to have one I
do love this formula so it kind of makes
sense so I might keep it for now and
give it a try now onto these Mac ones I
only have six met I say only that is way
more than I ever used to have I have six
MAC lipsticks and most of the time I get
them from a cosmetics company ala which
is the CCO when you hear people say
that's what that is and it's just like
the Estee Lauder family of companies if
you will they it's kind of like an
outlet and you can usually find them at
outlet malls so that's where I get them
for about ten dollars instead of 14 so
it's or whatever the price is so it's
not too bad this is okay I'm trying to I
don't think I'm gonna get rid of any of
these yet because they're all still new
to me and they're all I bought them
because I loved them this is the
craziest one I own which is Viva Glam
nikki is it the original yeah and that
is the craziest when I owned the rest
are all like I've got cream Cup and
Angel Saint Germain is pretty crazy as
well but it was so fun and again I want
to have some fun funky colors to play
with so I think I am going to keep all
of these for now but that's not bad I
got rid of like the whole row and a half
almost there so now I'm just double
checking but I don't have anything else
that's a lipstick that I need to go
through in this video right now
so this is my last grouping of lipsticks
and these are all typically my favorites
and I keep them up on top of my Muji
drawer because these are the ones I'm
reaching for all the time so I'm betting
that I won't get rid of any of these but
let's go through them just in case this
is my favorite wet-and-wild megalast
lipstick and it's in rose to fame I
cannot find a link for this online I
thought I didn't think it would be hard
to find I just recently got it though
and I it was in a new collection so
maybe it's just that it's new but it is
the most beautiful shade and I love the
formula so I'm definitely keeping that
these two Mac ones are in syrup and oh
okay so syrup is one of my favorites you
guys know that and in my Mac favorites
video I talked about that gave four away
this is the retro matte and all fired up
which is one of my favorite blue tone
Reds ever and it's matte and it's
beautiful and oh my gosh oh my gosh it
is so like when I'm wearing red I always
reach for this one this is the best ma
Cosmetics lipstick I was talking about
that I'm wearing at the beginning of
this video and currently which is an
exotic pink and it's just this beautiful
matte barbie pink but not Barbie in the
like lavender sense more like Barbie in
the classic pink sense I don't know
that's making no sense I love this so so
so much and all their packaging is very
like retro which i think is really not
retro vintage which i think is really
cool this is a favorite this is the
daringly nude maybelline matte lipstick
which again i talked about my jammy
awards for the past a year
this one is a covergirl one and eternal
which is another amazing kind of pinkish
red color more pink than anything I
guess it's so beautiful so that is a
favorite of mine this is a Trina
Tarantino one in the shade pendant and
it came in a did it come in a boxy
charmer did I make that up or maybe I
bought it on HauteLook I don't know but
it's this really pretty kind of light
it's gonna be hard to see with all the
swatches that I've been trying to wipe
off this kind of light coral or peach
color and I don't really have anything
like it so I definitely wanted to keep
that Plus this
edging is un-freakin'-believable so
heavy too this is the to face one called
in the buff that I wear a decent amount
it's different than what I usually wear
which i think is kind of fun
and that's why I'm excited to have it
and to keep it I know the lights kind of
washing it out a little bit and then the
last one in here this one's just new to
me which is why it's up here because I
want to use it it's a an SI Lauder pure
color lipstick and Barcelona rose these
smell amazing I am quickly realizing
that those three shades are very very
similar this one has more of a I mean
they're different in person but they are
still so darn similar but there are
three of my favorites so I don't want to
get rid of any and just yet and this one
I just haven't formed an opinion on so I
don't want to get rid of that yet either
so those are those not getting rid of
any of them which I'm not surprised so
this is everything that I am keeping and
this is everything I'm getting rid of
and I think my realisation while doing
just the lipsticks to start with is that
just because it was an expensive product
for example like this bareMinerals one
or this Tarte one those are in the best
I'm a one that I am getting rid of by
the way yes those are expensive and I
spent a good amount of money on them
however and well of course some I got
really good deals on but still it
doesn't mean that you have to keep it
because if it's not any use to you and
if you're not ever using it then there's
no point in keeping it because you're
not getting your money back by holding
on to it there's literally no benefit
other than it just takes up more room in
your collection and the other thing that
was hard for me is like these Milani
wands I don't wear very often but I love
the way they look and so I feel like I
was keeping them just cuz I loved the
gold packaging and you know that way I
would have them in case anyone talked
about them but it doesn't matter if you
have them or if they look good because
again I'm not using them so that was my
biggest battle I think when it comes to
this but I'm very proud very proud of
how much I'm getting rid of and while
I'm sad to see them go I know that they
will go to people that love them let me
know if you're interested in any of
these items I didn't think that I was
going to sell any of them but
some you know I've only swatched and
there's nothing wrong with them and they
were really nice so let me know if you'd
be interested in something like that I
haven't really decided if I'm going to
or not
I certainly have plenty of sisters and
friends that I can pass these on to but
you know I only have so many and this is
a lot of lip products so let me know if
you're interested down below if I did do
a sale I would do it on my Instagram
that's how I've done them in the past
and it just seems to be the easiest kind
of across the board so if you are
interested definitely find me on
instagram the link is down in the
description box because if I did it
that's where I would do it if you
enjoyed that please subscribe I would
love to have you it's a really happy
community over here on my channel which
I love and I just love all of you guys
did not feel good it just feels so thick
and I love it so much if you have filmed
your own declutter video or series of
videos please link it below my watch
later playlist is literally filled with
declutter videos because I love watching
them just oh I love it so just stay
tuned for my future declutter videos and
I'll catch you guys in the next one bye
my next favorite is the Sally Hansen
bleep salon manicure and golden rule now
I don't know if this is limited edition
or not and I think someone sent it to me
but it is the most opaque gold glitter
that you will ever find and when you put
this on top of like a white nail polish
I just use like a 99-cent wet and wild
white polish that's just plain white and
then you put this on top of it it makes
the gold just boom it looks like a wall
of gold glitter and that's exactly what
you want especially if you're doing like
a golden accent nail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
