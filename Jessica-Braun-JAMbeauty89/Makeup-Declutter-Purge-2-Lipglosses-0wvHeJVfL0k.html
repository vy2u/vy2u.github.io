lipglosses now it's a little
overwhelming and I have a few like lip
products that I should have gone through
in my like lipstick kind of declutter
even though they're not totally lipstick
so I forgot to do that so I'll go
through these in this session here okay
so starting here these are two buxom lip
glosses that I've got this one's in
Sophia and this one is in what is that
shade dolly and I love these oh my gosh
I love them so much so these I'm
definitely keeping Sophia I've almost
used up if you can't tell
and then dolly I haven't really used
much so these I'm definitely keeping
these are amazing
seriously seriously amazing this is a
jouer one that i got for free with like
a Birchbox order it was like if you
spend twenty dollars in the like buying
a full-sized product on Birchbox comm
you get like a free zoo a lip gloss it
was something awesome like that so and
this is a full size so definitely gonna
keep this I really haven't tried it yet
it's in the shade peony and it looks
like a really pretty yeah like a nice
light pink I feel like that'll be really
pretty in the springtime don't you think
so definitely gonna keep this one
where's the top there is these NYX
butter glosses I just got these I think
I featured them in a holiday wishlist
video one of these is this the one I've
had for a while this is creme brulee
wait is this the one or do they all for
coming I don't remember regardless I
like these and I really haven't tried
them out enough I think to get rid of
them if I did get rid of one it would be
the red one which is cherry pie
you know what maybe I will just get rid
of it because I'm not gonna wear that if
I'm gonna wear red I'm probably not
gonna be wearing a gloss on top of it
and if I did I could just put a clear
gloss so I think this is one that I'm
gonna say goodbye to because I've
literally never used it on my lips
I've only swatched it once and well
twice now
and I don't know I'll get rid of that
one this one let me swatch these this is
sugar cookie these came in like a set
like a trio set I would probably wear
that not on its own but maybe over a
nice kind of magenta lip gloss this one
is in cupcake and oh I really like that
one that one's a lot more pigmented than
the other ones were interesting and then
creme brulee I know I'm gonna keep that
I love so alright umm this Tarte lip
gloss it's in the shade exposed I got
this in a boxy charm they give so many
full-size like crazy expensive products
it's it's actually nice and you know
this is gonna be a good one over like
all of the lipsticks that I kept all the
neutrals this would be a nice one to put
on top of that so I need to get better
about wearing this so I'm gonna keep
this one plus it's like brand new this
is one of my favorites this is the NYX
lip gloss in beige eye it's like the
packaging is kind of a mess because it's
been in my purse for like ever it is the
prettiest pink ever I the smell is
really strong cherry smell but if you
can get past that which for this I'm
willing to it I don't mind it that much
it's not nearly as bad as like the
Milani stealth so definitely keeping
that that is a longtime favorite of mine
okay
these two-faced glamour glosses i got on
HauteLook for really cheap this one is
in strip tease and this one is in erotic
geez these names first of all let's talk
about how beautiful this packaging is
but let's also talk about how I've had
them for a few months and I've literally
never used them either one so I'm
thinking like why have I not use these
let me swatch them this is the yeah this
is erotic
yeah I've literally never used it can
you tell look at that ooh that's pretty
though
okay let's see this one is the
striptease this one looks a lot more
very like okay these are so pretty I
can't get rid of them yet can you blame
me this one I have swatched cuz you
could tell but the other one I literally
hadn't even opened that is insane I need
to actually use these though cuz those
are both absolutely beautiful and they
are these the ones that smell like mint
let me double-check that yeah it has a
pleasant smell but I can't tell if it's
really minty or not okay I'm not doing
so good you guys I love all of these or
at least a lot of them are new and I
wanted you to try them out these are
Estee Lauder this is brand new it's like
a lip lacquer and I just featured it in
one of my videos it's in wet plum and it
is amazing isn't that amazing it's not
quite a gloss obviously but oh that is a
definite keeper and then this one I've
had for a while that a subscriber sent
that I love and it's in what is it pink
shimmer or pink innocence and it's just
this gorgeous light pink shimmery and I
do wear this one actually quite a bit so
definitely keeping those nards Turkish
Delight I just recently got this and I
love it so and it's a cult classic I'm
not getting rid of it I use it it's in
my purse most of the time and you guys
know that this is one of my favorites
the vanilla pink lipgloss from
bellapierre that I adore so I will not
be getting rid of it so so far I've
gotten rid of one but in all fairness
this these are like my favorite lip
glosses or new ones so I kind of knew I
wouldn't get rid of many let's tackle
this section right here this is where
I'm gonna be a little more cutthroat I
hope all right this is the Revlon lip
gloss and pango peach I've had this for
quite a while now it's a really pretty
peach but I just don't ever ever reach
for it so why keep it right I think I'm
just gonna get rid of it this is a
Smashbox limitless long-wear lip gloss I
have had this since I started watching
YouTube videos a very long time ago oh
it smells bad oh this is the first lip
gloss I think I've ever had that
actually like smelled bad by I don't
like most lip glosses I get rid of him
before they ever get to that
point but that smells terrible okay this
one oh my gosh this is from starlooks
and it's just a miniature and it's in
the shade guilty-pleasure and I wear
this all the time it is the most perfect
I love the smell of it I want a
full-size it look how beautiful that
color is it is just the most perfect
everyday color you don't need anything
under it or anything it is so gorgeous
and I love the like iridescent shimmer
to the packaging I just I need to buy
the full size of it and that's that this
might be next to my vanilla pink this
might be my favorite lip gloss of all
time it is so amazing so definitely
keeping that one cargo this one was new
and I don't remember where I got it but
it's new to me it's in the shade Tuscany
and I want to keep this is gonna sound
dumb but I want to keep it because Tyler
and I are pretty positive we're gonna go
to Paris in Italy and Switzerland for
our honeymoon and so Tuscany I just feel
like I should wear it when we're in
Italy I know that sounds dumb but I'm
just gonna be honest but it's a really
pretty like kind of sheer color so that
would work it's got a little bit of a
peach tone but that would work well on
top of really anything so I think I am
gonna keep that one buxom white russian
absolutely adore this one is like more
than half gone it's again kind of like
the Turkish Delight well they're kind of
similar colors but they're both cult
classics and I finally splurged on it
and I love it I love all the buxom ones
just the way they make my lips feel it's
unlike any other lipgloss so that is a
definite keeper okay this one was just
sent to me by a subscriber and I am so
excited and it is literally out of all
of the melted ones I'd never tried them
but this is the color I would have
wanted to buy for myself anyway it's in
melted peony and it is the most
beautiful light pink so I'm definitely
keeping this and I'm very thankful that
was so awesome
okay hello this one this came in a Mimi
box and it's I guess the brand is NSM
and it says reborn sorbet tints and I
have never ever worn this it's like this
kind of jelly orange red formula I mean
it
it looks very pigmented and more like a
lip lacquer but I'm never gonna wear
that so that is gonna go for sure rim
will show off lip lacquer this is an
apocalyptic see these are beautiful oh
my gosh that is a beautiful color I need
to wear these more because I remember
buying these and really liking them and
I remember when they first came out
there was a big boom and like everyone
was buying them and then no one used
them but they really are actually
amazing I feel like a lot of new
products everyone buys because they're
new and then they're like oh yeah I love
it but then they don't use it because
they're actually not that good but these
actually really are good I don't know
that all the shades are as good but this
one is beautiful so I want to keep that
one this is in celestial and this is
more of a pink oh my gosh that is
absolutely stunning I see I didn't even
realize how pretty this one was I don't
know that I've ever worn this well I'm
sure I have but and then this one I
actually just did I used in a face of
the day on it's all over this on
Instagram where I post like what makeup
I'm wearing that day and this is in the
shade Luna and it is this a mini zhing
like coral color now it can look really
orange in the wrong lights and that's
where I'm torn because when I put it on
in the morning that I posted that that
Instagram post I had mentioned that like
I'm falling in love with it while I had
been putting it on really early in the
morning when I got in my car and like
saw it during the daylight it really did
look pretty Orange so I don't think I'd
realized in the fake light in my room
just how orange it looked so I think I
am going to pass this on it would look
beautiful on a really dark skin tone but
when I am that fair I mean it just kind
of looked crazy so that's that okay this
is an elf extra lip gloss in the shade
Luke and one of my subscribers told me I
didn't realize the idea is the names of
these are all guy names and they're
supposed to be names of like your exes
that's why it's called extra so this is
Luke it is a very vampy color looking
across the only color similar is that
Estee Lauder one there but this is a
little more matte
because that's a lacquer and this is
more gosh this is less of a gloss is
almost well no I guess it is glossy but
I'm gonna keep that because it is the
only elf lip gloss I own and else
obviously you guys know I love elf I do
elf videos all the time
and I think their glasses are really
really nice so I'm definitely gonna keep
that now moving forward these are a few
others that I should have covered in the
other video but we're gonna do it now
the revlon colorburst in demure aegyo so
back and forth this is the only revlon
balm stick or whatever out of all of
them that i've kept over the years over
the past year really because it's just
such a pretty everyday color and you
guys know me i'm more apt to wear it if
it's just a normal color because you
know i live a real life and i have a
real job and i would look ridiculous if
i went to school in like this color
so for everyday I love color and look
how gorgeous that is I mean that is
beautiful the only downside is it does
have a little bit of glitter but these
are minty they're nice and I already own
it I think I'm just gonna keep it this
however this is an LA Colors chunky lip
pencil in the shade I don't know where's
the shade name wine and I've only
swatched it it's a very sheer and I
think this is I mean this is the way
it's supposed to be I think they're made
to be that way it's just kind of a fun
kind of buttery and it is really buttery
color that just goes right on but if I'm
going for a color like that I want
something that's not gonna look sheer at
all so I'm gonna pass this on to someone
that will love it more than I have the
same idea it's a NYX butter lip balm and
it's in the shade ladyfingers and again
it's kind of more of in my opinion a
color that I wouldn't want to look
washed out it just looks a little bit
crazy on my lips so again this is a nice
formula it's just I'm just not gonna
wear it so I'm gonna pass that on as
well these okay now we get into like my
squeezy tubes oh and this came in a Mimi
box it's some sort of like candy cane
lip thing I'm
we're gonna wear that oopsie now I can't
get it down crap
well ooh there we go I'm just never
gonna wear it
these two were sent to me from a
subscriber I've literally used this a
lot and never use this so I think what
I'm gonna do is keep this one because
it's this beautiful pink shimmery and I
actually do use it on top of bold color
this one I think I've literally never
even squeezed out it is literally brand
new so I'm gonna pass that on these two
this one is pretty awesome I don't love
it every single day because I feel like
it drives my lips out just like ever so
slightly but it looks amazing on top of
other lip colors and I love the minty
feel on my lips and CEO Bigelow is just
one of my favorite brands so I'm gonna
keep this one and then the CEO Bigelow
my favorite lip balm I recently got with
my favorite night bomb right here and
actually I'm realizing I should be doing
these in my lip balm video but oh well
I'm gonna keep both of these so those
are Coopers so this is what I am keeping
and these are what I'm getting rid of
it's not quite as successful as my
lipstick video where I got rid of almost
half but lip glosses are something that
I really I kind of go through on my own
and throw out so almost all of these are
new because I I just go through them all
the time and get rid of some that either
I've already used up or they're just I
don't know it's just I don't like
holding onto lip glosses for too long so
really I think almost every single lip
gloss in here was bought bought or
received within the past year and even
these I think were received within the
past year I really don't hold on the
only old one I had was this Smashbox one
so some of these I'm gonna pass on a
sister so stay tuned for my next
installment of my ginormous declutter
series check below for links to the ones
I've already uploaded and if you want to
start at the beginning of my entire
series where I explain it all and kind
of go through the way that I organize my
makeup as well check below for that link
and I'll catch you guys in my next one
bye I got three other foundations these
I have not tried yet so this is the fit
meet but it's the new math and poreless
foundation so it's for normal to oily
skin I got in the shave 112 natural
ivory which i think is actually a pretty
good match for me he and I really
excited I hate the packaging that is
there's no pump and it's on a squeeze
tube because it just it just gets so
messy but so that's one thing I picked
up I also in the same type of packaging
pick up the Rimmel lasting finish 25
