okay so now we're gonna tackle all of my
lip balms and also lip liners so this is
actually I got my fiance Tyler the GoPro
cuz he has his own travel channel here
on YouTube which I can link below
because it is awesome but I got him a
GoPro for Christmas and this is actually
the box that like came in and he was
like what should I do with this and I
was like I think I've got a use for it
so I just kind of stacked all of my lip
balms in it and it's actually perfect
except for this is way too many lip
balms I do not need this money so I
can't wait to go through these same goes
for lip liners so anything that I'm
going to keep out of these I'm going to
put in here and anything I'm gonna get
rid of I'm gonna put up on my desk and
I'll show you at the end what I'm
keeping when I'm getting rid of okay
let's start right the top this is the
Tokyo milk dark lip balm and it's in
salted caramel now this came I got this
in a rose 1 and I think I passed the
rose went on to I don't even know who
his sister or my mom or someone it
smelled gosh I can smell it from here it
smells like salted caramel like popcorn
almost and it's a good lip balm but the
smell is just so odd so but I'm torn
because I really do like the lip balm I
don't know this is gonna be a maybe I'm
gonna set it over there and think about
it for a second this I love this is the
co Bigelow rose Sal what I like about
this I have the Smith's rose self which
is amazing but this one even though it's
a different brand a very similar
consistency and everything and I buy
this at a Peabody works by the way it
has this amazing almost sweet rose smell
whereas the Smith's rose self is very
very like straight rose this one has
like a sweet smell to it and I love it
so I'm definitely gonna keep that one
and isn't the packaging adorable I mean
come on this it's one of those like um
like what do they call it like the
coconut infused or I don't know it's
nice it's okay it is not my favorite
it's not as good as the sweet mint so
this is gonna be a maybe as well this is
gonna be a big video of maybes until the
end when I decide
this one is this Pixy tinted bomb
there's literally not really a tent at
all to it I mean truly I don't know it
might like adjust once it's on your lips
packaging is cute which is why I want to
keep it however I'm never using it so
I'm just going to get rid of it I need
to stop keeping things because of the
cute packaging elf lip balm tint I
bought when I bought a bunch of elf
stuff because I do tons of elf videos
and it's okay I mean it's got some color
to it but I never ever wear it it's not
a color I will wear it's kind of got
that oranjee red tint to it and so I've
I don't know that I've ever worn it to
be honest I just watched it like a
million times when I think about getting
rid of it so I'm gonna say goodbye to
that guy alright this is the soft lips
cube and I've used quite a bit of it and
it smells really really really good it
smells amazing like berries and sugar
that's exactly what it smells like I
don't know what like scent this was or
whatever but anyway I really like this
I'm gonna keep it I need to just use it
up because it's it's great I found these
at Big Lots for a couple bucks which
really I don't know that it's discounted
at all because I'm pretty sure these are
a couple bucks at Target too
anyway I thought about buying another
one because they have a few different
colors and I do really like it so I am
gonna keep that one use it up okay so
this Carmack's healing lip balm I do not
use this everyday because I swear it
ruins my lips but when I am like
suffering from a cold sore or anything
like that
I like having this because I swear it
works but I've had this for quite a
while and I'm starting to wonder if it
let me smell it no it smells just like
karmic should smell I think I'll keep it
for now this is almost something I feel
like I should put in like a medicine kit
because I genuinely only use it for when
I like when I've got serious lip issues
but I will keep it for now I love this
stuff okay this is the only lip scrub I
own now I used to have like the elf one
that's in like stick form and I used to
not like it and then everyone was saying
you know no you're using it wrong which
I was I should have like it doesn't
matter anyway but I ended up getting rid
of that because it was getting pretty
small and old this was in a meanie box
of some sort and it's just this
chocolate a lip scrub it's got a little
grit to it it smells great and it really
is really good it's really finely milled
grit in there whatever you want to call
it doesn't it look just like actual
chocolate but it smells amazing using it
my lips are so smooth after using it so
this is the only lip scrub I have I'm
definitely going to be keeping this okay
now let's dig into it okay Mary Kay
satin lips lip balm this where's the
other one god yes in the lip mask these
I want to try out some more I'm still
working on a Mary Kay video I know
everyone's been dying to see it but I
feel like I still haven't tried
everything enough because there's just
so much so I'm going to be working on
that soon so I want to keep these just
to be able to speak about them there
because I've tried them a few times that
I really really like them I'm not gonna
keep this this is a vitamin E stick my
mom I've used it quite a bit
my mom is big into this and her lips are
really really soft but my lips do fine
without it and I just don't find myself
ever using it certainly getting old so
I'm just gonna get rid of that this is
brand new it's this candy corn one I've
never even broken the seal that I got in
I don't even remember it might have been
that cozy mug tea coffee box they always
send some cute like lip balms and cute
things in there with the tea and coffee
but I'm never gonna use it I'm not a big
fan of the smell of candy corn so I'm
gonna pass that on aquaphor I really
never use this this is another one that
I have just because everyone says it's
the best for your lips but the few times
I've used it I didn't like it like my
lips didn't do very well so I think I'm
just gonna pass it on this is yes this
is the SPF lip balm that I bought from
Vitacost it's Alba Botanica I'm gonna
keep it because I do put it in my beach
bag every time I've gone to the beach
which is not that often but I always put
it in there cuz it's it's got a high
high SPF so that is a keeper for that
purpose alone
I'm gonna pass this on this is an EOS
stick and I loved the idea of the EOS
being in a stick form except for this
sense or this flavor whatever you want
to call it dries my lips out like crazy
so I love it I think the packaging is so
cute but I'm gonna pass it on Nivea kiss
of mints and minerals is it makeup by
Tiffany d that talks about this all the
time this charge my lips out too and I'm
so sad because again the packaging is
just so sweet and cute but it messes me
up I don't know what's wrong with me and
then this is from a sweet subscriber
that sells these balm a bowl lip balms
on her Etsy page and it smells amazing
so I'm gonna keep that I actually used
quite a bit of it up so I'm gonna
continue using that up alright so moving
on to liners I don't know how many of
these I'm gonna get rid of just yet
because a lot of them are ones that I'm
wanting to know let's just see so the
first one this is a Pilate oh one it's
their herbal precision lip liner and
candy apple and it's this bright red lip
liner it's a beautiful color amazingly
slighty almost creamy is maybe the
better word for it but I never used it
so I'm gonna pass it on I've got enough
red lip liner so that is gonna go
starlooks Roseate or Rosati i don't know
how to spell that
it's a beautiful just like classic nude
and as i swatched through these i'm
gonna see if i have another one like
this if I don't I'm gonna keep this or
yeah and if I do I might pass it on so
that's kind of a maybe there this is
another star looks one this is from the
Ashley Hackman collection and it's in
cherry cedar again another pretty kind
of pinky red I'm gonna see if I have one
similar if not I'll keep it but again I
don't really reach for those much but if
I want to have one in those colors if if
I ever needed one I don't want to have
to go out and buy one if I already have
it this is the Mac lip pencil in magenta
this is the only one I have like
and it is so fun I just love that color
it looks amazing under berry lips so
this is one that I will definitely be
keeping the NYX lip liner in nude pink I
bought this to be kind of oh that's just
like that one to be kind of like that
classic nude one that everyone was
trying to get except for I think I
bought the wrong one there's another one
that's like a dupe for it but I am so I
guess really it's between this starlooks
one in this NYX one don't you think I
mean they're a little different but
they're similar enough I don't need both
let me swatch these other Mac ones and
I'm going to compare all of them and
decide on one the other one this is Mac
lip pencil and dervish which is again
pretty darn similar a little bit darker
hmm okay so we're comparing that with it
wow I did not realize how many of these
I have that are system one and then this
one is probably the last one that would
be similar and it is in sore but I have
a feeling this one's gonna be yeah
that's quite a bit darker so sore I'm
definitely gonna keep and that's one
that like everyone's going cuckoo over
right now so it's between these three
I'm thinking that I mean I'm keeping
dervish no matter what this is one that
it's a nickname of mine dervishes hors
d'oeuvre so I have to keep us literally
why I bought it which means I think I
can get rid of the starlooks one and
then this next one it is a little Pinker
I might keep it anyway just in case but
let's keep going and let's see this is
the Mac lip pencil and beet and this is
my favorite like berry red so comparing
them to those this is like definitely a
keeper so I love it so definitely
keeping that this L'Oreal when I've had
for so long it's from its their lip
precision automatic lip liner and it's
in the pink / roses and it's I think
almost gone and it's a really pretty
color but I don't need it so I'm just
gonna pass it on
this is a starlooks oh this is in it's
an infinity lip pencil and Terry's
choice and these are like they're really
creamy options and look how beautiful
that is oh my gosh
I want like every single one of these
from the starlooks line they are I mean
oh my gosh it's so beautiful this is a
flower lip and shot or line and shine
lip liner and I love to use this one
it's more like a rosy color kind of like
the one I'm getting rid of from L'Oreal
but I love to use that I honestly use it
probably more than any of them so
definitely keeping this one and I love
the formula it's very very creamy this
is the only one I have like this this is
the star looks one in tipsy and it's
this crazy like neon coral I'm seeing
that it doesn't look as crazy
it looks so crazy in person it's amazing
and I have a few lipsticks that I kept
that would look great with this and
really wouldn't work with any other lip
liner so I feel like I just got to keep
it to have at least that option and then
this is a Sedona lace lip pencil it's
the or not lip pencil lip brush and it's
the only lip brush I own so I figure I
should keep that for now but I keep it
with my liners just cuz that makes sense
to me so let's see what we are left with
here so here is what I'm getting rid of
and here's what I'm keeping I think I
did actually a really good job I was
nervous that I wouldn't get rid of many
but I did decide to go ahead and get rid
of these just because I'm really not
using them I don't want to use them this
because of the smell and this because of
the formula so I did decide to do it
because I've got to cut back but I am
pretty proud and a lot of these will be
gone very soon that will be gone soon
that will be gone soon
so I'm pretty proud of how much now I
did keep a good amount of my lip liners
but there are either ones that I use all
the time or they're like a very odd
color that I would need with my odd
colored lipsticks you know what I mean
especially just given what I do so very
happy with what I've gotten rid of here
it feels really really awesome so if
you're interested in the lip glosses and
lipsticks I went through those in a
different declutter video and two
different ones actually so if you want
to watch all my declutter videos from
the beginning I will link them below
I'll link the playlist I'm going through
everything so definitely stay tuned I
think they're like 15 different
declutter videos that I'm going to do so
if you're interested subscribe stay
tuned Adam to your watch later whatever
you need to do I know that's what I do
and I will catch you guys in the next
one bye similar products to these would
be like the Revlon bone stains that are
the matte balm stains that's a similar
application and a similar packaging
these are a little bit thinner than
those for comparison and one huge
downside is that when I open these the
very first time I open them the thing
fell out and then when i swatched them
they were falling out and they were
falling out as I applied them and that
was true for both of them so that was
fun that's what's so fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
