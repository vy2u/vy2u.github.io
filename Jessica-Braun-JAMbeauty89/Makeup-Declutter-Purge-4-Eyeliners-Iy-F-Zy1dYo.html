eyeliner and that would be my pencil
eyeliners liquid eyeliners and like gel
liners so I keep all of my liners at
least for now in this Muji drawer that
goes in my Muji 5 drawer and then I also
have this that I got in a Mimi box so
I'm gonna organize it according to type
and maybe even according to color so
that like my clues are to get other
greens etc and then we will go through
it that way now organize them according
to color and then also according to type
so these are all of my pencil liners
these are like gold gold's bronzes
Silver's that type all like completely
black greens nudes and whites and then
blues over here so Mac here I've got my
liquid liners of all types and colors
this is that pack of the liners I showed
you and those are my two gel liners back
there so let's get in deeper shall we so
looking here I have one silver one and
this is from butter LONDON and it's just
this like kind of pewter pewter like
silvery grey it's the only one I have
like it so I'm going to keep it back
here I've got let's see these are both
kind of golden this was my favorite for
a long time this is the essence
long-lasting pencil in bling-bling and
it's the most beautiful gold isn't it so
I'm probably gonna keep that one but
let's see this is the star looks in
Oracle this one has a lot of gold
fallout and that's what I've noticed and
that's what I've even heard from others
so I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of
this one now this one is another star
looks in ultra olive ooh and it's a
really pretty olive green whoa I see I
didn't even realize that was a green
first of all second of all I didn't even
know I had this that is gorgeous so I'm
gonna put it with the greens and I'll
probably keep it but just so I can
compare it to those now this is another
kind of bronzy color Physicians Formula
and it was from the warm nude eyes like
trio that they have and it's pretty as
well but I don't think that I need this
in addition to everything else well but
that is pretty different from that well
it's not that
I think I'm gonna get rid of this one I
don't think I need it so get rid of oh I
need to like separate these huh those
are keeps this is get rid of okay so now
I'm down to like my two Browns this is a
Smashbox limitless one that's like a
dark brown that I have loved for a long
time this is a Pacifica one in well it
doesn't say oh there it is in fringe
yeah they're both virtually exactly the
same so I don't think I don't think I
need both so I think I'm going to keep
the Smashbox one because I've loved it
for a long time and pass on the Pacifica
one moving towards my black ones these
this one I use everyday this is a Mac
one it's one of their chroma graphic
pencils in black black that I know I'm
going to keep these this model Co one I
used for a long time just to try it out
but I don't love it I mean it's pretty
black but it's not I don't know it's not
really anything special and I hate when
sharpeners are included in the lid
because the lid never stays on so I
think I'm gonna go ahead and pass that
on this Palladio one is so so creamy but
it's almost I mean look at that that is
like black is black but it's almost too
creamy where it like gets everywhere let
me see something I don't know this one
is a Jordana one that's the 12-hour
liners and these are amazing those do
not budge so I'm gonna keep that one and
I think I'm gonna pass on the Pilate oh
one as well moving to the greens I've
already swatched this starlooks one
let's swatch these this is another star
luxe one and exit to Eden and it's like
a beautiful like bright green I love
this one so I think I'm going to keep
that one as well just because those are
very very different colors this one is a
Jordana 12-hour one again and it's
almost so dark that it's like well you
see those three are all so different
and I kind of like that that start
because I would work in a nice smoky eye
so I think I'm going to keep all three
because frankly I love green
and those three are all so different
that I mean they're just not interesting
okay moving on to like my nudes and
whites and things like that this one is
one that I got it's moose moose stuff or
whatever and it's in spot erasers so
it's more like a concealer pencil but
it's it's very like hard to work with
and it's not really a color that would
work with my skin tone anyway so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that on it's
like brand new this is a covergirl
flamed out pencil and I don't know what
the shade is but it's like one of those
and I just never use it I can use a
cream liner if I wanted to and it's I
don't know I just don't think it's
really anything so I'm just gonna pass
it on this one I love it's the Rimmel
scandaleyes in their nude shade and it's
just great in your waterline it's very
very creamy especially compared to that
Moustafa one that one was really not
creamy this one is so I need to clean it
up though it looks gross but I'm gonna
keep it this is one I just got from Lord
and berry on HauteLook and it's just
their white again for the waterline and
it's it's really really nice and it
stays on for a long time so I'm dead the
only white one I have now so I'm
definitely gonna keep that my blues and
some of this is kind of like tinted
purple as well so like this one is a
Pilate oh one and it's an ultra violet
so it's more of a purple tone like
almost an indigo it's really really
pretty but let's compare it to the other
ones this is a Tarina Tarantino I got
this in a boxy charm I think and it's in
cute robot which i think is such a fun
name and this is a lot deeper of a color
I think well no they're both pretty darn
similar and out of the two I like the
Torino Tarantino better so I'm gonna
pass on the Palladio and keep the Torino
one this is this crazy fun Jordana one
it's in the shade aqua stone and it's
this bright blue which i think is
amazing so I'm definitely going to be
keeping that one this is a star looks
one in blue chill and it's wow gosh
they're about the same color I didn't
even realize how similar those were
I love the starlooks one though too I
might keep the starlooks one and pass on
the pull of the Jordana because I love
em hmm I like both I think I might keep
both because I like having some Jordana
so I can have like a drugstore option if
I'm doing videos about it and I love
both so I think I'm just gonna keep them
both this is a Lancome one I got for
free as like for using credit or
something on boxy charms website and
it's a waterproof pencil and turquoise
and I don't know that I've ever used it
let's see hmm that's not really it's
almost like jeans you know what I mean
like it like a denim color I kind of
like it though because there's nothing
like any my other blues it's a little
more reserved and wearable so I think I
am gonna keep that one as well this came
in a Mimi box and I love that it's like
punk rock Snow White
I think it's so cute it's from Beauty
people and it's a special edition season
two and it's got these five beautiful
shades that I've only swatched and I
never use them because I have all these
colors in other forms and I don't know I
should use them because they really are
good let me swatch once you can see it
this beautiful bronze color these are so
creamy so pigmented and beautiful that's
it right there but I just have so many
eyeliners I'd rather just keep this
together and pass it on to someone that
would love it so that is what that's all
about so I'm gonna go ahead and pass
that on please this I used cream or gel
liner everyday and it's amazing that I
don't have more of these because I use
them all the time
this actually Hackman one from star lips
is the one that I've been using every
single day it is almost gone
this one I've had for a while and it's
pretty good I can't tell if it's dried
out or not though so what I need to do
is try it and see because when this one
runs out I will probably use this one
although really I don't love it so maybe
I'll just pass it on because I the
reason I stopped using is because I
didn't love it so much so I'm gonna go
and pass that on now and keep this one
cuz it's the one I use everyday these
are my lip
with liners and some few of these are
brand new this is the one I've been
using I've realized that I really do
like starlooks liners out of all of the
products they offer that's kind of what
I gravitate towards this is their liquid
liner I've been using it for months and
it still hasn't run out and it's just
this crazy crazy pigmented black in it
dry oh my gosh it's like the ideal liner
so I kind of hate how boring the
packaging is and I know that sounds
challo but I love it and I use it every
single day so I'm definitely keeping
that this BH liquid liner I used for a
long long time and I'm wondering if it's
dried out no it's actually it's kickin
too so I'm gonna go ahead and keep that
because I use these I mean I use liquid
liner everyday on top of the gel liner
so this is a Rimmel scandaleyes one I
don't think I loved this one let's see
it says it's waterproof mm-hmm and it's
just not quite as black as the other one
so I'm gonna go ahead and pass this on
it's it's like brand-new
this one the Jordana fabula nur I think
I need to get a new and this is the one
I just mentioned in my GME awards for
the best or 2014 because these are
amazing and they're so cheap and I
always end up going back to it
yeah still alive and kicking it's been
going strong for like ever so I'll keep
it I need to get a new one though
eventually you'd think this is one I
just got I used to have this a long time
ago and I literally just bought this but
it's not quite I got it in the shade
ultra black and it's not quite as black
as that I remember it being so well it's
looking a little better I think maybe it
just needs time to kind of get in the
zone if you will so I'm gonna keep it
cuz it's brand new and I like the
flexible brush head there but it needs
to like get back to its old glory this
is a brand new one for me it's a Stila
one in electric it's this gorgeous
shimmery like oh my gosh are you kidding
me so I'm definitely keeping that and
then this is one it's an Elizabeth Mott
one I got in a box boxycharm or
something maybe even a Dipsy probably
anyway it's in its year
so fine and it's in the shade glitterati
and if I remember right it's like this
glittery black let me see how you find a
spot to swatch it yeah and it's a really
really pretty glittery black and what
amazed me about it is that although
there's tons of glitter in it it's still
so black so this is one I don't have
anything like this and is the packaging
not absolutely adorable I thought that
was so cute so this is everything that
I'm keeping I'm pretty proud of how much
I got rid of this is everything I'm
getting rid of it's not a ton but it is
progress because I mean that's a ton of
eyeliners and I feel good about having
for the most part one of each color
other than like that one blue that I
just wanted to keep both for my channels
purposes
but I really really love everything that
I'm keeping I genuinely genuinely love
it and I like the way it wears so I'm
just so glad I'm a little torn on
getting rid of this cuz I love the
packaging I love the tin and you guys
know I'm a Disney fanatic so it's hard
for me to say goodbye to this but I was
only keeping it because of the cute
packaging and I've got to get rid of
things I cannot keep things just because
I like the way they look because there's
no point so I feel pretty good if you're
interested in seeing all of my other
declutter videos or watching it from the
beginning when I kind of go through that
the way that I organize my makeup
collection as well I will leave the link
below as well as the link for the entire
playlist of all of my declutter videos
and I will catch you guys in the next
one bye
the NYC BB cream retails for around 3 or
4 dollars at Walmart I find mine under
the store called Meijer so you can even
also order it online but it's really
really inexpensive but they only have a
couple color options the elf BB cream
has a few more color options but it
retails for six dollars on elfs website
don't know that I've seen this
particular product in stores that I know
target cells elves some Walmart's now
carry elf so you could look for it but
online you almost get better deals
because you can get a bunch of things
and their if they sell a lot more online
and you can always get free shipping
they always</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
