cream shadows my like pigments and also
my like primers so this one might be a
little bit longer and it's gonna be hard
because I love a lot of these products
but I also know that I really am not
using all of them so there's no point in
having this many of this type of product
so let's start with the thing that's
gonna be the hardest my cream shadows
that I love so I have five Mac Paint
Pots five elf cream shadows for Mary Kay
ones a sigma one and then a small
benefit one let's start with the elf
ones because these will be a little
easier to part with i've got ain't that
sweet pearls of wisdom this yellow one
got a glow back to basics and what is
that cruisin chic I have used which one
did I use a lot I think I used that
sweet a good amount because it's this
really pretty pink color that I liked so
I'm think I'm going to keep that one the
white one pearls of wisdom I think yeah
if you actually use that a bit too
because I don't have a white one which
you'll see in the rest of mine so I
think I'm gonna keep the white in the
pink the yellow oh wow that's the one
I've used the most of guess I'll keep
that I don't didn't realize how many of
these I was using that's actually pretty
awesome now this one is very similar to
ones I already used back to basics and
Cruzan chic yeah cruisin chic I've
literally never used so I'm definitely
gonna pass that one on because I
literally don't ever use it I want to
compare this to a few others that I
haven't decide if I want to keep it so
that's what I'm gonna do with that
so these let me get rid of I know for
sure I'm gonna keep these three right
yes okay this
see my Mac ones I've got bear study
which I use all the time it's just a
really really pretty
base for virtually anything I know I use
that one I'm crazy this one in let's
skate is this really pink but like
there's like a pearlescent shimmer to it
as well that's really really pretty it
reminds me however of the pink one from
elf but I kind of like that I've got a
cheaper version and inexpensive so I can
compare anytime you know I've got to
keep in mind that I also have a channel
that I want to make sure I've got
options if I only keep all the high ends
and that's defeating the purpose so I'm
gonna keep both because I really do like
the elf one as well
rubenesque is the one that I was
thinking might be very very similar to
this one maybe not though what is this
one back to basics let me swatch these
okay so that's back to basic oh these
are gonna be very different what am I
talking up oh no they're really pretty
much the same Wow Wow
that might be a dupe for that who knew
look at that that is the Mac one and
that's the elf one that's pretty cool so
I'm gonna keep both for due purposes I
guess because I want to be able to do
another dupes video soon and that is a
great one wow this is vintage selection
and this is one that I absolutely adore
it is the most beautiful like kind of
bronze II but not so bronze I mean it's
just gorgeous
I want to swatch this because I like
looking at it isn't that pretty
it's not I just think that's so
beautiful and I feel like not enough
people talk about vintage selection it's
like my favorite and then the last one
is painterly which I use everyday as
well like literally every day so
definitely keeping now now these Mary
Kay ones what amazed me about these is
that the formula stays on all day and I
like longer than anything else
I remember i swatched them on my hand
the day that I got them from a
subscriber and they would not come off
like I'm not even kidding you I had to
get waterproof eye which is great
because you want your shadow to hold
to it that way it really was pretty cool
so I have got iced cocoa which is this
really kind of deeper almost olivey
bronze in person and I like how sleek
this packaging is as well this one is in
Beach blonde and this is the one I
thought would be like bears study but I
didn't end up liking it as much because
maybe this wasn't the one oh that is
really pretty
why am I not using these this is like
bear study a lot actually
another dupe this one is in apricot
twist and this reminded me of rubenesque
but let's swatch it next to it and see
it's a little more almost peach so
pretty though oh my gosh this is really
hard you guys and then the last mary kay
one I've got is metallic taupe and this
one I've actually used a lot because
this kind of color looks really cool
underneath a like white powder shadow
because it just adds like an extra
dimension to it so I really I do like
dang it now the good news about this
metallic taupe one I don't have anything
like it so I don't feel guilty keeping
that one this is gonna take a minute
because these are all really good I
think I'm gonna pass on the iced cocoa
because it's a little dark I already
have some like it and it's also still
not a color I'm gonna use very often so
I think I'm going to go ahead and pass
that one on
this Beach blonde is so beautiful and
it's just like the bear study so I want
to keep it cuz that's a color that I use
all the time that way if I were to run
out of one or the other they're kind of
interchangeable this one what is this
the apricot I think I don't need it if
I've already got rubenesque and the elf
one so I think I'm gonna pass that one
on as well so so far I'm keeping these
to Mary Kay's like all my Mac ones not
getting anywhere but the Mac ones are
all like I recently got almost every
single one of these out of CCO when they
were pretty cheap so I don't really feel
guilty keeping those because they were a
little more expensive and they're really
amazing and I use all five of them so
far so these elf ones I kind of hate
that I'm only getting rid of one but
these really are all so beautiful I
don't feel the need to get rid of them
because they're just gorgeous and
they're gonna make for great dupe videos
for you guys if you want to even save
money because why would you not want to
save money if you can get this anything
for way cheaper okay so moving on this
is a sigma cream shadow when I first
became an affiliate like a thousand
years ago they sent me this but it's way
too dark I clearly used a lot of it but
I hate the packaging hate it like I hate
hate hate how ginormous this is but
beyond that I just the it's good but I
just hate the color so it's going it's
going going going bye that was in the
shade persuade by the way this is a
benefit cream shadow an RSVP that I love
it is this beautiful kind of pinkish I'm
sorry I'm running out of room for
swatches but it's like this beautiful
pinkish it's not showing up come on here
it is I just love it I don't know how to
describe it I want to get the full size
of this cuz when it's this small I'm
like digging and getting it like into my
nail which really grosses me out
so I I need to get the full size of this
I just don't want to spend the money but
at the same time this is absolutely
stunning and I love it so so much so
much
okay I need to wipe my hands off before
I vomit hold on okay so these are like
my pigments and loose cream shadowed not
cream blue shadows here I'm going to
move this out of the way for now so
these are the L'Oreal infallible I have
five of them I used to have way more but
I got rid of a lot that I just wasn't
using and I'm hoping to be able to do
the same thing today however I love all
of these colors okay
see this is gonna be hard this is
isolate a which is this gorgeous dupe
for Stila kitten I mean it's just
stunning I've noticed I need to like
break it up though because this top
layer has gotten kind of weird so I need
to just take like a little pic or
something and kind of break it up a
little bit just to get back that loose
quality because you know it can be
pressed which is what I like about this
it's kind of pressed down and held
together in a way but it's kind of
looking weird lately so I need to kind
of mess with this and get it back to its
former glory because it is a beautiful
one and if you've been eyeing Stila
kitten this has the exact same effect
exact so really you don't need to spend
the money this is exactly the same thing
like I can't stress that enough
this is amber rush which I have fallen
in love with it is the most beautiful
it's not a color that I would usually
grab for and now I just can't stop using
it so I know that I'm keeping that one
this one is what is it gilded Envy and
it's a really pretty color but I never
use it so I think I'm gonna pass it on
so someone else can love it cuz I don't
think I've ever used it I mean look at
that it's so beautiful though but I just
it needs to be somewhere where it's
being used poor thing
this is the eternal sunshine that's what
it's called Anne this is another one it
reminds me of half baked it's I swear a
dupe for that so I love it I will
continue to use it this one is is used a
lot by me this one it's so pretty as
well as liquid diamond and it was sent
to me by a sweet subscriber and it's
gorgeous I mean I can't stress that
enough
how beautiful it is but again I'm just
not ever reaching for it and it breaks
our heart because it should be loved
look at how gorgeous that is see that
makes me want to use it see this makes
me want to use it which is a good thing
I mean it should be used but I also know
that I never reach for it I'm just gonna
pass it on I can't keep holding on to
things that I'm never using it's
beautiful though okay next thing this is
a Maybelline Color tattoo pigment and
it's in the shade barely brazen Wow and
it's again just like the Stila kitten
really really beautiful I love it this
one is a lot more finely milled however
then the L'Oreal one but they're both
beautiful in their own way this one is a
little more warmer and this is a little
more cooler toned but they're very very
similar and both beautiful so I'm gonna
keep this one Isabella Pierre now you
guys know I love their lip gloss this is
in gold brown or Goldy brown or gold and
brown and it's this really really cool
like duochrome
I want to swatch this you guys can see
what I mean it's got like the green but
then also like the brown I don't really
know it's called golden brown but you
almost see like green in it but I'm
never using it like ever there's no
point in keeping it so I'm gonna pass it
on dust everywhere okay this is the Mac
pigment and tan that my friend amber
sent me a long time ago and it is
stunning it's amazing because it looks
crazy dark but then when you actually
like apply it it's this like beautiful
it really looks like amber rush oh yeah
it is absolutely stunning I want to get
like the full size of this because
although I don't use pigments all the
time I use this one a lot and I'm
running low and I also want to try the
Mac vanilla pigment so the tan pigment
in vanilla I think are just beautiful
and yes so definitely keeping that this
is a star looks glitter I realized when
I was wanting to do fun makeup for New
Year's Eve that I
really don't have a lot of glitter and
buy a lot I mean I have like no
straight-up glitter this one however is
like this crazy color let's see yeah wow
it's beautiful though oh my gosh so oh
my gosh wow I mean wow
that is unbelievable so definitely
keeping that I never used it I wish I
would have pulled that out for New
Year's because it's got that pink and
that gold oh my gosh
wow I am just astounded and the
packaging is really really smart I love
that it's got that little dropper I mean
this is absolutely genius my biggest
problem with glitters I experienced was
with the NYX ones that are small and the
packaging doesn't have that like raised
thing so you're not getting so every
time you open it you'd get glitter
everywhere so I love this packaging so
I'm gonna go ahead and keep that out oh
my gosh okay moving forward over here
I've got my like primers for the most
part and I don't use primers all that
often because I usually just use a cream
shadow but I do use them from time to
time so this is the Mac prep and prime
and it's like a you know almost like a
cream concealer ish type thing almost
like a cream shadow really but it's
really really yellow tinted it's in the
shade light I just don't ever use it I
think I'm just gonna pass it on because
I don't it works just fine but I just
don't ever use it this is the lorac
behind the scenes eye primer I've never
used I probably never will use I'm just
gonna pass on this is the terena
Tarantino doll skin eye primer it's got
a doe foot applicator again a really
yellow toned primer and there's nothing
wrong with it but I just don't ever use
it I love the packaging I think it's so
cute but again I just don't ever use it
now I've got two of the Too Faced shadow
insurance I have a small one and then a
full-sized one
and when I was thinking about doing is
just keeping the full-size one and
getting rid of the small cuz I don't
need both and I don't think I'll go
through it fast enough to need both but
since I actually paid for the big one I
think I'm gonna keep that and get rid of
the small one so that would be good okay
this the only one I'm keeping so far
this is a wet and wild by Fergie one
it's really good you guys it's like
freaking glue seriously this would be
good actually with glitter it's almost
like a glitter glue I mean there's no
glitter in it you guys know what I'm
saying it is really amazing and it's
really inexpensive so that is one I
would recommend if you're wanting a
cheap one it's amazing so keeping those
two this is an elf one that I've raved
about it's their eye primer and liner
sealer duo and it's got this part here
that's almost like a creamy concealer II
base but when you blend I know it looks
really yellow but when you blend it in
it gets rid of any discoloration it
holds onto your shadow and then this
side is a like liquid that you can dip
this into shadow and turn that I shadow
into a liner it is really really really
cool I need to get a new one clearly
because this is almost gone and you just
saw the liner brush is looking pretty
rancid too so I think I'm gonna keep it
until I get a new one but I need to add
that like to my shopping list these over
here these are full-size bear mineral
things that I got from Ipsy and then
this is a tiny one the tiny one I never
used the bare minerals cream shadow
thing I'm just gonna pass on these I
want to look at and decide if I want to
keep this is a bare minerals 5 and 1 BB
advanced performance cream eyeshadow
this is in delicate Moss and it's the
full size I feel like I should use this
so delicate Moss wow it's like a really
cool taupe but it's like a matte taupe
that's like a color I actually would use
in a crease how does it blend its it
feels really good blending it almost
blends out completely but again that'd
be a beautiful buffer color on your lid
well I feel like it just blended away
though don't you
maybe you have to let it dry I don't
know so let me think about that I want
to compare it to this one this is an
elegant taupe yeah oh this one is just a
little bit darker those are very very
similar don't you think but this is a
little bit darker gosh these are really
cool
I want to like wait till it dries a
little bit but I like that it is
blendable so you could blend out the
outsides of it you know to make it look
a little softer I think I'm gonna keep
them I think these are really really
cool I just need to make sure that I use
them I can't believe I got those for
free what is really cool that's one
thing I have to say about it see they
like if you have points for reviewing
products on their site or for referring
friends they will have really amazing
free things you can trade them in now
sometimes they're really crappy but
other times they're like full-size
products like that and that was pretty
darn cool okay so let's go through and
see what we're keeping and what we're
getting rid of and see how I did okay so
looking at it now these are all of the
things that I'm keeping and back here of
course I've got my ELF and my Mac Paint
Pots on my two mary kay and then these
are all the things I'm getting rid of I
think I did a pretty good job
yes I've still got a lot but I am a
beauty vlogger and this is you know one
of my jobs so makes sense to still have
a good amount but I feel better about
getting rid of things that really just
weren't being used at all either I
already have one that I like in the same
color or they were just brand new and I
never touched him like this lorac ones
brand new I don't even know that I've
used this shadow insurance but I'm glad
to not have two of them now I just have
one and the hardest one for me to get
rid of there were a few hard ones but
the Mac one is hard getting rid of
anything Mac for me is hard because all
my life I had wanted Mac products and so
now that I have a decent amount of them
it's hard for me to let go so you know
it sounds silly but you guys know how it
is if it's expensive it's hard to let go
of the really nice things these were
hard to let go of as well all of them
were
but I feel better if you're interested
in seeing my other declutter videos I'll
put the link below if you want to start
at the very beginning and the first
video and just work your way through all
of them there are a ton and there are a
ton more coming so definitely subscribe
if you're interested in all of those and
I'll catch you guys in the next one bye
hey guys it's Jessica and today I'm
bringing you a review of the entire wet
and wild cover all line everything

primer the foundation and the concealer

face so you can see how they look

things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
