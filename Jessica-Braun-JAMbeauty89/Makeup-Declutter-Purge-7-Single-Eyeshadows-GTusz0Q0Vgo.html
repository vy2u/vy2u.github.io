single shadows now you'll notice some of
these are like in palettes but they're
all singles on their own for the most
part so that's why I've included them in
this video in a separate video I'm gonna
do my palettes and quads and all those
kinds of things so that is coming single
shadows let's just dig right in so this
is a matte quad I have an in it I've got
an elf shadow in I think this is in
wheat and that is in satin taupe I
cannot remember what that shadow is that
I'm definitely gonna keep this one I
mean I figure I might as well keep
because I clearly like it it's a
beautiful it's an elf one like I said
and it's just like a muted gold and I
think that's so beautiful
it just of course it's not really
showing either to swatch but I love it
so what I need to do is consolidate all
of these either into my big pallet or
something because I hate that I've just
got two random ones in here and nothing
else so definitely gonna keep these two
are definite keepers they're in this duo
because I travel with them almost every
time Tyler and I go anywhere this is max
Omega and this is Mac rice paper I love
them both literally to death looks like
I'm about to hit pan on rice paper I
love it so definitely keeping those but
again I need to consolidate them Charles
of the Ritz this is such an amazing
shadow it's been discontinued probably
for like a decade I got it on some
random discount site this is in the
shade sand dancing and it is the most
beautiful taupe shadow and it's kind of
nostalgic for me now cuz I've had of her
not I mean probably only like two or
three years maybe four but I got it when
I first started watching YouTube videos
just because I was wanting to expand my
collection I found some I wish I could
remember what site it was but I just
loved it and it's very old-school
Hollywood in my opinion so I really I
love I'm definitely thinking about okay
the next one this is the star look
single in tan glow and it's this really
pretty tan color but I never
probably because I have a thousand
shadows plus I want to compare this to
some other ones I've got half baked and
I have this in my palettes yeah those
are different half picked just that is a
definite keeper I bought it as a single
as well just so I could travel with it
without having to bring one of my naked
palettes because it's in both the naked
one and two for a good reason it is most
beautiful shadow ever so definitely
keeping that this Sigma single they sent
me again when I first became an
affiliate sin no true Dom and it's a
really pretty pretty shadow isn't that
pretty but I feel like with singles I
never reach for them but I don't think
that I have a single in this type of a
shade and it's really good to travel
with to add that like little bit of
deeper dimension without going too crazy
so I'm gonna keep that one next one hmm
this is a Nick single shadow and
Flamingo and this is one I've had for a
very very long time I think was my first
Nick shadow I ever purchased and it's
just a really pretty simple color I use
it a lot even today so I'm definitely
gonna keep that one this one is an
Elizabeth Mott shadow and it's in pop
goes the shadow and it keeps popping and
breaking but it's a really really really
pretty kind of reminds me again of Stila
kitten but I don't really need any more
of these so I think I'm just gonna pass
it on okay this Milani single shadow
it's in their older packaging it's
really really pretty it's a no five
clover oh my gosh
isn't that beautiful I think I just got
to keep it it's so pretty
- pretty okay
speaking of Cielo kitten here it is in
all its glory
broken it broke like within the first
few days and that's the problem I don't
the packaging just broke and then like
this is so soft and buttery that it
breaks so easily so I've had to repress
this like a thousand times but it is
unlike anything other than like the
pigments I showed in my last video I
showed that there's a amazing dupe for
this that's really cheap so if you want
to I think it's in my cream shadow and
pigments or whatever video where I talk
about the dupe for this but it is
beautiful of course we picked up this oh
my gosh this is a nick shadow and SOS
and it is the most beautiful simple
crease color that's like more of a gray
taupe love it use it all the time
definitely keeping that this is a be a
bombshell one and it's just a really
simple matte cream color but I use it
all the time to blend all my shadows
together this is a great one a lot of
palettes don't have a color like this so
if you're traveling with a palette this
is a great one to throw in your makeup
bag with it just to be able to blend
everything together with the matte color
so love that this is in the shade
birthday suit okay this this I just
recently got it to Kevin a Quan shadow
and it's in 107 stone and it's again a
beautiful blending color for your crease
a good buffer color actually you know
what I might get rid of the Charles of
the Ritz one because it is getting
really old and while I love that it's
nostalgic these are basically the same
colors so I'm gonna get rid of it okay
so now I'm onto my Mac shadows these are
all new to me I just don't think I can
bear to part with any of them yet cuz I
just got them within the past like month
or two so what I do think I want to do
is D pot these because I feel like I'm
never using them because they're all
it's kind of hard to see the color and
even if I'm doing this like I don't know
I'm just never using them and they're
amazing so what I need to do is to pot
them and put them into this bigger
palette so they're all kind of together
so I think that is something I'm going
to work on and then I'm gonna have a lot
less I mean this takes up a pretty big
chunk of room and I won't have to worry
about that then so I'm not going to get
rid of these I'll show you which ones I
have though patina which is a favorite
of mine it's like an olivey kind of
golden color beautiful floof which is
this amazing kind of iridescent white
type of shimmery color i've got soft
brown which I'm finding that I don't use
as much because it is so orange tinted
which on my fair skin really
not look great this is quark which I
like better than soft Brown I think it's
a better option for if you have fair
skinned wedge which again is fantastic
and then all that glitters of course
keeping all of those in here I've got
these are not all Mac shadows
I've got a lot of elf actually and some
benefit so you know what I don't think I
have any Mac shadows in here right now I
think I took them all out this is an elf
one this one this one this one and this
one are from a benefit like neutralized
palette that was in like a you know like
they're kind of cardboard packaging and
so i depotted them from that and put
them in here but they actually don't fit
so I had to put like sticky tack behind
them to stick in here but I think I
might just get rid of those well I'm
definitely gonna get rid of these
because I've never even used them if you
look I don't even think I just watched
these two colors so I am gonna get rid
of those this one I actually use a lot
and this one I like as well it reminds
me of rice paper so I think I'll keep
those to benefit and get rid of these
this one this one this one and this one
so all the rest of them are all elf and
I love them so I think I might take all
the ones from here
and put them in here get rid of those
few benefit ones and deep pop my others
and I think that will fill my pallet
perfectly I also need to clean my palate
up it looks a mess but I'm gonna be
excited to have all of them together
because it's been kind of everything's
been in different spots for a long time
and it's driving me nuts oh so I'm gonna
work on getting these out and putting
them with my pile of get rid of stuff so
I said look at how little I'm getting
rid of when it comes to single shadows
I'm a little disheartened and I feel
like I should get rid of more so I kind
of looked through in this Milani one I'm
gonna get rid of because I already have
an agreeing just like it there and it's
an elf one that I love and have loved
for a long time so I'm going to pass
this on to someone that will love it as
well I'm so torn
I love all of these it's really really
hard these are all like holy grails
which is why over the years I haven't
gotten rid of any the only ones I'm
thinking of are these two here because
the Sigma one see I don't think I have
another single in this color I don't
know that I have anything in this color
for that matter so I don't want to get
rid of that one yet the next one I
haven't been reaching for as much lately
because I have so many freaking colors
so I think I might pass this one on as
well I don't know let me swatch it one
more time it's such a pretty simple
color it doesn't really swatch much but
I I think I'm gonna keep it I love it
too much and I guess there's no shame in
that I mean I'm still getting rid of
some and at the end of the day I think
what is gonna be really great is when I
get rid of some palettes because single
shadows I have found that I've been
using a lot more because like I said a
lot of them are great to add to a pallet
so I might be using a pallet but I
usually need one or two colors that just
aren't in that palette so I actually use
these a good amount and I feel like once
I do pot those Mac ones and put them in
here it's going to be a lot less you
know it'll all be together so I think
that's really gonna be helpful I did end
up getting rid of one more of the
benefit shadows from my palette that way
once I do pot these six they'll fit
perfectly I've got six more spots in
that so feeling pretty good about this
excited to go through my palettes and
quads though I think that's going to be
really great
