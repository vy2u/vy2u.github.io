a bunch of products I bought at Sephora
in the sales section so right after the
holidays just before I left on vacation
I was realizing that there was a lot on
sale and I found out because I added a
bunch of these items to a wishlist I had
on shop Tager now this video is
sponsored by shop tagger I've worked
with them in the past I love this
company and I love the idea of this so
shop tiger basically is like an online
kind of list creating wishlist kind of
an app you can download it I've got a
link below if you're interested but what
I do is I create a wishlist on there and
I used to keep my list like in my notes
on my phone but then any time I was like
oh maybe I'll go buy that I would have
to go to Sephora and type it in which I
know takes a few seconds but the reason
shop tiger is amazing is because now
I've got a lot of my wish lists on there
and any time something that I had
already had my eye on goes on sale or
anything like that they notify me so
I'll get a notification from them like
hey this product is now on sale and then
I can just click it and go straight to
the site so for example Sephora so a
couple of the items that had my eye on
I'd been notified they were on sale I'm
like this is so perfect then as I
started scrolling through the sales
section I was like holy moly they also
will give you an alert when like if
something's out of stock and you're
adding it to your wish list they'll
alert you when it's back in stock if you
want them to which is really cool
because I feel like there's so many
things that are really hyped up on
YouTube and then they sell out I'm like
dang it so I add it to that wish list
and then I'll get an email like the day
it's back in stock that's pretty cool
like I said if you are interested in
shop Tiger definitely check out the link
below to download it and it's something
that was new to me in 2017 and I'm so
glad I discovered it because it really
really is so neat I know aundrea matza
Lian oh if you watch her I know she
really likes shop tiger as well and
actually I think that's who I heard of
it from and what when I originally
downloaded it anyway so let's go ahead
and get into these sale items I found
I'm excited coz I actually haven't
broken into this yet I got my package
then I went on vacation when I came back
I'm like oh my gosh all the new stuff
first thing I found was this makeup
forever palette so it's their lustrous
shadow palette and I'll put the sale
price I found it for and if it's still
available of course I will link that
below as well
this is their lustrous shadow palette
and it says on the back like the names
of all their shades make it forever
always they don't give names to the
shades it's like a letter and a number
but I loved it because it was mostly
matte and I loved these shimmers and
frankly I feel like I've not tried oh my
gosh a lot of makeup forever shadows and
I feel like I should know a little bit
more about them whoa these are really
like a thin consistency like that was
surprisingly thin but they're like still
pigmented that's weird
cool but weird so if you almost feel
like this can come out of the packaging
it's like a foam like insert which I
don't know how I feel about that I think
the packaging is kind of cool it's very
like makeup artist industrially you know
but let's swatch some of the mats they
had a nice mix of like colors I'd
actually wear and like little pops of
color but nothing too crazy oh my gosh
okay so the mats are really nice I think
that light brown maybe wasn't quite as
pigmented but I'm excited to give it a
try again I'll give you my thoughts I
always do haul update so stay tuned for
a month or two from now I'll definitely
do a haul update on this stuff and let
you know if it was worth buying if I
ended up liking it after trying it for a
while another thing I got was the Z
palette it was on sale really I just
liked it because it was glittery I
bought the rose gold one a long time ago
and I kind of wanted a matching one but
this was more of like a dark color and I
thought that was so beautiful so very
excited to see this was on sale cuz I
just loved literally just looking at it
on the website I was like oh my gosh and
then I think I can get rid of some of my
other palettes that I have and just kind
of condense down so I picked up some of
these because I was so curious and these
were on sale the Lancome matte shakers
I have 272 energy peach cherry liter and
I like to mob it I've not tried these
I'm excited let's start with energy
peach so I'm not even sure Hut so you
shake it up is that right says it's got
a second skin matte finish for wear and
comfort and comfort oh yeah you it's
like a little sponge
I remember seeing pictures but I never
really like watch a video
someone was applying it so I never
really found out how it actually works
um so yeah it just gets it on the sofas
are I wonder why this is the format they
chose but it's definitely like a
kool-aid stained kind of a look to it
you know doesn't seem to have a super
strong smell so that's energy peach
let's try I like to move it oh that
color is so pretty can I get this to
work like what's going on you have to
like twist it I can't get this to show
beyond just like this tiny little bit
just needed to get started but again
it's kind of that same like like
clearish color so interesting I'm
intrigued to try these I kind of wish I
hadn't bought three of them um hope I
should have just bought one Jessica
whoa but then the red is like so maybe
these are just getting started because
the red one was crazy pigmented so I'm
gonna have to keep messing with these
and see like the peach one maybe once I
shake them even more and more and more
if they'll then be as pigmented as like
that red one because there'd be no
reason why one of them would be this
pigmented and the other ones wouldn't
you know alright I picked up these bite
high pigment lip pencils these were on
sale this is one of the items I got
alerted about because they were on my
wish list so I bought three of them I
brought tulip and these are you know
really you know kind of medium sized
pencil not super large they seemed like
a moisturizing kind of a lip color which
I like but not so much eyes and they
roll right off so this is the shade a
maroon that's a really pretty deep pink
I love that shade kind of almost berry
like pink and this one's called velvet
it's a lot more of a brighter pink so
I'm excited to give those a try I do
like pencils like this just because I
feel like you can line and fill your
lips really quickly with them um whereas
with the lipstick you can't always you
know get a precise line and with just a
lip line are you using a lot of it to
fill in your lips so this kind of meets
that in the middle and does both and I
think that's pretty cool and bite I like
their lip sticks that I've tried they're
amuse-bouche lipsticks those are nice
are they my favorite super formula no
but I do still like them but I find
myself
reform because they're made of food
great ingredients and I feel like it's
somewhat good for my lips you know what
I mean it doesn't necessarily dry them
out which I really like I also got some
things from Becca that were on sale the
shimmery skin shimmering skin perfector
why can't I say this shimmering skin
perfecter poured cream and champagne pop
I've actually never tried any of the
champagne pop collection not really for
any reason I just it was never on my
radar when I was actually buying stuff
or like there were just other things I
wanted more so I can't get this there we
go
this is more of a cream highlight I've
had one of their poured things before
and I remember not loving it but I
really just wanted to try this color so
it's like well maybe I'll like it now I
mean that was years ago and now I'm way
more into cream products more than I was
then so I wanted to kind of see have my
feelings changed on this formula it's
definitely a want to say thin and thick
it's like hard to get going but then
it's not a super opaque look in the end
which I don't mind I actually kind of
like that so I'm excited to try that and
that was on sale and then I also got the
Becca liquid crystal lip topper glow
gloss in Champagne dream and Bellini
it's a lot of different colors so oh my
gosh
it's so pretty to look at yeah it's just
super just glittery it's kind of a
peachy glittery color now what's funny
is I actually am wearing a color kind of
similar this today so I put on the
colourpop lip liner in bound my like
favorite and I pretty much filled my
lips in with it but then I put on top of
it the colour-pop ultra glossy lip and
charming
I didn't realize they're both colorful
not sponsored I don't have a discount
code or anything but yeah so it's just
kind of funny so that's a really nice
trick using a gloss like this on top of
a more pigmented color it just kind of
brings some life to them but this is
even more glittery so I am really
excited to give this a try that's really
pretty
so I also picked up they had some killer
samples when I was checking out online
oh wait I have one more product
this is the oh yeah the Sephora sheer
genius eyebrow trimmer so it's like
scissor like but it's got a comb on one
part of the scissor and the other side
is like the actual shear and so you kind
of brush it up and snip I'm like scared
and excited to use it because I usually
just use a separate spoolie and then
scissors to kind of trim my brow hairs
when I need to but I was kind of
intrigued and it was on sale so I was
like but so the perks I think this will
be a two hundred fifty point perk
my favorite the origins original skin
cleansing makeup removing jelly and then
also their mat moisturizer I love both
of these products and I'm excited to
have them in trial size I also got this
for Tyler this was the Jack Black turbo
wash cleanser I'm gonna give to him to
have in his travel drawer I know he's
tried a few Jack Black Protestants like
them
I got another sample of the Sunday Riley
good jeans I still have not bought it
yet I keep buying smaller sizes this
stuff is freaking amazing so I'm excited
to even have this I will use every drop
up because like a 1 ounce container it's
like a hundred and five dollars I'm like
I will keep getting samples till one day
I crack and I inevitably buy it and then
I also got a sample of the Beca first
light priming filter I know like
kathleenlights freaking loves this stuff
I think it was in like her year-end
favorites and I heard kind of mixed
things about this so I wanted to try
it's just a squeezy tube and I'm like
honestly that's probably as much as I'd
use unless I absolutely loved it in
which case I feel like I should make
myself finish this before I buy it
because I have so many primers but Allah
I am excited to try it because she's
certainly given it rave reviews and now
I want to kind of swatch it so it's
definitely got cheese I hate how they
feel full and then really they're not
it's definitely got a purple tint to it
um feels like a lotion kind of reminds
me of the feel of the Smashbox primer
Iser ooh it definitely has a globe to it
that it was actually surprising I kind
of thought it might be gimmicky but
there's definitely like a brightening
quality to that so excited to try that
as well I probably will go through that
since it's like mostly empty don't you
hate that with samples that bothers me
so those are all the things I found that
in the sales section of support like I
said now all of these might still be
available I don't know because it was a
few weeks that I found them but they
have if you've never gone through the
sales section on Sephora site
be ready to get lost because like I'll
do it like price low too high like to
filter it and go through that way and
once I hit a certain price point I'm
like alright I'm good like even if it's
on sale I probably shouldn't buy it if
it's like $40 so you know what I mean
but it's a great way to find some maybe
new products and of course sometimes
there's a reason they're on sale like
maybe they're not very good or just that
people just weren't buying it like no
one really knew about it or it could be
this limited edition and that's a great
way to scoop up some if you're in need
of a highlighter or whatever so
definitely check out shop tagger like I
said the link is below if you're
interested in trying it out and kind of
creating your own virtual wishlist and
being alerted when things go on sale or
if something's out of stock and it
becomes back in stock they'll also alert
you then other than that I hope that
you'll subscribe and I'll see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
