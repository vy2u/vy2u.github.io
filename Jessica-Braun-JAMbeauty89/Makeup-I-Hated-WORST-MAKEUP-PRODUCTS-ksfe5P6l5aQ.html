going to talk about some products that I
did not love and I don't do these very
often I don't even know if I've done
more than one on my channel since I
started it
if I can find any that I've done any
like products I regret buying tight
videos I'll link them below but in this
video I'm going to talk about products
that I don't 100% regret buying because
some of them they were sent to me or you
know however I acquired them doesn't
really matter the reality is that
they're products that I did not love
that I'm just I kind of was just
disappointed in so let's go ahead and
get into it so the very first one is
gonna be really controversial and if you
love this blush girl good for you
because for whatever reason I could not
make it work and it is the benefit
rockateur our blush I bought this it
actually is a special story I bought it
on the way to San Diego to visit my
brother out there with my best friend
Sarah I found one of those benefit
little like vending machines and things
that I was so excited I think I even
post on Instagram about it this was a
couple months ago anyway so I bought
this cuz I was just so I'd heard great
things it smells really good it's a
beautiful like peachy toned blush but
there's some sort of weird shimmer to it
like almost like a purplish shimmer when
it's on my skin I don't really know how
to explain it but it does not look right
on my skin and no matter what I do it
looks patchy no matter what primer I'm
using what foundation it doesn't seem to
matter so I am so sad that this doesn't
work for me and I'm kind of I'm not big
on collecting makeup in fact I've got a
lot of declutter videos on my channel
and I've got another recent one coming
up but I just I love collecting the
benefit box blushes cuz they're so cute
there's something about them that I love
so I have a lot of them and so part of
me the collector and me wants to keep
this but the makeup lover and me says
goodbye because it's so does not work
for my skin so I don't know if I'm going
or not but I do know that I wouldn't
recommend it if you have a skin tone
similar to mine the next thing another
face product that was so disappointed in
is the nyx matte bronzer and this is in
the shade light if you saw my most
recent Ulta haul I've hauled a ton of
makeup a ton and a lot of it was NYX
because I just felt like I hadn't really
tried a lot of NYX for some reason this
eye I don't I don't like it now there's
two ways you could use this this is of
course meant to be a matte bronzer but
it's like a pinkish now almost like a
peach colored light almost oranjee peach
and so much so that I would almost
recommend that you use it as a blush
because it's so not a bronzer color I
don't know who could use this as a
bronzer because it's such a specific
color now it would be a beautiful blush
and I haven't really tried it that way
so I might try and make it work that way
but as a bronzer I don't see how this
could work for anyone because it is so
so orange and on top of that it's like a
light orange so even if you did have
more of an I don't know an orange
complexion if you will this might be too
light for you so it still wouldn't work
so I don't know how this I don't know I
let me know if you liked this and how
you're using it because it confuses me
the next product I regretted buying is
one that makes me kind of sad it's a
flower beauty product and I only own a
few products from them and it's one of
their I guess it's their lip glosses but
it's the ones that have the black lid
and the shade is pink about me adorable
right now this smells so strongly of a
floral scent it makes me think of my
grandmother which is not a bad thing but
it's one that it's almost so strong that
it makes me feel nauseated but look how
pretty the color is it's this beautiful
light salmon pink color it makes you
think of the NARS lip gloss and Turkish
Delight oh no it's a little more salmon
now the flower one's a little bit more
opaque oh yeah I know they're not really
similar at all the Turkish Delight wants
a lot more pink anyway but the smell
just tells me I can't do it it makes me
sad because the packaging is adorable
it's a nice lip gloss but it makes me
so sick to my stomach I never ever reach
for this so pretty sure I'm gonna pass
this one on to maybe a sister might just
toss it I don't know I don't know it's
pretty strong anyway the next regret is
another lip product this is the Revlon
Colorstay ultimate suede lipstick now
this is the shade socialite and it's
again a nice kind of peachy pink color
but when I heard the term old ultimate
suede I don't know for some reason I was
picturing something a little more matte
like pretty opaque I was totally wrong I
was totally wrong it's more of like a
sheer wash of color and that's after
like four swipes here I'll show you what
one swatch looks like right there so
it's kind of just patchy it's just
patchy now some people might like that
you know for certain days I don't
necessarily need a full opaque color but
I just wasn't impressed with the way
this warm like when I put it on like I
swear five minutes later it's just
patchy and nothing was even and but it
wasn't glossy enough to just look like a
nice glossy finish it was just right in
between but not in a good way so I do
not have any desired by any other color
and this one I'm definitely getting rid
of because I just won't use it I used it
the one time and I was like I can't I
can't I've got too many other great
products I could be using another
disappointing one is the elf mascara
primer I tried this so many times and
you guys know I love elf but it's I
think it's supposed to be like I don't
really know cause it's not like fibers
in there that you're putting on like
some of the mascara type priming
products have but it doesn't really do
anything it just ends up making my
lashes clump at the end of it and you
know I've tried to let him dry long
enough before I put on the mascara but
they still look weird and it just didn't
really do anything for me so this is
almost something that I I mean I would
never repurchase I would never recommend
I would say if you're wanting a primer
like to separate your lashes before you
put on another one that's not fiber like
this is
fibers either I would say just get one
of those like the Nick skinny mascara
you guys know I like or the Maybelline
lash discovery anything that's got those
really thin bristles that you can really
get in there to kind of make it darker
there that's what I would recommend
because this is not really serving any
purpose for me the next regret that I
also recently got during I also recently
got this next regret in my latest Ulta
haul this is the essence all about nude
eyeshadow now I've never tried essence
eyeshadows like little palettes that
they have I've never tried those before
I've tried some other singles and
they're pretty good so I had high hopes
for this and I thought the colors were
so pretty when i swatched him i think in
the video I haven't rewatched it and it
was a while ago I think I was impressed
with some of them so i swatched a few
and I'm like oh wow like that's not bad
the red one I'm like mmm that one's kind
of patchy this one hardly shows up at
all so as i'm swatching these after the
video like when i was trying to use it
the next day i was like ok two of these
are really really good the rest of them
are absolutely terrible so you can kind
of see them they're like there's this
darker one and this lighter white one
that's beautiful and they're really
buttery when you touch it but the rest
of them are so like Halloween makeup bad
you know the type that you buy when
you're like 9 to do like Halloween
makeup and it's like $1 for the whole
palette that kind of really bad eye
shadow that's what I'm talking about
just really not impressed you can get
wet and wild ones that where most of the
palette is all creamy and buttery so not
impressed with this now of course like I
said some of them were good and I think
they're single shadows from what I
remember those are pretty good too so I
think it's just kind of hit or miss with
essence eye shadows but hmm I'm probably
gonna pass this one on and laughs yes
the last product is this NYX baked blush
I've talked about this before on my
channel I think I mentioned this was a
dud okay
the packaging is adorable got a little
bow you open it it's there baked blush
plus illuminator plus bronzer which
again I don't get because it's just a
pink color but so be it it's in the
shade Spanish rose and it's got this
glittery
very finished to it very frosty really
and when you swatch out on your finger I
think it is absolutely a beautiful pink
but when you put it on your skin it's
gone and even if you build it up with a
brush you know over and over again you
can get a little bit but I swear after
like 30 minutes it's completely gone and
I was thinking I'm like you know I've
tried so many blushes over the years and
this is one of the very few blushes I've
tried where it's just gone I'm like I
just wasted my time in my money you know
time putting it on when it was gone so
quickly why even put it on and money it
was like five bucks I could have spent
on something else so total dud I don't
know about the other shade I've heard a
few people say they love these like
maybe it's like a blush topper I can
absolutely see that being beautiful
because it does have a nice shimmery
finish and I feel like when the color is
gone it does leave a little shimmer
behind which could really just be those
flecks of glitter that are in it which I
don't love so just not that impressed
some people have said the other shades
are similar as well I don't know I'm
definitely not going to repurchase any
other ones of these but I will say the
NYX HD blushes are amazing any really
any of their other blushes are
incredible they stay on all day they're
around the same price so if you are
looking for blushes or NYX flushes in
particular look at their other ones not
the baked ones because those just don't
seem to be as good so those are all of
the products that I was kind of
disappointed in lately let me know what
you've been disappointed in so that I
don't go out and buy them and so that
everyone else that might be reading the
comments don't also go out and buy them
keep in mind that we all have different
skin types skin tones skin problems you
know whatever so that's one thing to
always keep in mind when we're talking
about products that don't work for us
that might work wonderfully for someone
else so hopefully you enjoyed this video
