going to share with you guys what the
makeup that I teach in my classroom I am
a teacher
so this is the makeup that I keep at
work now I will say it I don't want to
say very rare but I don't touch up my
makeup every single day I feel like I
finally found products that I don't need
to touch up throughout the day but these
are products that I like enough to keep
there I don't bring them back and forth
but they just stay in my desk or
products that I just used to touch up
that I think are good touch-up products
and also ones that are just good for
everyday no matter what I started the
day with on my face also its
thunderstorm outside which is amazing we
just ordered a pizza and it's just one
of those nights it's so cozy and like
I'm just excited to spend it with my
hubby but I'm also excited to share with
you guys what I have in here so let's go
and get into it so this is actually a
makeup bag that my brother and my future
sister-in-law they're engaged they're
getting married this year they got me
just for Christmas it's from the brand
Kenzie and I think it is the prettiest
makeup bag and I wanted to use I just
flopped from like an old makeup bag I
had like I've had this same makeup bag
for years and years so I'm excited to
have a fresh one and this one is so cute
and so it's one that I would like to see
everyday whereas that one I was so tired
of seeing you know it's kind of dirty
and grimy so let's dig into the bag so
first thing in here is what bomb this is
the most used thing in here it's the
feel Bigelow of my favorite lip balm my
favorite night bomb is what they call it
just a standard lip balm but it's
amazing it's got really moisturizing
ingredients it's smells like vanilla but
not too strongly and it just makes my
lips feel and look amazing so I would
say every single day I'm pulling this
out at least once so you have lip
products the other ones I have are very
natural neutral colors so I have this
toothpaste sweet peach creamy peach oil
lip gloss it's got such a long name and
peach fuzz it's just a traditional lip
gloss honestly there's nothing that's
special about these lip glosses it's not
worth the money I have the whole line
because they gave it to me at the event
but I really like them it's not like I
don't like them and that's why I'm
bringing this but
don't think they're worth going out and
buying just to buy it I think there are
plenty of other losses at the drugstore
you can spend your money on these smell
like peaches are comfortable on the lips
they you know they look they make me
look more put together and so that's why
I like having it at work the other one I
have is a little bit more pinky tone
this is the Loreal line I don't remember
what this is called they don't have it
on here but it's in the shade rose
melody and it's just a little doe foot
applicator a really simple pink lip
gloss really really comfortable I would
say even more comfortable than a
standard lip gloss because it's a little
bit thinner of a consistency but I love
this stuff so much and you know a lot of
these products I put in here are
products that I felt like they weren't
getting enough love here in my
collection but they're ones that are
still really good you know I don't want
to get rid of them but I wanted them to
get some use so that's why they're in
here the only eye shadows I have in here
is this L'Oreal quad honestly the main
reason I put this quad in here is
because it has both shimmery and matte
shades in it this is the quad called
French biscuit but it also has something
to apply it with I didn't want to have
to bring a bunch of brushes because I'm
not sitting there and like doing a whole
makeup look but you know like to find
parent-teacher conferences later that
day or anything like that it's nice to
have something to kind of freshen up
with and I like these shadows a lot
these are really pigmented it's a good
mix of colors this darker one with the
glitter really does have a lot of
Fallout so that's not one I would use it
work but the other three are really nice
neutral shadow so the blush I have in
here this is one that might get switched
out this is this matte blush it's from
the riot Carrie line and it's called
sweet sweet fantasy which is one of her
songs which I actually really do love
I'm bringing it because I don't hate the
blush it's okay it's a little bit
brighter of a color than I would
traditionally wear but it's still a good
blush and I don't just want to get rid
of it but it's one that I'm really not
reaching for much here in my collection
so I'm also bringing a brush with it to
apply this is the face secret brush it
is kind of purplish kind of looks like a
unicorn tail
so that makes sense kind of got like
rainbow fibers within it it's not the
best quality brush of use but it gets
the job done which is why I am bringing
it cuz again I'm not going to be
reapplying blush very often I'm also
bringing this it cosmetics CC cream in
light this is the shade I wear I love
this stuff that I have a full size and
I've been keeping this for travel
purposes but I realized I was like you
know what this is the perfect touch-up
thing because I know I love this formula
and the shade is perfect and it's not
really big so it doesn't take up much
room or anything and it's not getting
used when I'm here because I of course
have the full size that I always grab so
I thought this is so perfect for that
and I love this formula it's got good
coverage makes your skin look healthy
but it also still covers any
imperfections you might have it's really
really good I also in bringing this
Misha Beauty signature essence cushion
and honestly you guys the only reason
I'm bringing this the only reason I
threw it in here is because I have a
couple cushion foundations and I feel
like I'm not getting a lot of use out of
them so I wanted to bring this so that
I'm forced to use it and of course it
has a sponge to apply it with as well so
this is kind of one of those things that
once I use it up I'm not going to
repurchase by any means so I figured
this is a great way to make sure that
I'm using it and it's not that it's bad
but it's also not my favorite so it's
kind of in between there I also in
bringing this OH thermal Avene thermal
spring water this is great for if my
face looks really powdery I could just
spray this on and it just kind of
revives it it adds like a little bit of
hydration um you definitely don't want
to spray on too much because it can look
really really wet but it's just kind of
a nice way to refresh your skin and I
like that but again it's not getting a
lot of used here so I figure if I bring
into work I'm more likely to use it the
concealer I'm bringing is this
maybelline superstay better skin
I like this concealer a lot it's been in
favourites videos before it I would say
probably 3/5 of the way gone so a little
less than half is less but it's a nice
formula it's easy to blend it's
comfortable it doesn't make my skin look
crazy or anything like that and that's
why I like it so I figure this is quick
if I wanted to just dot it on and blend
it in with my
here I wouldn't need a brush for it and
that's why I brought the highlighter I'm
bringing is one that I figured be really
simple to apply this is one of the cover
FX little ones that fits in their CLIC
stic thing they have and it's in the
shade celestial and it's just eight I
mean truly a miniature stick but that's
something that I'm probably never going
to run out of but it's just a really
pearly color it's really creamy so what
I like to do is just take my finger and
rub it on there and just Pat it where
I'd want highlight maybe on the tip of
my nose it just looks really nice and
glowy without looking overpowering and
that's why I really I genuinely like
yeah I draw a pencil I'm bringing is one
I don't use a lot here it's the NYX
micro brow this I actually really like
this pencil it's incredible it's exactly
like the Anastasio on the shade is just
a little off but I don't want to just
get rid of it because it's not that far
off it's just a little warmer than I
would like this is in the shade
chocolate and it really does look like
milk chocolate it's just a little bit
warmer than I typically would wear but
it still gets the job done and if
something happened with my brows or you
know there was a day that I forgot to do
my brows completely because I don't
always do them at the same time in my
makeup routine and the reality is it's
not that they're going to deal but
really I really do look different you
know if you've ever seen me putting on
makeup like and snapchat or anything
like that I really do look different so
a lot of you realized aren't you okay
what you look different than what oh my
gosh so I'll be glad to have that there
in case that has to I'm bringing two
different eyeliners one is a pencil
liner eye liner from Hikari and it
literally does all it says it doesn't
say the shade or anything like that but
the reason I'm bringing it is because
it's a really creamy black liner but
it's also retractable I didn't want to
have to bring a separate sharpener with
it so I figured this is the perfect way
to do that and it's still a really good
formula and again I've got enough in my
collection I don't need this so I figure
it's perfect but I'm also bringing a
liquid liner so if my wing looks weird
or anything like that I have two of
these this is the toothpaste you're so
two-faced sketch marker in black got a
felt tip really pointed it's what I use
every single day and that's
two of them what I'm using right now
this is the other one they have one
that's in like charcoal black and I
don't love that one as much it doesn't
it's not quite as black so this one I
really add the black I would recommend
and then the last thing I'm bringing is
this mascara and honestly I typically
will bring to work on mascara that's
getting older just because you know I
don't want to just throw something away
when I open a new one but it's not quite
bad yet so I figure it's got another
month or two this is the Grande mascara
their lash boosting boosting formula
they sent this to me I tried it for a
while I don't hate it but it's not my
favorite but again like if I needed to
reapply I could just have this toss it
on but in a few months I'll need to put
in another mascara so it kind of rotates
throughout as do some of these things as
they go bad or you know whatever so that
is everything that's in here I mean it I
the only thing that I'm missing is a
powder and the only reason I don't have
a powder in here is I only own like two
or three powders and all three of them I
use all the time like every other day
I'm switching between the three of them
so I need to get another of those three
to bring to work because I don't want to
leave it work because all three of them
I would miss them I had a bareMinerals
one I have my Physicians Formula
youthful wear one and I have my it
cosmetics one and I love them too much
to not have with me every day so kind of
sounds silly I know to have three
powders and not bring one to work but I
think I'm going to buy another of the
Physicians Formula
and bring that one to work so that I
still have one here it is what it is but
and I don't really have any like
lipstick in here I might eventually
visiting it if mr. Teja I'm wearing
lipstick I'll typically just put it in
my purse so then I have it because you
know I've got so many different shades
so that's not always something I'd
necessarily need to leave there if that
makes sense you know other things I
didn't bring like I didn't bring a
primer because I figure there's not
going to be a need where I need a primer
I didn't put a bronzer in here again
that's not something you know it'd be
nice as a touch-up I don't have a lot of
I got rid of a lot and I don't really
feel the need to have that
pull the touch up with so let me know
what you have like if you have something
that you know maybe a bag you leave at
work or somewhere like that let me know
the only other video like this I've done
was where I shared what makeup I was
keeping when I was just dating Tyler
before we got married
makeup that I kept at his place so if
you're interested in that is a couple
years ago I will link it below if I can
find it I mean I'm sure I can find it
but otherwise I hope you kept catch me
on my social media it's right there on
the screen jamb buting 89 and I hope
that you'll subscribe click that
notification bell wherever it is on the
screen
if you look like the Brady Bunch where
they're all like looking at each other
awkward but definitely hit that Bell if
you want to be notified every time I
upload something new I'm in the middle
of the declutter series so I'm uploading
those all the time and that's a great
way to find out what I am loving right
now but also what I'm not loving my that
I I think is maybe not worth it that I'm
getting rid of so I hope to catch you in
my next video and I'll see you guys soon
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
