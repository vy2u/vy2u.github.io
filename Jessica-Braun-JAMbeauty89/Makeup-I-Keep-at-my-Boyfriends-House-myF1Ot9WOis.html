have kind of a different kind of video
for you guys
it is a peek into my makeup bag that I
leave at my boyfriend's house and this
is kind of new to me because I had gosh
we don't live together and so all the
time I'll be like like right now we're
snowed in and like I remember last year
we were snowed in and I was still at his
house so I had no makeup with me and I'm
like now and so um that was an issue and
then everyone smiled like maybe we'll be
over there and we're gonna go out that
night and I want freshen up and put on
some new plush or a new highlight or
darken my eye look and I have nothing
there with me cuz I really don't keep
that much makeup in my purse with me so
um I think I think it's just a good idea
I'm gonna use one of my makeup bags I'll
show you which one I'm using this is a
Marc Jacobs one that I got from Target
lie a year ago last last Christmas when
they did that targeted that thing with
Nordstrom where they had a lot of
designers on design stuff to sell at
Target and this was one of the Marc
Jacobs makeup bags and I love it and I
used to keep it my purse but um I'm
gonna use it for this now because I have
a different makeup bag in my purse now
so um which by the way if you're
interested to see a new what's in my
purse video let me know down below I've
been thinking about doing doing another
one a little bits change not a ton I've
different purse for sure but so let me
know if you're actually interested cuz
I'm kind of on the fence about it but um
anyway using this so we'll go through I
have absolutely everything I could
possibly need for a full-face lots of
things for different looks and things
like that so let's go ahead and dive
right in
so for face I always start with
moisturizer so I figured I would bring
one this is the Ala you love I have no
idea Henriksen truth cream advanced
hydration someone by the way tried to
tell me how to pronounce it in the
comments and they described it well but
I just don't remember so sorry
um anyway I've used it before and I
think the biggest tip I can give to you
and that I it's a tip for myself too
is to bring products whether you're
traveling or for something like this
always bring products that you've used
before because you don't want to bring
foundation you've never used and then
you try it out and then you break out or
just not at all it's just terrible for
your skin and then you realize it
especially if you're traveling and
you're like out and about you can't
really buy a new one you're like oh my
gosh what you know anyway that's just
terrible to happen to me before and it's
terrible and I had a horrible break out
like the entire vacation so every
picture I was like now anyway so that's
what I'm ready from moisturizer I have a
feeling I'm gonna be very blabby in this
video so I apologize ahead of time if
you get annoyed what I'm Blaby but I'm a
pretty Blaby person so okay so for
foundation I'm just gonna bring my
Revlon nearly naked and this is one that
I kind of go back and forth with but
I've never hated it but it's not my
favorite but I like it because it's kind
of light to medium coverage and it's
just really simple and I can apply it
with my fingers I don't have to worry
about bringing a brush I've used it a
million times it's probably down to here
now so I think this is just a great way
to kind of just use up something that
I'm almost done using up I don't know if
I'll repurchase it or not I do like it
and I always end up I end up traveling
with this a lot just because I mean I do
really like it and I just don't realize
I don't know but it is lighter coverage
which I kind of like okay so for
concealer I'm bringing the Neutrogena
healthy skin brightening eye Perfector
and this I don't really like that much
but it's not terrible so the reason I'm
bringing it is so that I'll use it
because when it's in my collection I
look at my concealers and I see a ton of
favorites and then this one I almost
never reach whoa I almost never reach
for it so why not bring it in this and
then I'll actually maybe use this so
it's not bad it has SPF in it it kind of
tingles though and I don't really I like
that sometimes like with an eye like a
moisturizer and under-eye moisturizer
but with concealer I don't know what
kind of freaked me out made my eyes burn
a little bit so but I do want to use it
up so I'm gonna bring it with me okay
oh for primary I probably should already
mentioned this then I'm bringing the
bare minerals prime time it's like a
little deluxe sample size and I love
bringing these for traveling or for
something like this just because you you
that way you use it up now I have so
many of these little things especially
with primers and I never use them
because I use my favorites so but I do
actually like this and again I'm used
for so-so I'm also bringing with me the
elf blotting sheets I've used most of
these up already well I would say I've
got a good amount of them but it's like
$1 for a million and now I'm using my
Palladio ones in my purse so this is a
great way to use these up as well it's
all beat up because it's been in my
purse okay so for powders I'm bringing
one powder foundation just in case I
want to touch up without getting
foundation out and I want a little bit
more coverage I'm bringing my pal audio
dual wet and dry foundation it's just a
powder foundation underneath there's
like a little sponge which is nice so I
can use it with that if I want I'm also
for powders gonna bring this Ecotools
retractable kabuki brush and it just
comes off and then you my friend amber
got it for me but I never reached for it
it's a really really soft nice dense
brush and it's great for traveling
obviously but I don't have it I can't
really fit it in my little brush caddy
on my desk so I just don't use it that
often so this is a great way to make
sure I'm using because it's a really
really nice brush I'm also just for
mattifying purposes bringing my
Maybelline Dream matte powder again I
never reach for it I'm always using my
Rimmel stay matte oh my gosh my nose is
just like crazy Oh anyway it's it's fine
I mean this products fine it's not my
favorite but I like it and it gets the
job done and so this is another way to
make sure I'm using it guys
what is it my nose also is it dumb that
I'm still drinking out of Christmas mugs
and it's like a week into January
basically I don't care it was hard for
me to take down my Christmas tree really
really hard and I saw some people in my
the video I posted like the first time
after I taken it down so people were
like well bye-bye Christmas tree and
that just made me laugh out loud cuz I'm
like I know
makes me sad too but I am a little bit
Christmas doubt but at the same time
Christmas trees are just so happy and
clearly this is my favorite mug I feel
like I've shown it in like 10 videos but
it is awesome also this coffee is cold
how did it get cold so fast
anyway okay so back to what we were
talking about so for blush bronzer and
highlight this is one of my favorite
finds then I got up like three dollars
on clearance
it's the Revlon sculpting blush palette
have it in the shade pink rose and it
just got everything you need in one I'm
not even bringing any other bronzer
highlighter blush because I don't really
need to and I've used this before I like
it they're not the most pigmented things
in the world but they really do have a
nice look especially when you use them
together it's almost like the perfect
glowy look without even looking like
you're wearing makeup I just love it and
it's perfect brush wise I'm bringing
some brushes I just don't reach for as
often that I really like and I want to
use this is the Real Techniques
duo-fiber face brush I'm gonna use this
for blush and I know I need to clean
these lips and then for bronzer I figure
I can use this as the angled blush brush
but it's really dense and I think I'm
gonna use it for contouring I think it'd
be actually really really nice and these
these are like three dollars the elf
ones and then this is an elf mineral
powder brush but it's really small I'm
gonna use that for highlight or if I
needed it for powder as well but I don't
think I will okay so for eyebrows this
was tricky because I always use my
Anasazi a brow powder and it's my
favorite and I just never use anything
else cuz I never found anything else
that works as well
so I figure I'll bring something just in
case though and this is the essence i
brown designer pencil in blonde and I
chose blonde because I really some
people were asking do you ever do your
eyebrows I'm like um everyday sheesh
sheesh no they were saying you should do
your eyebrows I'm like I do but the
thing is I my eyebrows are naturally
really light and I've tried going really
a lot darker with my brows and I just
don't like the way it looks you know
what I mean and to each his own and that
is my own so but I do do them and I do
them with powder and I brush through
them um and I mean that's that but this
I like because it doesn't pull as red as
a lot of pencils do as a lot of anything
does I really like those taupe colors
for my brows so this one works okay
and it's really inexpensive but it's not
it's kind of kind of got a push so I
might have to like heat it up or warm it
up before I use it and then I'm also
bringing the elf um like brow clear gel
stuff again not my favorite it's a
really wet formula but it's okay and it
does it does keep your brows in place
it's just harder to work with and then
I'm also bringing a little elf one
dollar spoolie that they sell I have
more than one of these so I'm just
bringing one of them
and I used my ELF spoolie by the way
every single day for my brows it's
better it's the best bully in the
frickin universe okay so we'll go ahead
and do lips before we do eyes so for lip
balm I'm bringing my Smith's lip balm
and minted rose I love it I got this an
Amish country when we went this year
which was so fun of course you can buy
this like anywhere um but I really
really like it it smells exactly like
mint and Rose combined if you don't like
mint or rose then you would hate it but
if you do like them you'd like it um I
know that I love this and I it's about
half gone but I have other lip balms I'm
using so I figured this would be a great
one to bring um and this is a great one
by the way to put on like when you first
start getting ready just put it on and
then let it sink in by the time you're
done with your makeup
you could put lipstick over it and your
lips are really nice and moisture so you
might have to wipe a little bit of it
off because it is a more wet formula so
for lipstick I'm bringing my Revlon
Super Lustrous lipstick and pink in the
afternoon one of my old favorites it's
just a really simple pink color it's got
a little bit of color but it's not too
bright but it's not too Brown nude I
mean it's oh it really is the perfect
pink I love it I love it I love it and
then for lip gloss I'm just bringing one
my Revlon Super Lustrous lip gloss in
pango peach which is just this really
pretty sparkly peach color you can
really wear it alone you can wear it
over that lipstick or over any lipstick
for that matter and it's just simple
I've only used it a few times so I
figure I need to give it some more love
so okay on to eyes I have a lot of
things a lot of goodies so for eyes I
figure let me wipe off these swatches
I'm gonna be responsible today I always
end up with swatches all over my clothes
by the way I'll get it like on my chin
all swatches on my arm I mean just
everywhere I end up with lipstick in my
hair okay so let's start with well I'll
start with primer the eye primer I'm
using is the elf eyelid primer it's a
dollar I have tons of primers in my
collection but I figured this would be a
great one to bring because if I ever
really missed it I could just go buy it
for a dollar and that way I could have
it in both places but I have plenty so
and I know I like it
for well this is kind of a primer to
sort of it's the covergirl smoky shadow
blast and I like to use this side the
like I don't know
the shade I didn't see it on here but I
like to use this side which is like a
champagne color on my lid it kind of
Prime's the cream shadows do you know
how they roll
they're basically primers with some Cola
and then the brown one the darker brown
one is its I don't use it as often but
it really is pretty sometimes I'll use
it in the crease but you got to blend it
out and I act like blending it out as a
ton of work but you know what I mean so
I don't use it as often but I really do
like that and I wasn't reaching for it
much so I'm bringing it with me
all right so let's do eyes shadow 's
first so one thing I'm bringing okay
you're gonna laugh because I'm bringing
way too many eye shadows but I already
have way too many eye shadows here so I
need to just spread the love you know so
this is the this was free from Sigma M
is when I got brushes a long time ago
way before I was an affiliate and it
came with it just like it's a free gift
and I love it I really this is the shade
publicise this is a command and this is
surrender these two especially I use all
the time this is a good blending color
and this I just love it's such a pretty
gold I want to swatch this one for you I
don't know if it's gonna show up oh I
love that it's so pretty oh my gosh it's
so pretty I want I need to get this in
the single form because they sent me
some single eyeshadow notes or Dom that
I really like it's more like a brown
taupe but this one I need to get in
single in the shape what is it command
it is so pretty you know what it reminds
it reminds me of a it's a little bit uh
no it reminds me of half-baked I don't
think it's coming across it reminds me
of half-baked but a little bit more
understated kind of in a good way now I
love how fake it is my favorite but
command is really pretty too so go
figure I'm also bringing my Physicians
Formula Canyon classic squad and it's a
matte quad I've loved it for a long long
time they're just beautiful beautiful
colors but I wasn't giving it a ton of
love I'll get the white one - why not I
wasn't giving it a ton of love here and
I have plenty of matte shadows in my
palettes that I have and all kinds of
other stuff so I figure I might want
some matte shadows over there so I'm
bringing this and I love it this is like
five bucks at the store and they have
another one I have my eye on called
rose quartet that's really really pretty
like pinks but I don't really wear pink
eyeshadows I know I keep mentioning that
but I really don't know
maybe I shouldn't but I want it I don't
know I don't know okay I'm also bringing
I don't know if I talked about this in a
long time my Unni palette and these I
bought it quite a while ago and they
have a lots of different colors I just
got it in black and there's like glitter
in it like infused in it too which is
pretty you can't really see it though
these are like 25 to 30 dollars kind of
pricey but they're nice they're not a
huge size but they're cute and they're
hard and I got it initially for travel
because it clasps shut which I really
likes and they wouldn't open but it has
a humongous mirror which is great for
getting ready so I can use that for that
but I'm really bringing it because look
at all the stuff in here that I never
use I never use this anymore I have tons
of wet-and-wild shadows I've got like a
blush from I don't even know all
may-maybe maybe I have no idea it's an
older one um more shadows this is a NYX
oh that's a NYX eyebrow one that I could
use I didn't think about that anyway but
I love it it's got a big mirror but I
never reach for because it's kind of
messy and it's like unorganized it kind
of drives me crazy but this would be a
great way I'll have another blush color
way more options when it comes to
shadows so I love that I'm a mess okay
so for liners I have quite a few options
so for just a pencil liner I'm bringing
my Palladio herbal precision eyeliner
and I really like this it's just in
black onyx it's just a black liner this
isn't doing a justice I need to sharpen
it I just made that way too thick but
it's nice and black it's really really
creamy I'm bringing a sharpener this is
the one star look set me in there ah see
I get swatches all over myself um Who am
I kidding I'm learning pajama pants were
you guys curious look you're gonna laugh
aren't these cute though I got them at
t.j.maxx they're like the Cynthia Rowley
brand that's right Cynthia is that right
you'll know what I mean if you know what
I mean duh
okay anyway so I'm bringing this that I
just got eyeliner on my pants there and
I'm bringing the star looks a little
sharpener that they sent in their star
box in November I think so that way I'll
be able to sharpen that and then I've
got a liquid eyeliner I bringing the
Jordana fabula nur I've had this stuff
like a year it was like three bucks and
it hasn't dried out yeah I used to use
it every single day and it's still just
as black as when I first got it is that
doing addresses cuz it's really black I
love it and it's just one of those
felt-tip um so good it is so so good so
so good it really is I might need to get
a second one so I can have it mole
please cuz I really do love this I just
forgot how much I love it
then I'm also bringing a gold kind of
brown liner I use that sometimes on my
lower lash line and this is a Milani one
and Tara Brown it's got glitter in it I
got it at like the dollar store so I
don't even know if you can buy it for
real but it's right there I just think
it's pretty but I have one that I use
all the time here so I figure I'll bring
this one there okay
I am also bright way too many eyeliners
I'm also bringing a cream liner which I
used every day I use joah gel or cream
eyeliner this is the wet wild by Fergie
one it's in little black dress it's just
straight up black I like it it's not my
favorite formula but it's okay it's
better than some and I'm bringing the
elf small tiny tiny it's the small
angled brush I'm bringing to a plant and
then oh I should probably show you my
shadow brush as I'm bringing I'm
bringing this is a Sonia Kashuk one
that's real small for like little detail
I don't know what it's called but it was
in a kit by Sonia Kashuk and then I'm
also bringing the elf it's their
professional concealer brush but I'm
bringing it again for like detailed work
if I want to do anything I just think
it's really nice to have obviously um
I'm also bringing this elf professional
eye shadow brushes all it's called it
doesn't even have a name but it's just
good for packing on lid shadow and then
I'm also bringing this Smashbox travel
crease brush I got once actually like
two years ago but it's great for
blending all your shadows great for
crease just all of it I love it um and
then for mascara I'm bringing now if you
know me and you've been following me on
Instagram you know that I have way too
many mascaras open right now and I'm so
mad at myself because I have like I
don't even want to say the number of
mascaras too many and I'm so mad at
myself because I you
to be really good about opening one
maybe two mascaras at a time because you
have to throw them out after why I know
you can you can rewetting and use them
for a little bit longer but even still
they go bad quicker than most other
products do so I hate having a lot open
and I have way too many but this is what
I did like but I've got open
it's the Revlon lash potion the brush is
nice the packaging is adorable it's in
the shade black and brown and I like it
and I figured this way I will get to use
it up there because I'm never reaching
for it here and then I'm also bringing
my eyelash curler
I just I'm cleaning it right now cuz
it's a mess figure I might as well I'm
bringing this one because I just
recently got the tarte one it is awesome
I meant I talked about it in my everyday
makeup drawer number five my most recent
one um I got it because I got it for
free especially had a coupon and then I
had like rewards dollars I could spend
in Ulta so I got that for free I would I
don't think I would have paid regular
price for it was like 15 or 17 bucks
something ridiculous but it's really
really good but this one's still fine
too it's just some random brand I don't
it's not even Revlon I have no idea but
it still works so I'm gonna bring this
with me so that I can use it there yeah
and I just got lipstick um hey you guys
like my little lights I figure if I've
got to get rid of Christmas I might as
well have something else that I like
over there they're like little pearls
they're like different types of pearls
you probably can't tell but I think
they're cute we'll see how long they
last if they go out then they go out I
don't have any more so it gets off to
remove no anyway alright so I hope that
was enjoyable I know it's kind of a
different kind of video but it was
certainly fun to film and I'm excited
that makeup over there so um yeah if you
do want to see it updated what's in my
purse please let me know down below and
I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
