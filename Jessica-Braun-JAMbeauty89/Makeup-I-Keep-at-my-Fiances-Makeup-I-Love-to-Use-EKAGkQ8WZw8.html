of resurrecting from the dead video i
filmed probably about a year ago that i
called makeup that I keep at my
boyfriend's house and now he is my
fiance so the title will be a bit
different however we don't live together
yet and we well when were married and
we're getting married in June so this is
kind of like the last time I could
possibly do one of these videos because
once they're married then all my makeup
will always be there but there are times
where you know if I'm over like right
now it snowed like a ton right now so if
I had been at his house you know at 10
or 11pm I might not want to drive home
so I would stay the night and I like to
have make up there that way you know if
we actually had something to do the next
morning that i needed a you know to look
decent then I would want my make up
there and I don't really carry any
makeup in my purse with me I used to
carry like tons of stuff and now I
literally carry like a lip gloss that's
about it in chapstick I don't carry
anything with me now because I just
don't touch the up throughout the day
really so um anyway this is a makeup bag
that is from that brand 31 so it is
called an my future mother-in-law bought
this for me for christmas and i love it
and it came with a bag which is where
i'm keeping my brushes that go along
with it and then all my makeups going to
be in here so i'm not going to show you
the brushes cuz really i just grabbed a
blush brush a powder i mean there's not
really any rhyme or reason i just made
sure I had one of each but with these
there is reasons why they are in here
now the idea behind this video is that I
last time I brought a lot of makeup that
I didn't love so when I would have to
get ready over there I'd be like ah like
I'm having to use these products that I
don't care about so this time I was like
I know that I'm gonna miss them from my
collection but I want to have stuff over
there that I enjoy using that way when I
do have to get ready there I can enjoy
it because I've got plenty of products
to go around so these are all products
that I do love and I'm very very excited
to show them to you so this is I'm just
gonna pull and go so they're not going
to be in any order the first thing I'm
bringing is this Mary Kay makeup setting
spray I just filmed a mary-kate review
of it
no and I'm not sure if it's up yet or
what what I'm doing these in but it's
amazing it's by Scandinavia it
absolutely holds on to your makeup all
day but it doesn't make your face look
Gracie it's awesome the next thing I'm
bringing is this again Mary Kay I was
inspired when I made that video because
I realized gosh I really do like these
products I put together my three
favorite shadows and blush from this and
if you're interested in the names I'll
link the video have I said that enough
geez Louise anyway I really like these a
lot and it's nice and compact and
there's a mirror so that is going with
me oh the highlight that I'm bringing is
my mary-lou manizer this one I'm
bringing because I love it and I feel
like it gets lost in my collection I'm
wearing it today and it's so as long as
you use a light hand it's so beautiful
and I just forget about it it really
does get lost in my collection this way
I will use it and after using it today
I'm like ah now I'm going to want to use
it everyday and it's gonna be over there
but I'm excited to have it over there um
the lip balm that I'm bringing is this
malin and gets mojito lip balm I
actually have two of these I got one in
an Ipsy bag and then I got another one
because I wanted another one and it's
just really really nice lip balm even
Tyler's use it and he likes it even
though it looks a little glossy on his
lips so I always laugh anyway it's
really nice and I need to have lip balm
there the oh I'm bringing just one cream
shadow it's this elf smudge pot in ain't
that sweet and I really like this pink
creamy colored base and it stays on all
day these are amazing and furthermore I
have two pink shade ones here so I'm
keeping the mac one here and I'm
bringing the elf one over there okay a
lip gloss and I'm ring and bring you a
couple this is the box um it's like a
miniature one and it's in the shade
dolly and it's kind of a nice kind of
plummy rose color and i love the buxom
lip glosses so i know i've only used
that like once but it'll definitely get
used i'm also bringing the NYX butter
gloss in creme brulee cuz again it's
getting lost in my collection i know
that i love it so i'm gonna bring in
that way i will use it what else the Too
Faced shadow insurance I have two of
these and it's one of my favorites so
I'm just bringing the deluxe size over
there and I've got the full size here
next oh yeah I brought a few random
liners because liners are great and I've
got
ton and I have a lot that are the same
color even after I decluttered I kept
like a few of the blues so I'm bringing
over the Lancome one in turquoise and
it's just a really nice turquoise color
and there's a smudger on the other side
so I could use it on my lower lash line
or really however I want so that will be
nice to have over there the i'm only
bringing one lip liner and this is the
brand is beauty for real that's it and
it doesn't say anything else i think
this is just like the one shade it's
like a universal shade and it is just
kind of like a lighter rose color and it
just kind of works like i warn't today
with this and it's just nice and you can
really use it you could use it with a
dark red or with the lighter color it
just works for all of it so that is why
I'm bringing it because it's universal
I'm bringing the Georgiana fabula nerf
or my liquid liner because i've had this
sucker for like a year and it's souls in
dried out and you can do such a nice
wing with it so i know i will love using
that over there bringing a Beauty
Blender I have a few this is my oldest
one and i recently did that trick where
you put it in a little bit of water and
you microwave it for a certain number of
seconds and it supposedly gets rid of
the germs out if it works it's not that
old but it's my oldest one so i figure
i'll bring it over there I'll use it may
be a few more times and then I might
finally get rid of it um okay oh yes
this is a tart power couple duo and it's
got what are the shades what doesn't say
I think this is doll face and that's
Park Avenue princess I think this is so
beautiful and again it's gotten lost in
my collection because I've got a
thousand of everything including tart
blushes and I'm so excited to bring this
because I will use it and it's so
beautiful I just need to use it so that
keep packaging I'm also bringing my
Jordana best / extreme because I love it
and it's inexpensive so if I start to
miss it over here I could just go buy
one for 399 and it's so awesome the
powder I'm bringing is actually a powder
foundation because I don't really use
powder often the only time i use it is
really if I have like more to cover and
I'll usually reach for a powder
foundation so this is the knicks one and
it's an ivory i think it's the lightest
shade it is a little light for me now
not really I mean once it goes on it
actually works pretty well but I really
like this formula and it'll be nice to
have over there as an option the only
foundation i'm bringing is the wet and
wild coverall which you guys know i just
did a review of the whole cover all line
and these are so cheap there like 399 or
499 the primers really good that I
reviewed and I showed how to apply this
in there and I love this so i know that
i will use it me happy to use it over
there this one again lost in my
collection The Naked basics palette and
it's just so I mean perfect for everyday
and this fills in all the gaps you know
like I could bring a bunch of fun
colored liners and everything but I need
some basics over there and I'm not using
it here so I figured this way I will be
forced to use it because I do like it
what else I'm also bringing Oh Laura
Mercier like setting powder what's it
called the universal invisible loose
setting powder it's just a deluxe size
and I used it to set my concealer and I
used it today actually so I'm bringing
that just to make sure I use it because
I use my bare mineral once all the time
okay i am bringing the star looks liner
eyeliner and chestnut which is just a
really deep brown just to use to like
tight line I usually would use black but
this one's so dark it doesn't really
make a difference and it's I like the
formula so this boy fect bringing a few
lipsticks this is the cover girl one in
eternal which is this really pretty cool
toned blue toned really red and i love
it so much and i wanted to have a bright
one in case we're going out and i want
that for my eyebrows i'm bringing my
honest asya powder because i used my
Anasazi of brow Wiz every single day but
the powder I've also had and I'm not
using it because i love the brow is but
it's still so good and i know that it
matches it's in medium brown and it has
two different colors and then i'm also
bringing my miniature on Nastasia clear
brow gel that i like there's not a ton
left in here but there is a little bit
so i figure i'll use it up over there
what else um Oh gel liner from star
looks ashley hackman you guys know I
love this and a subscriber sent me a sec
one so I'm going to bring that because I
love it I'm bringing for concealer my
maybelline fit me in the shade 10 light
which again you guys know that i love so
much i've been using it like everyday
but i've got so many to use i'm like why
don't I bring this over there so I can
use it there too because I love it and I
think the last thing is my mac lipstick
and cream cup because I got angel and
it's similar here and I use that more so
I'm going to bring cream cup over there
so I can use it over there and like I
said all my brushes are in here I can
kind of give you a peek like I'm
bringing a Sedona laced fan brush to use
for like bronzing and things like that
just some Sonia Kashuk ones like a
powder 1 I am this is actually new to me
this is the Ecotools brush blush brush
and I i really like it but again I've
got so many so I'm going to bring it
over there to use and then oh I'm
bringing a Sigma f80 for for my
foundation and then all my eye brushes
are literally like elf brushes diva
beauty i mean just tons of different
sizes none of these are ones that i will
miss because i do have so many but there
are ones that i do like so i will enjoy
using them so that is convenient and
what's nice is it fits right inside
there with all my makeup and what i will
say what i love about this bag the
pattern is adorable but it stands on its
own and it opens on its own it's got
like wire around it so it's it's really
an ideal makeup bag for travel for
anything but for now that's how i'm
gonna be using it so i know that was
quick and i know that was a lot but i
hope it was fun for you guys to watch I
can link my old video of the makeup guy
used to keep their like a year ago down
below if you're interested and if you
enjoyed please subscribe and I'll catch
you guys on my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
