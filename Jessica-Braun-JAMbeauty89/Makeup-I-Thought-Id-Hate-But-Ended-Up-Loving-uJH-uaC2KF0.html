gonna share with you five products that
I completely they totally took me by
surprise they were products that I
thought I wouldn't like either I thought
they were gimmicky or that they were
just copying something else and they
would be as good whatever the reason and
then in the end I ended up absolutely
loving it so these in the end are five
products I love their favorites of mine
but I just thought this is kind of a fun
fresh video idea and I wanted to share
with you guys tonight so I say tonight
you might be watching it today this
morning I don't know
but if you enjoy this kind of a video
definitely hit that subscribe button hit
the little notification bell so you know
when I upload new videos and let's guide
and get into it clearly in quite a mood
it's been a long day at work but I'm
really in the mood to film and chat with
you guys so I am just excited um so the
first product I have opened here I was
playing with it is this elf natural glow
lotion I saw this and I thought that's
just gonna be like a cheap version of
the Mac strobe cream boy was I wrong
this is better than the Mac Mac strobe
cream this is something it's kind of got
a pink tint to it but it ends up kind of
blending out what I noticed it does for
my face is it brightens my face it
moisturizes it really is more lotion
like than the strobe cream the strobe
cream is totally a lotion but I feel
like this one's just a little bit more
moisturizing but it adds this gorgeous
glow I've been putting it on over a
moisturizer sometimes I'll use that as
my moisturizer sometimes I'll mix it
with my foundation depending on the
foundation if it's already a thinner
consistency I don't mix it I'll put it
under but it does such a great job if
you're kind of tired of that like matte
look to your face but you have a lot of
matte foundations that are high coverage
that you love this is perfect to put
underneath because it gives that life to
your skin from underneath your
foundation and I just think it is so
gorgeous I feel like it stays on my face
longer than the strobe cream does it's
not quite as shimmery but it still has a
nice Sheen to it which makes it look
normal for you know real life like most
of us live in the real world and you
want to look glam or pretty but you
don't want to look I don't know like for
me I wanted to still look somewhat
natural so I love this stuff I was
totally surprised this by the way is in
the shade
brightening rose I didn't mention that
earlier so I will link all the products
I mentioned down below the next product
that took me by surprise
was a lip balm and this this was sent to
me on accident by supported by the way I
did end up contacting them in the end
and they responded and said that I can
just keep this stuff because they can't
really resell it which was very nice of
them and I but I do feel better having
checked with them but they actually sent
me this this is the cope re
limp love and I when I first opened it I
was like ok squeezy two lip balm that's
been done before whatever and it's like
this clear lip balm I'm like no I don't
want it to look glossy I feel like it's
gonna be all thick and goopy
I've tried ones like this before and I
hated them it didn't moisturize my lips
it just made them look glossy which I'm
like if I want them I can just put on a
gloss this stuff completely transformed
my lips just completely it smells like
coconut but it smells like buttery real
coconut not like sweet fake coconut even
though that it could still be artificial
but it smells very realistic it is the
most lip changing thing it's so
moisturizing I just feel like every time
I put it on in the morning and my lips
are nice all day long no matter what I
end up putting on later I need to get
more of these I have the tinted ones and
those are nice but I like just the
regular one better just because I don't
have to look at a mirror I can just
throw it on and be good for the day um
oh my gosh I love this stuff I highly
highly highly recommend it I want to put
it on now but I have a gloss on but I
love it so much anyone else get this
like when you're I don't know I had a
kind of stressful day I'm just really
glad it's the weekend when I'm filming
this and I get like the little red
splotches well so I have dry erase
marker oh my gosh I'm such a teacher
what a nerd okay next thing that
surprised me was this uLTA Beauty
melissa michelle collapse i love Melissa
michele here on youtube i can link her
channel below she's absolutely freaking
gorgeous it makes me jealous
but she's so like kind and wonderful
that I like get over it you know what I
mean some people are so pretty that I'm
jealous and I don't really like the
personality so it's like a double whammy
I don't wanna punch you but like I'm
jealous of her but she's so sweet that
I'm like but I love her does anyone know
what I mean I know that sound
but I'm just being real you guys and I
know I'm not alone anyway the only
reason I thought I wouldn't like this is
because hey I really hadn't at this time
when I bought it tried a lot of uLTA
Beauty things so I really wasn't sure
what to expect quality ways the other
thing is I feel like beauty vlogger
collabs can sometimes be a total miss
sometimes they're absolutely amazing I
mean there are some amazing clouds out
there but sometimes they're not and so I
was like I don't know but I wanted to
support her I wanted to try it out I
thought the packaging was so good it's
like watercolor just something different
you know and so I opened it and I was
like okay it comes with a lip product to
be honest I really haven't tried it I
can swatch it and show it to you guys
but it comes with nine shadows a
highlighter and a blush and you could
totally use the highlighter as a
highlight duh you could use it as
eyeshadow if you wanted to what am I
saying
hold on I need another water break these
I don't think this is like a perfect
palette I will say that but I think that
it was just so much better than I
thought and I've reached for this a lot
the past month so there's like this
shimmery gold called today Sita and
Katie's and the shimmers are gorgeous
these are very powdery but they're
incorrect at that are you serious
but they are kind of powdery so you have
to be careful you've got to have a
really good primer underneath them I
think that the mattes actually blend
pretty well together and that's another
thing that really surprised me but
they're so isn't that amazing like I was
really impressed with the quality but I
think you do have to work with the
shadows a little bit like when you're
doing shimmer with the with any other
shadow I feel like the shimmer I had
like little bits of glitter down here
and I was like you guys know how I feel
about glitter on my face I don't know
what it is about me but like I just
don't like it I know some people do I
just don't and they're and it's weird
because I really don't see like true
glitter in any of these and yet I still
have like glitter there and there so
that was just kind of odd but they're
still really beautiful it didn't end up
really messy with my look that much
afterthe I don't know the blush is in
Mahal and it is the prettiest color it
might be the prettiest blush color I own
it's gorgeous I think it looks a little
bit better on a deeper skin tone than
mine I actually put it on today of
course it's like I don't know 6 p.m. and
I put it on it like 5:30 a.m. so it's
probably not actually it were kind of
well I didn't really apply a different
highlighter I'll show you in a second
but I didn't reply the blush actually it
looks pretty good I think it would look
even better on a deeper skin tone and
she does have a deeper skin tone than me
the highlights pretty good there's three
shades you kind of mixed together I
think it's a little bit deep for me and
I do think it accentuated my like
textured skin you know like I have a
little scar there and you can really see
it but a lot of highlighters do that
anyway so it's not a huge fault let me
go ahead and swatch the where is it
let me just for I'm wearing a white
shirt what was I thinking let's just
swatch this lip product so you guys can
see it I think it's just kind of a dry
thin consistency and that's not really
my cup of tea but some people love this
consistency it's a gorgeous color I
could totally see her wearing that so I
think all in all all of the colors are
super wearable it's just a really kind
of cool palette and I love the packaging
as well and I really like her so I was
really blown away next thing that took
me by surprise this is volition helix
am/pm IJ this brand their story is so
interesting because if I'm remembering
it corrects like their whole thing is
like if you pitch an idea to them
there's a chance it could get developed
and so any product that they sell
there's usually a little card inside
saying who was the creator who thought
of this whose brainchild was it of you
guys know what I meant um so anyway so
I've tried a few products of theirs and
I've liked some not liked others but
this it sold at Sephora it's like a
clear gel and I was like um I don't
think that's gonna be moisturizing like
I have this weird stigma against clear
gels I'm like that's not gonna be
hydrating enough for my dry skin but boy
was I wrong this stuff is crazy I don't
use it in the p.m. I only use it in the
morning but what I do is I get a little
bit on my fingers it kind of has this
whipped feeling to it but you put it on
and not only does it feel so
moisturizing but I swear to you it like
fills in your pores it is the coolest
I'd gel I've like ever I hate that I
even wasted that it is amazing I've
never tried anything like this
and so each morning when I'm putting
this on the past few weeks I'm just like
yes like I just it's one of my favorite
parts of getting ready now whereas
before I'd be like I need to put on eye
cream real quick and I just slapped
something on because I didn't enjoy
using it I enjoy using this totally took
me by surprise it's gonna last me
forever okay next thing that surprised
me is this Ulta I've got two Ulta beauty
products this Ulta gel eyeliner first of
all again I hadn't heard a lot of great
things about the Ulta brand makeup I
feel like I just haven't heard anything
about it you know what I mean like some
people have done some videos I'm
planning to film and Ulta total brand
review because I've tried tons of
products for the past like month and a
half and so I've got some amazing
products and some bad products to share
with you this when I first like swatch I
thought I'm not gonna like that it's
really really like slippery and I am
like a gel liner snob I used it for
years it's like my favorite kind of
liner I like triple layer of anyway so I
thought way too slippery I don't like it
it reminded me of another one I tried I
can't remember I want to say it was like
the wet and wild when they used to salt
it was like really just slippery would
slip everywhere it was made a really
thin line it wasn't black enough I was
wrong I put this on and I'm wearing
today I've worn it every day since I've
opened it I totally my L'Oreal when I
loved which I can link below as well in
case you have a coupon because that
one's amazing as well I like this one
better
that one got put back into my eyeliner
drawer and this move to my everyday
makeup drawer
it is so black so creamy and yet you
could totally control where you want to
put it I do think you have to be careful
because it is creamy so you could like
go and then it'd be halfway up your eye
so I guess when I said you can control
it I really mean you can't but it stays
on all day it's so black and I just I
think it's easy to play apply my voice
is tired it's easy to apply and
so my bonus product I wanted to mention
is this profusion strobe and glow
palette I thought these are like 10
bucks I think they're sold at Target
right now they're kind of freshly out
right before the holidays and so I
thought like this is gonna be this cheap
dumb highlight palette it's gonna be all
chalky and powdery and weird I'm wearing
this shade today and obsessed on my
cheap bows I think it's so pretty like
all of these are gorgeous they have so
many different shades so if you like to
play put on makeup on other people or
maybe you're an actual makeup artist I
don't know
so the swatches are absolutely gorgeous
there's only two I would like to warn
you about that if you did buy it you
might not want to throw it all over your
face this one in glazed has a lot of
glitter in it like I mean true true
glitter so that's gonna be everywhere
and then this one in fairy dust has this
really cool like purple kind of
iridescent shift to it but it's just not
quite as pigmented as all the other ones
and you can even see that in the
close-up so I just was so surprised by
the quality of most of the shadows and
well you know what I accidentally said
shadows one of them is a little bit
powdery but the rest really weren't
crazy powdery for the price point and
the brush is actually decent like it's
soft and you can totally like apply it
there if you wanted and a little bit you
know whatever and the packaging was
really really nice like it's a plastic
but it's like a thick plastic it clasps
shut shut the these letters like kind of
come out it's just a really nice I can't
believe this is all I think to at that
ten dollar price point so I'll link this
below it was kind of a bonus item but I
just had to mention it I haven't been
using this as long as i've been using
the others and that's why i didn't want
to include it us like the main five but
it really is worth checking out
especially if you have a smaller
collection you want a bunch of
highlighting options maybe you just like
playing with different colors i mean
some of these I could never wear as a
highlight but I could wear them as a
chef so this could be like the ultimate
shimmer palette you know so hopefully
you enjoyed this kind of video if you
did definitely subscribe check out my
other videos which I can link some of my
popular ones down below if you just want
