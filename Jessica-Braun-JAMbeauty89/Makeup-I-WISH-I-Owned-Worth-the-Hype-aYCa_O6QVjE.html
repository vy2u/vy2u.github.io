wanted to share with you guys well kind
of a different video this is going to be
my wishlist of luxury makeup items that
I wish I could own and who knows maybe
one day I will but these would be items
that if and when I ever purchased them
they would be very splurge II very like
you know I've had to think about it for
a long time before I just went and spent
all this money now some of them that
being said they're really expensive
brands but then themselves the product
is not like crazy expensive but some of
them are so let's go ahead and get into
it if you hear noises my beagle is
rolling around he's chewing on a bone
and just rolling around he's like in
heaven he's so weird so cute so I keep a
list on my phone of makeup that I'm just
dying to try and so some of them a lot
of them are drugstore products and since
that's usually what I'm buying but I
also have some expensive products thrown
in there and those are the ones I wanted
to share with you guys today so every
time I am placing an online order I
usually buy my high-end I'm looking at
my laptop now you just be buying my
high-end products from Nordstrom just
because they have free shipping
I've ordered from the many times and
it's oh I've never had any items missing
or broken they've hired some well so
that's just what I do but there are a
million online vendors like I think
Beauty lish sells high-end like luxury
brands as well
but so that's what all linked to but I
always use Ebates right before and I've
actually done videos with Ebates I'm not
this video is not done with up they
don't even know I'm talking about them
but I really do use Ebates every time
before I don't shop because you'll get
like 4 percent cashback or eight percent
cashback so if you're gonna place an
order anyway you get money back so one
of the first things I had on my list is
a Tom Ford eyes shadow quad and the one
that I have my eye on is one called
golden mink it has four different shades
they're all so beautiful I love how she
Maria I've heard that the Tom Ford
glittery and shimmery eyeshadows are
unlike anything you've ever tried
and so I'm dying to get my hands on one
and you know every time I've ever seen
anyone used them the looks always looks
so perfectly blended they just look
expensive you know what I mean and I I
just I would love to try out I just got
the goose I was thinking about I would
love to try one honestly I would try any
of them but golden mink is the one that
I've been looking at for a long time
another product I would love to own is
the Chanel lipstick in boy and it's such
a classic like a true cult classic
everyone that has a Chanel lipstick own
Chanel boy and it's the line that it's a
part of is the Chanel Rouge Coco shine
hydrating sheer lip shine so it's not it
sounds like it's not going to be a
really like pigmented just straight-up
color it's gonna be more of a sheer
shiny one but I'm just so curious to try
it since everyone loves it another
Chanel product I'm dying to try is this
Chanel so late and this Chanel bronzer
and honestly I just want to try it
because everyone that ever talks about
it never seems to be able to find the
words to describe it because it seems
like it's kind of a cream but maybe it
not totally and you know you can put it
on under your makeup to make yourself
just look more bronzed and I don't I'm
just so curious about it and again
that's one of those that you hear about
all the time that I'm like I just want
to try it like I just want to own it I
want to try and see what all the hype is
about and if it would like stay on all
day you know I have to matte lipsticks
so these are I mean these are so
expensive but these aren't like as
expensive as like Tom Ford ones like not
even close but there are two max
lipsticks that I'm dying to try and one
of them is in the shade blankety and it
seems like it's just this really nice
pink color but it's kind of more of a
reserved paint I'm so curious and it's
an amplified one and I never tried any
of the amplified matte lipsticks and I
know a lot of people that's their
favorite version of matte lipsticks are
the amplified formula so I'm really
curious about that and then another one
I'm going to try is Ruby woo and that's
one of the matte ones from Mac and they
Mac reformulated their matte lipsticks
because they used to be a lot more dry
and I have one of the old matte ones of
a different shade and it was it was very
drying
but they've redone them and I do have
one matte lipstick in pleased me and
it's their new matte formula and it
really is nice it's one of two MAC
lipsticks I actually still own I got rid
of a bunch but Ruby woo is like that
beautiful red it reminds me of my Marc
Jacobs one that I have that's called Oh
Miley and it's this perfect red I wear
it all the time in videos all the time
but it's just this perfect matte red
that's like deep but not too deep but
it's not like orange it's just fried in
between it's perfect but Ruby will every
time every time I've seen someone
wearing a red lipstick and I'm like oh I
wonder what that is it is always Ruby
woo from Mac so I'm dying to own it and
try it cuz I love red lips on that lip
theme I have two Tom Ford lip colors
that I would like to try and these are
insane these are like fifty two dollars
each it's insane
so one of them they're both kind of
similar colors it seems but one of them
is called Spanish paint and it just
looks like this really perfect nude
paint color it is kind of a satin finish
from what I've seen it's not like a
matte one but it's just that perfect
like comfortable everyday pink and it
just looks so pretty I've seen a couple
of youtubers wearing it and I'm like and
the other one is one of the matte Tom
Ford lip colors and it's in the shade
first time very similar color from what
I've seen in swatches to Spanish pink
but it's matte so again just to have for
everyday I would love it and the last
one I'm gonna mention is a Charlotte
Tilbury lip liner in pillow talk and
I've heard that these lasts so long the
packaging is so cute and on top of that
this color is like the perfect nude
where it's not too Brown or it's not too
like deep because some nudes can look
really deep and it's also not too light
again it's right in between and I love
that because there's so many nude
lipsticks i have that i don't really
have quite the right lip liner for it to
make it work
but this one seems like it would kind of
be that one that i've needed all along
so i really want to try it and this in
the shade pillow-talk i don't know if i
said that some other ones i'm going to
throw on here at the end are ones that
are on my kind of sephora wish list I
figured I'd throw in because there some
of them are almost just as expensive
that I've been wanting to try one of
them is the cover FX custom cover drops
everyone talks about these where it
sounds like you can just use those alone
or you can use that pigment to mix with
like a more
Dreiser to make like your own almost
like BB cream or tinted moisturizer
really is what it would be and I'm just
so curious to try it but it seems a lot
of people can't find exactly the right
color so they end up buying two and
mixing them I'm like no like that I feel
like that defeats the purpose and
they're really expensive so I'm like
I've got to make sure if I ever do it
that I go and make sure I get the exact
right color so I don't have to mess
around with mixing them to other
products that are kind of on my wish
list the tartlet it's by Tarte
it's the tartlet matte eyeshadow palette
it just looks beautiful tart and Too
Faced are two of my favorite eyeshadow
brands because they're just they're just
perfect eye shadows they're always
pigmented like no matter what I can
always trust that in any palette every
shadow is perfect and they just blend so
beautifully so I'm still curious to try
that one and I can't believe I haven't
bought it yet but I just have it and
it's probably good that I have it but
that might be bought at some point soon
cuz I'm dying to try it and then also
tarte has these new TARDIS lip paints
and I think if I remember correctly
they're Matt right and I haven't seen a
lot of people use these I think they are
but they just were so beautiful and they
have a lot of I really want to try the
shade namaste which is like a very like
a classic nude color I just want to try
it I don't know I love Tarte so much
I think Tarte and to base are just up
there like neck and neck for my favorite
like Sephora brand I don't know but also
in lover I don't know I can't decide you
guys I can't decide so hopefully this
video was helpful for you guys I know it
was kind of different I've never done
one like these but I just I was looking
through all of my like wish lists and
things I added in my cart like in
dreamland they're just sitting in my
cart on Nordstrom and on Sephora and I'm
never gonna bite the bullet but I might
at some point for some of them but
sometimes is kind of helpful when you're
thinking about maybe you have a gift
card for Sephora or for a department
store and you're wanting to you know
really research what you're gonna buy
beforehand or maybe you just have no
idea what to buy but you know you want
to buy something really really nice like
a nice makeup product those are
something that I know a lot of other
people love that I've been dying to try
because of that so hopefully it was
helpful in some way or maybe it was just
enjoyable cuz you just love makeup but
you like here and someone talked about
it I don't know I hope that his
chewing was not too annoying it's
driving me nuts
I can leave my most recent Sephora haul
I know I had a recent like really really
big Sephora haul down below if you're
wanting to actually see me haul some
products and other than that I hope
you'll subscribe to catch more and I'll
see you guys in my next one
