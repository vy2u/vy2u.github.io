gonna share with you what makeup I would
own if YouTube never existed if I
weren't a youtuber or if I wasn't
someone that watched YouTube videos
these are makeup products that I would
probably own if YouTube didn't exist I'm
gonna show you what I mean I'm sure to
some of you you're like what I got this
idea from a subscriber and I thought
that is genius so I don't know if other
youtubers have done this and if they did
they might have done different styles so
what I did is I kind of I marinated that
a little bit in my head for a few days
and I thought let me go through my
collection and I put in this bag this is
just a makeup bag from Jujubee this is
actually like a usually they make like
diaper bags and I bought it on HauteLook
for like 50% off it's really cute I was
planning on using it for my hospital bag
which I probably still well but I put
everything in here what I did is I went
through my collection and I found
products that I bought so none of these
were sent to me so that was one piece of
the criteria they had to have been ones
I purchased myself but not only that
they had to be products that I'd never
heard anyone talk about him YouTube now
the reality is some of these now that I
own them I'm hearing more about so they
might now be mentioned but at the time
that I purchased them I bought them just
at the store or maybe online I saw it
and thought that looks interesting and I
added it to my cart I thought that this
criteria would work for this because I
thought what would my life be like when
shopping for makeup if I didn't have
YouTube and I didn't have you guys
recommending things and other youtubers
i watch recommending things and it was
really eye-opening I didn't have as many
products as I would have guessed and
what that tells me is that kind of
inspires me to be a little bit more my
own person and I don't mean that I'm not
gonna watch reviews and because I want
to know like the reason you guys are
probably watching me and the reason I
watch other youtubers too is because I
want to know like well I don't want to
spend my money in something that sucks I
want to know you know is it any good
what are the pros what are the cons you
know but I want to be better about
getting out there you know a little bit
ahead of the curve and trying things
that maybe no one's talked about maybe
trying brands no one's talking about so
that was my own kind of realize a
I even got my husband in here I'm like
look this pile is all that I have that I
feel like I bought completely on a whim
on my own without any other kind of
influence just kind of interesting
concept so if you're a youtuber or
blogger I totally challenge you guys to
do this or even if you're just a viewer
and you love makeup to go through your
collection and really just look at like
what is it that I myself bought because
I just wanted to buy it nothing to do
with any other influencers so let's go
through this I don't have everything for
like a full face I genuinely just pulled
out what I bought that fit that criteria
so first thing I'm actually wearing on
my lips and this is newer to me this is
from I guess the brand is lana lips i
was placing an order on Nordstrom's
website for some things that I had heard
about on youtube and I this was
recommended and I'm like I've never
heard of that and his color looked so
pretty and I declared a lot of lip balms
and I was like I just want something new
something I've never tried this is their
tinted lip balm in perfect nude and I
literally that's what I have on today
I'm obviously applying more and I just
put it on with my fingers now I know
that girls does some people out but it
is a squeezy tube this is a thicker lip
gloss it's definitely thicker and it
first I was like I really like it like
my lips feel like they like it like I
feel like it's almost nourishing them in
a way it says hydrating and nourishing
create soft hydrated and pretty lips no
artificial fragrances paraben parabens
mineral oil sulfates anything and it's
against animal testing so this is made
in Australia and I freaking love it I've
never heard anyone talk about this so
that was a find of my own I guess but I
really like it
okay so future Jessie here I have
discovered after wearing this a lot more
that it does leave one of those lines
around the inner part of your lip so
after you know an hour or two of wearing
it you just have to be aware of that and
either reapply it or take it all off so
that's kind of a downside to it but I
don't mind reapplying it because I do
enjoy the way it feels on my lips next
thing I bought and I hadn't heard
anything about it is this soap &amp;amp; Glory
speed plump all-day super moisture
marvel I bought it at want to say Ulta
maybe Target I think Ulta
and it's a moisturizer and it's really
nice it's really really nice it's just
kind of a white moisturizer that just
kind of blends in it has this kind of
moisturizing gel like feel to it I love
putting this on in the morning before
makeup because it sinks into your skin
really quickly and yet it's relatively
inexpensive so this is something I've
already used half of it up I really like
it I probably would repurchase if I ran
out because it's such a great simple
moisturizer another product I bought
without hearing anything now you hear
about this all the time but this is the
Physicians Formula healthy foundation
this is one that I was placing an order
on physicians formulas website and I saw
this notes like hey I want to try it so
this is kind of a stretch because it's
like you know now it's mentioned all the
time but it was something I bought
without hearing about it and I love the
giant doe foot applicator I really like
this for everyday it's very reminiscent
of like a nice BB cream where it's kind
of light to medium coverage you can
build it up a little bit but it makes
your skin look like skin it covers some
imperfection but it can still breathe
and so I found that I really like it I
wear the shade lc1 eye I'm a big fan
another product I've not heard anyone
talk about is from pixie so I picked
this up recently at Target just cuz I
was like ooh it's there vitamin makeup
mist it's got orange blossom citrus
extracts it says it's energizing facial
water it sounded it reminded me of like
charged water which I really like from
Mac um mixed with my favorite actually
over here pharmacy skin do kind of toner
kind of like a mixture of the two and it
says you know it really is a toner miss
so I've used this when I'm not using my
pharmacy one I'll spray this on clean
skin I'll spray it on as a setting spray
as well so you can use a lot of
different ways I'm still getting used to
it but this was just one that I just saw
and purchased without hearing anything
about and I'm enjoying it another way
that I thought okay if I if YouTube
didn't exist for me how else would I
know what makeup to buy and I thought
while friends would recommend some stuff
so this is one my friend Laura
recommended to me and it's the B or a UV
aqua rich watery essence this is an SPF
cream it's freaking amazing can buy it
on Amazon if you live in the States and
it has SPF 50 the reason this is so
amazing is
I mean it's a high SPF but tons of
things out that it's that it's such a
nice moisturizing texture but it doesn't
make your skin greasy and that's what's
crazy about it like it just sinks right
in it protects it but it's not greasy
like at all it's the coolest thing it's
like the thinnest layer of SPF but it's
really effective I used it when we were
in Vegas because I was with my friend
Lauren Vegas and she let me use hers and
I was like oh my gosh and it was great
because we were in the Sun like at a
pool party for quite a while
and my face did not get burned so
absolutely incredible and again that's
one way that I've thought well that
would be one way that I would find out
what makeup to buy I'd be through
friends like face to face another
product I would have learned about while
I did learn about in when I was in shows
like when I did theater and I'm not to
say I'm never ever gonna do it again but
I have it in quite a while I remember
learning about Mac and someone I was in
a show with had a Mac blush oh it was in
the shade pink swoon this is beautiful
like rosy pink blush time a blue tone
pink well this is the shade Melba but
again this was something that I I would
have bought on my own and actually I
think I did buy one way before I knew
about YouTube because I saw someone else
using in the show so that'd be another
way that I would have found out about
like what makeup to buy it's crazy
because it's hard to think back to
before you knew about YouTube you know
what I mean
and I know some people right now are
still discovering YouTube and
discovering this whole beauty community
but like for someone that's been
watching it for years like you and I
probably have it's hard to think back to
what like how did I shop for makeup like
what makeup did I own like it's so hard
for me to remember I wish I could like
hop back to the day just for a little
bit and just see what it was like I know
that's so weird but anyway also these
Maybelline singles these shades are soft
pearl and cool cocoa these I used to buy
all the time so I figured I'd pull these
in now these they probably reformulated
since then but I used to buy maybelline
singles all the time and you know I just
have one or two shades and that's just
what I would use but these are actually
really really nice
I have other shades too but now the
other shades I have are more popular on
YouTube I have the glow
and another but these are just I mean
they're really nice and these are like
perfect for everyday looks I could do a
look with just these two and call it a
day that's probably what I would have
done years ago and so those are ones
that I definitely would have had in my
makeup bag regardless but like the more
popular ones on YouTube the shade wise
are the glow down is like a really
pretty kind of golden toned one it's so
pretty I know some people use that for a
highlight and then my personal fave
which is nude glow and this is more
bronze II but it's got that beautiful
shimmer as well I mean those are like
freaking stunning expensive quality
shadows so I don't know that I would've
owned those maybe you know I don't know
but definitely the other ones those are
totally colors I would have bought in a
line that I definitely bought another
thing Revlon this quad I randomly picked
up on a whim in moonlit I love this
honestly
it almost looks like this is what's on
my eyes it's not I'm wearing the viola
Voss holy grail palette but this totally
would create the look you see on my eyes
I mean the white kind of on the brow
bone and on the lid this also on the lid
crease and outer corner it's pretty
close pretty close anyway I used to own
some of these quads now I don't know if
it was exactly these Colorstay quads but
these they're not these are not as good
as the Maybelline singles I'm gonna tell
you that I think this is okay and with a
brush it blends fine it looks fine but
they're not as good as the Maybelline
singles so if you're like thinking about
one or the other I'd go with me believe
what I think is interesting but also
makes perfect sense is that most of
these products are drugstore and you
know what I'm going out and spending I'm
kind of gambling on trying some new
products it makes sense that I would be
much more keen to try something I've
never heard about that's cheaper because
I'm not investing as much of my money
whereas if I'm gonna buy something on
Sephora I'm probably gonna do some
research online or watch a video or
watch a review unless it's something I
know you guys are asking me about or
it's a new product I'm just really
interested in trying for my channel but
as a regular consumer you know I'm not
just gonna go to Sephora and drop two
hundred dollars on five new products
just on
whim if I weren't a youtuber does that
make sense okay another product I bought
just on my own is the ultimate e
full-coverage liquid concealer freaking
love this stuff I really really love
this stuff
it's one of my favorite conceals all
time I will definitely repurchase it
it's like seven or eight bucks I don't
think it says full coverage I don't
think it's full coverage I think they
need to take it out of the name but it's
a really nice like whipped formula I
think it's just so nice it's got good
coverage enough for what I need and for
what I think most people need if you
have severe dark circles you might need
something more because again I don't
think this is truly full coverage but I
think it looks so beautiful and natural
on the under eye while still covering
and that's why I love it another one is
the Catrice prime and fine brightening
eyeshadow base now I'm gonna be honest I
don't remember if this was sent to me or
I bought it but it's like five bucks I
want to say I bought it but I can't like
really with authority say that I did cuz
I just don't remember because I know
Catrice does send me some stuff but this
stuff is amazing I could see myself
having bought this you know what I mean
if there was no such thing as YouTube
it's this white eyeshadow primer it says
that it brightens eyeshadows I do think
it does I really really like this primer
a lot it's a lot thinner so if you need
something really like thick and tacky
this isn't gonna be your cup of tea
but if you have pretty normal or dry
skin I think you really really like this
and the last thing I bought just on a
whim on my own list from pick seats
they're glowy gossamer duo and delicate
do it's a highlighter it's freaking
amazing they're two shades more golden
one and a more ivory one it is like
ridiculously it's ridiculously pretty
much it looks gorgeous on and I could
totally see myself seeing this in the
store and being like ooh which is
exactly what happened to me when I
bought this not long ago but so those
were all of the products that had
YouTube not been a thing for me or if I
didn't even know about YouTube right now
these are ones that I could see myself
buying at the store or really I just did
buy on the store without having any
influence on myself whatsoever I hope
this video was fun I know it's kind of
weird I feel like I over explained it
but if you want to do the style video
please do please let me know down below
because I would love to watch some of
these like what would we buy ah anyway
it's just kind of it's like a black hole
when you start thinking about it you
can't stop anywho if you enjoyed I hope
you'll subscribe as well and give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it too
as well too much anyway I'll see you
guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
