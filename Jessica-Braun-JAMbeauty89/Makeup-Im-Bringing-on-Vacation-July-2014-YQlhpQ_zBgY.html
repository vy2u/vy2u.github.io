makeup bag video for you guys so I'm
debating still between which makeup bag
I'm gonna use this is my Sonia Kashuk
like I think it's called a completely
organized bag and this is like the
medium sized they have smaller ones they
have bigger ones and they've got
patterns and colors but I just got the
black because I don't know I guess
that's boring but I thought the black
look awesome like with the gold I just
thought it looked cool but I also love
my little Victoria's Secret kind of wipe
away back but it's not as hard to see
everything in there when you're kind of
getting ready and you don't want to dump
everything out so I haven't really
decided which bag I'm going to use but
that's kind of what I'm deciding between
and I have sitting here a bunch of
makeup that I'm gonna be bringing with
me and I'm really excited to share with
you guys cuz this is kind of a good way
to know products that I'm loving that I
would be willing to travel with and I
know that I trust them that they'll wear
long throughout the day and the wear
well things like that so very excited
let's start with the face so one of the
face items I'm bringing is this
foundation this is the Revlon Colorstay
whipped and I wear the shade 150 buff
and it's just a really kind of thicker
obviously whipped consistency of a
foundation but what I love about it is
that it photographs well because it
doesn't have SPF in it and the face
moisturizer I use during the day has SPF
so I don't need it in my foundation and
it'll photograph better than you know
some SPF type foundations so I thought
that would be great since I knew we
would be taking pictures and things like
that and this is a tried-and-true one of
my favorite favorite foundations another
face product that I'm bringing I'm
bringing two face powders but they both
serve different purposes
so this is the face powder I go for when
I'm just wearing the moisturizer and no
foundation which like today I'm not
wearing any foundation and it's the Mac
mineralize skinfinish natural and I have
it in the shade medium which is really a
little dark for my skin any other time
of year but in this summer it works but
what I like about it is it provides a
little bit of coverage but it still lets
your skin kind of breathe so it never
looks really too heavy or cakey it
really does look natural but it does
cover a little bit more
just a moisturizer with some tint and it
does so I really really like that but
then the other power I'm bringing is my
Rimmel stay matte and this is the one
that's in the transparent shade and this
is just great for oiliness I mean that's
all I use it for I don't powder my
entire face with it and I only use it
when I need to like typically just in my
t-zone
but again another tried-and-true product
that I know that I love let's see one of
their like face products do I have I'm
not bringing a primer I really don't
wear a primer like at all I haven't worn
it in a long time I've just been using
my moisturizer from Paula's Choice that
I love and I haven't want a primer a
long time and really I've broken out
less I'm like I think primers just break
me out you know anyway so I am gonna
bring a setting spray though and this is
the Mary Kay makeup finishing spray and
it's made by skin Naevia I love it it's
just like my all-nighter but it's in a
much smaller container so I think that
is perfect to bring along with me can
see otherwise I'm just bringing one and
this I love this one and when I was
going to reckon sealer Joanne I was like
it's obvious this is of course the one
that I'm going to bring it's the
maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and I love the one that's in the shade
brightener it's kind of a pink toned
concealer it really cancels out any
darkness here but it also really
brightens and it never at least on me it
never looks cakey it blends so easily
into the skin and beautifully and it
doesn't really budge all day so that was
an easy choice for me and then I'm also
bringing the bare minerals concealer
which is the powder and it's in the
shade well rested which is more of a
yellow tone so if I wake up one morning
and it's really really dark I might also
I'll use the concealer and then maybe
top it a little bit with this as well
just to really cancel out that coloring
because again if you're out and you're
taking pictures and places you don't
want to look all cray-cray alright what
else
okay so bronzer I'm just bringing my
Tarte pact Park Avenue princess bronzer
and this is just a trial size that I
have and I'll probably never go through
it but it's just a really nice toned
bronzer it's not too dark but it's not
too light and can warm up your skin or
it can really darken it up if you apply
more so I like that it's kind of
buildable and it never looks too crazy
on me odds are I won't end up wearing
bronzer at all but I like to at least
and it's pretty small it doesn't take up
much room to at least have the option
the only blush that I'm bringing is the
Maybelline master highlight by faith
studio and it's in the shade pink rose
and what I love about it is that when
you apply it all of these colors swirl
together and there's a little bit of
shimmer so when you apply it you never
need a highlighter it kind of adds like
a glow to your face without needing a
highlighter and so I thought duh that's
perfect for travel so I don't even have
to pack a highlighter which is awesome
and I don't really highlight my face
very often either so again that works
that well where to next let's talk about
eyes shall we so I'm bringing kind of
for my eye primer it's the only one I'm
bringing it's a cream shadow by benefit
in RSVP and it's just a little deluxe
eyes and it's just this rosy colored
really shimmery pretty cream shadow and
what I love is it doesn't move I'm
actually wearing it today although it's
kind of washed out but I just love it
and I usually don't go for pinky tones
on my eyes but this one just mmm I love
it and honestly when I run out of this I
will be repurchasing it I love it I love
the consistency of it what I usually put
on top of that is this Maybelline Color
tattoo what do they call it it's their
pure pigment and it's in the shade
barely braised and I've talked about
this a few times and I have a tutorial
coming up on my channel soon where I use
these products together and it's just so
beautiful so I was like duh bring in
that and then other than just those two
for my eyes I'm just gonna bring this
palette and this is the Too Faced
natural eyes palette and it just got 9
beautifully neutral shades a lot of
shimmer but also plenty of math and I
was amazed by kind of the versatility of
this palette I actually got a sweet deal
on this on QVC it was like on sale for
$30 and I don't really know how much it
is originally I don't think it's too
much more than that and then there was
like a 20% off or something like that so
I ended up getting it for $24 and free
shipping and it came at the full-size
shadow insurance I was like ding so for
24 bucks a phase and the full-size
shadow insurance and I don't think that
sales still going on but I figure I
mentioned it because QVC will randomly
have like stupid amazing deals on makeup
so anyway so sweet deal on this and it's
beautiful so I think I am
this it comes with a mirror in it which
is nice too so four liner I'm bringing
three liners
well three black liners and then another
one but you'll see why the way they
typically do my makeup is all use a
pencil liner first just a tight line
like fill and kind of between the lashes
and the waterline and stuff and this is
just the Urban Decay black velvet eye
pencil that I got in an Ipsy or
something and I'm just kind of using up
but I love it and then I usually will go
over that and make a thicker line with a
gel liner and this is the starlooks one
that was part of the Ashley hackman
collection that I adore so that was a
no-brainer and then I typically will go
like if I'm doing like a wing I'll you
help I'll use a liquid liner to kind of
help with that sometimes and this is
just the Jordana fabula nur I have had
this exact one for like so long like so
long and it's still working like look
how black this line is it just
constantly amazes me because this is
literally like a year and a half old and
it's still alive and kick'n and it was
like $3 love it you can get Jordana I
know it I've seen it at Kmart if you
have came right near you and then also
like Walgreens sells it near the
checkout okay so those are all the black
line your scent bringing but then I'm
just bringing for my lower lash line
that star looks exit to Eden pencil you
guys know I love this I think I
mentioned a lot of these products were
in my everyday makeup drawer because
while their products I'm loving so but I
love this greenish shade for the under
under line under eye on under the eye
eyeliner whoo that's a struggle it's
kind of early for me I'm not used to
filming this early but I got a lot to do
in pack before we leave I'm very excited
but um so I'm like new but I wanted to
do this because I know I like this kind
of video so I wanted to fill mystery
guys
oh I forgot to mention eyebrows a very
important part I'm bringing my Anastasia
brow Wiz boo pencil and it's got the
spoolie on it so that's an extra tool
that's already built in and it's just
what I use every single day and I'm
bringing a miniature Anasazi a clear
brow gel that Canadian subscriber sent
me thank you
a while ago and I finally open it
because I finally used out my full size
I'm like well hey this is perfect for
travel also it's my favorite so bringing
that and I know that with that brow gel
my brows won't move throughout the day
so
no matter what we're doing they'll just
still be looking looking fresh and fly
all right what else so for mascara this
is the l'oreal voluminous and just the
original not the carbon black not any
not waterproof just the original and
it's in blackest black and I you know I
have a few mascaras that I haven't open
yet and this was my next one that I
wanted to try and buy try I mean I used
to love this and I haven't used it in
like probably over a year
I forgot how amazing this is like
literally upon first opening it it was
perfect it doesn't clump it volumizes
like crazy from 6:00 in the morning when
I applied it to probably honestly like
midnight when I took it off it was still
like curled and separated and tons of
volume and black I was like this is
unbelievable so and I what blows my mind
is most mascaras they need like a week
to kind of like almost dry out a little
bit but this one straight from opening
it was perfect so I'm very excited to
bring this and this is a tried and true
one for me so and then let's see for
lips I'm bringing only well a couple
options I'm first of all bringing my us
sweet mint lip balm which is just my
favorite eye I mean I gotta bring it
it's my favorite and then I'm bringing
only one lip gloss this is the buxom lip
gloss just a little small one and it's
in the shade Sofia I just love the way
these feel I don't need a mirror to put
it on and it just feels good and the
color is kind of really neutral doesn't
really look like much which is just fine
for me I just love it and then I'm
bringing kind of a nude everyday look
and then also like a bright crazy look
in case you know like we're going out to
dinner in a nice place or something so
I'm bringing the lip liner the NYX nude
pink lip liner which pairs really well
with the Mac angel lipstick that I'm
brain which is really just a really nice
neutral light pink color it doesn't look
weird and muted but it doesn't look
crazy and colorful it's just perfect for
everyday and I like those two together
and then for the kind of more amped up
look I'm bringing Mac's
lip pencil in the shade beet as in like
the food beet and that goes really well
with my favorite bright lip color and
it's the covergirl I guess it's the lip
perfection or whatever they're called
and it's in the shade eternal and it's
just this beautiful radish but it's got
a really nice blue tone to it so it
doesn't make your teeth look yellow it
doesn't run it stays put I just love the
formula of these and up oddly this is
the only covergirl lipstick that I have
I don't know how I haven't bought more
because I do love for Mia but this shade
is just the perfect red for me because I
don't like the orange II Reds on my
skintone so so that is everything I'm
bringing oh we'll see if I decide what
bag or maybe I'll end up deciding on a
different one or maybe I'll split them
up in some other way but since we're
driving I don't have to worry about
separating it into you know like a
carry-on bag some of the liquids into a
carry-on versus we're just driving and
it's just gonna be so fun I'm very
excited give me this video a thumbs up
if you enjoyed this type and maybe I'll
do it each time I travel maybe because
it certainly is different every time I
travel there anyway
I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
