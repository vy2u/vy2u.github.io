want to share with you an anti hall I
haven't done one of these in a while
isn't this a weird shirt
I forgot I own it's a maternity shirt
which is good because who I need the
real but it like ties on the sleeves so
I do like going its head office I'm like
Tyler will you tie my sleeves any ways
but it's comfy I forgot I owned it glad
I know even remember that I owned it
anyway these before you even ask the
earrings are from tarjay and here I got
them on clearance and then on my lips
I'm wearing Laurie Elle's coloration
matte lip liner in 108 and then the
bareMinerals lipstick in alpha it's the
only bright pink lipstick I own
currently so it's really really
moisturizing it's one that you know
you'd have to reapply throughout the day
but I really like it I think it's fun
alright so my anti haul so the idea of
an anti haul is not to bash brands it is
not to okay at least in my in my sphere
with the reason I'm doing entails it's
for fun I'm just trying to share with
you products that I'm not interested in
trying these are not products I have
tried before I'll try to explain my
reasoning sometimes it's onna buys them
because I just don't want to buy it it's
my it's my opinion and I know we all
have our own opinions and that's cool
that's great so if I mentioned not
wanting a product and you love it or a
brand doesn't mean I hate that brand or
that you know or I'm just having fun
with this I literally just pulled up
Sephora and then I clicked the new tab
and we are scrolling down together and
I'm just finding things that I have no
interest in buying so my favorite reason
for doing anti hauls and the reason I
also watch anti hauls is because I think
it's a good practice to really be
critical about what's being thrown out
there for us product wise why they think
we want it and to really be cognizant of
why are you buying it why are we buying
these products why are brands still
coming out with these because people are
buying them so really to think deeply
about yourself as a consumer and you
know are you just falling for all this
hype because
it's a new collection well the thing
about new collections is and I already
know what I'm gonna be starting with is
when they're like a limited edition
collection well if you are buying it so
you can share that if you like oh yeah I
love this palette well after a little
while they're not people buy it anyway
and so I'll look I'll watch youtubers
make up collections and they have all
these limited-edition palace and they're
like well but I can't really use this in
a tutorial anymore because it's like it
was limited edition I can't use this and
I'm like and that is why like if you're
a youtuber like me or a blogger or
whatever when it comes to makeup
I really don't buy like any limited
edition like it's very rare I will might
get sent stuff but it is very rare for
me to actually go out and buy limited
edition stuff i buy a lot of things with
my own money both drugs for an high end
every month I'm buying things but it's
very rarely limited-edition for that
reason so the first one I'm definitely
not gonna buy is the tarte be a mermaid
and make waves i shadow palette this is
$42 it the clamshell how adorable it is
adorable it is the colors they're pretty
a lot of neutrals but they've got some
fun pops of color I am sure it is
gorgeous
I've seen some swatches and they look
really pretty but again it's one of
those limited edition collections that
is centered around mermaids or unicorns
or fairies and I know that a lot of you
guys out there love that that's awesome
I love really like I have a weird
obsession with things that have to do
with ancient Egypt but if every makeup
company started coming out with ancient
Egypt palettes like tons of them I'd be
like okay this is a little too much even
for me who likes ancient Egypt you know
what I'm saying so I mean any of these
kinds of collections I'm just done with
I'm done with the mermaids I'm done with
the festivals I'm done with the fairies
and all that I don't know that I ever
cared about them to begin with to be
honest but here we are and a million
collections later this is gonna be a
weird one for me to mention but
something I know I'm not going to bite
is the Brio geo scalp revival charcoal
peppermint oil cooling jelly conditioner
I freaking love Brie ojio hair products
like it's probably one of my top
three favorite hair brands but I already
love their scalp revival micro
exfoliating shampoo because I feel like
it's a really deep shampoo I only use it
like once a week even my husband I think
uses it I say I think because now I'm
like how I asked him if he uses it it's
fair game if it's in the shower but I
wonder if he's trying to and I love that
stuff but for me I don't want a I don't
lemme rephrase
I don't need a scalp treatment I just
don't I don't have a problem with
dandruff at this point in my life and so
because of that I don't feel like I also
need the scalp conditioner and for
thirty-six dollars I'd much rather focus
that on like for me I need more moisture
in my hair that's more my problems so
the Brio geo deep masque a deep
conditioning mask they have that I'd
rather spend the $36 on instead of on
this conditioner so it's not really
bashing that product per se it's just
something that I know that even if I saw
ten other youtubers talk about and
that's another thing we all do you watch
a bunch of youtubers talk about a
product oh I'm a that sounds amazing I
need that so you buy it and then you
realize oh wait but I don't have scalp
problems or dandruff problems and I know
like for myself for the longest time I
would watch people talk about you know
like this amazing highlighter in the
back oh my gosh I need it so I'd go buy
it and then I would get the highlighter
and realize this does not work for my
skin tone at all and we've got to be
more aware of that because we get so
hyped up I mean I am a youtuber I get it
but you know just being aware of like
okay all of those five youtubers that
love that are a little bit deeper than I
am
do I really think this highlighter is
gonna work for me or do I really need a
scout dandruff conditioner or not just
because they all love it doesn't mean I
even need it
okay alright I'm laughing because this
is insane this is the Natasha de Nonna
tropic eyeshadow palette this is 129
dollars now without being said I have
spent that much on a palette I did buy
the star palette very late to the game
ask me how often I use this not very
often now that I've curated my
collection a little bit more I wanna I
want to use it more often these are so
these shadows are gorgeous they are and
I am sure that these bright colors are
probably abso-freaking-lutely stunning
but for a hundred and twenty nine
dollars you had better freaking love
love bright colors and wear them every
single day
because these are neutral in my opinion
and I still don't wear them every day
and I'm like that I've got to get my
money's worth
I do like and like I said they're good
shadows but to spend over a hundred
dollars on something that you're gonna
wear from time to time is crazy no
matter how many youtubers tell you they
love it it is beautiful I've seen a
swatch it is gorgeous but it doesn't
mean you yourself need it so just keep
that in mind and with that in mind I see
right above it Natasha de Nona has her
mini sunset eyeshadow palette so even
though those aren't quite the same
colors if you're just dying to try
Natasha - Nona shadows that's $25 it's a
lot more feasible you could find colors
that hopefully you actually like like
the sunset one looks like more of a warm
tone without having to spend a hundred
and twenty five I will spend money on
some things like skincare I might well I
might groan and all this about spending
a lot of money on skincare but at the
end of the day I'll do it because I know
how important good skincare is but for
bright eyeshadows I don't know I don't
know I know I'm gonna say something and
it's about a brand that I've mentioned
before that I really like the brand I do
I think they're a classy brand I've
talked about why I think they're classy
brand in the past I'm not gonna go into
all of that but one thing I could not
spend my own money on is tatcha they
have this luminous dewy skin mask it is
$12 now in all fairness they sent me
this mask and I was like ooh this is
really quite mean what a cool idea like
a luminous mess well I haven't tried it
yet so it may be amazing but to spend
$12 on a mask that you are going to
throw away after one use I can't swallow
that I just can't and so even if I tried
it and thought oh my gosh is amazing I
might share that with you guys but I
would have to share the cavea caveat
that $12 for something you're going to
throw away after one use is insane to me
that's just crazy
right I mean am i and it might have
amazing skincare ingredients but I would
rather instead of buying like let's say
three of those masks for $36 I'd rather
buy a nicer serum for like 30 or 40
dollars where I can use that serum for
like a month or two months and not just
one time so that's where I just like
like takes your breath away and when I
saw that they sent it to me I was all
excited and then I look to the prices
also oh whoa so I'm literally saving
that for like a very special occasion
like maybe when I go have this baby
maybe I'll bring it and so like the next
morning I'll put it on and be like I
deserve this
I deserve this $12 ridiculously price
mask all right now that being said I've
tried other Tata products and I really
really like them I'm using actually a
lot of their skincare right now their
rice powder I'm using as my cleanser and
my skin is looking nice I'm using their
camellia cleansing oil right now again
also not gonna be buying the Sephora
collection holographic face and cheek
palette $28 same reason as I said before
I'm over the holographic thing I frankly
I don't know that I ever really liked it
because it's not my makeup taste I get
that it's some people's and frankly I
look at people on Instagram I'm like oh
my gosh they look amazing and they have
these you know holographic eyeshadow and
highlight and whatever but it's not me
and I know that about myself so I've
never really cared about it I've never
spent my own money on it and I don't
know that I've ever really recommended
much from any sort of holographic line I
don't know that I've ever come into
anything but now Sephora has one and
it's new and I'm like ooh a little late
there but it looks like it's got like a
blue I'm gonna click on this one because
it looks like it's got some blush tones
but then okay so that it's got matte
blushes in it and then you've got these
holographic pearl things on top and it's
green blue and pink so typically that's
the kind of thing that once you put it
on it you know takes on this kind of
holographic or iridescent maybe kind of
a look and you can put it on top of the
blush you could wear it as highlight
whatever Kevyn Aucoin had a similar
thing and I was like well it's like it
was like their prismatic palette they
sent it to me and I got rid of it pretty
quickly because I swatch it and I was
like what like I'm never gonna wear that
on my face but I know so many of you
guys do and it looks to me
so props to you but this is something I
am going to pass on knowing that it's
not my style this one's gonna be a
little controversial but one thing I'm
not gonna be buying is the NARS
narcissus wanted cheek palette I have
never bought NARS cheek palette I have
wanted them I have looked at them a lot
let's watch them and they're always
really nice I really like NARS blushes
but I never reach for blush palettes
the only blush palette I feel like I
ever reach for and frankly it's the only
one I kept after my declutter is this
hourglass ambient lighting edit volume 3
because it's not just a blush powder it
has everything else I've traveled with
this a lot again I think this was like a
limited edition but they sent it to me
and I use it all the time well a true
blush palette I never reach for because
there's you know six shades that some of
them work for me some of them won't and
so then I feel like I'm getting not
enough use out of it and to me again
knowing myself I know that I won't get
enough use out of it so it's just not
worth the $59 price tag no matter how
amazing the blushes are so if you know
yourself and you've got a drawer full of
face palettes and you don't use them
don't buy another frickin face palette
stop yourself cuz you know you're not
gonna use it you might use it a ton the
first three weeks you own it and then
that'll be it and you know that that's
true and it's gonna sit in your drawer
the Benefit Cosmetics gold rush blush
I'm not gonna be buying that one it has
it overspray over it and instantly I'm
like why why why are companies still
putting overspray down stuff I get that
it looks pretty but then you get through
it and it's just totally a different
product like that just seems so cheap to
me it does and even really expensive
brands will do that and I'm like why
like why are we not past this yet now if
I ever did try it like oh I'm dying like
maybe a ton of you guys are like please
review it I'm dying to know what it's
like I would probably buy the mini size
for $15 but it just it looks it kind of
looks like rocket or honestly just a
peachy shade with a little bit of
glimmer there are a thousand of those
out there you don't need to spell
and what is the yeah $29 you don't need
to spend $30 to find a blush that
performs the way it was do now I do like
benefit blushes my freaking honestly
might be my favorite blush of all time
is the Dallas blush it's amazing it
looks like a bronzer it looks super
boring but I do love it so I get that
appeal and I get the appeal of the
benefit box blushes like for the longest
time I had all of them and I love you
look at them and smell them but at the
end of the day I really wasn't using
them because it's the same blush as you
can get at the drugstore so for that
reason I'm out anyone else watched Shark
Tank my husband and I are obsessed with
that show and I think I was watching
eleventhgorgeous the other day and one
of them said and for that reason I'm out
and I was like shark tank like instantly
so those are all of the products that
for right now I'm gonna pass on I don't
have a desire to try for one reason or
another I hope I explain myself well and
like I said this video is just for fun
um sorry it's just for fun it's not
meant to you know bash on brands or
anything it's just sharing my thoughts
on you know all these kinds of things
that are out there right now and the
different trends that are out there I
would love to know maybe one or two
products that you have no interest in
trying like another one that just popped
in my head that new what's that
chocolate it's a Too Faced chocolate
palette but it's like got the gold all
over it I have no interest in that one
either
right like those kinds of things that
you look at and you're like I don't get
it like I don't care how many people say
they love it I don't care to try it I'm
already over it just from seeing it once
so let me know what those are down below
because I'm always interested in knowing
your guys has thoughts too so if you
enjoyed this kind of video give it a
thumbs up so I know and I hope you'll
subscribe and hit that little
notification bell so you get notified
when I upload new videos and other than
that I'll see you guys in my next one
