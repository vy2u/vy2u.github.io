my next everyday makeup to our video a
lot of you guys are so sweet you know I
always forget about these videos I love
them I just time gets away from me and
like mostly favorites are easy because
it's at the end of the month and I'm
like oh at the end of the month I need
to film that but everyday makeup drawers
I always do kind of randomly in the
month so there's no like date that makes
me think oh I need to film that but you
guys are always tweeting me snapping me
and saying hey time for your next
everyday makeup to her so I appreciate
that
so last month in April I filmed my
makeup collection so I kind of treated
that as my everyday makeup drawer
because you got to see in my two drawers
for that so my other most recent of
course was in March so I will link both
of those below if you're interested in
them but other than that let's go ahead
and get into the makeup I'm trying out
and using this month so in this left
short here I've really cleared out a lot
and stuff I had before I've got a lot of
new products and some that I pulled out
for my collection that I just need to
try so right here I have my ELF
cleansing cloth I use these for swatches
I really don't use them on my face but I
like to help once they get the job done
in they're cheap so I have my seal
assailed a liquid liner that I love I
have a Maybelline brow precise brow
liner that I've actually never tried so
well that's not true I've tried it this
week but it's still new to me so I'm
liking it so far very similar to the
Anastasia brow Wiz and I have my Tarte
fake awake that I'm trying I have
actually today in my lower waterline I
like it actually a lot I think you can
get drugstore versions like pixie Selda
version that's exactly the same thing
for just a little bit cheaper then I
have my pixie I defined waterline it's a
really creamy black liner I mean it's
really really black I love that and you
can obviously use it in the waterline I
love it then I have my ELF makeup
remover pen my NYX control freak eyebrow
gel I just bought a new one of recently
it's just a clear gel that you can brush
through your brows to hold them in place
it's not as strong as the anasazi one
but it's perfect for everyday then I
have the pixie lower lashline mascara
I've been using a lot lately it's a
really cool just
a little tiny wand it's perfect for
grabbing the lower lashes then I have my
favorite superhero mascara from a
cosmetics and then the dupe for the
drugstore dupe the essence lash percent
princess I love both of these so much
this one's just way cheaper and then
this one's almost done it's the Clarins
Supra Volume Mascara and I like it I got
it for free on oculi so I don't think I
would buy it with my own money but it's
okay then back here is some oh this is
an eye product it looks like a lip
product it's the elf new like creamy
liquid eye shadows and this one's like a
rose one what was it called blushing
rose and it's just a really pretty color
it looks like a lip color doesn't it it
kind of sheers out the more you blend it
which I don't love but I have not tried
it on my eyes yet that is why it's in
this short and then before I talk about
the lip product I also have this elf
like liquid highlighter it kind of keeps
separating but it's really really pretty
really similar to a lot of the ones that
are out there right now but this one is
like oil-based and it's I don't know
it's just kind of got a different look
to it and I really really like it then
the lip products that I have back here
my favorite drugstore lip products the
infallible paints this ones and spicy
blush I love these from L'Oreal they're
like a whipped comfortable formula kind
of glossy but not super glossy I love
all of those I really like the
Neutrogena moisture Stix
these are obviously not like a gloss but
they do kind of have a glossy finish to
them this is the moisture smooth color
stick in pink nude I love that for
everyday and then another favorite these
are all clutch smaller colors because
it's what I actually wear every day the
Revlon Ultra HD in HD sand just a really
simple peachy nude these are all three
really really comfortable everyday looks
which is why they are in here so then I
have my elf mineral fused mineral
infused face primer I love this stuff it
makes your skin feel like a baby's
bottom it fills in any of your texture
and lines and pores beautifully I
actually used it today I'm loving that
stuff
then I'm trying this out this is the
covergirl outlast all day let me use it
once and it seemed pretty good but I
want to use it some more and the
applicator on this by the way I don't
love it's like a sponge kind of but it's
like a hard sponge I don't know I just
don't like that as much on this and then
this is one it's the L'Oreal infallible
total cover this is a very very full
coverage foundation but I haven't tried
it in a while so I wanted to give it
some more 11 but it's very full coverage
this one I haven't even tried at all and
I've had it for a while it's the pixie
h2o skin tint I think it's what to be
like a tinted moisturizer apply as you
would a moisturizer oh so maybe it's
more but it's like tinted yeah so oh
yeah it is more of a moisturizer it's
not meant to like cover I don't think
because you can see it kind of starting
to get weird
I don't know so I'll have to try it on
let you guys know I'm curious about that
one and then I have my ELF daily brush
cleanser that I recently got just to
spray my brushes after each daily use
and then obviously it's not deep
cleaning them but at least keeping them
a little bit cleaner than if I didn't so
that's what's the matter let's move on
to the other one okay so on this side I
have let's start over here some of the
sponges I'm using currently these are
the Eco tools ones I haven't even tried
the smaller one yet
but I really like this and my L'Oreal
one I really like this - I'm so
impressed with what's coming out for
cheaper now so I love all three of those
well those two and then I've got my
tweezers my little lash comb lash curler
from tweezerman these are meant for I
think I don't remember they have ones
meant for different eye shapes and I
really like this one my tweezer is my
little scissors things like that then I
have my tatcha camellia gold spun lip
balm this is like the most luxurious lip
balm I've ever used in my entire life
it's so amazing it definitely has a
strong smell but I've gotten used to it
I kind of now like it but it is very
interesting I love this stuff and I have
my Anasazi added brow I use every day
including today by L'Oreal
my L'Oreal lacquer liner I love it's in
blackest black I use that every day
without fail then my I actually use this
today my Milani keep it sweet lip scrub
this stuff is amazing because it's just
this scrub that's kind of suspended in
this almost lip balm like texture it
smells like vanilla cupcakes and it
scrubs your lips so amazingly and yet
they're still moisturize it's so amazing
and it's like you know under ten dollars
then I've got my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre I used to prime my eyes right now
my flower Beauty blush it's their flower
pots powder blush and sweet pea this one
is so beautiful it's new to me so I'm
still trying it out which is why pin
here but it's just the most beautiful
everyday pink color I think it's perfect
for spring I was really impressed with
quality of that then another new product
right below what I haven't even tried
yet is this essence Sun Club matte
bronzing powder it's for lighter skin I
think they had one more that was a
little bit deeper but definitely has an
orange tone very bronze II but not too
much so I'm very curious to try it with
my skin tone see if it either looks
really nice or really bad but that was
so so Chi then I have my Milani strobe
light highlighter in day glow and this
is the more golden toned one I also have
the more pinky toned one but I've been
wanting to try this one a little bit
more it's so so beautiful so buttery wow
these are really good from the drugstore
then I have another highlight it's a
matte radiance highlight matte radiance
big power and highlight oh one is from
Laura Mercier this is one of my favorite
favorite highlighters because it is
exactly that it's almost matte but it
definitely is radiant it's so perfect
for everyday I've been wearing this
every day for weeks and then sometimes
I'll put like a more boisterous
highlighter maybe in strategic spots but
I'll put that like not all over but a
little bit more heavily the Laura
Mercier one I love it
so I also have a new product from Milani
their prep set and glow illuminating
transparent powder this reminds me of
the hourglass dim light powder because
it just has the quality to it that it's
definitely just a powder but it does
have the
I don't know like bit of Radiance
- it's not shimmery or glittery at all
so you can put it all over your face but
it just looks so nice and it makes
everything blend so seamlessly together
not is why I really like it then I have
amount of my favorite products I bought
from the drugstore in a long long time
it's their bronze booster Physicians
Formula bronze booster highlight and
contour palette and matte sculpting so
it has these three shades here they are
so so so good it's got a true bronzer a
kind of grey contour and then like a
matte highlight I just filmed a separate
video on this that white one kicks up
some powder though but I used all three
of them all the time and it's so amazing
it stays on all day I cannot recommend
this highly enough I have a shimmer
version as well I have not tried back
here I have my two Physicians Formula
correctors their mineral wear cushion
corrector and primer duo's and yellow
and green and peach and lavender I just
haven't tried these yet I need to say I
don't know that's not true I tried the
green one and I didn't feel like it made
a huge difference then I have this dupe
for the Z Ramona color switch it's one
from swiffers I found on an end cap at
Walmart so if you're looking for
something like that of course you can
also use like little hair donuts that
are made of this I mean you can do this
so inexpensively but if you want one in
a tin for a little bit cheaper than the
V Romano one this would be a great one
from Walmart and then I just have this
little container with like a little
mirror eyedrops contact sharpen are just
kind of little doodads back there and I
think that is everything in my everyday
makeup chores so hopefully you enjoyed
that video and like I said I will link
