of pita chips and hummus failures like
all in my piece anyway today is my
everyday makeup dwarf for June and thank
you to you guys who tweeted me and
reminded me hey time to do it everyday
makeup for June I really appreciate it
because I tend to forget these but I
love doing these videos so today I'm
going to share with you guys what is in
that drawer and that drawer right behind
me these are products that either are
brand new to me so I'm wanting to try
out or they're just favorites that I use
everyday this is kind of where I keep
all the stuff I'm using or the month
except really I'm always pulling out of
my drawers as well because I just like
playing with makeup but it's kind of a
collection of products that I want to be
able to have really close at hand for
this month if you enjoyed this style of
video I hope that you will subscribe
while you are here any lots of drugstore
in high-end videos all of the time other
than that let's go and get into it ok so
this is my left drawer here on this side
I have my Milani eyeshadow primer I just
feel like it was getting lost in my
collection and I love it so much so I
wanted to make sure that I'm using that
this month I have my NYX dose of do face
gloss which I've been talking about a
lot recently beautiful just glossy look
to it and I just love this and it's
really inexpensive and then my glossy a
little cloud paint blush I have it in
the shade dusk I want to get one that's
maybe a little more pink that one's
really peach it's pretty but I want to
try another one I have not even tried
this this is a number 7 airbrush away
primer I'm dying to try my healthy
elixir covergirl foundation I'm wearing
7/10 and it's a perfect shade match for
me so really liking this a review is
coming if it's not up already if it is I
were into below this is something new to
me from covergirl it's their advanced
radiance pressed powder and it's got
really pretty packaging and it comes of
course like a little puff but it's just
kind of a powder but the idea is that it
has a little bit more radiance than
normal
I've only used it like once or twice I
feel like it still looks pretty powdery
but regardless I'm still trying it out
because I don't know I feel like I'm
wanting covergirl to have some really
great products come out like I was
really impressed with that so I'm going
to keep trying it
this powder however I'm trying to figure
this one out it's from a cosmetics
thereby by ports illumination it's a new
product it's in radiant translucent so
it comes with a little sponge and so
it's like a translucent powder
supposedly except for it's insanely
radiant so I'm not sure like M is used
as a highlighter but it says it's like
to get rid of pores I don't know so I
guess it's a highlighter I tried it all
over my face and laughed because it
looks crazy so I just need to use as a
highlighter maybe it's just more like
subtle one so I'll have to let you guys
know ok these are rolling all over the
place
so I have two highlighters my pure
afterglow that my friend Laura got me
hooked on it's like the prettiest
highlighter ever oh my gosh I love it so
much then I got the J cat you glow girl
in Crystal sand I recently got this and
I wanted to make sure wow that I was
using it that one is crazy I love it so
those who are in there so I also have my
bare minerals just regular foundation
honestly I just forgot I even own this
and it's not that old so I want to make
sure I'm using it I think it might be a
little bit yellow for me but I always
like when I'm wearing this how my skin
looks so I wanted to use this more this
is my new little baby I got from
Influenster recently know from ostomy
actually it's a Dior nude air Luminizer
and it's in the shade 3 this highlight
is unlike any highlight I've ever owned
because it does have this shimmer that's
like different than anything else so I'm
what I filmed a video today about it and
if it's up again I'll link it below
basically and is it worth it video but
I'm definitely using that this month and
I've got my glossy a soothing face mist
rose water sway spray this stuff is
beautiful smelling it smells like roses
and it just feels really good on the
face so I've been using that like in the
afternoons just like to spritz it on my
face then the elf daily hydration
moisturizer I've been using I really
like this stuff it sinks into the skin
really really quickly which is nice so
you can actually put it on under makeup
and you don't have to wait a long time
for it to kind of sink in I also have my
number 7 loose setting powder just
because again I felt like it was getting
lost in my collection I wanted to
surely using it some really good
drugstore powder I have a little
headband back there
I have my laura mercier secret
brightening powder which I love my Bobbi
Brown corrector that I love for dark
circles on your under eye it blends in
so beautifully my Anasazi brow is my
L'Oreal lacquer liner in black is black
this is another one I just found in my
collection and I'm like oh yeah from
Juice Beauty it is gorgeously emollient
cream blush and it blends so well into
the skin so I definitely want to give
that a try if you've seen my Dollar Tree
get ready with me I use this blush it's
actually really good it's from LA Colors
it is glittery there's no getting around
that but it's a really pretty color it's
in peach rose and then this is the brush
that came with that your highlighter so
that is that drawer okay so my right
drawer is filled with a lot of stuff a
lot of this is repeated from last time
this is my cosmetic superhero mascara I
love elf makeup remover pen I brought
this one back in my Milani stay-put
black liner it's amazing it's waterproof
this is the Milani brow gel it's just
clear really really good as well a new
favorite is this NYX epic ink liner it
is so it's the best drugstore liquid
liner I've ever found I've got my pixie
eye bright liner that I like in my lower
waterline the pixie lower lash mascara
glossy a boy brow the more I'm trying
the more on loving so if you haven't
seen my glossy video about it showing
how it works
I will link it below and then the
Maybelline brow precise little micro
pencil I've gotten here as well then I
bought this recently and I felt like I
hadn't been using it so YSL Touche claw
blur primer so I wanted to pull that out
to make sure that I'm using it it's a
beautiful primer it really is now do I
think it's worth the high high price
that I don't know I'll have to go back
with you I don't know that it is but I
do like it the glossy a perfecting skin
since in light i love for when i'm in a
rush mic otally vino perfect serum it's
so beautiful and radiant I always use it
during the day in the morning this is
this Christian Dior one I got from oculi
as well it's in 772 this is the most
comfortable matte
ever ever ever worn it just glides on
but it feels moisturizing and it
actually stays in place and you can like
rub your lips together and it just looks
better like it really is crazy but it's
their classic matte formula then my Shea
Moisture lip balm it's the water mint
and ginger one this hourglass one is in
the shade influencer I just like these
but I keep forgetting about them and
this shade is so pretty so I wanted to
put that in this for the month my
Clinique pep start eye cream I'm just
trying to use up it's good but I don't
think I'll repurchase it I've got my ELF
daily brush cleanser back there my ship
cheap dupe for the color switch I have
both but I've just been using this one
from Swiss purrs you can find it on an
end cap in Walmart just keep your eyes
peeled just to switch the colors off of
your brush without using like spray
palettes I got back here this is the
Milani palette in earthy elements and
it's just got beautiful shades doesn't
it let me swatch some of this for you I
thought these colors together were so so
pretty oh my gosh isn't that ridiculous
for drugstore I love it then I also have
my NYX perfect filter which I love I've
talked about in some videos this
recently came in the mail it's the it
sea and love for lacquer or Jess it's
their collapse so it's a bunch of
highlighters and a beautiful blush and I
was so impressed with the quality of
these and I'm loving I have the it C one
from Michelle from Ready Set glamour who
I missed so much here on YouTube and the
shadows were really really pigmented and
it had a gold case I like this color
case even more and then the blush oh my
gosh isn't that ridiculous oh my gosh I
could stare at it all day so super
excited about that can't wait to use now
I've got some wet and wild little wipes
I got from the Dollar Tree what else
what else what else Oh over here I've
got a couple sponges this one I use
today it's my um flower Beauty one
that's amazing just it heavenly skin
thing which clearly I need to clean
actually really makes applying blush
really seamless and really beautiful
I've got a mirror tweeze them in curlers
sharpeners little beauty blenders I need
to clean all these little hair ties just
little odds and ends that you might need
but you kind of want to ring
together and that is everything in this
