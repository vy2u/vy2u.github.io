a video hi I'm excited to do that
sounded insincere but I really am
it's like when I always tell my students
like guys this is my favorite thing in
math like this is my favorite thing to
learn in math like you say it about
everything I'm like I know but I have a
lot of favorites I genuinely do but
today I'm gonna talk about products that
I have changed my mind about so these
are either products that changed my mind
for the better like I didn't like them
at first and now I love them or maybe I
thought I liked them at first and now I
realize you know what I really don't
like them they're not a very good
product for me so if you enjoyed this
kind of video definitely give it a
thumbs up subscribe if you would and hit
that notification bow so you don't miss
any of my new videos let's go and get
into it so one of the products I've
changed my mind
about is this high end pallet it's the
lorac pro 3 I really really liked this
when I first got it and honestly it was
pretty recent that I bought it pretty
recently and so I feel like when I
bought it I'm like these shades are so
up my alley they're warm shades there's
some shimmer there some matte you know
all the things you say that are good
about a palette and i genuinely believe
to that and i think i might have even
done like a tutorial no I did I'll link
it below I very rarely do like tutorial
I don't even like to call tutorials cuz
I feel like it's more just like a demo
but I'm not an expert anyway so I really
did think I liked it and I did however I
feel like for me I could only get like
one look out of it period now I'm not
one to branch out and do crazy looks
anyway and there's not a lot of crazy
colors in this that's part of the reason
why I liked it so I don't really fault
the palette for that but the reason I
changed my mind and I've kind of
realized you know what I'm kind of
thinking about decluttering it we'll see
is because I feel like all of these
shimmers are really really pretty these
are insanely buttery but I just feel
like no matter how I wear these they
just end up looking the same
like just generally even like this rose
bronze over here like I don't know it's
pretty but I feel like they all kind of
blend
together because they're so soft and
it's a very thin shadow that I felt like
it would just blend together and then
every single I look I ever did with it
always look the same now is this a bad
quality palette no I do think that this
shade medallion is like one of the worst
shadows ever it just like crumbles when
you touch it but not in a crazy
pigmented way it's more of a like it's
just not a good shadow it gets
everywhere right away no matter how you
apply it
there's a lot of chunky glitter but the
rest of the palette is really really
good I just think that after trying it
for I don't know over a year now has it
been that long I think so um I just kind
of decided it's kind of a met palette I
don't think it's bad if it were the only
palette I had would I use it up
absolutely but because my job is to try
and review products I'm kind of like I
think I've decided it's just not the
best palette out there for me very
quickly realized that I didn't have like
anything to wipe swatches off with um by
the way these are the craziest things I
keep I feel like I'm doing a lot of by
the ways today but this is from skinned
Iceland it's their Glacial cleansing
cloths now I don't use laughs when like
the white balance gets a Jo and I look
super tan and then it goes back to
normal
Jessica anyway these things are the
crazy I think they're kind of pricey
they sent me these a long long time ago
and I think I tried like a sample pack
from like an Ipsy a long time ago and I
was like these are pretty good
they're like sudsy like you take it out
and they literally like do you guys see
them you probably can't it's like
literally like sudsy they're so wet in
the best way moist just cuz I know a lot
of people don't like that word it makes
me mad anyway I mean like literally you
can almost see like soap on my skin it's
the weirdest thing now have I ever used
these just rate applies I was gonna say
no but actually I have because everyone
smile put on a foundation I'm like abort
mission abort mission
it looks terrible so I'll usually use
these swipe it off I've never noticed my
skin react nominal negatively
however I've used it on my face maybe
three times and they've it's always been
sporadic so I don't know but I do know
that they're amazing at wiping off
swatches and they like make your hands
feel freakin like
so I'll link these below as well because
they they really are kind of blowing my
mind they're like one of the very few
makeup cleansing cloths I've ever used
for any purpose that have like stood out
as being above par wait is that a bad
thing in golf on par better than part I
really really good nonsense
back to my look hawk and why I make fun
of myself because I really don't know
how to say it I think it's Lacroix but
I'm sure if you have a beautiful French
accent you say it way better so I just
make fun of myself anyway but back to my
uh Mickey straw that Tyler makes funny
before okay so next product that I
totally changed my mind on is this
two-faced peach glow palette if you
recall when I did this original video
like on the whole collection which I
could also link below because there were
a lot of loves and a lot of duds this
was one that I think and I haven't
rewatched that video in a while but I
remember just feeling really kind of
wishy-washy I felt like the blush was
pretty good the highlighter is pretty
darn good but I remember talking about
the bronzer there they are right there
and feeling like like it's not very
pigmented well I've come to realize that
if you have a skin tone like mine it can
look really nice and soft on your skin
however if you're anywhere like if
you're darker than me it's not gonna
show up so I've changed my mind in that
I've grown to really like this I already
loved the smell like really loved it
like everyone so I'll just come home and
come smell these it's so good um if you
like peaches but I've come to like it a
lot I'm wearing the bronzer today and if
you're fair like me it really does look
nice and with the blush and the bronze
are also being really nice I feel like
now that I've gotten used to it works
again I say that with that kind of
disclaimer that if you're darker than me
you're not gonna like this you'd be able
to use the highlight and the blush but
why buy a trio that you know you can't
use the bronzer shaded you know but if
you are someone to me I think you
actually might like it because I feel
like the bronzer looks kind of
natural because it's not super dark I
don't know I'm kind of surprised at how
much I've been reaching for this and
that's why I wanted to mention it in
this video so another product I've
changed my mind on and I recently did a
video on this is this Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation when I originally
tried this years ago when I first
started my channel I I really didn't
like it because I've got dry skin and it
just really accentuated now coverage
wise yes it covers a lot I mean it's
very very hot coverage that's why it's
super well-known but I just I don't know
I couldn't get on with it and I think
the shade I had then was too light as
well this is what I think is a little
bit a little bit too dark um but like
the next one down see light so I'm like
yeah anyway I had the shade accrue by
the way if you're curious I mean it's
pretty close anywho I recently did a
video where I'm applying it on camera
wearing it throughout the day checking
in so you guys can see it the reason I
check I will link that below the reason
I've changed my mind is because I
changed the way I apply it and I don't
just mean like now I'm applying it with
a sponge which I am and that is
different but I'm applying like a an oil
underneath
so I'm putting like an oil on my face
first like the Smashbox primer oil or
the ridiculously expensive far Sally
elixir like rose gold elixir whatever
any of those kinds of oil Oh a new one
that's more affordable I feel like I
keep talking about it but it's the derma
e radiant glow face oil it's been in my
everyday makeup store because I've been
using it everyday this is a lot more
affordable so I'll link this one below
beautiful you put that on your face
first then to kind of sink or to get the
oil to stay almost as a barrier into
your skin put a moisturizer on then a
hydrating primer then this and it's like
perfect so I'll link the video where I
show you how to do it in the products I
used I think I did that before I even
had that more inexpensive version of the
oil but I really do like this it ended
up not making my skin look dry because
of all those layers underneath did it
take a ton more time not really I mean I
already moisturize before I already
primed before any foundation so the only
added separates out
but I'm kind of realizing especially in
these winter months it makes my skin
look good under and
Foundation anyway so I really did grow
to like it now I do want to try the
estee lauder what is it like the water
fresh or the nude water one that's maybe
a little bit more moisturizing it's not
quite as heavy-duty
very very curious about that so if you I
do have another question if you're
similar in my skin tone you know we
usually wear the same shades what shade
are you and this very very curious okay
another product I've changed my mind
about these are a lot more affordable I
know that like literally everything I
mentioned is more expensive and that was
unintentional but colour-pop shadows
I've never hated colour-pop shadows but
I feel like I've mentioned in years past
I think I ended up declaring all of them
but maybe one and my reasoning was I
never really felt like I used them
enough like I didn't really know how to
apply them but I've kind of realized
that you just kind of have to jump in
and apply them and I am sure to some
people you're like what are you talking
about just go what do you mean you
didn't know how to apply well when they
would have like a matte shadow like this
is one from the little like dog
collection they did with Laura Lee it's
called glitz um which is a funny name
for something that is just like a matte
shadow really pretty one well like what
I would be I would try to apply it with
my fingers in the crease and I'm like oh
I can't figure it out because it's kind
of that cream to powder formula well the
second I just took a regular brush and
applied it like a normal shadow oh my
gosh like it was so beautiful I think I
was just intimidated because of the
texture then I was like well it can't
possibly apply like a normal eye shadow
so I didn't even try I know this is my
these are my own mental blockades I'm
creating anyway so that blew my mind
and then I've gotten really into I'm
wearing this one today I've gotten
really into just you know just swirling
in like the shimmery glittery ones
swirling it in and just tapping it on my
eyelid in the morning over like every I
look this one's in the shade birthday
cake and that's what I'm wearing today I
mean of course it's over other shadows
but it is so freakin pretty these I mean
I think most people know about these but
if you don't if they're new to you these
are like these you could almost push
your finger to the bottom of the pan
like
it's very it's not a powder but it ends
up setting as if it's a powder and
that's why I was kind of describing it
as a cream to powder formula so I'm just
gonna show you a few favorite shades
it's overwhelming
they have so freakin many of these these
are what around like five dollars and
they sell them in sets that go together
I like picking out singular ones however
all of these are from I've gotten them
randomly I want to say the all of these
had to have been sent to me at some
point because I remember placing it on
our color pop a long time ago and I
don't think any of these shades for them
this one's in the shade heinie it's
another one from that dog collection
it's like a gorgeous copper with glitter
and this is like the only way I'll
actually apply glitter on my eyes cuz it
actually stays on your eyes it doesn't
get everywhere it's the craziest thing
very very rarely do I have little bits
of thought but it's nothing compared to
like every other glittery kind of shadow
I've ever used
this one's called fluffy this I think is
just from their regular line and it's
just a really pretty gold oh my gosh
these are so gorgeous and then trying to
close these as I go so they don't dry up
and then another one I love is wait is
that birthday girl thing okay so that
first one was birthday cake this one is
birthday girl and it's more of like a
silvery topi well but it still kind of
got a warm pull to it these are so
pretty these are the ones I've just been
reaching for a ton I feel like they're
so appropriate for like the holidays
just cuz they're just that little bit of
glitz but you really didn't have to work
that hard you just kind of tapped it on
let me go ahead and swatch for you this
one in glitz that's that matte one
because it's such a pretty shade just
like a standard kind of reddish tone
anywho so really really have fallen back
in love with these but I don't know that
I was ever really in love with them to
begin with I don't know I know a lot of
you guys are so awesome you guys will
snap me and be like I just binge watched
like hundreds of your videos I'm like oh
my gosh do you feel like you're going
crazy I would feel like I'm going crazy
but I've done that to some like
youtubers that I just like fall in love
with and I'm like oh
they don't have any new videos I will do
the same thing I will just straight-up
binge and add tons of their videos to
like my watch later playlist and just
freakin go to town for like weeks but
then by the end of it I'm like we are
best friends I now know you and we are
best friends even though they're like no
who are you I have no idea anyway um why
did I bring that up how did that come to
my mind Jessica think oh because if any
of you guys had watched any of my like
way old videos where I talked about
Clara you can probably tell me better
than I remember how I felt about these I
don't remember ever hating them I just
don't feel like like I guess I don't
think I ever got the hype like whoa
people would have entire drawers now
many of these people got like all of
these sent to them but like would have
entire drawers in there I use these all
the time I'm like how you have a hundred
which ones do you use anyway I am just
like reeling over how pretty it is I
could stare at that all day okay so
those were all up let me make sure hold
on did I change my mind
okay those were all of the products that
I've kind of changed my mind on recently
if you enjoyed this kind of video let me
know maybe I can do another one in a few
months I mean these are not easy to do
very often because it's only so often
that you really change your mind but it
was fun to do I challenge you if you are
another youtuber to do this same video
and other than that I hope you'll
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye who was just talking really
