new little baby eagle he's what tired of
seven weeks old yeah do you want to say
hi hi but you're using so cute got
stinky puppy breath don't you open giant
ears stop biting my face hey everyone
its Jessica and today I'm going to share
with you some makeup empties that means
these are makeup products or beauty
products that I've used up and I really
have formed a pretty hard opinion about
whether I love it whether its kind of in
or whether I hate it so let's go ahead
and get into it the first empty I only
have one hair empty I probably had a few
others but it's been months and I'm sure
I threw it away when I moved here so
this is the Herbal Essence naked dry
shampoo I don't like this stuff I feel
like I keep accidentally somehow buying
it again like I don't know what keeps
happening but I feel like it's gone
through like three of these and every
time usually I'm like oh like hate the
way it smells I just don't like it it
doesn't truly get rid of the oil in my
hair so it's not doing its job so I
don't love this stuff now I do have a
recommendation my favorite is the
batiste dry shampoo and they've got a
ten different cents I don't know they've
got a lot I usually get mine at
Marshalls or TJ Maxx they're around five
ninety-nine sometimes it can be a couple
dollars more depending on where you're
getting it but I love those they
actually soak up the oil and they're
just really really good my next empty
and it's kind of empty this one I'm
getting rid of with a heavy heart this
is the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray this is the very very old
packaging I have had this sense I think
before I started my channel a couple
years ago and it was one of the very
first expensive I don't know why I'm
putting that in quotes it is expensive
one of the very first expensive makeup
products that I've ever purchased for
myself and I loved it and there's still
a little bit left but the nozzles not
working right and I've kind of
under hot water it's still not working
and it's just really old I'm like I
don't know I don't really feel
comfortable wearing it and every time I
see it in my setting spray drawer that
organization I have I think to myself I
don't really it's pretty old I don't
want to spray it on my face so I might
repurchase it so because it is really
good but the l'oreal one's really good
as well as is the ben nye final seal and
there's just a lot of good ones out
there so I don't know if I'll repurchase
it but it is good another one I'm
getting rid of just because it's gone
bad but it still has like half the
product in it this is the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation one of my
absolute favorite foundations I
recommended this in my wedding day
makeup look I love this stuff I wear in
the shoot 150 buff although I think
right now I can absolutely get away with
something darker but I've already
repurchased this the downside of this is
the packaging because it's in a jar
packaging air and light and all kinds of
stuff is getting and touching a lot of
the product every single time you open
and on top of that it's not ideal
sanitation wise because you're dipping
your finger into it you could dip your
brush into it or you could get a little
spatula but for me when I'm quickly
getting ready in the morning I don't
have time to get a little spatula I
don't know maybe I'm just lazy but
regardless this it now smells weird it
smells like stinky feet to be honest
this smells really bad so I wouldn't
want to use this anymore but like I said
I've already repurchased it because I
love it it just gives this beautiful
satin finish to your face and I love
this stuff another face product that I'm
just it's gone bad this is the polished
choice resist super light daily wrinkle
defense it's basically a tinted SPF so
it's got an SPF of 30 in it and it has a
little bit of tint to it and it's just
past the expiration date and I don't
want to risk it but you can see it's got
a little tint and what I loved about
this stuff and I have used most of this
up is that it's one of the only
sunscreen products that I've used that
doesn't make my skin look super oily it
really kind of in a way it mattifies it
not completely but maybe it's more of a
satin finish but it's just beautiful it
looks gorgeous on its own
but I wore it under foundation every
time I used it I loved it ended up
providing just a little bit of coverage
essentially I use it as a primer I guess
is what I'm trying to say it is lovely
will I repurchase maybe it's kind of
pricey and I right now I'm trying out
elf has an SPF primer that I want to try
and see how I like so I might if I don't
find one that I love as much as this I
might repurchase it but I'm gonna wait a
little while next empty is a concealer
this is the Maybelline Dream Lumi
concealer it has a brush tip and you
just kind of turn it and it comes up
into the brush and then you you know put
it wherever you want here's what is
amazing about this I've repurchased this
so many times probably four or five
times it just it takes like just the
heat of your finger and you push it into
your skin and it's gone like it not gone
it has melted beautifully into your skin
I guess is what I should say it is
amazingly brightening it just takes two
seconds to apply and it looks flawless
every time it looks flawless so I will
repurchase this in fact this has been
empty for a couple months now and I'm
I'm missing it in my collection so I do
need to repurchase it I love it
the one downside is you run out of it
crazy fast because there's like no
product in here it's crazy it's not fair
okay three different mascara empties the
first one is a L'Oreal voluminous it's
their waterproof now you guys know if
you've watched my channel a while
I love the L'Oreal voluminous mascara
but the waterproof formula is different
of course it is but it's just not the
same it doesn't hold my curl the way the
original one does it volume volume eyes
is enough but it's just not the same and
on its own it's just in my opinion it
doesn't work with my lashes so it's I
mean it's a couple months old I could
probably get a little more use out of it
but I just don't want to so I'm just
gonna get rid of it now I know but I
would recommend the original voluminous
I love that so I just did a video
comparing this like almost $30 mascara
to a 5 dollar one I can link that below
this is the it cosmetics tightline
mascara and I compared it to the NYX
skinny mascara I love both of them but
the NYX skinny mascara is a better deal
and it does the exact same thing and
it's I just liked it better but
the idea is that it's a primer for your
lashes it's a really really thin almost
non-existent wand but when you use it
you wiggle it out your lash line it kind
of provides a dark tight line area for
you and not only that it but it
separates your lashes and then you can
put a regular mascara on top and it
looks lovely I love this stuff but I'm
not gonna repurchase it because now I
know the Nick stuff is even better in my
opinion and it's like five dollars okay
but another mascara that's similar is
this Maybelline lash discovery this was
waterproof it has again a little bit
variable wand it's still really thin I
used it the same way to separate my
lashes however this one you can totally
use on its own and it's beautiful I
would say that it lengthens and it
separates but it does not add volume so
if you're looking for that you might
want to put another mascara on top like
the Jordana best / extreme is one of my
favorites you could put that on top of
it love this stuff and I probably will
repurchase this when I run out of the
NYX cuz I want to go back and forth I
just love both of them alright I've got
a liquid liner empty this is the
Georgiana fabula inner and this stuff
I've had forever it still kind of works
it still does a pretty black line but
it's just really old and like I don't
want to put that all around my eyes it's
like years old but this stuff lasts
forever you can get it at Walgreens for
I want to say around 2 or 3 dollars
that's really really cheap but it's got
a sponge applicator and it doesn't
really Bend it's pretty firm but it's
great if you're a beginner or if you
just know that you've got to get ready
quickly it can do a nice wing for you I
mean it's it really is a fantastic
liquid liner if you haven't tried it you
really should the next empty is one that
I always have I probably have more of
these for this empty video but I just
throw them away I just kept one this is
the elf makeup remover pen they're three
dollars it's exactly what it sounds like
it is and a lot of you guys asked how I
keep these clean and I only you know I
keep them clean for as long as I can but
basically once so if I get mascara up
here and I just kind of dab it off with
this once I fixed the patch work that I
just did I'll just take this and wipe it
off on a tissue or a washcloth whatever
I have near me that way it comes off if
you let it sit in there for a while like
whatever
Scarah you wiped off I swear after even
ten minutes it's not coming off but if
you do it right away pretty much wipes
completely off so it makes them last a
lot longer
I love these another empty is my CEO
Bigelow my favorite night bomb this
stuff is amazing I swear I mention it in
tons of favorites videos you can get
into Bath &amp;amp; Body Works or online at I'm
sure many different stores online but
it's a night bomb but I wear it all the
time
it's beautiful if you put it on in the
morning before you put your makeup on
because then it sinks into your lips and
you just oh so moisturizing I use it at
night as well right before bed I love
this stuff I've already repurchased that
oh so many times but I already have
backups like all over the place another
almost empty is my Maybelline instant
age rewind now this is in the brightener
shade and I I will use it up there's
still a little bit left but it's got a
sponge applicator on the top and you
twist it and it comes up into it and you
can put it wherever you need to put it
this stuff is probably the most
brightening concealer I've ever used
it's amazing I do however want to try I
used to have the one that's an actual
like not a pinkish shade like this it's
more like a yellow I think it's like in
light I don't know I want to get that
one next time though because I want to
see how that coverage is because I
remember loving it but I haven't
repurchased that in a while so but this
is amazing
I'll probably repurchase this in the
near future as well I love it
so brightening another empty I've got is
this L'Oreal lacquer liner and it's
their 24-hour like gel or cream liner
that they have in blackest black I still
have a little bit to use and I will use
it all up this stuff is amazing it'll
stay in your collection for a long time
cuz it takes a very long time to run out
I wore this on my wedding day I would
trust it with anything it does not move
it creates a really thick line a lot of
you guys ask how I get kind of a crisp
line on top it's just this I layer on
some other things but if this is what it
is if I can only have one version of
liner it would be this another good one
though is the Maybelline eye studio one
it's I swear they're like the exact same
product so that might be the one if I
don't repurchase this I might get that
one I kind of switch back and forth
between those two in my very last empty
is my Rimmel stay matte powder I have
had one of these in my collection since
middle school I've used it ever since
then and now I'm 26 years old now so I
don't really feel like doing the math
but it was been a long time over a
decade so it's it's just the perfect
powder for getting rid of oil if you
don't want to add a bunch of coverage or
like a cakey thick powder foundation
this is perfect
I've been using it I have it in
transparent or translucent whatever it
is and it's okay but I like the one
that's in the shade 0:04 sandstorm
because it doesn't really add color to
your face but it's just a really nice
shade that's not as ghosty does that
make sense
so I love this they're around $5 around
there I love it if you haven't tried it
you're missing out definitely pick one
up if you're in need of a setting powder
those are all of my empties if you enjoy
I can link my past empties videos below
or I don't even know I don't think I
have a playlist because I don't have
that many cuz I'm really bad about
keeping trash because I just want to get
rid of it if it's done but I'm trying so
hopefully you enjoyed this they are fun
to do though because it's like miniature
little reviews of a ton of different
products hopefully you enjoyed this
video if you did please subscribe and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
