a video that is a tag video and Fleur de
force here on YouTube I think she
created it and I saw it a few months ago
and I was like this is such a great idea
so I added it to my list of videos I
wanted to try and finally getting around
to filming it today and I was so excited
these are all products that have
withstood the test of time
so she titled this tag the test of time
tag because these are all products
beauty makeup etc that have withstood
that test of time where I still love
them I've either repurchased them or I
still use them after years of doing this
on YouTube or maybe just years of using
that product just in general so if you
do this style of video or if you've done
one please let me know below because I
like watching them I feel like it's kind
of like a Holy Grail but it's one that
you know you're really kind of digging
into the past as well and think about
one of I love for a very very long time
so if you enjoy the style of video
definitely give it a thumbs up and I
hope that you'll subscribe as well and
let's go ahead an get into it if you
like I use this mug every single time I
film but in reality it's just one of my
favorite mugs but anyway you're gonna
have to let me know though if my like
lipstick starts looking crazy because
this is not a matte liquid lipstick and
so it's it's just a classic lipstick
it's one of my favorites should we just
start with it so a lot of these are
drugstore but I'm gonna start with
what's on my lips because it's been a
favorite for a few years now and I love
it so this is the Marc Jacobs Lamarck
lip cream lipsticks and this is in the
shade 200 oh my ly if you see me wearing
a red lipstick it's almost always this
I've always said that and it's almost
always true unless I'm like testing
something out
it's the perfect red it's not too orange
a yellow tone it's not too blue tone
it's like right in the center it's just
that classic statement red you can use
any red lip liner with it I've never
really noticed any issues like matching
different red lip liners with this and I
use all different ones but I feel like
the comfort of this lipstick is
top-notch now these are expensive
there's no getting around that
but the comfort of these the
pigmentation I'll swatch it oh my gosh
they're so creamy and beautiful they
don't really yeah they have no smell
I think is cool because some lipsticks
I'm talking to you L'Oreal some
lipsticks have the strongest smell and
if you don't like that smell or if
you're really sensitive to it Oh like I
can't use any of their lipsticks period
it makes me so sad because some of the
formulas are good but I just can't do it
anyway so creamy I do have a few other
shades but none of them have quite
rivaled Oh Miley for me but this one is
in Sonic truth and it's more of a kind
of nude but kind of pinkish nude very
wearable for everyday and then I also
have infamous which is a little bit
deeper than that kind of rosy but these
are all all of the formula across the
board is the same really creamy really
pigmented they're not a long wearing
liquid lipsticks so they're not gonna
dry down like I showed you before you're
going to see transfer you can't go kiss
it on someone because you're gonna see
it on their cheeks or lips whatever but
I just love it and so for me like I like
traveling when we were on our honeymoon
I think that's when I bought Oh Miley
the very first time and I just fell in
love and I we were looking through
pictures the other day of when we were
in Paris and I was like I wore this red
lipstick like every single day but it
photographed so well and it was
comfortable yes I had to reapply yes
everyone's my I would check in the
mirror to make sure but for the most
part there were no issues and it's just
I love it so much all right
so let's get into some drugstore ones as
well a foundation that has withstood the
test of time is the Rimmel lasting
finish foundation I remember loving this
years and years ago and I think that
this used to be in a squeezy tube I'm
yelling again quiet Jess this used to be
in a squeezy tube and it wasn't the same
colors but I loved it then and the
reason I knew this had to be the exact
same thing I think they used the same
name but it has this very specific smell
so again if you're sensitive to smell I
don't know cuz it definitely is obvious
but I don't mind this particular smell
but once you get it on you can smell it
while you're applying it but once it's
actually on your face I never smelled it
throughout the day but I just love this
it's a tea I would say medium coverage
you can definitely build it up I think
they call it full coverage but again
like I've always said pool coverage is
like 100% flawless almost like a thicker
foundation
and that's not how I view this but for
me this is usually about as max coverage
as I go but I can use this everyday I
can apply it with the brush my fingers a
Beautyblender sponge whatever it always
looks beautiful it stays on all day I
have pretty normal skin sometimes dry it
works for me if you have oily skin let
us know below if it works for you I
don't know what is this being overly
dewy or anything like that so I feel
like it probably would work for oily
skin as long as you may be used like a
good primer one that you know works
really well with your skin that may be
controlling the oil but I love this
stuff I just I know a lot of my Canadian
subscribers you guys told me the last
time I mentioned this I think this past
month you guys were like it's it's with
a pump in Canada and I'm like oh I wish
it was with a pump here but I wear the
shade just for reference 100 ivory
another product that has withstood the
test of time is this little wet and wild
single it's like two dollars in the
shade Brule I've mentioned it for years
because it's like the most pigmented
cheap shadow and it's perfect if you
have a skin tone similar to mine to
blend everything together it does a
great job of toning down other shadows
if you've like gone a little maybe
you're a little overzealous with a
darker shadow and you were like ooh
that's too much this does a great job of
kind of evening it out and blending it
but also kind of toning it down which I
appreciate it also looks great as just a
mat like brow bone kind of a highlight I
just love them all of their little
single shadows are fantastic but a lot
of them are kind of more satin or
shimmery and this one is matte and
wonderful and I've used it for years
this is probably the fourth or fifth one
of these that I've owned and it's just a
fantastic shadow and I use it probably a
couple times a week every week for years
next one is the I almost feel like I
could call this video like old school
YouTube favorites because almost all of
these as I was like picking them out I
thought these are all like ones that I
remember watching other youtubers like
way before I had a channel I remember
watching other youtubers talk about no
my car I need to buy it and so I would
like save up and buy it but these are
still so good and I still love them this
is the NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk this
is one that I know a lot of people have
trouble sharpening but I have not had
ooh I've used many different large
sharpeners and yes it does eat away a
lot of it as you sharpen it
but these aren't that expensive so I
never feel that bad but it's
specifically this shade milk is what was
super popular they have a million shades
but it's just this really very creamy
pencil but you can blend it and it's
awesome to put on your eye just all over
blended like this before you put shadow
on so a lot of people were using this
before like kind of squeezy regular eye
primers were popular this was one that
was affordable nowadays every brand
including drugstore has some kind of an
eye primer but for a while it was only
the really expensive brands that had
stuff that was useful and this was one
that was really popular because it was
affordable but it's also really good and
what's great about white primers like
this is any any color it doesn't have to
be a colorful eye look but any shadow is
going to pop a little bit more over the
white let me see if I can show you an
example I'm gonna put a little bit more
of it on there kind of blend it but I
want to be able to I want you to be able
to see it so I'm gonna pick a shadow I'm
gonna be talking about The Naked palette
so I'm gonna pick let's try ohhh stood
so I'm gonna get it on two of my fingers
here okay and I'm gonna put one beside
it in one over the white honestly I was
gonna say I feel like I've tried this
with shadows then it really pops over
that white but because this Naked
palette is so freaking good it doesn't
even matter with these shadows these are
so ridiculous so that was a really poor
example but well that's a really good
palette we'll talk about that palette
next but it's an awesome idea and I will
say with this white base it's really
good with drugstore eyeshadows cuz
though it's not always but oftentimes if
they're not super pigmented you know not
like The Naked palette if they're not
super pigmented they don't you know they
get kind of washed out this prevents
them from getting too washed out
hopefully that makes sense alright let's
talk the Naked palette I got rid of so
many palettes recently like probably out
of 50 palettes I think I kept like 15
and I didn't film it I think I mentioned
that I don't know if it was in a video
or a snap I was talking about it and how
I didn't film it I do covered my whole
collection without filming it and the
only reason was I realized that I do
better when I'm in one of those moods
from like I just need to purge and it's
like gonna be good for my soul and I
just know it I feel like I do so much
better on my own so the reality is I
will accumulate enough makeup and then
acts probably four or five months they
don't probably do into clutter again and
I'll film it cuz I do enjoy filming them
but I just wasn't in that kind of a mood
and I I wasn't in a filming mood and I
just needed to do it does that make
sense so I hope you can understand why I
didn't film it but I was looking at my
naked palettes and this time I kept all
three I think next time I might get rid
of the naked 3 let's talk for another
video but this palette is so good and
yes everyone's like all of the naked pal
like that's so you know cliche everyone
talked about but there's a reason
there's a reason it became so popular so
quickly and why it's still popular today
no one has really matched this palette
you know it's not only insanely
pigmented but the range is so cool and
it's just a good mix of colors it's one
that I find that I can do so much with I
love half-baked their shimmers are
amazing their mats are amazing I showed
you that toasted color but I'll show you
again because that's like one of my
absolute favorites
but I just feel like it's just the
prettiest palette and it's one that I've
owned this one for years it's probably
time to replace it but I've owned this
particular one for years and years and I
saved up so much for it and I was so
excited to get it and I'm clearly like I
have baby this like I would clean it off
I try to keep it clean I mean I have
babied this thing anyway I just think
the colors are gorgeous the quality is
amazing it blends seamlessly you just
can't do much better than this palette
you know there's other palettes out
there that I also like like V's art
makes amazing palettes as well but this
is just such a classic and I still use
it every single week at least once I
would say I'm reaching for this still
after years of owning it alright
continuing on another favorite is
another one from Rimmel but it's there
stay matte pressed powder this is such a
cult classic I've bought a million of
these I
they have transparent I always use your
zero for sandstorm they really don't
have a big range and most of them end up
being transparent anyway by the time you
actually put it on but they
this one that is the best the simplest
thinnest powder when it comes to just
getting rid of a little bit of excess
oil so I'll use this just right in my
t-zone and it soaks it up just enough
where it doesn't look super powdery but
it doesn't look like still oily so it
does the perfect amount of mattifying
that's why I appreciate it because I do
have dry skin so the rare times I'm like
ooh I'm a little bit way you know way
too oily or whatever in that area this
is what I want I don't want a really
heavy powder that's just gonna
accentuate the dry spots so I really
love this and it's so inexpensive
continuing on this is the Urban Decay
all nighter spray it's gone through
different transformations bottle wise I
like to liken this to the skin to Naevia
setting spray because they're they're
made from the same company I have to
assume they're pretty much the exact
same thing because I've used this and
the skin a navy one kind of
interchangeably and I never notice the
difference they're both so amazing they
really do hold on to your makeup but my
favorite thing is not only do I notice
my makeup does stay on longer that day
but I notice that like it it kind of
melts everything together so when I feel
like them looking a little splotchy or
maybe a little dry and cakey in some
areas spraying this on it I feel like
just kind of evens it all out and melts
it into itself so that it looks more
seamless and I love this I've bought so
many of these flash the Scandinavia one
they're so good if you haven't tried
these yet they're amazing all right
another drugstore one this one's from
NYX this is the mega shine lip gloss in
the shade say it with me
beige if you've been watching me a long
time you're like yeah we know it's the
only color you like it's in the shade
beige which is the pink color it has
just the right amount of pigment where
it looks gorgeous it makes your lips
look so healthy and just juicy but it
doesn't slide all around your face it's
not overly sticky it does have a cherry
smell but I just love this it's just
like this creamy milky gloss that just
looks so healthy like I said and every
time I wear it I feel like I'll catch
myself in the mirror be like dang like
your lip
look good and you didn't even try like
you just slapped on a gloss and it looks
great so I love love those love of the
stuff if you've been hearing me talk
about this for years and you still
haven't gone out and spent the I don't
know five dollars on this you've got to
try it I love this so much they were
discontinued this I will throw up this
is the benefit Dallas
blush box of powder they call it this in
the store like I had tried I think every
other benefit blush before I finally got
around to this one because it didn't
look appealing I'm like I don't know you
know girl on a horse is cute but the
color I was like it looks kind of boring
what is it a bronzer is it a blush
waters it and so I just kind of always
skipped over it whether it is online or
in-store they all have a smell it's very
subtle but I like the smells this turned
out to be the best blush ever it's the
kind that you just put on your face and
it just looks so neutral but in a pretty
way it doesn't look like you're trying
so hard like oh she's got bright pink
blush on her oh she's got bright peach
blush this is just the perfect everyday
blush where it just it always ends up
looking seamless and I'm like I know
it's not me cuz I'm not a makeup artist
it's this I'm telling you it's so
beautiful again this is one that I
reached for like once or twice a week
every single week for years and I have
to force myself to use other things
because if I could I would use this
every single day this is the blush that
I travel with a lot just because I it's
so foolproof it goes with absolutely
every look oh my gosh I love it so much
so I have had this a while it's probably
getting close to time for me to replace
it but I've heard rumors that this might
be discontinued please don't let it be
true I love it so much there's a swatch
of it by the way it's I mean you could
almost wear it as a bronzer but it ends
up looking just so beautiful just on
your cheeks as like a blush bronzer the
last thing I'm going to mention is the
balm
blushes these little bad boys again I've
bought oh my gosh so many of these over
the years and then eventually the balm
sent me some and so I got rid of some
that I already had and you know some of
these have lasted through the clutters
some I've gotten rid of and then
how they got in my possession again well
my original favorite sorry I'm cleaning
one of these off my original favorite
was this one
it was the down boy blush it was this
gorgeous pink these are so pigmented
so beautiful I just loved this blush now
this is a newer one cuz I had to
cluttered it long ago cuz I had it for
years well I fell in love with a new one
that I thought was worth mentioning
because while this kind of withstood the
test of time all of these blushes I've
always had one in my collection of some
kind because the formula B's is amazing
my favorite blush now from them is the
balm Beach blush it's this gorgeous
light peach so if you're a similar skin
tone to mine you will love it
again it doesn't look that special but
it goes on seamlessly you don't have to
work at it it doesn't get splotchy it's
so beautiful the other one I currently
have that I really I think I've
literally only swatched is this frat-boy
blush and it's a lot more you can see
kind of a melon color right there
gorgeous even prettier if you have a
deeper skin tone um hi Pinocchio don't
grab that makeup pinoke leave it good
boy so long story short the formula
these is amazing those these generally
have withstood the test of time but the
bomb Beach is definitely my new favorite
they do have other shades too and I
always buy these on HauteLook because
they're like ten dollars on there when
the balm is on sale there otherwise
these are like 20 something dollars so
that's definitely the place to buy it I
will link it below so those are all of
my favorite products from over the years
if you enjoyed this video like I said
