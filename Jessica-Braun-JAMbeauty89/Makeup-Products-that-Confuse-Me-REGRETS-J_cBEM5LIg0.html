a video it's kind of a product I regret
buying but these are all products that
gathered that I don't understand them
like I don't know how they were meant to
be used in a way that makes any sense
and so I thought this was kind of a fun
video I'm gonna tell you right now it's
going to be negative that's the nature
of a video like this so if you clicked
on it and then you're like oh my gosh
she's so negative well duh so if you
don't like negative videos you might
want to go watch another one of mine
they're not all like this of course but
if you enjoy the style of video of
course give it a thumbs up all in good
fun it's just makeup
other than that I hope you'll subscribe
let's go ahead and get into it alright
the first product I don't understand
I've got a two okay
in all fairness my dog Pinocchio just
shooed this up it was like in a pile
ready to be talked about in a video and
he just came in stole it this is this
glittery beauty sponge I love beauty
sponges it actually feels like it might
be a good sponge however there's a
glitter in it and even when I just do
this I am seeing little bits of glitter
come off now it's not like a ton of
glare however this is marketed as like a
highlighting sponge what so am I
supposed to only put it here and then
there's also gonna be glitter with
whatever highlighter that I'm blending
in like the theory behind this makes
absolutely no sense to me I could use a
regular sponge and if I were blending in
say a cream highlight with the sponge
which I do often I'm gonna use a regular
sponge because one that has glitter in
it that has the chance of the glitter
falling off I very rarely want a
highlighter that has glitter in it so
why would I want that in this so this is
only marketed to someone that loves
glitter in their highlight I guess I
mean I don't know it just sounds like a
really dumb idea that I don't know what
you know maybe they thought I don't know
just a bad idea a bad idea that brings
me to the next one sorry I'm like
sneezing up a storm over here don't mind
me the next one this it was in the same
I think it was in the same pack that
they sent me these it's this like a
silicone sponge but again there's like
glitter trapped in it now the glitter is
cute on this because the glitters not go
anywhere it's inside the actual silicone
so at least it's cute but it's not
getting everywhere cool I like that
there's like this little thing that you
can put your fingers between except for
if you've ever used the silicone sponge
so this is not me knocking elf only this
is me knocking any of these silicone
sponges these don't make any sense
if you've ever used it it'd be like
taking what's it similar to well it's
like taking anything and just going like
this like put foundation all over the
side of this and just rub it into your
skin that's how this ends up working the
nice thing is ya know it doesn't soak up
any of the product however you're just
rubbing it around why not use your
fingers why not use freakin anything it
doesn't make I don't know so if you've
found a way to use these in a way that
makes sense to you good for you I've
tried many brands I've tried many ways
and none of it it's way more work than
it needs to be so I ended up using this
like I would just put my foundation on
it and then use my brush or my Beauty
Blender to tap onto it so it's kind of
like my little painter's palette instead
of my hand I was just using this cuz I
was like might as well use it for
something admit there are a couple elf
products in here but there are some
other brands let's talk about Too Faced
I have two two face products that I was
like first one is the two feet to feast
sweetiepie radiant matte bronzer soak
that in for a second radiant matte
bronzer so I'm like okay so I open it
now of course I've already ruined it
because there was like this glitter gold
overspray that I was like what why would
anyone want that
so I've already swatched it enough that
that overspray is gone so it is this
matte bronzer is it radiant maybe I mean
it really is just a member on xur I
could see maybe there's a little bit of
light kind of glitter in it and so that
brings me to the next point radiant and
matte those are like opposites now I
will say this this is kind of a theme in
this
you're gonna see this radiant matte idea
one of my favorite highlighters if not
my absolute favorite is this Laura
Mercier matte radiance baked powder and
I do absolutely adore this and while the
name is like what it really is kind of
radiant and matte because it's very
subtle I would say it's more radiant
than matte because it is so highlighter
I put this on top of another highlighter
that I tried it's I use this like every
single day so I can get past the name
except for the overspray on the Too
Faced one made no sense and now it
really is just matte so calling it a
matte radiance makes no sense to me so
it was just one of those things that I
was like it's an okay bronzer I've used
it a couple times but the waffle like
the basket weave is really really cute
but then there's the pink in there so
I'm like so eventually I'm gonna really
start hitting down into the pink parts
is that gonna end up looking more like a
blush like how should I use this so just
one of those products that I feel like
they put too many ideas together reminds
me of like all those two-faced like the
leopard different like bronzer blush
things that were also glittery and I
actually think I have all of them and
I'm like I don't know how to use any of
these they were sent to me and I've
gotten rid of them before I'm gonna get
rid of them again because they're just
so much all in one product that but you
have to use it all at the same time but
I'm like I don't like it like I'd rather
have a blush I like and a highlighter I
like any bronzer I like next product
from Too Faced was this it was the Too
Faced I want candy collection I love
candy Johnson I think she is an amazing
youtuber an amazing person inside and
out and I liked some products from her
collection however I think if she were
completely and I don't know I don't know
how the behind the scenes works with all
this stuff but I know that there's only
so much control that someone you know
working with the company there's only so
much control they have there are certain
pricing limitations ingredient
limitations they're just limitations and
I think if candy had complete control I
think a lot of the products would have
been different
and maybe better anyway but like I said
I'm not I don't know all the ins and
outs this when you first watch it is
lutely stunning the way they describe
this they call it a Luminizer so you
know it's meant to be I would assume
this as a stick highlighter and it is
pretty
however there's genuine bits of glitter
in this that when I wore it the few
times I did you know you blend it out
and it's so pretty
but the glitter the glitter gets
everywhere and so it was just one of
those things I'm like come on it's got
the cutest packaging its watches
beautifully the shade is really pretty
but it's so got this bits of glitter and
it stinks because you know even just
watching it you can barely see it but
the second you get it on your face it's
as if throughout the day the highlight
kind of wears away and all that's left
behind is that glitter and it looks
crazy it looks crazy so I was really sad
this is definitely gonna be declutter
for my collection because it's just one
that fool me once shame on me fool me
twice there's glitter all over my face
all right the next product is from
origins this is a ooh this is a very
famous product of theirs it's their
ginseng tinted moisturizer I remember
having this on a wish list like years
ago when I first heard like other
youtubers have mouths like oh my gosh
that sounds amazing it's like it sent
some oyster eyes or it kind of matches
to your skin
oh this stuff looks so patchy on my face
it's crazy it made me think okay I know
my skin is not perfect not even close
but is it that bad that it looks that
patchy so I've applied it with my
fingers cuz I figure you know that makes
sense for a tinted moisturizer and it's
kind of this like creamy almost
pistachio colored stuff but you blend it
in like a lotion all over your face and
it has what they call a sheer tint
release and so it ends up kind of
blending into your skin adding a little
bit of color to it perfecting it just a
little bit however when I put it on it
just looked crazy it was like orange and
like you know the spot around your brows
it was like orange around there you know
it would just be patchy especially
around my hairline and I was trying to
be really good about
lending all that and I would even grab a
sponge and try to fix it so in the end I
was able to fix it but I was like okay
if I'm using a tinted moisturizer I
don't have that much time to be fussing
that much I'd rather use a BB cream that
I love or something and not even worry
about it so this is something that I
think I've used maybe four or five times
that every time no matter what
moisturizer or primer anything I put
under it it didn't seem to matter but I
still because it's so famous and so many
people like I still want to keep trying
it in different ways and see if I can
find a way to make it work I will say it
kind of looks nice over that a really
shimmery I wiped off the Too Faced I
want candy stick but I feel like it's
still there so it looks really pretty
doesn't it anyway I don't know you guys
let me know if you found a way to like
use this and love it because I'm I'm
just so curious I think I found a way to
explain it it's as if like the edge of
wherever you put it dries and you can
see a line whereas I feel like with
foundation you can kind of blend it to
the point where it blends right into it
but with this stuff like once it dries
it's there and then it starts changing
color whereas at least the foundation
you see the color as you're doing it so
it's just trickier to work with the next
product is from L'Oreal it's their
infallible Pro blow powder what do they
call it Demi glow finish half of this is
a powder and half of it is a glittery
sort of highlight this is in the shade
22 creamy natural I don't think they
even have a lighter shade than this so
they really don't go light enough for my
skin tone but you can kind of mix them
together it's just a mediocre powder but
on top of that it has that glitter half
so when I played it to my face yet again
glitter everywhere I don't know why
companies are still putting like pure
glitter into things I don't know who's
really in the market for that I don't
know if they're assuming that we're dumb
enough to think that glitter is what
makes everything look shimmery whereas
you know there are so many amazing
products that have no glitter but they
have that beautiful glow everyone's
wanting that beautiful glow most people
are not wanting glitter all over their
face to achieve that globe
other ways to make that kind of a
product so I'm sure it's a cheaper way
to do that maybe and that's maybe why
they're do it I don't know it just
doesn't add up to me very odd product
can't figure out what I'm supposed to do
with it I don't get it
next product I used to love I will admit
I use this for like two months and I
loved it I don't know if this has gone
bad or whatever but this is the second
one of these I've owned it's the
Clinique peps start hydro blur
moisturizer and it's this really kind of
cool feeling moisturizer it's very like
whipped kind of and very very poor
filling and that's why I loved it it was
moisturizing this pore filling but I've
noticed now and I've had this second one
for a while and that's why I think well
maybe it's gone bad but it just pills up
so much no matter what I use it with in
any way it still does that and so I'm
like okay so you're not doing your job
you're not moisturizing and staying
where I need you you're ending up like
I'll put either like with the sponge or
with the brush put foundation on and
that stuff is going everywhere whether I
use a primer with it or not it's just I
don't know so if you've tried this
recently and you've noticed the same
thing maybe they've reformulated or
maybe this one has gone bad or maybe
it's been like this all along but I was
somehow lucky the first few months I
used that first one I don't know
but mmm also it's really stormy here and
it's kind of Awesome so the next product
is another elf one and it is their aqua
Beauty shadows and this is in the shade
Island breeze
cool idea okay so the idea is that
they're these kind of creamy in a way
like color pop shadows but not nearly as
creamy I don't know how else to explain
it now look at that color that's
redonkulous then it's so beautiful but
the other colors I just felt very like
underwhelmed by you can't even barely
see them and then there's this weird
like yellowy chartreuse which is super
punchy but I'm like I don't know what
I'm gonna wear that but then there's
this weird like white one that like
blends to not
and yet again has glitter suspended in
it so I just felt like these like how do
you wear them are you supposed to put
them all over your lid do you apply them
with your fingers that's how I've tried
it you certainly can't use a brush
because they don't go anywhere so then
I'll put it on my lid and try to blend
it with the brush and that'll work okay
but most of these are so kind of crummy
that I'm like I can't like any of the
ones that I would want to blend I can't
and then like this one looks really I
will say this one if they sold it as a
single top notch a beautiful color it I
mean it's freaking gorgeous but all the
rest of them I was just like what so
again just kind of a I don't know I
don't really know how this got through
testing with most of the shades other
than like those two being really bad I
mean just patchy don't really stay on
long they're not easy to blend they
don't really even just go on at all it's
just a weird weird product all right
next one the elf aqua primer mist just
watch okay it probably didn't do it
justice this stuff squirts out at you at
a million miles an hour that
exaggeration was just about dead-on a
million miles an hour and it's your face
is freaking soaked and it takes forever
for it to dry I have tried it from like
this far away like I've tried everything
so that I'm like okay so then I'll just
kind of push it in with my fingers that
doesn't really help and then I'm like
well now I'm just mixing the gross
that's on my finger I don't know so I
just feel like there's no good way to
use this and if this is supposed to
replace a primer I don't have that long
like I've got a minute or two to let the
primer sink in but this is taking like
three to four minutes so then I'm
Fanning it and I'm like I could be doing
something else with my hands right now
while it seems like I don't know so I
just felt like just a silly product way
too difficult to work with do I think it
held onto my foundation anymore no I
really don't it's just I think it's
maybe a little gimmicky and just not
very good and the nozzle is terrible so
those were all of the products that I
don't really get that I I just was not
impressed with I think they're kind of
weird I don't know
the brand was thinking I hope that you
enjoyed this title of video I know it
was really is that a word
really super negative but they're always
fun it's just fun to talk about makeup
and so I would love to know what
products you maybe we're confused by
that you really didn't like let us all
know down below we can get a
conversation going other than that I
hope you'll subscribe and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
