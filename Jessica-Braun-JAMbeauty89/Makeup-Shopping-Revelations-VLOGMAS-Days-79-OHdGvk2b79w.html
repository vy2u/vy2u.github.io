December 7th and I am headed into work
school is out and chew in a minute sorry
you like still have coffee okay so I'm
gonna go get my hair trimmed cuz it
certainly needs a trim and I just go to
great clips I feel like everyone I know
like spends a lot of money at nice
salons but I've never dyed my hair so I
don't have to worry about that and I
really just trim it like I have them
like do long layers and just keep the
dead ends off and that's pretty much it
the problem with my hair is that
sometimes I wear it straight sometimes I
wear it like curl from the curling wand
sometimes I wear it wavy sometimes I
wear naturally curly so like it's I have
to be able to do in so many ways that if
I get too specific of a cut it would
mess too much with the one style versus
the other so I just keep it really
simple so I can wear my hair in a lot of
ways so I like go to great clubs because
it's so much cheaper in it always is
exactly what I want so um why am i
defending myself there there's no reason
to defend yourself just calm down so
that's where I'm headed now and then I'm
hoping to be able to go to all these
because we're doing a canned food drive
at school and I promised my students the
pizza party if we get a certain number
of cans and we you need a lot more by
the time we leave for Christmas break so
I need to donate a bunch too so um
that's what I'm planning on doing and
then I know Tyler's plan and I'm putting
up a new TV today that we got for our
office like filming area because we're
both in there so much you know be so
nice to have like the news on be able to
watch it in there so that we can
actually like edit videos from our desk
versus always sitting like on the couch
or at the kitchen table so anyway so
that is kind of the agenda for the night
all right he's getting up there how's it
going time
we bought a kind of cheap um what does
it called mount yeah and we regret that
decision
my hands are too big to fit where I have
10 and I tried to move but I I got like
the thing on but I think I did it
crooked so you know no no it's gonna be
nice though hi Nene boy like I want to
show you guys my little pink is sparkly
Nutcracker I found it online recently
there's actually a whole look you guys
know I'm obsessed of that website but
it's so cute I was like oh my gosh I
have to I have to but it's got like the
little Nutcracker ballerina and
everything and here's that train I told
you guys I bought at the Dollar Tree
it really does work really well for this
so then this is our cake topper a
subscriber sent this to us it's a little
music box and we use it on our wedding
cake so Tyler Saladin we're watching our
favorite show Bob's burger Kristen so
well one of like 15 favorite shows but I
love this freaking how'd he do put the
room back together
and I'll get to watch youtube videos up
there that's right excited weirdo I know
I'm not alone though so that's where'd
this come from
I'm sure you know get this Evan I bet he
got out of that oh I had it on the couch
what a stinker what's he doing what are
you doing Shane fm I'm up to nothing I'm
gonna mess with moms editing good
morning so I'm like halfway done doing
my makeup and I I wanted to share with
you guys what I've been addicted to on
YouTube I can't stop watching minimalist
makeup collections and there's not like
a ton online but I keep finding all
these youtubers that have done these and
basically they've gone from collections
like I have to much smaller collections
which I have to cluttered a lot and I
know I get a lot of questions from you
guys like why are you two cluttering you
keep hauling like it doesn't add up it
doesn't make sense but I know that a lot
of you guys understand that because
YouTube really is one of my jobs
it it's imperative that I continue to
buy new things to try out to review
because that's what my channel is that's
why I created it so for me I'm always
going to be hauling which is why I feel
that I always have to be decluttering as
well because if I see that there's a new
lipstick line out that I want to review
for you guys for my channel and so I buy
four shades of it and after I filmed
that video and shared my knowledge and
experience with it with you guys
if I feel like I don't like any of them
or maybe I only liked one of the shades
on me then now that I've done you know
now that those products have served
their purpose I feel that I can pass
them on and not feel guilty about it
because for me it's kind of a business
expense if you will and I know that to
some people that makes no sense but to a
lot of you guys it does but that's just
the reality of kind of my life right now
so I know that and I feel good about
that so that's fine I mean they really
that's all that matters but I wanted to
try and make that clear to some of you
guys but anyway wow that tangent just to
say that I love watching these because I
know I'll probably never be down to a
really really a collection that fits in
like one makeup bag but I just like
seeing it it's there's something weird
weirdly satisfying about looking at a
collection that's just just like what I
used to have when I was you know like in
high school I just had a makeup bag with
makeup I mean that's what most people
have I know that but when you've tried
so many things and you keep things for
you know reviews and things it really
just can't be overwhelming to have a lot
of makeup so anyway speaking of having a
lot of makeup I got this in the mail
from Too Faced and I was like tearing up
because Too Faced makes some of my
favorite eyeshadow ever and it was I'm
just so excited I'm hoping to have time
to do a video soon on this but it's
there bon bons palette and it's got all
these different colors and it's got like
the hearts and stuff a lot of lighter
neutral colors in it which you know I
like I'm wearing it today I haven't put
liner on so I know it doesn't look
awesome but it's just kind of like washi
looks you can do you can do darker looks
too there's some darker colors but I've
only gotten to play with it yesterday
and today but I'm really liking it so
far plus I just like that it smells like
chocolate mmm
anyway so what day is it
today Tuesday who is gonna be a long
week it's Tuesday so we'll see how today
goes so work is done for the day and I
worked out it was hard to get here and I
was not motivated but I did so I'm glad
that's kind of the update for right now
I need to go home Tyler didn't have to
work today so he's been doing some
things around town so he's not home yet
so Pinocchio hasn't been out in a while
so I'm gonna go home and take him out a
little rent so I bought this bottle of
Pellegrino which is just sparkling water
when we returned from France after our
honeymoon because they had it like
everywhere and everyone just drank it
constantly and so we drank it there and
we were like this is kind of weird but
kind of good so I bought it when we
first got back and I'm like that would
just be fun to have just to have every
once in a while cuz it was just
something different than water but
totally is water but it's just a little
bit different so I am just not opening
it tonight and I just retried and it
really is it's so weird but it's like
refreshing at the same time it's if
you've never tried it you gotta try it
at least once to decide like if you like
it or not but I honestly forgot about
it's been sitting in our fridge for
awhile and to go with my Pellegrino I
just made a bunch of stovetop popcorn
and time and I heat ground up some salt
to make it even like finer milled
so that way it sticks in the key is to
put it on the kernels just a little bit
because I don't like a lot of salt but I
do put a little bit and if you put it on
the kernels as it's starting to cook it
sticks to it better so at least that's
what we've kind of noticed so mmm my
favorite snacks so I've got a couple of
things cooking I made an herbed chicken
and then I'm also making those are like
honey and parsley and one other thing
paro parsley thyme honey and apple cider
vinegar on the carrots so they're gonna
be baked so they're almost they're all
almost done um and then I'm making some
brown rice there so people came together
and time there's almost home so it kind
of worked out so we're sitting down to
dinner I just got home this dinner looks
amazing that Jessica made turned out
okay miss Clary except watch watch
dinner but uh I just came from my
parents house I just went through my
closet at my parents house
right have a ton of stuff and only
brought over a few things but that's a
good feeling I've just been hanging over
my ass look at all the stuff you burped
we have got some work to do I'm tired
yeah hey guys okay so it's Wednesday and
what is that December 9th and it's just
been quite a day which is why I have
logged it all today not a bad day just a
long one and I kind of woke up late
again it's so hard to wake up in the
mornings when it's I don't know like
cozy in bed but I am gonna go home for a
sec and then Tyler and I are going to go
grocery shopping so I'm really excited
because we need like I'm just we're in
need of fruit we don't have any in the
house and I love fruit but we also just
need some more fresh vegetables and
cereal we need cereal just things like
that but we also are having his family
over this weekend for our Christmas
celebration before some of us go to
London so we are doing the meal for that
so we need to make sure we have all the
ingredients and things like that so that
is our plan for the night we'll probably
vlog at the store I just thought of
something I was going through like my
day just now in my head and I thought
gosh like I feel like today was a
whirlwind and then I didn't get any of
the like big things that I usually get
done by Wednesday in my work week I feel
like I haven't gotten those done but
then I was like wait a minute what did I
get done and so then I started listing
off all the things that got done and
even if they were small things they were
still things that got done and suddenly
I realized oh my gosh I actually on a
day that I thought like not was a waste
but like I feel like I didn't get done
when I needed to get done I got done
with a ton of other things so it made me
feel bad and I wanted to share that with
you guys it's such a simple thing that
I've never really done before but now I
want to do everyday because it made me
feel like okay I actually did get a lot
of things done and the reason the other
things weren't done was because I was
getting these other things done so try
that today or on a day that maybe you
feel like you didn't get done with
everything you wanted list off
things you did get done no matter how
small even if it was as small as like
for me I needed to email a parent back
so I got that done and no that only took
no that didn't take a long time it only
took a couple minutes but that was
something that was on my plate that I
got off of my plate so just little
things like that um I just wanted to
share that with you guys some chicken
tonight with some broccoli
so it's broccoli Zuko in some boiling
water and then it goes into ice water
which is crazy so it literally stops the
cooking process then right before you
about to cook it you put it in a skillet
and do it with olive oil and salt and
pepper so you can very excited to try it
I've never tried it that way before
should be a good dinner I'm excited to
try to do all right yeah I feel like
with broccoli I always either it's
perfect or it's terrible like well and
it's so hit or miss I could do the same
way two nights in a row and it wouldn't
matter no when this broccoli does have
for about a week and a half so it's not
gonna be the best anyway but I figured
it to be good way to try that process
yeah
no key oh it's really good we'll let you
guys know do you need to go potty all
right good boy ringing the bells okay so
look at this bear isn't he ever so
familiar like I feel like he's so old
school and I can't believe he's still
around golden crisps I'm picking out a
cereal right now we decided we had liked
for a while like five Siros we were like
this is too much so we're each we
finally like eaten all of our cereal we
probably 0 like once a week but I love
cereal so I'm thinking about vanilla
chucks they're so good the sugar is not
low but they're so good guys do we get
them maybe
maybe or that or that
I'm so torn okay so we're tired we're
about to eat dinner and just it's yeah
8:20 I'm ready to go - ready - our go to
go 9:00 p.m. we need to bed at 11:00
last night way past my bedtime
I'm serious if it's 8:30 it's late
