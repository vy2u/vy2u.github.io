different video and it's gonna be more
vlog style I'm actually cleaning out my
makeup collection because I was relaxing
in the other room and Tyler's gonna be
filming in the kitchen so I was like
well what can I do and I read a book for
a while I'm actually reading The
Outsiders by se Hinton so my students
are reading it in a literal group and so
I'm rereading it again anyway so I read
that for a while and I was like gosh I
don't have any papers to grade my lesson
plans are done and I'm looking around
and laundry's going the dishes are done
I'm like I feel like decluttering that
is something that is fun to me and I do
it all the time so I've decluttered my
makeup collection a billion times but it
continues to accumulate since this is
one of my jobs but I also just have hair
stuff and just all kinds of things that
somehow have been in my little drawer
systems here I'll kind of show it to you
I've already pulled a lot out um but
there's just a long ways to go and I
think there's a lot of things that
either need to go in a different spot in
our apartment or just need to be gone I
mean they don't need to stay here so
I'll kind of take you along for parts of
this journey if you'll come along with
me then that'd be great let's go so
right now I have some like mail over
there like I've got an Ipsy bag and
glossy box and things that I got out of
the way but everything else on here they
just bend in random drawers so I just
took everything out so the top drawers
here are empty and I'm going to wipe
them clean with Lysol wipes because some
of them like this is so gross there's
like little like white book from a hair
one of my like little hair cream things
that like spill so I'm going to clean
these out really well before I put stuff
back in them I got rid of a lot of my
organizers because I'm using the ones
that I have and everything else that I
had extra I got rid of because I
realized that I was holding on to them
and they were taking up like an entire
drawer of space and I was like if I
don't need them now I'm never going to
need them so I pass those along but I
still kept a couple but I use them
sometimes when I feel
but I don't have to have them so I think
I'm just going to get rid of them I
might keep this but I need to redo this
because it's got random skincare but I
also have skincare elsewhere so I want
to compile those together but then I've
just got random things like this bag
like why am i keeping this bag and I've
got computer paper these need to go over
by the printer
I've got empties but with my empties
I've also got like a sunglass case I'm
like why is that in there and like
drawer liners that I'm not using maybe
I'll use them so I'm really excited to
really get going
so this drawer down here I've emptied
all the other ones above this and wiped
them out this is what I call like my
Travel drawer because it's got I mean
Tyler and I travel a lot so it's got
like a portable charging bank and any
travel-sized toiletries my like speakers
the little case for them and a travel
pillow so all kinds of things that I
feel like I probably a don't use all of
this so I might be able to get rid of
some of it like I've got two power banks
i when I got this in a fabfitfun box I
was so excited because I couldn't find
this I finally found it so I'm like well
now I've got two so this is something
that I could give to a family member
that maybe doesn't have one so I'm
thinking this is one thing I can get rid
of I'm going to have to start a pile
maybe here on the floor like this could
be a gift to a family member and then
there's going to be like a just
straight-up giveaway or throwaway type
pile so that might have to be how we do
this because I also got some other
travel size things recently preparing
for our trip to London I got this bag
the brand is Kestrel trying to do this
one-handed and this bag is pretty cool
because it opens first of all it's my
favourite colour pink but it's kind of
like a purplish pink but it's going to
be great for toiletries
I would think especially since we'll be
gone for like a week and a half almost
two weeks but since I have this that
means there might be other bags that
I've kept all along that I no longer
need so I'm I've been pretty good so far
about my makeup not keeping too much but
I need to be better about my other
accessories - hi handsome what are you
gonna cook tonight um
gonna do a chocolate torte I think my
own little spin on it and then I think
I'm gonna make some kind of tapas I
don't know I don't know we'll see see
what happens
well have fun I'm excited I see it I'm
ready also what again mind you up that
today is the day 14th
well but I don't know when this is going
up well but today is mm-hmm the day oh I
thought you were gonna say before you
say I'm like oh hey you proposed to me
laughs yeah now me what your anniversary
from an engagement day that's right
so anywho well like as if that's not
important and I took writing Skyline
Chili so he's a pretty big day for us a
big day that's all
um I love Skyline Chili so I'm making if
you've never had these your life is
about to be blown the oh I forgot I
threw like other things I had in here
this is like when I want like special
coffee in our Keurig I always do these
but I've tried the French vanilla ones
or the vanilla latte they're my favorite
but I still have cappuccino left and I
also have like the mocha ones where you
like this is the coffee part but then
you put like this froth packet which is
just like powder stuff in your mug the
coffee brews on top of it you mix it and
it is the most wonderful thing but once
I run out of all of this I'm going to
buy just the vanilla one because it's
the best but I'm just going to have a
regular cappuccino because it's gonna be
a while before we eat but we already ate
like earlier it's just like a weird like
our lunch was at a different time than
normal
etc so I am excited to have one I always
laugh at the noise that it makes and
also I was just thinking that you might
think that this video is sponsored like
by that coffee brand no it's not it just
like crossed my mind that someone might
think that no they know I just love this
coffee it's not anyway look at the mug I
chose Nikki's everywhere I'm pretty sure
every mug we own might involve Disney in
some way not all of them most though
Tyler right what's that looking at our
mugs a lot of them are dirty yeah like I
think all but maybe one or two does not
involve Mickey in some in some or Disney
in some capacity I'm
I ain't mad at got my cappuccino now
we're back in business so I'm just
pulling all of this stuff out of here to
see what I want to keep them what I want
to get rid of so everything over there
are travel things that I'm going to get
rid of like I've got a little pill box
that I need to take some of them out of
there but it's it's falling apart and
just things I don't use like my old
Magic Band I could I might keep because
it does say Jessica be on there so I
might keep it but I'm going to keep it
elsewhere so I'm going to move that but
everything else I'm either going to pass
on to a sister like this is a jewelry
role I love it it's Ted Baker it's
beautiful but it's kind of one of those
things that I never need to bring this
much jewelry on a trip so it's awesome
in theory but I I'm just I don't think
I've ever brought them achieve it on my
honeymoon I brought this and I brought
it but it took up a lot of room for you
know really I was only wearing like
three or four of the pieces so to
prevent over packing I'm just gonna get
rid of it so just in little bags that I
just don't need anymore I've got plenty
of so this drawer is now going to be
just my packing cubes which I've got
some packing cubes down there makeup
bags I've got smaller ones cause like
some of these I use just to bring makeup
brushes etc this is a special Disney one
of your Bradley Disney this is a laundry
bag I bring and then this is a travel
pillow and then in this Shore I kind of
basically spaced out my travel stuff so
now I corralled all of my toiletries
into here and I got rid of some I've
actually gotten rid of like a whole
drawer full of toiletries so this is all
that I kept and then just other things
that are maybe only for specific trips
like these are some European plugs to
adapt to what I'm used to it's just some
like Disney specific things back there a
little hairdryer that I only bring when
I know there's not going to be a
hairdryer there and then just like some
empty travel bottle I just went through
my makeup brushes I've recently
decluttered a ton of these but I went
through and I'm getting rid of some more
I've got a lot that I was keeping
because like everyone talked about
morphe so I bought a bunch of these
brushes and they were okay but I've got
plenty and I know that some of my
sisters would love to have some of these
so I'm keeping the ones that I really
love and what I asked myself as I
started going through all of this was I
basically looked at the pile and I
pulled out anything
and I would buy again so everything over
here are things that I like well enough
that I would purchase them again that I
know that I'm using all of the time or
at least often enough that I know the
brush as well a lot of these are brushes
I have never ever used that came with
stuff or they're ones that I need to
replace like this elf simple brush has
seen better days I love this brush but
I've used it for years and it's just
time for me to buy a new one they're
only like three dollars so stay with the
elf small stipple brush so a lot of
these have been well-loved and it's just
their time to go like this Real
Techniques sponge is a mess I've tried
to use it and I I think I waited too
long to clean it once and it's just I
need to buy a new one so that's a good
feeling so all of this I know what I've
got here and I feel really confident in
the things that I'm keeping you so I
just filmed an entirely separate makeup
declutter video kind of spontaneously
because I realized this video was going
to be too long so if you want to see my
process of getting rid of all of this
makeup and what makeup I kept I will
link that on the screen and also below
but now kind of fast-forward I've done
all that I've got my makeup organized
into these two drawers here and these
shores here and you'll see that enough
oh not even oh that's right my top
drawer is that lip so now I'm working on
just like cleaning still but going
through my hair stuff that I have a lot
of like I've got a two hair sprays but I
know I'm not really a big fan of this
but I want to use it up but I do like
the Tresemme a lot 3 texturizing spray
to lotion sprays curl cream some dry
shampoos and things that I might pass on
or just move to my bathroom like those
so like in the shampoo conditioner
doesn't make sense to be in here I'm
going to move it to my bathroom so
getting rid of some stuff here and going
to reorganize and I might not even put
it back in this drawer this is like a
permanent stain from nail polish remover
I'm like great so that stinks these are
all things I haven't opened that are
either not the right shade that
companies sent me I haven't opened yet
or just back up the things that I
purchased that I really like so this I
need to go through as well so right off
the bat I know I don't use this elf
daily moisture stick so that can go I'm
getting rid of a couple other things
like this
you like thing this ava NYC stuff is
good but i it's too heavy
on my hair some of the stuff i might
move to the bathroom like I mentioned
others I just need to find a better way
to organize it but like this can go in
my dry finishing spray actually I guess
I could stay with this actually it might
might put it my travel stuff so what I'm
doing is I'm picking like one hairspray
one leave-in treatment like a heat
protectant one texturizing spray one dry
shampoo this stuff is amazing these are
like the two things I use to curl my
hair there everything else is going to
be like a backup so I'm going to keep it
in a separate drawer but these will be
like in my top drawer up there so I can
reach them really quickly and easily and
then the rest will be like I said just
kind of in a separate drawer so when I
run out of like say the dry shampoo I'll
go and grab the next one in line if you
will I don't want to have all these
backups but these are all really good
and I don't want to get rid of them just
because I have more than one because
I'll definitely use these up so down
here I've just got all my backups and
then I even put like my brushes and a
the only straightener I have I don't use
it often but it's back there
and then up here I've just got my
everyday things that I'll be using this
is a traveling brush cup I'm realizing I
need to put my travel thing these two
things I can get rid of I no longer use
so those are going to go in the get rid
of pile this I think I'm going to ask
Tyler if he wants to use it for anything
if not I'm going to pass it on to a
family member that might want it so let
me put this in the travel do I want to
fit this it'll fit well in there it
could kind of just go on top here well
now that works out pretty well actually
so at this point I'm done I actually
have quite a few drawers that are
completely empty this one just has like
a thing a lighter to light a candle but
the top one I've got just hair stuff
that I'm going to be using daily which I
do use all this daily nothing in these
three this one here has nail polish
stuff I didn't
show because I've gone through it a
million times so I've just got like hand
sanitizer back there I've got swatches
on my hand from the makeup declutter
some hand creams little tools and then
just the nail polish down here I've got
my makeup brushes in there but I already
went through here I've got my travel
drawn and travel drawer number two you
already saw this drawer down here at the
bottom has my planner and planner
supplies this is like a project for
another day I do want to go through but
everything I've kind of already gone
through so it's all stuff I use all the
time but I might end up splitting it up
into more than one drawer but it's I
it's light and I'm now very very tired
and then up here this is my everyday
makeup drawer that I need to refill now
that I have put everything out back into
my collection since I just went through
it other than a couple of things there
um then so this is this Shore you're
getting a sneak peek at the makeup
collection and then here I've got my
backup hair stuff here I just have my
curling wand back there and then my
hairdryer over here lip stuff I need to
get like wd-40 for these drawers face
stuff this is just like hand towels that
I use to wipe up the mess I make when I
do my makeup and just makeup wipes then
here I just have some backups for myself
and then skin care lashes it's kind of a
random drawer but at least I know what's
in it and I know that I use all of this
stuff and then down here is just where
I'm going to keep stuff that I got in
the mail that I need to film about so
like if see and glossy box I always do
and then these are just my empties so
I've got a place to actually keep them
and then the top of my table top is I
mean it is what it is and then I always
have my iPad over here which I need a
clean and then I need to put these away
but I'm just excited that now I've just
got a ton of stuff that I just need to
pass on and other than that I think even
my organizers I'm going to pass on but
other than that I feel really good about
getting rid of all of this stuff
- ochio high blood
nice timing he's so cute so hopefully
that was enjoyable to watch I know it
was kind of spur the moment and now at
this point when I started I was so
gung-ho and now I'm just kind of tired
so hopefully you gained something from
it I know I really like watching other
people declutter anything just because
it's such a good feeling that I know and
so I know it's just fun to watch other
people go through the same thing so if
you enjoyed please subscribe I will link
any of my other declutter videos I have
an entire playlist down below and up
there on the screen and I'll catch you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
