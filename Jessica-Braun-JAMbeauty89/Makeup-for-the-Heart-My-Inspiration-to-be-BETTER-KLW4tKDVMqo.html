have a very different video for you guys
this is a video about what inspires me
and it was prompted because this girl
named wing contacted me and she has a
YouTube channel on here and she was just
talking about maybe doing a collab and
so that I was checking out her channel
and I found this video that she called
make up for the heart and it was really
a cool video and I'll link it below
because she was sitting on the beach and
it just even like kind of an impromptu
video and she was just talking about how
you know people are so not okay with the
way they look and they always want to
change something they always want to be
perfect and you know she said there
needs to be something about you know
making your heart and your soul
beautiful and not just your outer beauty
and this is something you know you hear
talked about and people talk about all
the time you know you know there's inner
beauty and it's way more beautiful than
what's on the outside but you know
society and the media seems to lean the
other way no matter what people say it's
all around you in magazines on TV the
only people you see are beautiful and if
someone is not as conventionally
beautiful as another its touted like wow
good for them and that they're putting
actors that aren't totally beautiful in
these shows and in these lead roles like
that should not be a thing that
shouldn't be a thing that people say oh
wow they're they're really progressive
because they're putting ugly people in
their shows in the leads and I'm just
something how is this even something we
can talk about everyone is beautiful but
basically this video
she won is doing a series called makeup
for the heart and she kind of came up
with this phrase and I just love it and
I think it's such a cool thing to kind
of live by and to think about so in this
video I'm gonna go through just a few
things that pop into my mind when I
think about what inspires me what
inspires me not just in general but to
be a better person especially and this
was almost hard to do and I had to
become more general because I thought I
feel like
there are so many things in my life that
inspired me to become better and my
gratitude journal has helped me so
that's kind of my number one my
gratitude journal is basically a journal
I keep where I write down every night
something that I'm thankful for now when
I first started it in January it was
kind of more general like I'm thankful
for my mom you know because blah blah
blah but now that I've gotten into you
know the 6th and 7th month it's getting
more specific like maybe something that
happened today that I'm very grateful to
happen or something someone said that
inspired me and so it's really cool the
way it's taken shape and that's
something you know you can do your
journal on your computer you can do it I
just bought a cheap notebook from Target
for like a dollar you can go to the
dollar store and just I keep it by my
bedside and so it just constantly
reminds me to just take you know 30
seconds to write one sentence down I'm
really bad about keeping a journal so
that's kind of my way of keeping a
journal of just gratitude of what I'm
grateful for so that's one thing that
really inspires me and if that's not
something you do I would definitely
recommend it because it's been very
helpful I have my list here
another thing is a good book and I
brought some out that I wanted to share
with you guys one is Eat Pray Love by
Elizabeth Gilbert and this was a big
deal you know quite a while ago it was a
best-seller then the movie came out but
this is a book that I give out all the
time I bought they were at half-price
books recently and I thought they were
like on clearance per dollar and I
bought a stack and I've given them out
to so many friends that are just kind of
add certain crossroads in their life or
maybe something's happening they just
need something to inspire them for them
to move forward and this is always what
I give them and I just love it I could
read it again and again now there's
certain parts of it that I don't love
and you know if you're under the age of
18 you know there's some I don't I don't
know what the age would be appropriate
but there are some risque parts but for
the most part it's just this wonderful
spiritual journey and I am a Christian
but and she goes through all these
different um you know she kind of
experiences some different religions and
different gods but what I love is the
message in it which is about it doesn't
matter what religion you are what you
believe but there's something greater
out there and it's called love and when
you find that
it's nothing can really topic it's
really hard to explain because she goes
through some really tough stuff in her
life so I really recommend it I promise
to read it like two days another one
that I'm about to start is called The
Happiness Project and you guys know I've
been on a declutter in pick and what
drew me to this was she says the
Happiness Project or why I spent a year
trying to sing in the morning clean my
closets fight write read Aristotle and
generally have more fun and it's by
Gretchen Rubin and I haven't started it
yet but I actually just finished a book
today this morning actually so I'm
really excited to give this one a go and
I just I think books can be so inspiring
and not only like I don't even want to
call these self-help books here's
they're really not but regardless
whether it's a self-help book or just a
wonderful novel novel or a nonfiction
book there's so much to gain from them
and my dad and I recently were having a
discussion and he was saying how he
doesn't really like to read fictional
books like novels and I was like oh my
gosh dad like there's so much to gain
from it he said I just feel like I'm
wasting my time because I'm just reading
a story but I'm not learning anything
and I was like hold on you learn a lot
from fiction whether you're an adult or
a kid or whatever and my main thing and
my sister and I talked about this too
which is that when you read you learn
about characters and see life from a
different perspective and every book you
read you're learning about a new
perspective and I think it just makes
you so much more open-minded and so much
more accepting and so much more capable
of understanding others and I think for
people that don't read a lot or maybe
just don't enjoy reading they're missing
something I think that they're just
missing that and maybe they're just
naturally more understandable but I
really do think it's made me a more
understanding person and also a more
curious person to learn about all these
different things in the world these
people in the world these cultures okay
this is a quote that has inspired me for
a long time because I used to really
suffer I don't really know of a better
word for it but I used to really suffer
from jealousy and I would be very
jealous and past boyfriends I've had I
was that jealous girlfriend where you
know I would because they worried about
who he's working with
you know what he's doing during the day
and who he's talking to online and who
he's texting and who but in the past and
it maybe it's because I'm in a wonderful
relationship now where it's just not a
worry of mine but a lot of books I've
read have helped namely Eat Pray Love
but also this quote and the quote is I
don't know it so I kind of reworded it
because I can't remember where I read it
but it was basically something like
you're not any prettier when you knock
someone else down or when you're jealous
of someone and you say something mean
about them it doesn't make you look any
better it doesn't make you more
beautiful it doesn't make you more
desirable to someone so basically I took
from that I don't need to sit there and
be jealous and think I used to do that
and I would find ways to make myself
feel better but it didn't make me any
more beautiful inside or out and that
was just one of those realizations the
more I thought about it year after year
the more I realized we women have to
empower each other and there's so much
power and that was something I really
struggled with I would see women not as
friends but as like enemies or like you
know it was very hard for me especially
as I was becoming an adult like I would
say the agents of high school all the
way through age probably like 21 or 22 I
made so many mistakes when it comes to
friends than when it comes to just so
many things and now I'm like I feel like
I see the light and that's basically it
we have to empower each other and love
each other because we're brothers and
sisters whether you're religious or not
we are and you know just as a human race
and I think that that has really
inspired me throughout so many moments
of my life so I'm really thankful for
having read that quote another thing
that inspires me is just nature and I
know that sounds silly but this is what
I had to pare down cuz I had so many
moments in my life but just I have to
force myself to put my phone down leave
it behind leave my iPad whatever and
just sit outside in silence and that was
another thing she talked about in Eat
Pray Love it's just in Italy they're
wonderful at enjoying the pleasure of
doing nothing and I think that in
America and probably other countries but
of course I'm American so I've got this
sheltered view of the world
I feel like we are not good at that and
we're constantly wanting to do something
and I know I I do that all the time I
can't just have it I can't even just sit
and watch TV I have to be doing
something else something productive and
I have to force myself to just take a
second and just breathe in what's going
on around you all the wonderful you know
it's a beautiful day out today and it's
it's a really cool day and I'd learned
to kind of appreciate the little nuances
and whether like I sat outside this
morning with my coffee and I thought wow
there's like this really cool breeze but
it's really sunny and even though it's
July it kind of feels like fall is
coming in and all those little nuances
in nature have just inspired me to just
take it all in and to slow down and if
and if you have to force yourself then
force yourself because over time it'll
become easier and you'll say okay I'm
gonna go spend some time just sitting
outside for a bit you know what are you
reading a book or just sitting there and
there's so much to take in
another thing that inspires me is travel
now my boyfriend and I love to travel
we're going to Mackinac Island soon and
so I went to the library and got all
kinds of books on it and that's
something we enjoyed doing planning for
the trip and mostly we're just nervous
that we'd like to learn about the
history of it but traveling just opens
again it just opens your mind you're
seeing things in a new way whether I'm
you know Michigan for me is only like
seven hours away the area we're going to
but you know we eventually are wanting
to travel a lot all over the place and
we know that's to come we're both just
trying to financially get stable before
we start doing things like that but we
know that's to come in our lives and we
know that's gonna be a big part of our
life and even just finding ways to kind
of turn your own city that you live in
into like a vacation place so everyone
so all will have a staycation where
we'll stay at a hotel we'll try and find
a good rate we'll stay at a hotel nearby
maybe downtown and find new things to do
that we wouldn't do otherwise on a
normal Saturday because there's so much
to do and when you go and visit a city
you look those things up and you find
all those things to do but when you live
in the city you don't really do that you
know what's in your bubble and you know
what you're used to but you don't really
branch out and do those other kind of
touristy things very often so we
to do that so we save money we get to
kind of travel without really traveling
and we end up discovering so many hidden
gems in our cities so it's just been a
really wonderful way to get us to go and
explore in our lives and just make it
more interesting and so we're constantly
learning and growing together
another thing that inspires me is this
idea that dr. Seuss why don't know if it
was his idea but it was in the book oh
the places you'll go and my mom just
recently got it for me for graduation I
love it and there's a part in it where
he's talking to the kid the author is
she's talking about this scary place
called the waiting place and it's where
all these people are around and they're
just waiting there waiting for a bus to
come they're waiting for vacation
they're waiting for the next holiday
they're waiting I mean we're just
waiting and it's so I have the
goosebumps just talking about it it's so
unbelievably true about us as a society
we wait and you know we're not ever
enjoying the moment that we're in we're
constantly waiting for the next good
thing that's happening so even if I'm
you know looking forward to tonight I
know that we're going out so I'm looking
forward to that so all this time in
between I'm just waiting I might be
doing and fiddling around and doing
things but we live so much of our life
just waiting and I think if we can turn
that on its head and start realizing
that every single moment this moment
right now every single moment is just as
important as that moment when you're on
vacation or when you're traveling or
whatever it is you're looking forward to
and that's something that's really hard
for me to train my brain to realize hey
when you're just sitting there checking
your Twitter you could be doing
something I mean this is your life and
not that there's anything wrong with
that I'm still gonna always check my
Twitter and you know but you don't have
to you know so much time I feel like I'm
wasting and I could be doing something
else I could be picking up a book I
could be walking around the neighborhood
walking my dog I mean there's just so
many things so I'm trying to be better
about this waiting game that we all play
and the last thing I'll talk about is
kids kids inspire me now I'm a teacher
and I'm a beginning teacher but I'm
surrounded by kids all the time all my
life I've had him like 15 nieces and
nephews or 12 I think and so ever since
I was like 5 I've had babies around
and kids and I just recently kind of had
the realization while I was watching
some of my nephew's play then I told
some of my family about this just that
kids live moment to moment they're not
ever really really truly planning for
what's gonna be what am I gonna be doing
this weekend or where will I be in five
years or how is this this job that I'm
doing gonna help me move forward or do I
need to get a different job or should I
go back to school or you know all these
things that cloud our mind that really
kind of have to cloud our mind because
you have to plan you've got it you know
but the spontaneity of a children's day
is unbelievable I was sitting there and
my nephew was just sitting next to me
and I was reading and he just had a toy
and he just can't kind of came in and
sat next to me and then he had his toy
he's going up he's just playing and then
he got up and went and played in the
corner of my room and I thought they're
just living moments a moment I mean he
just came in and didn't know had no
plans just stop there and just started
playing this toy and then moved over
there and played over there I mean it's
just so spontaneous and they just follow
where the rivers taking them and I
thought we need to take something from
that from kids now well we can't be that
spontaneous at least I couldn't be we
can certainly take something from it try
to be a little bit more like that just
see where the moments take you and I'm
realizing now after going through all my
inspiring things and that a lot of it
leads me towards reading more traveling
more and appreciating more and finding
ways to make sure those three things are
in my life is really important to me and
I realize all of those things the more I
do it the more better I am and all of
those things inspire me to become better
so I hope that this was a helpful video

was rambling at least it did to me but I
