channel 2 which is tyla travels TV it is
awesome a lot of our vlogs are on there
also just tons of travel stuff tons of
just fun stuff um so we were sent this
in its called what it man Jerry I keep
one works a pantry man pantry ma'am tree
manjeri like a spoonerism oh yeah they
have it a spoonerism is teacher oh yeah
it's where you blend like the firt
beginning award in the end of another
word right yep but then like it's like I
have a problem my brother got like a man
pantry would be a man tree which is what
this did photo and we were looking it up
because we are sent this and just for
consideration we could do whatever we
wanted with it we're like well why don't
we just film about it and then when we
looked it up we were like what because
it's literally yours are gonna believe
this we literally like no no what
seventy five dollars per month or per
crate whatever we were like what to know
that being said it is really really cool
so that's one new thing but I mean
that's insane look that's like a grocery
bill I that's like that's more than what
we spent on anniversary built in like
two weeks of course I don't even live
here yet but even so eat your a lot so
most every night hmm mr. so I mean
that's something but what i was thinking
like if father's day coming up it'd be a
really cool father to get immediately i
forgive for your spouse boyfriend
especially if they like to cook because
that's all idea that modern man's pantry
is like their slogan or whatever so
that's hideous and in which you see the
box that it comes in that alone is
really really cool so the box is a crate
and it is the coolest in look it even
says man sir I didn't even notice that
until just now family the man tree
company the modern man pantry man tree
com so I mean straight up yeah like it's
no joke wood in the lead visit so it's
really really cool and you get this
every month so I guess you really want
to
sure you how to use for cuz otherwise
like what's the point you know anyway
let's go ahead and dig it let's do it it
comes with like a letter from the
co-founder in college spring break is an
excuse to drive south until it gets warm
living in the Pacific Northwest this
meant a beeline to Southern California
where tacos are a roadside virtual I was
just in socal so saddle up the takeout
window bare feet burning on the asphalt
washed out some carnitas with icy
mexican coke before jumping back on the
101 okay there might not be a more
perfect fast food than the taco but it's
often over oh can we just all agree on
that tacos or burgers okay burgers are
fantastic mm-hmm you can't beat a
burrito or a taco man come home to 30
general are you kidding me oh I'm on
right now okay um but it's often
overlooked as the star of a dinner party
its interactive crowd pleasing and low
maintenance enough that as a host you
can actually enjoy yourself give it a go
invite some friends cracks and beers and
bring the taco in off the streets that
is awesome I do like that so I think
that's the theme right like I knew I
knew there'd be no Mexican food so
there's like a little thing oh this is
what they were talking about on the site
they said there's like recipes right and
that's cool too I assume they use what's
in the box yeah and also okay it's where
they're from that's what's really cool
and it's always American right isn't
that what we read it's always for
America so it kind of cells even like
here it tells where in America each
thing is from oh that's cool that is
really I'm awareness that's very cool
Wow yeah well this is good because this
is really all you so really why don't
you open it well we'll get over I mean
we'll enjoy together but still all right
let's see first things first right here
on top jalapeno real slice chips and sea
salt we're on trying right now are we
gonna try and RAM true dry right now
yeah we're going to transfer am I
getting up so I was getting to hiccup
some things have jalapeno see I love
spicy food I could
live off of only spicy food so let's get
it okay whole long where are these from
let's check it out oh yeah why do you
all like local places I mean everyone
here yet but are they like local places
like cardis made locally to the place
like they're smaller companies I would
as soon as that would be cooler this is
the jalapeno chips um I'm getting real
excited about the different things oh
here we go it's from Hardwick Vermont
cool whatever awesome it through a
little there's a little pickwick okay

your alley Oh your mother oh good oh no

is cool though literally all that's in
it cuz jalapenos vegetable oil corn
starch and sea salt that's all it's in
this that's cool don't know they're so
tasty but they're so hot so if you don't
likes but here's the thing I like spicy
food but there's a little bit my gosh
those are so good ah it's like burning
my ears it's a lot you guys okay yeah
I'd you guys ever had the like kettle
cooked jalapeno potatoes they're not as
hot is spicier but they have kind of a
similar tastes are you okay are you
dying I think I'm lactose intolerant
drink milk to wash this down but those
away in about of my face probably a
man's man food or anyone I shouldn't say
me at me because Franklin there tons of
women like that I just don't I know I
like the taste like your dad well spicy

right over these hills really is a great
gift for men or women who likes good

to get oh it's all these are so good hey
I'm all about this ok moving up we got
next here the best next thing is old dog
ranch Mexican hot chocolate walnuts
awesome how much you awkward moments
yeah I'll look at where it's from if you
will it's from balota or video that I
don't know California it's in Southern
California shot so i'm assuming maybe
it's pronounced him again with basic
ingredients I mean walnuts sugar cocoa
powder cinnamon and cayenne pepper oh
but i love i love okay so swimmingly so
far these first two they only use like
all natural ingredients i love that yeah
a lot of it seems that way and so these
you can insurance that they've been
doing for five decades nuts that's
awesome and they wrote they know they're
nuts funny on like 10 levels actually it
also says on the package here itself to
refrigerate after opening so unless Remy
be my refrigerator walnuts after she
opens up maybe that's a walnut thing or
may I don't know maybe she should i'm
not i'm not expert we should call it
that well they know they're not so so
what's next we got mexican hot chocolate
walnuts by old dog ranch if they're hot
and chocolate there any mexican i bet
they're spicy maybe but again see just
walnuts cacao powder cinnamon and
cayenne pepper it's so simple just like
a couple ingredients i wonder if that's
kind of a theme of this man trees that
there's just simple ingredients yeah
ready yeah we go mmm-hmm you can taste
the cinnamon is a man mm-hmm it's simple
it's not a very sweet chocolate but it's
a good job I mean it's just good yeah

California or balota I don't know and
that's all we've opened so far had the
guy who work who pickles a lot of
different things and every time he
brings them in there so good so I'm sure
these are gonna be absolutely delicious
that's right I mean too bad they really
are in the building the Millea colada by
the way is from Del Rio Texas yes
more things here habanero sauce what
whoa that's right up your handmade in
austin texas oh man yeah austin texas
yellow birch by nature immune from heat
and spicy peppers therefore they give
free rein over this abundant food source
interesting other animals tuck and run
mere whiff of heat the yellow bird is
reasonably dining in the comfort of the
pepper garden basking in the flavor of
the spice so this is yellow bird sauce
oh my gosh this sounds so good when I
just saying we need to get some hot
sauce yeah you were I'm excited I love
spicy foods and this sounds delicious
look I'd actually loves delicious looks
like a legitimate thing isn't lasting
last date so soon as equals so it really
is yeah I figure out something to use it
for sure that's so it'll be like a place
of it huh well actually maybe yeah just
could the dirt couldn't go to high
unless you covered the side maybe it was
a burlap in or something I don't see all
right mojo beef jerky let's try it was
the same garlic lime and cilantro we've
some fresh cilantro in our fridge right
now yes we do and some fresh limes oh
yeah we do what was the other thing
garlic we have a girl really close yeah
where's Tori precious you're like a
fresh princes and princess of Indiana a
bell anna belle era well back in bello
why not come so i am really bad at
opening packages I'm realizing today no
this one is bizarre I've been working on
the package for these three minutes hey
these childproof things are getting
ridiculous containing Ruiz drills out by
this what do they call that stress free
I got stressful packaging fullest
dresser that sometimes an option on
amazon com yes you get if you pay like a
dollar extra for stress-free packaging
it's like how stressed are people
getting do they not own scissors oh well
I gotta say I'm get pretty sure
right now trying to try some of this
jerky what's it three I don't care I'm
so good add my back oh my gosh this
smells like hello it's like coded it's
tough it's like look what out flimsy it
is it's not like that tough well gas
station beef jerky
oh yeah good this is the best beef jerky
I've ever had in my life handgun is
sweet but there's a little bit of savory
kick to it like spicy and some kind of
meat is it for her it should be okay
that's so Joe a mofo jerky whatever
lawrenceville georgia Alison Virginia
Georgia when it comes to Road eats while
a rare few gas stations are diamonds and
the oil so to speak so they're classic
mojo is beefy with the slight kick of
lime and cilantro good enough to nas is
but save a slice for your end of the
road drink to replace your bloody marys
gringo celery stalk with a touch of
Gaucho swagger swag goop this is great
that is really really good gosh the
smell as good as it is so that was
awesome so that was everything that was
in that box I think that was pretty
kwame okay be honest totally unbiased
cuz I know yes we should this free but
it doesn't really matter because if I
were to have like for real bought this
for you say like obviously you're not a
father but for fathers day gift or maybe
your birthday's in June like five bought
this for you for your birthday like
would you be like oh this is awesome or
would you I mean what do you think I'm
so channeled on this jerky I know so
though the jerky alone is like the bomb
oh so here's what I'll say I personally
love everything is in this box yeah I
love this all seems to be locally
sourced like small businesses I love
that everything that we had was so good
mm-hmm I don't think it's worth seventy
five dollars but I here i will say
everything in this box I would one
hundred percent by again like if I could
but if i could buy these jalapeno chips
or the walnuts or any of this at home
now the sauces gave a tried yet but you
know this will be good and it's I'm just
excited to try but I would be very
excited as a guy to get any of these
even if I just got needs I mean I would
be very excited we did find out that the
$75 is
it includes the ten dollars shipping
again even still 65 still some time but
but that is good to know yummy you know
and they all seem I mean all the
products are really good and they all
have very minimal and yeah and they have
minimal ingredients so I mean everything
seems to be like four or five
ingredients that are all natural there's
nothing that's like crazy that you know
yeah but I have to be a scientist to
know what they mean yeah so that's cool
too that it's all seems to be natural
stuff yeah so all in all I think it was
immediate was certainly fun to unbox
would we buy it ourselves maybe once I
mean maybe I saw but I do know it also
always comes with six full-size items
we're not you're going to get like small
things or it's always a linux just this
this will last us six seven months alone
yeah this one's a good point I mean
because you don't use a whole lot of it
so the sauces will last us a long time
so if you think about it kind of that
way spread it out over time that's a
really good point actually because we
would have bought a four or five dollar
house Oh easily yeah this 50 is probably
I mean we just actually just bought some
hot sauce and they were about four five
dollars but they were about four or five
dollars a piece so if you think I mean
now this is like a homemade one so it's
probably six or seven think about it
over the course of five things here
thank you that's your nike justify that
