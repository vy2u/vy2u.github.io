favourites and I actually have two kind
of fails this month so I feel like I
never mention things that I didn't like
cuz I don't know I'm a very positive
person but I know that it's beneficial
to also know the things I don't like so
I figured these two are ones that were
kind of glaringly products that I just
that just didn't work for me so I'm
gonna mention them as well so let's go
ahead and get started the first thing
want to talk about is this foundation
that I'm wearing today and it is the
Rimmel lasting finish 25 hour foundation
I'm wearing the shade 101 classic ivory
I'm wearing it today I actually have
filmed a lot of review demos today so
you'll see this outfit a few times and
this is one of the ones that I'm
reviewing so when it's up I'll put the
link below but this just gives such a
flawless satin finish that I think I
might wearing on my wedding day I was
talking about doing the Revlon Colorstay
whipped which I also love but this one I
think it's even better the only downside
is well it's a good thing it has SPF of
20 but for photos like for my wedding
that might flashback so I'm gonna have
to test it out with some flash
photography and see but this stuff is
amazing it's like six dollars another
favorite this month is my NYX HD
concealer I have it in the lightest
lightest shade it's in porcelain I think
yeah porcelain is what it's called I'm
wearing it today on one of my eyes the
other one I'm wearing a NARS one and I'm
putting up that video as well I'm not
gonna tell you which one is which I love
this stuff so much
it's like $4.99 it is amazing it does
not budge throughout the day and it
gives I think a really moisturized yet
flawless look I love it so much oh but
the video that I'm talking about is one
where I'm comparing this to the NARS
radiant creamy concealer so check that
out if you're curious if this is a dupe
for it or not I think you might have an
idea if it is or not another favorite
this month is the it cosmetics tightline
mascara now this was sent to me by a
cosmetics along with a lot of them but
it's one of the standout products to me
there were a lot of products that I
didn't love but this is one that I did
and it's got this tiny tiny brush with
it and the idea is that you kind of
tight line with it you just wiggle it
right at the base of your lashes to
black in that area
but also to separate your lashes and
lengthen them you're supposed to I used
this before applying my regular mascara
that I'm using that day I think this is
amazing this is the waterproof one and
it is amazing for your lower lashes
again probably another wedding day thing
that I'm gonna use because it's
waterproof so when I'm crying it won't
you know we all over my face another
favorite of mine is one from the Dollar
Tree and if you haven't seen my daughter
tree hauls what are you waiting on
everything's a dollar is amazing
I found this L'Oreal color riche laguage
there and it is in the shade pucker up
pink and it's just this really shimmery
sheer wash of color but there's
something about the flecks of shimmer in
this that makes your lips look so big
and healthy and juicy but not ridiculous
it's just the perfect balance I think
they still sell these in drugstores as
well for like the regular six or seven
dollar price but I found like every
single shade at the Dollar Tree and I'm
pretty sure I bought almost every single
shade but this is my favorite out of all
the ones that I bought I love it
speaking of lips one of the duds this
month is this cargo lip gloss now cargo
is an expensive brand this is in the
shade on Ghia ang UIL LA and giya I
don't know in upon first glance the
packaging is cute it's this light pink
color I was like oh I love that I think
I got this in some sort of subscription
box or something and when you swatch it
it even looks pretty it's this nice
light pink it kind of looks very opaque
when you apply it to your lips
it instantly clings on to anything dry
flaky but not but it's weird because
it's kind of a moisturizing formula or
at least you'd think but it clings on
and then it will not if anything is wet
it'll like stay away from it I mean like
it's like literally same sides of a
magnet they were just opposing each
other and so like the inside of your lip
like nothing will even go near it
I don't know how to describe it so it
was like crazy separated right away and
I kept like kind of going like that to
try and get it more inside and it was it
was ridiculous I don't know it was just
the weirdest thing and I'm so sad
because it's so pretty but I mean it was
terrible upon first applying it and
never got better I had to wipe it off
after an hour I'm like this is
unbelievable I've never experienced this
so stay away stay away my favorite nail
polish this month is actually the one
I'm wearing on my nails right now again
this might be the one I wear on my
wedding day and it's one of the Sally
Hansen miracle gel nail polishes and
it's in the shade creme de la creme and
it's just a really nice almost white
color I feel like these are really in
style right now everyone's kind of going
crazy over these almost white colors
like a pinkish white or a minty white or
a light blue white and I've been kind of
buying a few here and there but this is
the one that's kind of stood out to me I
really liked the formula it's you're
supposed to like this is step one and
then you're supposed to do a step two
like top coat of the same brand I use
whatever top coat I want sometimes it's
such feet sometimes it's another Sally
Hansen one I don't know that it matters
I might eventually buy it just to try it
because if it's if they really aren't
amazing together and they very well
maybe that would make it even better but
I just like this color and I have an
eyeshadow palette favorite and I just
did a demo I'm actually wearing this on
my eyes today it's the L'Oreal love
palette but specifically the palette
nude number one and it just got all of
these beautiful natural neutral shades
it's got a really nice mix of matte and
satiny shimmery ones they're not like
insanely buttery pigmented and if you
watch my video you'll see what I mean
but they're really I think blendable I
showed how I do this I look in that
video as well I really really was
impressed with this palette I thought it
was great if you've never bought a
palette before and you're looking for
where to start I think this is great but
even not just for starters I think it is
just a great palette the number two
palette which I also show in that video
I like but it's just not colors I wear a
lot so it just I haven't been using it
but this one I've been using every
single day for like two weeks now
lipstick favorite this is a rediscovered
one this is the Revlon Super Lustrous
lipstick in pink in the afternoon it's
just this really nice kind of darker
pink color I'm wearing this today and I
just think first of all the formula of
these are so on sorry I want more the
form of these are so unbelievable
they're so creamy and yet they stay on
they they never feel dry they wear off
evenly throughout the day I just
I forgot how amazing these are and I
only own two I own this one then that I
own one called primroses which is more
of a blueish baby pink and it's not as
wearable as I thought it was so I'm that
one I might be passing on soon I don't
know but pink in the afternoon is such a
beautiful neutral everyday color I love
it so much if you find it in stores pick
it up I feel like no one talks about the
shade and I loved it so much so two more
products the first one I'm going to
mention is one that I love and the last
one is gonna be another dud so I have
fallen in love with this NYC smooth skin
loose face powder I just have the
translucent one they have a couple other
shades I think these are like three
dollars at the drugstore and I I'm just
now getting into loose powders but I've
gotten I've got a couple really
expensive ones I've got some more
natural ones than I have this one and
this is the one I keep reaching for
because I only apply it my t-zone but I
think it does a nice job of mattifying
and setting my powder without looking
cakey I don't really know how it doesn't
now if you applied too much
it totally of course will look cakey but
I feel like it make it let's my skin
breathe but still makes it look just
that little bit more flawless I love
this so much I would suggest taking off
it comes with like a sifter on top and I
just kind of pried it off and threw it
away that way you can just dip your
brush right in tap it off because when
you're dealing with the sifter and
you're having to dump it out it just
ends up making more of a mess than
anything and I find that this is a lot
easier to deal with this way the last
thing I'm gonna mention I'm really sad
about because I just got it and I tried
it out and it like peeled off right away
this is the Milani color statement nail
polish and it's in the shade Dollface
and I put it on my toesies and it's the
prettiest pink and it was opaque it
applied well there was nothing weird
like that but I used my normal Revlon
Colorstay base coat that I love and I
use such feet on top I've been using
that combo for a year and a half two
years on both my toes and my nails have
never had an issue this stuff peeled off
like within a day it was the weirdest
thing and it reminded me of when I used
to apply like really cheap like kid
polished like that it was so weird I
might try it one more time just to see
and maybe I'll try it with a different
top coat I
or basecoat but maybe i'll try it
without a base coat sometimes regardless
I was really sad that is it more because
it was really opaque and it's a really
pretty pink color so I think I'll try it
one more time just to make sure it
wasn't just a weird coincidence but
that's I figured it was worth mentioning
I don't know if they're all this way but
that was my experience with it hopefully
this video was fun for you to watch if
