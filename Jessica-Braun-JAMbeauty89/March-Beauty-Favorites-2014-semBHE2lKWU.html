March favorites and let's just dive
right in one of my first favorites and
you're going to laugh because you're
going to be like Jessica why are you
starting with deodorant but let's think
how important is deodorant in your lives
very important right at least it is for
me and I've been on the hunt for natural
deodorants because you know there's so
many negative possible side effects in
the in your future when you use the
owner to have certain ingredients and
I'm aware of that and so I figure you
know it would be great to switch over
now and try and find one that I like if
I tried way too many and I finally found
one that I like it's the crystal body
deodorant roll-on and this is a liquid
and it's got a rollerball and it's one
of those kind like you have to let it
dry so i usually like right when i get
it to get out of the shower i'll put it
on that way it's got plenty of time to
dry while i'm doing my makeup hair etc
but it doesn't have a fragrance really
at all and it has no aluminum
chlorohydrate and really it's based on
mineral salts and so I don't know that
there's really anything bad in here I
mean I don't know that much about
deodorant let's be real but it actually
works odor protection why's it actually
works now it doesn't necessarily stop
the sweating but that's not really my
main concern my main concern is odor
protection very important there's
nothing worse than stinking so I was
really excited to find this like three
dollars i bought it at meijer but i'm
sure you can buy it online i really
really like it another favorite of mine
is a foundation and i just recently
hauled this and it's the covergirl
outlast stay fabulous three and one that
everyone's been talking about for like a
million years and I had it before and I
return to accept that I broke me out and
now I got it again cuz i was like maybe
it wasn't it and this stuff is amazing
oh my gosh it's like stupid good I it's
the perfect amount of coverage i would
say it's anywhere from medium to high
coverage it's just buildable but on its
own i would say it's medium coverage but
it's so nice and it wears like the when
you apply it in the morning it looks the
same
through the day and at the end of the
day it's just the only foundation I've
tried that actually looks the same it's
better than rub on colorstay hate to say
it but it is and that's been my favorite
for like two years now but I have
initiated 805 and which is ivory and I
just love it I love that as a pump it's
perfect now I like applying this with my
Real Techniques expert face brush and
this is just a smaller brush it's not
quite as dense as by Sigma ones that i
usually use but i just really like it
and there's something about it that when
i'm applying this foundation with it it
got dry areas right here and somehow
when i apply these using the brush it is
perfect it doesn't accent the dry areas
but when i use my sigma 1 somehow my dry
areas are star even with the same
foundation they just don't look as good
i don't know so I don't know what it is
about these two together but this brush
is amazing i love it I love it I love it
all right where to next hmm we'll talk
about this this is my shady lady from
the bomb palette and this it's their
volume one they have three or four
different volumes I've showed this a
million times it has the coolest range
of colors and what's so crazy is you
guys know me I'm usually all about the
natural I or neutral I i should say but
these colors are everything to me these
three here at the bottom are my
favorites there's this yellowish one
that is just so beautiful on the lid and
then the green i didn't get a good
swatch of that the green and the blue
here are beautiful crease or outer color
corners what outer corner colors and
what i love about them so much is that
they are so blendable there's so
pigments and yet when you want to blend
together you can get the most beautiful
looks with these i love this palette and
i think i think this is my favorite
eyeshadow palette over the naked i know
that it is I view that I found it for
two years and I still reach for it all
the time so go figure you can get it on
hautelook for like twenty bucks it's
usually 40 but when when the bomb is on
there they usually have these and you
can get it for like twenty dollars and
that's what I bought it and I love it ok
there's so many things to talk about so
exciting alright so one
thing that I have just recently
rediscovered and this is so exciting to
me because I've had it all along and I
had no idea how good it was do you have
anything like that in your lives were
you you've had something for a while it
might not even be makeup it could be
closed or I don't even know and you had
no idea that it was so good and then
you're like what what why have I had
this so long and never known how great
it was this is the hard candy glama
flage concealer and they only have it in
a couple of shades I think my walmart
they have three maybe four but I bought
this a long time ago it comes with a
little concealer stick that I don't
really use like a pencil but this which
I have in the shade light which i think
is the lightest they have is the most
high coverage concealer ever and what
blows my mind about it is that not only
does it conceal anything you got going
on but it actually stays put all day it
does not budge I personally with my skin
have never noticed any creasing now I
also set it with a powder i usually use
like well i'll show you what i use here
in a second but i always said it with a
finely milled powder just in case so i
don't know how it wears on its own but
this stuff is amazing I and here's the
kicker here's how i know i love this i
recently bought the mac pro longwear
concealer and once i rediscovered this I
reach for this every single day over the
mac one and i love that mac one and it's
a new purchase so it's exciting but
still reach for this puppy it's it's
amazing and the kicker's I didn't wear
today and I mean it's fine but I noticed
the difference i was out and about today
and i wore the Rimmel wake me up
concealer because I had to use it I was
like I need to get some use out of this
and see how i like it so i use it and
it's okay and it's nice and i think it
has a nice brightening but it doesn't
have as much coverage so i looked in my
rearview mirror and I was like wow I
notice a big difference between what I
wear that and when I wear this this
stuff is awesome awesome awesome awesome
okay so what I usually sent that with
lately has been this elf mineral
foundation now this is supposed to be
for all over your face and I've had a
lot of breakouts up here recently and I
think it's because of another product
i'm going to mention but I've had some
breakouts and i put on my foundation and
it covered it pretty well but i was like
i need a little something
little bit red but I didn't want a coke
concealer all over it and sometimes you
know that makes it look worse so I
thought I wonder if this would work this
was perfect I sweep tit all over up
there and it just covered the redness
but didn't highlight that area or
anything was perfect so really impressed
with the coverage of this powder and
then on top of that it's just a really
nice brightening powder for under your
eyes so that's how i've been using it a
lot lately and I haven't the shade
porcelain which I'm sure is the lightest
one I did have it in light which is one
shade up and it was a little too dark
for me so I really like porcelain and it
really does a nice job of highlighting
and covering that area and setting your
concealer it's a win-win situation there
so I think this is five or six dollars
on elfs website and you know they always
have deals galore over there okay so I
love all of these things here the next
thing I want to talk about is the pixie
flawless beauty primer now this I got in
either an Ipsy or boxy charm and it is
it really it illuminates your face it is
a prior you can kind of see how
iridescent it is can you see the
iridescent of it yeah there it is it's
just so it almost the first time I did I
was like it's a little darker than my
skin tone it's all shiny I was like this
is gonna be terrible man i hate it i
fell in love with this and i never liked
products like this ever but i also just
have combo skin so i'm not super oily i
think if your oily might not love it but
you might even still because it provides
just the right amount of iridescent but
it doesn't look sherry it doesn't look
weird you know I was like sometimes it's
like way too much it's beautiful under
foundation I haven't tried mixing it yet
but I bet that would be beautiful too
but i really like it under however i
think this is why i was breaking out up
here so i really just kind of stopped
putting it up there and I've just been
leaving it you know like here and it's
been fine so who knows it's clearing up
and i'm still using it so i don't i just
don't know but i really really like this
stuff like a lot and i keep noticing
i've been loving pixie products i don't
think i've ever received a pixie product
that i didn't end up loving in the end
that pixie bronzer i love to you guys
know so go figure another product that i
was so shocked that i liked sorry
if I keep looking over here it's cuz my
lap I've tried filming this video and it
kept being out of focus just in like the
whole video I was just out of focus so
I'm trying to keep double trekking luck
okay I'm good right I'm good right I'm
good I'm good right okay the Ulta blush
that subscriber send it to me you guys
know about and and buy you guys know
about I mean I showed it in a video and
I'm still just floored because that was
so sweet of her and it's in the shade
girly and it really reminds me of Mac
Melba it's just a really simple very
matte peach color Wow look at that the
pigmentation is out of this world it's
not powdery it's look it's amazing and
the thing that kills me is that you know
altos always having those sales where
it's like by to ulta products get 50,000
of them free you know ridiculous sales
for alta brand and i always overlook
them cuz i'm like a like a i have enough
makeup but also i'm just like i've never
really hear that much about their brand
and I don't know you know I'm sure that
some of them are good but I've always
just skipped over it this makes me not
want to skip over it as much because
this is amazing and the packaging is
nice and simple and sleek and the
pigmentation is amazing and on top of
that when I wore it the few days I've
worn it so far it stays on all day it
looks the same as when I put it on in
the morning by midnight I mean it's
amazing so two thumbs up ulta and thank
you for sending this to me you are so
sweet not Alta you know who you are you
know what I'm saying what am I talking
about I don't know okay so another
favorite of mine is this moisturizer for
your face and it's the avalon Organics
vitamin c renewal cream and it's a
really really thick cream um smells good
it's smells so good it smells like
oranges it's a it runs from anywhere I
think depending on where you get it
twelve to seventeen dollars depending on
where you get they sell an admirer near
me but the I bought it on vitacost calm
which I'll link below you can always get
like ten dollar off coupons and these
are kinds of things you can get from
them but I ended up getting it on a good
deal and it's just really nice it's
thick and moisturizing but it doesn't
when I put it on in the morning before I
put on makeup it doesn't make my skin
look greasy you know some moisturizer do
so it's safe to use morning
and night which I love it's SuperDuper
moisturizing and it's just been really
nice this winter especially this past
month is the weather keeps switching
back and forth it'll be really really
cold one day and then today it's 65
tomorrow I'm sure it'll be like 30 30 of
course that's the day i'm filming this
who knows when i actually upload it but
regardless it's been a lifesaver i love
it i love the smell and i love the way
it looks on my skin so million thumbs up
for that one another favorite i finally
caved and bought one of the Maybelline
the new products and their master
highlight blush and I got it in the
shade pink rose and it's just this
mosaic looking you know powder and it's
this really pretty you know I'm gonna
swatch on differently because that's the
one I had the other one on there we go
it's this really pretty pink and there's
a swatch of it right there it's a
beautiful color and not only is it a
beautiful color but it has this nice
iridescent to it that I think is just it
ends up looking so flawless when you use
a brush I love to apply this with my
stippling brush from ELF just because it
adds like the right amount of all of
those colors you know and it's just
beautiful and again the where time on
this is so impressive it stays on
virtually all day i keep looking i
didn't i'm not wearing either one of
these today i'm a bozo I should have
worn one of them but I just love this
blush I was so pleasantly surprised i
would say that i'm tempted to try the
other colors but i'm really not just
because i have so many blushes but
really if you're looking for a new blush
look at this line i really like this
shade but if you're not in a pink they
had a bunch of they had bronzy colors
and all kinds of different ones so i
loved that so another favorite of mine
and this is an oldie but a goodie is the
palladio curls rule mascara gosh i tried
this out last year when Pilate have sent
me a bunch of products and i fell in
love with it and i remember talking
about a lot last year and then I kind of
stopped and then I was trying this again
and I remembered why I love it the brush
is small and simple I mean there's
really nothing special about the brush
at all in the packaging is nothing to
write home about either you know but the
there's something about this formula
your curl on your lashes will
a all day my lashes have never looked as
good as they do right now of course it's
I applied this a million years ago I'm
full of hyperbole today hold on hello hi
handsome also i'm filming a video right
now i think i might not edit this out I
don't know that they're gonna respond
they might they might be responding to
you at home but you won't be able hear
them why mamas okay I'll see you soon
handsome you still want to go on a run
yeah okay love you too bye so sorry okay
anyway so this mascara I just really
really love it it holds your curl all
day I've never had a mascara that worked
this well and it's super super black I
love it the only thing is it gets a
little bit of clump like super duper
clumpy depending on when you apply I
mean it's one of those really fickle
mascaras so the mmm covergirl clump
crusher I'll usually use to brush
through clumps if I need to some
mornings I don't need to but it's just
volume black and curled I mean it's
crazy this mascaras like I don't even
know it's amazing so the last thing I'm
gonna mentioned for a favorite is this
cover chrome novel said mascara lipstick
and it's one of their perfection I don't
know what they're called but it's in the
shade eternal I might have already
talked about this in a video but i love
this lipstick so much that's it right
there it's just the most beautiful
bluish red wine berry color I mean I
don't even almost don't even describe it
it's so beautiful i love the way it
wears and it doesn't have like an
offensive smell right now i'm wearing a
l'oreal one it's from that new line and
it's the free does nude if you know what
I'm talking about but anyway and that
one had the smell of it gives me a
headache in fact I have a headache right
now but these don't have an offensive
smell and I just think it's the
prettiest color packaging is cute too
super sleek like a bullet anyway so
those are all of my March favorites
hopefully that was helpful I'll have
links for you know some of the things
down below but I hope that was helpful
for you guys let me know what some of
your March favorites were and I'll catch
you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
