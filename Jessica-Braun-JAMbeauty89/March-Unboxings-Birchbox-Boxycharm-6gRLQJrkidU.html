an unboxing of my boxy charm and my
Birchbox let's start with the boxy charm
this one is $21 a month so it is a
little bit pricier alright so it's
creepy cute is the theme apparently well
what okay
I haven't opened this yet oh it's a
smaller size so first thing in here
holy moly is the Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer now I have the full
size of this one I got it on HauteLook
it was like 50% off but says this primer
is the first primer that was ever
created at Smashbox photo studios LA it
blurs fine lines and pores leaving skin
with a velvety smooth even finish I do
agree I love this primary used to be my
favorite back when I live with my
parents and I was first starting my
channel and I had like a tiny size so
this is like a deluxe deluxe prime I
mean this will last you a while but that
is amazing this is a fantastic primer
Wow next thing in here is this real her
lady love matte liquid lipstick I've had
something else from real her I think I
got it like in my fabfitfun for spring
set the brands that it was but let's see
what it says it says the retail price is
$15 and it said the retail price for
this was 16 I don't know if I don't
think that's what the full-size I think
that would be for that size so it's in
the shade I am a rock star and says it's
a lightweight formula oh it is the same
brand that came in the other ones so ooh
ooh very like a deeper marsala color
very whiny it is very lightweight and
smooth so I'm excited to give that a try
and this is definitely a full-sized the
packaging feels it very nice next
product is this real her lip liner this
one retails for 1250 and it's called I
am loved I wonder if it would go well
with this it looks like it would and
that would be awesome I like that
they're kind of creating combos with
their products you can actually use them
together oh yeah oh my gosh that is so
creamy this color is totally up my alley
and again this is full-size that is like
the perfect fall duo period and these
feel so high-quality
so future Jessie here I tried this out
just the other day and it was so drying
and looked horrible on my lips and it
really did darken to a much darker color
just FYI this is a brush and it's the
its crown brush the SS 0 to 3 deluxe fan
brush oh it is deluxe it is so soft it's
much thicker it's not like like I've got
my thin fan brushes I'll use for like
highlighter this is much thicker so I've
used fan brushes for like bronzer you
could use it for highlighted just be a
lot punchier you know this one is so
soft though and it's funny because I
don't own one like this and I was
thinking about buying one recently now I
don't have to that is awesome
so the last thing oh and that retails
for 1899 crown brush is also on
HauteLook a lot you can get a lot of
their brushes and brush sets and stuff
are really cheap last thing in this box
is from Naked cosmetics it's their urban
rustic palette and it retails for $40 so
it's pretty small for a $40 palette I
have to open these like a freaking
savage because they won't it won't open
I get freaking frustrated don't you guys
like I'm so impatient oh yeah it's just
thank you so here it is okay these are
beautiful colors but why is this $40 for
three shades like this is and there wow
I mean they're crazy pigmented crazy
beautiful
but $40 I mean they're gorgeous $40 you
can almost buy like a two-faced palette
for that like $10 warm you guys get the
idea it's pretty
I mean it's these colors are beautiful
but just seems like I mean am I crazy
are you guys like nodding your head in
agreement that seems very expensive it's
not to say that the quality is not there
and then it's not deserving of that but
for a brand that I've never heard of and
I know I'm sure some of you guys have
but for three shadows
that is wild that is while I wouldn't
pay that for like brands I have heard of
that are really good so regardless it
was not $40 when it comes in this box so
that is pretty awesome moving on to the
birch box the theme is Oh Reese
Witherspoon is the person behind this
this time around she said in honor of
Women's History Month Traber James which
is her southern inspired lifestyle brand
and I have teamed up with Birchbox to
bring you a box for calling pretty
mighty it may look Danny but inside
you'll find powerful high-performing
products for equally powerful women just
like you all right so the first thing in
here ooh is from Kiehl's
it's their ultra facial cream I know
people loved heels I've tried a couple
other products I really liked them but
I'm excited to give this a try
and again it's travel size so if it's
really good I can throw this in my
carry-on
I love next thing in here is this
benefit they're real mascara I tried the
full size of this and it was okay I know
some people it's their Holy Grail the
wand is kind of odd but people love it I
didn't love it so I'm probably gonna
pass this on to a friend or a sister
that I know would genuinely use it so
it's not just sitting in my collection
next thing ooh is from Amica who tried
some of their hair stuff and it's really
good this is their perkupp dry shampoo
sea buckthorn berry yeah I can't really
smell but anyway love having dry shampoo
and the Amika products I've tried were
very good next thing is this real
chemistry fresh start foaming cleanser I
forgot their prices so the keels that
was 2754 like the full-size the benefit
they're real full-size is $24 the Amika
full-size is $24 this cleanser the
full-size is $24
I really do like foaming cleansers I
just don't end up buying them very often
and this next one is from Coastal Scents
it's one of those tiny eyeshadow things
then it's like can we just have a
different product please but and their
shadows aren't bad and these are two
pretty colors it's from
no that was not great this like
greenish-gray is not great yeah the
champagne color was good the other one
was horrible so but nothing against
Coastal Scents but I don't know like I
would rather if essentially these
products I'm paying $2 apiece for
because if it's $10 and you get five
products you're essentially paying $2
apiece
I would pay $2 at ease for most of these
I would not pay $2 for this and so I
think that's why I get so upset about it
I'm like what so anyway I hope this was
enjoyable if you love subscription box
unboxings I will link my playlist below
so you can catch more of them and
otherwise I hope you'll subscribe and
say hi on my social media and I'll see
you guys in my next one
