top favorite most loved Mary Kay
products I have been so lucky to have
many subscribers send me all kinds of
goodies over the years but especially
Mary Kay makeup products and this is
something that I feel like I tried a lot
of them and some of them I have ended up
passing on if you've seen some of my
declutter videos I ended up getting rid
of a couple Mary Kay things and passing
them on to sisters and my mom and things
like that um but there are some haricots
products that I love and I that I really
feel like are really high-quality
they're worth the money because really
Mary Kay is kind of expensive as I
looked these things up online and was
writing down the prices for this video I
was like gosh like some of these are
just as expensive as things you'd get it
altars for but I thought about and
realized you know they really are really
good quality so in the end it's worth it
it's just I feel like so many people
think of Mary Kay and they think of you
know the Mary Kay parties and maybe
people they're a little bit older and I
wouldn't say that I'm old and I love
Mary Kay so I'm excited
I have blabbered on enough let's go
ahead and get into my favorites so one
of the things that I have fallen in love
with are the Mary Kay eyeshadows and I
have six of them now this is in one of
their compacts this is called their mini
compact and it is $17 they have a bigger
one which is 19 where there's like a
spot for your lipstick and then you open
it and there's places you can put things
but I to me this is a little bit big for
what I'm using it for so this one is a
lot more sensible to me however you know
if you do know you want the extra space
then $2 more is nothing for a lot more
space however I like the smaller one
better these are just magnetic and you
can fit the eyeshadows there blush which
I'm going to talk about one in a second
they're all magnetic and they fit in
these things so I think that's pretty
cool if you travel a lot or you really
if you find things that you like and you
know you can put your blush you like
three eyeshadows you like and you're
good to go
so these are the six that I've been
using and really really liking this
includes in the top left corner
silky caramel hazelnut is in the top
middle and then driftwood is at the top
right
and then there's rose gold on the bottom
left in the bottom middle
amber blaze and then French Roast in the
bottom right now I use all of these
eyeshadows for my look today I used rose
gold right all over my lid and then I
also you really I used all of them I
used silky caramel to blend everything
together
I used French Roast on the outer corner
there and I use what was this one called
hazelnut kind of all over the crease
kind of as a buffer color they're all
absolutely beautiful the only one when I
looked online for these that I couldn't
find with silky caramel which is this
matte kind of light peach shade that's
not really one that I love anyway so you
know out of all them that's my least
favorite and they I don't think they
sell anymore but the rest of them are
still available these all retail for
seven dollars apiece the shimmery ones
are really really pretty
this is French Roast this is amber blaze
and that is rose gold but you'll notice
that French Rose has a lot of kind of
Fallout and I noticed that on my face
today
amber blaze is pretty but it skips a
little bit so you have to be careful
applying it in my favorite favorite is
the rose gold one which is just really
pretty rose gold color
now the next three are the kind of matte
shades and these are um good but like I
said the UM trying to make sure I've got
a good swatch of all these for you guys
they I think I like the matte ones
better than the shimmery like if you
look at these two
this one was driftwood and that's
hazelnut and then that is Sookie caramel
the one that I don't think they sell
anymore I really really really like
hazelnut that one I end up using a lot
but they're both really pretty and silky
for a matte shadow I really like them
the other thing to keep in mind though
is that you know it's seven dollars a
pop I think that's kind of expensive of
course you can get single shadows from
the drugstore that are almost that price
but you're usually not buying a bunch at
a time if you do the math seven times
six that's 42 dollars just on the
shadows long without buying the compact
you could buy the Naked palette with
that you could buy the lorac Pro which i
think is amazing or the chocolate bar
palette so keeping that in mind
if I were to pick just three that I love
so maybe you weren't spending as much I
would pick the rose gold shade that I
used all over my lid hazelnut there in
the center that's that matte color I
like in the crease and then I would also
pick French Roast
even though there's a little bit of
fallout it's really really nice I use it
on my lower lash line today and I just
like it of course I wish there weren't
as much fallout but those are my three
favorites for my skin tone
now the next product I'm going to talk
about is their blush now this is in the
shade shy and this color is just a
really pretty kind of natural peachy
pink shade with a lot of gold shimmer
this retails for twelve dollars which is
pretty pricey when there are tons of
drugstore blushes that are really really
good but it's really really nice I'm
wearing it today it stays on all day it
doesn't budge I think it looks nice with
a fair skin tone which is kind of hard
to find in a peachy blush I think but I
also think it would look beautiful and
kind of frosty on a deeper skin tone so
I feel like it's really universal and
just pretty and natural you can get
heavy-handed because it is so beautiful
and pigmented you know you got to be
careful with it the first time around
but it's not as crazy as like the elf
blushes which are really really good but
if it's a bright color you have to like
be light-handed with it at first I think
this one's kind of right in between I
really like it
and again these fit in the compacts
because they're magnetic so that's
another plus there so if I were to redo
my small mini compact I would pick these
three as my three favorite shadows from
the line this is rose gold hazelnut and
French Roast
and then I would also use this blush
which is shy and so I just wanted to
show you what it would look like if you
did end up taking some shadows out and
putting a blush in the small compact as
well the next thing I'm going to talk
about are their cream eye colors and I
have had a few of these over the years
and if you watch my declutter like I
mentioned I did get rid of a few of
these what I've noticed is that across
the board all the four or five that I've
tried the formulas were the same the
consistency so there's nothing weird
like that you know with some makeup
lines they'll have some colors that are
amazing and then others that aren't the
same formula for whatever reason it
don't work
well they all seem to work just as well
as the next one they were great these
are $14 in the two that I kept for beach
blonde and metallic tote now beach
blonde is this really pretty almost like
a rose gold champagne color it's kind of
like a perfect mix I really like it
because it does have that beautiful
shimmery quality but it does blend out
to be a little more sheer let me just
show you and once you've kind of sheared
it out it's still a shimmery but it's
not quite as bold as it had originally
swatched I wore this today under my eye
look just all over my lid and this is
beautiful just on its own like for a
quick wash of color and like I said it
really does shear out when you're
applying it so if you're looking for
something to be just like that exact
color of the swatch you're going to have
to layer it on quite a few times the
next one I got was metallic taupe or the
next one that I love and this is more of
a like purplish gray brownish kind of
color and it is metallic as the name
would imply and it's a really really
pretty pretty color this one I tend to
use on my lid as well and I didn't use
it today because I wasn't necessarily
using both um but it looks really really
nice on its own as well but again it
does shear out just a little bit not as
much as the other but it still has its
own color but I do think with this one
it looks really really pretty when you
put like a kind of a frosty champagne
white color on top of it it looks really
cool and kind of dimensional one of my
favorite ways to use it but the formula
of these is amazing because it does not
budge all day like if I had to wipe
those swatches off right away because if
I left it on it would be there all day
in fact I missed a part of it and it's
not going to come off yeah it's really
difficult to come off just like with the
baby white but with makeup remover it's
fine I mean I've never had issues even
with cleansing oil it comes off but it's
not going to wipe away just like that
it's really which I like in a cream
shadow I don't want it to move these
don't crease they are $14 though which i
think is really pricey when you can get
the Maybelline Color tattoos for you
know seven or eight bucks depending on
where you get it and those are really
really good too but I do like them and
they are cheaper than like the Mac Paint
Pot so
the last thing I'm going to talk about
from Mary Kay is their setting spray
now this retails for $18 and it's only
two fluid ounces but it's made by
Scandinavia which is also the company
that makes urban decay setting spray and
they also of course make their own
setting sprays this is amazing I use it
today and what I like about it is that
it doesn't it'll it'll force my makeup
to stay put all day it really does work
but it doesn't make my face greasy when
I first spray it on because with like
the L'Oreal infallible spray that's like
$14 which is a three or four dollars
cheaper than this which is great except
for it does make my face a little bit
greasy and I feel like once I spray it
I'm like great my makeups gonna stay in
place but I look all greasy so then I
have to put like some mattifying powder
on top of it and then I'm like I feel
like this is defeating the purpose so
even though that's amazing too this one
I think I do like better because it
doesn't make my skin look greasy it's so
perfect and what is amazing is that the
sprayer looks like a normal sprayer but
in a setting spray you want to make sure
that the spray nozzle isn't going to get
clogged up that it's not going to give
you a you know patchy application you
want it to spray a fine mist everywhere
and this I've had for like a year now
it's about halfway gone and it has still
you know using it this morning
it still sprays a very fine mist
everywhere there's no super wet patches
and then some dry patches it's still so
fine which is awesome awesome awesome so
I know that wasn't a ton of Mary Kay
products but out of all that I've tried
even some of their lip products I found
some things that were okay but these are
the ones that I kept reaching for that I
felt strongly enough about them to share
them with you let me know what some of
your Mary Kay favourites are down below
