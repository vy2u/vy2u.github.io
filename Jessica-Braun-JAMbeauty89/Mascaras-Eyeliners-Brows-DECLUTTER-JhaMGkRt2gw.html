products I kind of put these together
because I have a good amount of both but
I didn't think they needed to be in
their own separate video so I'm gonna go
ahead and organize these and then we
will start going through them one by one
now let's start with the mascaras first
so some of these are like already ready
to just go because they're getting older
this is the revlon ultimate all-in-one
mascara has a really tiny brush i
actually really liked this it's not too
old yet so i might hold on to this but i
guess the reality is i haven't been so
impressed that i've wanted to keep using
it so maybe it's i think i'm just gonna
get rid of it
this i know i'm gonna get rid of it's
the covergirl fibers I just didn't like
it as much as I liked the regular one
which now I'm seeing it's not over here
but I have the regular one of this and I
love it it's just the covergirl super
sizer it's incredible it's got the same
brush I think yeah but it doesn't have
apparently fibers in it and I feel like
that one works way better so I'm gonna
get rid of this one even though I've
only used it a couple times this is the
Lancome de finished seals right
definicils and it was nice but again I
didn't feel like it was like
groundbreaking life-changing especially
for the price so that was really
disappointing I don't think it's bad by
any means but I don't think it's
necessarily worth almost twenty dollars
for mascara because we all know they go
bad at just the same rate whether it's
high-end or drugstore so I think I'm
gonna get rid of that one as well this
is the benefit they're real mascara I
actually really like this but I've had
it for a little bit too long so it's
just time for this one to move on this
one I haven't even opened but to be
honest with you I have they're both from
boots number seven this is the state
perfect mascara this is the maximum
volume I hated the state perfect mascara
so much so I'm definitely getting rid of
it
it makes me second-guess whether I
should even open this one it's literally
still sealed because I don't want to
waste yet another mascara because I
don't like it so I'd rather almost have
like a sister or someone have this while
it's brand-new and get to try it out
versus me opening it hating it and
throwing it away you know what I mean so
I think I'm gonna pass this on now while
it's still new this is the YSL what is
it's like their vinyl Couture mascara
and it's in like the blue shade I
haven't tried it yet I think I am gonna
keep it to it
try it just cuz it's totally different
and totally not typically up my alley so
I'm gonna keep it just to at least try
it let me kind of do these in so you can
see up there we go this is the SA edit
up and out double mascara I haven't even
opened this yet I don't want to open it
yet just because I want it to be fresh
but I am going to keep it to actually
use it this is the blink jet-black
Volume Mascara again it's brand new I
don't really have a desire to try it and
I've got plenty of mascaras I'm gonna
pass it on this is one of my favorites
the Lancome Hypnose mascara but it's
just a little bit old so I'm gonna pass
it on this is the benefit they're real
tinted primer this I actually like I
think it's pretty good so I'm gonna keep
that now all the rest of these are brand
new so I'm only gonna keep the things I
know I have a desire to try the rest I'm
gonna pass on so I don't open them this
is the pur cosmetics fully charged
mascara it's talking about magnetic
technology honestly I'm kind of
interested to try it so I think I'm
gonna keep this so these are my like
brand new unopened ones right here this
is the it cosmetics tightline mascara I
love this stuff it is amazing I have two
of them but there's a full-size in the
small I don't think I'll keep both just
because I figure I'll spread the love
but it's an amazing really tiny brush
one it's amazing for bottom lashes but
it's also really good for just kind of
literally tight lining your area where
you typically put liner so I'm gonna
keep the full size pass on the smaller
size this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory I want to
see what the actual one looks like soap
&amp;amp; Glory mascara they're thick and fast
high definition collagen coat mascara I
kind of want to keep this to just to try
it it says it's got collagen again it's
something I've never I don't think I've
tried no mascara it's there seven sided
fan flare 180 brush so I'm just kind of
interested so another one I want to try
this is the better than sex waterproof
and I am gonna try this
I like the better than sex regular
mascara pretty well it's not my favorite
but it's still pretty good so I'm
interested in that one this is the it
superhero mascara I'm just gonna pass it
on
don't really have a a dying need to try
it same with this is it Sephora brand
mascara I don't really I'm just not
interested this I just recently bought
so I am gonna try this
it's the l'oreal primer mascara i've
heard kind of mix things so i'm excited
to try that on my own so the only thing
i'm not showing here
right now is the one I'm currently using
that's the super sizer it's just in on
my vanity I'm sure but yeah so these are
the only things I'm keeping this is what
I'm getting rid of 1 2 3 4 5 of them are
open ones that are just ready to go and
one two three four five six of them are
brand new I'm gonna pass on not bad I
think that's pretty good and these I
want to go slowly with them and really
try one at a time because obviously I
hate that I'm getting rid of five all at
the same time that just makes me sick to
my stomach so and then this is an open
primer and then this is kind of a weird
one I'm going to be trying so I think
that's pretty good let's move on to the
brows
okay so here we go let's these two tools
I use every day my tweezers and then
these scissors I mean those are
literally going nowhere so I'm
definitely keeping those here all my
brow gels
I love the Anasazi one I just bought a
new one and now I need to figure out
which this is the new one it's just a
clear brow gel it holds everything
perfectly I think I'm literally going to
get rid of all of these this is the
number seven one it was really good but
it's just old this is my old Anasazi one
this is by Tanja crooks it's the brow
gal it's really bad it made my eyebrows
literally like have flakes all around
them where it had dried and it says its
water-resistant and I'm sure that's true
but it also leaves crap all around on
the skin around your eyebrows it's so
gross
one of the worst products I've ever
tried this is by chela and I haven't
even opened it and I've tried this
before and I liked it but I didn't love
it as much as this so I still think it's
a good product but again while it's
unopened I'm gonna pass it on so I'm
literally only gonna keep one brow gel I
think that's pretty awesome
get rid of the other four here all my
brow pencils now right off the bat I
know I'm keeping these two these are the
two I use all the time this one's by
Anasazi it's their brow definer in
medium brown but as a spoolie on one end
and it's got a triangular tip on the
other and I love that this is what made
me love triangular tipped brushes it's
the hourglass arch brow pencil and ash
and again it's got the exact same shape
and I love this and it has a spoolie so
these are kind of my two like true blue
brow things honestly I feel like I
should just get rid of all the rest
because I know I love these so much the
only thing that stops me is these are
too drugstore options that I think are
really amazing this is an elf one that
I've had and I like having drugstore
options to share with you guys because
they really are incredible and I could
use this interchangeably with any of
these and it'd be still just as amazing
but I just have spent the money on these
and I just love the shape of the pencil
I know it sounds dumb but it really
makes a difference when you're applying
it this one's amazing as well it's by
Maybelline it's their brow satin and
they also call it their define and fill
and it's got the
pencil on one side but then it has what
I love on this side this kind of powder
that you can apply and it's on a sponge
and I think that's just so amazing so
maybe I'll keep this one since it's so
different
pass on the elf one these okay this is a
I hate it and I know some people really
like it it's the Maybelline brow drama
crayon but it's just the wrong shade for
me but it's also just humongous and as
the point becomes more and more dull I
don't know how people would continue to
use this it'd be too big for most
people's eyebrows at least for mine so
for me I don't get this product so it is
definitely going I have to at cosmetics
brow powers it's similar where it's got
the pencil but the idea is that it can
go light to dark okay it's actually
pretty dry now that I'm seeing that but
I just didn't love this so this one's
brand new this one's barely used I'm
gonna pass those on as well the only
thing I'm left with are these anastacio
brow whizzes and I think I don't need
both they're both the exact same shade I
think I'll get rid of one and keep the
other the reason I want to keep one is
cuz if I ever ran out this is still the
perfect shade and I still really like it
but the difference is I love the spoolie
on the brow is because it's a lot
thinner and it's so it's it's just
amazing let me see which one has more
I'm gonna keep the one that has more
well I'll keep one get rid of the other
all right these honestly these are like
highlighting type pencils the Sonia
Kashuk one when I first used it it you
don't necessarily I mean you can use it
under your brow but I've even used it to
brighten up my inner corner but as I
tried to blend it a little bit more it
really didn't do a great job so I think
for me it's okay it's not a bad product
I really don't think it is but it's just
not something I
I would rather on my inner corner just
use a shadow because this is hard to
blend and I don't use this kind of a
product very often under my eyebrows
anyway so I think I'm gonna pass that on
these two have got the Milani in the
cella this is the ivory lace highlighter
I just had this a
it's kind of getting old and gross this
is the almond cream one this one's a
little bit creamier the Milani one is
they are a little bit different of a
shade but the Milani one's easier to
blend so I'm gonna get rid of the cello
one for sure
and I think I'm just gonna keep the
Milani it's an almond cream did I say
that I love that and this is a great eye
primer as well you can literally just
put it all over your lid and then blend
it in and it's a really good eye primer
the last thing these aren't really brow
but I don't know they kind of ended up
in this thing these are my ELF makeup
remover pens I think one of these is
newer yeah and then one of them is older
it's working pretty well but that one's
pretty old I'm gonna get rid of that one
and keep this one I went from having all
of that to just this I think that's
pretty good I mean I still think I've
got four brow things that's probably
still too many but I like that I now
only have one brow gel one little like
highlighter thing things like that so
and again as I use these up I'm probably
not gonna buy every single one of them
again I'll probably just buy one but not
bad I'm very proud of this I'm gonna
tack on my eyeliners here to this
because I realized I don't have a lot
and I don't think I'm gonna get rid of a
lot because I've already decluttered
this pretty recently so I'll set them
out let's go through
okay so here they are it's not a lot and
I I take pride in that because I did
declutter these recently and I've not
let myself buy too many more eyeliners
recently so let's start on this side
let's wait on this so these are my black
pencil liners I use one of these every
single day you could you can tell I
switch between them all because they're
all almost used up because I love all of
these now this is the same thing this is
the it cosmetics no tug gel liner I
don't think I need to keep the both of
them because these will still take me a
while to go through so I think I'm gonna
pass this on again while it's still new
so someone else can use it but this this
Urban Decay one I love I'm definitely
gonna use up the Milani liquid eye one
is amazing the Lancome one is incredible
this anyway one let me try this one I
haven't used this in a while it says
it's their intense color gel eyeliner I
mean they're all good so I don't
necessarily feel the need to get rid of
any of these because I know I will
totally use them up and go through them
and I love that I will so I think when
and if I use all of them up I would
either repurchase the Milani one cuz
it's so good or this Urban Decay one
because they're both they do not budge
it's so incredible the Lancome one is
really good too so I think I'm gonna
keep all of them I get rid of this one
now we've got my colored ones here I
don't have mini because I don't use them
often but I wanted to have a good spread
so I don't want to get rid of I don't
know that I'm gonna get rid of any of
these this gold one is my color pop oh
man I hate when these break it is the
most amazing like copper penny color so
I'm definitely keeping that the only
thing I'm thinking about is I don't know
that I need both of these this is like a
grey and a brown and they're both by
Lancome so this one's in plume and it's
like a grey tone and then this one's in
brulee and it's more of a brown tone
I really don't need both but I really
like them but I don't need them which
will I wear more often I don't know but
I know I'm gonna keep like this blue on
my Lancome is cote d'azur
cote d'azur and it's such a pretty blue
color this purple one is in Poulet I'm
sorry you guys I don't know and it's
another really bright one so I'm
definitely keeping those and then this
one is the pure minerals double ego one
and it's got a pencil side on one and
then it also has a liquid I thought this
was so is that right yeah it's got a
liquid one on the other I thought that
was so neat so this kind of covers
anything I could need color wise and
then I don't think it really matters I
think I'm gonna keep the gray because
it's so different and get rid of the
brown because I can find a brown pencil
pretty much anywhere but the gray I
thought was kind of interesting so I'm
gonna keep those get rid of these these
are all my liquid liners now if you
don't know the way I do my liner
typically I usually start and tight line
with like a pencil black liner then I
will go over in gel liner to thicken the
line and then to make the wing I'll go
over go over everything in a liquid
liner it's kind of like a triple layered
dessert so I like I genuinely use all of
this stuff the Stila stay all day I know
I'm gonna keep because I just bought it
it's my favorite this pixie ones pretty
good but honestly I wasn't as impressed
with it as I thought I would be at first
I was but I feel like after the first
few uses I don't know like it wouldn't
cover the lines the it wouldn't cover
like shimmery shadow is the way I wanted
it to and I have a brand new one as well
so I feel like I'm gonna get rid of it
again while it's still new and I just it
was good but not great this is the scone
tattooed liner you guys this stuff does
not come off it's incredible so I'm
definitely keeping that I like I feel
like I should wipe it off now before it
Oh before it stays on forever
this is the este edit the blackest liner
and it's a thick one and I don't know
it's not as it's pretty black but it you
can kind of see through it so I think
I'm gonna pass it on and then this is
this one's by girl lactic Beauty and
it's in black noir and this yes this
feels like what I like so I'm gonna keep
these three and then get rid of those
these this is my mica beauty one that I
love it's almost gone again it's just
there Jo eyeliner and black it's really
good this one I bought to replace this
when it runs out and I've tried it quite
a bit
and I just don't love it I think it's
one of those it's such a different
formula than this one that it just takes
practice to adjust to the different
formulas but I'm gonna keep it because
it's still good but I'm not gonna
repurchase it when it's right now it's
not my favorite so not great but I feel
like even though I just recently
declared I think I did a good job of
still finding things I can get rid of
and pass on so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
