favorites sorry it's a couple days late
/ like a week late but hey what can you
do
okay so I have a line of a fun mixture
of things I'm gonna start with some
beauty items one thing it's like a
rediscovered favorite of mine was then
it's all worn off so that kind of stinks
it's the NYX stay matte but not flat
powder foundation and I've gotten it in
a shade too dark I have it in nude which
actually might be a couple shades too
dark for me but I think I bought it like
in the summer time a couple of years ago
anyway so like I haven't been able to
use it but now that I've kind of been
self-tanning in things um it's a lot
more usable and I'm wearing it today and
it is the most like pigmented I mean
it's a true powder foundation I don't
know if you can see yeah how I mean it's
just it's so much coverage you could
wear it alone great with the tinted
moisturizer or a BB cream that doesn't
give as much coverage I have been
pairing it with another favorite of mine
which is the wet and wild cover all
Foundation and a lot of people have been
asking me how I'm liking it because I
keep using it in like face of the days
on Instagram and I really like it now
I've applied it with a sigma brush my F
84 brush and I didn't like it as much as
when I applied it with another favorite
of mine the Beauty Blender and with this
it's just like beautified again wearing
it today I'm oyster eyes before I use it
and then once that kind of dries then
I'll use this and it's just a really
nice coverage I never feel like I need
anything more now I don't my skincare
routine which I'm gonna do a video on
very soon is very simple and because
it's so simple I think it's really
cleared my skin up so even without
makeup my skin's a lot better than it
used to be so I'm really excited to do
the video for you guys and I think
you'll be surprised at the products that
I use and you'll be glad because they're
all really inexpensive so that's coming
up anyway because my skin so much better
this works really well I think with the
brush it just like I don't know it's
just like this was just a lot more
flawless and of course
it's the case with any foundation when
you use the Beautyblender it is just
beautiful
it's worth the $20 ish for it and I got
like a 2-pack on Amazon for around 20 to
25 dollars so it's expensive the thing
lasts a long time I've had no issues
with this one that I've been using it's
amazing I can't speak highly enough
about it and that's why you've seen it
in so many videos so these three are
beautiful together
and I'm wearing I used all three today
okay another thing that I've been loving
is this candle they sell these at Target
it's nature's wick okay
you know the brand would wick and those
are kind of pricey I've had one of those
before and it crackles like as it burns
because it's literally a wood wick
well this one's called nature's wick and
it's in the scent apple tree and it
smells amazing it's not like a normal
Apple smell it's like I literally don't
know how it's like a musky apple it is
the coolest scent and the wick is wooden
as well but it's like kind of in the
shape of like a tea or an X however you
want to say that and it really crackles
I had it burning the other day and Tyler
my boyfriend miss like what's going on
it what does that no piece I'm like oh
it's my miniature fireplace over there
and actually I keep it in that I don't
know if you guys can see that little
crystal thing back there wherever it is
um I just took it out to show to you
guys it has a really cool effect I feel
like this would be even cooler like in
the fall and winter and actually this
smell would be a great fall smell but
I've just been too excited so I've been
burning it but I definitely want to get
some more of those cuz they oh I love it
like I said those are sold at Target
okay so my products are like so far over
here I'm like disappearing from you guys
just to get them I don't know why I put
them so far away two nail polishes I've
been loving one I'm wearing on my nails
right now it's bikini so teeny by Essie
it's everyone talks about it and now I
see why and if you've seen my latest
swap video watching my only swap video
so far um with my friend amber which I
will link below oh my gosh she like
spoiled me to death and I am still just
still reeling about it but um she sent
me both these polishes this is just a
beautiful like periwinkle I hear a lot
of people describe it as baby blue but
it's like got a purple tone to it too
like it's like if you mix baby
lavender you'd get this color it really
is like a periwinkle I freaking love it
and I love as he's formula 2 and it's
funny so people are so split on that
some people love se and some people hate
it
and it's just you know it's just your
own opinion and your own nails too and I
have something about that anyway okay so
the other one is tart deco by Essie it's
this beautiful coral color I have it on
my toes right now and it's such a pretty
color it's one of those that if you like
it makes you feel pretty you're like
when you look at your feet like in
Santa's you're like oh like it's so
pretty and it also is kind of one of
those colors that makes you look a
little bit tanner
so if you have maybe pale feet or
whatever it kind of helps to make them
look a little brighter so I really
really like that um I thought would also
look pretty on your nails I'm sure I'll
be painting them on my nails pretty soon
too another thing speaking of nails I
just recently started retaking the hair
skin and nails vitamin it has biotin in
it it has I mean all kinds of things
that are gonna be really good for your
skin for your hair and your nails just
like the name um and I did that because
I've noticed my nails have started like
peeling and they used to do that and so
that's when I had originally taken this
stuff and it really fixed it and then I
stopped just cuz I'm I go well my nails
are good and like the past few months
it's been really bad and so I was like
okay you gotta take them again so I
started taking these again this is the
brand nature's bounty I want to say that
I got this at some drugstore I don't
remember where though but remember you
know I've had this a while so I made
sure to check the expiration date
because they do expire I have until
September of this year to use this up
but there are a lot of coupons by the
way on target.com and manufacturer's
coupon for a brand so you'd be able to
do two dollars off from Target and $2
off manufacturers so be four bucks off
you'd be getting it for like a dollar
too it's just I think it's optimal
solutions so check that out um get you
some because if you're experiencing it
like really brittle nails or really weak
nails or peeling nails this is gonna
really help you if your hair's just
lifeless or you know any of those
problems this is really gonna help so
I'm be excited now that I've started
taking it again to see the effects of it
I've also been using the Moroccan argan
oil it's by the brain organ
I picked it up at I think Walmart but
they sell it at Target Walgreens CVS
it's the penetrating oil and I really
really like this and a lot of people
have said you know you gotta use the
real argan oil and I want to eventually
try like the Josie Maran and things like
that but they're really expensive I mean
must be serious so one day I will but
for now this is only I want to say like
6 bucks and my hair is so much more
silkier than it ever used to be and it's
just easier to manage and you know as
it's air drying it's not freezing up
it's staying nice and as I blow-dry it
after I've let it air dry for a while
it's just really nice so for the first
time in my life I've been able to
blow-dry my hair like with a round brush
you know after using this and I'll be
able to like leave and my hair looks
fine usually my hair is too frizzy I'll
need to use some sort of hot tool but I
don't have to anymore of course I still
do like I used a curling iron today but
it's nice to have the option to not have
to so I really like this stuff it's
inexpensive it's nice I like it okay
you're gonna laugh at this next one
I still have some more makeup ones but
we rediscovered it from my childhood
this is my favorite cereal ever and as
one of those I just forgot about and yes
I know there's like ingredients in it
that are bad for you but I mean come on
it's peanut butter Captain Crunch
there's nothing better to me like I
literally eat this morning and night
it's like my breakfast it's well it's
not my dinner let's be serious I need a
real dinner but I always like if I'm
like hungry before bed which I know is
so bad to eat before bed I'm like I just
want some Captain Crunch out I'm out
it's empty I'm so sad
it's like the second box in like two
weeks I've gone through it's pretty bad
it's so good though like if you haven't
tried this and it's available near you
get it it is so good unless you don't
like peanut butter in which case don't
get it you would hate it okay so this
elf High Definition powder it's not
though translucent one that most people
have that are sold in stores this one I
bought and online it's corrected yellow
and I use it with a small brush
underneath my eyes once I put on my
concealer it is beautiful anything
that's left that the concealer maybe
didn't conceal which usually isn't a
problem but it a septa and B
adds even more corrective qualities so
it's just really nice I think that this
is supposed to be a dupe for the Menai
luxury powder like the banana powder
I think I'm assuming because they're all
finely milled they're both yellow a lot
of people use them under their eyes so I
love this it's six bucks on eyes lips
face comm you can't beat that and I'm
never gonna run it it's filled and I use
the tiniest amount for under my eye okay
another one is also from that swab it's
the color whisper and pin up Peter I'm
wearing it today but all I can put a
little more on it's just like oops it's
just like so chill like it's a peach
color but again it's the color whispers
so they're not too in-your-face some of
them are a lot brighter but this one's a
nice one cuz you really don't need a
mirror as long as you kind of clean up
around your lips um I really like it it
reminds me okay so I love the rebel nut
butter and peach parfait this is like
the non shimmery version of that except
for a different brand I love it so when
I'm not wanting the shimmer from peach
parfait I can grab this and it's
essentially the same color they're
pretty close without the shimmer it's
awesome I love it
and then also the Sonia Kashuk bronzer
okay a lot of people been asking me
about this too mmm
was it amber I think amber was the one
that told me that's supposed to be a
dupe for the Chanel one the Chanel cream
bronzer and it is the cream bronzer it's
in the shade 41 warm tan and like I said
Sonia Kashuk it's sold at Target I use
the stippling brush just the elf like
three dollars small stippling brush
stipple it in their sibling on my cheek
like I do it this way you know what I
mean oh my goodness I'm a mess
so it's awesome it blends so well I'm
learning today I think it's nice
especially if you're lighter skinned
it's you can blend it out well but if
you're a darker skin it still works too
because you don't have to blend it out
as much so it's like it really is
perfect for all shades I'm not sure how
much this is since amber sent it to me
but I know that it's way cheaper than
the Chanel ones so if you're wanting a
cream bronzer get a sibling brush and
you're gonna love this without a
stippling brush I mean I guess you could
apply with your fingers and things like
that but um I think it just
a little bit more difficult to work with
but sibling brush works great so those
are all my favorites if you enjoy please
subscribe and I'll see you guys very
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
