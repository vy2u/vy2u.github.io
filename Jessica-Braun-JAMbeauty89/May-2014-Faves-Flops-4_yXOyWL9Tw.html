favorites and flops so I have a lot of
stuff so let's dig right in so one of
the first things I had to share with you
guys is my new baby this is a new
organizational piece no surprise because
you guys know I'm an organizational
freak but it's bye-bye allegory which is
the brand and they have sent me before
their lipstick holder and then also
they're like compact holder and if you
watch my latest makeup collection video
I think I showed both of them in there
it's not at least the combat I think
both of them are in there they're also
because the acrylic is really really
thick and it's not that expensive so
this is their lip gloss holder just hold
your applause ladies just hold your
applause how has this not already been a
part of my life this is the most genius
idea I mean it's literally just like a
lipstick holder but it's way taller so
it holds them all totally upright I mean
come on it even holds my little lip
liners they're so cute I just was
ecstatic when they offered to send me
this so thank you to them and I'll
definitely put the link for this product
I'm pretty sure bye allegory you buy it
through Amazon but I'm not sure but I'll
definitely have the link below if you're
interested they're awesome super thick I
mean you guys can tell it's it's pretty
solid I love it I just love it anyway
okay so on to some makeup items that I
have been loving first thing is this
Laura Geller balance and Brighton
foundation this has been a standout in
my collection it is just this beautiful
kind of marble looking powder foundation
and I have it in fair and it's got an
SPF of 15 but it just ends up looking so
flawless on your skin you can wear it
alone you can wear it over BB cream you
can wear it over full coverage
foundation and just get even more full
coverage I usually I've used this
set my under eye I really like it that
way too it's just beautiful it's just
beautiful and laura geller products if
you haven't heard of them or if you
don't know much about them there it's
really kind of interesting the way that
they make their makeup but it's
basically like baked on like a bärbel
stone or something like that in Italy I
mean it's really cool but I bought all
of my Laura Geller products for like 50
or 60 percent off on HauteLook comm I'll
also link it below she's on there her
products are on there all the time and
they'll have like kits with this and a
bunch of other things for like 25 bucks
it's insane so love that product another
favorite is this bareMinerals concealer
and well rested this is a yellow toned
concealer and by concealer I mean it is
a powder consistency but it really
conceals and stays put all day it blows
my mind I never thought a powder could
have that good of coverage but it really
does and not only that if you wear it
over concealer it really just brightens
that area oh so much I use it all the
time and it was $18 for the full size
but I'm never gonna use this up like
ever there's the amount you use like on
a daily basis is nothing I mean it's
like microscopic so this is gonna last
me so long another favorite well this is
kind of it's like half favorite half
flop and I'll explain why this is the
Too Faced better than sex mascara what I
love is that the watt there's something
about this wand it's kind of like a
spider you know what I mean it's just
it's so good but the consistency dries
up so quickly now this is a dry formula
as it is which I really like because you
can build on it really quickly and it
like my lashes it's my favorite look
it's like they're like velour they're
like just plump and just I don't even
know how to describe it they're just
perfect and plush that's the word
they're plush but this dried out so
quickly I don't know if it's because of
the trial size or what I know that you
can put some stuff in it to make it kind
of revive it which I am gonna try and
see how well it works with this formula
but I'm like
I want to buy the full size but then I'm
like but I don't want to if it's gonna
dry out in like two weeks has anyone
else had that experience with this I'm
curious because oh my gosh the formula
is amazing I will say though it doesn't
hold the curl as well as I would hope so
I usually will take like my Palladio
curls rule and just kind of put a sweep
of it at the very end just to kind of
hold the curl but the look of this oh
man I love it one of my flops for the
month is this gos bomb stick now I don't
remember the shade name but it's
literally the EOS you know lip balms but
in stick form so like in normal form and
I'm just so excited about this cuz I
just thought it was kind of cute and I
love the u.s. formula but sometimes I
feel kind of awkward in public like
pulling out this huge giant ball and
putting it all over my lips so I was
excited to see this in stick form and
it's sold on targets website I'm not
sure where else but they don't sell it
in stores yet at least on at Target so
it was only a couple bucks but the
formula just dries my lips out and I was
really saddened by that because it
smells great again I don't remember what
like flavor this is but they have like
three I think on the website but the
only oh s bomb that has worked for me is
the sweet mint one and I don't know why
that is obviously the formulas are
different and that one works the rest of
them have always dried me out and this
one was no different so that was kind of
a bummer
I wonder if sweet mint was one of the
other flavors because if it was I might
buy that one because I love the sweet
mint formula another favorite slash kind
of not so this is another like half flop
all of my flops aren't like total flops
they're just like there's kind of a
drawback to all of them this is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer I have it in
the shade light too which is vanilla now
upon first glance I thought this was
really kind of gray toned looking and I
guess my biggest gripe with this it's
nice there's nothing wrong with the
concealer it's just it's not amazing to
me and I don't know if it's just my skin
or maybe I don't know I it brightens a
little bit it conceals a little bit but
I wouldn't call a full coverage I would
it brightens better than my Maybelline
instant age rewind brightener I love
that and not one brightens like crazy I
just didn't really notice anything
that's special about this I was kind of
sad I even wasted the money you know and
like I said I almost feel guilty saying
because I know there's a lot of people
out there that love it I have friends of
mine that love this but for me it just
didn't work as well so I also use it and
I will use this sucker up because I
spent the money out and it's not bad
it's still good but I don't think it's
worth all the money that it costs that's
what I'll say there's a lot better
drugstore concealers out there in my
opinion so another favorite this was
rediscovered
it's the Jordana 12-hour made to last
liner this is in the shade aqua stone
and it's just this beautiful bright blue
I actually have it on my lower lash line
today and I just love this these are
like two or three dollars I have a
review video just on these and the
different colors that you're Dana sells
because they're like two or three
dollars at Walgreens they stay all day
and they're just beautiful colors but
this one is my favorite that's what it
looks like in a swatch look how just
cool that it is ah that's two or three
dollars I've ever spent I love it it's
my favorite color eyeliner in the world
another favorite and this will probably
come as no surprise to some of you guys
is this Anasazi brow Wiz I think I
haven't medium brown this everything
wore off the shade more off just
everything that crazy I hate when that
happens
but there's just something about it I've
never found another brow pencil or
anything that works as well as this does
I mean a lot of you guys have
complimented me on my eyebrows lately
and they're better than they've ever
been mostly because of this it's just
insane it has the spoolie on one end and
then the pencil on the other and it's
just a mechanical pencil this is like
twenty dollars or so but it's worth it
and it's lasted me a while and there's
just something about it I don't know it
just it perfectly will kind of even out
you can put it wherever you need to do
it it looks real and even up close it
looks good I mean all of this is my real
eyebrow anyway but if you are missing
some this is your best bet at making
look natural if that makes sense I have
to brush favorites for the month one is
this diva beauty brush
it's the Beto six-pointed contour this
is this might be my favorite brush ever
it there's something about it it's the
perfect density it's the perfect shape
I've been using it for buffing out
concealer or let me rephrase I'm buffing
it out but buffing it into the skin it
doesn't hold on to the product it just
buffs it into the skin so perfectly but
it's not quite as dense as like the f-84
I think it is or whatever once the
pointed one from Sigma that one
sometimes buffs that like where it
almost busted away it's too dense
this one is perfect oh I love it and
then this is the Sedona lace FBO three
it's there to lip contour I've been
using this for blush and I freaking love
it you can just kind of see it just
perfectly gets the shape you want mmm I
love it so much those are both such
wonderful brushes on to some more
favorites one that I forgot how much I
love it is the Jergens natural glow
lotion and they now sell it in a
freaking pump how exciting is that now
looks like 1295 for the stuck arms like
jay-z's but you can get the regular size
two for like eight bucks but I have like
a dollar off coupon and then like
another dollar off thing or it was on
sale so it wasn't as bad but I love it
and I always get it medium to tan even
though I'm clearly not tan because the
Fair delight really or whatever it is
like medium it's not it just doesn't do
enough to make it even worth it but this
it really just gives a nice glow now I
know you guys are probably looking at me
and thinking you do not look tan at all
but trust me in person and if you know
me I look like probably four shades
darker than usual but it doesn't look
fake it just looks like I've been out in
the Sun a little bit you know I
basically I just don't look like a ghost
so I've got like fake Tanner stuff for
when I'm like maybe going out somewhere
special and I really want to have a
really nice glow but for everyday this
is perfect and moisturized as well and
most of all it slowly adds that color I
just love it I really do and they
finally made it where the cents not as
bad there still is a scent but
really not nearly as noticeable as it
used to be oh my gosh another favorite
is this Neutrogena shampoo this is a
clearly a clear shampoo meant to
basically get rid of all the residue
that's built up and left over in your
hair after days weeks months of using
product in it of all kinds even shampoo
and conditioner so this really just
clarifies your hair it totally gets all
of that out feels very weird after
you've washed it and then I'll just use
a nice moisturizing conditioner
afterwards just kind of replenish my
hair but it really is nice I really only
use it like once a week I don't
recommend using it too often because it
does really clarify but I think it'll
really dry your hair out but I love it
and once a week is just enough for me to
get all that you know the dry shampoo
from the week the hairspray just all the
nonsense that's been in my hair really
strips it in a good way and I love it
another hair product I've been loving is
my agave healing oil oil treatment they
send this to me in I mentioned in the
video where I kind of sort of many
review it the shampoo and conditioner
it's just not for me it was too heavy on
my hair because my hair does tend to get
oily pretty quickly and this is kind of
heavy on my hair too but I've noticed
that as long as I don't use too much it
really is nice it's been protecting my
ends my hair you can kind of see it's
healthier than it has been in a long
time it's just silkier it's easier to
manage my hair dries faster I just love
this stuff it's worth the money another
favorite is my tangle tamer or whatever
it's called I found this at Marshall's
for like 3 or 4 bucks and I heard good
things and I'm so glad I bought it I
love it so it's just it's one of those
products that's so silly looking but it
is actually amazing it really I'm
noticing my I'm losing less hair it
might be a combination I'm using this as
well and then the other brush I showed
that I really like but this is great
great great if you're gonna brush your
hair out especially if it's wet cuz you
shouldn't rush it when it's wet but
sometimes you have to brush it when it's
wet so when in that situation definitely
I love that a few other kind of random
favorites that I just had the men
and some of these I've mentioned in
other videos others I haven't this is my
purse that I got from shop lately and I
love it so much
it was pretty inexpensive for a really
cute purse it was like I want to say
like 25 dollars I might be way off maybe
it was like 30 regardless I love it so
much it's really small but it's kind of
perfect for summer I've been wearing it
kind of crossbody and it's just been
perfect I've taken it on some weekend
trips where we were walking around like
at a park and it was perfect I mean it
never got in the way but it could hold
more than just a little crossbody could
so it really is the perfect size I love
the color they have other colors I'll
certainly link chocolately down below
because they have this in like a
thousand more cute purses for really
better deals than what you're gonna find
in some stores another favorite is my
Erin Condren planner I in the hall that
I did recently where I showed that bag I
had this in my thumbnail and then I
forgot to mention it I act let me
rephrase I did mention it but I edited
it out somehow so I never mentioned
there was some people just knew what it
was other people were like you never
mentioned the planner no like I'm such a
dummy like are you kidding me
but this planners unfreaking believable
and I'm going to be filming like
actually this week or within the next
few days a kind of how I organize my
planner because like I've said I'm a
very organized person just by nature I
guess I don't know but I have some
developed some really good tips I think
and also just some ways that I've made
this work for me and I think it's gonna
be really helpful and I've actually can
you tell I'm really excited to film it
because I've never filmed a video like
this before but I am in love with this
and it's perfect because Erin Condren is
releasing there next year planner it
actually it's like 2014 in 2015 on like
June 12th so it's coming up crazy quick
and there's even more options than what
I got but but it'll start like you can
get 12 month or 18 month but the 18
month one starts in July so when you get
it you'll be like ready to use it
perfect I'm so excited you guys are
going to love it if you don't know about
this planner
oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh I can't
speak highly enough about it it's better
than any planner I've ever owned in my
life
okay calm now so also these shoes I had
to show they're actually my first pair
of Sperrys that I've ever owned and
these are these mint green corduroy ones
sounds stupid cute are these I've only
worn them a couple times but they're so
comfortable I got them for crazy cheap
like I want to say these are what
originally like $100 or is it that much
maybe it's less I don't really know
regardless I got him for like $40 on
HauteLook and actually it wasn't even on
HauteLook it was on their site but it
was through Nordstrom Rack like there's
the whole look where they have the crazy
deals but then on the site you can go to
Nordstrom racks website and then just
browse their stuff that's always on
there and it was on there
they had these I bought a pair for my
boyfriend for his birthday Who am I
kidding he knows I made him pick him out
even though I would have picked out the
same ones that he did but anyway so
we're gonna be walking around our
Sperrys in style look like nerds I love
it though I think his our dark blue
corduroy they're really really cute
anyway so thanks for all the things that
I said that I would have links down
below and then some and I hope that was
helpful and fun for you guys to watch
let me know what your favorites and
especially your flops of them for this
month I can't wait to read them and
please know that I read every single
comment down there and I know I've tried
to comment back as much as I can it's
just hard on my iPad it is not if you've
never tried to comment or let me
rephrase reply to a comment on the iPad
it's very difficult you have to push
like 10,000 buttons just to start typing
to one person I'm like forget it so I've
always got to make sure I got my laptop
for that that was pointless anyway I
hope that was fun to watch and I'll
catch you guys very soon and don't
forget to subscribe
