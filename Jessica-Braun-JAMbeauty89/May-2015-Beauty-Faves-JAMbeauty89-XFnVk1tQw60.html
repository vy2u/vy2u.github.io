my may favorites um I've got some kind
of rediscovered favorites and some
brand-new ones so let's go ahead and get
into it one of my rediscovered favorites
is my naked palette this sucker has been
neglected by me for so long I mean
really and as I've been kind of getting
together my wedding look and what I'm
going to do to my face I've tried a lot
of things and this palette really is
when it comes to shimmery shades like on
the lid it is the best the best I have
never have tried so many cult favorites
and this one is the one I always end up
going back to because when it comes to
light shimmery shades it's it is the top
of the line I love this shade virgin and
I'm probably gonna wear it on my lids
it's just this gorgeous white shade and
it's not too sure me like sin is really
pretty as well and sometimes I'll mix
them but sin is a little bit almost I
don't want to say too shimmery cuz I
like to mix um but I I just I think I
like Virgin a little more but mix
they're even more beautiful I don't know
what I'm saying they're both amazing so
I used naked kind of sloppily in the
crease and buck right in like right in
the crease and then I used virgin and
send mixture kind of on my list but as
I've been practicing for my wedding I
know it'll be a similar look to this so
and then I love using hustle on my lower
lash line I love this palette you know
you spend a lot of money on something
like this and then when you get other
new things you want to play with those
new toys if you will but there's a
reason that so many people love this it
really is amazing so I was so excited to
rediscover that a new product to me is
this ben nye final seal it's a setting
spray and then the idea is that it's
kind of like a hairspray for your face
which is the whole reason setting sprays
were originally around this one smells
like mint I feel like it was like 10 or
12 bucks for this size this is the two
flew announced I will never need more
than this this is something it's got a
lot of alcohol in it so i wouldn't use
it every single day but i'm planning on
using on my way
day and I've used it every once awhile
for special occasions or for when I know
I need my makeup to last a really really
really long time this stuff works you
guys it works better than my Urban Decay
all nighter spray better than lore'l one
this stuff is amazing and it smells like
mint it's great but like I said don't
use everyday I think it would be very
drying on your skin with all the alcohol
a lip gloss favorite this one's from the
drugstore this is the Rimmel stay glossy
and it's in the shade blushing Bell
graves and it's just this really like
grayish pink I don't know how else to
describe at night though I know this
color is really popular right now but
it's just this grayish pink lip gloss I
cannot stop wearing this it is so
beautiful do these have a smell not
really kind of just like a makeup be
smell which I don't mind but it's just
so beautiful these are such nice lip
glosses I this is me I think this is the
only shade i own i want to go buy a
bunch more because these really are nice
nice and they're really really cheap
they're like I think three or four
dollars regular price let alone if you
got them on sale and I think this color
is so beautiful another favorite is this
lip balm now you guys know that i love
my co bigelow my favorite night balm but
this was sent to me by a lovely
subscriber and it's the julep luxe lip
conditioning treatment you guys this
stuff is amazing and I don't know how
much it costs but I when I run out I'm
just gonna have to buy another one
because it I don't even want to waste it
um it's kind of like this peach color I
mean it's clear when it goes on but it
just when I put it on the first time I
tried it was at night before bed when I
woke up my lips with the softest they've
ever been and I had had a lot of dry
skin on my lips because I done that lip
swatch video and um it just healed my
lips it was amazing I just use it now
morning and night I just bought a new
one of this cuz I'd run out but then
this is my new one but this stuff is
amazing oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
it's amazing another favorite this was a
rediscovered one from my collection is
this in cosmetics bye-bye redness now I
have a lot of redness on my nose whether
I've been in this
or not I feel like my nose is just
always red and so when I would use like
really nice foundations like I'm testing
out the make up for ever one for my
wedding even my drugstore it doesn't
matter any of them I feel like no matter
what my nose starts showing that it's
red within an hour of applying anything
this stuff it looks really really dark
comfy I mean look at the comparison it
looks really dark compared to my skin
tone and I'll even show you on my hand
um it's just looks dark but when you
blend it that darkness kind of goes away
and it really does cover redness and
like all day and I forgot I remember
loving this when I first got it a long
time ago and I just forgot about it and
it really does make a difference it's
kind of incredible so this is kind of
the way I use this is as almost like a
primer because I don't typically use
primers anyway so I'll use this and just
put it in the areas i know i get red
like you can see a lot of my freckles
through right here and then the redness
here so i just put it in that area and
right here and then kind of blend it out
and then i'll just put my foundation on
like normal and it really it covers the
redness all day I can't believe I
finally found something that does it I
love it another favorite is this
Maybelline lash discovery I'm going to
need to buy a new one it's in waterproof
which for me is good because my eyes
just water and it's allergy season and
my wedding will be crying so this is the
mini brush waterproof and it's so
amazing at getting your lower lash line
very precise but not only that i am
constantly surprised at how well it will
work on my actual lashes like my upper
lashes it like lengthens them it
separates them I could wear this alone I
don't typically because I like a little
more volume than this would give but
I've like been priming my lashes with
this every single day for the past month
I need to get a new one because I'm
pretty sure I've like use this to death
already but it is incredible I will
always have this in my collection can't
believe I didn't discover it until now
the last favorite of mine is this elf
zip eraser and I had had their roller
ball zip
salicylic acid this has like I think a
higher concentration of salicylic acid
and a few other things and it's kind of
a brush tip and you twist it and it
comes up into it and I had had a few
hormonal breakouts on my chin rubbed it
on it last night I swear they're baked
they like killed it overnight it is
amazing and this stuff is like three
bucks so definitely worth it if you're
at the drugstore and you see it or if
you're placing in alpha order throw this
in your cart it's like three dollars and
it's incredible it kills it overnight
I'm telling you so those are all of my
favorites for the month of May hopefully
you enjoyed i would love to know what
you've been loving and using and what
your recommendations for really long
wearing makeup is cuz i'm getting closer
to my wedding I'm really paring down
like okay I'm pretty sure this what I'm
gonna wear and I know a lot of you have
asked if I'm going to do a video about
the makeup that i'll be wearing and i
will but i might wait until after the
wedding because i have a feeling that
the day that the wedding actually
arrives i'm going to change my mind a
million times so i want to be able to
tell you truthfully what i ended up
wearing and then i can show you pictures
of how will war throughout the day
things like that so wait for that it'll
be a while but i will definitely get
that up for you after the wedding but
let me know your recommendations as well
and i'm also kind of i'm trying to
decide on what blush to wear but i'm
also trying to decide on what lipstick
because i know i want kind of a light
pink not too light though I want it to
look like i've got color but maybe not
in person this pink is pretty is pretty
pink I know and the camera doesn't but
in person it's I think too pink but
maybe something just a little bit
lighter than this so let me know what
your recommendations are I definitely I
learned so much from you guys and I love
you guys so if you enjoyed please
subscribe and I'll catch you guys on my
next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
