going to be reviewing two new Maybelline
holiday palettes and I'm so excited to
share these with you guys because I've
got some interesting things that I've
kind of figured out about them
these are $14.99 at drugstores I've seen
them online at Target and on ulties
website I bought these at a store near
me called Meijer so they're kind of
popping up everywhere but I know for
sure they're available online if you're
interested I can link anywhere I found
it below but let's go ahead and get into
review and swatches of these products so
like I said these are holiday pallets so
I don't know how long they're going to
be available but when I saw them at the
store I freaked out a little bit because
this is one of the first times I've seen
a drugstore brand do a palette that's a
limited edition for the holiday and it's
not just an eyeshadow palette also has
blushes as a lip gloss has a liner and a
highlighter so and like brushes but so
it had a lot going for it and for $14.99
I thought you know that's not that bad
considering there are a lot of products
at the drugstore that are like ten or
eleven dollars like Physicians Formula a
lot of their products are ten to twelve
dollars so it's not that crazy if you
really think about how much comes in
this palette so I'm gonna start out with
my favorite one which is the maybelline
gilded in gold so they have two this is
gilded in gold they also have up in
smoke we're gonna start with this one
this one as the title would suggest has
some golden light shades for the shadows
it's a very warm palette they've got
kind of this rose gold champagne a true
champagne a gold shade and then this
deeper brown shimmery shade for the
eyeshadow quad it also comes with a
black liner that's pencil format and it
has a red lip gloss a kind of peachy
very natural shade of blush and then
when you unfold the little flaps here
there's a little kind of powder puff and
then a very kind of ivory shade
champagne
highlight that's got some glitter in it
so there's a lot that comes in this but
it doesn't matter how much comes with it
if they're all terrible so let's kind of
go through each product the first thing
is the lip gloss so this one comes with
a red one I think with the holidays they
figure it's a good shade it has some
serious pigment to it I mean I was so
impressed the first time I swatches I
thought oh my gosh that's got a lot more
to it than I would have guessed it's a
comfortable kind of creamy lip gloss I
don't think it's anything that's like to
write home about it's not a matte lip
gloss it's truly a regular gloss but it
does have a lot of color which i think
is fun for the holidays now for my taste
I don't love red glosses because if I'm
gonna wear a dark lip like this one I
would rather be more mattifying because
I don't want it to look like it's
running outside of my lip line in any
way which typically happens for me with
glasses that have a lot of color like
this red one it's still really nice one
if you like that kind of a thing though
so the pencil liner that comes in is the
same one in the up and smoked it's just
a thicker black pencil and it's pretty
black I've worn it all week it stays put
I put in my waterline it doesn't stay
there all day but honestly most products
don't with my eyes but it's okay it's
not the best but it's certainly usable
it's creamy enough that you can get it
to work especially for me I used it
today in my just in my waterline and
then kind of is a tight line between my
lashes and it does a great job with that
it glides right on but it's not too
creamy it's kind of right in between
then getting into the shadows here are
some swatches of these the best shade is
the rose gold champagne color because
it's just very creamy and soft not any
fallout but the worst one is the golden
one it's still a pretty shade I'm not
saying it's not usable and I've used it
as well
but it has a lot of powder that kicks up
when you use it whether it's with your
finger or a brush or a sponge tip
applicator so that creates a lot of
fallout beneath your eyes so that's kind
of a downside for me because I don't
want that to mess with the highlight
put on that day so I don't love the gold
I've used it like I said a couple times
I don't think I'll not use it because of
that you just have to be really careful
and the champagne white color is
actually really nice as well the next
thing in here is this blush I love this
this reminds me of a more peachy version
of the Benefit box blush and dandelion
not one is more pink this one is just a
little bit more dusty but I'm wearing
today it is the most natural normal but
flattering shade on my cheeks I've never
tried a blush like this and I don't know
how I have it but it's beautifully
pigmented I know it's hard to see cuz it
almost matches my skin in a way but it
is so there it is it is so beautiful and
flattering and easy to use now what's
amazing is that it's one of the few
drugstore blushes that when I first put
it on especially on this cheek I was
like whoa too much but it blends so well
that I just used some powder foundation
and kind of blended the edges and it
looked a lot better now I'm also wearing
the highlight that's in this palette
because I really really like it this one
here it is so soft and crazy pigmented
but what I love about it is that it
blends to such a beautiful finish that
it doesn't look like a cheap highlight
I've tried quite a few where like every
time I put it on someone said something
to me like oh there's something weird
you know and I'm like no it's my
highlight I'm like oh my gosh this looks
so patchy it looks way too glittery
this one looks beautiful so that is
everything about this palette let's move
on to the up and smoke it's not my
favorite and I don't know if it's
because I mean I've got a couple reasons
but part of it is because I just don't
wear shades like this these there when
everything
I don't wear shades like this with the
blacks and the greys I'll wear them from
time to time but it is very rare now
I've tried them all I used the darker
black shade on my lower lash line
obviously not today but this week I've
worn in actually three or four times and
it's these are nice shadows they're not
bad and actually this white shadow here
is the one I'm wearing all over the
place today for my eye looks
so they're not bad shadows they're just
hot colors I wear so if you already know
your preference you you probably have a
good idea of which palette would be
right for you so the shadows are good
here are some swatches of them they're
nicely pigmented none of them have this
thing kind of fall up as that gold one
other than the kind of medium black one
it's still really pigmented but again
there's that glittery powdery fallout so
and it's in the same location as the
gold one so it's kind of bizarre but all
the other three are really really nice
then the blush is really pigmented as
well it's more of a pink shade with some
glitter but it looks really pretty on
the cheeks I've worn it a couple times
this week both of the blushes have a
surprising lasting power they ended up
blasting me I want to say all day I
teach so at the end of the teaching day
I remember both of them being on my
cheeks that a few times I've worn them I
don't know about the very end of the day
when I was taking it off but I mean they
lasted that would be at least like 10 or
11 hours so very impressive there it's
the same black liner and then it has a
different shade of lip gloss this lip
gloss they don't have names this is the
more pinky tone one and but again it
well this one has some actual color too
it's right there I mean it's certainly a
lot more transparent so that's more your
speed this will be nice and I'm sure
that they paired the lighter shade with
the darker eyeshadow looks because that
really is what you should do kind of
balance out your face so like today I'm
wearing a really light look so I'm
wearing a darker lip and if you're
curious it's not in these palettes but
I'm wearing this Revlon Ultra HD matte
lip color in addiction it's really nice
so the only other thing in this palette
I haven't mentioned is the highlight
there and it's really nice however I do
I mean it's crazy pigmented but there's
a lot of powder there so again there's
fallout and you can even see it in this
swatch it's it's just very powdery it
looks beautiful when it's blended in
correctly but it really highlighted my
imperfections in this area like any
crow's feet you have if it
Cinelli gets up there which I that the
day I wore it it did in highlight and
everything not a good way so out of the
tooth my favorite highlight is in the
gilded in gold it's still not bad but
it's certainly not my favorite hopefully
