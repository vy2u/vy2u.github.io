be reviewing and swatching for you the
new maybelline superstay matte ink lip
colors I have two different shades I
will be very candid it took me a long
time to even want to try these because
I'm kind of tired of matte lips I've
said that numerous videos I know a lot
of you guys kind of feel the same way
not that they look bad on other people
it's more than I'm tired of wearing them
on me it's an exhausting process because
you got to make sure your lips aren't
already dry or chapped
so check once that's fixed most of the
time you want to line your lips or if
you don't you got to be really careful
applying it okay then it's the
discomfort of wearing them it's great
that they're long wearing but they just
end up you know you just don't feel
comfortable wearing it throughout the
day so with that in mind it took me a
while to actually try these I kept
looking at them and thinking about
putting it on and like I'll do it
another day cuz you know if you're gonna
put forth the effort you I want to like
do check-ins make sure see how it wears
and if they're just not comfortable to
wear now that's my feelings on many
matte lip products let's talk about
these in particular I'm on Maybelline's
website and I love to read the claims to
you guys just so you guys can kind of
get an idea of what they say it's
supposed to do and then I can tell you
what does it actually do so it says what
it is super stayed matte ink liquid
lipstick gives you a flawless matte
finish in a range of super saturated
shades they have ten shades the shades
that I have I'll go ahead and swatch for
you now I have 15 number 15 lover which
is what I'm wearing on my lips I'll do
check-ins at the end of this video I'll
put them in I've been wearing this now
for like two and a half hours
I haven't reapplied looks pretty good so
this is lover it does it does dry down a
little bit it's about the same shade
it's just that my lips are kind of
naturally pigmented so it naturally
darkens any lip color I put on it but so
that is that shade and then the other
shade I have is number 20 Pioneer and
it's a really vibrant pretty blue tone
red it's totally like my ally when it
comes to red
I really like this so those are the two
shades again they have ten shades and
there's one that's like more of a dusty
pink so it's a little bit more toned
down than this called dreamer and I do
want to try that one eventually anyway
okay so let's keep going the benefits
they say it has it says Inc your lips
and up to 16 our saturated liquid matte
it features a unique Aero applicator for
precise application and is available in
a range of super saturated shades so
they already said that but the
applicator does like they said it's like
an arrow shaped it does come to a point
when I applied this today I didn't need
to use liner at all and I'm very
impressed so far I've been drinking
coffee water and tea and usually when
I'm doing that with the lip color you'll
start to see like this part starts
wearing away it's still there and like
perfectly line I'm kind of amazed at
that because that I've never seen with
the matte lip color that it stays in the
corners very well but this one did so
they're ratings they like on here
there's like five thousand something
reviews and it's got four and a half
stars 4.4 stars so that's pretty
incredible for a new lip color to have
that many reviews and it's that high of
reviews I think what's cool about these
is that they are easy to apply which
many of them are they're not too creamy
but they're not too liquidy it's right
in between it reminds me of the Oprah
ones but I think these are a little bit
more almost like comfortable not
comfortable like whipped almost like
creamy so some of the some liquid
lipsticks when you put them on they're
very thin and so you kind of like once
you put it on you gotta like let it dry
and then others are like a lot thicker
this one's kind of right in between and
I think that's really neat because it
does make it easier to apply and a
little bit more comfortable to wear now
I will say this and I talked about this
in the check-ins it is sticky and not
like in a it kind of feels like tape
like if you were to take tape and like
scotch tape and put it against your skin
and kind of lightly pull it off that
kind of feel that's what this feels like
not as strong as scotch tape but where
it's not sticky like lip gloss sticky
it's sticky like scotch
sickie so what's interesting though is
there is no transfer at all
so I've kissed my husband no transfer at
all kissed my hand no transfer at all I
can do it right now and I'll show you in
the check-in as well I do the same thing
and there's no transfer so I will say
it's got that going for it as well
let's go ahead and get into my check-ins
throughout the day wearing this lipstick
so you can see how it wears a so it is
1046 and I just applied this like maybe
two or three minutes ago and I wanted to
see first of all it looks really nice I
didn't need a lip liner anything like
that but I wanted to do like a test to
see if it actually transfers nothing
that's pretty awesome I will say awesome
that it doesn't transfer it looks great
at first but it does feel sticky like
the back of a sticker sticky does that
make sense not like gloss sticky it's
very different but it is kind of odd and
that's why I really kind of thought
there would be transfer because it has
that feeling so I'll have to let you
know if that feeling goes away after
wearing it for a while okay so it's like
2:30 ish and I have filmed a bunch of
videos I actually did an interview for
like a news station that sounds weird
like I saw like a something and they
were interviewed about my channel anyway
it was very exciting I was very nervous
anyway so I feel like it still looks
pretty good I've drink tons of tea tons
of coffee tons of water I haven't eaten
yet though so I'm gonna be or have I no
I haven't so we're about to eat some
lunch here in a little bit late lunch
but I think it's looking pretty good
it's not super comfy I will say that
like it still kind of has that sticky
feel I don't know what it is about this
that it's still doing it but I think it
looks pretty darn good
and I feel like the corners are still
staying true which is insane that never
happens with like any lip product ever
so I'm very excited I'll check in in a
couple hours okay so it is 5:30 I've got
a sweet Pinocchio boy here it keeps
hearing noises outside so let's see if I
started around 10:30 it's like seven
hours later
I don't think actually it looks really
good
how is it doing fence I haven't
reapplied at all Hall again that sticky
feeling is still there but I will say
like I've kind of stopped noticing it
and I've been drinking while I'm
drinking some espresso right now and of
course water and we did eat lunch I just
feel like it's staying pretty well I
mean I will say everyone so I'll like
touch my lips and get like that little
like kind of like pills of the makeup
you know what I mean of the lipstick but
other than my crazy hair I feel like it
it looks pretty good for seven freakin
hours in Wow I'll check in in a little
while I mean it's not like super comp
but it's pretty good don't make fun of
everyone's like it looks so dry I'm like
no that's just that's just the lines in
my lips I can't help it it's hereditary
okay it is nine o'clock it's nine
o'clock and I'm ready to take my makeup
off
okay says hey it's 9:00 it's time for
bed not quite he looks a little back
there anyway but I wanted to give you a
final update so I do think obviously it
started out we're off what do you want
to play anyway um I think it looks
pretty good I just think it if I had
done at darker color I think it would
have been more obvious how much it is
worn in the middle you see what I mean I
feel like it kind of blends into the
color of my lips so it's not as obvious
but it has worn a lot so I this is I'm
very very impressed with this lip
product but I I think it's one of those
things that you'll kind of want to touch
up throughout the day just to feel a
little more put together but I think you
could probably get away with wearing it
all day long if you really wanted to I
just think you'd probably be better off
applying it at least one more time or
just taking it off so you feel more
comfortable cuz I don't know wearing it
through eating was not super-dee-duper
comfortable and I have a feeling while
my lips don't
super dry dry I have a feeling if I did
this all the time my lips would be very
dry it out and I will say this too it's
a lot more comfortable my eyelid should
literally falling off it's time it's
time to take these off anyway um I feel
like this is a lot more comfortable
however then lip scent and I feel like
it lasted better than that to just
saying so all in all I think it's good I
actually really do it's very rare to
find a good drugstore matte lip color
that genuinely does last pretty well and
I think this lived up to what they said
now 16 hour wear I mean anything you're
wearing for 16 hours whether it's
foundation I show it's not gonna look
the same as when you first put it on
period now that being said I don't wear
lip colors that long they really dry out
your lips no matter what you're using
it's not good for your lips so for me
this would be something that I would
feel comfortable putting on in the
morning before work and then maybe come
lunchtime either looking in the mirror
and either taking it off just because I
don't like wearing lipstick all day I
just don't
or reapplying it because I don't think
just leaving it as it is is going to
look great by the end of your work day I
mean that's true for pretty much
anything so for the price point under
$10 in most places I think this is
actually a really good lip color from
the drugstore really was surprised
considering my feelings just towards
matte lip colors in general so if this
sounds up your alley I think you'd
really like it do you need to get a
bunch of shades probably not if you're
looking for a long wearing red this
would be a great range to try for me I
really like this for work so I'm kind of
excited to try this out at work and see
how I like it for everyday because it's
a little bit bolder than just wearing
you know a light lip gloss but it's not
as striking as red so I think for me
this is totally perfect these do have a
slight sweet scent nothing that you
really noticed putting on but it is it
is there so if you're sensitive to
fragrance at all you might pick up on it
you might not like it but kind of smells
like sweet light vanilla but again it's
nothing too overpowering and I will say
it takes maybe a minute or two for it to
actually dry down before it is trans
for proof the price point on these is
like $9.50 give or take obviously
Maybelline they have sales and coupons
so you could always wait for that as
well
and of course by one given half off
sales are great because you could try
two shades if you really wanted to or
you could just get another Maybelline
product and one of these to try out the
packaging itself is really nice because
it's like a matted feel on this part and
then kind of a glossy white on top I
think it looks and feels very well-made
and I just think I think it looks nice
they also have like if you're into like
that bright orange they have a shade
called heroine that looks more of like a
warm red kind of a yellow tone reddish
orange they have some really deep colors
like escape this looks like a deep deep
purple Loyalists looks like a super like
kind of brownie nude but like I said
dreamer I would love to try I wouldn't
mind trying the hero and heroine one
just because it's that really kind of
trendy orangish red that would be pretty
and they also a bright purple called
creator so lots of different options
there okay so removal however I stopped
filming and I thought no you need to see
this trying to take it off it definitely
stains and think about it that's only
been on my hand for you know 10 minutes
maybe so make sure you've got a good
makeup remover before you put this on
your lips so hopefully this review was
