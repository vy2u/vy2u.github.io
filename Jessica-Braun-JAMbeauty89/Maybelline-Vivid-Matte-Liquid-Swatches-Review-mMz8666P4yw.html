bringing you a review and lip swatch
video of the Maybelline vivid matte
liquid lipsticks and these are kind of
matte they're marketed as vivid matte
lip color but it's not totally matte
it's kind of more of a satin but
honestly you know this matte lip trend
that's so popular it's so drying on your
lips or at least if you're normal like
me like my lips I feel like are they're
not typically chapped
but matte lipsticks just bring out any
dryness like I could fit they probably
do make them more dry they just suck the
life out of my lips and I already have
kind of like I have bigger lips but
they're also like I don't know like
there's like craters in them I don't
know
so because they're already so there's so
much texture on my lips naturally even
when they're not chapped matte lipsticks
really just don't look great on me all
the time but these I kind of like
because they're kind of pillow soft and
they they just feel more moisturizing I
guess is all this so no they're not 100%
matte I'll tell you that straight off
the bat before even see this with
Hodgins but they do have this way more
comfortable feel it looks beautiful on
top of lipsticks it looks beautiful on
its own with or without lip liner so
I've really grown to like these
Maybelline actually sent me and I of
course I was like maybe week send me
something like it just seems it just
doesn't make any sense to me I'm like
I'm just a dumb-dumb like why are they
sending me things but um I have six of
the shades they have ten and I'm looking
on ulties website where they have them
they have like a crazy dark purple and
like a really really dark like oxblood
reddish almost black I don't have those
but I have I think almost all of the
other ones these are $7.99 at the
drugstore you can find these on sale
like almost always or coupons I mean
come on but it's not terribly priced but
I would still say wait for a sale I'm
also going to be giving away these four
so stay tuned to the end to find out how
to enter my giveaway so let's go ahead
an get
to the swatches of these
so as you can see that you know some of
the colors are kind of similar but I
really like the new ones more than
anything
nude flush is my favorite out of all of
them I think for my it just works really
well with my lips I also do like nude
thrill which was the first one you saw
so that was number five and number ten I
really like those the brighter ones are
fun too it is more of a moisturizing
texture and I worry that they'll slide
everywhere I haven't had that experience
yet with them but I haven't worn these
like for five hours at a time so the
giveaway I mentioned Maybelline sent me
a bunch of these and I actually had
already purchased with my own money some
of these because I wanted to try them so
some of them I have doubles up now that
I haven't even opened so I'm gonna give
away number five ten fifteen and twenty
so if you are curious about how to enter
to win these it'll be really easy down
below there'll be a link that will take
you to the giveaway page and you can
enter in a bunch of different ways let
me know what your favorite shade is down
below hopefully this video was helpful
for you guys and I hope you subscribe to
catch more of my lip swatch videos and
