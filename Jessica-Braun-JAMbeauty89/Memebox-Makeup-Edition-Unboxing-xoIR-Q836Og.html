another makeup subscription box video
for you these are getting fun to do and
I know some people who like I don't
really like it and that's no big deal
the thing is that's the beauty of
YouTube you can just watch some videos
not watch the others I mean that's just
the way it is because some people like
no stop doing so many subscription boxes
like I know but my other subscribers
really like them so you know try to find
that balance but I was recently sent the
Meany box which is if you haven't heard
of it it's all over YouTube really it's
a Korean beauty box subscription service
now this is different than most it's not
a monthly subscription service so really
I shouldn't even use the word
subscription box because it's not a
subscription it is runs around 23
dollars the prices vary depending on
which box you pick and if you go to
their site there's a list of like 40
boxes I looked I was like whoa like
there's way too many you can click
through and you don't even know what set
up but basically you pick one and it's
always the same thing in the box so this
is I think the original Meeny box I
didn't see a number or anything and they
all run for around $23 some are more
expensive some are a little less I think
this one was around 23 but this is a
beauty one they have one so that's just
skincare and all kinds but it's
basically a one-time purchase so you buy
it once and if you want to buy a
different one you can buy a different
one I mean there's this one there's like
super box lucky box there's like a
million but it's all the same company if
you will so this is the Mimi box let's
dig in
super cute pink box okay so it's got
some stuff written on the box it's hard
to read consistence on silver it's white
on silver what were they thinking just
says the hottest beauty trends from Asia
there's okay just it's called the Mimi
box makeup edition if that's the thing I
don't know but it goes through what's in
here which is nice it looks like there's
five products in here I did read that
it's typically four to eight full-size
beauty products so this one has five
some obviously might have more some
might have less but they are all
full-size I'll start with me let's start
with this one this is called the cheek
room makeup base and it's basically it
retails for nine dollars and it is a
full-size
and this is in the green shade and it
says that it's a waterproof of
moisturizing makeup base it's made from
various flower extract Silla powder and
art pearl it will provide the perfect
first layer of your skin makeup skin
makeup but face makeup by maintaining
your skin moist silky and translucent
for a natural look so it's just a
colored primer I'm curious about the
swatch there so there's the swatch green
but it certainly buffs out and of course
green is great for canceling out redness
and really that would be something I
would suffer from more than anything
just a little bit of redness so that
actually might be really nice it
certainly feels nice and silky smooth
not too silicone feeling like the
Smashbox one that I really like so it's
a little less which is kind of nice and
it felt it feels moisturizing so I have
to say I actually might use this and I'm
weird about primer but I actually might
alright let's move off the next thing in
here is the dr. Young anti pore pore
eraser balm and it retails for $38 and
it says it's enriched with witch hazel
extract Swiss Alpine herb extracts
marine collagen vitamin v what's vitamin
v the pore eraser balm is a primer
perfect for featuring the soft silky
porcelain skin
this pore primer will fill in all fine
lines and enlarged pores and control
excess sebum for a long-lasting look
that's kind of nice that actually really
is nice so again I kind of don't love
that I got two primers but these are
very different purposes so I don't know
that I would use these together how it
worked but I love the idea behind this
as well so we will see and again the
packaging for multi is really cute and
well made so the next thing I see in
here whoa it's flying at me is this
looks like an eye liner maybe let's see
what it says
some must say the spot eraser concealer
pencil number 5 now this retails for $8
it's almost too dark for my skin
that's ridiculous I am sold pale well
but when you blend it out it actually
looks nice this looks very similar to
the little pencil that comes in the hard
candy glamoflauge one one that I always
just kind of throw away now this isn't
meant for you
right meant for like spot concealing
like I've got a few breakouts on my chin
so that might be really nice and it
really it actually does feel
surprisingly creamy so that's exciting
rock rock'n'roll another thing I see
these are the cutest packaging this is
the NSM reborn sorbet tint I'm assuming
it's a lip product I guess we are about
to see ok this packaging is adorable
it looks like it is a bright red lip
tint it feels very nice and moisturizing
it certainly super pigmented and the
brush is one of those sort of doe foot
applicator that kind of have that oval
shape to them if you will like a pointed
oval so that is interesting the
packaging is cute and it actually has
kind of a nice smell go figure
I wonder if it does anything special huh
this says it creates a biofilm over your
lips to protect and maintain moisture
and nutrition within what makes them
prod makes it special as the texture
when you apply them they instantly melt
into your lips with the soothing and
cooling feeling without being too glossy
or sticky that would be awesome so
actually that's pretty all over there
okay the last thing in here this
packaging could not be cuter oh my gosh
this is just the box it is a blush it
says yes in this retails for 15
oh that lip gloss by the way retailed
for 21 so this one's 15 if I could get
it open oh yeah oh interesting color
can't say I have one this color this is
a very orange but like a light peach
orange blush and it says it's a soft
micro textured blusher which can be
layered multiple times without sticking
together and blocking up your pores
it'll naturally blend onto your cheeks
and maintain its vibrance all day long
this actually really is a really pretty
blush and I don't have anything like it
and it has a nice Sheen like a satin
Sheen to it without looking glittery so
lady Kim for the win that's the brand
did I say that lady can blossom blusher
so those are the products let's see so
going through the prices the green
primer was nine dollars the pore eraser
balm was 38 the conceit
pencil was 18 the lip-balm that cooling
lip balm was 21 and the blush was 15
that totals to 101 dollars in retail
value that is insane so certainly for
paying if this was I think it's $23
definitely worth your money now if these
are products you would like I have to
admit these actually are all products I
would like I don't have a green primer I
don't have a pore eraser now I've got
plenty of lip glosses I mean that's uh
something but it really is a pretty
color what I wear it all the time
probably not so that's not a total win
for me like the blusher I don't have one
like it and they concealer pencil I
actually don't have one because I got
rid of my glam flaws one really because
I didn't use it that often but maybe I
will now that I have like freaked out
City I don't know so these were kind of
like in these totally awesome certainly
worth the money again if you have twenty
three dollars to spare so definitely
look into it click around their site if
you are interested because it is
interesting the way it's set up it is
it's different well what is kind of nice
about it is you're getting to try things
outside of our country and outside it
well of course a lot of our makeup
products aren't made here in America but
try things outside of our country and
just try different things you know
people use different ingredients and so
I'm really excited to give these a try
and this was certainly an interesting
experience for me so hopefully that was
helpful for you guys in your quest for
makeup boxes and I'll catch you guys
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
