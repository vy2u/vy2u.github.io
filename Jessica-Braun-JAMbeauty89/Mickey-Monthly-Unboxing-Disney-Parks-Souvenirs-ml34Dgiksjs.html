have boiled egg in my teeth I don't know
I feel like I do it's good thing you
guys can't smell my breath
alright so today I have got a exciting
and exciting oh my gosh this is a rough
start yeah I've got an unboxing of two
boxes and they are Disney themed and the
company is called Mickey monthly they
sent me these two boxes I wanted to
share them with you guys cuz I was so
excited this is not sponsored or
anything I'm just choosing to unbox them
on my channel because I think it is such
a cool idea and I had to share it with
my fellow designers out there so let's
go ahead and unbox them so they have two
different editions they sent me the
first one I'm going to open is the one
I'm the most excited about and it is
their theme park edition and this one
starts at $29.99 a month these are all
things that are purchased within Disney
theme parks whereas the other box is
just Disney licensed things so I'm
excited for both but let's start with
this one so the first thing in here it
is this signature puzzle now we've
actually already bought this because we
love these signature puzzles I think we
have two we have this one of sorcerer
Mickey and then another one so I think
I'm going to save this and gift it to
someone in my family that also likes
puzzles and Disney because I know they
would love it we already have it but
this is amazing because these are kind
of privacy in the actual parks and we
love them they're so gorgeous and
magical so that is amazing the next
thing in here oh my gosh is this cute
spoon rest in its Mickey's hand so it's
yeah it's authentic Disney parks
products this one is so cute you just
said it you know if you want to put on
your stove or next to your stove you can
set your spoons as you're cooking in it
we both love to cook so this will
definitely be use and it's so cute
so the next thing oh it's one of those
windows stickers so it's just Mickey and
it's a vinyl with vinyl windows sticker
so I my husband and I might fight over
who gets this one I think I'm gonna try
and sneak it onto my car
was that even telling anyway it's so
cute so that is awesome
already this is like $40 worth of stuff
so and there's still a little bit more
so that's pretty amazing oh my gosh the
next thing in here I've always wanted to
try these these are the Disney Park
shortbread rounds let's try them right
now
I love shortbread Oh ahh and it's one of
those cookies like they're not really
super sweet but there's something about
them that's just so good so comes just
like this oh my gosh I am really excited
to try these look how adorable the
actual cookie is oh my gosh it's got
Mickey's little face okay I love
shortbread so much think about
shortbread is they're really drying in
your mouth but they're so good so those
are amazing oh my gosh so buttery
the next thing oh yay it's this Mickey
shaped rice krispies treat and it looks
like it might have like white chocolate
or something on the back as well I love
rice krispie treats we get one every
time we go to downtown Disney always get
like a different one so I will
definitely eat this that is awesome
inside note in the box you've got these
tiny little Mickey confetti zin here as
well it's adorable or confetti guess
it's already plural also it did come
with a card and it's got the castle and
it says a world of thanks it's home
thank you it's an honor to have such a
magical new member with very big wishes
Mickey monthly so that is absolutely
adorable so that was the theme park
edition box for this month um that's a
lot for what you're paying so if you
know you love this kind of stuff and you
have it in your budget that is awesome
so the next one is their original Mickey
monthly box oh my gosh I'm so excited so
these are things not necessarily from
the parks they're just disney items so
first thing is this these Mickey Mouse
Jelly Belly's that's so cute I love
Mickey oh my gosh she's so cute I might
bring this to school with me eat it when
I need a little boost Oh they've also
they got the card in here as well anyway
another thing oh it's this little horse
statue and this has never underestimate
the value of doing nothing you're oh my
gosh she's so cute
I might bring that to school
while maybe I'll put it back there I
don't know I like that though it's like
in that book Eat Pray Love where they
talk about um I think she was in Italy
and she was talking about the pleasure
of doing nothing and that you know a lot
of us are not very good at just doing
nothing and just relaxing and clearing
your mind for a little bit you know
we're always so busy our minds are
always preoccupied with things or we
feel like we need to be doing something
and it really is good to just slow down
and do nothing for a little bit I love
that oh my gosh no way look at this it's
a villains Cup that just gets me excited
for Halloween
so we've got Ursula Maleficent the Evil
Queen the Queen of Hearts Cruella De Vil
this is awesome and it's just a water
bottle I think it's the kind yeah just
flips up oh my gosh I will definitely be
using this that is so fun oh my gosh
next thing is this little hand sanitizer
and it's got mini and it's got a little
thing you can clip on that is awesome I
will definitely get use out of that how
cute the next one is this little glass
that says love and it's got little
Minnie Mouse for the oh that is adorable
you know other than for the obvious
intended purpose of a shot glass you
could also use it to just put little
things in like on q-tips or you could
put pencils in it honestly since this is
a taller one so cute the last thing in
here is in this little bag let's see oh
it's a pin it says 2016 that is
absolutely awesome because we just
started collecting pins this past year
on the past few trips we've gone on so
that is awesome that's going to be added
to our collection it's so cute so that
one starts at $19 a month and that was a
lot of stuff in this one so that's a
really good deal too and I know I'm
looking at their website right here and
they also have a pin addition and it
starts at 795 a month so if you know
you're just in depends you'd like to get
some pins each month that's a nice
option as well so I will have their
website linked below where you can see
all the information I'm looking at right
here and I will have that promo code
below as well hopefully you enjoyed this
