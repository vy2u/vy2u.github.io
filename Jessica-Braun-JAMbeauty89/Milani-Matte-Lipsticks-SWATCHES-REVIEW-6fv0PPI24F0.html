going to be reviewing the Milani matte
lipsticks I have 5 of the shades I had
had one of them for the longest time and
I kept wanting to get more but I think
they recently released a bunch more so I
just went bonkers the other day at CVS
and bought four more so today I'm going
to show you swatches of these and then
go through the pros and cons of these
lipsticks and whether or not I would
recommend them if you're interested just
in a certain shade I have time stamps of
each swatch on my lips down below so
definitely check below if you're
interested and let's go ahead and get
into it
so in regards to the formula of these
these are very very creamy and very very
thin and what I mean by that is when I
apply even the smallest amount it's just
such a thin layer but it's got so much
color and like I feel like a lot of the
other matte lipsticks that I've tried
they're amazing but you have to put on a
lot more or even if they're really
opaque right off the bat it's just like
a really thick layer this is so thin and
it just stays put it reminds me of if
you took like a matte liquid lipstick
and put it into lipstick form because
the way those works you put a thin layer
on and it's just like BAM and then it
dries and it just stays put these are
just like that but they're easier to
work with in my opinion because it's in
a lipstick form so like when I put on
this map beauty it just it's such a thin
layer it does come off though they don't
like dry down where if you kissed
something now they're still gonna come
off but they just feel so comfortable it
feels like a lip balm i I've never tried
one like these now what I will say is
because they're a thinner formula I
noticed that after about like I had this
on for like an hour after about an hour
it does start to go out hair just a
little bit but that's something that no
matter what looks like I'm wearing I'm
always going like that
just to make sure that I don't have like
clown mouth going out but ah I just it
actually stays on the inside of your
lips really well and for me with red
lipstick that is my pet peeve when I'm
wearing a darker or a brighter lipstick
and the inside is like not colored with
the lipstick this stuff stays on the
inside the whole time
I like I've never tried one like this I
love this so much so these have kind of
a vanilla scent to them because the
other Milani ones that aren't matte have
that really really strong like
watermelon or cucumber whatever scent
that is makes me sick I used to have a
few and I got rid of all of them even
though I love the formula because it
really made me sick to my stomach
these have just like a light
which I really liked it's nothing
crazier in your face in my opinion but
they also have a pretty good color range
so you can tell I would definitely
recommend these to you if you're
interested in any of my other lip swatch
videos I do a lot of drugstore lipsticks
swatch videos did that make sense I can
link those below and if you enjoyed
please subscribe for more makeup videos
and I'll catch you guys in my next one
