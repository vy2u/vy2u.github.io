going to share with you guys the next
installment of my is it worth it video
series so today's is it worth the
product is the milk makeup blur stick so
they sent this to me and I kind of felt
like this gimmicky it kind of seems
gimmicky because there's a million blur
like pore filling blurring kinds of
primers out there and they're not
typically in stick form and so I thought
seems kind of gimmicky is it actually
going to work so I put it to the test to
determine okay is this $36 products
actually worth $36
because when you spend a lot of money on
a face product a not going to last
forever you're either going to run out
of it or it'll go bad so you want to
make sure it's totally worth your money
it's that amazing that you're actually
going to spend $36 on a friggin pore
filling product right so let me show you
me applying it and kind of my soft as I
put it on for the very first time on
whether or not it's actually worth your
money so let's try this out so you just
kind of open it up and you can twist
this little guy up and down so you know
no biggie if you twist it up too far you
can twist it back down and the way I
understand it is you're supposed to put
it anywhere that you've got fine lines
or pores that you want to be more
flawless I have fine lines on my under
eye of course I have large pores on my
nose even up here kind of basically in
my t-zone and down here so I'm just
going to kind of I kind of need a mirror
do i sorry if this gets oh it's on the
Lincoln so I'm just going to put it on
my nose setting much and then I'm going
to put it in that ole region it has to
kind of I want to say waxy but
definitely waxy it's not like a wet feel
to it in any way am I putting too much
on I don't know but it holy moly so it
instantly kind of it like tells them in
I mean it feels like a very smooth
canvas I almost don't even feel like I
need to like blend it in that's how thin
that it just goes on what am i trying
say it goes on so thin that you don't
really feel like you need to blend it in
Wow now I don't think you guys would be
able to notice a noticeable difference
necessarily I don't know maybe you can
but I wish you guys could feel it
because it feels so so good I'm going to
put some of my under eye and we'll see
if that helps and I can see what go on
smooth they're like kind of filling
those lines kind of blend that in so
let's apply some foundation while we're
at it just to see how it performs let's
just go ahead and do the Revlon
Colorstay whipped it's in front of me
cuz I haul this on the drug store but I
tried so many shades of this foundation
I love this foundation but it can tend
to kind of cling to dry patches in a way
I don't think it's bad for dry skin
because I have dry skin but I do think
like if you get severe dry skin is can
cling to it let's go ahead and apply
this and see how it does I'm just going
to kind of start in the middle and I'll
get a little bit more on the second I'm
just using a Sedona lace
sbo seven brush I just use this brush
all the time I don't talk about it much
I'm not an affiliate or anything like
that I just like the brush because you
can stipple with it if you want you
could you know rub it in if you will I
mean it's just it's just such a good
brush oh my gosh okay so it's just
gliding on top are you guys seeing it
holy moly I mean usually when I apply
let me look at it up close make sure I'm
not crazy I mean I've never had a
product that worked like this let's try
it my cheat I mean really we've already
attacked the regions where I have most
pores so this is more just let's see how
it does I'm going to even let a little
bit of foundation get on my under eye
that's what I usually do anyway and see
if it sinks into fine lines just kind of
stippling it first I'll kind of rub this
region a little bit so I can still see
my fine lines I don't think it's like
curing
wrinkles that would be awesome right but
it kind of like I usually have a little
bit more fine lines over here like these
those little creases everything sinks
into and also try it with concealer and
second but like over here it does look a
lot more flawless and it usually does
let's blend this in before it sets and
only responds by the way if you're
curious I'm going to show you two
hundred and Revlon Colorstay I've tried
150 that one has a little bit more of a
neutral gray tone which I like that's
what I used for years but I kind of felt
like I needed something a little bit
darker but I think this is good I also
tried like 250 numbers a little bit too
dark Wow
so the verdict on the foundation this is
the best rub on college day has ever
looked on my face now this is actually
what I wore on my wedding day and I wish
I'd known about this blur stick because
it looks so much more just nice just
nice nice nice so clearly I was very
impressed um I really had low hopes for
this I know that sounds terrible but
when you check so many products you kind
of feel like oh okay I'm sure this one's
going to work and it never does you know
but I was just so impressed with this
product so I do think it's worth your
money I think the packaging is actually
really cute it's kind of got that blurry
look to it too matte finish I like that
the lid just kind of twists off you feel
like you can really close it and feel
confident that it's not going to pop
open and I like that you can twist it up
and down as you use more and more of it
I while I wish this were cheaper than
$36 if you really have pores that you
need to fill in I think you're going to
love this it's one of the only the only
thing that's kind of come close let me
see if I can the only cheek product that
is has a similar effect although a very
different actual product is the NYX pore
filler I really feel like even though
this is you know five six seven bucks
it does a great job if you just put it
on your poor regions it does a great job
of filling them in I do think the milk
one is better though but again if you're
like I can
than all $40 I understand I would say go
for the next one because it's so much
cheaper it's got a really similar effect
like I said I don't think that this
necessary lives up to the claims of like
sealing and wrinkles so that you can't
see those fine lines I think it might
make it a little better as I said before
but not totally gone but I do think I
mean just looking at my completed makeup
look now I do think it did an amazing
job of filling in pores like even when I
look at myself with all my makeup on up
close I feel like it looks so much
smoother than it usually does not as
much like texture and weirdness and I
feel like my nation is actually going to
stay on so using this instead of a
primer if that's what you really need in
a primer then this stuff is amazing it
doesn't have like a strong smell but
it's not of course there is a slight
smell but I didn't notice it all when I
was putting it on and honestly being
that close it is so slight I don't think
like if your senses drink it it's not
going to bother you at all it's oil free
I don't know if it meant I mentioned
that before
even looking at the reviews like on
sephora's website a lot of people are
like I was pleasantly surprised I was
really shocked you know totally worth
the height it's magic for your face I'm
telling you it really is amazing and I
thought it was going to eat now I also
have like the milk holographic stick in
that one it's cool but again like I said
it was kind of gimmicky in that are you
really going to use that in your
everyday life like I would never I don't
think I would ever buy that just to wear
because I I just would never wear it I
haven't worn it since owning s watched
it it's really cool but I'm never going
to wear it so I hope that that helps you
decide whether or not you need this in
your collection I'm trying to be better
about letting you guys know you know I
don't want you to feel like when you
watch videos on YouTube that you have to
go out and buy everything I want you to
feel like you're watching it to make an
informed decision about things you
actually need and not just buying
everything that's out there that's good
does that make sense if you're
interested in more of my is it worth it
