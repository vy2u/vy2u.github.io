another beyond the packaging video I did
one recently about coffee a because they
were one of those brands that I would
see on like BuzzFeed or like it would be
shared on Facebook a bunch of people I
knew that we're like oh my gosh I love
this brand I'm like what is this it
looks so trendy like a packaging looks
so cute and yet the prices were still
kind of expensive for certain things so
I thought I'm going to try this out let
you guys know what I think and what's
good out there and that brand so I will
link that below but milk is another
brand I felt the same way about where
their packaging they all have the same
look to them where they have you know
like their sticks all look very very
similar and for some reason I was like I
was just drawn to it and I know I'm not
alone in that and milk has sent me
actually I think they sent me all of
this stuff and so I was a little bit
like what is this brand all about you
know and if you guys know me if you've
watched any of my videos you know that a
lot of the products by owner sent to me
and I will talk negatively about them if
I don't like them it doesn't matter
they're not paying me to say any of this
I should talk about them not talk about
them whatever so I'm choosing to share
my honest opinion about all of these
products let's get into it I want to
start with the thing I'm the most
excited about this is a new release from
them and it's their macho's toner their
big gimmick with this is that a lot of
their products are very TSA friendly
because they're products that could have
been in a liquid form but they're not so
they don't have to take up space in your
carry-on liquids bag if you carry on
like I do we're going to Spain in
Ireland here in a few weeks it might be
even sooner depending on what I upload
this video but we're going to Spain in
Ireland this summer and for me we no
matter our this trip will be like two
and a half weeks long I still carry
everything on I just I don't like to
over pack so I don't and that liquids
bag is precious space so if I can save
space in there I like to it retails for
$26 it has the same packaging as a lot
of them do where you can roll up the
stick or roll it back down and it's so
friendly to the eyes I just love looking
at it but what they say it's a solid
toner made with matcha for purified
pores and smooth hydrated skin it says
it's the solution for pores and dryness
and dullness uneven skintone but it says
it's the world
solid facial toner and that was why I
was like I want it I need it so what
I've been doing is after I wash my face
and I'll show you a cleanser they have
as well after I wash my face I'll just
put this all over my skin and let it
sink in and then I'll put on other
products my moisturiser etc it's so cool
and I feel like toner is one of those
things I don't always use that in my
skincare regimen that I know that I
should this is a great way for me to
just quickly slap it on without really
even thinking about it
I thought it would feel kind of weird
going on I will say every time I put it
on I feel like oh I missed a spot and
I'm like well I probably didn't miss a
spot but I just like go crazy with it so
I feel like I'm going to run out of it
quickly but I don't know because I've
been using this for a couple weeks now
and I feel like I haven't run down at
all so they say it detoxifies protects
with ingredients like kombucha and witch
hazel so witch hazel like you can buy
pure witch hazel to use but witch hazel
helps visibly tighten pores absorb
excess oil
cactus elixir elixir combs and hydrate
skin so it's just awesome this is one
that I probably will travel with just
because I know that how my skin gets
like if I'm on an airplane I could
easily just throw this on my skin so
this is one I totally recommend if
you're into that kind of a thing I think
it's awesome and really kind of
world-changing for me one of my original
forays into the brand was their blur
stick and there's so much hype on
YouTube about this the idea is that you
can put it on your face obviously as
almost like a primer step so if you've
got pores that you want to blur and fill
things like that this is perfect for
that and again it's cool because it's in
stick form whereas usually that kind of
stuff like I think it's the NYX pore
filler or the benefit Porefessional
where it's kind of more of a cream that
you squeeze out and put on those areas
well this is more expensive than the
toner this is $36 again this is
something that I feel like I'm never
going to run out of and it's just this
very waxy balm and for me I just put it
on my nose in kind of this region here I
do my chin and up here so I really don't
need it out here or like here because
those aren't areas that I feel like
needs that kind of silly but what I love
about it is I do feel like it fills my
pores but it also holds onto the
foundation my nose and I know a lot of
you guys are the same is notorious for
just being read but also for that that's
always the first place my makeup wears
off by each my nose you know whatever
and it's allergy season right now that's
where it usually rubs off and when I use
this I do notice a pretty big difference
in how long that foundation stays in
that spot so I really appreciate that
and again one of the things that doesn't
take up space in the liquids bag yeah so
another product that they're known for
are their holographic sticks now the
original one that I had tried was super
nova now this is one that's very
iridescent these are $28 the other one I
have is Mars supernova is very
holographic and so it's one of the
things that like it's genuinely purplish
silver if you are into that and it looks
so beautiful on some skin tones or just
some people more power to ya this is one
that for me I can't make work for every
day the best way I've made work is I put
it on my hand and then just get a little
bit on my finger and tap it on and even
that I feel like it's just too much so
for me I like having it around I'll play
with it sometimes but I'm just like and
I know you guys probably do this too
I'll just like look in the mirror and
just put makeup on and then it's like
I'll usually do it right before bed so
I'll just play and put makeup on and
then just take it off because it's time
for bed but sums up if you are the same
way
so I like this and I like to form you
know that the shade is just a little bit
is for me now when they came out with
Mars I was like finally because I love
the formula but this is a way more
wearable shade it's more peachy tone but
it still has that holographic kind of
scent to if you can tell that's still
the supernova it's right there kind of a
peachy shade and it's just so pretty
it's so pretty this is like one of my
favorites of theirs clearly and so if
you're into a more wearable holographic
then you will love this definitely
definitely love it and like I said these
are all $28 that's pretty expensive for
a highlighter you can totally get
cheaper versions but if you are like
dying to try some I would totally
recommend Mars one so the next thing I
wanted to talk about is another new one
for them a new skincare stick and it's
their matcha cleanser this is $26 and on
this before website is sulfate free soap
purifies exfoliates and targets redness
so through your skin asalaam is matcha
cleanser infused with antioxidant past
matcha green-tea the solid cleanser
detoxifies exfoliates
matcha and lavender essential water
helps soothe and calm irritated skin
while algae extract helps boost skin's
natural defenses instant hydration skin
is left feeling clean soft and smooth
and again it's TSA friendly so this is
one that I double cleanse as it is I
always use like a cleansing balm to get
my makeup off and I rinse that off then
I go in with the cleanser just to really
make sure everything's off so I like to
use a more hydrating cleanser so this
made me feel nervous because I was like
okay it's a stick there are little tiny
exfoliating I don't want to say beads
it's smaller than that but there are
little like granules in here and it made
me nervous cuz I'm like so what do I do
like I just put it all over my face and
then give water so I'm going to read
their how to use this is after removing
makeup so you do want to because I was
like this is not going to be a makeup
remover kind of thing gently massage
salt stick onto damp skin in a circular
motion
put it down lather with fingertips and
rinse Oh I've used this maybe three or
four times I haven't noticed my skin
break out so that's big because you know
if some cleansers you're like you it
didn't break my skin out I haven't
noticed like my skin's like crazy better
than normal but I feel like my skin's
kind of in a good spot anyway and it
hasn't messed that up so that's a good
thing so for me before I would travel
with this and if you're thinking about
like Oh a solid cleanser that's going to
be great definitely buy it and try it
out for a few weeks make sure your skin
reacts okay to it and that's just good
advice across-the-board before you
travel you don't want to take a skincare
products with you or make a product with
you that you've never tried or you
haven't tried very long because there's
a chance that could break you out and
then you're on vacation taking pictures
and you're all broken out and that would
be terrible so I want to try some more
before I decide if I'm going to take it
or not but I have to I mean it made my
skin feel nice this next product is
really cool this is their hydrating oil
stick it's $24 and it is exactly what it
sounds like it is a stick form of oil it
is very hydrating I put it on last night
and my husband was like you've a mask on
I'm like no it's it's just this oil
and I always put on like serums and all
kinds of things like that but this is
one of the first times he's ever said so
I do feel like it's super oily but if
you're putting it on right before bed it
just sinks in and this morning I woke up
and I was like yes like your skin looks
actually really nice and I've been in
the Sun I've been wearing SPF but I
always feel like my skin gets them
dehydrated and I felt like my skin
looked so hydrated this morning and I've
used this I would say maybe six or seven
times and and I've been using this off
and on for a few weeks now and I really
do like it again I wouldn't use it like
in the morning before putting on makeup
I don't think that's its intended use
anyway but I was very impressed that
something in a thick could be so
hydrating so let's read what they say
about it says it's a lightweight formula
I wouldn't say like it's not thick by
anything so I guess in that way it is
lightweight but it is oily infused with
apricot avocado calendula jojoba and
orange peel oils it absorbs quickly into
skin but I don't want it it says you
could use on your body as well so I
guess you know elbow is whatever but I
really did like it one of those things
that I think if I ran out I would
probably buy again just because it's
such a I mean when I'm parched
it's like perfect so the last milk
product I wanted to mention were their
eye pigments they send me their entire
line I've kind of gone through and I've
only kept the shades I genuinely use
what I think milk has been really good
about is as they're creating these new
products they're making sure they're
good before they go out I feel like so
many companies they're like the new
launched and they just like launched a
huge line of stuff and like having this
good and have this crappy I'm like
wouldn't it be better to just launch the
stuff that's good and just scrap the
stuff that I mean I don't know I don't
know how any that works but I'm always
like when I try bad product and like
what how did this get through but
everything I've tried of milks has been
really good so I feel like they're
really thoughtful and they take their
time with their products and their
launches which should never company do
that anyway so their eyes payments are
twenty four dollars and in oh my gosh
where did you go five seven eight nine
ten looks like eleven or twelve shades
all of them are amazing there is not a
single one in the bunch having swatch
all of the numerous I'm having
used many of them none of them are bad
they are all equally great you just got
to find a shade you like do I think you
need like four or five shades no final
ones you know you're going to use for me
that's like the rose gold and bronze V
shade so I love after-party
I love gig I've talked about these a lot
hotel lobby is like a nice light gold
they have some Silver's and some darker
colors they have a purple and a green a
blue so whatever you want you can use as
an eye base you can use it just a lone
that's usually how I wear it just
because it's so pretty on its own I'll
just put it onto my lid with my finger
then I'll grab a brush to kind of blend
it into the crease and that is it and I
get so many compliments because it just
catches the light so beautifully it's
not glittery at all it's just shimmery
and I just love them and this is the
kind of product that's going to last me
forever I'm never going to run out of
this if you've tried some milk milk if
you tried some milk makeup products that
you've loved or you've hated please let
us all know down below as I was
scrolling through like Sephora website
and seeing what they sell from milk
makeup I was like oh my gosh there's way
more than I knew I'd like I kind of
thought it was like you know a bunch of
some stick some eye stuff but they sell
a lot of stuff and then when I looked on
the milk website of course the websites
just like really cool looking very
trendy but I'm just so impressed there's
so many things like they have their cool
water stick I'm dying to try they have
they have a lip and cheek stick I would
love to try there's so much stuff that
they sell which is so cool and I'm like
Lulu but let me know down below what is
worth trying lettuce all notes we can
all learn together if you have another
brand that you are curious about maybe
me doing one of those what's behind the
packaging kind of a video please let me
know down below I would love to do that
