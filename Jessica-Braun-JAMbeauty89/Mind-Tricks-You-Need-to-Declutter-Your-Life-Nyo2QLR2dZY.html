cluttering tip video and this is meant
to inspire you guys to declutter like
crazy this year I have started doing it
and I have never felt better and I don't
just mean decluttering my makeup
collection which I've done some vlogs on
recently but decluttering my closet I
had so many clothes that I never wore
and I have I need I need to declutter
all of my books like books that I've
read that I'm probably never going to
read again and if I ever wanted to read
again I can just get it from the library
you know things that unless they have
sentimental value to me if I'm not using
them pass them on because someone else
can use them and love them so I have a
list of a ton of tips that I typed out
because I filmed this before and I was
just all over the place because I
there's just so much that goes into
getting you into that declutter mindset
that I felt like I should organize it a
little better so tip number one get rid
of your what if products and by that I
mean if you're keeping a product or a
clothing item or a kitchen utensil
whatever it is because you're in the
mindset well what if I need this in the
future what if I want to use this for a
Halloween costume or what if I need this
black lipstick for a Halloween costume
whatever it is if there what if products
get rid of them odds are you'll never
ever end up needing it even if you need
it once it's taking up space that's
something that you know you can get for
a dollar ninety-nine if you need it for
Halloween from wet-and-wild or you know
you can go to Goodwill and get that
Halloween costume piece for really cheap
when you need it keeping things just in
case usually you just don't ever need it
plus things eventually go bad so if
you're just keeping it it's just taking
up space and then eventually you have to
throw it out anyway tip number two don't
buy backups now sometimes there are
products that you fall in love with and
you're like oh my gosh to just say oh
I'm going to go buy three of them
because it's a really good sale and then
buy the like second time you the second
bottle of it you're tired of it that's
what's happened to me I get tired of and
then I'm like I have all these backups
of this and I'm never going to use it
why did I
by so many of these and then I end up
getting rid of them anyway because I
don't want them things go bad if you buy
a ton of one item and then eventually
they go bad but you buy them because
they're on sale or they're on clearance
they went back you didn't get to use it
anyway you wasted your money you waste
space I mean there's just so many things
so I have tried to not buy backups
unless it's a situation where I know
that I've used this product for years
and I love it and I won't get tired of
it in it's worth it you know what I mean
so just be smart about that tip number
three if you have more than one of
something you need just get rid of all
of them but your favorite for example I
had five iPad cases five I can only use
one at a time and usually once I'd use
one and I switch to another I don't
really want to go back to the other I'm
kind of tired of it and most of the time
I gotten really cheap online or they
were sent to me or they were five
dollars on clearance whatever it was but
I had five and at the time I wasn't
using any of them so I went through
picked out my favorite and got rid of
the rest and it was the easiest I feel
good I'm like it was taking up this much
space in this chest I have right over
here for no reason I was never going to
use them again and we're having the
garage sale soon so I'm going to sell
them there and that's going to be that
in addition to that under that same
umbrella is if you have seven pink lip
glosses that are all exactly the same
color get rid of all of them but your
favorite there's no reason to have
unless you're keeping them now I'm a
beauty vlogger you know so sometimes
I'll keep more than one shade for
reference but even that I'm trying not
to keep anything just for reference
because really if I needed a reference
it I can look it up online there are
pictures and videos of every product
Under the Sun online that I don't need
to keep it for it to go bad I'd rather
get rid of it while I haven't used it
while it's new whatever and give it to
his sister give it to someone I know
that will like it instead of having ten
pink lip glosses in my drawer and I'm
only using the one that I really love so
I'm getting rid of the other nine
keeping the one I love it just feels
great and then when I look at my lip
glosses I only have a few to choose from
I'm just thinking hmm pink peach or you
know clear whatever I want I don't have
to think okay if I want paint do I want
this one this one this one this
so I mean it's overwhelming I can't
handle it so it just feels good okay tip
number four just because it was
expensive doesn't mean it's worth
keeping there are so many products that
I spent a lot of money on and it was
like I kept it for too long so I
couldn't return it or you know whatever
the scenario is I still have it but I
maybe used it once or twice I realize
it's not good for my skin tone or my
skin type or I just don't like it
I don't find myself reaching for it
whatever the reason is I'm holding on to
it because I'm like well I spent $30 on
this or $40 on this palette so what if
you're not using it you're not using it
why not either sell it online or
somewhere or get rid of it so someone
else can love it because either way
whether you get rid of it or you keep it
you're not using it either way so would
you miss it nope in like a month later
once it's gone you won't even remember
that you had it that's kind of my
biggest thing I'm like I won't even care
that I don't have it because I'm never
using it anyway so just get rid of it
and that's hard to do and I know it is
because for us I know a lot of you guys
that watch we all put a lot of research
into products that we're buying
especially when it is more expensive so
when it doesn't work it's like pan but
even if it's a cult classic but you
don't like it just get rid of it there's
no point in keeping it just because
everyone else says it's good if you
don't like it you know tip number five
take care of your items if it is
something you love and it's something
you're actually keeping take care of it
for example my iPad case that I love the
most gets dirty really easily so the
other day when I went through them and I
was like I'm gonna keep this one but
it's really dirty I'm like you know what
I'm gonna take the time to like I
literally got a toothbrush and some
cleaner and I cleaned the iPad case and
it looks as good as new and the reason I
stopped using it earlier was because it
was kind of dirty and like why not
actually take care of the things I own
I'm Terra that might sound so silly to
some of you but to the other few that
maybe you know what I mean I'm trying to
be better about really taking care of my
items if a button pops off of a shirt
that I love sew it back on you don't
have to just get rid of it cuz man you
don't wanna take time to take the time
it's one you love so I literally have a
pile of things I pulled out of my closet
that either I need to tighten the button
on that I'm scared it's going to pop off
or you know a button ripped off I need
to sew it back on
etc
I'm gonna take the time to do it because
they're all clothes that I love that I
don't want to get rid of just because
I'm lazy okay tip number six if you
haven't won in a year get rid of it
just get rid of it whether that's makeup
jewelry clothing items kitchen utensils
if you haven't used it in a year get rid
of it
odds are if within a year span through
all the season you haven't used it
you're probably never going to use it
unless it's a special occasion in which
case you know different maybe having a
formal gown and you don't use it but
other than that you know if you really
needed it in the moment you can go out
and buy it then but right now it's just
taking up space there is a trick for
that in your closet you can turn your
clothes a certain way on the hanger like
have your hangers turned around and then
as you use them wash them and rehang
them up turn them around so that way by
the end of the year or however long you
want this to last you can see if they're
still facing that original way you
didn't wear it that means get rid of it
you can also do that with like little
post-it note flags on your jewelry items
or your makeup or your kitchen whatever
you want to do put something on them and
as you use them take it off and then at
the end of however long of a time span
you want to put then if it still has the
post-it note or the rubber band whatever
you use you'll see that hmm I am NOT
using this I should get rid of it here
are a few shopping tricks when it comes
to decluttering because the problem with
decluttering is we have to if we're
going to declutter the stuff that we
already have we have to be smarter about
the stuff that we're buying at the store
because that's how it all starts anyway
right so one of my biggest tips that has
taken me forever to learn is if it's if
you've got a shirt in your hand or
whatever it is and it's kind of a maybe
in your mind just don't get it you
should only be buying things that are
100 percent things you totally want or
need you know like for the biggest
problem I have and I'm sure I'm not the
only one is I'll see something on
clearance at Target for example and I'm
like wow these jeans are only eight
dollars what a great deal for jeans
which it is a good deal cuz really a
goodwill jeans are still like six or
seven bucks which is crazy anyway so I'm
like wow that's a really good deal on
jeans but then I'll get them because
they fit okay but I'm
I put it's such a good deal so I'll buy
him I'll wear him like once or twice I
won't like the way they fit and then
I'll get rid of them in the next year in
a garage sale or wherever I just wasted
eight dollars that I could have taken
that and other money that I spent on
clearance items that I didn't totally
love and put all of that towards one
really nice pair of jeans or one really
nice blazer whatever it is so you've got
to be smarter about what you're buying
if you're just kind of like oh then
don't get it just only buy the things
that you're like oh my gosh I totally
totally in love with this I know I'll
wear for a long time you know be honest
with yourself when it comes to that ask
yourself this question well I wish that
I purchased this item a month from now
well I look back and think I should have
bought that shirt I should have bought
that lipgloss if you can honestly
honestly answer the question and say I'm
really not even going to remember this
in a month then just don't get it
it sounds kind of silly but it really
works I caught myself asking myself that
and it really helps I put back so many
different especially jewelry items or
shirts that I'm like I'm not gonna be
thinking about this plain v-neck tee in
a month just because it's four dollars
doesn't mean I need to get it I have a
million plain v-neck tees I'm wearing
well it's not plain but a v-neck tee
from Target right now that I love I
don't need a million more just because
it is a clearance item that's such a
crazy deal a one dollar lipstick or two
dollar eyeshadow it doesn't mean you
need to have it just because it's cheap
doesn't mean that you would be stupid to
pass it up frankly you'd be stupid to
buy it if it's not something you need
because it's just gonna be another thing
that's in your collection that you're
probably not going to use now for the
time there's a reason it's clearance
then no that's not always true you know
there are certain items that I love that
I did get on clearance but there are a
lot of clearance items that I've box
those have both two dollars I'll just
buy it maybe I'll review for my channel
or I'll just have it as reference
I either never used it or I use it once
and just never reach for it again I mean
you know how that goes so unless it's
something you're going to use or you
need just skip it even though it's just
a dollar just skip it force yourself to
say I don't need this be willing to
splurge on the staple items for your
closet or makeup bag
whatever it will always be worth it to
spend a little bit more money on
something that's going to last longer
that's higher quality that is something
you genuinely will use all the time then
spending it on a bunch of little things
that in the end you probably won't keep
longer than a year too for example I had
a black blazer in my hand recently that
was it was like 45 dive I was like that
is a lot for a blazer I don't want to
spend that on anything let alone a
blazer but then I thought I'll wear it
all the time it's gonna be a staple and
I I do wear it all the time but I had in
my hand and I also had like three maybe
even four different items that were on
sale that were all really really cute
like two cute shirts a cute skirt and
then like I don't remember what the
other one was but they were all pretty
cheap and they all added up to that same
price and I was like why I could get
both I'm like no that's like $80 total
like well I could get these four items
for $40 or I can get this for $45 I
ended up I'm so proud of myself I ended
up putting back the sale items in
getting the Blazer
and I wear that blazer more than I would
ever wear any of those four items and
while sometimes it really is hard to
splurge and of course you have to be
smart with yourself do you have the
money to do that you know but I'm so
glad that I made that decision because I
thought wow that is something that I am
just promised proud of Bonnie because
I'm like it's something I'll wear all
the time whereas there's other things
it's just more little shirts that I have
that I'll probably wear a couple times
you know so it's it's always word worth
splurging on items who use a lot that
being said you want to be smart about if
it's kind of a fashion fad like maybe
it's a crop top or high-waisted shorts
and you're like I'll probably wear it in
the summer maybe this summer maybe next
and then probably not again because
it'll be out of fashion or whatever then
don't spend a lot of money on it I'm
trying to be smarter about if it's kind
of a fad that I'm like oh that's fine
I'll wear that this summer like a crop
top or some sort of dress or something
I'll spend a lot less on it and get a
cheaper maybe not as good quality
version of it
because I know that I'll probably be
getting rid of it in a year or two
whereas I'll spend more on something
that I know will it's kind of fad proof
you know so all of those ten tips
overall just be smart and honest with
yourself when you're shopping and when
you're going through your stuff at home
basically just be smart about your
purchases be smart about what you're
bringing home because you don't want to
face that same item six months later and
be asking yourself should I get rid of
this I just bought it but I don't wear
it you don't want to even bring items
like that home if you've started
decluttering then be smart from here on
out be honest with yourself about why
you're buying an item are you buying it
just because it's cheap are you buying
it because it's a fad but you don't even
really like it are you buying it because
you just want it right in that moment
because you're emotional shopping you
know and that happens to all of us but
be honest with yourself if you think
about those questions and you're like
you know what I am just emotional
shopping or you know what I am just
buying it because it's an eight dollar
pair of jeans but I don't really need it
/ I don't love the way it fits then put
them back be honest with yourself also
about the stuff that you're hanging on
to and this is the hardest thing and
I've watched those show hoarders and
most of the time the hardest part is
just the getting rid of part because you
form emotional attachments or you ask
yourself well what if I need that be
honest with why you're trying to hold on
to it if you're trying to hold on to it
because it's an emotional thing like
someone gave it to you like a family
member that might be different that
might be worth keeping but if you're
keeping it just because you're like well
I spent a lot of money on it but you're
not wearing it get rid of it you know
all of those tips just be smart and
honest with yourself I promise you're
going to feel so much better after you
go through it I'm looking right here at
a box filled with makeup that I'm
getting rid of in a trash bag filled
with clothes that I'm getting rid of and
then on top of that you just feel good I
feel like like all my drawers I cleaned
out I can breathe I got rid of things
that I've had for years that I always
face I always face and think maybe I
should get rid of it and I always keep
it
I finally all those things that I said
maybe I'll get rid of it but I don't
want to and I kept I finally got rid of
all of them my closet feels replenished
in like revived it's so cool and it's
not overwhelming anymore to pick out
because I know that everything in my
closet I love there's not a thing in
there that I'm like no wear it if it's
laundry day you know what I mean no I
got rid of them all because I never
faced that day where I ran out of things
to wear you know so I really hope this
was helpful I know I was super wordy and
I'll have this list of rules down below
as well if you want to keep them and put
them out and use them when you're
decluttering because I'm telling you
there are so many inspiring videos here
on YouTube that have helped me kind of
develop my mantra when it comes to
decluttering and being smart about
shopping but I hope this was helpful for
you guys and I'll catch you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
