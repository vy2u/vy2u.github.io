have a product empties video or products
that I've used up and so this is
basically going to be a video full of
reviews of a ton of products that over
the past few months really that I
finished using which means I've used
them enough to really form an opinion on
them so that's what this is all about so
I have a lot of skincare facial stuff
makeup things like that hair care as
well so let's dive right in one thing
that I there are a few products that I'm
I'll probably finish up within the next
like two weeks so I figure I'll show it
now since I really only film these
videos like one to two times a year I
would bet cuz I don't go through
products that quickly because I have so
many to try out and use so one that I
have almost used up is the maybelline
instant age rewind concealer and this
one is in the shade light and I really
like these I also have let me dig it out
of this little box of empties I've got
here I also have completely used up the
same exact product but sit but it's in
the brightener shade so this one the
brightener is more of a pink tone and
this one is more of a skin tone I love
this both I use the brightener up a long
time ago because I loved it the most so
if I were to repurchase one of these it
would be the brightener shade because if
you really want a really nice bright
look you can use a regular concealer and
then once you blended that in you can
use the brightener kind of over it like
right in this region and blend that in
and it just is a really nice kind of
almost glowy effect without looking
shimmery or anything like that just
because it's a lighter shade than your
own skin tone I love the brightener I
like the concealer but I don't think
I'll be repurchasing it just because I
have others that if I'm just concealing
I have others that I like better so
another thing that I've just about used
up is the my Jessica change product on
the L'Oreal balm and I have it in the
shade Rose elixir and I only have like
that much left
and it's really I'll just put it on on
top of the lipstick I'm wearing because
that's a lot of the times you can use it
alone it's kind of a sheer wash of color
there's a little bit I have some
lipstick on there right now but here we
go if you can kind of see it it's kind
of just a sheer wash this one's kind of
rose-color hence the name rose elixir
and i just like them I don't know if
I'll repurchase it or not because I
really do like these but I mean there's
so many lip balms out there and I think
in the grand scheme of things it's not
like a crazy amazing product it does
have a little bit of SPF SPF of 15 so
it's nice if you're just looking to try
new balm give this one a try it's nice
but it's not my favorite and it kind of
has like a weird taste so if you
accidentally taste it a little bit it's
a little bit odd um so another product I
just recently used up I just started
going through I have a lot of
travel-sized toiletries and so I'm going
through all the lotions right now
because I was just about to buy a new
lotion cuz I used well I guess I can
just show you
I used this suave lavender vanilla my
sister actually got me this she got all
of us I have a lot of sisters she got
all of us one of these and a few other
things just like in this like goodie bag
last Christmas and I used it up finally
and I liked it a lot and it's pretty
inexpensive for a lotion it lasted a
while and the lavender vanilla scent is
nice because it's not too strong so it
won't combat with perfumes you might be
wearing or anything like that so I like
that about that but once I use this up I
was like gosh I need to go buy more
lotion and then I realized I had tons of
little travel-size so last week or a
couple weeks ago I just started going
through these and so I'm gonna be
working my way through this one is the
Peter Thomas Roth a mega rich body
lotion this was really nice and I don't
know how I'm betting the full sizes
really expensive but this was such a
really nice feel and it my skin really
did feel hydrated all day of course
since I was using this from head to toe
I went through this probably in like
less than a week I mean maybe four uses
but it's really really nice so if you're
wanting to spend some more money on a
nice lotion this would be a good one
it's nice but I don't think I would
spend that much money on lotion I just
can't I can't even wrap my brain around
that so I don't know but I really did
like it I used up my ELF daily brush
cleanser I think I'm gonna keep this
instead of recycling and I think I'm
gonna keep it and maybe do like a DIY
make your own brush cleanser I use a lot
of times I'll use I have a spray bottle
from the dollar store that I'll use
like alcohol into spot-clean brushes but
that can be really harsh on your brushes
so I don't want to use that all the time
so I think I might do like a DIY make
your own spot cleaning brush cleanser so
I might use this to house that DIY we'll
see we'll see we'll see I don't know I
always have these ideas that they never
come to fruition because I just get
visiting okay another thing I've used up
is the Maybelline clean Express makeup
remover I liked it I mean it's really
just it's just as good as any other one
I've tried it's the kind you have to
shake because it has the oil that
separates from it so it's nice it's
around five dollars I like that it was
pink that's really why I bought it
and I think I to keep on at the time I'm
sure but um no it removes waterproof
mascara it's good if you're looking for
a new one it's not bad especially if you
can get a good deal on it another one I
used up is this organics Moroccan argan
oil and right now I'm using a L'Oreal
one and it doesn't even compare this
stuff is so much better and I'm gonna
use it all the way up but this this is
around the same price there's like a
hair on it sorry gross my boyfriend gets
so grossed out by like one stray hair
like summer I'm like you're gonna need
to get over it because if we were ever
to get married you got to get used to
that cuz IV girls hair it comes out you
might have one hair like you know
sitting on the bed or something
excellent he freaks out is hilarious
anyway um I should do some sort of like
trick on like April Fool's Day with like
hair to him would be so mean it's so
funny anyway sorry uh-huh I really
really like this stuff this is the
penetrating oil I think they have one
that's like extra penetrating I think
but I like just the regular penetrating
Wow um I like it a lot and I really
think I'm gonna repurchase it after I
finish up the Viloria one I'm using so I
used up a couple mascaras this is the
Lancome Hypnose star which I fell in
love with when I first opened it I
really didn't like it and of course this
is just the trial size but the brush is
so odd um I loved it I loved the shape
of it and how it kind of fit I used the
you know thicker cup
part of the Komen if you will on the
outside and the thinner part on the
inside and then you could use the thin
part for your bottom lashes and I love
to this stuff and my lashes were so long
when I used it but again you know it's
almost a $20 mascara I don't think I'm
gonna be spending that anytime soon on a
mascara another mascara used up is the
Smashbox hyper lash mascara and this is
another trial size now this one is a
rubbery brush I know it's probably not
going to focus but it's just a rubbery
brush it's nice at getting in and like
separating your lashes but beyond that I
didn't really like it I mean I could use
this on top of another volumizing
mascara just to kind of get through the
clumps but I have the clump crusher now
that does the same thing and this is
much more expensive so this was one that
I ended up just leaving in my purse just
like if I needed touch-ups or just
mascara or whatever I would have this
but I didn't use it really on it
everyday basis at all I used up an elf
eyelid primer I love these I go through
them I have another one already open cuz
I love them they're a dollar someone
said that they couldn't find the dollar
version though on their website anymore
so I haven't checked that out but they
said they found them for three dollars
even if it were three dollars it's still
a really really good deal in that lasts
a pretty long time so I used another
eyeshadow primer potion the Urban Decay
another trial sized one it's okay I
think really they do the same job they
really do get the cheaper one if you're
debating because it does the same job
really two liners that I've just about
used up I am going to continue to use
these but they'll be gone before we know
it this one is the Smashbox limitless
eyeliner it's in onyx which is just a
black and then I also have a NYX lied on
pencil I guess I could swatch them I'm
just gonna see this is the Smashbox onyx
and this is the NYX light on pencil
they're both I mean I only swiped once
they're both really black the NYX slide
on ones are similar to the Jordana ones
which I reviewed recently in a video
I adore and they're also similar to the
Urban Decay 24/7 pencils but they're a
lot cheaper so the NYX I don't ones I
really recommend especially the colored
ones I like the smashed up when it's not
as creamy but I kind of like that for
tightlining and I know it sounds weird
because most people you'd want creamier
but sometimes the smashbox one allows
for a little bit more control so i I
really like both again you know the
symmetric ones a little pricey I think I
got it just in a kit that's the only
reason I had it so I liked it though
another thing that's just about used ups
is this Revlon Colorstay for normal to
dry skin I used to use the other kind
the what is it combo oily skin and then
I started using normal to dry and it's
just a little bit more moisturizing and
I little fell back in love with it I
already have a backup so this one's
almost gone I traveled with it and the
lid was a little bit cracked and you'll
see in my travel video I might upload
that before after this one I'm not sure
but you'll see in that makeup bag video
that it was there was a little crack and
there's a little bit in it now I mean
look it's crazy but it's not coming out
it's very odd it's like trapped in the
lid but it's almost gone and I'm glad
for that because it's just falling apart
but I love this and I will be probably
right after this is done opening my
backup of it because it's my favorite
okay so more things I've used up these
these are my favorite makeup wipes did
the FBL green tea cleansing tissues
they're sold at Big Lots you can get
them online as well but at Big Lots are
only a dollar for a pack of 30 a dollar
a dollar what a freaking steal you look
like I all even spending five or six
dollars I'm like the Target brand wow
that's so much money on this when I know
I love these no only a dollar so I've
gone through quite a few I'm sure I've
gone through even more I just I was like
do I really need to keep all of these
but each month of course they use one up
I also tried the same brand but the
citrus I didn't like them they weren't
and this could have just been this pack
but they weren't as moist these I've
never had an issue with them getting
dried out or anything like that now they
do sell a pack of 60 for two dollars so
it's the same deal and it has this just
has like the sticky opening you know
that'll just you know adhere the other
kind is the kind
it's almost like a baby wipe one that
like snaps open and shut and those I do
notice getting dried out towards the
last like 20 so and I'm actually using
one of those right now because I figured
I'd give that big pack another chance
they're they're already dry so I like
the just the packs of 30 they stay moist
I love this brand they're so cheap if
Big Lots ever stop selling them I don't
know what I would do because I can't
bring myself to spend $5 on a package
makeup wipes that are just literally
getting thrown away I can't even know
they'd be terrible anyway I think if I
ever found that I would just buy as many
as I could at Big Lots like just buy a
box be set for a couple years anyway cuz
that people Emma do some math for you
folks listen to this if I finally go
through one of these a month which is
about right there's 30 and I use one a
day that would be $1.00 per thing that's
$12 in a year that I've spent on makeup
remover wipes if I spent even we'll just
say even four dollars on a pack of 30
you know and that's kind of on the
cheaper side of you know Neutrogena
whenever even just $4 that's $48 on
makeup remover wipes versus 12 who is
five that's $60 a year versus $12 a year
you guys know that I'm all about saving
money and this is a great way to save a
nice chunk of money okay I also have
gone through a Jergens natural glow this
is the kind and is actually getting
older and I have a few of these older
ones that I haven't used up yet and they
still have that smell and now the ones
that they put out now don't have they
say they're unscented they still have a
scent but it's not nearly as bad as it
used to be and this is one this is
actually the firming kind I don't think
I ever notice any like firming
differences although I don't have many
issues with that yet I say yet cuz I'm
young I mean I figure it's to come but
anyway um but the smell it just kills me
I might just throw out the couple that I
left they're all kind of almost gone I
don't know how to happen but it did and
so I might throw them out because the
smell is just so unbearable for me now
it's getting on my hand but I haven't
used natural glow in quite a while this
I used up a couple months ago so another
thing I've used up is the Walmart brand
it's equate the strengthening nail
polish remover I always end up getting
the ones that are perp
cuz I noticed that usually the purple
was no matter what brand it is is
strengthening and my nails need as much
strength as they can get so I liked it
it worked as well as any you know when
it was probably a dollar - this is the
isopropyl alcohol 91% I used this for
spot cleaning brushes like I talked
about although I do want to use one
that's maybe a little less harsh so
we'll see they of course sell 70% as
well but yeah and of course most people
use this as an antiseptic which I guess
that is what I'm using it for for the
brushes but you know what I mean last
thing that I've used up of what I've
actually saved I'm sure there's things I
actually threw out and didn't even
realize is that Johnsons baby
head-to-toe wash I use this as my face
wash everyday I've been using it for
months and my skin has never been better
really it's just amazing and every once
a while if I feel like I need maybe
something a little stronger I'll use I
have a Pilate one that I really really
like that has some like you know
scrubbing granules in it but other than
that I have been sticking to this and I
absolutely love it and who knew it's so
simple and it all started when I had a
really bad break out a couple months ago
and I started using this and it just
literally got rid of it and I fell in
love and I thought I'm gonna buy a
humongous one that lasted me months it
was awesome there's like five bucks so
if you're having issues and maybe you
feel like you want to use something just
gentle on your skin try it get a smaller
size and just see how you like it
because I had no idea I would love it as
much as I do but my skin is like it's
finally like all like the same tone and
I don't I used to have hyperpigmentation
I don't have it anymore I just love it
so go figure anyway hopefully that was
helpful hopefully there were some
reviews in there that that helped you
figure out maybe some products you want
to try maybe some products you don't
want to try and that is all I guess I'll
catch you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
