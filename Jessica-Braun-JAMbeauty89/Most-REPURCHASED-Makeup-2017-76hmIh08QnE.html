going to share with you guys
products that I haven't purchased a
billion time these are products that
literally as I look at my little stash I
think I have bought those so many times
and I love them I love them as much as
the first time I used them and I never
feel bad spending money buying them
again because they're ones that like if
I were in the dark and I had to grab any
one of these to use and to use for the
rest of my life I would be like that's
fine because their products I love
enough to keep buying over and over
again this video is a collab with my
friend Cassie shades of Cassie I am I
never do clap like I think I've done it
I can count on one hand how many times
I've done it in the like three years
that I've been on YouTube is it going on
for years I feel like I think it's
because I'm just picky and I I am
thinking about who I subscribe to here
on YouTube because if I get annoyed a
lot with a person I'm like bossy bioship
member and provide Felicia I'm just
really picky and Cassie's someone that I
remember I started watching her before I
think it was before I started my youtube
channel I remember it was really early
on and I just liked her because she's
just like chill I like the way she
explains things and that girl's got a
lot of makeup but I remember she also
did it a clutter for a while and I loved
watching that this was like years ago
I'm going through the history of shades
of Kathy's channel but I got to meet her
for like a blip of a second at the event
the two-faced sweet peach event in LA in
December December and she was so sweet
and she was with Laura from mrs. Lowell
in here on YouTube they were both just
sweet and I could just tell like you
know when you meet someone you can just
tell their aura it's just they're just a
good soul well I did you tell that
honestly about both of them but um I
just love her to death and I love her
channel so definitely check her out I
really think you're going to like her if
you like my style of video because like
I said she's just really chill and easy
to watch and she's always buying new
stuff but she'd do in the same video and
I'm excited actually to see her video
because I'm curious about what she's
repurchased because I bought a lot of
things on her recommendation oh and of
course classic collab style if you're
new
to my channel and you came from her -
what's up I hope that you'll subscribe
ok
alright the first thing I'd repurchase
over and over and over and over and over
again in this it cosmetics tightline
mascara I I already have another one on
back up this is one of these and
currently it is the 3:1 black primer for
your mascara or for your lashes it's
just insanely tiny wand with tiny tiny
baby bristles the idea is that it
totally separates your lashes you could
use this alone like if you coat this on
like three or four times your lashes are
like just like separated and fanned out
curled and black but I always use this
truly as a mascara primer but I like it
because it's not white so there's no
chance of it like showing underneath but
I'll just use it and really really push
my lashes up and separate them and I'll
use it for my lower lash line especially
and all this is like the only thing I
use on my lower lash line because it's
so good for that and then I'll tie on
another mascara one of my favorites is
the it cosmetics superhero it's
unbelievable blew me away
but anyway it's so so good now I do have
a dupe for this and I felt it gosh it
was like a year ago but I'll link that
you're curious about a cheaper version
of this but I still end up going back to
this one a lot because I love it so much
I'm drinking coffee you guys need to
tell me if I start getting a little like
bat mames over here okay so a lipgloss
that I love that I've purchased like
four times is this NYX beige lip gloss
it would like an old classic back in the
day but it does smell like cherry so if
you're sensitive to smell you won't love
this but it's this really pretty pink
but when you put it on your lips there's
something about it that just makes your
lips look so healthy and put together
you don't it doesn't look messy or
sloppy like some lip glosses can
especially lip glosses that do have
color like this it just looks so perfect
the packaging is simple but I love the
little bow on top and it's just a pretty
lip gloss and make sure let's look kind
of pillowy soft and it doesn't really
highlight any imperfections it's a
really good gloss I tried other shades
in that range that I've liked but this
is the one that like I just keep
reviving the same shade have my hair in
a ponytail and it was giving me a
headache
so I doesn't take it down I just saw my
January favourites and floss and I had a
date down my head's pounding
okay this is probably the fifth one of
this I bought this is the Maybelline
Dream Lumi concealer I'm happy
brightening shade and I really like that
as well but I've noticed on my skintone
I actually just too cluttered it in my
concealer declutter which I don't know
if that's up yet or not but I just kind
of realized that that one it is a pinky
tone which is nice on some skins but on
the skin oh my but on mine it just kind
of looked very pink
it didn't really mesh with my warmer
it's skin tone but this one I have an
ivory I think this one's really nice I
have the YSL one that this is supposedly
a dupe for and I think these are pretty
close I do think the actual consistency
this is thicker then the YSL and a
little bit honestly more opaque so I
don't think they're exact dupes but I do
think they're very very similar and the
after effect is very similar where it's
just you know very bright and semi
perfected it's not like a high coverage
concealer but this is one of those that
when I'm in a rush I slap it on I can
blend it in with my fingers and it looks
really nice so I really like that
highly highly recommend I'm filming it
Disney Hall today as well so if you love
Disney like I do so the next one that I
repurchase a lot is this elf exfoliating
lip balm or whatever you want to call it
this is the cherry one they have like a
mint one they have a brown sugar one
when I first tried this like years ago I
hated it because you would rub it all
over your lips and it was kind of
foliate but the next time you want to
use it it'd be like all the lip balm
around it would be gone and so then a
lot of you guys are like Jessica you
idiot just put lip balm on and then use
it no be fine I'm like oh that's pretty
smart well that works for a while but I
feel like they reformulated it since
then and it's got a lot more of that
bony texture so it works really well I
can use it all the way down to the
bottom and it's great it's a couple
dollars you have options like we'd
rather than admit I think I think the
cherry one might be my favorite date I
don't know they keep coming out of new
ones but it's very kind of sugary
feeling it really does a great job just
to get those dead skin skin
off and I always travel with it because
if I'm traveling for we travel all the
time I feel like this is one of those
staples that I have to have with me
because once a week I need it for you
know my lips so love it this one I love
but I go between two different shades
this is the Mac Paint Pot in painterly
and I've almost hit pan on it this is
probably the third one of these I love
it I also like soft ochre I've done a
comparison video like if you are cool
toned versus warm tone well I'm
technically more warm tone if you see me
like in real life and this is a little
bit more cool tone they both totally
work really well and again I can link
that video if you're kind of curious to
see what it actually looks like when you
put it on but it's just this nice almost
concealer like pot but it's an eye
primer and this one almost has like a
grayish moggy tone and I thought it
would be too dark for my skin but it's
not so if you've been not biting the
bullet because you thought it'd be too
dark for you it won't be I don't know
how to describe it but it really does a
great job of canceling out discoloration
on your eyelid all the way up to your
brow bone it holds onto shadow really
well I just love it I just recommended
this to a co-worker actually the other
day and she bought it so hopefully she's
loving it but the soft ochre one is
really nice to it it's more yellow
it might be a tinge lighter but it's
almost hard to compare because they're
totally different tones so you can't
really compare I love them both when I
run out of this one I'm probably going
to use my soft ochre one up because
since this one's older I've been trying
to use it up but eventually I don't know
which one I would buy again because I
like them both so much you all have to
really think about that I think too soft
over one but paint really so good but
like I said if you're trying to decide
between the two check out my video
clearly it didn't help me though because
now here in the future I still can't
decide between t2 alright this Augusta's
via clear brow gel I keep going back to
and I tried a lot of drops or versions I
like them like Milania has a good clear
brow gel with a really small bully but
there's something about this one that is
like hair spray for your brow so
actually I didn't use I used it in a
while because I've been using more like
pomade and I feel like I haven't really
needed it
but because it kind of just naturally
holds a seven place but this stuff is
like hair spray for your brow it's just
it's a league above a lot that I've
tried if you have found a drugstore
version that you think holds as well as
this one does let me know below because
I am curious but the NYX control freak
one is nice that I don't think it's as
strong as this so nice next thing I
repurchase a lot is Maya cosmetics CC
cream I know everyone on YouTube talks
to the desk guys there's a good reason
it took me a long time to finally try
this because it was kind of annoying to
hear everyone talk about what okay it
can't be that gun like some people are
sponsored or maybe to send to them well
I both bought this on my own and had it
sent to me this one I bought because I
loved it so much like I try it now it's
like oh my gosh I get it
it's something that's actually good for
your skin but it also actually is an
amazing foundation call the CC creams
guys it's a foundation I mean it
literally goes on it covers like a
foundation so if you thing like no I
don't want it because it's going to be
like a BB cream where it doesn't really
you know it kind of looks good but it
doesn't know this stuff makes your skin
look flawless so I think the packaging
is really cool it's great for the
product that it's you know you're not
touching it it's got a pump and it's a
squeezy too so you'll actually probably
use it all up and you won't like with a
glass jar oh those make me crazy I love
it
I haven't the shade light which is a
really good match for me they do have
one lighter called fair which is just a
little bit too light and medium it's
definitely too dark I wish they had a
bigger shade range but I do love this
product so much I've tried the
illuminating one and I do like that I
feel like it's a little bit too
illuminating so I usually will mix them
but I want to try it now that it's
winter I don't have an illuminating one
in white I have it in like medium so I
mix it with it but I feel like if I got
it in light I might like it more because
it'd be my shade but I'm sure to see it
just on its own in the winter when I
have dry skin so make sense anyway but
this stuff in the finish by the way it's
got pretty high covered medium-high
coverage and the finish is just a really
nice satin finish it's not super dewy
but it's definitely not mad it's kind of
right in between makes you look lifelike
but perfected okay next when I bought a
million times is this L'Oreal lacquer
line
it's a cream gel liner I'm wearing it
today this is better I was just talking
recently in a video about this Stila
smudge pot and I love the seal a liquid
liner it's one of my favorites and
actually I don't have it but that's
another one I repurchase like ten times
it's the Stila stay all day liquid
eyeliner I love it it's a felt tip
eyeliner so easy to do a wing with very
black I fought in a million times I just
I literally haven't repurchase it yet
but I love it
but this L'Oreal lacquer liner is the
step I do before liquid liner and I
really do a thick line with it it is so
black it doesn't move you can even put
it on if you're not scared to on your
upper waterline and it will stay in
place for a very long time and really
black in that area I guess you can put
it on your lower waterline - I just have
it because it doesn't move I mean it's
really not that different than like a
gel pencil that you might use for that I
love this stuff so much it is one of the
best drugstore products in the world if
you haven't tried it you should
definitely give it a go and it it comes
with a decent brush - OH
as usual this video can be so long I try
to shorten them and it never happens
this is the covergirl super sizer
mascara again doesn't just look silly
and gimmicky well that's when I thought
and then I saw the brush I'm like no
that looks done like it looks like oh
it's kind of rubbery it's got you know
half of it is bristly and half of this
not this stuff is amazing I've talked it
to death so I will talk about it for too
long here but it just really curls your
lashes it's the best at the drugstore I
have found the only thing I think that
trumps it is the it cosmetics superhero
mascara but again that's a pretty penny
and you know mascara gotta replace all
the time it's not like if you spend
money on a palette you get to keep it
for a couple years so honestly this is
the best at the drugstore it just curled
your lashes at separate stems and it
also adds volume when you use the side
that has no bristles so so weirdly
amazing mascara I just wish the
packaging word is silly I know some
people like it I'm not like trying to
offend you but I just think it's good
okay actually it kind of reminds me like
Saved by the Bell like 90s mascara which
I guess I mean the nineties are cool
again alright two more
so this Revlon Colorstay whipped eye
honestly I feel more repurchased this
because I bought so many different
shades because I I don't know I just
have an I feel like you have to replace
it because it's in a jar like that's not
great for product you know you're
getting bacteria in it the life is
getting in it I mean there's so many bad
things about having products in jars you
know and at least with skincare like in
care shouldn't be in a jar either but so
many of my favorite moisturizers are and
I wish they weren't like if I could
change one thing about it because it
doesn't help keep the products table
inside of it the ingredients in it and
of course you're dipping your finger
into it so I wish all of them were in
squeezy 2 but that would be how it would
be if I ran will however this is a
really nice product it gives a very kind
of satin finish to your skin I wore this
on my wedding day and if you're curious
about the wedding day products I use I
can link that below but all of them were
like products I freaking like Liz and
Brees love so I really like this this is
in the shade 200 I'll usually use a
brush with this I don't like the way
this looks with the Beauty Blender
that's not true I feel like I just go
back and forth but I think final verdict
nowadays I like it with a brush because
I want to say I did a demo with a Beauty
Blender and I think it looked okay but
it definitely sheers it out a little bit
but it's got really good coverage you
just got to be able to find your right
shade in it this is like my third one of
these I actually just decluttered it
because I need to replace it because it
goes bad it has SPF in it and so it
actually has an expiration date like the
actual year and month written on it but
I feel like it's just time to replace
but this you can use as an all-over
setting powder if you really want a nice
glow to your skin you could use it just
as like a subtle highlight if you want
it's brightening you could use it to fit
your under eye I mean it is such an
all-in-one product it definitely has a
glimmer to it without using any glitter
it's just this really nice dewy look it
reminds me of my favorite hourglass dim
light powder I'd even talked about these
being sort of dudes for each other
because they have that same effect once
I put this all over my face today
and I feel like it makes my skin look a
little bit more alive than it is
typically and I just love it so the wet
wild one however is way cheaper way more
product and it has SPF which I just
think is cool so those are all the
products that I repurchase a million
time's definitely subscribe if you are
new to my channel I hope you'll check me

social media which is right there on the
