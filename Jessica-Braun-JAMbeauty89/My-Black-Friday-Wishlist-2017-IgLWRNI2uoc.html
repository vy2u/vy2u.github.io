my Black Friday wish list so I kind of
done video similar to this but the point
for this video is I wanted to share
makeup and beauty items that I have my
eye on that I'm hoping go on sale in
some format on Black Friday I'm filming
this early because I wanted to kind of
get this out there and share it with you
guys for me I'm always looking for ways
to not spend full price on items and I'm
sure I'm not alone
especially since items I'm going to
mention today are mostly from Sephora
and Ulta and they're just pricey items
but they're ones that I'm kind of adding
to my wishlist so one thing that I use
to do this is called shop tagger and I'd
actually heard about this for the first
time from aundrea Matt Solano here on
YouTube who I love I'll link her channel
below she had mentioned it and she was
working with them and they contacted me
and I'm like weird I just heard about
you and downloaded you on my own and
started using it and then they contacted
me so I was like let me tinker around
with it a bit so I did know I was like
this really is awesome so I'm really
excited to do this video in
collaboration with shop tagger so you
download shop tagger and drag it into
your kind of bookmarks bar so that way
the button is there and the button is
really important because as you're
shopping on literally like any website
Sephora Ulta Nordstrom Macy's whatever
you can save an item to your shop tagger
lists so for me I've created this wish
list list and so if I find a makeup item
that I'm really loving and really
wanting for the future but I may be
waiting for it to be on sale that's
something that I'm gonna click that
shout tagger button when that item has
any price change I can be alerted from
shop tagger so that way I know like hey
it's on sale on Sephora right now so I
get that alert I know and that would be
the time that I pull the trigger and
actually buy the product so I think
that's really cool it's also a great way
to save a bunch of items from different
websites all together on one list for me
I used to like keep it in one of my
notes apps you know just have a list but
they're all from different stores and of
course it's not interactive so I'm not
going to see if there's a price change
another thing I really like about it is
that they have a an alert if something's
out of stock they will alert you the
second it's in stock and you can use
that for any website which i think is
really neat because for me there's this
eyelash curler I'm dying to try and it's
always out of stock and I
saved it on here and so I'm waiting for
them to alert me that it's back in stock
because I'm so excited to finally buy
those that eyelash curler I've heard it
so amazing so if you are interested in
shop tagger definitely click my link
below down in the description box to
download it it's completely free to use
I really really like it I think you guys
will too so let's go ahead and get into
my wishlist items so you already saw
some of them that Sarat beauty relevé
lash curler I'm dying to try it's $30
which i think is really expensive but I
also think that I have heard like
amazing amazing things about it and I
have liked lash curlers through the
years but I still don't feel like I
found the one that I'm like oh my gosh
it's so amazing and lash curlers really
do make a difference for my lashes and
so I'm just kind of intrigued to try
that the next thing on my wish list is a
limited edition item and it's the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills Prizm palette I
want to try it because I didn't buy the
subculture palette and you know of
course there's all that controversy over
is is it terrible is it great it's just
a pressed pigment that's super out you
know whatever so I never end up buying
that but the prison palette I've seen
some swatches and I just feel like it
looks like something different than what
I already have and I don't know I just
looking at it I feel like it would kind
of force me to branch out which I know
that I need to do like for my own sake
on my youtube channel I need to branch
out i'll branch out with lips but I'm
Way less likely to branch out with my
eyes and I think that's just such a cool
palette
the downside is that's something that I
feel like even if I love it eventually
you guys won't be able to get it and so
that's another thing that with limited
edition stuff I'm always a little bit
leery about buying just in case I love
it because then you guys can't get it
back something this is from Ulta that I
have my eye on it's the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills Minnie liquid lipstick set
I've never tried any of the anastacio
liquid lipsticks isn't that crazy
i've swatched them in stores like once
or twice I've never bought them and my
thing isn't like a hat it's like 20
dollars over there but this set is 25
for 3 and they're small I've never used
up a liquid lipstick so I feel like
that'd be a good option for me and they
just look like three colors that I'd
really like alright the next thing that
I have
I on repurchasing and I'm hoping it goes
on sale somehow is the chanel Coco
Mademoiselle perfume it's my favorite
perfume I've ever worn and they've kind
of redone the bottle it looks like and
it's so pretty
it smells so sweet but still kind of
grown-up like it doesn't smell so sweet
and like juvenile now that there's
anything wrong with that but I just kind
of feel like I've outgrown that this
smells sweet feminine but like a grown
woman as well and I just oh my gosh I
love it if you haven't set smelled it in
store you have got to okay here's
something this is like a true wishlist
item it's so expensive it's the freaking
Sunday Riley what is it called good
jeans all in one lactic acid treatment
this stuff is apparently a magical
potion to everyone that's tried it
however it is a hundred and fifty eight
dollars I don't think I've ever ever
spend $150 on anything anything okay
that's ridiculous I mean obviously there
are certain things in life but like
skincare makeup no I never have I don't
know that I could ever do it I like even
if I were like a freaking millionaire I
just don't know how people can do it
it's so much money how do you like lose
touch that that's not a lot of money for
like something that either is gonna go
bad in a year or you're gonna use up
like I don't know anyway I would love to
try it but it is so freakin expensive so
if it went on sale like a crazy sale
that'd be awesome but I don't know other
things I wish would be on sale for like
a Black Friday I'm dying to try the
Lancome tante a doll or 10t doll idol
their foundation stick I really like
their foundation but I've heard the
foundation stick is really creamy it
just spreads right over I love and
actually what I'm wearing today is the
hourglass vanish foundation say I love
that stuff best foundations think I've
ever tried but I'm so intrigued by this
one too because I've heard it's really
good and their shade range is ridiculous
it's awesome so that's one I'm like
hoping it's $42 regular price so I'm
really hoping it goes on sale I want to
get some new beauty wonders so that's
kind of on my list and I figured there's
a chance that beauty blenders would be
on some kind of a sale either at Ulta
Sephora somewhere on Black Friday so I
really got my eyes on the Beauty Blender
nude only because like if I've got
foundation all over its not gonna look
completely disgusting
on the other hand then i won't i won't
wash it as much because of that oh it's
totally clean but like you know the pink
ones and stuff they really show so I'm
really kind of drawn towards the nude
colored one or the black one I bought a
black one and Pinocchio chewed it up and
that was like the first new Beauty
Blender I bought in so long but I had to
throw some of mine away because I was
like these are just too old but I need
to get a new one also did the Sephora
favorites boxes ever go on sale for
Black Friday I don't know that they do
but I would love to get any of those at
a discount like they give me more lip is
insane like its $68 regular price but
there are so many lip products in there
and how many of them are like full price
5 not full price five of them are full
size and ten are like deluxe minis and
there's so many that I just haven't
tried like I've never tried Bobby Brown
anasazi Beverly Hills I haven't tried
Dior lip Maximizer never tried the hood
of beauty liquid mattes
like there's so many things in there I
haven't tried them like for me that's
awesome but really for anyone there's
all different kinds of shades and colors
and there's some YSL in there the new
wander Beauty I've not tried anything
from that brand so I just feel like
there's so many cool things that that'd
be a great way to try it even if it
doesn't go on sale that's one that I'm
thinking about buying maybe at some
point during the holidays just be for
the same reason I just mentioned there's
so many things I could try out mmm
really does it's a good deal because
really five of those full price would be
more than $68 okay so now that violet
Voss is sold at Sephora I've not tried
any of their stuff I'm looking at the
Holy Grail palette I don't know if they
would go on sale because they're you
know like so new at Sephora I don't know
but I would love to buy the Holy Grail
palette for cheaper than freaking $45
however like looking at it the colors
are so pretty but of course I know that
I already have palettes that are just
like it like why would I need that but
I'm like but I want to try violet boss I
want to know I don't know and I remember
the Laura Lee one looked amazing too but
and that one's not being sold on Sephora
Oh something that's a really good deal
that it's a good deal as it is but I'm
thinking a lot of times these little
sets will go on sale on Black Friday
it's the Bekaa glow on the go
highlighter set it has a mini of the
they're highlighter in both the liquid
and the powder form I'm assuming it's an
opal
double-check oh they have to they have
opal and they have champagne pop I
haven't tried champagne pop I know
that's crazy so that'd be a great way
for me to try I thought they just had an
opal but they have a champagne pop one
and that might be the way I try it
because I'm like I don't really need
another highlighter but I of course have
heard it's really really good so that's
something that there's a high likelihood
that one might go on sale and I would
love to try that and the liquid
shimmering skin perfector is amazing I
used the one in opal all the time it
just looks so healthy on your skin
another thing that's on my list because
I was in Sephora or no maybe is Ulta
actually and of course they sell it as
for as well she was wearing on her lips
one of the workers and I was like what
are you wearing on your lips and she
showed me it's the Clinique pop matte
lip color in primer the shade she was
wearing was blushing pop which is shade
number one it was the prettiest like
neutral pink I've ever seen it looked so
soft on her lips and she's like I've had
this on for hours and it lasted all day
and so it's 1850 I don't know that those
will go on sale but that's one that I
might just buy anyway but I really
really like it and that there's a chance
though that like that's again just to
bring shop tiger up again but I really
like it because I could save this and I
could save it on a few different
websites to see if any of them have a
price change especially as we get closer
to Black Friday because Clinique is sold
at department stores Ulta support like
tons of different things so I could save
it on a bunch of different sites on the
shop tagger to see if there are any
price changes on that day because while
I don't think they'd be on sale in
Sephora or Ulta really they might be on
sale at a department store so I think
that's one cool way to use it if you
really are kind of trying to play the
field and price gauge at a bunch of
different places
Black Friday can be so stressful at
least for me and I know it's so dumb and
I'm glad that a bunch of stores are like
kind of taking a step back and they're
stopping creeping up on Thanksgiving you
know but it's so stressful because for
me I'm like there's so many sales like
where do I begin and it's like hard to
plan for and it's so this is at least
one way that I feel like okay at least I
know I've got like my eyes on a bunch of
different sites and it's all kind of
collected and it's just really cool and
it's free so those are all the items in
the share with you I feel like I could
talk about like 50 items that I want but
those are kind of the ones that are at
the top of my list that I'm really
really interest
I will link everything that I mentioned
down below and of course definitely if
you're interested in shop tagger click
