25th when I'm filming this and I listen
to Halloween music the entire way here
because I am so excited for fall and
Halloween
I can't even deny it anyway so I am if
you can see that there I am at the
Dollar Tree and so I'm gonna see what I
can find here I've got on my like
shopping list for decor like cute border
my theme this year I don't really have a
real theme like I really don't but I
like like the black chalkboard kind of
stuff and that's what I've done really
for all the this is my fourth year
teaching so all the first three years
I've always kind of done something like
that and like kind of canvas kind of
burlap stuff I think I'm gonna still be
with that theme but I want it to be just
a little bit more colorful I found some
teal border it's really really pretty
more like turquoise what's the
difference I don't even know anyway at
school like a whole huge role so I think
I want to try to use that and we also
have green so maybe like a turquoise and
green theme is that like weird maybe
anyway so I figure I'm gonna look here
see what I can find that's cute and then
I'm gonna go to a teacher store I don't
know if it's like nationwide it's called
United art and education I don't know
where it is but it literally is for
teachers and it's awesome so I'm gonna
see what stuff I can get cheap here and
then go to the other store let's go on I
always buy cough drops because I always
end up meeting me
that's kind of cute I have like an
informational wall I'm wanting to put up
with the date you know stuff like that
so it might be fine fun for the weather
person to do the temperature for the day
okay
these are adorable the best way to
predict the future is to create it but
else be believe there's good in the
world I have something like this already
like a toaster
thank you
I like this one for like social studies
I might use these to write numbers on
for like mailboxes or different things
that I'm planning on having like the
students numbers on that's pretty cool
I'm also going to get a bunch of these
frames with this like glass kind of
plastic stuff so that I can write
learning targets on them this could be
cool to hang them that's awesome I'm
thinking about getting these three
colors of ribbon just in case since
those are kind of the colors I'm going
for in my classroom from maybe your
uncle for this yellow I think I like the
yellow better with it's cute
okay JK about the frames because I found
these dry erase boards that I think like
the 3m strips I could do so I got some
for like homework for each subject and
some for my learning targets okay 90
degrees I'm starting to sweat
and I know some of you guys that live in
like 110 degree heat are laughing at me
but whatever so I'm at United art and
education I'm about to go in I only go
once a year because I know if I went
throughout the year I would spend way
too much of my paycheck so I go in the
summer like every year and stock up and
then I don't let myself go again because
I know it's been too much but I love it
so let's go inside oh my gosh Kevin
teachery things and well it's so much
okay that's adorable I love it oh my
gosh the black and white stripes I'm
buying like three of these packs I love
it so I wanted to buy some like
ready-made letters and these plaid ones
are so cute but they also have these
like chalkboard ones I can't decide
okay Jake hey I found these letters and
they were like already cut out those are
cute okay I love this poster to put like
on my reading and writing area oh my
gosh yes
well so I really don't have like the
legitimate schedule things so I think
I'm finally gonna invite the board and
buy something like this just to have a
cute okay I'm getting some paper the
infants I'm getting like turquoise and
green and then these cute library
pockets for jobs also if you like that
writing you will love these these are my
absolute favorite
I don't ever end up using the like light
green because it doesn't show up as well
but these are amazing I'm totally okay
it might be dumb but I'm totally getting
this pearl lanyard because I feel like
I've been using the same lanyard for a
while and this would be way more fun to
wear so these are these like my own
plates
I had just plain ones last year but this
actually would be great for them to just
be glancing at all the time because it's
a lot of a separate review at the
beginning of the year I figure the only
lasts about half
I've been in my classroom like an hour
and I'm sweating they turn the air off
during the summer to save you know
energy and money and stuff but it's hot
but I put some black paper up and my
border don't make fun of the fact that I
am horrible at putting up bulletin board
paper horrible if you know any tricks
like it's so wrinkly but it's gonna be
mostly covered with stuff anyway so I'm
not too worried about it and I was like
I'm not wasting this I'm just putting it
up but but it kind of looks more like a
piano than I envisioned it looking so
that's alright though I'm excited I
might do color on this bulletin board
but let me show you my empty classroom
so I took like everything down off the
walls just about everything other than
like a couple things on those and of
course they've cleaned the floor and all
that stuff so it really is like
bare-bones
but I'm excited to have some fresh stuff
up but I'm still pulling putting up the
border around that okay so of course my
last name being bran I call my students
Bharani axe but that worked out really
well so I used the ribbon from the
Dollar Tree and I just poked did like a
hole punch on top of each letter and
then I did end up with the ribbon
stapling down every few letters cuz
otherwise it was hanging a little too
freely and it didn't look uniform I need
to spread them out just a little bit
more but ended up looking okay I like it
okay so I've got my news board my math
board and my reading board over there so
I ended up just going full-on with the
yellow teal in black I don't know what I
want but this worked out really well so
far and I did end up using all of the
little ribbons I got I mean not all of
it but I used all the colors I got from
the Dollar Tree of the ribbon so I ended
up using the yellow over there so I
think on that side I'm going to take
down the acts of kindness over there and
put up I'm torn because I need a writing
area but I also need like a social
studies science area now the reality is
I could take down the thinking maps and
maybe put those elsewhere I don't know
maybe like I could put the think maps in
below the board they
and then put like science associated
stuff up there I don't know but I really
do need a writing area so I think I'm
gonna take that down at least and do
that tonight and I think once I get that
done that's I'm gonna have to call it
for the night because it's getting late
and I am hungry
so yeah so far so good okay I'm gonna
call it a night but I got my writing one
up I ended up going with like a kind of
teal ish green and then you already saw
my reading one and my math and my kind
of news bulletin board I am sweating so
I'm gonna call it a night I'm gonna come
back sometime soon and keep working
okay so fast-forward a few weeks and we
start school tomorrow so I'm finally
kind of done with the room as done as I
will be before the year starts and then
things will get better and change and
morph as I get to know these students
and you know different needs and things
like that so I'm sure some of this will
change but this is as it is as I'm
starting the school year tomorrow and so
let me flip the camera around and show
you the after so you've seen my news
board it changed a little bit I ended up
making the schedule smaller I just
figured it'd be easier to reprint if I
needed a different one for like test
days or something like that but
everything else pretty much stayed the
same I got some different numbers for
that because I used the other numbers
for our cubbies and those were just
calendar numbers so that is set up I've
got our math board set up with some
vocab we've got problem-solving
strategies these are like school-wide
it's an initiative then I've got my
library down here these are baskets I
got on HauteLook comm I can link it
below but I I bought these labels on
teachers pay teachers and so then here
is my little reading corner I made these
pillows on Erin Condren comm so that one
says reading a good book and that one
says what have you learned today you can
just have them say whatever you want and
I've got these little lights from the
target section this some students made
me this is my reading board with room to
grow where I can say what unit and week
we're on our vocabulary words I just
typed these on like Microsoft Word our
big question things
that this is gonna be the classroom
management thing I'm going to start this
year I'm going to try its called beat
the teacher it's on Teachers Pay
Teachers it's free and then I made a
little brain break jar it's just a bunch
of popsicle sticks with different brain
breaks written on them so that's nice to
have it right here by my chair in the
front and then those are just read aloud
books then I've got my rug and my six
supply caddies so I tried to do them by
color but I didn't have enough scissors
of each color you know but they've got
their glue sticks I've got them all
labeled like if this is for their 4a 4b
4c etc I haven't done all those because
some of those will live in their desk
after the first day of school but so
that's what's in there and then over
here I got rid of my anchor chart you
said like a big like easel but it took
up a lot of room and it fell all the
time on student like it was totally like
I don't know it was just not a great
easel so I was really glad to get rid of
it and I'm just got these hanging on
here and so then I can move it if I want
but it can where I can totally create
them up there and use them to teach so
here's my writing one I've got the
posters I bought our spelling words and
our little writing process and then this
is for small groups so I've got all the
supplies I could ever need and this is
kind of a students are not allowed back
here kind of an area I might put like
tape on the floor to mark off but
fifth-graders usually are pretty good
you usually don't need to go that deep
like with tape but so these actually I
just like super glued these to the 3m
strip those will not stay on this wall
so I've got like questions for small
groups for reading that will eventually
hang there but that's pretty much what's
down there and then I've got our
learning targets with those Dollar Tree
things that I bought and I just made
these on Microsoft Word and then I still
have wearing oops I still have my
thinking maps up there and then our
homework area I've got some more of
those hanging tart warmer this is for
books that need to go back from the
library we've got our little testing
things that kind of sandwiched in there
they used to be really high up and the
students couldn't help me get them down
so I finally move them so they're really
easy
get when they have like spelling tests
and things like that so then I've got
the seven Habits which is big in our
school and then just little things I've
gotten from students in the past years
our mailboxes are back here I liked that
I kind of put it at this corner just
makes it a little more inviting and I
created all of these however I'm gonna
have 27 students starting the year and
there's only 24 boxes here so this might
end up being my last three students and
then I'll just maybe I'll just buy a new
one anyway um so lots of cabinets I've
got login info there which actually I
would like to redo those so back here is
just kind of my area I've got things of
copies I have boxes of supplies that I
haven't even gotten to yet we got a new
math set so I haven't even gotten into
that yet but this is where I keep like
for example Tuesday's the first day of
school so all my copies for that day are
and they're then Wednesday Thursday
Friday future things if I'm like really
overzealous and I make copies ahead of
time I usually make spelling test sheets
for them to actually take the tests on
and I just make like hundreds of copies
and leave them in there for the year
things like that so that's that area my
desk here this is like my true work
station I have like my grade book which
really I don't use my calendar I do use
and then this is just a notebook from
Erin Condren got these that I got at
Target I got this Bell on Amazon it's
really cool and yeah I mean that's
pretty much it I still haven't put their
name tags on this is where I have them
turn things in and then my class set up
just so you can see it from here
I've got lower desks here and then those
I got on Amazon I'm kind of thinking I
might need something bigger than that
but we'll see and we'll see which
students actually want to sit there so
that is a whole classroom oh I think I
forgot to show you something over here I
created this what's stuck with you today
thing for like an exit ticket for any
subject and I literally just got a black
like poster board and then a bunch of
post-its and then these are calendar
numbers and I kind of laid the post-its
out you know they kind of self stick and
then once I got them the way I wanted
them I glued them down then glued the
numbers on and then laminated it and so
then they can just take a post-it and
whatever their number is whatever the
question
I'm asking them they can stick it right
over here so I can really quickly see
when this is all covered who hasn't
answered the question
so sometimes it'll just be you know what
do you remember other times it'll be a
specific question maybe a math exit
ticket things like that so that is my
whole room it's it's come together it's
taken a while but I think I'm ready for
my fourth year teaching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
