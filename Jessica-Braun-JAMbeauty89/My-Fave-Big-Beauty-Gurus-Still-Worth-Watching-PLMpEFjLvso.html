gonna share with you guys big youtubers
that I still watch I say still for a
reason because I feel like and I know
I'm not alone because I hear this from
you guys too don't you guys feel like
the tides are changing a lot on YouTube
sometimes for the better sometimes for
the worst you know depending on what
you're looking at but I've talked a lot
in recent videos about decluttering my
subscription playlist or just my
subscriptions and just really
subscribing to the people I genuinely
want to watch a lot of people I'd been
subscribed to for years because of my
older bigger youtubers I want to make
sure I know what they're talking about
well who cares if I don't like watching
them so it was the most freeing feeling
in the world when one day I sat back
with a cup of tea and I unsubscribe from
probably a hundred channels so smaller
and I just never watched them but also
many many bigger channels now I'm not
going to talk about the ones I don't
watch anymore you'll probably notice
some names missing from this list and
you can put two and two together and
it's never you know this is not me
making a statement about these other
people's lives and you know oh I
disagree with this or I did it's nothing
like that it really is just more you
know these are the people I watch that I
trust and whether I watch them because
they make me laugh or I watch them
because I feel like they're really
honest or I watch them because holy moly
they know so much about makeup and I
want to know that stuff I have done a
video on my favorite channels under a
hundred thousand subscribers and yes I
do plan to do a video in the future of
maybe my favorite channels under ten
thousand because I know a lot of you
guys maybe even under 1000 I don't know
I got to work I got a look at my
subscriptions and see you know who do i
watch I don't really pay too much
attention to subscriber count with who
I'm watching cuz it doesn't really
matter you know if you like them who
cares but so I'll have to kind of go
through and organize it and figure out
what kind of a video I could do because
obviously who needs shout outs more than
anyone smaller channels trust me I know
that I started from somewhere to go so
yes I'm doing this bigger one today but
I
definitely plan to do a smaller one
because I know you guys need the love
and you deserve the left but I did want
to share it to these because I thought
it was kind of interesting to you
because I've watched a few people do
these and I'm like it is interesting to
hear who people watch out of the bigger
youtubers aundrea mattelli ah no I'm
going to consider these channels bigger
channels because they are they're more
than a hundred thousand so some of them
are the millions but a lot of them are
not those are I love watching so Andrea
I freaking love I was snapping about her
recently
sorry I'm in pajama pants I need to
readjust
I recently snapped about Andrea I I just
love her I feel like she's honest and
she's like me she'll still do sponsored
videos from time to time but I feel like
she makes really wise decisions and
who's she's being sponsored by and that
she's choosy and that's how I try to be
as well because you know I don't want to
work with a branch I don't care about or
I don't know about or I don't you know
and so I really respect that about her I
don't think there's anything wrong with
doing sponsored videos but if you're
doing only sponsored videos like there's
some youtubers that do one video a month
and it's a sponsored video and that's it
I'm like maybe you should pepper in some
you know on sponsored content um so I
just love her she um her background is
so pretty
she has like the most symmetrical face
I've ever seen in my entire life
like I look at her and just become
mesmerized cause I'm like what like how
is her face so perfectly symmetrical
anyway I absolutely adore her channel
she has two hundred forty-four thousand
subscribers she deserves way more her
her video ideas are fantastic she also
declares which I love you will like her
channel I'm telling you
Emily Noel 83 I mean can we get any more
original than that she's amazing she's
been churning out good content for years
and years and years and years and years
and years she knows what she's talking
about she's tried everything under the
Sun and she's just someone that you know
you can trust I was watching a Q&amp;amp;A she
did the other day and I'm like tearing
up watching because she was crying
talking about when her husband proposed
to her and I'm like oh my gosh like I
love when people can be real and they're
not they're not scared to cry but then
there are some people that you see
crying you're like are you just like
fake crying but like she's just such a
real human and even though she does like
how many
yes she has 950 thousand subscribers but
she she continues to have a mix of
drugstore high end which is exactly what
I tried to do on my channel as well she
inspires me so much so I absolutely love
her if you don't follow her what like
how do you not follow her I don't even
but I also love love and watch Rach love
she has like one almost 1 point 4
million subscribers she tries so many
new products it's wild so she's the
channel I go to when I'm like ok what's
new out there because she has already
done a video on it like she is so on top
of that it's crazy
I do sometimes feel overwhelmed and this
is nothing to do with her but sometimes
when I watch her I start to feel alone
because I'm like oh my gosh she's tried
so much new makeup this month like how
how is she like she can't even have time
to try it like I get stressed for her
because I know how I feel when I feel
like I had too much makeup and I needed
a clutter my heart starts pounding and I
like feel stressed because she does try
so much but it's you know it's for us
it's for the audience so we can see like
what's out there is it any good what
does it look like on and she is the
queen of trying things on camera and it
is amazing so I love her it's just a
happy Channel she's a very happy to know
another youtuber i watch is jackie ina i
met her at the other event i've gone to
him which was an elf event in new york
and she was so incredibly nice just
incredibly sweet and i know she can be
really sassy like on her Twitter but
frankly usually when I read it I'm like
she's saying things that maybe we're all
thinking not always but she she makes me
laugh but her videos are awesome she
again she's knowledgeable she is
well-spoken and I feel like I always
learn a little something new every time
I watch her videos now he's every
product she's using gonna work on my
skin
no is every product I'm using gonna work
on all of your skin no but I still feel
like I walk away with like amazing
product recommendations and tips and I
like her personality and I just love
watching her channel oh my gosh this is
someone that I watched long long ago and
her name is Liam says and she has let's
see
800,000 subscribers
tons of subscribers she's someone that I
somehow I don't know if I unsubscribe
from her or if I you know however
happened but I felt like there were
there was a span of a couple of years
that I forgot about her like I just I
never saw her in my I guess I wasn't
subscribed so randomly I saw her
suggested know what I forgot about Leigh
Ann says so that I watched it I'm like
and addicted again subscribe and I
watched a ton of her videos she's just
so kooky but not in a pretend pretend
way she just is and she'll just say
things and mutter things under her
breath and you know she's not like
trying to be kooky she that's just who
she is and it makes me laugh and and yet
she's so relatable and normal and she's
got the cutest fashion sense and I think
she's like wedding planning right now so
it's just like really exciting too so I
just I love her if you need a breath of
fresh air in your subscription feed
she's a great one to add I freaking love
beauty with Emily Fox
she has 388 thousand subscribers she
she's french-canadian she's got a slight
French accent and I freaking love it and
I know like she'll talk in videos about
how people will make fun of her accent
like are you freaking kidding me who
would me she has like the most beautiful
accent anyway so it just makes me mad
and also any time a word is French like
if it's a makeup Brendan's French and
she says it I'm like I just like drool
because she I mean she can speak French
so well and so it just sounds like the
way it should spend and anyway but she
has such good content I know she's
gotten really into also talking about
more books on her Channel in addition to
makeup which i think is really cool I'd
love to watch more videos like that I
love to read but I don't really watch
videos on books but I feel like I want
to so we'll see if I ever kind of dip my
toe in the water more but I really like
her again she's always trying new stuff
and it's just fun to watch coffee break
with Danny is one of my favorite
youtubers all-time and I mentioned her
the other day to my husband I'd like I
don't remember what in the world I was
talking oh I think I was showing a
picture of that dating and posted on
Instagram
and her hair is so pretty in the color
she's gotten it right now it's so pretty
and I was sometime I can tell if I ever
dyed my hair cuz I've never dyed my hair
but I said if I ever did I feel like I'd
like to go this color and he said well
who is that and I said coffee burg Danny
he's like oh like coffee burg date like
the YouTube you watch Mike yeah and he
doesn't know like he'll see faces of
youtubers I'm watching but he doesn't
always know their name and I'm like oh
you know who she is and he's like no
like she's one you've watched her years
and years and years Mike yeah he's like
you love her I'm like I do his so cute
but I do I freaking love her I love that
yet again she's so normal she knows so
much about makeup she's got so much
weight but the thing I love about her is
she
she'll say things that I know that she
knows someone's gonna be I can't believe
you said that
but she's saying it in a way that you
she's not trying to harm or offend
anyone she's not saying you know using
offensive words indeed but she'll say
things that you know like I if I'd said
it would have edited out of a video cuz
I'm like oh I know that someone's gonna
take offense to this but I didn't mean
it that way and I don't want it to be
misconstrued she puts it up anyway and
like I said it's never anything vulgar
or like intentionally offensive but it's
just something that she's just being
playful and fun and I freaking love that
about her she's part of what kind of
inspired me to be a little more of
myself on my channel I'm not so edited
because it's like we're all human I'm
not gonna say the perfect thing every
single time and when I have videos where
I've edited so much of my personality
out it's like well why even watch who
cares BEC don't I don't want to watch a
robot
tell me about makeup so I just I adore
her so so much I really do and she's one
of the few youtubers I watched their
vlogs she'll do like a weekly vlog I
usually watch that too if you are not
watching Jen loves reviews yet I've
talked about for years she's one hundred
twenty seven thousand subscribers
she has a weekly news show and it is
amazing and she has contributors I mean
it is like
and that's where I get all my makeup
news they go through like what are the
sales this week at like every makeup
website ever and store and what are the
new launches and what it is incredible I
mean this idea this brainchild of hers
that has spawned into something so
amazing that she's got all these other
contributors helping and I'm just every
week I'm amazed and I'm Solway sad when
she takes a week off course I'm like oh
crap what are we gonna watch on Sunday
morning on getting ready she it's
amazing subscribe to her if only for
that but then for other videos are
amazing too and she'll do these makeup
minutes where you can you know it's like
it was literally a really quick life
update like hey we just saw that this
product is launching on this date and
here are some swatches or hey you know
it's an amazing amazing channel to
subscribe to I love Jen I love Jen and
Jen loves refuse another youtuber is
Sunkiss Alba I discovered her because
she'd done a collab with derma e on
their like radiant facial oil and I'm
like who is this so I looked it up she
is first of all incredibly beautiful as
are like everyone i mentioning but she
she'll do like cleaning routines she
just did a pregnancy routine and i just
find myself like staring i like the way
she explains things and i'm excited she
you know i don't did she have her baby i
don't know but it's gotta be soon i mean
it really does but regardless it's just
so excited i bet she did cuz it looks
like it's been a while since she's
posted I wish she posted more but I
really really like her she's easy to
listen to
even her pregnancy routine I'm like I
need to like step up my game but she's
doing way better than me anyway but I
really really like her channel she
almost has a million subscribers a
Stephanie to call this someone I
recently started watching because that
girl knows so freaking much like she'll
get into the science behind certain
skincare products or ingredients and I'm
just like what like how do you know that
it's so cool it's so educational and yet
she's amazing at makeup too you know on
top of it all she's beautiful very
well-spoken but she just is so
knowledgeable
she has five hundred eight thousand
subscribers so she's one that I watched
when I'm just like
to learn today and I do like to learn as
a teacher I'm nerdy about that so she
she's incredible
Fleur de force I watch she has let's see
yeah almost 1.5 million subscribers I
love her though and again she was one
that fro there were a couple years I
didn't watch her not only if any reason
I just didn't really have an interest
too and then I recently picked back two
up and she just had her first kid so I
watched a lot of her pregnancy updates
and she's clearly wealthy and so it
shows through and like her favorites
they're almost always incredibly
luxurious items however I still like
watching them cuz everyone so I'm like
I'll hear I'll see something I'm like
okay maybe that's the product I want
that I might think about buying but I
mean she she definitely focuses a lot on
luxury things but you know what there's
a market for that a lot of you guys
really you know I've gotten comments
from you guys like I really don't like
your drugstore videos I want more luxury
and then of course I get even more in
the opposite like I'd rather see so I
try to keep it semi balanced but also I
just I can't fathom spending that much
money I make up all the time but I know
she gets sent a lot of stuff and I think
that's a part of it too you know it's
not necessarily her buying it how did I
get onto this anyway
I love her I think she's just like sweet
as a button I'm so excited for her and
her husband and their baby and I loved
watching her little nursery tour and
there's just something about her that
just makes my heart happy so I really
like her she is British so she's got a
lovely accent aprilathena7 she's got
five hundred ninety two thousand she's
the one that I'd recently watched a
Costco like shop with me vlog and I was
like I want to do this I had so much fun
watching it but she'll do like Dollar
Tree hauls I think she was the reason I
ever started doing them she inspired me
there she again she's just a happy happy
person and she definitely she doesn't
just focus on makeup she definitely does
you know like home kinds of things like
oh these are my favorite cleaning
products and stuff but for me as I'm
kind of entering this phase in my life
where you know I am about to have a baby
and you know I've now on the homeowner
as well and I'm enjoying that kind of
content more I guess is what I'm saying
to make up so I really like her channel
Estee lalande is again another og she's
got 1.2 million
I don't watch every single one of her
videos that I love her beauty videos
because she is always trying brands I've
never heard of and she's got products as
favorites that have never heard of and
I'm like that's so much fun
and so that's another thing one of my
goals for 2018 was just to try a lot
more brands that I don't know anything
about or I've only tried one product and
because that's one of my goals I love
watching her channel in her like
favorites videos cuz I'm like literally
every single time I sit down to watch a
video first I'm learning about brands
I've never ever heard of in my entire
life now some of them she does live in
the UK I want to say in London so I
don't know you know some of them I might
not even be able to get here in the
States anyway I don't know but it's it's
so really exciting to learn about okay
now I'm gonna talk about Holly is she
her channel is Holly eats lips oh no she
changed it now it's just Holly Forest
good for you girl um I met her at like
what the one of two events I've ever
gone to for YouTube and it was like the
two-faced sweet peach palette and I met
her and we ended up talking for quite a
while and I she is like the friendliest
sweetest like I just really like so even
my husband was like she was so nice I'm
like she really was like she was so
normal and she's I want to say she grew
up in California she definitely lives
out there and you know what can be very
hit-or-miss when I've met people at
events like I have met some incredibly
sweet youtubers oh my gosh even that
night I met so many incredibly sweet and
then I've also met some that were just
kind of like ooh like you can tell like
they were just networking while they're
there it was so weird to watch cuz I'm
just like watching I'm like oh my gosh
that's like that's like it's the story
for another day holy moly cuz that was
just wild to watch but you know I'm just
there and feeling kind of awkward no one
knows who I am like I'm just supposed oh
but it was really cool to meet her and
she watched my channel and I watched her
so I'm like this is so cool
and she's just lovely her she is the
queen of drugstore and I learned about a
lot of drugstore products from her
Ingrid Nilsen
Elson is another one she's got almost
four million subscribers
she definitely posts a lot less what is
that about when you're a bigger youtuber
that you suddenly post like and I'm not
pointing her out intentionally but
that's something like do you have less
time like and I get that maybe they're
doing other projects and see your time
it's just different
but it is kind of odd if you think about
it I don't know like maybe if I ever hit
I'd be like well sorry yeah but I don't
foresee that because I enjoy filming and
I know they do too it's just kind of odd
it really is odd to me um and maybe it's
that they're making so much money per
videos that they're like that I don't
really need to like I don't know what
the mentality is the reasoning and I'm
sure it's different per youtuber but it
is interesting to notice happen to
almost every single one almost not all
anyway she's another one just like Estee
where I feel like when I watch her
videos and again she does lots of
different kinds of videos now but the
few that I do watch I always learned
about new brands or you know she's
really into skincare right now and so
I'm always learning about new specific
products I'm like and I'm always like
doing it now I want to add that one of
my support card dang it now I want to
add that you know and I think that's I I
really appreciate that feel like this
list is so long Iman is another one that
I watch and she how many subscribers
really I would have guessed she's got
millions seven hundred seventy-one
thousand she's such a natural beauty but
I just I love hearing her and watching
her put on makeup because she did one
video and I know I've talked about this
on probably snapchat a long time ago
where she was talking about how we all
put so much foundation on her face and
many of us don't need that much where
you know we're covering things that
don't need to be covered and it was so
inspiring to me and I just like fell in
love with her right in that moment and I
watched pretty much all of her uploads
her tutorials she is a totally different
you know facial structure I shaped in me
but I still love watching them and again
and feel like I always learn a thing or
two and I watch her videos
Gotham ista is another one i watch she
knows I mean she is a completely
skincare focused Channel and she
actually knows her stuff
so I don't know she actually like I've
never watched a video like about her I
think she's got to have some kind of
background in like she might be a
dermatologist but I love the way she
explains things and so she'll go through
you know certain brands that are really
popular and talk about why these brands
are you know what about them is great
what specific products are really
high-quality what maybe isn't she'll
tell you how they harvested it she'll
contact the companies and ask the
questions I mean she is where I go if
I'm like I wonder about this skincare
I'll look and see if she's done a video
on it and almost half I would say 70
percent of times she has done a video on
it so you know like a lot of those
expensive ones like trunk elephant the
ordinary or the ordinary so expensive
but those really popular things
she's already talked about in videos and
it's incredible to watch so she's
another one that I highly recommend you
subscribe to okay I gotta stop there I
feel like I'm scrolling through and I
could name like 15 more I'm like we got
to cut it somewhere just because this is
getting really really long and I did not
expect this to be this long so if you
enjoyed this definitely give it a thumbs
up let me know by subscribing as well
and hitting that notification bell and I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
