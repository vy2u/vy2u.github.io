probably the most fun video I've ever
felt in my life I got to go through my
makeup collection and pick out the
product that if all of my makeup
disappeared maybe someone robbed me
maybe my place burned down god forbid or
whatever if I had to start all over what
products would i buy again what would be
the first product I would say I need
this today let's go to the store and buy
them so it was no fun picking this stuff
out and honestly there are some times
and I'm like I don't care I'm sharing
them with you guys anyway because this
was so fun so some people call this the
ride-or-die tag don't know what to call
this I might caught that I might call it
just makeup I can't live without but
regardless of what I'm calling this this
is just a collection of makeup my
favorite favorite makeup from all of the
years of kind of being in this world and
doing research and trying out so many
things reps or anti and there's a good
amount of them that are drugstore
there's also some high-end of course but
these are different favorites so if you
enjoyed this video definitely subscribe
tap the notification bells you get
alerted when I upload new videos and
let's go and get into it I don't even
know where to start let's just start
we'll try to go maybe any order that I
would do my makeup I start with my face
so my ride-or-die primer and I don't
talk about this one that much is the
cover FX calming primer I love this
stuff so much a youtuber named Kendra I
think her name is vlog with Kendra I
love her but I remember hearing her talk
about this Justin to declutter kind of
flippantly you know but I was like that
just sounds interesting
so I bought it and I love it it's just
the perfect primer to use it's you know
kind of moisturizing kind of calming and
I feel like the second I put it on my
skin it's probably a placebo effect but
I feel like the second I put it on my
skin my skin feels calmer and it's
hydrated and I just love it and I do
feel like it helps with the longevity of
the makeup but it also just helps my
skin look its best before I put on a
foundation and I just love it for that
okay so the next one is also kind of a
primer this is the milk makeup blur
stick I love this stuff I know so many
people on YouTube are talking about it
and I know a lot of you guys are like is
it gimmicky like no it actually works
like you put it on your nose anywhere
you feel like you've got pores
so I use this almost every single day
and I feel like it hasn't gone down at
all so it's going to last you a long
time but it's just that perfect thing
even if you're in a hurry you can
quickly go sweat-soaked left foot flat
and then put something on without any
other primer and so what I usually do is
put this on there and then the calming
primer elsewhere on my face
I just love both of these night I feel
like I couldn't live without both
foundation wise so what I'm wearing
today the number-7 stay perfect this one
quickly raised through the ranks rise
through the ranks to become my favorite
it's got amazing coverage it's got a
pump you can get it at Target I think
you can get number seven now at Ulta and
of course on like all these products
below but I just love it it's the best
foundation
I think the L flawless finish was very
close to making a list because I love
that foundation I really do these are
very similar but I think this one's just
a little bit better and I love it
I love it because it doesn't like I've
got dry skin it doesn't make my skin
look dry it's amazing so my favorite CC
BB cream is the it cosmetics CC cream it
really looks like a foundation guys
don't let the name fool you because it
might as well be a foundation I treat it
as such but what I love about it is as
SPF of 50 so I often travel with this
because it's got SPF so I don't even
have to worry about putting anything
else on I'm already protected with this
and it's got totally high coverage it's
not drying it's amazing it is one of
those products that I got so tired of
hearing people talk about so I finally
bought it and I'm so glad I did because
it's amazing wearing a muumuu today like
the legitimate movement it has been
loves it so next one one more foundation
but it's the stick one this hourglass
vanish foundation any time I thought to
any YouTube event which I've not gone to
very many of only gone the like to but
I've always worn this because it's so it
doesn't have any flashback at all which
is huge it's the easiest thing to travel
with in both times I was traveling to
different places it wasn't near where I
live something happens where I live
anyway but you just kind of swipe it on
and you can use a brush you could
probably use your fingers I've never
really done it that way but I usually
use a dense brush and I just spread it
out and it's so flawless now you do
Sophie a little bit of why
drying it if you have it but it's not
enough that it makes me out one wear it
because it just looks so amazing in
photos it looks amazing as long as
you're like a foot away from someone if
they're like right up near you they're
probably going to see it you know but I
still love it it's one that the second
it runs out I'm going to get another one
I love love love love this foundation
and I will tell you this I tried many
other six foundations and I've returned
I had two Anasazi when I returned that I
have the makeup forever one I'm thinking
about returning that this is so much
better I don't know what in the world
they have in it it is so much better
because I feel like most foundation
sticks are really really drying and
that's why I'm like how do people like
this because you spread it it's just
like dry this stuff is like the most and
lowly and stuff it just spreads all over
in its beautiful concealer I have one
corrector in one concealer this Bobbi
Brown corrector is so good the pixie one
that I talked about I have a do to do I
filmed this it's up I will link it it's
not stay tuned in the dupes video I did
a dupe for this one it's really really
good it's a pixie one and it is about
half the price but this one is just one
step above because you put it on any
dark circles you have I have it in white
bisque and it just completely erases
them and you just like tap it on and
then you let blend it with your finger
and it's gone it is so beautiful it
stays in place and this is one of those
things again that I'm not going to run
out of this any time soon it'll go bad
before I run out of it unfortunately but
i love it i'm totally traveling with
this it's so good now the concealer this
is another one that might surprise you i
really don't talk about much this is the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I
bought it because frankly I thought the
packaging is cute I'm going to be very
very honest that is why I bought it
I hadn't really heard good or bad things
about it I have the shape tape I have
the Kat Von D lock at cream concealer
I've got all kinds of high-end
concealers and this one's still high-end
but I just like this one it I feel like
it covered what I needed to cover but it
doesn't make it doesn't make me look
cakey and weird I feel like the Tarte
shaped eight no matter how I apply it
doesn't look great period and like I
still like out so use it but honestly
will I rebuy it when I'm done with that
one I don't know that I will this one I
totally would it's just so perfect for
everyday it blends really
it covers enough it's comfortable it
looks good and I really like the
applicator it's a really flat applicator
and for some reason I just like applying
it that way it's just I really like it I
don't know why more people aren't
talking about this let's talk powders I
have a few by a cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination powder
foundation this is my ride-or-die period
I'm constantly looking for dupes for
this I found a few in the drugstore that
I can link below that I think are pretty
close to this but this one I've already
hit pan once I run out I'm going to have
to rebuy I've not found anything I found
so many things that come close but never
is good it's got so much coverage it
looks beautiful on the skin but it
doesn't look powdery or cakey I don't
know how they do it it almost looks
illuminating but there's no shimmer or
glitter it's like magic it's so so good
I love it so much the next powder this
one doesn't have coverage like that one
but it has a very similar kind of dimly
lit look to the face it's the hourglass
dim light powder this this shade comes
in the trio they sell if you want to get
more bang for your buck but for me I
wanted the full size because I love this
and I want to travel with this this is
why I love that tree on the first place
it's just kind of a powder that kind of
gives you a thin veil of like glow enos
there's no shimmer or glitter like at
all you can't detect but there's some
kind of pigment in it that just catches
the light so beautifully you can put it
all over your face I put it everywhere
and I don't look like a grease ball or
anything it just looks so healthy and
that is why I love this so much I feel
like everyone kind of forgotten about it
but I am NOT because I love it
my favorite loose powder the Laura
Mercier loose setting powder if they're
translucent it is a makeup artist
favorite for a reason there's no
flashback I've tried to cover FX one and
I did a comparison video I can link
below if you want to see them
side-by-side and how they look I just
love this one
periods I just love it nothing has come
close every time I wear it I feel like
my makeup does not budge all day long
there's no flashback it's so good you
get a lot of product and I just love it
okay moving along I've got some bronzer
blush highlight my writer
bronzor is the number seven golden sands
bronzer I just feel like this is so
beautiful they have a couple shades not
only is the packaging beautiful but it's
had a good price point where you're not
breaking the bank buying a bronzer that
you might not wear I don't wear bronzer
every day so I don't necessarily need a
really expensive bronzer I'd rather save
my money and just use it on something
that a still stays on all day but it's
just beautiful I was tossing around I
have my like Chanel one that's like the
cream I love that stuff but I feel like
I go through phases with it where I use
it all the time and then I don't use it
for a while but this is one that I use
all the time and again it's the newer
one to me that just kind of rose through
the ranks and I adore it so Target and
Ulta they sell it my ride-or-die blush
was so easy I opened my blush or and
instantly grabbed it I was like this
like almost amazing emotional I love it
so dumb I love this blush this is the
benefit Dallas blush I have traveled
with it to so many places in the world
and I think maybe that's why it makes me
emotional because it's been so many
places this needs this box and this
blush is so amazing because it just
looks so beautiful
it's all bronzer life so you don't even
need a bronzer with it and it just
there's something about it with my skin
tone that I love and it looks like such
a boring blush doesn't it I mean it
doesn't look like anything special it's
not shimmery it's not super pink or
peach but that's why I like it it looks
so normal it has this light fragrance to
it that smells so nice and if they ever
discontinue this you better believe I
would buy like four and just be good for
life because I feel like four well maybe
I need like ten I don't know it's I love
it so much I have two different kind of
highlighters so my first one is this
Laura Mercier matte radiance based
powder this might be the prettiest
highlighter I own this is one that I can
go ahead and put it on I guess you can
see it this is one that you it almost
makes it you look like you're not really
wearing highlighter I mean you can
definitely tell of course I'm putting
this on top of another but this is the
most pretty everyday highlight where you
just look like glowy but it doesn't look
like there's a huge strip on your face
like I said I just put this on top of
another highlighter so it's so worth the
money the closest I found is that
pure nude it's very close so if you know
you can't afford it then buy that
because it's just as beautiful but I do
think this one lasts a bit longer on the
face and it's oh my gosh I love it so
much I would totally dry this again but
if you want to punch you highlight this
with is easily my favorite this is the
pixie and Aspen over London luster glowy
powder and it's just this gorgeous
almost stark white highlighter but it
looks so so beautiful on the skin I mean
so beautifully and if you know you get
it at Target and I just feel like every
time I wear it I'm like yes like it's so
so good at lasts all day and this is an
easy easy choice for me we've got eyes
and lips left to do and brows okay let's
start with eyes I picked one palette one
out of all my palettes
I picked one palette that genuinely I
love enough that I would go out and buy
it again if I lost it and that was hard
and I kind of realized something about
myself I feel like I don't really love
love any of my palettes like there are
some that I'm like I love these shades I
love but that is one thing every time
I've traveled I struggle with picking
what palette because I'm like I don't
feel like there's any one palette that
does absolutely everything I want it to
do isn't that kind of fat like I was
like that's kind of sad again their
house I love and I've talked about the
best it's not that I don't love them but
I really didn't feel like there was one
singular palette that I was like this is
a Jessica palette but this one is the
closest this is the Too Faced chocolate
bar and I'm going to be honest I was
surprised with myself in this choice but
as I opened it I instantly felt happy
and when I open the other ones I was
like oh I love this shade of it but I
didn't feel like the way I felt when I
opened this one I don't know if it's
accommodation of the smell and I love
the formula B's but I just love this
combination of colors it really does the
only thing I would add to this is a
matte black I wish it out a matte black
but it literally has everything else I
could need everything else and so for
that reason and the fact that every look
I've ever done with it I've loved and
you could do so many different looks
with it it's just awesome in such a good
palette so moving along
singular shadow from the drugstore that
I would totally buy again is the
wet-and-wild single in brulee I actually
found this at the Dollar Tree and I
think it's originally a dollar
ninety-nine so it's like a dollar off
but I go to the Dollar Tree all the time
to make up what I did a Dollar Tree get
ready with me video if you would be
interested in seeing it I will link it
below anyway I was just trying out a
bunch of their products that are always
there you can find in like every dollar
tree to see which ones are good and
which ones are bad and I would say about
half an hour half we're good enough for
terrible anyways but I love this it's
amazing at just setting your eye you can
help mix with it to put it under your
brow bone it's just a all-around amazing
shadow for a dollar ninety-nine now my
favorite eye primer ever ever ever
it's from math it's the Mac Pro Longwear
Paint Pot in soft ochre it's just my
favorite it's the perfect shade for me
it's the perfect consistency if blanks
everything out it holds onto shadow I
mean it's just my favorite there's I
looked at all of my primers and I
thought that is the one I consistently
want to use and want to grab so I would
totally buy this again and inevitably
when I run out of it I will buy it again
I love looking at all these products
cause either just my favorite oh I
should have mentioned this with faith
this is the Urban Decay all nighter
spray this is my second one so I have
repurchased it I have seven eight
setting sprays and this one is so good
it's so good and honestly this one or
the skin Danai via all night well do
they call Co later but it's their makeup
setting spray it's the same thing so by
the same company the skin and Naevia
makes the Urban Decay ones but they're
both so good I just happened to rebuy
this one I switch back and forth they
are the best I love my Milani make it
last that one is so good it comes so
close but I do feel like my makeup lasts
just a little bit longer with this I
love it I need to get a smaller size of
this to travel with so for brows this is
an easy one the anasazi a dip brow if
you are like me I got so annoyed with
people talking about and love me on the
side via dip brow it's like the best and
I'm so mean listen to me I'm such a brat
but I would want to be like because I
didn't understand pomades I'd be like
I'm not putting on way too dark way too
pigmented to put in my brow
well and I was totally a pencil girl and
then I was like a powder girl because
those were easier to manage for me well
I finally realize like I'm just going to
try it what is all the fuss about so I
got a bought the August Agia brush you
totally don't need it I have an elf one
I've been using lately that's really
good it is an angled brush and you just
brush once you get some brush a lot of
it off on like a tissue or something
pull through your brows and then just
start lightly putting it in you will see
why it's so good a it does a budge B I
have it actually I don't have this in my
brows I have a lore'l one I'll link the
L'Oreal one below as well I like this
one better because the L'Oreal one is
not as easy to comb through but it's
totally pretty close and it doesn't move
either I mean it gives you the same look
at the end it's just the application is
a little bit different this was a little
bit creamier easier when you're spooling
through it after you put it in your brow
and kind of wiping off the edges it's so
beautiful I've worn it every day for
months and months and months
I never even reached for my pencil very
much and less like there's just an area
and I'm like oh I missed that I'll fill
it in it's the best ok eyeliner I have a
pencil a liquid and a gel eyeliner to
mention today and then we'll do lips
oh and mascara you guys already know
what last year I'm going to tell you
about so for under the hour plus 1.5
millimeter liners are so good and
they're so expensive I'm going to be
honest the black one is the one I love
I haven't repurchase it yet because I'm
like I can't do it it's too expensive
but I need to do it because it is so
good the reason it's so good is it's
creamy and budge proof that's a big deal
but you can find a lot of that in the
drugstore but the fact of the matter is
it is the thinnest eyeliner I have found
I bought the pink master precise skinny
one from Maybelline it's not as thin as
this I've tried the NYX really skinny
one it's not as thin as this and neither
one of them is as creamy so however they
did this is magic this is the brown one
in Canyon
but these are just so so creamy I mean
like they go out on way too easily but
the fact that they're thin so you can
actually control what you're doing you
get tight line you can put it on your
waterline whatever you want to do with
it you can do with this and I love it so
much I'm
going to bite the bullet and buy and
actually I think I will buy it before we
travel because I want to bring it the
liquid liner is this is so good the NYX
epic ink liner this one quickly got up
to become a writer die for me because I
love this Stila stay all day for the
longest time this one is so much cheaper
and it's just as good it might be better
and that's why I was like this is what
I'm going to mention because this is the
one I'm buying again when I run out it's
super black it looks like a felt-tip but
it's actually a brush similar to the Kat
Von D but I think this one's better than
the Kat Von D as well this is another
one I used in my dupe video that I did
it's just amazing it's like five or six
bucks I will totally buy it again and
again and again I finally found the best
liquid liner for so cheap thank you the
best cream liner is this L'Oreal
blackest black lacquer liner I talk
about it constantly it's the only one I
use it is literally I've tried so many
others I always go back to this it's the
best one the Maybelline eye studio is
really good as well I love bold but
L'Oreal I just tend to like just to set
more it's just super black it doesn't
budge you can get a thick wide thin line
or whatever kind of brush you want to
use with it but I love this I wear it
every single day mascara it cosmetics
superhero easily I'm wearing it today
best best mascara ever it holds the curl
it's super black is volumizing without
being clumsy like I've never loved a
mascara as much as I love this one it is
totally life-changing now that I tried
this every other mascara I try them like
because I look at my my lashes at the
end of the work day and be like what
they're not even curled this looks the
same when you apply a person when you're
done working for the day it looks the
same it's unbelievable this lip scrub is
the best this is the Milani keep it
sweet sugar lip scrub when I run out I'm
buying it again if it were gone I'd go
up buy it again smells like a vanilla
dream and you just get some and you just
scrub it on your lips and easily wipe it
off and you're done and it just feels
amazing it smells amazing
it's somewhat moisturizing for a scrub
which is amazing and it's cheap I don't
have a lipstick to show you and I don't
have a lip a true lip gloss and I don't
have a liquid lipstick to show you or
like lip liner because honestly as I
went through like I don't feel strongly
enough about any of these I love my Marc
Jacobs
one but I haven't been wearing those
lately just because I'm kind of out of
that mood and sounds like I'm not going
to force it I want to genuinely show you
products but if I ran out I would go buy
these again this is the l'oreal
infallible paint lips and this is the
shade spicy blush this formula is
incredible it's like the most
comfortable color it oh my gosh it's so
good if I like lost it I would run to
the store the same day and go buy it I
wear it all the time I had to go fish it
out of my purse it's so so good the
thing I'm wearing on my lips today is
from Neutrogena and it's their
Neutrogena moisture smooth color stick
in the shade pink nude I was so tired of
this kind of lip product like remember
the Revlon like color burst things or
whatever they were called and they you
know all these different brands had
these I was like whatever
well when I tried this I'm sure it was
like Emily Noelle that she always gets
me on - Neutrogena because I like never
try it and she's like it's so good in
her video and I'm like okay I need it
anyway this one is so beautiful it's
comfortable it smells amazing it looks
great I actually this was what I used
obviously in the tutorial for today
because I love wearing this every single
day you don't need a mirror to apply it
it's comfortable it feels good on your
lips it doesn't look crazy and I just
love that the last product is a tool and
it's the elf makeup remover pen I can't
live without this I buy these on backup
because when I do my winged liner I
always clean it up with this it's three
bucks I think and I usually buy like a
bunch of them all I do is once I use it
you get obviously lighter on it I just
wipe it off on a tissue or a washcloth
near me and that keeps it cleaner for a
pretty long time you could take it out
and flip it around if you want as well
it's just not a chisel tip but these are
so many expensive that honestly once I
get to that point I just throw it away
and get a new one because I would say I
replace it every couple of months you
could totally replace it every month but
mine usually lasts me quite a while but
I had to mention it because this is
totally a stand by in my collection that
I use every single day so those are all
of my favorite favorite Holy Grail
makeup items I hope that you enjoyed
