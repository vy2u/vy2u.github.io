got a video featuring all of my favorite
YouTube channels I tried to keep these
youtubers under a hundred thousand I
have plenty of youtubers that watch that
are bigger youtubers and if you'd be
interested in seeing that kind of
counter part of a video let me know and
I can certainly film that for you guys I
don't know that the list of bigger
youtubers is as long as this list
however and this is kind of a new thing
for me that I've just been so into just
finding new channels fresh content and
its really inspired me on my channel and
I know a lot of you guys have paid me
compliments like wow you're so creative
with your videos like no like it's all
of these other amazing channels that are
out there so I'm trying to shout them
out like if I use an idea of there's
like a video they did because these
there are so many creators on YouTube
and you know with the YouTube algorithm
being the way that it is as far as I
understand it it's not very helpful for
smaller channels I don't know that it
really ever has been but especially
lately with the changes they've made so
I'm excited to feature I mean this list
is like like I feel like I have like
almost 20 channels so it's a lot of
course I will have them linked in the
order that I mentioned them down below
and other than that let's talk about
some amazing youtubers so alright we're
gonna start with our nough Elaine she
has I wrote I felt like a long messy
list of my youth tubers that I wanted to
talk about
she has 49 thousand subscribers give or
take and she is I think from Australia
maybe newsela I'm not sure exactly I
think Australia but you know amazing
accent for someone that's just from
America so to me I'm like our accent is
stupid
her accent is cool um it is anyway but
she's very very fair and so if you're
someone that you struggle to find like a
shade that matches you and foundations
and concealers she's someone you'd want
to follow when it comes to that she'll
do you know reviews on the lightest
shade of different foundation ranges so
that's really really helpful for really
really fair people that need that you
know kind of expertise but she's just
like really chill she'll play classical
music in the background which I really
enjoy I remember one of the first videos
I ever watched of hers she was plank
like I want to say like a
Chopin's song was playing it I was like
and subscribe but guy loved it I love
Chopin I am a nerd I'm drinking some
decaf espresso although it's like what's
the next size up from espresso one go
next she and I wanted to bring up his
make up struggles and she's got 19,000
subscribers I'm laughing because she is
the channel I go to when I want to laugh
because she is hilarious
now she does curse so if you're like not
into that or you maybe you've got kids
that you don't want here you might want
to save her videos for later you know
whatever she is hilarious and she is so
honest and I love she does these beauty
community like chats sometimes
she'll just talk about it in like a get
ready with me sometimes she'll do
separate videos and I love them and I
remember there was one recently was it
was like a really really long video and
I just sat there and just watched it and
laughed and laughed and laughed because
she's speaking so many truths about this
weird YouTube community that a lot of us
are involved in or that we love we watch
videos and it's just refreshing to see
like it feels like it just most of these
youtubers make me feel like a fresh rain
just washed across like the whole street
and it's like fresh air because it's
just new faces new thoughts new ideas
and I just freaking love it oh and she
does these videos that um like palettes
I would redesign or she'll go through
different palettes and talk about like
okay I would kick this shade out and I'd
put this kind of shade in I mean it's so
interesting next one I want to mention
is Kelly Koontz she's got 21 thousand
subscribers again these numbers were
give or take from the time I wrote these
down a couple days ago but anyway she is
just like down-home sweet like I just
like her and there's something about her
that makes me feel like when I was in
college I would have been friends with
her and I don't know what it is like why
College specifically sticks out to me
but like I feel like I see someone I
would have met in college and we would
have stayed friends beyond that I know
that's so specific whatever but I just
like her and I think if you watch her
channel she's just a very likable person
she is very thoughtful in what she says
she's very good at not saying um which
I'm trying to work on that I know yet
again that's a really
weird specific thing that I like about
her but I do and whatever but and again
she's got really really fresh of video
ideas next one Ashley Clady has 40,000
subscribers she is like the cutest
person I've ever seen like she if you've
never seen her you could watch 10
seconds of her video any video and
you'll be like oh my gosh she's sweet as
pie she's just like smiley and just
sweet and so beautiful as all of these
people and just like just happy like I
don't think I've ever seen her not
smiling at anyone second in her video
but I love it as she's so beautiful her
recommendations have always been spot-on
and so I just she's one of those people
that when I'm like in a mood that I'm
like I just need to like smile I'll
watch her videos cuz they're very very
happy next person I wanted to mention is
Nikki beauty bliss she's a recent
discovery and actually she might be
surprised to know this but she had
mentioned me in one of her videos and
she tweeted at me this was very very
recently like very like days ago and so
I went and I watched her video and I
fell in love with her personality she
was so sweet she said the nicest things
and it was just like it absolutely made
my day and I was kind of having a crummy
day when I watched the video so it was
really really nice I might be a little
bit obsessed with her because after
watching that video I subscribed and
watched tons of her videos like I'm
talking decades that's not there any
words for them but you know I mean like
joking like 30 to 35 videos of hers
within like a day or two she is 38
thousand subscribers I don't know if I
mentioned that but she does a lot of
decluttering videos which I really
appreciate she's even done recent like a
jewelry to clutter that I liked watching
cuz I needed to clutter my jewelry too
and she's just super chill she's got
hair similar to mine so that like I
always feel like kindred with people
that have curly hair I don't know why
but yeah I don't know I just I just fell
in love with her because she did seem
just so chill and very much like I feel
like she and I have similar
personalities and that's why I just felt
instantly like I clicked with her so
really excited to new we know about her
channel we'll be watching her channel me
at the March is another youtuber I love
i've collabed with recently she's got
45,000 subscribers amazing amazing
youtuber she's so
at makeup and I think she I don't think
she doesn't think she is but because
she's you know she's admitted you know
I'm newer to make up stuff like that I
think she's really in her head but she's
such an amazing makeup artist I don't
think she knows it I don't know does
that make sense but I absolutely adore
her and she's also an author so she's
just the way she speaks she's very
intelligent she's very thoughtful about
the purchases she makes which I
appreciate as yet you know another
consumer you know watching videos and
she will do these will I buy up videos
where she'll talk about new products out
there and then she'll discuss you know
am I gonna buy it why or why not and
it's a really cool way to do not
necessarily like an anti haul but you
know to talk about new products kind of
just chat about makeup but also really
get into depth it's like why would you
know if I'm wanting this palette why am
i wanting it do I really really need it
and it's it's cool to hear her thought
process out loud and I would love to do
videos like that let me know if you'd be
interested in that because I just think
it's really I like watching them
Nikki Murphy is another one she's got
20,000 subscribers she recently sent me
a sweet gift a baby gift and it was so
so kind but she is someone that I
followed for years we've talked like via
social media and through YouTube just
kind of off and on over the years my
maiden name was Murphy so I feel like
we're kind of kindred in that way too
but I don't know I feel like I've known
about her channel forever I watch all of
her videos she does these I'm talking
very fast I know she does these chats
fat videos that again she'll talk about
the YouTube community beauty in general
societal norms and just all kinds of
things like that that I am interested in
so I really really enjoy watching those
videos as well in addition to just her
makeup videos so she's an awesome
channel to watch another youtuber I love
is ELISA stylish and literate
she's got 12,000 subscribers and she is
someone that when I just want to like
chill she's got a really mellow vibe
about her and I really appreciate that
like if I you know it's been a long day
at work or I'm just trying to unwind
regardless of the day she's just so
chill and I am addicted to her empties
video she's very regular about her
empties and I loved watching it seeing
what skincare and beauty products she's
going through I always find myself
watching her empties videos before
anyone else's
I don't know why she's one of those
things but I just I like her whole vibe
and I think if you watch a video of hers
you'll get what I mean like how she's
just chill again she's intelligent
sounding which I also appreciate and
yeah I just really like her next is
simply hope she's got one point three
thousand and she I don't even remember
how I originally found her but I know
like she did a jam beauty 89 made me buy
a video a while back I don't know if
that's how I found her but I think it is
she's just lovely and she's just such a
happy bubbly person and she when I watch
her videos they make me think of like
old school YouTube not that what she's
doing is necessary like it seems like
it's just that there's something about
her and her personality that makes me
think of when I was starting YouTube and
I mean she's way more professional than
I was and I was starting please that's
not what I'm saying but just there's I
don't know there's something about her
and I just love that and so again I just
feel this connection with her and I love
watching her videos I don't miss
honestly I watched like all of the
videos from all of these people for the
most part unless it's just really
something I'm not interested in but
these are all youtubers that I'm like
yes they uploaded yes next one is
Melissa Parata okay how many subscribers
oh she's got 50 mm oh I have watched her
since before I had a channel and she her
kind of thing is she calls that her
subscribers honey bees and because I
think her channel is secondly named
honey bee philosophy and she'll have her
mom in videos sometimes and she tells
her mom mama bee and I just I just love
her there's something about her she does
logs like once weekly vlogs and she's
just so into pretty things like she her
nails are always so beautiful her
decorations like in her where she lives
in her house you know everything is just
so pretty and and yet she's so just
normal at the same time like she's the
perfect mix of those things and so I
just love watching her I always have I
think my favorite kinds of videos of
hers are hauls I know for a long time
she worked at Sephora and I I want to
say she doesn't work there anymore but I
love watching people that worked at work
or worked at Sephora because they know a
lot about products out there that maybe
you and I don't know about and so I like
watching those kinds of you
iZON Allison one of my favorite decluttr
errors she's got four point five
thousand subscribers she's an amazing
declutter er and that cannot be a word
but whatever
it seems right though right declutter
she's just lovely she's so good at
decluttering she's very cutthroat oh I
love watching them I'm like dying for
her to do more all the time because
she's one of those people that when
she's got a declutter up I'm like
everyone get out of my way
play just like sit back and watch and
she's one that always inspires me to
declutter more than what I am so I just
oh I love it
fancy that with Candice she's got 39
thousand subscribers again just a happy
bubbly person she runs maybe Ashley
Clady in a lot of ways I've been
watching Candice for a couple years now
she's got a couple kiddos and I just
found out she's pregnant too and I'm
like oh my god so exciting I want to say
she has two kids and maybe this or third
I might be wrong on the numbers but I
just adore her very very happy again I
feel like I've never seen her not
smiling like how do people do that how
do people do that like I can easily not
smile in fact I enjoy not quietly it's
just like mmm feels good to not smell
you like stretch my face out anyway what
am I even talking about so I just adore
her she's very budget-friendly very cost
minded you know what I mean and so I
she's just a happy channel to watch next
is Donna goddess 73,000 subscribers how
many she has Michelle okay she does
these oh she's very inspiring to me she
does these mornings with Michelle like
it's kind of like a chat and I don't
know how often she does them because I
end up I've just gone back and watched
like all of them I think she is one of
the most inspirational people in my
favorite video she did the one that like
sold me on this series and on her
channel and when I hit that subscribe
button was when she did this one about
are you too nice or being too nice and
she was just talking about how I just
got the goose bumps even talking about
this about you know there are some times
you know we misconstrue being nice with
inconveniencing yourself and so I'm
butchering how she said he's got to go
watch I'll link that specific video as
well as her channel below
you've just got to go watch it because
she I want to watch it again now she's
just talking about how you know you'll
because you're so nice you don't want to
inconvenience anyone ever that you start
to inconvenience yourself all the time
and she was just saying how you know you
kinda have to draw a line in the sand
and at a certain point you do need to
look after yourself as well and not that
she's condoning like being selfish it's
if you watch it I think she's so
well-spoken about this issue and I've
never heard anyone talk about that and
that's something I think I suffer from
you know what I mean
anyway go watch the video it's awesome
but I love her channel she also does
some minimalism to cluttery type videos
which I also started watching as well
also as well calm down just but anyway
really really liked the channel really
find her inspiring definitely check her
out next live loves her makeup 72
thousand subscribers she's so cool she's
just like someone I want to know in real
life as well like she again she'll curse
so if you've got little kids that you
don't want to hear it or you don't like
to hear it that's just one thing to know
about her but she's very unapologetic
and it's that's kind of refreshing on
YouTube you know she's kind of one of
those people that inspires me to be a
little less apologetic because there are
certain things if it's my feelings if
it's my opinion on something
why should I have to apologize for that
as long as I'm not intentionally
offending someone if I'm talking about
makeup you know you shouldn't have to be
apologetic and I just think that's so
refreshing to see that she is
unabashedly unapologetic that's too many
ons that you guys get I I just really
like her again we don't always see eye
to eye on products but I never watch her
videos and think oh my gosh I can't
believe she absolutely hated that
product I look like you don't think that
and that's the reality of most of us and
that's I think another reason why I like
watching your channel we don't always
agree on everything but I still love her
honesty Lauren made Beauty here on
YouTube she's got 51 thousand
subscribers I have found her because she
also does like you what does she call
Tube talks so it's like talks about
YouTube the beauty community obviously
there's a trend I like watching these
kinds of videos just because it you know
this has been going on now for years and
now that the dust is settled and this
community has become what it's become
it's interesting too
different kind of sections form of like
the types of beauty you know the types
of beauty youtubers you want to watch
and anyway I love watching her tube
talks so much I'm pretty sure that's how
I discovered her and I just watched lots
of her videos since I just I appreciate
her she's got very different style than
me when it comes to makeup and yet I
still like watching her videos because
her recommendations are always great as
well and again she's just a very honest
person Lisa Stevens she's got 41,000
again she I know used to work at Sephora
and recently quit to do YouTube
full-time which is so exciting and again
she her recommendations are so freakin
good I love her skincare recommendations
more than anything because she's got
such beautiful skin she's a little bit
older than me I'm not sure about how
much but her skin is amazing she's got
amazing recommendations because she has
all that knowledge from working at
Sephora for years so I never miss a
video of hers and she does the clutters
as well and I think that's how I
originally discovered her her her and I
just adore her and then Kaylee bout say
she has twenty four thousand subscribers
she has so many fresh ideas on YouTube
so many fresh ideas
I'm currently amazed she'll put up a
video like you know what I mean and it's
just so cool so I've done a couple of
her videos and I've tried to shout her
out I think there was one video that I
would like felt so bad I'm like I just
didn't realize it was her and anyway but
just such a fresh channel to watch I
really really like her again super chill
super normal you know if you like these
kinds of youtubers you would like her as
well so those are all of the channels
I'm gonna mention I'm like I feel like
that was a lot I know but if you
literally went down the list and
subscribe to all of them you would be
very content there's so many fresh
youtubers out there that aren't being
watched that deserve to be watched
spread the love if you've got a channel
I would love for you to do the same
video I've seen plenty of people do
these kinds of you know share the love
YouTube videos I don't know I've seen so
many I don't know who to shout-out but
definitely do it because I think it's a
cool idea if you have a platform like
this where you can kind of share out
about these kinds of youtubers why not
but if you enjoyed this kind of video
let me know by giving it a thumbs up I
hope
as well to catch more in my videos and
let me know in the comments of course if
you'd like me to do the larger than a
hundred thousand like the bigger
youtubers what who I watch and why I
would be interested in doing that as
well if you guys want to see it I would
also like to know who are these small
channels you guys watch who do you like
for decluttering who do you like for
just like YouTube community talk who do
you like just because their personality
who has the best tutorials you know
those kinds of things I'm interested to
add more to my subscription as I
continually declutter it of people that
either are toxic to me or they're just
ones that I never ever watch their
videos it's such a good feeling to get
rid of those and add in these new people
that have better better content so other
than that I hope you enjoyed now see you
guys bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
