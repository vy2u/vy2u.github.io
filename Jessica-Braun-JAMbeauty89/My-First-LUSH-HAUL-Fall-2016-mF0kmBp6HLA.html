a lush haul my very first I have never
hauled anything from lush on my channel
kind of crazy right the back smells
amazing now the only similar video I've
ever done was a haul from a place called
basin which they have I don't know where
else they have it but they have basin in
two locations in Disneyworld which are
my husband is a Disney travel agent we
go to Disney where all this time I loved
it so I can link that video below if
you'd like this kind of a thing because
I know you can order from them online
they sell amazing bath bombs they sell
like Mickey bath bombs which are so cute
and magical but they also sell amazing
soaps and stuff but this is my first
lush haul on my channel I'm so excited
to share with you guys what I got and
I'm excited to use it all because I've
had it for a few weeks and if you know
anything about YouTube or if you're a
youtuber or whatever you have to wait
especially with lush like you can't use
part of it and then show it like you
need to just wait show it and then juice
it and I'm dying to use it so I am
really excited let's get into this
sucker I have my receipt because without
it I would not know what a lot of this
stuff is called some of this is some of
their classic stuff but I've never tried
it so I'm really excited I'm gonna start
with something that might be useful to
all and it's their dry shampoo this is
called their no drought dry shampoo and
this is their bigger size this was this
was 1595 now the reality is I've tried
some dry shampoos that are even more
expensive than this and it comes with
way less product so the reality is
because this is not an aerosol it's not
a spray you just it's a powder that you
literally put into your hand
I have mark I'm a teacher too if you
didn't know so I've got marker all over
my hand but you literally can get some
in and then you just kind of judge it
into your hair I'm not gonna do it right
now cuz my hair is freshly washed so I
don't really need it right now but
tomorrow morning I will so this is what
I'll be using it has a nice kind of
almost citrusy scent you can get the
smaller size it's gonna last you a
really long time too so you don't have
to commit to the full size I would say
if you're gonna try it for the first
time get the smaller size cuz if you're
not sure that you like it I don't think
it's worth buying the full size
I'm still trying it out I'm gonna be
honest I've tried it a couple times and
I kind of wish I would have gotten this
sighs just to make sure I liked it I'm
still I've used it maybe twice so I
really don't know how I feel about it
it is different you know it is different
you could just kind of get it right into
your scalp or you could do it that way
you can do it either way but of course
you want to kind of comb it out as well
it doesn't make my hair look white which
I appreciate especially since you know
I've been using it by doing it that way
I have used it that way as well and I
still really didn't notice a big white
cast so that is one benefit and it does
smell good so I'll let you know as I
tread this some more how I feel if
you've tried this before let me know
your thoughts down below I'm curious and
I'm sure a lot of people watching are
curious it's like a goodie bag like all
of these things are wrapped so I don't
actually know what they are
oh yes so this is their milky bath
bubble bar this was 795 and it looks
like a little milk jug or milk you know
carton and it's just smells clean I
don't really know how to subscribe it
just smells clean but it's a bubble bar
so you should be able to kind of break
this apart and use some of it to form
bubbles it's really kind of milky and
make sure water creamy and soft I love
this especially if you have hard water
we don't have hard water here but I've
in other places I've lived I've had hard
water and this really does make the
water nice and milky and creamy which is
nice if you're so used to having hard
water in your baths or showers
it is a nice kind of change it is very
luxurious I've been able to break this
into like a ton of pieces and uses so if
you're really skimping and you want to
splurge on it but you want to make sure
you get the most bang for your buck
you'd be surprised into how many pieces
you can get this thing into just so you
know but I'm really excited to use this
up I haven't used the milky bath one
particularly but I know it's kind of one
of their bestsellers this I'm really
excited about and actually my husband
Tyler is very excited about he's like
any fool at videos so we can use that
this I was asking the lady there about
this because I said I want to get
something that both my husband and I can
use and I said my husband's really big
into you know just like if he can do a
two-in-one shampoo conditioner he is all
about it cuz it's quick and she
recommended this this is um there
avvocato co-wash so it's a kinder
and shampoo in one it smells
unbelievable it smells I I just figured
it out
it smells like Pez candy if you've ever
smelled their avvocato co-wash go smell
it if you haven't
it smells like Pez that's what it is it
finally hit me but it literally looks
like a little avocado slice in there
with a little red thing so the idea is
that you can use this as both your
shampoo and conditioner all-in-one I'm
excited to try I've never actually tried
a solid shampoo like this so this is all
new to me my husband is very excited
he's gonna be excited that I'm done
filming this right now because he'll be
able to use it tonight if he wants her
tomorrow that was for the size we got 12
24 so it was a I think pricey hopefully
it'll last a while we're gonna find out
again I'll have to let you know this was
another one that I said that my husband
really likes like citrusy smells as do i
this is their lava-lamp bath bomb it is
humungous this was 795 she said you
can't I smelled it way too hard ah this
is amazing this might be my favorite son
of anything I've ever gotten there I
would like to try and break this into a
couple pieces because it's you know
eight dollars for a bath bomb that's
like way too much like it makes my heart
hurt but I wanted to try it she said
she's not been successful in breaking it
into more than one piece I'm gonna try
so I will let you know how that goes
maybe on my snapchat my snapchat is tmpa
89 kiss you're curious
I'm gonna try I will let you know hot in
comments because that's so much money
for just like one bath like I can't I
can't handle that that's that's like oh
that's to McDonald's meals right there
how it's camping the last thing I picked
up because I was like okay this is all
adding up like way too much I can't get
any more this is another bath bomb I
think or maybe it was a bubble bar I
don't remember what they said this was
but it's in French kiss and it's got
this lavender to it it looks like a
little Hershey's kiss if you will it
smells amazing and again my husband
likes lavender so I was trying to get
things we could both use it does smell
good but it is very lavender II so if
you don't like it smell
you will not like this but it's just so
cute it's got an actual little sprig of
lavender on it and I'm excited to use it
it's very relaxing kind of a scent so
that was everything I got from lush
check out my Basin haul if you like
these kinds of things I'll link it below
as I said and give this video a thumbs
up if you want to see more from lush I
know it's kind of a hit or miss like
some people love it some people don't
care at all about it I'm kind of
in-between like I don't really watch
lush hauls to be honest with you but now
that I've kind of tried a little bit
more I'm a little bit more intrigued I
know I just saw bunny from graveyard
girl I can I always know her name but
not her channel name how was that
possible I don't know I ran into her
once in Disney World and I was so
starstruck I didn't even say hi I know
that's ridiculous but I was just like oh
I didn't say anything
I just always what I'm like that's bunny
that's great for a girl she's like super
famous on YouTube and he was like oh say
hi and I'm like no I can't wait you
nervous Hey like anyone feel me like I
don't care I was so nervous shoot she's
just like chill and cool and crazy and I
love her anyway um but I know she just
did like a Halloween lush haul and I'm
like that makes me want to go back I
haven't watched it yet because I know if
I do I'm gonna want to go back and buy
more and that's bad because it's in my
opinion it's pricey anyway so hopefully
this was enjoyable for you to watch let
me know by giving it a thumbs up I hope
that you'll subscribe before you leave
and I'll see you guys in my next video
