video I'm really like excited to share
with you I learned so much so this video
I saw a youtuber that I just recently
discovered named Kelly Gooch you who
love her she has no idea I'm like
talking about her I don't know if she
knows Graham although I feel like I
heard of her cuz like she comments on a
video and somehow I click through cuz
I'm like I know I don't always comment
back all the time I try feel like I'm
trying to juggle a lot of things in life
but um I read your guys's comments so
and everyone so I'll check out like if
you guys see you have a channel I'll
check it out so anyway however I
discovered her she's awesome I will link
her version of this video and I don't
know she might have been inspired from
another youtuber I don't know but I
loved it and I thought holy moly I want
to see how I haven't told you what am I
talking about today how old my makeup is
so there are two websites she linked I
will link below as well that I use to
discover how old some of my makeup was I
am embarrassed like I'm embarrassed that
I still have some stuff and I've
recently used it so I've corralled it
it's in quarantine and I'm like okay
I've got to really think about like do I
love it enough to buy it again so I'm
gonna tell you I'm going to get rid of
all this stuff except for I think one
item I'm gonna mention that not quite
like there's there are a couple items
that it said like okay you can probably
use it for another year but if you're
wanting to check your old makeup I will
put the links of the two websites below
there are probably more but those were
the two that I used so the way that you
do it is you go to the site and on every
supposed to be and that's something I'll
talk about a second on every makeup item
there should be a batch code sometimes
it's printed really small it could be
like four numbers it could be numbers
and letters like this is really small
just as 3f1 sometimes it's like embossed
or whatever on the actual thing so it's
not actually stamped it's actually like
in it so you just gotta kind of look and
sometimes you'll type in the brand and
they'll like kind of clue you on the
websites to like where to look typically
for the brand Spach code but i found
that some of the things i've ordered
like from mac didn't have a batch code
anywhere on it and I'm like I feel like
that's illegal I don't know I don't know
the law but I feel like that's like
wrong anyway I was just mad cuz I wanted
in a halt it was so let's talk about old
I have it typed into a note because I
was doing this I had so much fun doing
this the other day you guys should
totally do it start with this Too Faced
hangover RX I like this primer a lot and
I've been like oh I'll use it up so I
keep using it and it's actually pretty
close to empty but I've been using it a
lot recently this is from okay keep in
mind the year's 2017 and we're at the
end of 2017 this is from the year 2012
how is this five years old I genuinely
don't know how because I feel like I
bought it
gosh it couldn't have been more than
like two and a half years ago so either
they made it like a million years ago
and it's been sitting and I think I
ordered it from support this was not
given to me in PR I bought it and I feel
like it had to have been like sitting in
a Sephora warehouse for years do you
know what I'm saying so that kind of
turned me off I was like ah and of
course they say some products are fine
if they're not open and it probably is
fine like it still smells normal but
it's kind of one of those things that
I'm like five years is a pretty long
time I'm gonna go ahead and pass this
one on would I buy this again I think
it's a good primer I think it's
moisturizing I like the smell of it do I
think it prolongs the way of my makeup
not as much as other primers so what I
write again probably not but I really
did like it but I just don't feel like I
have a need to have this in my
collection any more if that makes sense
this next one okay I have to be very
honest with you this was a product Ida
cluttered and then I pulled back out of
my declutter pile and kept like bad
that's bad but I did anyway so I've had
it for a long time this is the mac
mineralize skinfinish in the shade soft
and gentle total cult classic which is
why like I do cluttered it and I pull it
back out because I looked at and I felt
guilty I was like no I should have that
it kind of does have a weird feeling to
it now it's a gorgeous highlighter would
I buy it again probably not just because
there are a million highlighters now
that look just like this but at the time
that this was popular there weren't a
lot of products like this and so and it
was a really pretty wearable color for
someone my
skin tone this is from the year it was
made in the year 2011
six years old and it doesn't this
doesn't have a little thing that tells
you how many months but I'm like it's
it's time it doesn't matter it has like
a weird feel on the top now and six
years old is a little bit too old but I
just couldn't believe I still had it and
like I knew it was old but I don't know
when I think of like oh that makeup I've
had for a long time I'm thinking like
two three years I forget that I've had
some of this for that long like I just
feel like time has flown by this one's
going to buy would I buy it again like I
said probably not next one is the Too
Faced shadow insurance and I this was
made in the year 2013 I bought this a
year ago but it's like that means it was
three years old when I got like and
again I don't know exactly the science
behind all this stuff and I am sure that
that's fine for many products but when
it's like a cream I'm putting on my eyes
it makes me nervous and it does say
twelve months so I've probably had it
this particular one a year this is not
the first one I've ever owned but I
probably had this particular one at
least a year so I'm kind of feeling like
maybe I really do love this stuff though
and it's like freaking full so I don't
know I might try it a few more times
just see how it's going but again that
just kind of weirds me out that they sit
that long wherever they're sitting I
don't know like in whatever factory
these aren't like as far as I remember
these aren't like sealed with something
over it I feel like it's just in there
and that's that and it's in a box so the
fact that it's not necesarily seollal
either makes me a little nervous
that's to to face products that were
spending a long time in a warehouse I
don't know and I don't minutes probably
true for like any brand because the
reality is they're not gonna throw away
if they really are fine they're not
gonna throw them away like oh that's
been sitting here let's throw all this
out a new batch I doubt they do that so
I don't know I don't know how they check
on this stuff and see kind of a weird
world if you think about it I've just
never thought about this stuff okay this
is one that I need to
I knew it was getting old because it was
getting weird this is the bare minerals
concealer and well rested I freaking
love this stuff I am definitely buying
again cuz it will be a hole in my makeup
collection but it's kind of a yellow
toned mineral powder concealer but it
freakin brightens your eyes but I hadn't
noticed this stuff felt a little off
lately it's super brightening and it
smells a little off so that is really a
pretty good sign that there's something
wrong but 2013 I'm like alright that's
four years old and I probably had it for
four years open so it's just time but
again like I feel like I just I don't
know I feel like it was like a year and
a half ago that I like discovered it but
it really it was like four years ago
where's Tycho alright next one my NARS
Laguna I finally hit pan on this little
bad boy actually a while ago and so then
I stopped using it like what's wrong
with you you have to go like should use
it up I actually really like this
bronzer it's not a super dark obvious
bronzer at all but for someone my
skintone it's kind of perfect like that
super pricey it's like 40 something
dollars it lasted me a while this
however was from 2014 and that's when I
bought it so that means it's three years
old now on the back it says 24 months so
that means that went bad like a year ago
I kind of thought it was older than that
now powders typically last long like you
know you can as long as there's nothing
weird growing on top of it doesn't smell
awful you can probably get away with
wearing it longer especially since I'm
putting this in areas that are not like
near my eyes or my mouth or something
like that but I feel like I've loved
this enough I have plenty of bronzers
that deserve the love so I think I'm
gonna pass it on I think instead of
buying this one again I would buy these
sun-washed NARS bronzers just because
I've heard amazing things about them I'm
not I've never said sure what the
difference is between those and this
they're the same brand I think they have
a shade Laguna so I don't know if
they're like shimmery versus not sore I
don't know so I'm kind of curious about
those so I am gonna throw this little
bad-boy away but I think if I do buy
another NARS bronzer I'm going to try
the other kind this one doesn't have a
year this is my beloved Benefit box
blush in Dallas looks like a boring
blush I've talked about for years but it
looks amazing on the skin
it looks a lot like what I'm wearing I'm
wearing a Mac blush right now but it
really looks like the same on your skin
I think this one's fine this one is only
from December 2014 so it's going on
three years old but I don't notice that
anything's off with the smell it still
looks nice it still feels nice so I
think I'm gonna hold on to it a little
bit longer than just three year mark
again powders are usually pretty and
it's just my favorite now I would say
maybe by this time next year if I
haven't used it up I'll probably just
purchase a new one I'm so nervous
they're gonna discontinue it I don't
know why because I I worry that not
enough people know about it and then
they'll just continue it so then I'd be
like I needed by for because this is the
best anyway I just absolutely love it so
I am gonna keep this one I would buy it
again regardless if I did get rid of it
whatever the next one is my beloved Marc
Jacobs lipstick I was just curious
because I bought this on my honeymoon
two and a half years ago and it's the
Marc Jacobs Lamarck lip cream in oh my
Lee it's this gorgeous red it's the best
tone of red if you were if I'm wearing
red lips it's usually this I always say
that but it's true
super creamy formula insanely expensive
but it was one of those splurges we were
like in Paris I'm like I'm buying a red
lipstick it's perfect and then it ended
up being absolutely awesome but this was
made in 2014 and I bought it in 2015 so
it tells me that it was at least a year
old already which that's not that crazy
I figure but I'm figuring okay so now
what's going on
three well I guess it's only like three
years old that's not that crazy but I am
thinking about okay like lipstick
doesn't last I mean it lasts decently
well but I've been using it a lot and I
feel like I feel like I I've made a
little bit of a dent in it but I feel
like how have I used it as much as I
have it hasn't gone down but this is one
that I would it would be a hole in my
collection again so maybe in a year or
if I start noticing it going out but
maybe in a year I would just repurchase
it to have a fresh one because I love
this so so much so much so I loved this
video idea I hope you did too if you did
give it a thumbs up definitely subscribe
check out Kel
video like I said I'll link it below
because it's totally what inspired me
and it's just so interesting and I don't
know why like I don't know what you're
supposed to get from this just that
maybe you need to get rid of your makeup
more or maybe that these makeup products
sit on shelves and factories whatever
longer than we think I don't know I
don't know what there is learn from it I
just found it incredibly interesting and
I thought you guys would too
so definitely try it with your own
makeup let me know below what is the
oldest makeup item you found in your
collection and just how old was it I
think that would be so fun to read
through for all of us and like I said if
you want to join our little family here

see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
