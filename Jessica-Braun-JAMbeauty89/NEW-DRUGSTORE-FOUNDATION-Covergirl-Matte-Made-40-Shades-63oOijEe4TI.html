faced because we are going to put on the
new covergirl trublend foundation that
they have in 40 shades which is a big
deal for the drugstore and also some of
their new primers and I don't always do
dedicated reviews to products like this
it well I have it in a long time but I
want to get back into it a and B this is
kind of an exciting range because it's
one of the first times that drugstore
companies have put out a much more
inclusive range of shades in a
foundation often times you can see more
inclusivity in higher end brands because
it does cost more money or so they say
to make the different shades I'm sure it
does but it's exciting that a drugstore
company is doing it because I feel like
that's gonna pave the way for other
drugstore companies to do it because
then it's like well now you have no
excuse to not be doing you know what I'm
saying there never was an excuse but you
know what I mean so I figured I'd just
show you me applying it I've been using
these for the past week so I I do have
pretty finalized thoughts however as I
always say my mind can change as I try
it more and more and more and with
different primers and things so I will
keep you updated on my channel and on my
social if anything changes like my
feelings towards them but I don't know
that it will so we're gonna try two of
these primers today so they have four
primers in the line it's the true blend
based business is what they're calling
the primer line so there's the skin
smoothing which does a great job kind of
smoothing out your face kind of just
feels like a baby's bottom when you use
it in a really nice way then there's the
color neutralizing which kind of has
this greenish hue to it that I've tried
on my nose because my nose tends to be a
little bit more red I feel like it
helped a little bit but not enough that
I feel the need to use it every single
day but if you just generally have
redness on your face it might be worth
trying because I do think it helped tone
it down just a little bit but the two
that I'm gonna be using and my two
favorite in the line are the
illuminating primer and I'm also gonna
use the purple tinted pore minimizing
primer so for the illuminating one this
kind of has like a peachy tint to it and
it definitely has some not glitter by
any means but there's def
a little glow to it so I just applied
this everywhere on my face except for my
nose because that's where I'm going to
put my pore minimizing primer that's
where I feel like I need it I really
like this stuff because we are gonna put
on a matte foundation or at least what
claims to be matte and I feel like this
has done a great job at making sure my
skin doesn't look too dry because I
don't like a super matte look on my face
if you do or if you have oily skin you
probably wouldn't need an illuminating
primer you might want maybe the skins
moving or something else I'm gonna put a
little bit more on cuz again like I said
I really like the way this primer makes
my skin look I like to focus it here cuz
that's where I noticed the most dryness
and I also like to focus it here on my
cheeks just cuz I think it looks really
nice being kind of glowy in that region
again even though it's an illuminating
primer it's not greasy feeling and I
don't feel that it's super greasy
looking either so with the pore
minimizing one I'm just gonna put it on
my nose if you're curious about price of
these I will have prices and links for
everything I mentioned down below as I
always do but I'm just kind of pressing
this onto my nose sometimes I'll bring
it up just a little bit and even
sometimes just throw a little on the
chin even I already put the other primer
on there so again I feel like this does
a good job of kind of filling in any
pores you might have it kind of smoothes
the area like the skin smoothing does
these do have kind of a fresh scent to
them which I don't mind but again if
you're sensitive to fragrance it's not
super strong but you can I mean you
definitely notice it so it's semi I mean
it's there so something else to keep in
mind I always like to mention this scent
alright so shade wise this is it's kind
of ironic that I'm struggling with
finding my shade because their whole
thing with this line is that it is 40
shades and you know anyone can find
their shape well I cannot find my shade
so here are the claims of this
foundation I wanted to read all this to
you that way I can kind of hearken is
that three where hearken back to it is
that a phrase anyway I think
so it says from your favorite covergirl
foundation line comes a matte formula
that isn't drying or cakey true blends
matte maids formula is developed with
flexi hold technology that always makes
me laugh but it what is flexi hold
technology that creates a strong yet
flexible film on skin for durability and
comfort while the mattifying powders
absorb oil and minimize pores for a soft
matte flawless finish up to 12 hours of
wear so 12 hours pore minimizing oil
control transfer resistant 40 shades so
they go much deeper than a lot of skin
care lines foundation line strokes are
foundation wise do however I have heard
some people with much fairer skin than I
talk about how they real it really
doesn't go light enough so that's
something to keep in mind if you've got
ultra fair skin I don't know and maybe
with covergirl being so you know on top
of this inclusion thing right now with
this line you wonder if they'll hear
that and say okay well then let's add
maybe some more here and if there are
any other people that are like oh whoa
I'm on the deep end but there's not
enough cooler deep tones or warmer you
know hopefully they'll listen to us and
add more to the line if they need to
which i think would be really cool
covergirl if you're listening but all of
this was sent to me by the way it's not
sponsored I'm always honest most of the
things I try are sent to me and I tell
you the good the bad the ugly either way
so alright so I I've tried in 15 they
have light medium like tan and deep so
they for kind of ranges within it and
then they have cool tones and warm tones
and neutral humps the only thing I wish
is that they actually labeled it as such
so if they had said neutral 10 or warm 5
they don't so you know you kind of got
to look at it of course in the store
it's hard so if you can swatch it but
some stores have swatch or swatch and
test or some don't it is what it is but
that is something to keep in mind that
it is great to have this range but it's
a little bit harder to navigate if
you're looking for specific undertones
so I have medium 15 which would
typically be way too dark for me but
it's got this really nice neutral tone
that I loved and so I've actually used
this alone and it looked okay which
surprised me because it's much farther
up on
shade range and I'm not you know I'm
decently fair so what I'm gonna do is I
think I'm gonna mix it I also have light
15 and light 20 light 20 is a little bit
it looks like cooler than light 15 so I
think I might mix light 20 and in 15
together I've applied this with a brush
and I've applied it with a sponge and I
feel like it applies the best with a
sponge for me matte foundations can tend
to look really cakey and this one while
I don't think it looked cakey cakey with
a brush I just think it looked more
flawless with a sponge I feel that way
all had a lot of foundations to be
honest with you so if you're you know
one that you really don't like sponges
then use a brush no problem but so I've
got two pumps of the m15 and one pump of
the l20 it doesn't matter cuz none of
you guys are my exact skintone I'm sure
but if you are so yeah this is kind of
creating like a perfect kind of neutral
foundation for me but anyway so got
those primers on let's go ahead and
start applying I'm just using a L'Oreal
sponge actually it's a pretty good match
dang Jess what are you a mixologist to
something so I feel like coverage wise
my hair keeps getting in there it
covered a lot of my freckles I mean a
lot it's kind of crazy and you can
definitely build this up I realized I
would call this medium coverage just
flat out but you really can build it
I've learned as I've tried it more to be
more than that which is cool because
that gives you the option I think like
for me I prefer a medium coverage I feel
like that's enough for my skin can still
breathe but it's not I don't know it
doesn't look dead but it's also covering
some nice parts of my skin it just kind
of needed covered I'm already out of
foundation though that's crazy I used
three pumps so I don't know if that's my
own sponge you know what I mean but it's
just something to be aware of that I
feel like as it spreads with the sponge
it just really either is soaking into
the sponge
into the my skin but even still I feel
like I never use this much foundation
with other brands I don't know maybe I'm
in my head about it regardless
here it is on my skin I think it looks
really nice guys I was really impressed
with this foundation I have not found a
covergirl foundation I've loved i tried
their one with the blue cap that so many
people loved and i liked it it was okay
I haven't had that one in a while it was
too much for my skin it was too dry I
felt like it made my skin break out I
just feel like my skin doesn't react
well to them and this is the first one
I've tried where I was like I feel like
it looks nice I really really do I feel
like it stays on pretty well throughout
the day the only thing I've noticed
that's really weird is that I will and
it has to be this foundation and if you
can enlighten me as to what you think it
is or maybe you know what it is every
time I apply this I have these little
white dots and they'll they'll brush
right off but I don't know I'm like is
that something in the foundation is it
like little powder particles they're not
glittery at all but every time I apply
it no matter what I'm using to apply it
I always have little white dots that I
kind of have to brush away what is that
can someone help us and then we can
thumbs up whoever knows and so everyone
can know in the comments because I'm so
curious not enough that it really
bothers me it's just kind of odd I've
never had a foundation like that so
coverage wise I think it's really nice
like I explained earlier where time is
pretty darn good this wears really well
throughout the day I've not noticed it
breaking apart in the normal places my
foundation breaks apart like on my nose
now it is allergy season so for me I'm
itching my nose it's anything I'm
wearing no matter what it is breaks a
part of my nose during allergy season
because I'm itching it and trying not to
touch it but you need to touch it so I
feel like it's it's hard to test it at
this season of my life like literally
this allergy season but what I've
noticed is it really stays on really
really well it doesn't break apart weird
here which usually you know I've got
little bits of fine lines usually
foundation as well and it doesn't so I
just I like it and I'm so glad that I do
because you know it is more inclusive
and I know that they do have some barren
spots to fill on the lighter end etc but
I think they're doing something
right here and I don't want us to forget
that because it's easy for us to get
excited about something like this I
don't know how to put this into words
and then all of a sudden I already see
people tearing it down I've seen this on
Twitter of like well they don't have
this shade range of oh I'm like they're
doing something good
we need to applaud them for that be
excited about that
know that it's sparking hopefully other
change in other companies and then let
covergirl fill in the blanks with any
shade ranges they might be missing
things like that now I would love if
covergirl came out with a more luminous
version because I just love luminous
foundations now again I feel like with
their primer it actually didn't turn out
super matte anyway if you put on a
regular primer it definitely looks more
matte but it's not so mad that your skin
feels like the life sucked out of it so
if you have skin like my normal to dry
put a moisturizing primer on underneath
it doesn't have to be cover girls
although I do like it or maybe use a
facial oil underneath whatever and then
go in with it and if you've got really
skin then use your normal primers you
like like ones that are oil controlling
and then use this and you're gonna have
that really nice matte look but I feel
like the way I did it gives it more of a
satin look so I didn't really talk about
the packaging but it is really nice it's
their normal Foundation packaging with
the comp which I love love love love
pumps so all in all I would give this
like a four and a half out of five I
think shape range is great packaging is
great it's a nice wearable foundation
but it really does like I feel like my
skin looks its best to be honest with
you and of course once I get concealer
and everything else done but I hope this
review is helpful I don't know if it was
weird to look at me like half ready the
entire time but there you are but other
than that if you're curious I'm actually
today trying out a whole slew of my
tables filled with a bunch of new
drugstore makeup from different brands
so I'm doing a get ready with me as as
we speak that I will also have up on my
channel if it is up I will put the link
below if not subscribe stay tuned check
that out because there's a lot of new
exciting things I haven't heard anyone
talk about that I wanted
try with you guys so I hope you enjoyed
the video and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
