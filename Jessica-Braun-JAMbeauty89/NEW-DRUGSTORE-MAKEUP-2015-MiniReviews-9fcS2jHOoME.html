you guys this is the first time in a
very long time that I have gone out and
just bought a ton of things to review
because I feel like to be completely
honest with you guys I feel like I've
been so caught up in my first year of
teaching that I really have neglected my
channel by way of reviews like I've done
tons of subscription box and boxing's
I've done tons of you know things like
that but I really have not done a lot of
like just pointed reviews on like one
product at a time I usually will just do
like a you know video with a bunch of
different reviews inside of it like a
favorites video and things like that but
I do you know the reason I started my
channels because I wanted to do reviews
so I wanted to make sure that I am
staying true to why I started my channel
here in 2015 so I am sick still I will I
have been sick for a thousand years it
feels like um that's all right so I have
a ton of stuff face things blush tons of
lip products so every single thing I
show you in here will have a review I've
already filmed some of them some of the
reviews which is exciting because I've
gotten to play with them and I just love
them already in some I already know that
I don't so they'll be many reviews in
this video let's go ahead and get
started the first thing I bought was
this wet Wild Fergie blush now I got it
in the shade brush with destiny and it's
this really pretty peach shade and it's
got a little bit of shimmer to it and
it's really beautiful I'm wearing it
today you don't need to highlight with
it I love it so much here's a swatch of
the blush I just think it is so pretty
and shimmery I love it and it's like
five dollars so I was really excited
about that one another thing I picked up
is the L'Oreal infallible makeup
extender setting spray and it sprays
really evenly um it just it seems to be
really nice so far but I want to try it
a few more times before I review it uh
okay I also picked up the fit me
concealer and I got it
like Ted and I've heard a lot of people
talk about this being a dupe for the
NARS creamy concealer which I also own
so I'm excited to kind of compare these
two and see how I like it I'm wearing it
today and it seemed to cover pretty well
it did settle into fine lines a little
bit so that's the one may notice thing
I've made with it
I also speaking of concealer I have not
tried this yet this is the wet and wild
cover all liquid concealer wand it's the
same kind of setup as the fit me one but
it's seems to be a little thinner than
the fit me let me compare so that was
the cover all under the fit me one same
kind of applicator okay so the fit me is
more yellow toned and then the wet and
wild cover all has a little more of a
pink undertone so but let's just show
them blend it out this is the fit b1 and
this is the wet and wild one I mean they
both seem to blend nicely the fit me one
feels a little creamier than the other
one I have a feeling that cover all
might be drying but I don't know I
haven't tried it yet so I've also picked
up the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation this I'm wearing today I hit
the shade I got is way too dark I
realized as I filmed first impressions
of this I got in the shade 103 natural
buff but when I they had a one oh I
think it was I guess it was 102 it was
open so I was like well if it's already
old but I'm just gonna try so I saw him
like well that's way too light but then
this one they didn't have any of these
open so I didn't want to be the one to
open it so I just bought it thinking oh
it'll probably be fine way too dark I'm
wearing today it works okay but you can
see the difference you know so I guess I
should get the next shade out even
though I feel like it was too light but
at least if it's too light I can use
bronzer and kind of like darken it up
myself whereas if it's already too dark
there's really not much you can do
unless you mix it but I so far really
like the formula of this a lot so stay
tuned for a review on this one I got
three other foundations these I have not
tried yet so this is the fit me but it's
the new matte and poreless foundation so
it's for normal to oily skin
I got at the shade 112 natural ivory
which i think is actually a pretty good
match for me and I really excited I hate
the packaging that it's there's no pump
and it's not a squeezy two because it's
just it just gets so messy but so that's
one thing I picked up I also in the same
type of packaging pick up the Rimmel
lasting finish 25 hour foundation
I got it in 101 classic ivory now this I
think is the same thing that used to be
in the squeezy tubes that I used to love
and I swear like no one liked it and I
loved that foundation it smells the same
as that did it's got a certain smell not
a bad smell but a very specific smell
and I loved that stuff it's like the
perfect satin finish so if this is the
same I'm going to be very excited that's
all just I'm excited and the other
foundation that I got or kind of
foundation this is the Rimmel BB cream
matte now I have tried just the regular
Rimmel BB cream and I did not like it my
skin was such a greaseball like it was a
mess on me so that one I ended up
returning a very long time ago
but I'm interested in trying the matte
to see if I like it I still have not
found a BB cream that I love like
straight up really have it
this isn't interesting purchase this is
the Revlon Photoready eye art duo thing
and it's got this like cream shadow type
thing on one side where it's um like
this really pretty shimmery creamy but
almost creamier than a cream shadow if
that makes sense and this by the way is
in the shade topaz twinkle and then it
also has this like glitter liner that's
got like a brush wand but you can also
put it and this is what I did on my eyes
today and in the review video that you
will see I show you how I apply it where
I do this first and the glitter all over
the top it is amazing it stays on all
day I really like the look at gifts I
want to go back and get like they have a
green one so stay tuned for a review on
this as well but in the meantime if you
see a sale you will love it go ahead and
get it I'm telling you right now but
just get one and see how you like it
but it's so it's so awesome okay so now
on to the lips oh my gosh so these are
the Fergie wet and wild velvet
matte lip colors and I got plum Janu and
then I also got pinky candy and plums a
new I like the best out of the two but
I've already filmed the review on this
it
they're terrible I'll tell you right now
they're terrible don't waste your money
they're like a crayon they they just
kind of you know they look okay in a
swatch but it's kind of it skips around
a little bit kind of splotchy the actual
thing like has been falling out of here
now it's not of course so that's good
though
but on both of them the actual like
lipstick or whatever you want to call it
like fell out like what so cute
packaging and pretty inexpensive like
349 except for it's terrible and it
looks like a kool-aid state on your lips
and not in a good way it's just say oh I
stay away from that if you're going to
get something from the Fergie line get
this blush okay so continuing on with
lips I also picked up two of the rim
will show off lip Velvets and I picked
up atomic rose which is like a peachy
shade I know I haven't swatched
everything because these will all be
reviewed but I'll swatch some of them so
that's atomic rose and then I love this
one this one is meteoric matte and if
you're looking for a beautiful matte
berry color this is my absolute favorite
it's like a more like berry but it's
like a blue toned red it's so so pretty
love love love this stuff the next thing
I picked up with these Milani brilliant
shine lip glosses and first of all I
love the packaging on these you guys I
wanted to buy like a thousand but I only
bought two because I was like what if I
hate it like I don't want to buy a bunch
but I want it for all of these since I
know I'm gonna do review videos on all
of them I wanted to make sure I had at
least two shades I'm trying not to buy
too many of any one thing because really
you can usually tell how you'd feel
about a product when you try two
different shades because you don't
really have to try seven shades to know
if the formula differs too much so I
think that too is solid I don't need
that many so I picked up pink lady and
then I also got bare secret bear secret
is one that I have never
like it's kind of a brownish praline
kind of color and I usually don't go for
these but I don't know like I've been
wanting to get some more like not even
like the mauve color that would like
that mess up marsala color that's an cut
in like the color of the year whatever
not that one but more like a toffee
color because I just want to try more
stuff like that I don't I always go like
the berry route or I go like a ma route
or pink but I really rarely do like a
toffee color so trying to branch out I
really like bare secret and then the
pink lady one these are just sheer
glosses I mean there is some color but I
really like these they smell nice again
there will be a review on these but I
just think they're nice and there's cute
packaging and they're not too expensive
so I these this might be something I
might go back out and get more of I
don't know but I really really like them
I also picked up two of the covergirl
these new covergirl see I don't even
know what line it is but it's those new
ones that they have like the bright pink
packaging in the purple and like the red
I only picked up two colors I got
ravishing Rose which is this really
pretty these are kind of metallic frosty
looks which really I don't have a lot of
metallicky shades in my collection if
like any so I think it's good to have at
least a few options in that regard and
these are pretty inexpensive and this
shade is delicious which is more of a
purpley tone so I think delicious is a
lot less frosty but they're they're
beautiful they smell nice they're very
creamy so so far I like them I haven't
gotten to wear them out yet though and
the last thing I picked up during this
redonkulous haul were three of the
Jordana modern matte lipsticks and these
are okay they're like 249 and I got what
is this called matte popular which is
this bright pink and then I got matte
sorry they all have matte the name matte
blush which is this again like a toffee
color since I'm trying to branch out
and for 249 I mean it's not like I'm
breaking the bank it's not that
expensive and then my favorite out of
these which is mad at girl which is like
more of us or i'm swatching in weird
locations more of a purplish fuchsia
berry I just named like ten different
colors but but they're all they're
pretty good and for 249 you can't beat
em are they my favorite matte lip
product in the universe no but for 249
if you're just getting into makeup or
you're wanting to kind of expand your
color repertoire and get some colors
that you know you probably won't wear a
lot but you want to at least have to
wear sometimes I think this is a good
option but again I'll have a review
video up on these soon as well let me
know what you would like to review first
like I said I've reviewed some of these
already some of my did first impressions
I've like got lip swatches for some of
them already done so they'll all be kind
of coming up periodically so definitely
check back subscribe if you're
interested um yeah I guess I'll just
shut up and I don't get you guys soon
bye my next one is regards to
sponsorships so many people have
questions about sponsorships a
sponsorship is when a company contacts
you and basically says if you will
review this product or show this product
in your video usually it depends on
whether they want you to show it or then
use it in a video whatever but they'll
outline that and they will say we will
pay you this amount of money it could be
a lump sum sometimes it might be based
on how many views you get etc now a
sponsorship you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
