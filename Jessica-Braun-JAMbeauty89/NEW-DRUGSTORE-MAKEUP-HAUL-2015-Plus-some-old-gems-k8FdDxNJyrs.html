have another humongous drugstore haul
and I have no excuse
none no that's not true my excuse is
that I would like to review these for
you guys and for myself but for the
benefit of everyone I went shopping at
the drugstore so if you haven't seen my
first video where the first haul is way
bigger than this one I can link it below
it was like within the past few weeks
where I hauled a ton of new drugstore
lip products that I was going to review
and oh my god it's just tons of stuff
tons of foundations and all kinds of
things and I also have a bunch of
reviews up on a lot of those products so
I will link those below if you're
interested definitely check them out
because the first haul is way bigger
than this one although this one's pretty
big too so let's start with some face
stuff that I got the first thing that I
picked up recently was the NYC BB cream
instant matte now what is so cool about
this is that they had already had I
didn't even realize this NYC it already
had a BB cream out but this is now
they're like matte version this is
awesome you guys it's 399 and I I did a
demo with this and then the elf BB cream
kind of comparing them seeing the pros
and cons of both in a video which I can
link below as well and I loved both but
this one is amazing for oily skin and I
know a lot of people have trouble
finding BB cream from oily skin because
so many BB creams are so oily and that's
the same for I don't even have oily skin
and I have problems with BB cream the
same issues so this is an amazing option
and it actually has a decent amount of
coverage to it it's not I mean it's not
a foundation it's not gonna have
foundation coverage but it does mattify
and it does cover a little spot I was
amazed of course they only have like a
few colors in the range
I bought the lightest one which is in
0-1 light I loved it I highly recommend
it check out the video if you're
interested to see how it looks on the
skin okay so the next thing I picked up
I was very excited about because forever
I have loved my wet and wild color icon
reserved your Cabana like as a highlight
but these are technically bronzers
though they're marketed as such so I
finally picked up another one and this
is in the shade ticket to Brazil and
just a really pretty kind of golden e
bronze but it is still a lighter bronzer
and for me I've got really fair skin I
was so excited to find something that
you know it looks really nice and bronzy
but it's nothing too crazy so like for
me on my skin tone that I mean it's so
Orange but I just think it's gonna look
really nice so I'm really excited for
the warmer months to come so I can give
this a try
another product that I picked up is this
elf blush and it was I want to say two
dollars although I thought the
essentials line is usually one but it
was two dollars and I found it at
Walmart it's in the shade coy and it's
again a bronzer shade even though it's
marketed as a blush and it's kind of got
this greyish tone to it and I was so
excited because there's so little of
this especially in you know inexpensive
products oh my gosh it's so so pretty so
you could use as the bronzer as a blush
kind of depending on your skin tone but
it's so buttery and nice and I was
floored so I am so excited I feel like I
could get away with using this as a
contour powder if I wanted its bronzer
II and I don't know you could use it
both ways although looking at it here in
this swatch it looks more bronze rebut
it is so pretty and it's two dollars and
I couldn't believe how nice it was okay
the next product I picked up okay I want
to eat some products to do some cream
contouring with and so I looked at like
the stick foundations and stick
concealers in the makeup aisle to see if
there was something I could just get a
darker skin tone one and use that well
this was the darkest one they had and
the fit me foundation sticks from
Maybelline so I got it in toffee caramel
and it's I mean I don't know I tried it
once and I'm like this is way too orange
I need one that's more again more gray
toned so I don't know I like I said this
is the darkest one they had there all
the rest were sold out so I don't know
if if I go back or if I go to another
one I can maybe find one that is less
orange toned but I just kind of giggled
at that so I've only used it once I'm
going to keep trying it I could just use
it as a cream bronzer here and you know
you can blend
out to look really really nice so I just
need to mess with it a little bit more I
will say though when I did use it I even
said it with like a bronzing powder on
top of a contouring powder and it still
was like gone by the end of the day so I
don't think I would ever use this is
supposed to be a foundation stick like
for your face I would never use this all
over my face like no way it would be a
mess by the end of the day so not sure
how that would be used but for that it's
alright the next product I picked up
finally is the Maybelline matte lipstick
in lust for blush you guys know how
obsessed I am with the maybelline color
whisper and lust for blush because it's
this like light purplish pink and it's
just so beautiful and natural on the
lips and moisturizing it's my favorite
it's like I'm pretty sure when I went
through my declutter recently here on
YouTube when I decluttered those I think
I got rid of all of them but the lust
for blush because it's the only one I
just loved so I'm so excited to finally
have this I actually I actually I
actually have not worn it yet but it's
this really it's a lot darker than the
color whisper is that is for sure but
it's such a pretty color and these the
matte formula of these lipsticks is
absolutely amazing so I love it I love
it so much so excited to wear that okay
the next lipstick I bought is another
matte one you see a trend and this is
the Milani matte blissful and this is
one that I was nervous because the
Milani lipsticks of their normal line
has that smell to him that makes me sick
and I had to get rid of my Milani
lipsticks cuz I couldn't wear them like
it genuinely made me sick but these have
a totally different smells it's honestly
almost like a non-existent smell but
maybe a little hint of vanilla a little
bit of a sweet smell but this is in the
shade matte blissful like I said and
it's just this gorgeous pink you guys I
mean this is so pretty it's so creamy I
I can't even decide which matte formula
I like better than Maybelline or the
Milani cuz they're both so beautiful and
so amazing but this color is so gorgeous
all the rest of these are lip products
as we're going so just so you know the
next thing I got was this revlon
colorburst matte balm this is the very
first matte one I've ever bought I don't
know how that's possible that I tried so
many of these and in the end got rid of
a lot
these as well and I hadn't tried a matte
one so I ended up picking out the shade
sultry and it's just this really I mean
it's certainly matte certainly creamy
just a deeper color than I would
typically wear but I figure you know
I've got a lot of these light matte
colors that I might as well get a deeper
one in this and these of course smell
like mint they're really really nice
they're they really are nice it's just
it was one of those products that when I
did do my declutter I got rid of I think
in the past I had already gotten rid of
a decent amount of them just because I
wasn't reaching for him and some of them
would slip around my lips but the matte
one seemed really really nice okay I
also got a Milani lip liner these are so
cheap these are like three or four
dollars and someone here in YouTube had
mentioned that they love this it's in
the shade spice and I think the you know
Milani always has the cute gold
packaging but this is just a really
honestly it kind of looks like that
matte balm did but a little bit browner
a really nice Brown toned lip liner and
I just I don't know if spice is such a
good name for it the next two products I
purchased were lip glosses and I was
clearly at Walmart because both of these
brands are only sold at Walmart so the
first one I picked up was from flower
beauty and I own very few flower beauty
products one is the lip liner I liked
that a subscriber sent me and I that
actually might be it so I really truly
do not own much but I've heard good
things so this is the well it's in the
shade pink about me and it's one of
their lip glosses this is one that they
have like sheer ones and then they have
ones that are like more of a lip lacquer
that are a lot more opaque and this is
one of the more opaque ones like I said
it's in the shade pink about me and it's
just this really beautiful like nudie
pink but it actually like coats your
lips in that color it is truly opaque
it's also really emerged not shimmery
shiny still but it does I mean your lips
become that color and I think it's so
pretty it's kind of more of that you
know when people used to be in a really
nude lips it reminds me of that but I
really don't have anything like that and
I just think it's pretty plus look at
this flippin packaging it is the
prettiest most high-end looking
packaging I've ever seen the main
downside I found with this as I've worn
it over the past week or so is that it
does have a really strong flower scent I
don't know you guys tell me are all of
the flower products
scented florally because you know that
can get really overwhelming really
quickly and this one certainly has a
very floral scent so it not enough that
it bothers me to not wear it not as that
as those Milani ones did but it is
noticeable so if you know you hate
floral I would say at least from this
stay away from this but it's so pretty
the last thing I got was from hard candy
and this is their plumping serum
volumizing lip gloss I got mine in the
shade girl-next-door and its sheer and
the one thing I'm noticing is it already
looks like it's separating and I don't
know if that's because I've only used it
once or if it's just been sitting on the
shelves for all you guys see that but
it's a really pretty color so color wise
it really is just more of a sheer wash
of color it does have a little bit of a
pink tint to it but not really it's
supposedly plumping but it doesn't give
my lips that plumping feeling that a lot
of them like a lot of plumping wants to
do it doesn't really give it that and I
don't notice that they're plumper but
it's a really nice color to throw on top
of a bolder lip because it it tones it
down just a little bit adds a really
nice Sheen and I like it what does it
have a smell no it really doesn't have a
smell which is good so when I go back
and buy more probably not although I
would be interesting interested to try
some other because they have a few lines
of lip gloss I'd be interested to try a
few others could save some really
interesting colors so I might get some
more hard candy ones let me know what
you're I'm actually curious what you're
a flower beauty and hard candy favorites
are because I would love to try some
more maybe do some reviews but I almost
feel like no one talks about them enough
so I feel like I don't really know and
so let me know down below if you have
some favorites from either one of those
lines because I'm certainly curious and
they're pretty inexpensive
comparatively especially the hard candy
so hopefully that was fun for you guys
to watch and gave you some ideas of some
new products that are out there some of
them aren't even new but they're just
products that have been out there that
for me I don't know why I hadn't tried
them like the the Milani lip liner and
spice is so nice
this elf blush and coy and I I would
guess any of these in this packaging
you're going to be really nice so there
are just some amazing products out there
both new and ones that have been there
for a long time if you're interested in
my drugstore haul that I had filmed a
few weeks ago with tons of brand new
products that are out I will link it
below as I had mentioned earlier please
subscribe if you'd like to see more and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye I
know into the shade reserved your Cabana
and of course it's marketed as a bronzer
but really it's a highlight and what is
amazing about it is that it's just this
beautiful sort of shimmery but mostly
just satin type color and you can't
really see it but I'm wearing it today
on my face and I just love it because it
is just very subtle it doesn't look like
a disco ball on your face you can't
really go wrong with it and it also has
SPF night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
