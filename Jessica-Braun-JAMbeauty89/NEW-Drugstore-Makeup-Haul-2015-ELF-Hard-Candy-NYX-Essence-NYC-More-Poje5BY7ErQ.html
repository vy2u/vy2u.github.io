have a humongous drugstore haul let's go
ahead and get started so that this video
is not a thousand years long okay so the
first thing in front of me that I'm
really really excited about I went to
Walmart and I never go I shouldn't say
never I don't go there that often and I
went specifically because I'd watched a
few videos on YouTube about people
talking about new hard candy products
one of which was Terra babies did I say
that you can say that right I love her
her YouTube channel and she recently did
a haul and I literally wanted everything
she's watched everything and I was like
I want all of it but I there were a few
things I found that I actually genuinely
did want that I bought
so from hard candy the brand she had
mentioned this blush and it's one of
their ombre blushes and it's in the
shade punch and it literally is a blush
that is ombre I mean it's like this
light this darker pink that fades in to
a light pink
you could either she swatched it she was
so smart about the way she swatched it
like with an ombre effect just one way
so it'd be like it'd be as if you had
the highlight in the blush going on all
at the same time or you could just swirl
it together which I'm sure is how I will
use it and it's just a really pretty
light metallic pink I am so excited
because when I'm gonna rush in the
morning I like to wear highlight
everyday I just like highlighters I
think and I don't really wear like crazy
glittery ones obviously for every day
but I do like a little bit of glow so
when I when I've got a blush that's got
it built in that is the most exciting
thing in the world to me and it's not
it's metallic but it doesn't look like
glitter to me so that is exciting also
I've never showed this to you but when I
wipe off swatches I don't like to wait
waste makeup wipes so I'll just use baby
wipes that I bought at Big Lots like two
bucks this is frozen and it has a LOF on
it I just wanted to share that although
these baby wipes kind of suck they're
like ripping apart they're probably old
which is probably why they were at Big
Lots but anyway um I just figured that
was worth mentioning because frozen is
the best thumbs up if you love Disney
movies even if you're an adult I have no
children and no excuse but I watched his
movies all the time so very excited
about this blush all of the heart
products for under $10 I want to say
this was like seven or eight I'll try
and get links for every single thing I
mentioned down below okay the next thing
this I've heard no one talked about it
when I saw this for $8 at Walmart my jaw
hit the floor it's a pallet and it's
from hard candy they had three different
types I bought this one called natural
eyes they had like smokey eyes and then
they had like playful eyes or something
else the smokey eyes was the typical
like blues and grays and stuff that I
don't really wear and then the playful
one really just I don't remember it was
some colors but nothing too crazy and it
just didn't appeal to me but this one
look at these colors I haven't swatched
them yet I literally just came back from
the store aren't you so excited about
these colors now first of all it's eight
dollars and the packaging feels pretty
much like the two-faced ones that are
like that metal it's not as nice but it
is magnetic and I mean it's got a mirror
and some instructions but it comes with
a little eye primer here a little sponge
tip applicator a little tiny eyeliner
that says take me out liner in black and
then it's got these nine shadows so
let's let Nexus watch oh geez and here
they are up close they feel so smooth
these are so pretty oh my gosh I have to
admit I'm surprised because I'd heard
kind of mix things about hard candy eye
products and that's why I've never
bought them but when I saw this I really
felt like I couldn't pass it up and I am
I would have to assume that they have
improved their eyeshadow formula tenfold
and this is so impressive they're so
velvety smooth I mean I'm just shocked
it's got four matte colors these three
are matte and then this one which will
probably be my most you shade is also
matte and the rest of them are shimmery
they're all so beautiful and by I mean
it feels like the Too Faced shadows you
guys know I love my Too Faced natural
eyes palette in fact I wonder if this is
supposed to be a dupe dead on dead on oh
my gosh I'm so excited to show this
year's
so here's the two-faced one here is the
hard candy one you'll see there's the
matte ones on the side with the shimmery
one in between on this side here and I
mean it's supposed to be a dupe now not
all the colors are perfect but you can
tell like there's even over here this
like brown shadow with gold and shimmer
in this chocolate martini on the to face
is the same I mean it's supposed to be a
dupe this is so exciting for me because
I know that I mentioned this all the
time and I know it's not cheap I know
it's $36 I think and that's why you know
knowing that I love drugstore as much as
I do and I don't make a lot of money
either
I hate mentioning this too much because
I know it's expensive this is so
exciting and it's so buttery so I can't
wait to like truly try this some more I
might let me know if you're interested
in like a true dupe video between these
where we compare swatches this is so
exciting to me and it's eight dollars oh
my gosh okay the next thing I got from
hard candy is one of their highlights in
it's one that everyone has been
mentioning for years it's in the shade
Tiki and their packaging is really cute
and really nice and this is a giant
giant highlight now when I first there
was one open to the store that had
already been swatched and typically I'm
like huh but I was like well it's
already open and it's already swatch I
mean it was messed up I was like dang
somebody sucks but I was like well it's
already open I - let's watch it so I did
and it is at first I was like I don't
think so like I'm really fair but when I
put it on my hand I saw that like it
blends to the most beautiful just
glimmery highlight but it works like it
doesn't look glittery it just looks
glimmery I'm wearing it today I love
this like I love this and a lot of baked
products always feel kind of dry and
gross to me but this one doesn't feel
dry the way that some of the elf baked
products do this one feels soft for a
baked product and I know that sounds
dumb but it bothers me when it feels all
like
but this one doesn't and I was so
excited so that I am really excited to
use some more the next thing I got this
was $7.00 and it is a new foundation
from a hard candy which I've never tried
their foundation and it is the hard
candy glamoflauge invisible camouflage
foundation I got it in the lightest
shade 930 porcelain they had one another
lighter shade that was like one step up
and it was very pink tone and this one's
more yellow tone and I do it's funny
because I'm Irish but I'm also Native
American and so I am very fair-skinned
but my skin is kind of yellow tone and
it's taking me a long time to kind of
realize that that you know when I look
in the mirror when I'm trying a new
foundation like why doesn't this work
this looks weird it's because it looks
too pink on my skin and so it's not
matching my yellowish tone skin down
here even though I'm really fair it's
taking me forever to figure that out but
I finally figured it out so I went with
the more yellow toned one and I haven't
tried it yet but I will say this it
feels kind of I mean it's made of thick
plastic so it doesn't feel super
high-end
but it has a pump you guys it has a pump
I was so excited like the pump is worth
seven dollars alone let alone happened
Asian Isle of Palms and I had a lovely
subscriber send me these ones that I can
put my foundation in and I've got three
of them she sent and I haven't filled
anything in him yet because I'm trying
to decide which three that I want to do
it I
I have a Rimmel one that I am wearing
today that I I can't believe how amazing
it is it's the 25 hour one and I think
that will be one that I put in here
anyway
so I got it in 930 porcelain and I
haven't even squirted this out yet
so let's see sure I've got to get it
prime oh okay so it's kind of a I don't
know oh it's very thin I feel like
that'll be a good match for me though
thank goodness
it feels very some silicone II soft like
insanely velvety smooth and it certainly
made my skin on my hand look like
flawless girl your hands look
that is kind of a good feeling I'm
hoping it doesn't like break me out or
do anything weird like that let me know
for this entire video if there's
anything you want a full review on you
know hop the way I do my reviews I
typically do a demo like of me applying
it and then I talk about all the pros
and cons of everything to do with the
product so let me know if you'd be
interested in this because for $7 with a
pump I mean now I will say this if you
are a darker-skinned gal they have
nothing for you I laughed and then
scoffed when I saw that they had like
maybe six or seven shades but the
darkest was like not dark at all I'm
like seriously they didn't even try it
was just weird it anyway so I am excited
though about this because it feels
amazing and it looks really pretty so
I'm gonna be trying this tomorrow
morning okay so moving on to the next
brand some NYC things that I picked up I
finally Holly eats lipstick here on
YouTube who I adore she she's just so
chill and if you she does tons of
drugstore videos which of course that's
one big reason why I like her but she's
just chill I don't really know how to
describe it she talks about I I'm pretty
sure it's the NYC one this is the NYC
smooth skin loose face powder +
translucent she's fair like I am I think
she's more fair than I am but she said
she swears by this I hope it's the NYC
what she was talking about this was like
two or three dollars so I'm excited I
don't have any translucent powders in
fact I don't know that I've ever used
them I've been very like about it my
entire life I don't know why it seems
very old-fashioned to me but it kind of
in a cool way so I'm excited to give
this a shot let me know if you have
tried this and how you like it the other
NYC product I got was the NYC eye line
liquid eyeliner in just black and I
haven't even opened this yet this again
is so inexpensive it's a brush tip so
it's not a felt tip it's a true brush
Wow that is black but you do have to
read it cuz the second time like right
away it's like gray you know what I mean
I have a feeling this brush we get it's
already gotten wonky but it is crazy
black this is the kind of eyeliner
though that I don't think would work
well if you're a beginner or
like the elf intense ink eyeliner has a
felt-tip now this is really thick but
the tip is thin enough and the brush
doesn't really gets played so you can
get really I feel like you can be really
controlled with the Alpha and whereas
with the NYC one you have to be a little
more careful because it is a brush and
it can go fling and get all over but I'm
excited to try it I think I've gotten
decent and eyeliner you guys know I'm
not a makeup artists I just love makeup
so I think I've gotten decent and
eyeliner so I'm excited to give that a
shot and again it was like two or three
dollars so cheap the next thing I got it
was another Holly it's lipstick thing
darn it Holly this is the Maybelline
master prime primer and it's the
original blur and smooth formula they
have a green one and they also have like
an illuminating one and I got this one
and I haven't tried it yet so it's a
white cream and it kind of blends out to
be really oh like velvety feeling
reminds me of the Smashbox one so I'm
excited to give this a try and see how I
feel about it
by the way this is my natural hair and
every time I wear this wait I there's
like why don't you wear it like that all
the time I'm like because I don't know
what to do with this so oh my gosh
there's so much here I've got some NIC
stuff some Milani sand trying to glaze
some Rimmel some elf some Pacifica and
some essence so that's what you've got
coming up if you're still watching and
you're still interested so the Milani I
only bought one of these now these are
the Bella eyes and a lot of people have
been sent these I got I want to say that
I got one or two in like a boxycharm or
something but they were broken or I gave
him away I don't even remember at the
time I just wasn't interested so I
didn't even open them cuz I mean I've
got tons of makeup but then I heard
everyone's talking about him I'm like
dang like I feel like I'm left out so
they're not that expensive I mean I want
to say they're like four dollars so I
just bought one to give it a try because
I wasn't even sure like what the formula
was like so I picked out Bella sand and
it's just a really nice you know kind of
baiji gold color I've been wearing it
since I'm so fair in my crease a lot and
it doesn't do anything dramatic but it's
so nice for just that everyday I don't
no like it just looks nice and every
time I've worn it I've gotten
compliments and it certainly doesn't
budge throughout the day so I really
like it I don't know that the formula is
like I mean this is the only one I've
tried so I don't know it's great but I
don't think it's like anything different
than anything really you know what I
mean it's good so the next thing I got
is from ELF and it's the elf glitter
primer and this section on clearance at
Target for like a dollar fifty instead
of three dollars or instead of two
dollar you know whatever it was but
either way it would be I'm sure under
three dollars but simple packaging when
you open it it looks like kind of like a
lip gloss type you know package but it's
a white cream and I haven't used it yet
it looks like eyelash glue to be honest
doesn't smell like eyelash glue though
so that's good but it does feel kind of
tacky which is perfect because that's
what you want it's for a glitter to
stick to I mean you don't want anything
that's gonna feel like silicone you know
and it does it feels tacky like true
like my my hands I wish you guys could
see it they're like getting stuck to my
hand in a way so that is great I haven't
used it yet but I'll have to let you
guys know I know that Too Faced sells
one but I'm sure it's like $18 I mean
you know so if this works this is great
and it's like two or three dollars and
it's such an easy thing to add to your
makeup collection to use on the few
times a year that you would use it you
know it's not really a waste of money I
also got like five backups I'm not even
kidding you of the elf makeup remover I
use this thing and replace it like once
a month
the one I'm using right now there I mean
it's just a pen and what I do like what
I'm doing I know my makeup doesn't look
great I've been teaching all day but I
just use it to clean up the edges of my
liner so if you're trying to do a crazy
wing or a really simple wing or just
whatever you can use it to clean it up
and it's so perfect and that I always
wipe this off afterwards that way it
stays as clean as possible for as long
as possible you can also take it out and
flip it around however this edge is a
little I mean it's not the really the
right shape so I usually once I've done
that I only keep it for like maybe one
more week because it kind of hurts on
that other side but these are three
dollars and if you get them online for
50% off their you know dollar fifty I
just stock up and buy
because I replaced the once a month and
I love them I mean they are truly an
everyday used product for me okay I also
got some trying to glaze nail polishes
I'm wearing one on my nails right now
it's this pink one called be bright back
and I ordered this these both from Ulta
calm and I ordered some NYX things that
you'll see in a second and it's just
such a pretty pink color and it's just a
little bit different I think it is such
a pretty pretty color I just love it and
with spring and summer eventually coming
I'm doing whatever I can to like back in
the spring to come the other thing
speaking of warmer weather I got is
flip-flop fantasy which gosh for like
two years I have wanted this color and
it's this crazy bright neon peach but
what I like about it is it makes you
look Tanner than you are so it's a great
toenail polish color because it makes
your feet look nicer I think and from
what I've seen of other people's feet
with this on that sounds so gross but
you know what I mean
I got an Instagram and stuff it looks so
beautiful so I'm really excited to
finally have this and these are both
such fun colors I would recommend in the
formula is nice it just it's it's thin
but it goes on smoothly you need two
coats at least to the pink one that I've
tried you need two coats but I do two
coats of pretty much any polish anyways
so I feel like I want more highlight on
I'm gonna put on this TP I'm just using
a diva beauty brush but I mean there's a
decent amount on there oh it's just so
glowy but not like glittery can't even
throw some up there I love it so much
whoo oh my gosh I'm sorry I'm like so
excited because for like years I passed
that up thinking oh it's too dark and
I'm so glad I finally got to swatch it
because now I'm realizing like wow that
is amazing
I'm sorry you guys this video so long I
don't want to rush through it because
there's so much I've to say about all
these things okay the next thing I got
were some Rimmel lip products which I'm
wearing today I finally got the Rimmel
lip liner in East End snob it's their
exaggerated lip liner these are like
four dollars maybe five I don't even
think of that much but what's
interesting to me is the tip it is
completely different than anything I've
ever seen in a lipliner and I'm sure
there are other ones like this out there
but I've never used them so this one is
such a perfect just kind of dusty rose
color which for I mean you guys know the
lip colors that all of us are wearing
right now are that color basically and
it works under any of the versions
whether it's like a more Brown nude or
more of a rosy nude it would work under
any of them also it looks amazing on its
own so this is unbelievable I have a
feeling I will fly through this and buy
another one because I cannot believe how
perfect this is so I put it on and then
I topped it with well I got four of them
these are the Rimmel lasting finish
color rush long-lasting intense color
bombs so it's basically their bomb
sticks but these are the best ones I've
ever tried the Revlon ones I had a ton
out and literally got rid of I think all
but maybe one or two because I liked him
enough but I never reached for him
because I didn't love the way they made
my lips look they was just kind of like
it's okay you know and I was like I can
get that look with anything so I ended
up getting rid of a lot but these are
like a lipstick but they feel like a
bomb but they're not crazy I don't know
how to describe it is that Tyler ah yeah
he was supposed to work late tonight but
he might get off early yes anyway okay
so very excited for these the one I'm
wearing on my lips right now which will
be no surprise to you is the one that's
like the most normal which is called
make me blush and it's just I'll put
more on it's just a pretty pink like
it's so simple mm-hmm I just like it let
me know if you want a like a swatch and
review video of the colors that I have
because I did buy four of them and
that's what I was kind of planning on
doing but I want to make sure there's an
interest in it first this one is in keep
mobbing and it's it looks just like a
lighter version of the Rimmel lip liner
a really pretty
mauve color this one is if you've been
looking for that kind of really in style
color
one is like dead on it's perfect the
other one I got is more of a reddish
tone and it's in on fire and it's you
know just a nice kind of Coralie red
almost but these are so moisturizing but
still pigmented they look like a
lipstick they don't look all sheared out
but they don't move because I felt like
the Revlon lip balm or lip but not lip
butters the Revlon you know what I'm
talking about I felt like those moved
outside my lips a lot and I didn't like
that and the last one I got which I'm
excited to try as well is Viva violet
which is more of a well I thought it
would be more of a berry tone but it's
more of a pink I was thinking this would
be a lot deeper just based on the way it
looks but it's this one here anyway well
it looks pretty regardless I mean I'll
wear it but so I was so impressed with
the formula of these these are awesome
let me know if you want to review so the
next thing I got were a ton of NYX
products now I have loved NYX for a long
time but I don't buy it all the time
because there's not really an Ulta super
close to where I live so I don't just go
buy tons of NYX things and the NYX
things that are at like Target and other
stores near me are kind of ones that
I've already tried and either liked but
I don't need more of or I don't like so
the ones online were the ones that I was
drawn to getting I did buy a backup will
mount a backup I'm almost out of mine of
the NYX control freak
eyebrow gel it's just a clear gel I'll
show you the open one I have hold on I
basically replaced my honest Tashia one
with this one and it's really really
good you guys and it's like under $10
and the anasazi one's like 20-something
I will say however that the Anastasio
one is a little more like hairspray I
don't know how else to say that and of
course you could use actual hairspray
and comb it through but it holds a
little bit better but this one I mean I
don't have unruly eyebrows I mean
they're not perfect but they're not like
crazy so it's not that big of a deal to
me that these don't have as strong of a
hold but if you know that's a big deal
to you you might not love this as much
but if you're kind of chill like I am
you will love this I really like it
enough that I bought another one and
that is very rare for me the other thing
that I got is the NYX
micro brow pencil speaking of anasazi
it's supposed to be a dupe for it now I
have used my Anasazi brow wiz for like a
year and a half I've bought like five of
them I love it
I love it so much so it's gonna be a
very hard sell for me too like this I
would love to like it because it's like
20 dollars cheaper a little less than
that but it's way cheaper it's the same
idea where half of it has like the tiny
spoolie and I've heard that you know the
honest Asya spoolie is like patented and
no one can copy it but you guys this is
pretty freakin darn close I've heard
people say it's totally different not to
me I've used this now all week and I
don't notice the difference between this
difference with this bully so anyone
that's told you different I mean I don't
know this difference I've been using
anasazi one for almost few years and
I've been using this for a week and
they're the same to me now the pencil is
a little different I feel like the next
one's a little bit drier but it's not
bad and I got this one I wear me and
brown which used to be medium ash in the
Anastacio and this one i got in i think
taupe that what I got yeah and it's it's
perfect I'm wearing it today you guys I
like it it's not exactly the same but
it's still really good I feel like I
might want to try one that's that pulls
a little less red what do you guys think
I don't know but I haven't no I mean it
stays on all day I've had this on since
5 in the morning and it's like 6:00 at
night now or something like that
so I think this is pretty freaking
awesome I'm so excited that it's so
cheap uh-huh
but I'm like I said I might try another
color since I couldn't get it in store I
might try another one just to see if
it's a little closer to what I would
want I'm so excited about all the NYX
things I got okay I also finally and I
didn't even know they redid these this
is the NYX high definition blush pretty
sure they have some of the same colors
from their regular blush line so I don't
know maybe that's a different formula I
don't know but this is the high
definition blush in taupe which really
is a bronzer or contour shade I used it
today to contour I think it looks
amazing you guys all day I kept looking
I know this
I kept looking the mirror I was like
okay like I feel like I actually did a
decent job doing my contour today and I
just feel like I did it
even for kind of like bronzing up this
area as well I it looks so nice I used
my thick elf ultimate kabuki brush which
I did that review on because it does
such an even application of everything I
think but this is very cool toned which
is exactly what you want in a contour
although it's kind of looking warmer on
camera it blends so beautifully and I
just love this and it's so cheap and you
guys know that I love my Kevyn Aucoin
one that's like 40 something stupid
dollars but this is a comparison they're
not the same you can tell that I mean
upon first glance they are not the same
but they are both so beautiful on the
skin and really they have the same
effect I'm gonna be honest with you guys
I might like this one better on my skin
tone the next one that is I don't know I
need to try them out more but I know
that I love the Kevin Kwan but this one
might be even better with my skin tone
and it's so much cheaper I could shop to
the heavens and the packaging is really
cute it's just real thin which I like
and it's got a little bow there and it's
great I might get some of their blushes
in this packaging too I don't have any I
used to have a couple NYX blush but I
don't have them anymore I either got rid
of them or I used them up or I gave I
know I gave one to my mom that she loves
okay so I also finally got the NYX HD
concealer I had bought this a long time
ago like a long time ago and I ended up
returning it oh I remember when I well
that was so long ago I needed up
returning because I didn't love it but I
think I just wasn't giving it enough
love because I've now used this a couple
days in a row I used it today and it is
amazing I don't know if they
reformulated or maybe back then I was a
dumb-dumb
I don't know but this I love it it
looked all day it looked flawless like
it never got weird or cakey so excited
to give this more love and see how much
more I begin to love it I also got the
NYX wonder pencil which I'm already not
impressed with I used in my waterline
today the Rimmel one I feel like is
better the rimmel rimmel sells their
nude version and the idea is that you
can put this
in your waterline to kind of lighten up
that area to make you look less tired
except for I don't think it does a great
job of that
so I'm getting it like not in my
waterline I don't know and maybe it's
cuz I'm tired right now
and I didn't really try so I'm obviously
gonna try this like a thousand more
times but it's okay I don't I mean the
good news is it's not like NYX is super
expensive
and neither is Rimmel they're probably
about the same price but I think I like
the remember one more it seems a little
more opaque when you put it on so that's
the one I would recommend but I'll try
this some more and see the last next
thing that I got is their matte
finishing spray and I used it this
morning and it didn't okay it does not
make your face matte if you're starting
with the oily face is not going to
mattify your face but what it does do is
it in my head it works like the
all-nighter spray where the all-nighter
spray doesn't add do eNOS to your face
but it holds your makeup where it is
whereas there are those dewy finishing
sprays or like mac fix+ where to me when
i spray those on my skin they make it do
ear than it already was so if you're
already the right amount of doing us or
oiliness this is great because it'll
just keep it the way it is it won't make
it do your whereas some setting sprays
do they make it wait like the L'Oreal
infallible I really like it but it makes
my skin look more greasy so I'll use it
but I have to powder my t-zone after I
spray it on whereas this I didn't need
to and I really liked this it was so
nice and the sprayer nozzle is just even
and I was really impressed with that and
again it's not expensive at all I also
finally picked up the simple cleansing
micellar water and this I've used to
I've done some lip swatch things and
I've used this to remove the lipstick
and it does a pretty nice job I haven't
noticed that it's like the most amazing
thing in the world but from what I've
heard and again I'm not a skin I'm not a
dermatologist by any means I've heard
that it's better for your skin then
maybe some other eye makeup removers or
just makeup removers in general I should
say but the idea the way that they say
to use it is it's a perfect blend of
multivitamin skin loving ingredients and
jets
cleansers to cleanse the skin while
removing makeup skin is left feeling
clean and hydrated so it says apply it
to a cotton pad wipe it all around the
face no need to rub the skin gently wipe
around closed eyes avoid getting into
your eyes no need to rinse after now I
would definitely rinse after no matter
what knowing me because I know how much
makeup that I wear you know foundation
and stuff and I I have to wash my face I
can't imagine not and I have to tone my
face so I don't know if this is meant to
replace a toner like after you've
already washed your face but it sounds
like it's meant to be like an all-in-one
thing that I think if you didn't wear a
lot of makeup that would work but for me
I love makeup I like to wear it everyday
so I might use this to remove my makeup
but I would still wash my face after
that's just the way I am but it's really
cheap and this is the first American
micellar water that I've been able to
get ahold of
I also from essence I bought these on
old PSICOM again this is the essence gel
eye liner in Midnight in Paris now if
you don't know Tyler and I are hoping
new in a Paris for a honeymoon we still
haven't looked it and so it just made me
think of that but I've also heard really
good things about this and I look I use
gel eyeliner every single day I do that
triple wear I do like eye tight line
with a pencil that I do gel or cream
eyeliner then I do liquid liner on top
most days so excited to try this essence
is so cheap oh my gosh so cheap the next
thing I got is this essence I love
extreme mascara I've never tried this I
don't want to open it yet because I
don't want to get air in it because I'm
trying to I just opened my Too Faced
mascara and so and that's really
expensive so I don't want to like open
another and feel like I have to use both
so I'm gonna wait but I will let you
know once I've opened this and try to I
might do like a full review on this but
again so cheap I've heard amazing things
about this if you like crazy volume in
your lashes now the last thing I'm going
to show you and I saved it for last
because it's not something I bought
Pacific has sent me these it's the
Pacific
coconut water cleansing wipes now I have
used these a few days I haven't used
cleansing wipes in months because I've
been using cleansing oil because then
I'm not having to rub things against my
face with cleansing oil you just get a
little bit and it's such a great formula
that you can just gently rub a lot
gentler than I would be with a wipe and
it
kind of breaks the makeup apart and then
when I rinse my face with actual
cleanser it just comes right off whereas
with this I do this and then I'm still
having to scrub even with the cleanser
to get it off so this is probably gonna
be great for wiping off makeup swatches
but for me on my face it smells great
but I my makeup doesn't come off that
easily I mean it just doesn't and I
don't use waterproof stuff but I do use
gel liner everyday and that alone is
tricky to get off so if you are like me
then you probably like it but if you
don't wear as much as I do then you
might like these because they do smell
really nice and they also sent me this
which I have not tried I'm actually
really excited it's there a light multi
mineral BB cream and let's see the
packaging is freaking gorgeous you're
kidding me cute this is so is there like
a color or anything it says a light but
that's not like it says for all skin
types it says an all-in-one weightless
tint for effortless natural beauty and
adjust to your skin shade it diminishes
pores fine lines and uneven tone fight
signs of aging
gives your skin a dewy radiant bear
finish so it looks dark for my skin that
is I mean it still looks dark but it
seems to be blending out nicely don't
you I mean wouldn't you agree oh it kind
of has a nice smell something about it
reminds me of my childhood I just like
literally I smelled it and I instantly
pictured B in my backyard well that
makes you want to cry oh my gosh what is
wrong - well it's that time of the month
do you guys ever get like that you think
of something from your childhood and you
instantly just tear up like I'm
literally about to cry
just thinking about it that's so amazing
just picturing me in my backyard with my
little brother playing what is wrong
with me I'm so much I'm just like my
mother anyway it smells like
strawberries in a way and something
about that makes me well there was a
strawberry pet it's a long story anyway
it looks nice
and it does look a little bit dewy so
I'm excited to give that a try and see
Pacifica I do I will say they sell
Pacific on Vitacost which I use vitacost
like crazy for tons of things so it's a
really natural brand so there's usually
really good ingredients in them so it
would be awesome if this worked because
on days that I'm using a BB cream which
I really should use them like every day
if they're good for me to take care of
my skin so this would be cool if this
was great so excited to give that a shot
you guys oh my gosh you made it you made
it this is the longest video ever I've
made longer anyway I hope that was
helpful for you guys let me know what
you'd like me to review I also I'm going
to film a Dollar Tree haul again because
I went literally looking for things for
a science experiment for my classroom
and I ended up walking out with none of
those things because they didn't have
them and tons of makeup because they had
all new like name-brand stuff like there
was a ton of NYC L'Oreal Sally Hansen
Physicians Formula I mean I like Revlon
