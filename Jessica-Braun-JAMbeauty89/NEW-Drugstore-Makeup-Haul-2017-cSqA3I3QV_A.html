huge drugstore haul before I get too far
into it I hope that you will subscribe
before you leave to catch more my
drugstore videos as well as high-end
videos let's go and get into it I found
what could be an amazing tooth so I have
owned let me grab it the Sephora Vera
Mona color switch thing for your brushes
well they have this brand swiss firs at
Walmart and it's their instant brush
cleaner and it is the exact same thing
it has a square tin and it has that same
inner part that's just kind of like that
stuff you use this nipple on like a fake
beard if you're in like hipper anyway
it's so cheap you could make your own
but this one I don't remember the price
but it was definitely cheaper than the
be Ramona one and took a little bit
different of a shape but literally other
than that that it is the exact same
thing I found mine on an end cap at
Walmart in the makeup aisle so just keep
your eyes peeled they probably have it
online too and I will try to find links
for everything down below I just thought
that was awesome I also bought the
Garnier skin active moisture balm sheet
mask now as I had found these I snapped
to you guys and said okay I'm at Walmart
what things should I get I was asking
about some cleansing balls and things
but I snapped about these Garnier sheet
masks and I already bought it and when I
looked at a lot of the snaps afterwards
you guys you're like don't buy the pink
one get the blue one or the green one
of course I bought the pink one like
dang it so if you tried to think when
you've had a good experience let me know
because some people said they broke out
some the people are like I don't want to
try and then break out so I'm kinda like
I also picked up another butter blush
from Physicians Formula they came out
with two new shades I already own the
original two shades and I actually
really like them a lot of people felt
that they weren't as pigmented as they
hoped I don't mind when a blush isn't
crazy pigmented because then it means
there's a lot more room for error and so
if I put too much on it never looks too
crazy so this one's in the shade rosy
pink and it's just a really pretty
classic blue toned pink I do think this
one is a little bit more pigmented than
the other two but I'm kind of more
on to like the other colors than this
one so kind of a tit-for-tat there I
don't know but I do like it and I do
recommend any of them
I love them they smell like I also
picked up the ponds cold cream cleanser
I really like cleansing bombs that are
more like bomb like they really are
moisturizing while they remove all of
your makeup and then I would go in with
a regular cleanser well I asked you guys
for drugstore suggestions apparently
equate has a cleansing balm that's just
like the Clinique take the day off but I
didn't find it in the store I know you
can buy it online but a lot of you guys
also recommended the ponds cold cream
cleansers so I picked it out I used to
use this when I was younger it has the
exact smell they have not changed a
thing my mom I think still uses this so
it makes me think of my mom so I'm
excited to give this a try again now
that I'm Way more into make up a little
bit more knowledgeable and see if I
still like it it I will say of course
it's a totally different consistency
just a totally different product than
other cleansing bones this really is
more like almost lotion like it's
totally different but I'm excited to try
it again
I bought one two three beauty sponges I
bought the Eco tools ones that everyone
is talking about it comes within a
little two pack with a smaller one and a
bigger one but everyone seems to love
them I can't wait to try them because
I'm definitely on a Beautyblender kick
when it comes to how I'm applying my
foundation I also picked up the L'Oreal
blend artist infallible let me open this
one I'm so curious so I want to feel
this one because I'm just curious I
heard I think people were liking this it
feels like the Beauty Blender how they
finally figured it out it's so not dense
it feels just like the Beauty Blender
let me feel these Ecotools ones as well
ooh there's a coupon sweet these feel a
lot denser like this boreal one
literally this is like this one is a lot
denser kind of like the pure sponges
that I don't like but I'll have to
actually test it out let you know
because there's gotta be a reason people
are really liking these I think it's
cold it comes to two but I'm really
excited about this L'Oreal holy moly
the other sponges I got are from Real
Techniques and they're the tiny baby
ones and
and I don't own any of the Beautyblender
small ones so and I really never wanted
to but lately I've been watching some
people know use them for like their
under-eye and I do use my Beauty Blender
for my under-eye and it is just a little
bit too big so I thought this is perfect
I can save some money but try some out
that are that size and see if I even
like it and I do like the Real
Techniques orange ones so I've got all
kinds of sponges to try such a key
colors alright I bought two foundations
both of which I have owned in the past
one of them is this Rimmel lasting
finished foundation I bought it in ivory
which is 100 I love this foundation and
I think I declared it long ago probably
listening in that long ago just because
I had too many foundations I wasn't
using it but lately I felt like I've
been really falling in love with a lot
of drugstore foundations and I
remembered loving this one
it just had I would say medium to full
coverage it was a beautiful satin finish
wasn't too dewy wasn't too mattifying
and I just really liked it and I think
100 is going to be a good shade match
for me so very excited to own that again
the other one I picked up is the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi I swear to you guys this
is the third time I've bought this now I
have use this this week I used it after
I bought it and I'm so drawn this might
be my favorite foundation packaging of
anything high-end drugstore I think it
is the prettiest packaging and I think
that's why I keep buying it thinking oh
maybe I'll like it now well this is the
third time I bought this and it just
does not provide enough coverage my nose
is red no matter how I use this I feel
like it doesn't cover that redness so
unless I put on like literally concealer
all over my nose and then put this on
maybe it would work I'm gonna keep
trying it as I always do but I'm just
sad because I think I don't know maybe
it literally is just the packaging I
want to like this why don't I like you I
love to pump as well I got it in the
shade in 1/2 which is neutral I've tried
the warmer one and I just feel like this
one's a little bit better for me next up
is a new product for Milani I didn't
know they came out with it's their make
it dewy setting spray I'm curious if
this is similar to the Tasha one that
one I didn't love because it was so
doing but if you really like that you
you would like it because that's exactly
what it does but this one I'm just
curious I haven't tried it yet but I
think the packaging is gorgeous
I love their make it last setting spray
so I thought that is awesome that they
have a dewy one I like I actually like
this packaging better than to make it
last one cause it's good to make it last
one just looks dirty already although I
am halfway done with it but so excited
this fragrant oil is fantastic on these
I was going to say for drugstore know if
they're just fantastic overall so very
excited if you don't like the other one
or you'd rather have a dewy one I think
you would like this I mean I don't know
when something is right out but I really
could next I picked up two Milani
highlighters I have been looking for
these everywhere and I finally found
them at Walmart they are there strobe
light instant glow powders I bought
afterglow and I bought state glow
afterglow is a little bit more ivory and
then the one that's a little more yellow
tone is called day glow these are pretty
good I don't think they're like
earth-shattering highlights but are they
really pretty yes they really are they
are definitely less glittery they're
more like hourglass type powers where
they're just a little bit more
understated and more lit from within
which is my favorite kind of highlight
for most days so I love that about it I
think these are decently pigmented they
stay on pretty well throughout the day
and they just look really nice in your
skin so if you're looking for that kind
of a highlight but you don't want to
fork out like 30 or 40 dollars for
high-end one these are really nice I
really do like this now speaking of that
lit from within glow I found this
product no one has talked about it's
their Milani prep set glow illuminating
transparent powder this is just like the
hourglass dim light powder
let me grab it so looking at the
swatches the hourglass one is a little
bit deeper and the Milani one is lighter
but they both have that similar effect
where it's just kind of again a little
bit glowy but not enough that it looks
like you're trying it looks like you're
just that's the way your skin is and
that's what I think it's so amazing
about those powders the next thing I
picked up is from Physicians Formula and
it is their bronze booster highlight and
contour palette so it has three
different shades and I bought it in the
shade map sculpting I think
had one that was more glowy and I just
wanted to try this one I heard a couple
people have tried it it's really thick
packaging but it's like a nice plastic
which I don't mind it opens to here and
then once you open it farther it pops up
in the bottom compartment and adds like
a brush not the best brush in the world
but it's better than not having a brush
at all and it's you know it's actually
decently soft but I like that it's not
one of their little tiny ones I like
that it's got a little handle on all
sides a mirror there so let's watch this
I haven't even swatch this it looks like
there's more of a WoW ronzi shade a more
gray contour shade and then of course a
matte highlighting shade they kick up a
little bit of powder but not so much
that you're like oh like it really was
not too bad but it does kick up some
powder but it's got a nice pigment to it
I could see myself using this like
highlighting shade to set my under eye
powder to do just a straight-up matte
highlight maybe on my nose or maybe even
on the top of my cheekbones but again
there's no shimmer in this one but I do
think the other one is all shimmer but I
thought this was just awesome
what a great concept I like the
packaging actually a lot and I could see
if I end up liking this I could see
myself traveling with this because I
liked it as a bronzer contour and
highlight there and at least for my skin
tone I actually think these will be
pretty good think if you're much deeper
I don't know that they would work as
well of course so alright so I also
bought another one of the Milani
everyday eyes palette this one's an
earthy element I was just drawn to the
orange in here and like this kind of
almost Moroni brown color I just think
these palettes are so good from the
drugstore there are really great
collections of colors they have enough
option I think anyone can find something
they like there are some house I just
don't like like there's one that's like
a really smoky one in like I would not
use that enough to ever buy that I would
use maybe the black shade in it but
that's about it but this one I felt like
I would use every shade they have a nice
medium warm Brown a beautiful matte
orange it got a nice satin kind of
shimmery Brown they again they kick up a
little bit of powder but not enough that
it totally ruins your look so you might
have a little bit of fallout in my
experience but I've been able to just
grab
like a powder brush slick it off and
it's totally gone it doesn't set into
your skin or anything like that so I
just the only shade in here I realized I
didn't really like is the very first one
that's like shimmery one because I ended
up having kind of like a glittery type
fallout but it was not a lot of glare I
don't know it just it didn't cover kind
of blended away once I put it on my lid
and I didn't like that whereas the other
one really blended well with each other
but that was the only one that kind of
was a dud for me I also picked up one
more one more
a version what am I saying I picked up
the Rimmel stay matte powder I used to
love this stuff I haven't had it my
collection for a while I actually buy it
in a darker shade it's in 0:04 sandstorm
this is always the shade I've bought and
it's like the fourth or fifth shade in
and they don't have a lot but for some
reason I've just always gotten the shade
and it always works so and I have the
transparent but I'd rather have one with
a little bit of color because I don't
need to make myself any paler I don't
think but it's just a great powder
coconut oil as we're heading into summer
I thought that's perfect it's
lightweight but it does soak up the oil
I also bought I've actually already
pulled out of packaging the Maybelline
master precise skinny I bought this in
preparation for my future dupe video to
compare to my hourglass 1.5 millimeter
pencil I love that stuff is crazy creamy
crazy small and detailed this one is
1.95 so it's not quite as small but it's
still really skinny and I like that it
is retractable it's pretty creamy just
like the hourglass one so it's still a
contender to possibly be a dupe but if
you're wanting one right now it's really
nice I've been using it a lot of been
using it my waterline as well as the
tight line and I was really pleasantly
surprised so I think the pink packaging
is just fun kind of threw me off
somebody's got a pink liner what is that
no it's just a black liner but it ships
in pretty pink packaging I also finally
pick up the Mota prismatic brushes and
these are these it's there for peace
base perfecting kit a lot of people have
been using these and saying yes they're
really good well I found that Amazon
juice that I love that by $12 and I did
a video comparing that to the really
expensive our peace brush that I have so
I can link that below if you're curious
about those I love both brushes I
kind of like the Amazon one a little bit
more honestly but I've been wanting to
try some smaller ones for like my
concealers so I was really excited to
see this in the store because I want to
try those smaller ones as well so I'll
have to let you know but I was really
excited to see these because it's kind
of one of those things I've seen a
million times online that I've never
actually seen in store to be able to buy
so I was excited to see it I was like I
am buying it so I actually bought a
bunch more stuff at Walmart but I'm in
Seoul a separate hall today of those
because this video is already way too
long but the other ones that will be in
the other Hall are wal-mart specific
brands so flower beauty products hard
candy products and then I also have some
elf products that I think I'm going to
throw into that video as well just
because I love elf and I do get sent a
lot of stuff from house but I also buy
stuff from elf because I just like their
products most of them not all of them so
if you're interested in that if it is up
I will link it below if it is not
subscribed stay tuned it will be up very
shortly I hope you'll stick around and
watch some more of my videos and I can
link my haul playlist of years and years
of hauls down below if you're interested
I just recently did a Sephora haul from
the vib sale some new things that I
picked up so other than that I will see
