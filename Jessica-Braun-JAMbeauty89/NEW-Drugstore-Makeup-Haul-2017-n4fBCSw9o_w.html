excited today is an old-school drugstore
haul I feel like I haven't done a
genuinely awesome drugstore haul and
forever I can't even remember the last
time I feel like I'm just kind of
sporadic but this there's so much new
out I'm sure you know if you watch
youtube videos like I do I mean
everyone's posting hauls because it's
tis the season of new drugstore makeup
spring is around the corner
that's how I'm viewing it because it
feels like a million miles away but
spring is around the corner
I am hopped up on caffeine which is
awesome and let's going into just got to
do Danny's copy right with me but hey if
you haven't seen her if you don't know
about coffee break with Danny where are
you because she's lovely but she always
does Anissa cute I don't know if she
doesn't anymore though she likes to many
people complain like no forget those
complainers is the pew first thing let's
just throw this paint here I've got
three things and I know a lot of you
guys asked me about you know cheaper
skincare this is my favorite cleanser of
all time I repurchase this like four
five six seven eight nine ten I don't
know a million times it's the serum a
hydrating cleanser I love this stuff
when you have dry skin you know your
cleanser can strip your skin of the
things it needs it really can and so
this is one of those things that's so
gentle it feels like you're putting
lotion all over your face and then
wiping it off its and washing off it's
amazing if you've never tried it I've
never had a cleanser with this
consistency and texture it feels amazing
it feels my dry skin so quickly you know
especially paired with a good
moisturizer so I love it if you haven't
tried it and you've been looking for
something hydrating but it still cleans
your skin really well this is the answer
I'm telling you and you know what this
lasts a while the next thing I got is
the Garnier skin active my stellar
makeup removing palette I keep hearing
that the regular the Guardian micellar
water is being you know a lot of people
aren't buying it anymore it's being
pulled off of some shelves cuz there
might be ingredients there
cancer-causing I don't know I haven't
really done the research yet I've heard
a lot of you guys you know kind of send
me some articles and stuff but this is
my fellow water in a towel I don't know
what the ingredient is that they're
talking about and if it's in here so I
only used it once I might just switch it
I don't use makeup remover
on my face anyway but I was going to use
this just for swatches so I might still
do it for that and then I'm done with
them I don't know what the package
because no people like pink so if you
know if you hook it up and you know this
is free and clear let me know below the
reality is it's also up in the air
because I don't think anything's been
conclusive yet last skincare item is the
st. eyes black head clear and green tea
scrub I snap to you guys a long time ago
about if I should buy it or not so many
you guys like yet some of you guys said
no some of you guys didn't like that it
has the little exfoliating beads like
really tiny ones and that it could cause
like micro tears in your skin I only use
this once I liked it I don't typically
foliate with a physical exfoliator like
this more often than like once a week so
I don't worry too much about it because
I don't do it very often I don't think
you'd want to see this every day that's
just my opinion but it says it clears
blackheads and calms remnants those are
two the biggest problems I have I've got
redness on my cheeks all the time and I
certainly have blackheads on my nose so
excited to try it I liked that it had
green tea involved it is a green scrub
and it does have style silic acid and
it's got 1% so I'll have to get back to
you guys on that I also bought a nail
polish I feel like I never buy nail
polish my nails are on a break right now
it's the OPI one in kiss me on my tulips
and it's just a really pretty pink again
I'm thinking towards spring and I just
wanted something bright and fun i
declutter my nail polishes just on my
own all the time I don't know like film
it so I only have like 10 or 11 nail
polishes I really kind of keep it pared
down because again it's not my forte I
like painting my nails I like having
them painted but I like to give them a
break a lot and plus I'm a teacher I
just I feel like I don't have time to
constantly do the upkeep but love this
color and the OPI formulas good I don't
think you have to spend eight dollars to
get a nail polish that will work I think
this all of the Sally Hansen ones are
just as good even they're like two
dollar one just make sure you have a
really good like base coat and top coat
I really like that these are more pricey
but then you can save money by cheaper
polishes but the Sephora
formula x space and
the primer coat and the top coat are
amazing they work so well with any nail
polish when I still need kinds of videos
I feel like it's like when I first
started my channel and like this was
what my whole channel was based around
the strokes for stuff drugstore hauls he
ended up store reviews and I still do
that I like to try and keep it at least
like 5050 with some high-end stuff
question but it's just so exciting okay
so I am wearing on my brows this product
and I will show you a demo of the
applying it as I talked here this is the
Revlon Colorstay brow pencil and I have
it in dark brown on one side it's got
this pencil it's a retractable one and
then on the other side it's got a nice
fully and I love the shape and size of
this bully it's so perfect I think it's
really sleek packaging I love the gold
that they have on the kind of ferrule
for the spoolie and the shape of the
brow pencils a little bit thicker than
my liking but it still works
now here's my only gripe about this I do
feel like it's really pigmented which is
not a bad thing but you do have to be
careful because you can tend to put too
much on
and then what's nice though is that the
spoolie as you're brushing through it
you'll you can see how it just kind of
will really kind of even it all out so
you don't see the brush strokes as much
and kind of get rid of some of that
pigmentation that might have been too
much so do I think it's the best present
I've ever used no do I think it's a
really good one from the drugstore yes
and you know there have been so many
brow products in the drugstore I have
absolutely hated I feel like I'm really
picking with my eyebrows and this is one
that I was like wow like if this were
the only one I had I could totally use
this everyday like I like it alright so
a lip product
I'm loving this is a Vaseline lip
therapy from rosy lips that's not ones
from it's in the rosy lips shade
literally it's pink but it has a slight
rosy scent but it's not too rosy I think
it's a good mix like I've never said
Smith's won the Rose Bowl I really like
but it's got a needed stronger rosy
scent and it's a little bit too much for
me sometimes but I really like this I
feel like it's a kind of a similar
product and that it comes open easily I
was laughing because when I had put this
on Instagram or something that I was
buying this one of you guys commented
something maybe
out loud you said something like
Vaseline in a slippery Vaseline fingers
with a jar like that and no thing
because these can be so hard to open a
special if your hands are like slippery
from Vaseline or something
I just thought that was so funny but I
will say the lid actually opened much
more easily than other ones I've had in
the past if that makes any sense but I
just really liked it just a couple bucks
I like to have it just thrown in my
purse
alright moving along so Revlon has three
new blushes that they're selling and
when I saw Mobil she won't show choice
because I haven't tried I feel like real
on just I don't know like I used to love
them so much but lately I feel like
they're just not quite on the same car
of like new and inventive ideas they're
always so slow behind the times in my
opinion not that I don't like Revlon
because obviously I do and that's why I
got so excited when they had this new
stuff but I just feel like you know
Maybelline is constantly like all over
trends I feel like covergirl even is too
and Revlon just a little bit behind the
time now I feel like Revlon is a you
know they're in my opinion they're like
a classy older woman because they're
just they look back and see how other
things do and then they decide okay
we'll do that too it's a trend that
stuck or oh that was a trend that flew
by glad we didn't waste the time so it's
not necessarily a bad thing but I was
excited when there are new things out so
the blush form it it's just their Revlon
it just says Revlon powder blush and I
have three shades this one's in rosy
rendezvous I've worn this one a lot this
week it's it's a total Jessica color
just really simple light pink and of
course these come with the brushes this
one's an orchid charm this is what I'm
wearing today and I think it looks nice
it was a little easy to get heavy-handed
with these so touchy with this color
because it is a little bit brighter than
I would typically wear so I do you do
have to use a lighter hand if you've got
a skin tone like mine for this shade and
then this one I actually haven't even
opened yet so I'm realizing just now
maybe they already have these powder
blushes but these are new shades because
they also initiate
my mistake this one's in bronze beauty
so I figured oh my gosh it could be a
blush but it could also be a bronzer if
you again like a skin tone like mine
these kick up some powder and they're
not like BAM in your face kind of
blushes but they're so nice and if
you're a beginner or if you just don't
want to have to worry so much about
perfect placement every day when you're
getting ready like me then I don't mind
when products aren't like BAM and your
face Figment it especially with bronzers
and blush because I don't always want it
to be BAM in your face you know what I'm
saying so I think these are nice not the
best blush as I've tried in the world
but honestly I feel like the drugstore
doesn't have as many options for blush
and these are really nice and I think my
favorite shade is rosy rendezvous
repurchase this is the L'Oreal lacquer
liner in blackest black I've been trying
to I just mentioned it today the cielo
smudge pot hated it hated it hated it it
was so expensive hated it so I went back
to my old trusty L'Oreal one it's what
I'm wearing today it's a gel liner so
black it glides on oh my gosh it's just
I think it is my favorite gel liner I've
ever tried period straight up favorite
it's just so good at what it does it
does not move all day it's easy to apply
I mean it's got everything you want if
you like gel or cream eyeliner so it
comes with a brush that's actually
pretty good as well I also bought the
new 24 karat news from Maybelline um
guys palette
bucks I can't even sugarcoat it in stock
so first of all in the store and this is
just the store I don't think all of them
are like this across you know everywhere
it's sold but I could not find one they
were like 15 there and all of them have
like digs and they weren't even opened
but they have like little crumbles and
like digs out of different colors like
what all of them are like that but okay
let me just give you an example this
green I would expect to be like amazing
that's after doing that for like 30
seconds so that's the swatch like what
it is so hair mist it's not worth it I
don't care if you're looking
and you're like oh but those colors are
so prettyy that's all I'll do and now I
feel like a dummy because I wasted like
hello $10 however much it was on the
stupid palette that it sucks it totally
sucked maybe I should do a video just
about this should I maybe I should um
just because I want to warn you do not
buy it so let's hop back to Revlon and
then we've got a bunch more Maybelline
stuff
so revelon came out their new colors day
cream shadows I put on my snapchat
swatches disease um here's what kills me
they would seemingly be good in the
colours are beautiful I've got a pink
one call in 7:45 I have 7:35 which is
like a green one I have a pretty base
camp a nin 705 and then I have my
favourite just kind of like silvery
purpley color in 7:40 the packaging is
pretty cool because you open it and it's
like a normal just like the color
tattoos are but in a lid you pull out
and there's this little silicon brush so
if you apply it just with your finger
it's like oh wow that looks actually
pretty nice and then you swipe it on
you're like mmm like it's not horrible
but it's not great but when you get the
brush involved and you like oh my gosh
it's like night and day
look at the difference between the two
the one with the brush is so much more
rich in pigment versus that now of
course that makes sense because our
fingers tend to kind of share things out
and kind of it mixes with it the heat of
our fingers mixes with it things like
that but now the only thing is I feel
like this brush is going to get gross
really quickly as I'm just sliding it in
and out of there you know what I mean
you saw a shade in this range that you
were like oh my gosh they don't have
that the color tattoo and I love it
if I would say buy it but do you need
four of them no next thing I picked up
from Maybelline are their master camo
little 6 pan things it's their color
correcting kit so I got the one in light
and you can see it's got you know all
kinds of different shades it even has a
green and then this one is actually
highlight right here and then I also got
the one in medium just because I wanted
to see it I almost did and I thought no
because I want to be able to show that
to you guys so looking at them side by
side if you're kind of deciding which to
get there's no green in the medium one
and there's so a highlight but the
highlight is a little bit deeper than
this one so I mean but honestly it looks
like some of the shades are almost
identical like the yellows are really
close in some of the top shade I mean
they're a little bit lighter in the
light but some of them are kind of
identical so one size so like in this
one the green and the yellow it says
it's for correcting and they're pretty I
have to admit they're pretty creamy so
there's kind of the swatches of them
there and that awkward spot over there
the next one say conceal so there's like
a lighter and a little bit deeper of one
these really are creamy you're off
you'll see those as well because they're
starting to blend into my skin which I
guess is a good thing and then these
both okay so the last row or column here
both say highlight oh yeah
label for Arcona but one is definitely
more shimmery and the other so Jessica
why are you swatching over here there
they are this is the shimmery one on the
bottom it is nice and shimmery the only
thing is it's going to be difficult for
me to like if I want to kind of
highlight I use a bigger brush for a
cream highlight it's going to be hard
for me to get only that so I mean again
that's the kind of silly problem but it
is one that I think about it comes with
this brush that kind of feels okay and
maybe one sided it's a little fluffier
maybe I could use that for highlight
let's try some I mean it it's added some
I like
you could get the tip of your nose I
don't know um I feel like it's kind of
one of those things that the idea that
is great and if you genuinely have a
need for this kind of stuff then buy it
because it feels really creamy I don't
know about the same power but this is
one of those things that you know if you
don't see yourself ever using it then
you don't need it if you genuinely use
things like this all the time then
you'll probably really like it and I
like that there's that range of
different options and I think it's kind
of cool but it has the cream highlighter
in it and of course you could use eye
cream highlight just for your inner
corner if you wanted all kinds of things
like that
so I think there's a time and a place
for this if you need it but if you know
you're never going to be reaching for
products like this then you don't need
it doesn't exist trying to help you guys
not put your money on everything like I
told you guys these anti haul videos are
so fun to watch if you've never watched
one search it and watch because a lot of
people are doing them now and it's just
all about the stuff you shouldn't mind
you don't have to go out buying the next
new thing so I'm trying to kind of weave
that into my regular videos so you know
so you don't feel like oh just because
it's amazing I need to buy it if you're
not ever going to use it don't go buy it
alright so the next thing I bought is
this Revlon kiss balm and it's in like a
coconut scent got SPF 20 tropical
coconut it's just this clear
balm I put it on the other day when I
was getting ready it smells like a dream
it smells like oh my gosh it smells like
that classic coconut smell that you love
that's what it smells like not totally a
real coconut smell but fake in a great
way does that make sense it's
moisturizing the thing is anything
that's SPF for me over time drives a
list out but I thought this is such a
great thing to throw in like my beach
bag or maybe even in your purse if you
know you're outside all the time you can
protect your lips just toss it on you
don't need a mirror smell so nice to
make sure lips look kind of just a
little bit glossy and Volney
but nothing too crazy it's just
comfortable so I thought that's so cool
good for you Revlon because I feel like
you know other than they're like the
Colorstay bombs that are whatever they
were called that they have
you know just like a lip-balm Oh
a bum oh okay so Maybelline sent me
these last things everything else I have
purchased I'm trying to do everything
else I purchased these last few things
they sent to me so I like to put those
at the end but I wanted to show them to
you it's so funny because when I went
shopping for this stuff for most of it
it was kind of collective but when I was
shopping for most of this stuff the next
day in the mail I got sent these to
these next items and I'm glad I didn't
invite us at the store because I saw the
dream cushions but I thought wrong
I'll wait maybe buy it later but it was
kind of kismet that I didn't because
they sentence me that's pretty cool so
these are their dream illuminator
correctors sorry dream brightening
creamy concealer
they sent me 20 light and 30 light
medium I wore 20 light which I think
could be lighter so almost too dark for
me kind of I just put it on my under eye
and guys it worked pretty well I wore it
all day at work now again is it the
creamiest thing you can ever have no but
the convenience of having it in a stick
is really nice and if you would prefer
to have a concealer stick versus like a
liquid one that you gotta squeeze down
or squared out or use a doe foot then
this is one of the creamiest ones I've
tried because usually during that like
lipstick formula usually during like a
lipstick kind of a container if you guys
seen those and I think all the brands
sell their version of it and they're
just a little bit too dry and not quite
what you want but these are actually
pretty creamy again they're not my
favorite concealer in the world if you
already have a concealer you love you
don't need it but if you like creamy
stick concealers but I actually think
you would like it last thing I think is
the Maybelline Dream cushion so again
they sent me 20 and 30 I haven't even
opened it yet so this is a true first
impression it's got the standard cube
packaging just like all the other ones
have where it's got the you know little
thing thing you open it up and then you
gotta actually take this off so it's
kind of sponge that is filled to the
brim with product so you take your
little thing and you literally push it
into that it's covered and saturated
with product and then you just what
press it into your skin any idea is that
you're not put to rub it with this kind
of a formula and product it really is
best applied with the sponge it comes
with that it's so true I've tried like
four different Asian brands I've tried
pretty much every American version and
it's true for all of them you really
need to use one of these types of
sponges and just press it instead of
rubbing it it does not work it doesn't
work with a brush I mean it is the
weirdest thing but it really you have to
do it this way
it looks really dewy doesn't it can you
see how like shiny my hand look again I
think this might be a little too dark
for me I mean I could probably make it
work but just like looking at it of
course it's in the lighting that I'm in
and you're not necessarily seeing what
I'm seeing but again I might try 10 for
myself but it says our first fresh face
liquid foundation in a cushion just
press into the sponge count on to face
blend using small tests yes that's also
so it does is it just this fresh face so
it doesn't say whether it's supposed to
be like Matt or Dewey or whatever but I
think fresh face is a good it just looks
very fresh it's got a hint of doing this
but not like a true dewy foundation
would and I could have noticed that to
be true for most of these cushion tight
foundations they all kind of have that
same finish which is the finish I happen
to like so these might be worth looking
into honestly it's very reminiscent of
the L'Oreal one so I need to give these
more of a try to tell you like which
drugstore one I would truly recommend if
you'd be interested in like a
head-to-head battle like type of video
let me know if you're interested in more
of my drugstore videos or haul I will
link up some of my playlist below but
also subscribe because I'm always
uploading things about drugstore
products and high-end products and
things like that so I hope that you will
I hope you catch me on my social media
right there on the screen and I will see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
