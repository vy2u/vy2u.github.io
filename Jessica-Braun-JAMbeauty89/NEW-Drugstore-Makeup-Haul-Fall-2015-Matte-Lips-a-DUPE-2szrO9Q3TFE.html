going to share with you guys a huge
drugstore makeup haul I am so excited to
share these items with you if you've
been watching my channel you know that
I've decluttered like 70% of my
collection if you haven't seen that
video I'll link it below but that
doesn't mean that I'm not going to still
buy makeup because of course this is my
job to review products and share with
you guys products that do and don't work
for me and why so of course I'm still
going to be trying things out getting
new products but what I'm trying to be
better about is getting rid of products
when I realize that they're not a good
color for me they're not a good fit for
my skin tone skin type you know whatever
the reason is I just want to be better
about making my collection more dynamic
that I'm willing to get rid of things
earlier than I typically do so I am so
excited to share these items with you so
let's go ahead and get into it I think
that I am wearing about half of the
items I'm going to show you today on my
face so that way you can kind of see
what they look like in action so let's
go ahead and start with one of my
favorite foundations this is the Revlon
Colorstay makeup now they have two types
of this and I don't mean like the
whipped kind which I also like but just
of the color state liquid foundation
they've got for normal to dry and then
they have combo and oily I used to use
the combo an oily one however I realize
because it's for oily skin it really
dried my skin out and I was like well I
don't really have Whaley skin so a few
years ago I tried the normal to dry and
I realized that this is the one that I
love because because it's for dry skin
it kind of has more of a satin finish
instead of like a really matte dry
finish and it ends up working really
well with my skins when I'm wearing it
today and I finally got a darker shade
because I've been wearing 150 buff for a
long time and I've loved it because it's
a very neutral color almost grey tone
it's very odd it's not yellow it's not
pink is right in between and that's why
I loved it however it was a little light
for me at least right now so I ended up
getting 200 nude and they got a shade or
two in between 150 and 200
however that shade was really really
pink and I have a yellow undertone so it
wouldn't have worked and it actually at
least the one in the store I was in was
darker than 2-hundred noon so keeping
that in mind I decided to get this one
and it I really like the way it looks
with my skins and I think it works
really really well I am so excited to
have this in my collection again I also
purchased a blush that I had in the past
declutter and I decluttered it because
it had the one I had had glitter in it
and I hated it this is the Milani baked
blush and it's in the shade Luminoso
tons of people here on YouTube rave
about this and I never understood why
because the one I had had yellow chunks
of glitter and it just looked horrible
on my skin but when I've seen recent
swatches of this it looks different than
what I remembered and I'm like what in
the world like maybe that's why people
liked it maybe I had a bad one or maybe
they reformulated it so I was like you
know what it was on sale I bought it at
the store near me called Meyer it was on
sale recently so I was like I'm just
gonna try it again it is the most
beautiful peachy shade it has shimmer
for sure but those glitters that I
remember being in it originally are no
longer there so I am so ecstatic it is
gorgeous I'm wearing it today I think it
looks really nice if you have a fair
skin tone but it also looks nice and
almost frosty if you have a deeper skin
tone so I love this and these blushes
really are amazing they do have some
that still have the glitter that I'm
just like no I know I won't like it so I
just don't mess with it but this one is
gorgeous I also picked up this nail
polish I don't have a black nail polish
I realized and my nail polish collection
I actually have it in one of these yours
here and there I don't have much I've
gotten rid of a lot and I've just been
really good about having one of each
color that I would actually wear and
nothing else so I I'm pretty drown
myself for how I've kept that
decluttered but I don't have a black one
and this Zoya one was there and I know
I've tried ones away a Polish and I
loved the formula so it's in the shade
Raven and it just made me excited for
Halloween it's just a black but it does
have
kind of a shimmer to it so I'm excited
to wear this I think it'll be perfect
and I'm excited to try out the formula
in another shade and see if I still like
it another thing I bought is this Real
Techniques brush I have most of them I
haven't tried any of the bold metals
collection because they're really
expensive but all the other ones I've
tried but this one I had and this is
their sculpting brush and it's got this
kind of it's thinner than you would
think which I really like so it's thin
enough that you can actually like kind
of sculpt out your cheek bone I love
this brush you can really get exactly
where you want to be especially if
you're just gonna be doing your
cheekbones it's amazing and these are
typically right around 10 knowledge I
think this one was right around 10
dollars another product that I had
finally it's always been in my
collection but the one I had was expired
is the wet and wild color icon bronzer
and reserve your Cabana this was
mentioned in my top 5 highlighters video
where I just mentioned my 5 favorite
drugstore highlighters and why and so
the one I show on there is my old one I
finally got rid of it because it does
have SPF and so there's an expiration
date on it I love this stuff it is just
this gorgeous really really almost
creamy powder and it's got this yellow
tone and what was the kind of yellow but
it just is this gorgeous highlight
that's just glowy it's not really
shimmery at all you almost I mean you
can't really detect any shimmer but it
has just this boost of radiance that
when you put it on and I'm wearing it
today it's the only highlight I have on
it just completely lightens the area but
it also adds that glow that you know I
feel like when people wear this people
look at them and they think like do they
just have dewy skin or I mean how are
they doing that and it's this because
you know when it's a highlight highlight
you can tell like oh they're wearing
highlighter and that's why but with this
it's almost undetectable now of course
I'm wearing this with the Milani blush
that also has shimmer to it too so that
adds to it but this stuff is amazing
it's under five dollars I think it's 399
and I will always have this in my
collection I love it so much another
product I got but it's almost a regret
already is this maybelline color tattoo
now I love the color tattoos I got the
shade creamy beige and I guess this is
from their leather collection I'm just
now seeing I bought this creamy beige
just looking at it in here well now it
looks dark on the camera it looked to me
and person almost like painterly the
Paint Pot for Mac it's like a just kind
of a nude color beige that I can put all
over my lid is almost like a primer but
it covers up any discoloration I was
hoping to find a drugstore version no
this is so much more Brown and darker
than I thought it's still a beautiful
color but the way I use cream shadow I
probably won't use this shape I will try
we'll see but the formula is always
great and this one is no different there
they're pretty blendable for what it is
things that have left are all lip
products and I am so excited about every
single thing that I bought and I've
tried all of them out now so let's go
the first one is the one that I'm
wearing on my lips this one is okay I
bought three of these these are the
Revlon Super Lustrous lipsticks now this
line of lipsticks has been out for
decades and they have so many shades and
for months it's just like Mac where
they've got the they've got cream ones
matte ones pearl ones I feel like
there's one more kind but I actually
have in my lip pure here or other shades
that I have that I love I already own
pink in the afternoon cherries in the
snow Primrose and peach me they're all
gorgeous shades and I might do a video
now that I have more I might just do
like a lip swatch review video because
these lipsticks are amazing and there's
so many shades so I bought very hot
which is or very Haute however you say
it which is the color I'm wearing on my
lips right now it's just this gorgeous
actually wearable purple like it is
purple so like don't fool yourself
because like when I put this on today
this is actually the first time I was
wearing it I was like okay this is
actually a purple lipstick but it's
actually kind of wearable so if you're
not scared of that then I would say it's
got a pink shift to it where it doesn't
look like bright purple but again it is
purple so keep that in mind but I think
it is absolutely beautiful and wearable
especially in the fall I know we always
talk about like berry tones in the fall
but I love that it's one of my favorite
things about fall is wearing those on my
so love the shade these are so creamy
clearly really pigmented um the other
one I got was actually the last two I
got are both from their matte line and
you kind of have to search they don't
have them separated by finish so it's
not like they have all the maps you have
to just look in all the different levels
of lipsticks and see where the matte
ones are this one's a matte one in pink
pout and it's just this kind of light
warm toned pink right there and their
matte ones are so gorgeous they remind
me of the Maybelline matte ones they
absolutely hold their own and I think
they have this these matte ones for a
while now and no one talks about them
that much because it wasn't like a matte
line or matte collection like everyone's
coming out with now they've just had
them for a while so it's absolutely
beautiful again crazy creamy crazy
pigmented they're so comfortable on the
lips and then the last Revlon one I got
is from their matte collection it's in
stormy paint now this one I'll swatch it
kind of next to that one this one is a
lot brighter of a pink so you can see
it's just on camera it's not looking
this one it has a way more of a blue or
a cool tone to it whereas this one's
warm and this one is brighter on camera
like I said it's not as stark of a
difference but in person this one
definitely is bright so I would say if
you know you don't like bright pink but
you do want a wearable pink go with pink
pout instead of stormy pink but they're
both beautiful I love all of these so
another one that I found that I was like
how is like I was losing my mind finding
this this is the NYC expert last
lipstick these are so cheap they're like
two or three dollars and I had had a
bright pink one before that I got like
in an Influenster box and I remember it
was two bright pink and I was like I'm
never gonna wear this so I got rid of it
after a while but the formula was
amazing and I kept meaning to go look at
that line and see if there were any
shades I actually would wear well I
finally looked this ones in the shade
4:49 creamy mauve and it is exactly that
it is this
gorgeous warm toned mauve color these
are insanely these are honestly even
more pigmented than those but this one
has a little bit of a kind of a sheen to
it just because it's not necessarily a
matte one they have little stickers on
some of these that said satin matte so
that's what this one is labeled us as
well the sticker came off with the price
tag but so that's what they consider
some of their shades and it is because
it's matte but it has that little bit of
a satin quality to it this is amazing it
looks amazing if you don't have this and
you're wanting like that trendy color
that everyone's talking about
get this one cuz it's so cheap and it's
so beautiful and the formula is amazing
and if you're looking for any other
shade look at this whole line because I
was like okay I'm already buying 20
lipsticks so I'm just gonna get one but
now I'm like well no I want to go back
so I don't know but this shade is
beautiful the very last thing I will
talk about is one that I'm really
excited about this is a Revlon Super
Lustrous
lip gloss and it's in the shade sky pink
and in their set up of all of these they
had a sticker on this that said new
shades so you know because this is an
older line they're not really coming out
with a ton of new ones but every once
while they are this is a new shade and
when I saw it I thought this looks like
Turkish Delight from NARS so I put them
to the test
get it out here oh I need to like oil
that geez
so I was like holding them next to each
other I'm like okay they're pretty close
they're a little bit off like this one's
a little warmer toned but they're pretty
close
so let's swatch them this one is Turkish
alight and this is the one that was like
made famous Kim Kardashian loved it a
long time ago so everyone bought and
lost their mind and I mean I have to
admit that's why I bought it so it does
this is Turkish light right there
it has just a little bit of a pink tone
to it but it is kind of sheer it's kind
of a milky color if you will so then
Revlon sky pink I'm gonna put right next
to it now this one when i swatched it
it really is just cooler tone but
they're almost the same so right here is
sky pink and right there is Turkish
Delight so you can see they're so close
to both that milky light pink but one is
warm one is cool would it be detectable
on the lips doubtfully I doubt you'd
really be able to tell the difference so
I would consider these a pretty darn
good dupe you know are they exactly no
of course not which that's how most
EWP's are but just so you know if you've
always been wanting this but you don't
spend the money because it's pretty dumb
expensive for what it is and frankly I
don't think the formulas anything
spectacular I've never wanted to go buy
more because I wasn't impressed I would
say the formulas are similar and the
shades are definitely in this formula
it's just it's just kind of a lip gloss
again I don't think there's anything
spectacular about the Revlon Super
Lustrous lip glosses
but I think they have a nice shade range
and they have a nice finish and so if
you're not picky about lip gloss they
don't feel overly sticky or overly thick
they're just kind of in between so I
thought that shade was absolutely
gorgeous definitely try it out if you've
been looking for one of those shades so
that was everything that I've bought
recently at the drugstore we're heading
into fall and I'm excited to see if any
other new lines of other from other
brands are coming out and definitely
gonna check those out if you enjoyed
