huge alcohol I hesitate to call it a
halt because they sent all this to me
and I guess I'm just on their PR list so
they send a lot of like new releases to
me which is so awesome because you guys
know I love elf so much and I do so many
reviews and demos with elf products
because they're amazing they really are
enough they're in they're so inexpensive
and people need to use the more because
they really are but of course in that
realm there sometimes does so I'm
excited to swatch some of these brand
new products to see are they actually
good are they kind of crappy and I mean
they send me some things that I've been
very honest with you guys like these are
terrible don't get them but then there
are other things that are amazing on my
lips right now is an elf product it's
their matte lip color it's their matte
lip color in fuchsia and I love it it's
just like a thicker pencil it glides on
it is so smooth I have a lot of color to
this that I've gotten from them but I
have also bought myself because they're
amazing
and know I'm not sponsored by them
they're not paying me anything I don't
have to show you this I just want see
alrighty so first of all one thing I was
very excited about I've been out of the
country and on my honeymoon for weeks so
I did some of this stuff and like didn't
even know was around they have these new
palettes there are four of them I think
they're supposed to be kind of similar
to the naked palettes I mean it's kind
of silly because we all compare
everything to them as if bourbon decay
invented nude shadows but it's such an
easy point of reference you know what I
mean where it's you know a palette
that's got a lot of colors so this is
the one that first caught my eye and
it's in the shade need it nude and it's
got one two three four five ten colors
on it and they're just beautiful let's
swatch I'm doing the gold one first
looks pretty good I'm going to do this
like kind of amber colored one let me do
like a matte okay so I've got them there
they look pretty good actually I don't
think they're as buttery is urban decay
and like the darker one is a little bit
powdery but they look like they're they
seem to be as I'm kind of blending them
they seem to actually be blendable
they're they have decent pigment and
honestly you guys sometimes I don't want
so much pigment upon touching it on my
eye because if I screw it up which I do
all the time
then I've got tons all over and I can't
get rid of it and I can't blend it away
because it's way too pigmented so that's
what's nice about these so that was
really nice the next one is called mad
format and these we'll call it like a
lot deeper colors and I of course will
link all these below for you guys if
you're curious about my prices and if
they have more shades in a certain range
or if you just wanna buy them so they're
all matte and they're it's got a good
range I was going to say it's darker but
really half of its pretty light or at
least almost half of it so oh they have
some interesting color choices in here
that I wouldn't necessarily gravitate
towards but I'm doing here
so they're they're a little powdery but
they are really pigmented still the next
one is called party ready they are
coming out so many different palettes
that's crazy I just got some of their
other palettes they have that are like
really really shimmery wonder if this
will be though if it's party ready whoa
this has some fun colors let me swatch
those really fun colors so those are the
three that popped the most to me I mean
okay they are powdery though but they're
nice and honestly for the price you can
never beat it because you're getting so
many color options and they are pretty
nice shadows honestly they're better
than what most of the drugstore brands
are coming out with right now just
saying and then this one is called
everyday smokey this made me think of
the Urban Decay smoky palette that just
came out except for this is way cheaper
did this actually
really really pretty okay whoo so some
of them are grainy er than others like
this third one in is was really kind of
grainy and rough but then his fifth one
in right there is really buttery so and
that's just the way most of this stuff
is let's see I'm running out of space
these are again really powdery but
really pretty there they are right there
really pretty this might be my favorite
and I wouldn't have guessed it but I
think it is that's beautiful
so they also sent me three more of their
matte lip colors yes this one is in hot
commodity I think these might be new
shades this one's like a bright coral
this would be awesome this summer and
look at it I love it this was not as
opaque as I'm used to with these but
really I mean after two swipes it is so
if you're willing to do an extra swipe
the next one is called dash of pig this
looks right up my alley I know I wear a
lot of bright well or deeper brighter
lips on camera but in person come on you
know I'm not going out all the time and
those lips sometimes though so - your
pink yeah it's just a little more
pinkish than that last one I've got a
little bit wait where did it go yeah got
a little bit more um just a little bit
lighter I think I love that that might
just be my everyday that might end up in
my teacher desk drawer this one is gonna
be amazing in the fall in winter it's
called berry sorbet and it looks like
it's a deeper purple but let's see how
it swatches what's not as deep as I
thought but again that's gonna be
beautiful in the fall oh my gosh I love
this formula you guys it is amazing and
I have heard yes that there's a little
sharpener on the other end so if you
just pull it out net sharpener I don't
really mean sharpener but it'll get it
pointed for you again and then you just
stick it right back in the next thing
they set is the elf blemish control face
primer this one I wonder because it's
green if it's a blemish control if it's
supposed to like combat redness before
you put your foundation on which
actually would be nice because I'm
always right on my nose you can even see
I got some Sun
we were on our honeymoon despite the SPF
yeah oh it's not agreement it comes out
but it's just supposed to fight yeah
it's just clear I mean you can't see it
um doesn't really have a smell or
anything it kind of has that silicone
feel but not really it's kind of a nice
feel it's like a cross between like a
lotion II primer and a silicone um you
know I'll give it a try I love the
packaging on those with the pump they
also set this got a glow lip tint and
this makes me think of the it cosmetics
one that it's just kind of like morphs
to your lips to be like a really nice
shade and that's what I think this is
cuz it looks kind of see-through if you
will yeah and you put it on it kind of
has a pink tint to it but it kind of
senses your temperature I guess I don't
know I like these kinds of things
because you don't have to really have a
mirror to put it on and ends up looking
nice no matter what your complexion is I
think that's pretty cool so yeah it's
kind of turning a little bit more of a
pink color they also sent me two of
their smudge pots I've done a video
reviewing the smudge pops that I had
before these so if you're in shouldn´t
that I can link it below but this one's
in cocoa QT I think these might be new
shades that they have and this is like a
deep brown that's nice so if you're
doing a really deep look I mean hey gosh
you can almost use it as like a brow
pomade if you needed it just just saying
I don't know if it stay in place
although this much pots do stay pretty
well and the other shade they sent what
wine not line isn't wine but it looks
again like kind of a burnished Brown oh
no this one's more of like a this makes
me think of toughest taupe no nut stuff
is so bad to the bronze from maybelline
color tattoos doesn't it kind of got the
grayish Brown tint to it that's actually
really really pretty
that when I have a feeling I will be
using they also sent they're blending
sponge now I am I don't know
I've never found a true dupe for a
beauty blender and this feels way too
dense way too dense but I will certainly
try it because you never know and it the
beauty blender isn't the be-all end-all
but and I'll be all but it's amazing and
there really is a difference between
when I use that to apply foundation
versus any other sponge but it's not the
only one that does the job so and I know
that but I will try it it'd be nice if
it worked it's certainly cheaper all
right the last things oh wow okay I'm
really excited with these so first of
all this is their perfect finish HD
powder
and it is sheer it says so yes and it's
all the mirror broke boo um but it's
just a sheer it does share but it does
leave like a white like if you have any
hair on your face you know I feel like
it might leave a white cast but then
again I'm heavily swatching it with my
finger so I think with the brush fanned
off and then maybe with the setting
spray on top this might be really nice I
actually do not own a single white
powder that's like an HD so I'm actually
really excited to give this a shot all
right
so these things I'm really excited about
these are their new palettes now they
have a foundation palette a bronzer
palette and a contour palette let's
start with the contour palette so
excited so it's four shades they're all
powder and I'm really excited about this
shade right there it looks like a
perfect yep
contour shade then there's one that's a
little bronzer and then there's lighter
ones for highlight hi the ones are
really buttery so there they are right
there this is such a perfect contour
shade oh my gosh I'm so excited to use
these the highlight shades are a little
powdery but once you get the powder off
it's beautiful so you know just practice
working with them but these are all
gorgeous I cannot wait that'd be the
perfect thing to travel it because I'd
have so many options in one fell swoop
you know the next thing is there let's
do their bronzer palette these are just
different shades of bronzer I feel like
they're always every Browns are out
there
so dark or so one way or another but
these are nice options they seem to
swatch okay it's hard to tell because
you know oh okay
they really are lighter which I mean a
fear of like me it's great but if you're
darker it's not really gonna work but
I'm really excited to give this a try as
well because especially when I'm trying
to bronze up in the winter I don't want
something crazy dark or super obvious I
just want to look like I've got a little
bit of a healthy glow to me I'm where
it's in the summer I don't need it as
much I'm oily and a mess so I don't know
I just don't mess around with it as much
alright and this last thing is their
foundation palette and fair splash light
okay so they've got a more yellow tinted
one there and then some more neutral
okay so let's just see I mean it kind of
reminds me of the same feel their
concealer palette so I don't you know I
don't know how different it would be but
they certainly all have a different tone
and you can see that so that's pretty
cool I wish I remember which one that
one is because that looks like a pretty
good match but I mean you could use
these to highlight certain areas which
is really nice to have like a cream
highlight and you have so many different
options so I think that's really
probably how I would use this so it's
not like a shimmery Nayla it's just a
true highlight just a lighter area of
your face so I'm so excited by all these
new things let me know what you want
reviews on first because that's kind of
the way I roll whatever you guys want to
see I will do so definitely check out my
other elf videos I've got a whole elf
playlist of different hauls I've done

out below subscribe if you enjoyed and I
will catch you guys in my next one
