share with you guys a quick slip swatch
and review and demo video of the new
Katy cap matte lipsticks from covergirl
so let's go ahead and get into it so I
have five of the eleven shades that they
offer these are priced $7.99 you can get
them on sale I know Walmart is selling
them and I think it's like maybe a
dollar cheaper there and of course
covergirl always has coupons as well so
definitely look out for sales and
coupons so let's talk about the shades
first and you'll see some swatches and
then we'll talk about the formula and
whether or not I would recommend it the
shapes that I have the first one I'll
show you is Sphinx this one's just a
really pretty light peachy pink daily
shade this is one that like I have worn
a lot since I bought it this week and
it's just such a classic everyday color
for me it's kind of a your lips but
better color and I just really like it
the next shade is called
Kat or like Couture but Kat alright and
this one's like a deeper version of the
one I just showed you it does have more
of a red pull to it
but it reminds me of kind of the same
color family in the packaging the swatch
kind of thing on the bottom looks
actually not that much darker than
Sphinx but you'll see in the swatch it
actually is much darker this is another
one I like but it's a little deeper than
I would typically wear for every day so
they have to be a very specific time
that I would wear it the next one and
the one that I'm actually wearing on my
lips right now is called kitty purry I
thought that was hilariously clever and
this one has more it's another lighter
kind of pink color but this one has more
of a blue cooler pool to it I love this
one this is one that can make your lips
look a little bit yellow so the warmer
tone ones don't as much but this cooler
tone more blue kind of does so this is
one that I'm actually not wearing it
with lipliner today because I wanted you
guys to kind of see what it looks like
but I think this one that will look
better with lip liner just to kind of
clean up the edges around your lips but
it is pretty it's a pretty color but you
do have to be the right skin tone for it
in my opinion the next one is kind of a
red one that I had to get
and it's called crimson cats and this
one is just a really pretty blue toned
red it
I love Red's like this where it's got a
little bit it's kind of right in between
but it does have a little bit more of a
cool tone to it and I think it just ends
up looking so beautiful I love this
shade of red it's a very Taylor Swift
kind of a red although she wears like
all versions of red the last I'm going
to show you is called maroon meow and
this one is it looks really deep in the
packaging and it is really deep but it's
certainly like a purple actually maroon
because maroon I mean that's very aptly
titled
it is a very deep maroon it's really
pretty though this is a really good fall
color again you definitely need a lip
liner with this or the red one that I
showed you but a really really pretty
fall or winter berry but like deep very
kind of a color but what I appreciate
about this color is that it's not like
that Brown that you know it looks great
on some people but not everyone this one
really is a true almost like grape juice
kind of a color so let's get into the
formula this is a it's marketed as a
Demi matte and so it's not completely
matte it's just kind of like more like a
satin matte type and I feel like it I
would agree it's certainly not a matte
but it's not super you know glossy or
anything like that I think that's a good
description of it however I don't think
it's very comfortable when you first put
it on it does glide on it does have a
feel of like and when you're doing the
swatch is obviously they're really
pigmented they glide right on but I
don't feel like they stay in place very
well I think they do better with the lip
liner and on top of that I just feel
like it kind of dries my lips out after
about an hour my lips feel really dry
not in the way that like a true like
matte matte would do but just in a way
that it just doesn't feel comfortable on
my lips whereas I feel like like the
Revlon Super Lustrous lipsticks I think
lasts a little better pack a little bit
more of a punch and they have like that
Demi matte in their line so I just I
just was not very impressed to be honest
and I was really sad to not meet that
impressed because the colors are
absolutely gorgeous and I love Katy
Perry but I feel like covergirl lip
sticks across the board I've tried a
couple that I like and I do have
in my question that I like but for the
most part the formula of their lipsticks
just isn't my favorite it always has
that same kind of slippery feel to it
where it ends up drying my lips out and
not really looking the way I expect it
to look that's just kind of my own thing
I know we all have our own opinions
about it
I wouldn't say totally stay away from
because I don't think it's a terrible
lipstick it's just not my favorite my
favorite shades are probably sinks that
first one I showed you that's really
kind of that lighter color right there
just because I love it this was in my
purse I wore it all week like I
mentioned so that's kind of how I know
it kind of dries them out a little bit
but I still really like the color and I
even like the look of it another one I
just think is a little bit more unique
is that kind of blue tone pink I think
that's not as seen right now and I think
it really is a pretty color so if you
have the right like especially if you're
Tanner than I am that would look so
beautiful and then I also I mean
honestly all of these are pretty I think
that grape juice kind of colored one is
just cool and the red one I like because
I just like Reds but if you don't like
red then probably wouldn't love it now
let's not go into packaging how cute is
this packaging it's the white and it's
kind of a matte feel to it like the NARS
packaging would have it does show dirt
easily but I mean you can pretty much
wipe it clean I think it is so cute the
way they did it and then on the other
side it says Katy Perry heart and then
covergirl and then of course it has
little kitty ears there above the title
I think the packaging they like nailed
it it is so cute these don't really have
a noticeable smell and I feel like a lot
of lipsticks in the drugstore do and
these don't so I applaud covergirl for
that because that can really turn a lot
of people off when there's a really
strong smell so that is good the wear
time on these is kind of so-so I mean
it's just the lipstick that you're just
gonna have to reapply throughout the
night if you're going out or throughout
the day so you know I mentioned that
after about an hour kind of wear down I
would say after a couple hours its
non-existent so you do have to reapply
and that's why I wouldn't necessarily
recommend the darker ones unless you
know you want to reapply them because
they're just gonna wear off kind of
wonky and drier lips out whereas with
the lighter ones it's not going to be as
obvious if it's wearing off so that's
just kind of my two cents on that so
hopefully this video was helpful for you
guys and I hope that you'll watch some
more of my lip swatch videos I have an
entire
your playlist I will link below of all
kinds of drugstore lip collections
swatched on my lips I hopefully go
subscribe to catch more and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
