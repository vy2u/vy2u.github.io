another haul from sleek but it's a haul
like I put it in quotes because they
sent me these things and I had been
telling you guys in my london-uk makeup
haul where I bought like Kiko products
and booyah and a couple other products
from the UK that this haul was coming
and they had sent me stuff so I was so
glad I didn't buy a sleek products there
in London coz they send me a bunch of
the things that I probably would have
bought so that worked out really well so
let's go ahead and get into it I'm going
to start with the numero uno best
product ever so if you only watch like 1
minute of this video you'll at least
know about this this is the highlighting
palette in solstice this is what you've
seen on Instagram everywhere that people
are losing their minds about and when I
saw pictures of it I was like why is
everyone dying over this like what so I
mean the colors are kind of interesting
choices but it's better than you would
ever imagine so let me swatch these so
we've got 3 powder so bright we've got 3
powders here that one that one and that
one
and then this one is a cream so let's
swatch them let's start with the cream
okay my hand is stained because of
course it is so there's the creamy one
oh my gosh there's here is the kind of
purplish powder here is the kind of like
almost orangish powder there's the
yellow like I'm kind of more not a
shimmery shadow shadow you know what I
mean so very impressed with this I'm
wearing the eye kind of mix those two
right there just a little bit on the
high points of my cheekbone so I really
like it they're crazy crazy shimmery the
yellow ones not as shimmery it's more
just well it's still shimmery but it's
not as like punch you in the face
shimmery and then the cream I really
have a mess
yeah I need to use a small like elf has
a small simple brush to kind of stipple
it on but very impressed the next
product is their i lost i shadow palette
and it's from the 24k gold collection
and it's in the shade the gold standard
this one I wasn't as impressed with um
it's an eye palette and some of them are
cream and some of them are shadow when I
swatch them I was impressed I was like
oh wow like especially when it comes to
creme shadows in a pan like this I feel
like they're never as good as I want
them to be they swatch really
beautifully however this color right
here looks terrible
and I can't stress that enough it's just
a really kind of clear just glitter in
the end and it looked terrible over
shadow under shadow I just was not
impressed the brown one though is
beautiful the powders are good I was
struggling to blend some of them that
would be my only downside again they
swatch gorgeously but that doesn't
always mean they're going to actually be
a great performing eyeshadow so they're
some of them are they really are pretty
but I just don't think they blend as
well as some of Sleeps other shadows so
out of the mix this is one that I like
and if you found a really good deal and
you were wanting to try it go for it but
it's not what I would recommend to
friends you guys are my friends the next
one is from sleek duh I'm sorry you guys
okay it's the mineral base eye shadow
palette i divine and it's the palette
called storm I'm wearing this today on
my eyes so it's got two four six eight
ten twelve shades here and I'm wearing
this kind of day on some maps and some
shimmers this matte color here all
throughout my crease then I'm wearing
this green on like the outer corner
blend it into this kind of golden yellow
and then I have this like shimmery
champagne color on the inner part of my
lid so the I had three shades on my lid
then that one they the one thing I wish
this palette had is like a matte light
color so I could do that under my brow
bone so I ended up pulling from I don't
even know what from another palette
- Matt white - put under my brow bone
but I was not the really nice they do
blend really well I was very impressed
with this much more so than I was with
this so definitely recommend that the
next thing they sent was this bear
kissed illuminator and it's in the shade
Monaco and I haven't even tried this yet
so it's in a pump I'm actually really
excited Oh came out quicker than I
thought
so it looks like oh wow that is so
beautiful so you'd have to be I mean it
has kind of almost like a whitish
pinkish tint to it so you have to be
careful with how much you apply and
where you put it you can't really be
sloppy with something like this but I
would almost blend it this much and then
take a stipple brush and stipple it on
so no matter what you know you're
getting kind of an even amount on your
brush if you've already blown it on your
hand that way because if you dip it into
a little glop that's not really blended
on your hand you're going to get globs
on your face I mean it's not going to
look as clean but I think if you do this
then dip it in and put it on just swirl
it onto the high points of your
cheekbone it's going to look beautiful
so that is really pretty you can even
put something like this under your
foundation not necessarily all over I
wouldn't but you can kind of
strategically place it where you want it
and then put your foundation on top of
it like stipple on and it would look
really pretty as well so this is one
that um you know it reminds me of like
the Becca illuminators it's a nice glass
bottle alright next things let's say
send me three of their lipsticks this
line is called the true color lipstick
and I have two Sheen's and one matte so
we'll let's start with the matte one the
matte ones in the shade papaya punch and
they're they're kind of short chubby
little things but it still has a decent
amount of product so this one oh well
it's got a lot of color it kind of is a
thin layer of color if that makes any
sense it's like a really thin formula
maybe I should say but that's really
pretty I could see that being really
really pretty in this summer and I don't
think I own anything like this because
it's not as bright as those like
red/orange lipsticks that are out right
now it's just kind of in-between I like
that it's different just different the
sheen ones this one's a
shades to come and it's got a lot more
moisture to it you can see but these are
crazy pigmented just that classic kind
of brown that 90s Brown it's pretty
though I would still wear it and it
feels comfortable I haven't worn these
yet but they feel comfortable swatching
them this is another sheen in the shade
cherry ooh that is my kind of a color
it's a verities a perfect name board I
would almost call it black cherry
because it's got more of a deeper tone
to it than just regular cherries dude
that is so beautiful again
crazy pigmented crazy creamy and of
course it makes sense that the sheen
ones are creamier than the matte one is
I get all cut up easily like when I
reach in my purse I don't know what's
wrong with me
but I swear like they're like sharp
objects in my purse that like cut my
knuckles up when I'm trying to find my
phone or my keys I don't what's wrong
with me I'm a mess even my student the
other day said did Pinocchio like bite
you and I'm like yes like it doesn't
matter how it happened it's mostly just
for reaching in my purse
the next lip product they sent me I have
some questions about it's called their
glitter me and ten sparkling lip gloss
and it's in the shade private jet it's
this pink with like purple glitters in
it umm I will never wear this I'm gonna
be real with you guys it it's too
glittery it's too glittery I would
constantly be worried that the glare was
falling all over the place I mean I will
try it it's not that I'm not going to
try it but I can pretty much with
confidence tell you right now it's good
it's a pretty color but it's just not
really my taste and I've even heard Tati
she had a different color of this it was
like a more neutral color and that was
just like just glitter so she wasn't
impressed with that either I kind of
feel her there although this one does
have color and glitter but I just not a
color I will wear okay the next one is
one of their cream to powder blushes in
the shade carnation and it really is you
it is a cream to powder it's not like a
straight-up cream it's got kind of that
that texture if you've ever felt cream
to powder where it's like a matte cream
it's just bizarre really really pretty
color these are gorgeous I mean this
would be beautiful in the spring I use
the
the other day with the stipple brush and
I had way too much on I look like a
clown so you do have to be careful and
aware
I you know I figured it'd be pigmented
but not that pigmented it was so now I
know just to use a lighter hand it's a
really pretty color really interesting
formula I'm definitely gonna use this
some more and let you guys know how it
is but I liked it and I like the color
they sent the last thing I haven't even
opened this is their oh la la EA you oh
oh la la liner in doir so it's just a
black I hate when I'm just painting my
nails and I'm faced with something too
open
alright sometimes I just look at it and
I'm like hello Himura unlock that kind
of works right it says it's waterproof
and smudge-proof and it's it you can
tell it's kind of that crap okay
I'm trying to be positive you guys I
feel that I don't like being negative
about a bunch of products I would sent
for free but I've got to be honest with
you guys this one it looks kind of gray
and when I want a black black liner I it
better be so black I can't even see in
it that's a little better i layered it
but it's still I wish you could see it
in just like daylight it still has this
tone that's not quite black so again I
will try it and if you just like darker
colors than you would mind but for me
I've been so spoiled like Jordanna and
Milani both make amazing liners that are
crazy jet-black and they don't move so
it's a similar formula like this where
it doesn't move hopefully but it's even
blacker so I was hoping for something
even darker maybe this app isn't like
this is called noir but maybe it's not
meant to be black black maybe it's meant
to just be a really deep color so it's
still a nice formula I can tell but I
just wish it were darker that's all um
anyway so those were all the things I
got from sleek I'm so excited to try
some of them I mean just to kind of
reiterate some of the standout products
this illuminator is seems amazing the
lipstick seemed really nice I really
liked the storm palette and I really
really liked the what was it called
again the highlighting palette so I mean
there were some wonderful products that
are out from sleek I will link them all
down below if you're
interested in any of them and hopefully
you'll subscribe to catch more for me
and I will catch you guys in my next one
