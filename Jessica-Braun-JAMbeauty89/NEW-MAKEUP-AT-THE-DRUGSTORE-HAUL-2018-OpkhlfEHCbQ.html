like I've got like too much saliva in my
mouth you guys are like I think I anyway
today we're doing a drugstore haul this
is old school and I always call some of
these halls old school because don't you
miss the day's like if you've been
watching YouTube for years and years
like so much of what is sent to all
youtubers myself included is PR and
that's wonderful when it comes to being
able to get reviews out there things
like that but at the same time there's
something to be said of you know going
to a store and buying things that you
picked out and so like for me I love
watching youtubers talk about like
genuinely being at the store and picking
things out so and if you're new to
YouTube you probably have no idea what
I'm talking about but regardless so I
was at a store near me called Meijer
which is like it's a grocery store
superstore kind of a place in some areas
of the Midwest it's where we shop for so
so much
I wish it were worldwide because I feel
bad that I talked about it but they
always get new releases pretty quickly
and so I was just there strolling and
Tyler was with me and we roll in the
aisles I'm like there's so much new
stuff there was new all new stuff new
covergirl stuff new door everyone stuff
oh oh I already said all my L'Oreal
Milani I mean so much so I am so excited
I bought a bunch of the stuff I'm
wearing a bunch of it today as well
let's go ahead and get into it oh and of
course if you enjoyed this kind of video
I hope you'll subscribe and stick around
again okay now for real first thing just
to get it out of the way I bought a
little tiny thing of Vaseline lip
therapy I have been carrying around a
tub of Vaseline because my lips were
like when burned from our trip to Disney
it was just kind of windy and my lips
got so wind burnt and so I'd been using
just Vaseline but I was like I kind of
want a smaller tub and I figure I could
even clean this out when it's done and
put more Vaseline in it I would have to
assume this is just Vaseline they maybe
added another ingredient or two although
I don't see an ingredients list so I've
kind of maybe this it I don't know
regardless um
Vaseline it's irreplaceable when it
comes to things like that like mice I
think two of my sisters use Vaseline
exclusive
on their lips and I think from what I've
learned about Vaseline it's not
necessarily that Vaseline itself has
like healing properties it's more that
it protects your lips from all the
environmental factors out there and
because of that your lips can kind of
heal themselves with that protective
barrier on does that make sense that's
how I've been kind of taught that it
works I don't know if that's a hundred
percent true regardless there's no
replacement for it so anyway very
excited to have a tiny one all righty
let's start with the thing that I was
like genuinely probably out of all of
this the most excited about and that
would be these pallets from all May I
only bought one but I and I think I only
saw two so I would assume they only have
two out this is called natural ISTA and
it's very very neutral I would say a
much cooler tone palette but again I've
been telling you guys I'm kind of
getting into more cooler toned looks
lately I've been doing a lot of warm
tone for a long time and I am a neutrals
girl through and through of course I'm
saying that and I have like blue is
yummy I was just trying something new
today and poor Tyler had to deal with my
wrath because I'm like trying this blue
eyeshadow and then I'm putting lashes on
and like the last I was putting on we're
ridiculous looking on me so then I've
got glue everywhere and what so we came
in I'm like what I'm sorry I'm losing it
over here trying to do my makeup today
anyway wow that was a tangent as usual
but here's what I'll say about this this
whole haul it's all gonna be I've only
used all of these products a couple of
times so this truly is just my first
impressions but I will plan to do a haul
update as I usually do maybe in a month
or two months time that way you can see
like okay now that I've used it for
quite a while
here's genuinely my review of it and if
I think it's worth buying or not
depending on if you need it but I still
wanted to give my thoughts on this so
the shimmers this is a very classic
drugstore palette and I don't mean that
in a mean way because I found tons of
drugstore palettes that I like I think
you can get decent pigmentation with it
but it kicks up a lot of powder now the
other thing is there are crazy expensive
palettes like like the natasha do no no
palette that kicks up a ton of
and yet it's still really expensive and
it's still really high quality I mean it
is I don't know why I put it in quotes
but you know so I can't always knock a
product because of the powdery kickback
I'm kind of learning that as I try more
and more and more but you do need to be
careful with it now I am wearing a
little bit of this obviously the blue
shadow is not from in here but like I'm
wearing this deeper brown in my crease
to kind of blend that blue together the
nude I'm wearing on my brow bone and I
put it down before I put the blue on and
I think I used a little of this kind of
neutrally light color it's like a gray
almost to kind of blend some of this
stuff together so I like the palette
I've only used it a handful of times I
think it's better than like the
covergirl no not the covergirl what was
the ones that I hate it was a Maybelline
ones I hated that one it was like the
wrote was it the rose no that's I'm
thinking of Caro the covergirl ones if
you're good
they remind me of this all are all being
covergirl owned by the same company I
feel like these are the same exact
formulas because this feels a lot like
those cover crop outs and I like those
and I would recommend those so those are
my initial two thoughts I think it's
worth looking into again they're
overpriced all of the drugstores just
deciding it's like they all met together
and they said hey guys I know we've been
charging like five to nine dollars for
everything let's charge like ten to
twenty dollars now because everything
and I think literally everything I
bought was easily around thirteen
fourteen fifteen dollars each and I'm
like this is getting crazy like it's
getting genuinely expensive so that's
kind of heartbreaking but that's why I'm
here to tell you guys what's worth your
money and what's not especially as
prices get higher alright so I saw that
covergirl had this whole new line I
think I bought everything it's they're
healthy they're vitalists healthy line
so there's like some highlighters a
little like luminizing lotion a shadow
base a powder and a setting spray at
least that's all I saw at my store so I
thought it all I'm sorry haven't you
solve this and I'm wearing
of it today so the powder I'm wearing
this is their vitalist healthy powder I
got in the shade 710 classic ivory it
kind of looks a dark and I will say like
I put it on and obviously I'm decently
fair it's definitely a little too dark
for me it works just fine I will say
this though I am a huge proponent of
putting a sponge into this and kind of
applying it that way because it really
covers especially if you have a nose
like mine that's got redness that keeps
through throughout the day and this is a
very it's got a high coverage but it's
nice and thin and I think that's pretty
cool because it doesn't end up looking
too too cakey I mean it's still a powder
it's still going to show up as a powder
in light this is no different but I was
kind of pleasantly surprised with this
so if you can find your shade I think
it's worth it they didn't seem to have
very many shades in this range I don't
know if they're kind of testing the
waters see how it does before they
formulate new shades I don't know I also
got their vitalist go glow luminizing
lotion I really like the packaging
they're do with this this simplified
white and black I don't know I just like
that more minimalist kind of look so
this is definitely something you could
mix in with a primer or foundation I
honestly love luminizing lotions I use
one a couple times a week and I like to
just put them all over my face before I
put on my foundation because I think you
know if you've got dry or even normal
skin and you like that kind of dewy look
but not like crazy like wet look this is
the perfect way to do it because your
foundation is gonna tone down most of
this but it still leaves a little bit to
be seen from underneath and that's what
that's the way I always use these kinds
of products and honestly I feel like a
lot of these are kind of created equal
they're not you know they're not meant
to be worn alone as like a strip of
highlight you know it's really is meant
to be either mixed in or worn underneath
but you know there's a little bit of
that moisturizing lotion type quality to
these types of products and I did like
it this was in the
shade number one daybreak so this one I
was wearing yesterday I'm actually just
really quickly gonna talk about a
L'Oreal product and that's actually what
I'm wearing underneath my foundation
this is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi glow
ssin and I have it in the shade 901 and
I think I like this one a little bit
more it is a little bit of a lighter
tone but I think it packs a little bit
more of a punch then that one does and
that could be because of my skin tone
you know this is much fairer than I am
and that's why it made me looks but I'm
wearing it underneath and I feel like it
did do a good job I'm gonna tell you
right now I have three foundations to
tell you about and it was miserable
maybe that's what put me in the bad mood
and I'll talk about it in a second but
putting on the front my foundation today
was miserable I can't wait to tell you
but I was putting it on top of this and
I think this at least looked really nice
we'll get there anyway so I think out of
the two I would recommend the L'Oreal
one over this I think it was just a
little bit I don't know it felt a little
more luxurious going on my skin as well
like I feel like it really blended in
and I went I went to the bathroom really
quickly right after I put this on before
foundation and I was looking in the
mirror and I was like I feel like I
could wear just this and no foundation
my skin looked so healthy and glowy and
even though there were little spots I
would definitely want to conceal that's
like the only time I've ever thought
that in my life about like anything so
that was weird and I do want to try that
someday soon maybe maybe this weekend
just to see like how does that look
because it was so many thing Chloe but
it wasn't too much anyway I'll shut up
but I really like the L'Oreal one best
so I also got the covergirl look lock up
all day setting missed the mister on
this is pretty good actually it's nice
and fine I mean they know that we're all
snobby but head's about it and if they
had come out with a sprayer that was
subpar we would have all not had
anything to do with it like no one
would've bought it it has a very strong
smell it's like a floral cucumber e
maybe kind of a smell may be more like
melon cucumber I don't like that smell I
mean not enough that I won't
use it but it's certainly not my cup of
tea I know a lot of people like that
kind of a smell
I'm definitely fresh definitely a fresh
smell it was okay I mean it's hard to
say with the setting spray until I've
used it for a long time exactly my
thoughts but I can at least tell you
that the mister is nice it definitely is
a fragrance so if you don't like
fragrance I might say way I like that
there's 3.4 fluid ounces I feel like
some of these setting sprays have like
less than that and I'm like seriously
like I just spent an arm and a leg on
you because again even at the drugstore
these are expensive so I appreciate that
but also that still makes it travel
friendly if you wanted it we're getting
to the foundations I've got two more
covergirl products before I talk about
the other stuff um so I got their lid
lock up
covergirl lid lock up it's an eyeshadow
primer I did use it today I think it's
pretty good it's kind of a beige color
it's a little bit tacky but I do have to
wonder how it would perform for someone
with oily eyelids cuz I think for me I
never really have too many issues with
creasing my lids are just very normal I
do have little bits of like kind of
wrinkles if you will but that usually
doesn't affect the creasing but I think
if you had really oily eyelids I don't
know how this would work so if you have
oily eyelids and you've tried this let
us know below if someone else is kind of
contemplating buying it
I just it's okay I'll use it up but
would I repurchase it I feel like I
already I like a thicker eye primer so
like the ones you squeeze out of a tube
I like that better I feel like it holds
onto my shadow lot better make some more
vibrant now for the blue portion of my
eye look today I put on like a white eye
primer that I padded just on the lid to
make it really pop this would not have
done that I'll tell you that right now
so I do think it's good if you have if
there's a sale and you need an eye
primer you have a coupon absolutely I
would say it's it's a good primer is it
the best what I've tried no all right so
kind of a dud already is the covergirl
vitalist healthy glow I bought two
shades number one and number three so
these are meant to be a highlighter okay
I'm wearing this one today I think it
looks okay however
you have to work fast to not make this
like like for example it feels like
almost like the putty like a structured
putty and I thought oh maybe it'll be
kind of like the RMS beauty like living
Luminizer it's like a little pot kind of
a clear glossy looking highlighter you
can just tap they're so beautiful I love
it certainly more expensive than this
probably at least double the price but
it actually packs a little bit more of a
punch than that which am i cool nothing
that's awesome but I tried applying it a
couple ways I tried applying it with my
finger and I was like okay it's not
blending in so I grabbed my sponge
quickly to blend it in it was already
set like I'm telling you seconds it was
already set where it was so I if it
looks like I have a strip I mean I feel
like I do and every time I look in the
mirror like I told you I did not have
fun getting ready today
it was so upset but the biggest gripe I
have with this however is that there's
definite definite glitter in this and I
know that many people love that and if
you do then you know this will be your
cup of tea but if you're like me I don't
I don't like that I like glitter an
eyeshadow but for it to be in my
highlight I think it ages me just a
little bit because it really highlights
those areas and it's not as neat as what
I want it to be you don't have saying
glitter can tend to I don't know catch
the light weird and not in the way I
want it to so it just sets quickly and
it has glitter so you've got to know
yourself I'm the other shade I'll show
you anyway this one doesn't seem to have
glitter this one's a little bit too no
to see this one I feel like doesn't have
glitter so the shade number was this
three
yeah shade number three that's not so
really it's just number one that you
need to look out for I don't know about
whatever number two is but this one's a
little bit deeper it's really really
pretty I would like to use it as an
eyeshadow honestly but these I mean
they're okay do I would I recommend them
no no I just wouldn't the more I think
about I'm like no I really wouldn't
there's better
out there okay I've got like five more
products to talk about let's talk about
the foundations so the one that gave me
so much heck
today was the Revlon Photoready insta
filter foundation I actually bought this
a while ago I did not buy this one at
the same time about all of these this
one I've probably had maybe a couple
weeks but I hadn't broken it out
actually opened it and used it so I
decided to use it today I have it in the
shade 130 porcelain it's a little light
for me but it's probably the closest
I'll get to my shade so you open it
there's this real weird sponge you know
okay I can get past it so you twist the
bottom and foundation comes out the top
so you can kind of oh my gosh that was a
lot you can kind of stamp it out of
there you could kind of rub it on your
face you can't use this sponge to
actually blend it in so if you're
looking at it thinking oh no absolutely
not but what I did is I just kind of
stamped it I just started on my cheek
just wanted to see how it looked and
then I grabbed a sponge to actually
blend it in it had very light coverage
which okay not that big of a deal if
that's what you're looking for but if
you are looking for higher coverage stay
away from this one you won't like it but
if you tried to layer a little more on
to have a little more coverage it would
get caught in the weirdest spots like I
had weird like dots all along my
forehead it was like stuck in my eyebrow
and there have been a few foundations
I've tried within the past a year that
have done that and I'm like I can't
stand it because there's almost no way
to fix it unless you just rate it wipe
it off or you know I'm using the the
clean end of the sponge or I'm grabbing
brushes and you can kind of make it work
but once a lot of it is set it's set
unless you completely start over or wipe
the whole area off if you have a job
that you need to get ready for quickly
in the morning or whatever you probably
don't have the time to start over you
know especially if you like do your eyes
first and then
anyway so with that in mind I was just
so frustrated because I'm like is that
my skin and like I don't feel and you
can still see a little bit I don't know
that it was very unflattering just
really unimpressed and again this was
freaking creeping up above $15 from what
I remember so I I would not recommend it
I honestly don't know that I even want
to use it again I might maybe try one
more time and use just a brush and see
if maybe the brush or my fingers but
well that was not fun so one that I put
basically on top of it today and what
you're pretty much seeing on my face
today is the new maybelline superstay
full coverage foundation this definitely
has way more coverage I have it in the
shade 110 porcelain again a pretty good
match for me
it definitely is full coverage I applied
it with a sponge and I think it looked
nice is it totally flawless not really
isn't my favor and a shin not really but
it's it pretty darn good
yes and if you're looking for a more
affordable maybe with the coupon
foundation I would say absolutely this
is one of the better ones at the
drugstore some of the full coverage ones
that the drugstore can really cling to
dry patches if you have dry skin like me
especially in the winter time but this
one wasn't as bad and for that I really
do appreciate it so again I want to try
this out some more and see how I feel
about it
another one I picked up was the all May
best blend forever makeup this also is
one ounce but it feels so light compared
to the August cuz it's plastic but yet
again it has a sponge what's going on
like why is everyone is everyone into
this like I'm not I think it's weird and
I get maybe it's you know kind of new
and gimmicky but you squeeze this one I
almost forgot how to do it and it comes
up so I think I like the squeezed better
anyway it doesn't matter but this one I
actually kind of liked however
they really don't have a good shade
range all Mei is notorious for that and
I don't know like I did actually like it
so if you could find your range now
again this is not super high coverage
the coverage is probably on par with the
Revlon maybe a little bit better but it
just for my dry skin made my skin look
somewhat healthy and I liked it so it
kind of reminded me more of a BB cream
Vanna Foundation best blend I mean I did
think it blended decently well again is
it a favorite of mine I'm not sure yet I
want to use it some more but but it did
look nice and it does have SPF of 40
which i think is pretty cool too next
thing I picked up from all May's new
line is there liquid lash extenders
mascara this is a very standard
drugstore mascara I think it's pretty
good but again I found too many more
amazing foundations like the essence
lash princess the lash paradise mascara
all of those are so much better than
this
I find it hard to recommend it you know
but it's okay
that I like the brush kind of more of a
natural bristle brush very you know
known for kind of volumizing
what I noticed about it the few times
I've used it so far is that it kind of
it definitely hardens once it's dry
which a lot of mascaras do but my
favorite ones don't and it's funny
because my favorite ones that I just
mentioned they don't really harden too
much and they hold a curl better so it's
it's like huh the hardening you almost
wonder if it's like weighing them down I
don't know you think it would hold the
curl better so I don't think it held a
curl very well it volumizes
okay but again not anywhere near what
those other two mascaras do in terms of
volume and separation and holding a curl
so for that reason I don't think it was
like a terrible mascara I think you know
I went through the day and I would check
in the mirror I'm like it looks okay I
mean it didn't change a ton from when I
put it on but I didn't love the way it
looked after putting it on anyway and I
put on maybe two I think I tried for a
third and it was like pretty dry and I'm
like a so just kind of standard another
product is this Milani instant touch-up
blur stick this in my head was going to
be similar to the milk makeup blur stick
and it really is it's a little bit more
of a thinner consistency
only has that kind of velvety feel when
you rub it between your fingers it's
totally transparent the way I used it
today is just on my nose and in this
area basically anywhere you have pores
that you want to kind of fill in kind of
smooth the area out I think it did
pretty well if you're on a budget you
know you don't need to go buy the milk
makeup stick I think it's pretty good
but I don't think it's like
earth-shattering like oh my gosh your
pores are there I think it helps with
your pores but I think this does - do I
think they're exact dupes for each other
no they're definitely a different
formula but a very similar effect at the
end of the day which is really what
you're going for with your makeup look
right so those were all of the new
products that I've purchased recently
every one so I'll go to the drug store
and purchase little things here and
there and I don't always haul them so
there's a lot more than I'm kind of
trying that I might not have mentioned
in a video but if there's anything new
out there that you would love for me to
pick up and review for my channel please
let me know down below and I hope that
you will subscribe and like the video if
you did and I'll see you guys my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
