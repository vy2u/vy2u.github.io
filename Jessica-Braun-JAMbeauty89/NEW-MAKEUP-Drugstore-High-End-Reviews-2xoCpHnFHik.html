a video of a bunch of new products and I
wanted to share with you guys some of
them that I think are really really good
that just recently came out and some
that I think are kind of math they're
not total misses and I'll explain why
but they're really not something that I
would say you guys need to run out and
go buy so there's a good mix I would say
it's mostly drugstore with a handful of
high-end products so I will link
everything that I mentioned down below
if you are interested in checking them
out further and other than that I hope
you'll subscribe let's go ahead and get
into it
you like my hair looks weird today it's
one of those days that I kind of dry
shampooed and I was like we're gonna put
it inside ponytail cuz I just like let
it air dry as well and so just like in a
weird space just no weird space alright
oh also I want to show you guys this
totally random and we were at IKEA the
other day and I found these I'm using
some of them so usually it's fuller
these like gold coasters for like 5
bucks and it has the holder here and
they're you know they're not like super
well-made but it's like metal and then
like the foam on the bottom and I
thought they were so cute like for my
little room here cuz I do have a wooden
desk and I don't want to completely ruin
it so I just thought that was so fun
they were like 5 bucks if I can find a
link to that I'll link it below the
first product I wanted to mention that I
was like what like how do you use it is
this one I went out bought this
it's the Maybelline master fairy
highlight by face studio illuminating
powder it says create a magical glow
with the master fairy highlight
illuminating power powder apply with the
sponge sweep the sponge along the
rainbow and apply onto cheeks for a
magical glow I do not understand how
this works now if you're one of those
people that you love like things like
this and you'll totally rock it and pull
it off every day that's awesome I am NOT
that person and I know that a lot of
people out there just that's just not
your style so if you swirl the whole
thing together which is not how they say
to do it but if you did swirl it all
together you get this kind of bluish
greenish toned definitely an iridescent
highlight but it's Bluegreen okay so if
I were to just kind of here let me kind
of
clean it up so if I were to just swipe
it this way like you would with a sponge
so you can get all of the different
colors you do see a rainbow which is
really freakin cool but when you
actually go to like swipe it you still
only see like the blue I'm gonna try it
again okay you can kind of see the
rainbow
it's tricky cuz of how I'm doing it I
know yeah it's still mostly blue let me
see if I can get a little of the lower
spot okay if you focus lower you can get
a little more the yellow regardless this
ends up being this wild look that it
just made me laugh cuz I'm like it's a
really cool fun product to look at but
in actuality unless you are that very
specific person that likes that kind of
a style on your face it's gonna be very
hard to pull off in everyday settings if
you're like me I mean I just felt like
you know I could get down with this if
it were maybe shimmery err and less
pigmented color wise because it's so
pigmented color wise it just for me is
impossible to wear whereas if it were
just more shimmery with the hints of
these colors I think I'd be more likely
to try it but I've swept this onto my
cheekbones like a couple mornings and
every morning I'm like oh no this looks
crazy on me so if you found a way to
wear this let us know I'm not I mean you
could maybe use these as like shadows or
something fun or for Halloween but yeah
just a product that I felt like mm I
feel like it kind of missed the mark
the next product that I recently
actually L'Oreal sent me these and I try
a lot of products from drugstores and
they sent and a lot of them I don't like
I usually tell you this was one that I
did there is a product that Physicians
Formula is something that I didn't
really like I'll show you in a sec as
well but I've always honest regardless
of if they're sent to me if you've
watched me for a while you already know
that these are their infallible paints
metallics eyeshadows and so I have three
shades that I pulled out that I was like
oh my gosh these are amazing and I've
tried them like even on my snapchat when
I get ready early in the morning I was
share with you guys what I'm doing and
show you the process and I was like oh
oh goodness like these are so amazing so
they're so buttery they have this cool
like honeycomb design on them look at
these look at these freaking colors
don't these look like Urban Decay
shadows these are absolutely just like
urban decay shadows just that ridiculous
shimmer it's so pigmented so the colors
I have here are 400 rose chrome as this
one here on the bottom it's kind of a
rose gold I've been wearing that just
all over my lid a lot then I have the
darker color in the middle is 404 caged
which is this beautiful darker color and
then the golden one is called brass
knuckles right there these are so
gorgeous like I said I think the
packaging is cool but the pigmentation
and the wear time is amazing I've worn
all of these separately and honestly
these are those kinds of shadows that
you can just put a one shadow look
together you just put the shadow on
blend it and decrease and that's it and
they just look so gorgeous they stay in
place they catch the light beautifully
cannot believe these are drugstore well
yes I can cuz I found plenty through the
years of amazing products but always
excited when we find a really good
drugstore eyeshadow that is awesome so
highly recommend these ok the next thing
is a more high-end one this is the Too
Faced peach blur translucent smoothing
finishing powder packaging gorgeous they
sent me their whole collection there are
a lot of things I was underwhelmed by
and a lot of things I was so surprised
how much I liked this was one of the
ones I was so surprised how much I liked
because at first I was like wait why is
it like shimmery peach why would I want
that as an all-over powder you know what
I'm saying but when you swatch this it's
got this kind of iridescent peachy tone
to it I don't know how this would look
if you have really deep skin I don't
know if it would end up being kind of
translucent the way it does on mine or
if it would look ashy because it's so
much lighter I don't know but it just
ends up blending in and so it doesn't
end up look
peach on your skin even though I've been
using this elf powder brush that I love
and every time I feel like I see here
I'll just show you when I swirl it in
there like that is definitely peach but
then when I put it on it just looks so
beautiful like it doesn't I just love it
it blurs your stuff together so if
you've got weird patchiness going on
with like your blush and stuff I'll use
this to kind of blend it together and I
feel like it just kind of makes it look
more seamless I'll use this when I have
a little bit of unevenness with my
foundation I'll use this like especially
in this region and it just kind of
cleans it up it's such a cool product I
don't really know how it does it but it
really it's just beautiful it is a
powder it's not like those blurring
things that are like a wax this is a
powder but I just ended up loving it the
packaging feels really high-end so it
makes you feel like yes this is worth
the money you know what I mean but I
just think the product inside is so cool
kind of innovative in its own way it
reminds me I guess in a way of the
hourglass powders but it's a very
different maybe it's a similar look at
the end of the day but it's a very
different powder I feel like the
hourglass ones are even thinner and it's
just you know they're not necessarily
peach tone but regardless I love this so
much alright continuing on a drugstore
one that I am obsessed with is this
Maybelline master blush by face do I
have to tell you this I hauled this
recently in an Ulta haul and you guys
are like wait I thought you said you
weren't gonna buy any more blush
palettes and I was like dang you right
girls you right but then I was like but
it was so pretty so this one is in the
shade 10 and it's got these berry tones
right here and then this peach tone and
then like the highlight the highlights
alright it's not bad I shouldn't say it
that way it's not bad I feel like for
the highlight if you mix it's a little
bit more of a subtle one it's like if
you mix the laura mercier like baked
radiance powder that I love that I cause
it's very subtle if you mix that with
like a really pigmented one you get this
one because it's like right in between
so I don't hate it but it's not one that
I'm like dying to use but these blushes
are so gorgeous they
blend really well I think the colors are
so pretty together I mean I'm not
wearing them together but they're all
three so pretty they're not insanely
pigmented like if I were to compare I
was just talking in another video today
talking about these blushes from the
balm these are those are like insanely
pigmented these are not that insanely
pigmented
however because of that you can't really
screw them up so when you're applying
them with a brush you they always look
nice they never look like patchy or like
way too pigmented they're kind of right
in the middle so it's really hard to
screw them up and I appreciate that so
if you're a beginner or if you're like
me and you're like gosh my blush always
ends up looking crazy because I go to
ham on it this is the answer for you but
I still think even though these aren't
crazy pigmented they're just beautiful
I think they blend pretty well together
I think it's cool that you get all of
these together since they're actually
all wearable and all really good the one
that maybe is not as wearable for me is
the berry toned one but if you have
darker skin tone holy moly that would be
beautiful I've worn this with a light
hand you can still pull it off it
reminds me in a way of sin from NARS huh
it's kind of similar to sin you can kind
of see sin there see but NARS ones don't
even swatch that well and they're
beautiful too so not all amazing blushes
swatch amazingly so totally recommend
this it totally threw me for a loop
because I thought you know I might like
it but I ended up loving it let's talk
about a product that I was like mmm and
these are brand new positions for me to
sent me these the other day I got them
in the mail they are their new butter
highlighters there are four that they
sent I think there's four on the line
but they're they're Muru Muru butter
highlighters they have four shades the
white one is called pearl the kind of
rose gold one is called rose gold the
pink one is called pink gosh and the
kind of lighter gold is called champagne
so my grape at first was I was like well
which one like if you're my skin tone
which one would you buy as a highlight
and I thought well these three are all
too dark for me and so I thought well I
guess the one in Pearl however the one
in Pearl is so white
and because it's this creamy formula I
mean they had that cool like butter
texture to them and then you swipe them
and they're kind of like the color pop
highlighters but creamier and this is so
pretty but it's so white so then I
thought well maybe I can use like the
gold one maybe that's light enough and
again these are all so creamy so
pigmented they're all the same exact
formula so pigmented but I thought maybe
but I tried that and it was just too
gold so today what I did is I took the
white and I just patted it in this
region and then I took a damp sponge and
kind of blended it in I think it looks
nice I think you can make it work
however it's so much more work than what
I want to spend on something like this
and physician's formula is drugstore but
it's still kind of on the higher end of
drugstore you know their stuff is
usually over ten dollars obviously there
are sales which is awesome so that's the
time to take advantage but let me go
ahead and swatch for you the other ones
because I think you just have to be the
exact right skin tone for one of these
shades to make it work so this one's in
pink and I would say you could maybe
wear this as a blush
but they're so creamy that I would worry
that they would just get everywhere that
they would go everywhere and then let's
go ahead and do the rose gold this one's
more of a bronze to be honest with you
and now it's like rose gold look at the
pigment I mean they're gorgeous creamy
but like I said you've just got to find
the one that matches you correctly and
like for me I really can't but I know
some people are gonna find a perfect
match and you're gonna love these so
they are cool they're really the the
packaging is kind of like that I don't
know do you call it just iridescent or
holographic I know it's some of you guys
like really know the difference I think
I might call this I think it'd be
holographic I don't know you guys tell
us below I'm sure some of you guys were
like it's this so it's not a total miss
because it is an amazing formula but I'm
just not sure also how to use it
that makes it worth using now I did try
the was at the rose gold one on my
snapchat the other morning before work I
put it on my eyelid just as an eyeshadow
I was like I wonder how it wears I wore
an eye primer under it and about ten
hours into the day I did take a nap like
when I got home from work so that could
have done it and I didn't notice it
before a nap so maybe it was a nap but
there is horrible creasing and I thought
okay I never get creasing on my eyelids
I've been very blessed I guess but I
never get creasing there and so for me I
was like this is just weird to see cuz I
never so I don't know if it was because
this is so darn creamy and obviously
it's not meant for your eyes it did look
really pretty though so I was like dang
it was really pretty
it looked like a dupe for Indian wood
from Mac that I loved anyway so those
are my thoughts on these alright couple
more things a favorite of mine is this
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
concealing pot as far as I know these
are new for it cosmetics they've had the
by under I like squeezy tube of
concealer and it's so high coverage it's
too high coverage for most people now
for some people you need that much
coverage and it looks gorgeous I like
the I think it's a good concealer if you
have a need for that high of coverage
but for me I don't yet so this oh my
gosh like what is the shade I have I'm
using light and it's just you know a
classic pot but it's so creamy but it
actually blends in like I feel like it's
not so creamy that it blends away but
it's not so dry that it just looks dry
it's the perfect formula I don't know
they nailed it and because of that I
feel like it does a great job of hiding
my under-eye circles but it sinks into
fine lines only a little bit every
concealer I use does but not so much
that I'm like okay this is a bad
concealer it just does it kind of a
normal amount for me but I think it's
such a nice shade I end up loving the
look when I when I use this I feel like
my under eyes are so brightened it stays
that way all day I real
really like this stuff okay this one is
not as new but I wanted to mention it
anyway because I've been using it so
much for months that I feel like no
one's talked about any more and they
still should be this is the covergirl
healthy elixir foundation it's got
vitamins it says it's got SPF of 20
sunscreen I wear the shape classic ivory
the packaging is pretty it is they
nailed the packaging but this is I'm
wearing this today I feel like it makes
my skin look healthy it stays in place
pretty well as long as you've got a good
primer and for me I never feel like I'm
clogging my pores when I put it on and I
don't know if that's true or not maybe
it's a placebo effect cuz I'm like oh
it's healthy elixir and so you get that
in your mind that oh it's healthy for my
skin but I feel like I haven't had like
any breakouts since I've been using this
stuff a lot and I feel like it's a good
shade match for me too which always
helps me like a product more but I just
I really like this foundation I've used
it with a brush that's how I applied it
today I've used it with a sponge many
times I think I like it better I don't
know if I like it better which way I
like it both ways it just looks so
pretty it's got kind of medium coverage
I think it's a little bit buildable but
I don't think you're gonna get above
medium with this but I just really like
it and I feel like my skin likes it too
so the next product is a new one from
Maybelline it's their curva tude liner
you have to it's got this kind of shape
so it kind of bends up and this is the
tip so you unscrew it it's not like a
push on push off you unscrew it and it
has this really weird shape where it
does come to a point and it's definitely
like a sponge tip but it has these weird
like extra lines that I feel like are
unnecessary regardless I used this today
this is a math product I think the idea
of this is great and it really in the
weirdest way the shape of this does make
it easier to do like a wing so that's
what I use today to create kinda I
always do like a little mini weighing
really and this was so easy to use it is
very easy to use however every time I've
used this I felt like it's just not
black enough it's like I don't know like
I feel like I'm using a crayola marker
if that makes sense it that's just how I
feel so I end up having to make sure
that I go over at a bunch of times and
even then it's not black enough so then
the next time I use it I use like gel
liner underneath then this on top
whereas the best liquid liners I've used
you could use alone and they're super
black so the shape is cool it actually
is effective I do think it's helpful
however I think the formula needs to be
improved but otherwise I mean I like it
so it's like just make the formula
better please so those were all of my
recent finds at both the drugstore and
high-end just some new products I've
been playing with and testing and I
wanted to share my thoughts on them
before they've been out for too long so
you can keep your eyes peeled for them
if they're good products I think the
most standout product out of all of
these that I was really the most
impressed by has to be these infallible
paint shadows or yeah infallible paint
metallic shadows I think they're so so
wonderful and you should definitely run
out and at least buy one shade I don't
think you need all of them my favorite
is this rose chrome one but they're all
so pretty it's hard to pick so I hope
that you enjoyed if you did please give
it a thumbs up I hope you'll subscribe
as well and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
