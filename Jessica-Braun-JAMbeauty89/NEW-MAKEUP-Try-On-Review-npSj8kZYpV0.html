review and try out in front of you on
camera the new bareMinerals bear pearl
line so I've got a foundation a primer
and a contour thing so I'm gonna talk to
you guys about the pros and cons the
price point if I think it's worth it if
I know of any drugstore kind of dupes
things like that so if you like this
kind of video I hope that you'll
subscribe I do this all the time I do a
lot of drugstore videos as well so I
hope that you'll stick around and catch
more of my videos otherwise let's go and
get it to it whoa there are a lot of
claims for this first product I'm going
to review and as I've tried it out I
have some thoughts so this is the bare
minerals bare Pro performance wear
liquid foundation with SPF 20 it retails
for $34 at Sephora they have 30 shades
on sephora's website and right now there
are eight reviews so it's 5 stars so the
packaging it has a pump
I really appreciate it's a good pump
it's the packaging is great I mean it's
simple but it's nice it's easy to use
it's easy to control how much comes out
now it says that this is like an up to
24 hour where kind of a foundation it's
got full coverage they say and it's and
yet it's breathable and it's good for
your skin and it's true to the color so
as I apply it today and I'll show you me
applying it right now it's very runny
and I tried this with a Beauty Blender
and it I didn't like it so today I tried
it with a brush now they actually I
actually have the brush that they
recommend using it with their luxe
performance brush but I didn't really
love it with that either and so today I
tried it with my artiste brush I thought
you know what if any brush is gonna do a
good job it's this one I love this brush
and of course it's really pricey but it
really is good it still just applies
weird it I don't know like it's so runny
and that's what makes it lightweight but
I just felt like as I kept rubbing it in
it just goes back and forth which is
exactly how I felt with their brush and
with a Beauty Blender and I I guess I
guess my biggest gripe is I don't enjoy
applying it now with that being said
once it actually
that's on your face it really does set
on its own now if you have super oily
skin
you're probably something they need to
set it but for me I'm kind of at that
normal stage right now in my skin and I
did notice like I felt like it kind of
set on its own and I did end up putting
powder on because I'm also reviewing
some powders but I just felt like it did
look good once I left it alone it was
just the application part that really
really bothered me so I'm wearing it
today and like if I look at myself up
close I don't feel like it looks cakey
at all this color that I applied which
is satine 0-5 I probably could have gone
a shade maybe darker but it went not
when I was first applying it I thought
it looked a little light but it actually
looks pretty good of course I've got
bronzer on and stuff like that too but
and I'll show you the bronzer here in a
minute but I do feel like it's set
pretty well it stays in place pretty
well I've worn it those other times and
I didn't notice it breaking apart too
much I did notice a little bit on my
nose but I noticed that with like every
foundation ever um but I think it looks
nice it gives an even coverage i I do I
will say this like I can still see
through my skin not see through my skin
you guys know what I mean so like I
ended up putting on two layers today and
I still could see little bits of like
redness like on my chin and like where
my freckles are and for that reason I
don't think it's fair that they claim
it's full coverage because I think at
best it's medium coverage and so that's
kind of my two cents on that do I think
it's a decent foundation yes do I think
it's my favorite no well I still wear it
of course because it does give a nice
look in the end another claim they have
is that it's still photo friendly even
though it has the SPF 20 so I'm
intrigued by that but I still really
liked it has one full ounce it didn't
have a noticeable smell that bothered me
and I think with 30 shades let me see
how deep they go it doesn't look like
they go super deep I mean like it goes
it definitely goes into the deep
territory but there are certainly a lot
more light
'i'm tones and there are the deep tones
so i'm wondering if some that have
really deep skin tones still won't be
able to find a match for them i don't
know if you have I guess the only person
I would recommend this for would be like
if you have a gift card and you're
looking for I always say that because
like with certain things I'm like unless
it's like my Holy Grail
I can't put my like stamp of approval
and say you've got to run out and go
spend your hard-earned money on it I
just can't but like if you had a gift
card and you like that kind of more of a
lightweight foundation that's kind of
runny but it it stays in place pretty
well because it is so thin of a formula
it doesn't feel or look cakey then you
might like it
but if you know you get annoyed when you
try a foundation that's so runny and you
feel like you're just going back and
forth and it's not actually blending
into your skin this you won't like but
hopefully that made sense okay now the
primer I put on underneath it is there
combo control milky face primer balance
now this is $28 at Sephora and it is one
ounce as well it's got like kind of a
thinner I don't know like little spout
and it's definitely milky it's kind of
whitish but definitely milky you can see
me applying it now it's very comfortable
this is meant for combo skin but you
know when you think combo using dry and
oily and I do think this is actually
really good
I I always go for hydrating primers that
is just the way I am I'm so used to
having dry skin now that my skin's a
little bit more normal
I'm still always reaching for hydrating
primers but this might be the perfect
answer because you know it is summer and
I do get a little bit oily here but I
also tend to have dry skin this is
beautiful because it felt hydrating that
also totally smoothes out my skin and so
and it kind of has that silicone like
feel but it's just a little bit
different it does feel a little bit more
hydrating I thought it was really really
nice so I have to admit I was a little
skeptical trying it but as I put it on
and I've worn it with other foundations
I mean like I said you know how I felt
about applying this on top but when I
was like try it with other foundations
and even with BB creams it just say
such a good first layer on my skin mine
being normal
sometimes dry and a little oily but just
because it's summer this was really
really nice so if you're in the market
for a new primer this is what I really
would recommend because it just blew me
away it really does everything you want
in a primer altogether now the only way
could be better is if it also had SPF
just saying anyway
but of course a lot of foundations have
it but for me I'm always just putting on
the SPF first then putting on a primer
because most primers don't have it ok so
I also just realized I figure it's worth
mentioning that I forgot that I have the
bare minerals bare Pro powder
foundations I've had these for a while
and this is actually a little it's not
totally dark for me it's the light
natural onine and all just dust this on
my face when I feel like I need a little
bit more coverage and I do like it
it's got good coverage I mean powder
foundation this is one of those things
that's great to throw over like a BB
cream or something like that maybe a
tinted moisturizer that has less
coverage and maybe you've been wearing
that all day and you're like ok I'm
about to go out and I want to look a
little more put together instead of
reapplying something I'll usually grab
this and just dust it all over and my
face instantly looks a lot more
perfected it soaks up any extra oil but
not so much that you just look like a
cakey mess so I do I like this now
drugstore wise I do think that there are
some that are pretty darn close I really
like the NYX no filter powder it's still
kind of a powder foundation it's got
good coverage and it's really easy to
throw on your face I mean it really is a
very similar look so if you were looking
at this honestly I would go for the next
one just to save yourself some money
unless you have a gift card as I always
say but this is really nice both of them
are ok last bareMinerals Mac it's a bare
minerals bare Pro product I wanted to
talk about is this contour palette now
everyone has contour palettes I'm tired
of hearing about contour palettes aren't
you guys aren't you guys I am but this
one was a little different to me because
it
this shade right here now most contour
kits have a grayish ish contour a bronzy
color and then a lighter color to maybe
highlight with I use all three of these
today so the first thing I did is I
applied the number one the shade and I
just applied it kind of on the back part
of my cheekbone and that's it and then
it was a little heavy cuz it's
definitely pigmented and I'm
fair-skinned so I just grabbed my
foundation brush I use and kind of
blended it a little bit then my favorite
shade the reason I would tell you to run
out and buy this this is like this
almost camel colored bronzer and it's
super pigmented so you do you know be
careful but if you use a really fluffy
brush and I just kind of bronze with it
just in those areas on the top of my
forehead my temples and then I kind of
went over that contour area cuz the idea
is they call this one blend because you
can also kind of blend it all together
with this but for me it's a perfect
bronzer and I just felt like the shade
was something so different than what
I've tried with a lot of other bronzers
I really really liked it I want that on
its own wonder if they sell it I want
that on its own they're so good and then
I use this pop just I mean obviously I'm
wearing a highlighter today if you're
curious I also filmed a pretty vulgar
review and I'm wearing a lot of pretty
vulgar products this is their highlight
and shimmering Swan I can link below the
highlights beautiful but this that's not
the idea of this this is like a supposed
to be at least if your my skin tone it
can totally be a highlight but one
that's not a shimmery one that's
actually making the light hit it a
certain way anyway it's supposed to just
lighten the area and this one in pop its
really nice I just put it on my
cheekbones I put it kind of in the
middle of my forehead and down my nose
just those areas I wanted to brighten a
little bit you could totally use this on
your under eye to kind of set your
concealer and brighten that area today I
used a different one but this is really
nice I have to admit it's the first
contour palette in a while that I felt
excited about because of the specific
shades in it and how I actually felt
like I could use all three of the shades
and not where I'm just picking and
choosing that I'm wearing
one or two of the shape I actually like
all of the shades in this palette and I
do feel like the staying power is very
very nice
I feel like generally bronzers stay on
pretty well on my skin I think if you
have oily skin that's a little trickier
but I was very impressed so those are my
two cents on the bareMinerals bear Pro
line at least what I have of it I will
link everything I mentioned below if
you're curious as well as if I mentioned
any drugstore other kinds of dupes I
will link those below as well I know you
guys are always trying to save money so
my so I hope this was helpful if it was
I hope you'll give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to catch more of my reviews
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
