be reviewing the Maybelline lip gloss
palette this is 1199 at drugstores I
know it sold on ulties website but I
also I found that at a store near me
called Meyer so if you have one near you
you might find it there and then endcap
it's kind of popping up in a lot of
places so definitely keep your eyes
peeled but if you can't find it in a
store near you definitely look online I
can play some links below for a few
different places I know that sell it
online but let's go ahead and get into
the review in the swatches of this
palette so let's get into the lip
swatches of these on my lips and then
I'll get into kind of my full review of
whether I think it's worth buying or not
so the first thing let's talk about the
packaging it's beautiful I mean it's
simple it's black it's really sleek um
in the drugstore no one has come out
with a palette like this that I know of
at least not in my lifetime of wearing
makeup and the range of colors is really
good I'll show you here in these
swatches that I mean it really does go
from a very light color to a very nice
deep color no it doesn't go to like a
black but most people don't wear that so
I don't think it's gonna be too missed
but I think they cover a lot of
different shades and tones in this
palette that I mean you can't really
miss when it comes to shades but let us
talk about pigmentation as you could see
a lot of them have a lot of pigmentation
but if you have pigments it looks like I
do like the lightest two shades really
don't show up these two honestly just
look like gloss on my lips but the first
one that does show up is this one and
I'm wearing on my lips because I wanted
you to see kind of what it looks like it
really does have that tone and so
everything from here down for me works
really well you do have to there's a
little brush that comes with it I have
had to dig to get it out and get it on
my lips I did my close-ups of this
palette before I did my lip swatches and
here's something I realized that's
interesting you can see pan on almost
all of these after one use and when I
say one use I mean I took my little lip
brush that came with it
I scratched out and to get
my lips to show color so you guys could
see the color of the lip gloss and hmm
one two three four five of them
completely chopin's so that sounds like
Chopin like the classical composer
uh-huh it makes me really sad because
that means that really the pans of these
are really really shallow so you're not
gonna get a ton of product so that is
one downside the peach one surprised me
right here which is the fifth one in
because I don't usually love peach
lipsticks on me or lip glosses for that
matter but I really liked this one the
one that was the most disappointed in
was the darkest shade you guys know if
you've been watching my channel for a
while that I like berry shades or even
that like mulberry deeper but this one
it was very patchy it wasn't the way you
know if you're wearing a darker more
vampy shade like that you want it to
look crisp because I did like emphasize
that because if it doesn't look crisp it
doesn't end up having the right effect
it ends up looking muddy it looks kind
of messy and like you don't really know
what you're doing and it just looks
sloppy so for me this one looked very
sloppy in my opinion so that was one of
the shades I was disappointed in but I
was impressed by quite a few of them
they packed more of a color punch than I
would have guessed especially again on
pigmented lips is this worth buying I
think it's only worth buying I mean this
1199 $12 which is higher for drugstore
but it's not completely crazy because
there are some drugstore products
they're like $15 which that is crazy but
it's a little pricier for drugstore I
think the only way this would be worth
it is if you maybe don't have a big
collection you were wanting to expand
your color selection in your collection
that was a lot of shown there other than
that if you you know if you're like me
and you have a decent amount of things
to choose between I don't think this is
a must-have you guys I know it looks
really trendy and cute and you know to
be honest I bought it because I saw a
picture of it and I was like oh my gosh
that's so cool
and it's different and it's cute so I
got it and of course I can review it for
you guys but if the only reason you're
buying it is because it's cute or its
new or it's trendy don't because it's
nice
it's not the best thing out there not
even close and I don't know I just I
feel like there's a lot better products
out there that you could buy I can link
if you're curious about what I'm talking
about my drugstore review playlist below
so you can see other drugstore lip
products that I love you and more than
this because I could go on for a day
about the different drugstore lip
products that I love so I will link that
below one I mean it's in front of me cuz
I just filmed the haul but I just did a
new at the drugstore haul and these are
brand new as well these are from Revlon
they're their ultra HD matte lip colors
and I really really like them I have a
deeper berry shade in addiction and then
I also have a more peachy pink shade in
devotion and these are beautiful they
dry to an almost matte finish I would
say satin but they are comfortable and
they say all day and they can give you
that crisp line you want because it
dries where it is whereas these they're
more like glosses so the deeper shades
they never really dry they just kind of
run but overall I think it's an okay
product hopefully my review made sense
to you I don't know what I feel
wishy-washy about a product I feel bad
because I feel like my review is not
clear because I don't feel like oh it's
terrible or oh what's amazing I'm just
right in between with this it's okay so
hopefully like I said it made sense and
