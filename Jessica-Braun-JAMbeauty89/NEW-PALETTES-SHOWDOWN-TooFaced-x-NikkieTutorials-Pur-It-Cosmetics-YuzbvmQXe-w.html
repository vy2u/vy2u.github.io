something a little bit different on my
channel I'll be featuring three brand
new pallets that were just sent to me
from different companies and swatching
them kind of looking at them closely
with you and deciding if it's worth
going out and spending your hard-earned
money on or not because almost I think
all of these are at least 40 dollars or
more this one the to face this new one
with nikkietutorials
is 56 dollars but it does have some more
stuff in it so we're gonna look at the
quality of the shadows inside and some
of them have other products inside as
well and see which one is worth it
let's go ahead and get into it so we'll
start with this much height to face the
power of makeup by nikkietutorials this
is coming out on August 15th and it's
$56 now when I opened it I was so
excited because she her eye looks are
just like crazy in the best of ways it
was still excited because I had to
figure that her quality would be
incredible and that she wouldn't approve
anything other than incredible so it's
the first thing in here and there's some
other stuff as well is this really thin
palette I love how thin it is I think
the packaging is awesomely glamorous so
when you open it there's like the little
thing it's bright pink here and it says
the power of makeup show us your looks
hashtag Nicki for Too Faced so in here
you've got nine shadows you have two
blushes one bronzer and then champagne
truffle which I presume she uses as a
highlight so it's a highlight it's in
one of their chocolate bar palettes as
an eyeshadow but I mean you could
totally use it as a highlight and of
course she always has like that bobono
highlight so it makes sense that she
would love that kind of thing so let's
start with the shadows here are the
swatches on my arm in order it is Ivy
and then sugar coat it is like that
light pink then there's frosted Young
which is sobering then irresistible
which is this nice gold and then one of
my favorites this medium cooler Brown
called painkiller then there's this warm
deep brown called make up and chill and
then there's this kind of deep teal
called mystic hour then this bright
purple called wham-bam and then this
perfect deep black map called wanted so
looking at the colors the only one I was
kind of unimpressed with was this white
called ivy it just I mean that's like
eight swatches just over and over and
over again now with the brush you can
get a little bit more pigmentation but
for me if I'm using a matte white I
probably want it to really be a matte
white like if I'm going under my brow
bone things like that but the rest of
them were wonderful this teal one called
mystic hour kicked up a lot of powder
but I mean as long as you're tapping
your brush off to get rid of the excess
you're gonna be fine the purple one is
kind of interesting it took a couple
swatches so it wasn't as buttery as the
rest but it's such a cool color and it's
kind of got this like different shift to
it that I was like whatever it's so cool
my personal favorites I really like the
matte ones that are in here this medium
brown one called painkiller painkiller
painkiller I told you is my favorite
mostly because of the shade because
that's when I use all the time to blend
colors together but again it took a lot
of PIP swatches for it
these are where this palette shines this
gold one called irresistible the silver
one called frosted YUM and the light
light pink one called sugar coated these
are incredible that was one swipe I mean
they are ridiculous
so I mean honestly I think they should
just come out of the trio with those
three suckers because that is what makes
this palette shine now let's look at the
blushes so they have a peach one and a
pink one in here this peach one is
called I will always love you and the
pink one is justify my love and I'm
pretty sure these are ones they already
have in their range but she just wanted
to include in here have the peach ones
really really pigmented so with no
exception here they are swatch they're
just gorgeous the ridiculously pigmented
personally with my skin tone I like the
peach one the best but they're both
gorgeous especially if you have a deeper
skin tone I really think the pink
justify my loved one would look amazing
these usually have pretty long wear
times if they're blushes I think are
really really nice so very impressive
both of those now the bronzer that's in
here is their classic chocolate Soleil
bronzer one of my favorites it's just a
gorgeous never really swatch as well but
it always looks good on the skin because
of course you would be putting it on
with the brush but
there it is there I do like it with my
skin tone if you've got deeper skin
though that's gonna do nothing well I
guess it could maybe be a powder for you
but it wouldn't do too much but it's a
good tone for my skin tone and then
champagne truffle like I mentioned oh my
gosh is crazy glittery this seems like a
toned down version so maybe they did
make it more of like a highlight so I
just grabbed my Too Faced chocolate bar
palette the champagne truffle in here is
right there and I want to compare it
yeah so the one in the actual shadow is
much more pigmented this right here is
champagne truffle from the actual
eyeshadow palette the chocolate bar
palette this is champagne truffle in her
palette as a highlight so I do think
they might have toned down the formula
since it would be used as a highlight
which really makes sense to me so I
think that was probably a good change on
their part however the champagne truffle
and the chocolate bar palette is amazing
now that's pretty awesome in itself but
for 56 dollars that's a lot of money
however if you think about like the
Urban Decay Naked palette those are like
now what $52 so you're spending $4 more
and you're getting some blush and some
bronzer and some highlight but there's
more so in the box that you get when you
order it it comes with this little bag
inside and inside the bag you open some
more products now Too Faced is one of my
favorite makeup brands so this is their
two faced shadow insurance since their
deluxe size and it's an eyeshadow primer
this stuff is amazing I have repurchased
this quite a few times
they're great drugstore dupes as well
like the Milani eyeshadow primer is
fantastic it's exactly like this but it
is really good so for it to come with
this and even though this is just a
deluxe size these lasts a pretty darn
long time because you only need a very
little bit so that is an awesome
addition to go with these shadows not
only that but you get a full-size of the
new Too Faced sketch marker and this
one's just in black and these are their
liquid black liners they actually just
sent me all of their liners and this and
they have some amazing colors but of
course black is what most of us use each
day very very pigmented so in the fact
that it's full-size again that's amazing
and there's more
you also get a trial size of the Too
Faced better than sex mascara which is
really really nice if you like just
light flirty lashes I think it adds a
decent amount of volume but it's not
like the best mascara I've ever used but
it's still pretty good and then there's
one more thing in here and it's there
two-faced
glamour dust and it's in glitter Li
that's funny so let's I haven't opened
this yet oh my so there's nothing
stopping it so it's literally glitter oh
my gosh I mean do you guys see that
that's just like one little swipe tons
of glitter so with all of this together
I mean you've got an eyeshadow primer
you've got the eyeshadow blush bronzer
highlight mascara liner and some glitter
you're pretty much good is there
anything missing oh just like face stuff
like foundation concealer but I mean
there's so much you can do with this so
I thought wow that's a lot for $56
compared to some other things you buy
for like $50 and you don't get all this
extra stuff so in my opinion if you're
really in the market to buy a new
palette or you want something that
really gives you a lot of options this
is an awesome fine because it does have
so much and it's not just the palette
but it also has all those extras and of
course the nikkietutorials one comes
with a little glamour guide or it's got
pictures of her so cute and just
different look she's created step by
step which i think is really cool if
you're really wanting some inspiration
for some really different looks that one
is so gorgeous it'd be perfect for just
like parties or even like New Year's Eve
things like that Christmas so I love
that you know what the stuff you have
and once you have this you can genuinely
do any of these looks so I think that's
cool now I know this is gonna be sold on
two-face website of course but it's also
at Sephora and Ulta and tons of other
places so I will link this below if
you're interested it doesn't come out
until the 15th so depending on when
you're watching this video so the next
one is $42 and it's from pure and it's
their love your selfie to now they did
come out with an original love your
selfie palette which I've not tried but
this is the second one this one I think
the packaging is really cute it's got
that white with the shimmery silver
glitter all over it which is just really
pretty and on the back it has a listing
of all the names of all
shape so I'm gonna try and like read
that oh what's on there too sweet it's
also on the front so it has a little
thing on it says embrace your beauty
inside and out so in the palette you'll
see there are eight eyeshadows and then
there it looks like there's kind of two
highlighters and a bronzer it also comes
with the lip gloss a lip liner and then
a yes is my favorite mascara okay it
also comes with a mascara and this is
their fully charged mascara well then I
have the full size so let's we might as
well just start with the mascara this is
the pure fully charged one now it comes
with the smaller one it doesn't come at
the full size however so many studies
have said that there's not much of a
difference in the amount of time you use
these about the same before they're kind
of dried out so it doesn't really matter
but this one I can show you the brush so
the brush is just kind of a simple
regular mascara brush but there's
something about it it says it's powered
by magnetic technology I don't know what
that means but I cannot stop using it
today I had to force myself to use
another mascara just to try some other
stuff out but I loved this so much so
that is an awesome addition I hadn't
realized that was it so that alone is
awesome so the next thing we might as
well do the lip products while we're at
it as well this is their Velvet Matte
lip pencils so it's not necessarily a
lip liner and it's in the shade focal
point and let's just see oh it's really
really creamy so there it is right there
a really nice berry color I feel like
this would be absolutely perfect in the
fall I just got excited looking at it
it's so pretty and it's just so creamy
so that is pretty awesome as nice and
small you can fit it in your purse yeah
yeah and then the lip gloss is their lip
gloss in the shade silhouette and it
just looks like it's a really nice
simple color that you could probably
wear oh it's a little bit warmer it's so
pretty though just a doe foot applicator
it's got some nice color some nice Sheen
I'm still tired of all the matte lips so
I'm excited to be branching out some
more I think all of us are tired of it
but this is just a nice pretty color and
add some life to your lips but it's not
too light but it's not too dark and
neither one really have any smell so now
let's get to what we're all here for the
eyeshadows so here are some swatches so
in order the first shade which is kind
of a stark white
is called headshot the next one that's a
little bit harder to see is called
statuesque and it's just a nice matte
very light brown the next one is called
panorama and the next to that there's
kind of panorama is kind of a more warm
toned nice shimmery Brown and then the
next one abstract is a more cool toned
shimmery Brown and then the next one
it's kind of a light pink is called pose
the nice burgundy shade is sketch the
deeper golden is called megapixel and
then the very last one it's kind of a
nice deep green is called paparazzi so
all of these were very buttery very
impressed with these two shades here
which was panorama and abstract they're
just so buttery and those are my
favorite kind of deeper shimmery shades
just put on my lid kind of blend into
the crease and go there kind of like
those one shadow kind of looks that I'm
falling in love with but again it's a
nice mix of colors where they do have
some lighter ones I wish they have maybe
one more matte medium brown however the
bronzer in this which we'll look at in a
second you could probably use for that
anyway but and I really like that they
incorporated like this kind of more red
toned one too just to switch it up the
only one that I felt like wasn't showing
up as well as I'd wanted was again just
like in the other palette that kind of
lighter brown which is called statuesque
again that could be more you know just
looking at my skintone it blends in
really well to that but even still
there's just not as much pigment to it
as the other so now moving on to the
highlight shades so in order the first
one is called overexposed and it's a
very white tone highlight the middle one
which so gorgeous is called photogenic
and then the bronzer color is called
composition these were insanely buttery
all three so like this bronzer compared
to the chocolate Soleil this one
swatches really well it's a nice kind of
warm brown so it is definitely more of a
bronzer shade versus like a contour
shade the middle one the peach one
photogenic honestly for me I could
probably use as a blush for others it
would be more of a highlight and then
the really white one is kind of a little
bit more of a like matte radiance type
of thing work
but like a satin where it's not super
shimmery but it would highlight the
areas you want so it'd be really good at
facial highlighting as well so those I'm
very impressed with the formula so for
this palette for forty-two bucks that's
a lot again comparing 42 to 56 of course
the other one came with like an eye
primer and stuff but this one comes with
lip stuff so it just depends on maybe
what you're looking for and maybe that
14 dollar difference really is gonna
make a break you see you'd rather do
something like this I'm giggling about
all these kind of all-in-one pouts it
makes me think of like do you member
when Mary Kay and maybe they still do
I'm sure some of you guys will know like
the all-in-one palettes you can put your
blush in and some eyeshadows and then
there'd be like a little area for like
your lipstick or your lip gloss on the
side that shuts down over it this is
what it makes me think of but I don't
mind it so much but I really really was
impressed with the eyeshadow colors on
this one and the love yourself e palette
also comes with recommended like looks
you can do which I think is always
pretty helpful so the last palette we're
gonna talk about today is the it
cosmetics superhero palette if you
follow me on snapchat you saw me
watching these on there when I first got
this and kind of the eye look I did with
it then it's supposed to be an
anti-aging power they said they
developed the formula for these shadows
with plastic surgeons where they've got
you know collagen and all these
different ingredients they have to
separate into different sections so
there's the superhero nudes down here
these three in the middle at the bottom
it's the superhero neutrals then there's
the superhero liners which you can use
wet or dry and then the top part are
there I found a ssin so those are
supposed to be so creamy and developed
so perfectly that they can be primers
they can be they neutralize your the
skin on your eye so they're perfect for
bases without using a separate eye
primer which i think is actually really
cool of course you can use these in any
way you want which is what I did but I
think it's kind of neat that they did
that so let's talk about some of the
colors and the swatches so going in
order the first three are those eye
foundations and that is confidence which
is like the matte white one and the one
next to it that's like kind of more of a
yellow tone of the same thing is called
POW and the third one in which is really
pretty shimmery peach is called magical
then
the next three are the superhero news so
the first one is limitless and then
powerful is kind of the peachy shade and
then aura is the nice bronzy color and
then the next one the next three are the
superhero neutrals and the gold one is
called unstoppable then there is super
star which is like kind of a purplish
tone and then the more burnt sienna tone
is called fearless and then the last
three are the superhero liners and so
the blue one is called bold the brown
one is called daring and the black one
is called superhero black liner is my
super hero this might be the most
perfect palette when it comes to what
you might need and on top of that every
shade was one swipe and just looking at
it I mean it's ridiculous how well
formulated every single shadow and this
palette is and you know all three of
these were sent to me I have you know
kind of ifs ands or buts about all of
them with certain little things but this
one I really don't have much to say I
mean the worst thing is the shape
because I try and put it in my drawer
this way and it doesn't fit like that's
my biggest complaint it's just it's
sleek it's small it has a nice mirror if
you need it but on top of that all the
shades are so amazing and again it's
such a range of colors it's got enough
mattes enough darker colors for liner I
mean you can do anything with this it
really it's like a superhero palette
this one is $42 as I'd said supposedly
it's good for anti-aging I know that it
lasts all day without a primer because
I've worn it a couple times with no
primer and it has not budged even like
on my lower lash line I put some of the
darker liner colors I think I use the
brown one thank you though for 42 bucks
if you maybe don't have any palettes and
you're ready to like buy a really nice
one this one is amazing they are all
amazing I can't say I mean all of them
are but this is kind of the one that
across the board
impressed me so much none of them are
huge duds all of them are very good
palettes I was very impressed there are
plenty of palettes I've tried that like
across the board I just did not like
whether it was the colors whether it was
the formula or maybe tons of them were
pigmented maybe it didn't blend well but
all three of these are total hits
they're absolutely awesome I just found
myself really drawn towards this one now
the reality is I love all of them I'm
gonna end up using them a lot but that's
just my two cents
let me know if there are other new
pallets that you're trying out that you
think I should try or maybe just that
you're loving that you want to tell
everyone about let us all know below
because I know we all like reading about
different experiences or maybe you've
tried some of these pallets and you
didn't have a very pleasant experience
let us know below because I know you
know skin types if you've got oily lids
it totally plays a part in how well a
pallet will work for you so let us know
below your experiences with these other
than that I hope this was helpful I'll
have links and info on pricing and stuff
for all three of these down below if you
are interested I hope that you'll
subscribe to catch more of my reviews
