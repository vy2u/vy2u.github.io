show okay why didn't I call my channel
the J show there's probably like already
a J show okay I crazy if you I don't
know what water I'm uploading videos but
I'm doing just like a ton of filming
today because well just like I'm gonna
have to fill them a couple in a day so
just bear with me for a while I'm
getting my feet wet with teaching
because things are crazy things are so
pretty okay your your teacher you've
ever Walt heck if you've ever started a
new job you don't crazy things are it's
like nerve-wracking and exciting and
like you're like I don't think I know
what I'm doing pretty sure I'm
completely clueless like no um so I'm
doing a lot of filming something like
feeling crazy and just having one of
those cuckoo for cocoa puffs days okay I
have a new box for you guys and they
contacted me and I was like I'm alone I
took awhile to respond I'm like terrible
businesses that contacted me are
probably like she's the worst but I will
not respond for like ever cuz I want to
think about things like I don't want to
say yeah for sure I'll review your thing
now of course I told you this before I
never say yeah I don't give it a good
review
no I'll spec if you want to send it to
me by all means go for it but no
guarantees on how I'm gonna feel about
it and if I review it or not so this one
then contacted me and it was like food
and I was like maybe never done it why
not right why not but it was an
expensive box it's like $45 a month of
course they were sending it to me to
review so I didn't have to pay it but
I'm thinking what benefit is this gonna
do you guys if it's $45 a month I mean I
wouldn't pay I'm gonna be real I
wouldn't pay it because I don't have
that kind of money to spend no I had all
kinds of money oh sure sure if I could
just throw money around like on tons of
different subscription boxes of course I
would but this is one of my jobs so I
figure you know what I'll just do it who
knows a few you out there might really
be interested in it or really be a
foodie or like a chef or a cook I mean I
my boyfriend and I love to cook and we
love ironically the reason this
initially drew my attention in the end
and the reason I was like okay I'll do
it
I've been prepping this for two minutes
I'm sorry just whatever just listen just
listen the reason I thought it was
pretty cool is because this box is a
Food Box that features different
countries cuisines each
you get the box and we always cook meals
like when we're really feeling it and
there was like a couple weeks a few
weeks ago that like every night we were
cooking a different cuisine we would did
Moroccan and then we did once have we
done in the end German Italian of course
I mean there were a few did we do well
of course you did makes it Mexican we
did Spanish we did I don't know we did
quite a few and we have a list of ones
we're gonna try I think we did Israeli I
don't know regardless that's something
we like to do we like to go up like our
favorite app is Jung Lee oh my gosh if
you haven't used it up it's such a good
recipe app but anyway um and we just
will look up different recipes from that
cuisine and then make them and it's just
so much fun we'll even do like wine or
drinks from there like that we could
make that is something more traditional
there so that's what we do so this box
and like dude I told Tyler guy he's like
yea say yes I'm like well I'm gonna
think about it anyway
it's called try the world oh boy it's a
big ol box really I mean compared it's
kind of heavy
this month's was France which I thought
was wonderful because we I don't think
we have no I know we have not made a
French meal yet so I'm really excited to
see what's in here and see if we can use
it for some recipes that I've looked up
before just to see if it will kind of
fit right in but I'm very excited so oh
a few things so it's $45 a month well
let me rephrase its $45 but it's every
two months you get it so I guess if you
split it up well as if it were a monthly
subscription to be what like twenty to
fifty a month that math right yeah well
I just looked in it looks really cool
okay it looks pensive okay so first I
give you a culture guide which I'm
assuming it's his greetings and welcome
to your sojourn in Paris it gives you oh
my gosh okay so first this is parisian
playlists and gives you a bunch of songs
like i'm him the him alum or by Edith
Piaf heat okay um I mean just the time
and then what's the next French movies
it gives you a list of French what this
is adorable French poetry
oh and then it gives you that poem in
French of course because things get lost
in translation that is for sure
it says explore Paris culture and it
goes through like the Louvre and all
kinds of other things I don't know how
to pronounce yet I say yeah cuz I
figured eventually I will some Paris
tips when you're going around Paris how
to make clips that's cool it's got the
recipe for them and this is hungry for
more French culture and then it says
check out our magazine online like an
online magazine this is really cool it
says if you keep traveling discover
Tokyo so I wonder if that's the next box
coming ok so what I'm getting excited
I'm getting excited to cook all this
stuff or use it at least so it tell it
has a thing that explains exactly what
everything is let's dig in ok first
thing I'm seeing is this nougat like
little bars that says Chabert and giel
I'm I'm sure I'm gonna butcher all these
I'm sorry especially if you're from
France or used to be crunched I'm sorry
I try my best but it comes with two of
them let's see what this says on here
there it is founded in 1848 this brand
has been run by the Chabert family in
the city of montélimar southeastern
france it says that this nougat is so
well known throughout France I often
find yourself tucked into suitcases for
all sorts of tricks that's cute I wonder
if you're from France if you've heard of
this like if this actually is or if
they're saying that um but this would be
a nice like with coffee kind of thing I
pitched like with black coffee party go
straight right now cuz enjoy get the
black coffee but so that would just be a
nice like Sunday morning with your
newspaper just like Nugget nougat
alright the next thing I'm seeing ooh
now Sony a day Camargue my boyfriend
speaks in French I should have had him
like tell me how to pronounce all these
before I started this so this it says
that it's seesaw that's pretty cool
because we just bought some Himalayan
pink salt to use instead of just table
salt because it's got more of like the
from what I understand it's got more of
the nutrients and it's not as stripped
from all that naturally comes in it so I
love the idea of that and this I wonder
if it'd be you know similar but it says
it's flour of salt
an artisanal unrefined finishing salt
its cultivated in the South of France
the coastal area it's harvested by hand
traditionally sold in its purest form I
love that due to its relative scarcity
and it's labor intensive production
Florida cell is one of the most
exclusive finishing salts this is a lot
too so that's actually like useful and
cooking and you know you you saw all the
time and I feel so much better if I'm
using salt to use something that is more
unrefined that doesn't have all these
weird additives or things take it out of
it and then replace with chemical things
you know so that is awesome alone sheesh
alright is this the next thing is this
creme I don't know it's a chestnut
spread it looks like it's like okay I'm
just gonna say it it looks like you know
the buck paste like little jars like for
babies that's what it reminds me of like
row like Creek lead you know you know
what I mean all right let's see what it
says about this sorry that was a really
bad comparison but you know it's a
unique recipe by master confectioner
Clement fo GA you know why I butcher
that one 1885 it's got chestnuts and
vanilla whoo delicious pure it can be
used alone as a dessert or enjoyed with
cookies or from meal foya
baking or on yogurt on toast on brioche
on a coastal very excited about this and
interesting because I've never had
anything like this here in America
that's for sure
unless a point Nutella but I don't know
if it would be okay the next thing I'm
seeing are these all this is adorable
it says 1856 Klaus caramels so and the
sued initiatives you know get you know
salted butter caramel the recipe was
from 1946 they were celebrating the
return to leisure at the beach and Cuba
on Brittany so yeah huh it's a nostalgic
joie de brie de vivre I've never had
known how to say it doesn't matter
anyway
um very excited about this again like
this and then nougats would be great
like little dessert things without
having to worry about cooking a dessert
like if you are making a French meal
just like cutesy little things like this
I love I just
things like this don't you guys okay the
next thing I'm assuming these two go
together they look like jellies it's Jam
little ones this one is wild blueberry
in this one's Africa oh my gosh my dad
would go insane this would be a nice
breakfast like on toast or something
where is it okay Elaine Melia made with
fresh fruits in the finest fruit growers
in France it's a sensory experience
luscious perfectly right ripe fruit okay
yeah yeah yeah the wild blueberries come
from high-altitude shrubs in the
Bergeron apricots famous for his
acidulated flavors regardless I mean
come on those are adorable it really
would be perfect like for don't break
okay didn't Ricky oh my gosh
all right all right we're good awesome
awesome awesome I wish they were a
little bigger but you know what this is
speaking of big this is gigantic it's
not a bag don't let me get it out miss
it I hope it's what I think it is yeah I
think it is mustard okay it looks like a
de John type mustard let me see what it
says Clovis from France the origin of
mustard production in France dates back
to the Roman Empire they exported
mustard seeds in Gaul as early as the
10th century in 1856 John something
created the recipe of the famous this
stuff that's in French but Dijon mustard
whose strong taste state's unique today
okay I am a big fan of mustard just all
mustard but especially like de John type
mustards you know sweet brown mustard
all of that stuff this looks amazing
can you guys see like all the like
little seeds or whatever those are
I mean it's straight up full size that
you know what this would be really good
on it's just coming to me like chicken
as just you could almost probably use
this alone just on baked chicken and
just give it like that
juicy delicious taste without really
having to do much that is awesome
it looks like there is more oh my gosh
alright this is a joke a lot okay this
powder I think I think this is hot
chocolate powder yes only the finest
cocoa beans are used to create
is selected from renowned provenances
it's not provinces it's different
carefully roasted to bring out the
natural aroma of the tropics okay at all
it's a blend with bourbon vanilla for a
subtle smooth I love hot chocolate who
doesn't so that is gonna be awesome I
think it's just one it might be too
packed I think it's too yeah it's two
packets in there cool and then the last
thing in here yes is that it's got to be
tea it's got once you it's got one two
three four tea bags let's see what kind
it is though cuz it's in written and
French okay um la palette I did today do
teh iDEN it combines the allure of the
Orient with the panache of the French
tea culture enjoyed hot or cold they're
fragrant teas are for more than a
beverage their perfume in a cup a
journey for all the senses I like bad
idea so that's nice and you guys know I
love tea and like that cozy mug tea
subscription box that is awesome oh my
gosh I freaking love that thing um this
reminds me that so that is always nice
and I'm always down for trying new teas
and so it's Tyler so yeah I got the tea
the hot chocolate the cool thing of salt
the two shams the full thing of mustard
the buck pace no I'm kidding the
chestnuts forever I was a hazelnut the
two nougat things and then the caramel
and the little culture guy 45 bucks one
of those things you know if you have
that extra or if you know you like to
buy gourmet little food things like this
anyway and you know you might spend that
much like at a store anyway then do it
this way and then it's like exciting
surprises so I really like it but you
know you know I'm um fiscally minded but
we'll say so if I if I were paying for
this I don't know even if I had the
money of course I would but I don't
so I'm glad they sent it to me but
that's something you guys have to decide
you're yourself self of course but the
box is like heavy-duty like I'm probably
gonna reuse this box or something cuz
it's like and cute I will put the link
below for you guys and I hope you
enjoyed I know it was a different type
of video certainly not typically found
on my channel but hey I figured out a
chair but I will cut you guys very soon
