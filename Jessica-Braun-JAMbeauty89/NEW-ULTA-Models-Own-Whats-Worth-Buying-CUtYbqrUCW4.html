review of a bunch of products from
models owned now models owned has been a
brand elsewhere for a long time but it's
just now coming to the United States and
it's available and Ulta right now so I
recently got some things both from
models on PR but then also I bought some
models on products myself so I wanted to
talk about them I already have some
swatches on my army show you kind of
tell you what I liked from the brand so
far and what I didn't like I do think
that they are kind of bridging the gap
price-wise between drugstore and
higher-end for example like these
pallets are inching up on $20 I think
they were like $18 of course you can get
sales when I bought some of these they
were 40% off so at least in that respect
I could save actually a pretty good
amount of money but when it's not on
sale regular price you know that is kind
of pricey also is really good about
having sales so so let's start with the
thing I've been asked about the most
their eyeshadow palettes so this first
one I'm going to talk about is actually
one they sent me and it's their color
chrome eyeshadow palette and it has ten
different shades they're all cream shows
every single one of them and as you look
at the swatches here some of them are
really nice and some of them just kind
of wisp away into nothing for example
this shape platinum here this like white
shade is just like a silver glitter it
just doesn't do anything even if you pat
it on top of a shadow it almost just
wipes away the shadow underneath and it
doesn't actually do anything you can
wear these on their own but they just
don't pack much of a punch some of them
look really pretty in swatches but when
you actually put them on the lids I just
don't feel like they're really doing
anything and then they don't most
shadows stay pretty well on my eyes that
these don't really stay long and I don't
usually experience that with even with
any other cream eyeshadows so for no
reason I feel like you'd be better off
maybe staying away from this when the
packaging is awesome like I said some of
the swatches are not bad but when you
actually put them on your eye they look
okay but then they just start to fade
away after about an hour or two so I
just don't think it's worth even the
$17.99 or even the sale price this is
you know what around ten bucks I would
pass now the other shadow palette I got
is called barely there
and this one they had a bunch of these
different ones all of their color
combinations are great I was really
impressed as I looked through them and
was trying to decide which one to
purchase on my own I was like you know
there were I was between a lot of them
there was this other one called
Supernatural which I can put on the
screen right now that was really pretty
they almost bought but I ended up going
with barely there and again this has ten
shades it has one two three four five
shimmers and five mattes the color
combination you could totally do a
complete look with this now I think that
the maps are just better than the
shimmers with this and I feel like the
shimmer is again they just kind of wisp
away into nothing you can build it up a
little bit but once you start blending
they just kind of blend away the matte
ones blend really well I think they even
swatch well and again I could get an OK
look with this palette it's not like
it's unusable so if you've already
bought it you know and I'll probably try
to use it a couple more times but
honestly I feel like it just wasn't
worth the price if this were a five
dollar palette I probably say wow this
is actually pretty impressive but
because it's nearing that $20 mark I'm
like I mean honestly no I don't think
it's worth that again I like the white
packaging I think it's pretty nice
packaging it comes with a little dual
ended brush but honestly if you were
buying one of the to avoid the cream one
this is way better but I still don't
think it's worth the price now if you
have tried any of the other palettes and
you think it's really really good let me
know down below I know probably some of
you guys are curious so the next product
I bought that is amazing is the models
own sculpting glow highlight powder in
peach pearl this sucker has the most
beautiful iridescent purplish peach ish
kind of tone and it just looks amazing
on so many skin tones I love the
packaging it has this really cool swirl
design in the actual powder has a little
look I almost said Lance what has a
little mirror and I like that about the
color let me show you is they do for
another really expensive highlighter can
now don't tell anyone
look the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in prismatic amethyst comes in a really
pretty like lilac purple packaging so
looking at
the swatches there you can see that holy
moly those are so similar I think maybe
the prismatic amethyst has a little bit
more lilac to it but they look the same
on the skin it's so amazing so I mean if
you want to save money that comes to
that it's a really nice highlighter it
looks beautiful and then it's totally
nude for that the next product is this
model own faith based face primer so
they had a couple of different primers
this one of their illuminating one and
it says it's oil free fragrance free
silicone base um I like the packaging
and there's a two but then it has a pump
when you pull off the lid this when I
first squeeze it up I said oh it's
beautiful what kind of beige colored
primer well when you blend it in farther
all over your face it literally has
glitter in it now I'm actually wearing
this today I didn't get ready with me
with some of these products but I did it
for like it for an entire Ulta haul so
if that's up I will link it if it's not
stay tuned subscriber will be up soon so
you can see it in action there but it
literally has glitter so any foundation
you put on top of it ends up looking
kind of glittery and it's just not my
favorite like like I said it's on today
I entered having to set it and for the
powder foundation just to kind of tone
it down because it really is a lot so I
don't think this is one that is my
favorite if you really really like
glittery looks go for it but it's actual
glitter it's not shimmer its glitter so
you can't tell that in the package so
it's very North a misleading because
they say it's luening it's just kind of
surprising so I would say stay away I am
interested to try the other primers cuz
I liked the consistency of this the next
product is are sculpting glow
highlighter stick and this is in the
shade moonlight and it reminds me of a
lot of the highlighter sticks that are
popular right now like milk have some
but this one's a little bit smaller it
is this beautiful kind of I want to
thank beige a highlighter no glitter
just this gorgeous glow and I love when
products don't have glitter they just
have that glow and this is so stunning
this is one of those things that you
could literally just wipe it on wherever
you want and then take a sponge and
blend it in
and it looks gorgeous you could just put
it on your hand grab a sponge and then
tap it on you could use your finger you
could use a like stippling brush I
haven't tried any of the other shades
but I was very impressed it stays on all
day it's just so beautiful it looks very
high-end I feel like what I have it on
I'm like wow like that looks really nice
so this is totally what I recommend you
pick up it just gives you a very
youthful look do you know what I mean
very dewy but you can control where
you're putting it the last product is
the models own luck stick lipstick of
velvet and it's in whisper this is like
a pink this is not a color I would
necessarily wear all the time it's like
ever but the formula is really really
nice this is the lipstick that you're
going to have to reapply quite often but
I found that it wasn't super drying on
the skin it glide on really comfortably
it wasn't 100% opaque it just wasn't but
I didn't mind that again I'd rather I
need to get a different color this is
one they sent to me um I just think it's
kind of average I guess is what I'm
saying it is not a fabless it by any
means I think it's really nice but
unless you're like dying to try a
certain color or maybe have a coupon or
a sale I don't know if they've coupon
all told to keep them anyway unless
there's like a crazy sale or you see a
color who are dying to try I don't think
this is something you need to run out
and go buy I don't think it's bad I just
don't think it's any better than other
drugstore brands that maybe are priced a
little bit lower I think if the Revlon
Super Lustrous lipsticks are really nice
there's just so many other options out
there for less for cheaper that I don't
think you need to get but it still is
good so if you're like buying a bunch of
stuff I would say find a color you might
like you'll probably still like it but
the packaging is kind of cute it's all
chrome of course that shows like finger
prints a lot which you know that bothers
me that I'm like a clean freak about it
I guess so if you have any suggestions
of models own products that you know of
maybe you live in the UK where they've
been selling it for a while or just
somewhere else they've been selling it
and you know of products that are really
really good please let us know down
below so we can all kind of interact and
find some new products we can try I'd be
curious to try more because while there
were some products that were kind of
and for me there were others that I
actually really liked I'd be interested
to try more of their powder products
like their highlighters maybe bronzers
blushes since I was so so impressed with
the highlighter but I think overall the
shadow palettes are okay like I said the
primer I want to try just different
primers because I like the consistency
love the highlighting stick love the
powder highlighter the lipsticks okay
and I say stay away from the cream
shadow one but overall not terrible but
I am interested to try other ones that
you guys love too please let us all know
down below if you like these kinds of
videos definitely subscribe stay tuned
