going to share with you some brand new
items from wet and wild I went crazy
other day shopping for these and I'm
excited to show you guys some of what's
out there some of it is amazing some of
it just comes so so some of it maybe I
didn't like as much so I was going to
get into it so I'm going to try it
throughout I got ready using a lot of
these products today fine wearing a lot
of them so as I'm introducing them to
you I'll certainly tell you what I'm
wearing and some of them I even filmed
kind of just some quick demos of me
applying it so I'll show that as well so
first thing that I've heard so much
about I'm wearing on my lips are the new
liquid catsuit matte lipsticks so I have
five of the shade and today on my lips
I'm wearing the red one it's in 930 B
which is called Missy and fierce but
they also have this berry one that it's
really pretty these are it's a very thin
thin formula it reminds me of like the
Oprah ones that I love so much and
they're a little bit they're a little
bit more dry than the Oprah ones but
they are a lot cheaper so I'm all about
that so that is this berry one called
very recognized and then this kind of
fleshy pink one is called pink really
hard and it well actually it's more like
a honestly it's kind of like a bright
not coming across exactly the same it's
kind of a bright almost peachy color not
one that would be my favorite on my skin
tone but it'd look really pretty on
other people
this one is more Newton it's called give
me mocha this one is really pretty it's
a much deeper brown type shade it's
really pretty though I've liked this one
myself too and then this really light
one is called nudist peach and it's
certainly peach certainly peach it's not
too light though it kind of looks like
it might be really like this a little
bit deeper than what you usually see
which I kind of like so and then of
course the red one you see it on my lips
that's pretty much what it looks like
but these are nice they're a thinner
formula they're comfortable and I found
that yes I need to reapply them
throughout the day it wears like most
matte lipsticks do and
you know after a couple hours it's a
little bit dry you want to reapply by
the end of the day it certainly doesn't
look perfect especially if you've been
eating so I mean it really is a standard
one but I like it and they're so cheap
like I'm saying especially compared to
the offal ones I like those more just
because they're a little bit more
comfortable but these aren't nearly as
dry as like the Kat Von D ones like
these are awesome I got every shade I
could find these are the new wet and
wild gel lip liners I have six shades
and that might be all of them they
certainly all that they sold in the
store I bought them in these are so good
they really are gel like and that
they're really creamy very pigmented
very comfortable I'll show you a clip of
me applying the red one which I'm also
wearing today this one is called red the
scene and it's you know just a classic
red I also have a berry one which would
look really nice with that very cat suit
this one's called plum together and it's
just a really pretty plum color and I've
been wanting one of these I had one
that's like discontinued from another
brand so I'm excited to have another one
they have a lot of neutrals so this one
is called bear to comment so we're going
to see this one is a more peachy nude
this one is a little Pinker it's called
never petal down and I don't worn all of
these yeah but definitely more of a pink
a mid tone pink I would say this one is
a little bit deeper it's called dawn
burgundy and it's more of yeah kind of
it really is more of like a burgundy it
looks like the cap is lighter than the
actual color here but it's really pretty
but it is kind of a warm tone and then
this last one that I own is think
flamingos this one is a lot lighter and
brighter in real life it's not coming
across as bright on my on the viewfinder
but anyway and then the red which I
didn't swatch but I'll swatch that one
for you is right here on top so I really
like these
I said they're incredibly cheap really
nice quality good packaging its
retractable lip liners I love that the
color of the shade is the is the lid I
just I don't know why but I like that I
just like that so these are solid a plus
to me
oh this next one this is the wet and
wild photo focus foundation so a lot of
people love this it's so inexpensive
which is amazing the idea of this photo
focus line is that it should look
amazing in photography no flashback
anything like that so it's a trustworthy
product in that sense and I totally
agree the packaging is really
interesting because it has like a paddle
that has product on it so you take the
paddle and wipe it all over your face
so and so I'll show you a demo of me
applying it as I'm talking about it but
this shape that I have is in 3 6 5 C
soft beige it comes across is a little
bit darker than my skin tone but then as
I blend it in it kind of works and of
course I'm wearing it today so they
don't have a huge color range they never
usually do unfortunately
so that is when you draw back as it is
with so many lines of foundation at the
drugstore and anywhere for that matter
but anyway but there is no flashback it
does blend in I think it looks great on
camera and in photos in real life when I
look at it up close I mean you can
certainly tell I'm wearing something but
it's not as bad as like like I think of
the Urban Decay one that I recently
tried that by really high coverage or
any other one like that where it's meant
to be really high coverage but then it
makes my dry spot for crazy for me with
this
it doesn't really illuminate the dry
spots on my face and I think that's what
took me by surprise because most
foundations like this do but I think
because this is a thinner formula even
still I think that's why so I really
like it the challenge will be can you
find your shade or shade that could
possibly work that is going to be the
challenge for most people but I was
surprised at how much I liked is it my
favorite foundation in the world no but
is it one of the best at the drugstore
right now I would say yes and I would
say you know it would probably work for
whether you can gals
I've got dry
skin I think it works pretty well not a
natural finish but not like a horribly
cakey finish just so you know it is
night time and I'm drinking coffee it's
like 7:30 bad habits bad habits but I'm
like I'm going to be up for a while
filming and I'm just enjoying it but I
just kind of wanted that nice like
caffeine rush so is what it is anyone
else you're in coffee at night sometimes
I know it's about habit the next thing
is the photo focus so it's that same
line but it's the concealer I bought the
shade light ivory and I'll show you me
applying it uh I like this stuff it
again it totally didn't we by surprise
because I thought you know I've tried
wet-and-wild concealers in the past and
I have never really been that wildly
impressed there have been some that were
okay but like the coverall line I liked
pretty well wasn't my favorite but I did
like it this line is just better and
this I like it you know a simple doe
foot applicator but I've been using this
to kind of highlight through my face as
well as you see and I've liked it it
blends really well especially with the
Beauty Blender and I think it's got
pretty great coverage I do find that I
need to set it just a little bit which I
didn't show you here but I did end up
setting it just to make sure it doesn't
move because while I don't think it's
got a super oily finish I don't think
it's got a super matte finish so as you
said it same goes with the foundation
I set it with the next product I'm going
to mention which is these little focus
pressed powder I got in the shade 821 E
which is warm light just I think is a
pretty decent match for me this is a
domed product very pigmented
I like this powder I don't know that
it's like like some people like oh my
gosh it's just like the mac mineralize
skinfinish etc I think it's a similar
but I don't think it's as good but I do
think like I used it on my face today I
do think it does a good job of
mattifying your face to a certain degree
where it gets rid of a lot of shine if
you're trying to kind of soak up some
oil but it doesn't get rid of everything
where you're just completely mapped at
least for me and I know a lot of people
don't necessarily like the completely
matte look and so I think if you're like
me you probably will like this powder I
don't own
many pressed powders unless it's like a
powder foundation but just straight-up
mattifying press powders I don't own
many us but this is one that I could
totally get down with mostly just
because it doesn't 100% mattify your
face which is what I like so so I do
like it do I think it's like
groundbreaking no but for the price this
is an amazing product from the drugstore
all right the next products are their
mega glow highlighting powders I have
the shade precious petals and I'm
wearing this today and then I also the
shade crown of my canopy now crown of my
canopy let's let me show you some
swatches precious petals is a much more
golden and crowd of my canopy is even
more orange they're not that different
to be honest with you and I know you can
see that they're they're really not that
different this one really is just a
little bit more orange honestly guys
this is a good highlighting powder but
it's not there are a million
highlighting powders just like these at
the drugstore so if you're in need of
one I would still recommend it it does
the job of you know highlighting where
you want to highlight it definitely has
a lot of shimmer in it it definitely
gives a nice glow and actually the more
I kind of looked I've got a mirror right
here the more kind of looked at it the
more I've grown to really I do like the
glow it gives I even have it on the tip
of my nose today so the only product I
got from what well I'm trying to make
sure yeah I think I covered everything
then I wasn't really that impressed with
was this photo focus eyes shadow primer
I've tried so many other primers and
they're good none of them are really bad
but I was to be honest I was hoping he
was in a white thing I was hoping it was
a white primer because I used my NYX I
just recently repurchased the NYX jumbo
eye pencil in milk but it's not as easy
to blend that in so I was hoping this
was like a white primer so again it was
kind of my own fault but it's more of
like a beige color and you know you put
it on your eye it definitely has that
kind of silicone feel to it but I felt
like I don't usually have problems with
my eyeshadow staying with my eyeshadow
no matter what I wear it doesn't usually
crease on me
but with this I just felt like the
eyeshadow I'd worn on top of it every
time I used it kind of was faded by the
end of the day really just didn't do its
job as well as I'd hoped it would so for
me it wasn't a creasing issue it was a
it's just kind of everything on top of
it just faded and I was really
disappointed again I'm not too sad as
only a couple dollars but it's one that
I just don't think it's the best at the
drugstore so hopefully this video is
helpful for you I've always excited when
new lines of products come out from
makeup companies I'm also filming a best
Moore's of the new Milani products as
