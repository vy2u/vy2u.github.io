to be reviewing and swatching for you
guys the three brand new shades of the
wet and wild color icon ombre blush
these runs for around five dollars
sometimes you can find it a little bit
cheaper at like Walmart I will link
these below as well and list the shade
names but let's go ahead and get into my
review and swatches so as I mentioned
these are brand new at the drugstore and
the first one I'm gonna swatch for you
is called might I buy you a drink and
it's might I like ma ITA I like the
drink you know and it's just a really
pretty light peach shade and I think
this one is so beautiful they are all
really like shimmery and gorgeous but
this is one of my favorites because it
really is like a true pinky peach and I
find it to be flattering on a lot of
different skin tones I really really
like wearing this one but my true
favorite is this other one called the
princess daiquiris and this one is very
similar but it has just a little bit
more of a pink shift to it but it does
still kind of have a reminiscent peach
tone and what I like about it is again
it's got that beautiful shimmer where it
just makes your skin and your cheeks
look glowy but not like crazy shimmery
and so I feel like you can wear any of
these three and not have to worry about
putting a highlighter on or anything
like that but I like this one because
for my skin tone anyway it just looks
like the perfect amount of color or
pigment I know some people have talked
about these but specifically this one
the princess daiquiris and said that
they feel like it doesn't show up very
well so I think if you've got a deeper
skin tone than mine it might not show up
as well it might look a little frosty
but for me it is just the perfect shade
like I don't feel like I have to use a
really light hand to apply it which I
really like the last shade they have is
called in a purple haze and this one is
very different this one is a very blue
toned pink it reminds me of full of joy
from Mac which I think I wore on my
if I'm correct but it's even more
blue-toned this one has a little bit of
a shimmer as well but I really do feel
like on any skin tone whether your light
or deep this one really does look frosty
so it can look really pretty if you use
a light hand but it does have that thick
frosty shimmer to it where it looks
really unnatural and almost every light
I mean it probably look okay like in
these lights that I'm using but um you
know I don't know I like it and I'm
still going to use it for a while to see
you know a couple more times how it
looks on my skin but it's not one that I
trust fully just because it does have
that weird frosty blue tone to it the
wear time on these is actually
surprisingly great I put this on around
like 6 a.m. and when I get done teaching
by around like 3:30 or 4 it's still on
now it's not as flawless as what I put
it on which virtually my makeup is
virtually never that flawless by the end
of a teaching day but these still look
pretty good you can still see the color
and the shimmer and the pigment whereas
some washes will wear off by like 3
hours in so I was very surprised by the
wear time on these the packaging is nice
as well I like that it is just what it
needs to be there's no like extra room
for a brush that you're never going to
use it's just really simple thick
plastic packaging I think the price
point of 5 dollars is the perfect price
for this think of already cheaper it
might not be as long wearing like they
might have maybe made some adjustments
in the formula to make it cheaper five
dollars is perfect because they really I
mean I was very impressed with these now
of course the ombre claim is just
because it's got a lighter color on the
top and it goes a little bit deeper like
a true ombre but I don't know that you
could truly apply with the brush to make
it look like it's like highlight then
blush I mean maybe but I mean really
it's just beautiful just swirl together
these don't have a noticeable scent at
all so if you're sensitive to smells I
don't think it would bother you in any
way I can mention I found mine at um I
might have even found mine at Target I
will link below where I found it now
that I'm think about it might have been
Target but these are the only three
shades they have I really like it
obviously my favorite is the princess
daiquiris second favorite would be might
I buy you a drink
and then obviously last would be in a
purple haze hopefully this review was
helpful for you guys if you'd like to
see more of my drugstore review and
swatch videos I do a lot of drugstore
lip swatch videos just to compare
different colors in certain drugstore
lines I will link my playlists below and
I will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
