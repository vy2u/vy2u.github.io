you a review of three new shades of the
Maybelline Color tattoo line now this is
part of their rebel bloom line for
spring 2013 and they also had like some
new or at least reproduction lipsticks
nail polishes they had a new I don't
remember if there was more than one
shade but a new master Studio cream
blush stick but it was like matte so
that's something I'm thinking about
getting let me know if you'd be
interested to see a review in that the
one that I do have from the Maybelline
master like cream stick blush line I
have in the shade barely pink and I
actually really really like it it's an
amazing blush very very shimmery but it
I got I ended up finding it like Big
Lots for like two or three dollars this
year and I loved it it's such a pretty
pretty color but it's also a good
formula so I might end up picking up the
matte version of this but let me know if
you'd be interested regardless what I
ended up getting were three of the color
tattoos and so what I have noticed about
Maybelline Color tattoos is that they
seem to range like they're formula from
color to color to me is not always the
same and actually over the past year or
two I had owned a lot of their you know
permanent collection line as well as
limited edition and I'd always noticed
that sometimes limited edition ones
weren't as good as the permanent line it
just never seemed to be consistent I
have heard that Maybelline had kind of
reformulated their color tattoos a while
back ago to be a little bit better I
don't know if that's true or not so I
picked up three of them and let's go
through and I'll swatch each of them for
you I'm actually wearing one of them
today I'll show you that one first
this is hydrangea hype and I'm wearing
it just on my lids today and it's a very
kind of certainly purple color but it
has a silver tint to it and if you've
never used the Maybelline Color tattoos
before or if you've never used a cream
eyeshadow before the idea of these is
that you can use it as just strictly an
all-over color so you could put it all
over your lid and
today and that be that these really do
not crease at all which means they don't
fall into any wrinkles or fine lines or
anything you've got going on on your
eyelids they stay put and they look the
way they are from the moment you put
them on to the moment you take them off
at the end of the day so that's one
thing I love the staying power of these
is amazing you can also use them as kind
of a primer so if you're going to put on
powder shadow you could use one of these
that would maybe go well with your eye
look and you can put that on and then
put powder shadow on top and it's going
to hold onto that shadow so the shadows
stays in place all day as well
and also doesn't crease so there's a lot
of different ways you can use these and
of course they have a lot more neutral
colors that are even better for everyday
use but so this one like I said is a
very silvery metallic but with a hint of
purple in it which is why it's called
hydrangea hype and this one I like a lot
it is a very smooth formula it goes on
evenly the first time you apply it with
your fingers I don't like to apply these
with brushes I know some people who use
like a synthetic brush to wipe it on
your lid but I my fingers do very well
and it provides the most even
application of these so that's how I
always use them so this one I'm wearing
alone with just like a light shadow like
a powder shadow I think from Milani in
my crease and that's it so it was just
this because I really like the color the
way it is the next one that I picked up
is probably my favorite out of all of
them and it's called hibiscus heartbreak
and this is just a really beautiful
lavender pink but it has this gorgeous
shimmer to it that is unlike anything
now one thing I will say about the
formula of this one even though it is
the most beautiful shimmery pink and
I've worn it a few times already and I
love it it doesn't crease so it stays
put the way all of them do but this one
is a little bit more sheer so when you
first watch it I'll show you nice
watching it so I've rubbed it in quite a
bit and when you first swatch it it kind
of goes on you'll see kind of spotty and
you know as you rub it in it kind of I
guess what I'm saying is it's not as
even of an application as the other
color tattoos are now the good news is
this isn't real
that big of a deal because the times
that I've worn it on my eyes it's never
once I blended it out well enough it's
never looked patchy if you're wanting a
more opaque look of this color you're
just gonna maybe need to put on an extra
layer so it's not a deal breaker and
honestly I have never owned a cream
shadow that's this color it is so
beautiful with so many different looks
it looks great with gold look see great
looks great with silvery I mean it
literally could look good with anything
so I even though it's not the best
formula out of all of them I still love
this and still would recommend the color
now the last shade that I picked up is
called black orchid and it is kind of
more of a topi color it reminded me at
first of their permanent collection
color tattoo that's called toughest
taupe and while this is a taupe color
that's very similar it is a lot more
metallic then that one is I just said
some italic this one I think is a great
base for a smoky look so if you know
you're gonna be doing a darker look on
your lid I think this is an amazing base
that would work underneath dark brows
but would also work underneath red tones
and maroon tones and even blues and
greens I think because it's so metallic
it would work under so many different
colors especially if you're going a
darker route so I really really liked
this now similar products that I have
tried that remind me of this would
probably be the Mary Kay creme shadows
that I've been talking about recently
that I do like there are similar
consistency and they're staying power I
think these are better and they're a lot
cheaper but I think these are better
because they are more opaque right off
the bat versus the Mary Kay ones but
other cream shadows that are out there
that I like Mac Paint Pots are more
expensive but they're a similar
consistency again I think color tattoos
are more pigmented I think they're more
opaque than even the Mac ones that I
have tried never only tried like five of
the math ones but I think these have
more color payoff than maybelline ones
do and then there's also the elf smudge
pots which I love I actually there's one
called back-to-basics that's one of my
favorite in their three bucks that I
mentioned in my February favorites video
and those are amazing and the same
powers to say
miss fees but there are totally
different consistency these are like a
the elf ones are like a whipped formula
and so you have to almost like let them
dry for a second but they're really good
as well those are three dollars these
maybelline ones range from five dollars
to seven or eight dollars depending on
where you buy them they're always on
sale Maybelline always has buy one get
one half off at Walgreens CVS anywhere
so keep your eyes peeled for these if I
had to recommend one of them to you I
think I would recommend the hibiscus
heartbreak one which is that pink one I
showed you even though the formula is
not quite as good as the other two I
think the color is so different and so
beautiful and especially at springtime
and I feel like pink is something I
don't wear on my eyes as much and some
people I mean I'm not a big fan of pink
on my eyes to be honest sometimes it
makes your eyes look a little more tired
but this one doesn't do that and it's so
beautiful on its own under shadow and
it's just different I love that it is
just different again I love all of these
and I also really do like the one I'm
wearing the hydrangea hype today because
it's a nice cool shadow that I think
would work year-round especially in the
winter time honestly and again it's a
it's a nice kind of neutral II base but
with a little bit of a pop of that
little bit of purple color so I really
like that as well
a lot of the limited edition spring
collections from any makeup line are
hard to find I have a store named me
called Meyer if you live in the Midwest
like Michigan Indiana Ohio that area and
you have a Meijer near you you'll
probably be able to find these there on
an end cap I know that a lot of times
you can find them at Walgreens they're
pretty good about having new collections
out I never have any luck at CVS finding
new collections so let me know if you
are able to find it let me know if you
know if these are available online
anywhere I haven't I kind of glanced and
I couldn't find them but if you found
them maybe after this has been posted
let me know down below so everyone else
can find them if they're looking for
them I hope this review is helpful for
