going to be doing a love with food
unboxing this video is sponsored by love
with food and you guys know I'm always
up front about that I usually say it
within the first few seconds of the darn
video but I love this box I've unboxed
it before my channel within the past
year I would say but what I really like
about this company is that they actually
donate a meal to people in need for
every box sold and I think that is
amazing you know I unbox a lot of
subscription boxes on my channel and of
course most of those are makeup related
things like that but we also get
food-related boxes and this is the only
one that I've received that does that
and I think that's so neat so they have
two different types of boxes and they
start at $19 a month um this is the
deluxe box that I actually have a 40%
off link down below if you're interested
in trying it 40% off is a nice chunk
which i think is cool so the deluxe box
has 16 to 20 different snacks in it
we're gonna try all of them today I
might have to wipe off this little bit
let's tap that down because I'm a cabbie
and something else to note they have
international boxes now so Canada the UK
Australia and then there's like 23 other
countries that this now ships to I know
they add like a 399 shipping to it if
you are international but I think it's
cool that they finally do ship there so
if you're interested definitely check it
out I'm thinking about getting my mom
the gluten free subscription which is 10
to 12 snacks in the box because my mom
is gluten free I know she would love it
and it'd be such a surprise each month
when she gets it and what I love about
the box is regardless they're all either
organic or very natural snacks which is
awesome so let's go ahead and I'm gonna
stop jabber and I'm getting hungry so
let's go ahead and open up so when you
open it there is a little it says love
is adventure let's just say oh and it
goes through all the snacks and info
about it so that's pretty it says
whether it's gluten free or if it's
vegan or dairy free etc so I'm so
excited this is what it looks like when
you open it up there's a ton I already
see the one I'm starting with so this
first one is from band R and it's their
non chips now I love non periods so I'm
really excited a new twist on the
classic Indian flatbread and it says
it's 60% less fat than the leading
pita chip that's pretty cool so let us
try it out and if you get this box like
if you got the same box or if you get it
next month let me know below like which
ones you like the best because I know
you can like if you like one you can go
on and buy like a full size of the
product so I think that's awesome cuz
that's the one thing it's like oh great
I loved it but what do I do now like
where do I get it you can actually order
it on their site they have a little bit
of salt it looks like a Tim Elaine pink
salt which is awesome it's what we use
um I think I might like these better
than pita chips they're a little bit
thinner which means they're a little bit
crispier which i think is awesome if I
want to try this in some hummus next
thing is this super seeds gourmet
pumpkin seeds with sea salt so there's
no shells small-batch dry roasted all
natural I love pumpkin seeds also that
gets me excited for fall anyone else
excited for fall even though it's only
like August I am alright here we go I
liked its resealable I might take these
- a lot of these are gonna go with me to
work mmm mmm yeah these are really good
they don't have too much salt which I
appreciate because I feel like some
pumpkin seeds that you just straight up
buy are so covered in salt it's like too
much it's just like mmm next thing in
here is this mini Jimmy bar clean snack
bar it says how about dem apples I
presume that is the flavor that's
awesome
it's got dates almond butter apple crisp
brown rice oats walnuts honey vanilla
and cinnamon awesome let's open it I'm
gonna have a ton of like half-eaten
things here it's going to be interesting
okay so it looks like I can get it
looking just like a little bar let's try
it
mmm
hmm big on big like it has a straight
that sounds funny they said in food not
going on bake not big on dates but they
kind of mask the date tastes pretty well
it kind of you can kind of taste if it's
just sweet and it does have that apple
flavor which is perfect so I really like
that's really chewy next thing are these
Benito's baked white bean crunch mac and
cheese I like that because Tyler and I
have been trying to we don't need a lot
of meat anymore we're not vegetarians
but could we definitely still love
chicken except we don't eat a lot of red
meat just generally and so we've been
looking at ways to replace it and so
we've done a lot of beans and a lot of
like chickpeas which are also being
still but um
and a lot of lentils so that's kind of
cool let us try it it's like a Cheeto
bomb way better mmm-hmm
like those are so good like I've
literally want to keep eating more I've
got stuff I got say fruit next thing is
the old fashioned confections Oh mandis
is the brand rich chocolate cookie thins
thin and crisp with a sprinkle of sugar
all natural it has 90 calories let us
see y'all I'm trying to go back and
forth between likes eat sweet and salty
so I don't get like tired of any one
thing so far I've gotten tired of
nothing mmm
they give you this would be perfect like
if you've got a sweet tooth but you're
like and like I'm trying not to eat you
know ton of sugar perfect cuz it kind of
satisfies it but it's not that bad for
you it has that cocoa taste it's really
good
all right move along yay we got two
things of non chips
well I won't open this I'm gonna let my
husband eat the next one but perfect I
think we have some hummus that's sweet
yeah there's a lot in here okay this we
got two of these so again I'll save one
for my husband these had frozen it's the
pure growth organic sea salt popcorn
perfect I eat popcorn almost every day
and if you watch me for a while you know
that I love popcorn hey perfect simple
Airy light
lightly salted it's exactly the way I
like them hmm it's organic gluten-free
kosher no artificial colors or flavors
no cholesterol no trans fat no MSG
perfect just the way I like my popcorn
oh there are two of the chocolate things
yeah I'm totally bringing these four so
this next thing there are two of these I
kind of liked it there's two because
then if you like it you've got it or you
can share it like a view of a husband or
even kids like kids would love this so
these are the Luna protein bar very
Greek yogurt and it's got 12 grams of
protein it's gluten free we're gonna try
one of these see this would be awesome
like when I'm rushing around during my
prep time and I'm hungry teach your life
I'm always hungry news flash so it's
covered in yogurt oh yeah I'm gonna be
honest I don't typically like things
that are like yogurt covered but this
one has this flavor and maybe it's the
berries in it what does it make me think
of there's some kind of cereal it makes
me think of that's really really good I
don't know this is actually tasty so I'm
excited about that I'm kind of gonna
save it maybe that'll be my like snack
later my for real snack
this is tons of sex next thing are these
pretzel perfection twice-baked pretzel
sticks tomato basil yes that's like my
favorite like I remember we were in
Europe somewhere and they had tomato
basil like potato chips I was like oh my
gosh they were so good
kind of in France so they look like tiny
LeBron sticks oh I dropped four of them
in the box oh my gosh these are so good
hi there's gonna die when he tries these
pretzels themselves kind of boring right
like unless you just love pretzels just
straight-up pretzels are just kind of
boring like this if you like tomato and
it's kind of got a sweet and savory but
you guys just see me spit sorry I'm
sloppy eater my mom would just die um
it's just good this is good we've got
some sauces this is the spicy mango
chili sauce this is try it with samosas
pizza and french fries and we also have
tomato ketchup which is masala spice
these are both from that band our brand
which is the same brand as the naan
chips um so it says try this with
Burgers kebabs and french fries so both
go with french fries I don't want to
open these right now because I want to
like genuinely enjoy them but I'm
excited because again kind of like
pretzels regular ketchup is just kind of
like to me I know a lot of people love
it but it's I've never been really big
on it but I do like spicy or at least
kind of flavored things so I will like
it Tyler will love the spicy spice cuz
he loves that so we will definitely try
that oh this is this ritual peanut and
chocolate caffeinated energy snack it
says this snack
was one coffee that is amazing like
think about those days when you you made
coffee for yourself and you're trying to
drink if you're out the door you can't
bring it with you this would be the
ideal thing to kind of fill in the gaps
cuz for me i 100% must have coffee
so it's this big I feel it's kind of
like stick not sticky but kind of you
know what I mean like moist sorry if you
don't like that word mmm it's just good
slow down you've already had tons of
coffee today mmm I would rather have
this and like those weird energy drinks
I don't know how you guys do it I know a
lot of people and I've got friends that
drink like the 5-hour energies and stuff
and Red Bulls and there's this taste in
it that I'm just like blue but this
actually tastes really good and it has
caffeine so I'm all about it that's
awesome next thing in here are these
young earth sour beans who has loved
sour flavor candy so it's naturally
flavored no synthetic colors horses
gluten-free fat for you peanut free
vegan no soy do a etcetera let's try it
my dad loves jelly beans here we go
we're getting three to suck yeah
hmm oh my gosh they're so good if you
like salt you're a salt sour you're
gonna love this I really do like sour I
just have to make the face don't you
whoa hmm and if you look at them the
colors are really like understated
because there are no like synthetic
colors I think that's awesome hold on
because there's no need for those bright
colors and if they're just nonsense that
we're putting in our bodies why even do
it so I really respect that I think
that's awesome all right there are two
more edible things in here well this is
one in the next one these are these true
joy sweets little suckers I want to read
about this cuz the rest of them had like
packaging but that one I'm curious about
these so they're organic lollipops

sure this is what it looks like a little
pear and this is like a little hard it's

try the heart cuz it looks cute here we
go what is wrong with me I bit it last
food item in here is this pure mints and

breath smells amazing after eating all
that so it's kind of perfect although

I know what your favorites are down
below I'm curious and if you have any
recommendations maybe you know of other
products from these different brands
that I should try let me know I'm always
into a little bit healthier of snacks
like I said I'm a teacher so for me like
when I'm on the go I don't have time to
sit and like delicately make tiny salads
on my fork out of my salad has anyone
heard that joke before where we need a
salad like you who is easy I'm sorry
maybe that made that joke where you got
a salad young oh this is great I'm being
healthy but every time you're trying to
eat a bite you're trying to make a
miniature salad on your fork you're like
okay I need some of the greens I need
the tomato a crouton you know boiled egg
whatever it is you have on it so you're
always trying to make miniature salads
on your fork for each by it takes so
much work it's so true so I don't always
have time to do that so this is perfect
I like to know that what I'm eating
isn't just you know Pringles or just
straight-up Lay's potato chips it's at
least a little bit more natural and
healthy so I hope that you enjoyed this
video if you're interested I've got my
