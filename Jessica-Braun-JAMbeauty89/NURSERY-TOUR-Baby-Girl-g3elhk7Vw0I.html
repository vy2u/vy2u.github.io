going to share with you my nursery tour
so know this is not the nursery this is
our bedroom
but I figured I'd sit down and film an
intro at least so you can see my face if
you've never seen me before hi I'm
Jessica so I am 38 weeks pregnant at the
time I'm filming this I'm tired and I'm
kind of at that spot where I'm like okay
I technically could go into labor at any
minute I need to like actually sit down
and fill this nursery to her so here we
are
so this nursery we are big Disney fans
so but we also are neutral fans like you
look at our room very neutral really our
house for the most part is neutral so we
wanted to kind of get this to meld those
two worlds together Disney and the fact
that we like neutral nice things so um
but we also knew of course it's for a
baby it's gonna change over time she's
gonna have a personality of her own and
say I want my room to be bright yellow
like alright so we really love it's
actually the color on our walls in here
is the same color we used in there so I
know a lot of people will ask what the
paint colors so I will put that below
because I know my husband knows the
exact like color our Beagle Pinocchio is
under the bed right now you coming out
Pinocchio can you say hi mommy
he's gonna be such a jealous beagle
you're gonna be so jealous I'm in
sleeping under the bed took him on a
walk earlier because I'm trying to still
be good about walking and we're both
tired anyway so so we do have a lot of
Disney splashes but it's not like so
many people I worked with for like oh
are you gonna have like it's just gonna
be like all like red and black Mickey
I'm like no like we really it's just
you'll see so I'll stop blabbering I'll
let you guys see I know that not
everything's perfect in there and there
are gonna be things that you know as she
gets older and starts to crawl and walk
and pull things down and stand and hold
on to things obviously there are things
that are gonna need to move but for this
newborn stage where really she's just
not moving around much we know that a
lot of it is more useful for us for
example like having a table next to our
seat well eventually that table will
need to move so just kind of getting
that clear in the air with that now we
are quite aware but
we'll figure things out as we go but we
of course will take any advice you guys
would like to give an a loving and
caring manner down below but other than
that let's go ahead and get into the
tour alrighty so here is our nursery I
mean it's a part of it um so I'm gonna
take you around and show you the details
I'm sure I have a lot of questions so
I'll try to link big items that we have
bought a lot of this there were some
things that were given to us or were
kind of heirlooms so I won't be able to
link those but I'll link whatever I can
um I'm already out of breath my goodness
so let's go ahead and look closer
alright so first things first this
little giraffe here was sent to us by a
lovely subscriber and I just love it
there's something about giraffes and
nurseries that like both Tyler and I
felt strongly that we really wanted a
tall giraffe in the nursery I don't know
why and so then this chair here is
actually from Ikea and I can link that
it was semi inexpensive it doesn't rock
or recline or anything like that but
it's really really comfy
we actually had bought two for our
bedroom but only one fit in there in our
little seating area so we put the other
one in here and the pillows from Ikea
and the blanket here is Mickey Mouse
blanket that has like little stars and
stuff that have subscribers sent and
then this table I bought on HauteLook
for I buy a lot of things like 50% on
off on HauteLook so I'll link it below
if it's still available especially I'll
link it but it's kind of hard to link
things on that site because they're
flash sales so they go after a few days
but I really liked it because I just
wanted something with the drawer that I
could put like snacks for while I'm
breastfeeding just a little quick grab
and go kind of items assuming I'll be
sitting there from time to time feeding
so in just a place you know a surface
where I could set you know my water
bottle or something now this we've
attached most of the stuff to the wall
this has not been but it did come with
stuff so Tyler's planning on attaching
it to the wall so doesn't tip but
honestly once she's starting to pull
pull on things pull herself up it's not
going to be in here anyway so we're
planning on moving now actually to our
entryway once we're done with it in here
so that is that area and then here we
just have a plant for now we just wanted
some greenery in here green plants are
so good at cleaning the air now
and eventually we'll have to move it but
that will be the theme of this there are
many things we're gonna have to move but
right here is a little oh I need to move
this I didn't realize it blocked it
let's see close enough anyway right now
I have some like blankets for tummy time
and stuff but we also have some toys in
there for her figured you might want to
close up so as we go in here deeper I've
got some little blankies and things I
just recently washed all of these some
things that are still in their packaging
but just little toys and rattles lovely
things that you guys have sent and
things we got from our baby shower some
things I've purchased so all kinds of
cute things lots of Disney lots and lots
and lots of Disney so love all of this
and this is really nice because you
can't really slam your fingers in it and
there's this area where your fingers can
go closes so I thought that was a really
cool toy chest and actually a mom from
my classroom bought that for me and that
was really really sweet so student and
their family I'm showing you this side
of the room yet
so I'll close up a little bit the crib
we actually were given from my sister
she had it so it was all cleaned up and
Tyler reassemble it here and then of
course we've got her own bedding and
then we've got this cute little what do
you call those that hang over the crib
I'm not sure but it's really really
sweet we love the little lambs just cute
and we have some bedding we just
recently washed a bunch of stuff on
there just the sheet really he's all
that it's gonna go in there over here we
have a rocker that actually was passed
down I think it was his Tyler's
grandparents a lovely family friend of
ours is actually reupholstering the
cushion that originally came with it and
a little step stool like a footrest so
for now we bought this like $5 little
cushion from Ikea and then the hamper I
also bought on HauteLook and I like it
because excuse the baby bump I like it
because you can remove the liner so if
there's a bunch of like soiled stuff in
there I can remove the liner and
actually wash it really really easily so
I need to take the tag off but I thought
that was pretty nice for now it's gonna
be out here ideally I wanted it in the
closet but honestly when I show you guys
there are two closets in here and when I
show those to you you'll see that we
really right now don't have room
I think we will maybe eventually we'll
see and then that blanket was a handmade
one that one of you guys sent to me we
have a lot of amazing handmade blankets
that I'm so excited to cuddle her up in
this is right above the crib here and
these are a bunch of Disney lithographs
that actually were my mother-in-law's
and she had them in like their library
and different rooms they had in their
house and they're just really special so
I just bought some new frames for him
and these were all like the dreamy
nighttime ones so we figured those would
look really nice over the over the oh my
gosh and I forgot to show you guys over
here by the giraffe this special this
special print here was made by one of
you guys and it really made me emotional
if you saw our p.o box baby shower hall
on Tyler's channel I'll link that below
I got really emotional with this because
Tyler and I met doing Aloud and he was
playing a lot and I was playing Jasmine
had a theatre where we live and on top
of that he's a travel agent we travel
everywhere so it's like I don't know it
really just got to me and I absolutely
loved so I bought a frame for that and
that's hang in there I didn't want to
not mention that so we also have this
diaper pail here this is from bub EULA
I'm not sure how to say it it was sent
to us by subscriber and when I was
buying some liner refills for it someone
was saying they saw me near and they it
was a mom she's a young young baby in
her arms and she said oh my gosh I have
that and it is amazing you will not
smell a single diaper I'm like that is
awesome so what I love the gray it goes
with our kind of grey and pink motif
that we've got going on here but this
piece of furniture here is from Ikea as
well and I can definitely link that
what's nice is it's mounted to the wall
so it's not going anywhere but the
changing table portion of it here is
really sturdily on there and you can
remove it and it's just a regular
bookshelf so once she's kind of old
enough that we don't really need it then
we can take it down and it's just a
bookshelf or which I thought was perfect
because just having a changing table for
just a changing table stakes seemed
not wasteful because I I wanted a
changing table but I wanted something
that I could use for more than one
purpose for a little longer so that was
pretty cool so let's get closer to this
stuff so we have all of her stuffed
animals up here so we got a Dumbo we
bought at a garage sale and washed and
actually I think was at a garage sale of
one of you guys which was really cool
Tyler's Barney from when he was younger
really I need to I might want to watch
this again um we got a poohbear the
sweet doll that was made for her you
guys sent so many sweet things so all of
her little stuffed animals they're just
looking out on her up there for now
I figure eventually she might actually
want to play with them but know if they
don't need to be and so then here these
are these these were from Bye Bye Baby
that I registered for a bunch of these
and so we've just got some new board
diapers this white pail I just recently
bought I haven't opened the wipes inside
I figure I'll start with water wipes
they're kind of expensive though solo
seat but anyway I liked this because I
have this waited this is really weighted
so it holds down the white so you can
truly pull against it and pull one wipe
out so that's all that we have in this
and then we've got this changing table
this this actual pad is for Mikey as
well is really inexpensive and then the
cover one of you guys sent us and it's
so soft we have a couple mini ones now
so they're all washed and ready to go
cuz I figure well you need to wash them
quite often and then back here we have
this foaming hand sanitizer from baby
Ganic
and some Aveeno baby lotion and some
Butt Paste so this is more of a close-up
of this if you wanted to see but you
literally put the diaper in here close
it and then you push this and it
literally opens it so the diaper falls
into the trashcan so you're never really
exposing the smell to the air more than
it needs to be if that makes sense so I
thought that was really really cool I
mean it and what's nice is I was
actually buying liners for this like
trash can back basically just bags and
then after I bought them I realized that
it actually says on the box for the
trash can no need for expense
Ziv custom liners like dang it Oh anyway
either way I'm gonna use the ones I have
but that's that is nice cuz I know like
with the diaper genie don't you have to
have like the specific fitted liners in
it I don't know I've never had one so I
wouldn't know but I'm sure you guys will
you can let us know below so down here
we've got board books on that top like
shelf there and then just haul our books
down here we have some board books oh I
love books and so it was very exciting
as her little library collection grew
and grew it was just exciting to kind of
keep together and I just sometimes I'll
just sit in here and just read books can
you tell we need to vacuum we've got
these adorable little Mickey and
Minnie's that you guys sent but I
literally just have some like well so
like the trash can liners and I've got
gripe water just different things we
might need like a little brush I just
haven't opened the Nosefrida
no sucker thing more but pace we have a
bunch of burp cloths that are already
washed and ready to go and I figured
that'd be nice to have really quickly we
can grab it really easily so now we have
this section this was actually a dresser
I've had for a long time I think like I
got it from one of my best friends when
she was like moving out and didn't want
it I was like I'll take it so I used it
for years and then now we're using it
for a little baby so we've got a lot of
her clothes and sleepers and things like
that I'll show you some of the drawers
here in a second but then we also have
how many weeks I am gosh
going on 39 again some things that are
really really cute but we'll have to
move as she gets older this actually was
a bouquet that my mother-in-law made for
my wedding and I just hope so pretty and
then this little aladdin and Jasmine one
of you guys sent and I thought that was
so sweet and then this is our hatch baby
rest it's a night light basically it
turns on and it plays different sounds
you can set it with the app you can set
it to be a certain color at different
times and that's kind of nice because as
you're kind of sleep training your kiddo
and depending on how you do it and I
need to do a lot of research on that but
there's a lot of different things you
can use that for and you control with an
app it's just really cool and then we
got her a little piggy bank in a little
lamp the piggy bank was from byebye baby
and then the lamp I just found these two
pieces separately the
liam shaytan alam so i they were at like
random bargain store so i can't really
tell you where we got them from and then
up here we've got some more disney
prince we got Pocahontas Toy Story and
Aurora Sleeping Beauty but let's look
into some of those drawers there they're
organized enough but I mean I would like
to eventually actually use organizers
and I have some I just haven't done it
yet but we've got like her socks and her
little hats and things like that some of
them are washed over here these have not
been washed yet trying to keep them
separate but anyway so yeah just I need
to organize I know and then in here
she's got all of her bows boy this
little girl already has so many bows
again I'd like to organize it I know
there's a lot of cute Pinterest DIYs for
holding all the bows that I could put up
on the dresser kind of thinking about
doing that and then just some cute
sunglasses and shoes she has that she's
not gonna quite fit into yet that I'm
excited for her to fit in and then in
here is kind of just miscellaneous we've
got something that I might take to the
hospital that one of you guys sent a
cute little like newborn photo and just
some hats and diaper covers things like
that that again need to be organized
these two drawers I've got some these
are actually mostly Swaddlers or
sleepers so most of these are like size
small or newborn some of them are 0 to 3
month but they're all washed and ready
to go I even got some hand-me-downs like
these halo sleep sacks are so expensive
so I gotten one from my registry and
then my sister had one she just gave me
cuz they're expensive and once you wash
it you know it's in just fine condition
so anyway so that's what's in there down
here is mostly unopened stuff or stuff
she's just not gonna fit into yet so
someone sees that her six to nine month
sum that's another cute little kind of
sleeper but it's medium things like that
so they their time will come but it's
just not yes and then in this drawer a
lot more newborn zero to three month
things these are all washed so some of
them are outfits again it's not super
organized but I kind of met that point
where I tried organizing these already
and I'm like I don't really know like
until I am used to the size she is when
she's born and all that stuff it's
really kind of hard to do so I've kind
of stopped myself these are all clean
they're ready to go and as I get used to
our routine I think I'll have a better
idea of how I
to organize it you know what I mean just
that it's ansible
and down here some more stuff some stuff
that's not quite right yeah this is
three months so it'll be soon and just
some other cute outfits and little PJ's
onesies things like that and even again
some of these are even hand-me-down step
we're from my sister that I watched made
a fire here I haven't used yet that some
co-workers got for me for the room which
was so sweet and I think that's a good
spot for it we have one in our bedroom
too and actually it's like the same one
but in white the brand is creme I can
link it but this one came with a filter
replacement which I thought was great
because the one I have does not but I'm
just gonna kind of wait until closer to
to get that started I'm gonna show you
inside the closets just bear with me
because they are messy they're also
pretty dark so let me just Pan you down
so these I have both both closets are
about the same size and I have these in
both I can link them below if I can find
where I bought them I think I just
bought them all on Amazon honestly both
the white thing and the actual boxes but
in there I have everything organized
like I've got a thing for I've got a
thing for blankets that are washed like
swaddling blankets I've got bibs etc so
it's kind of nice to have them organized
especially since you know sometimes you
have a lot of one thing and it's like
well I don't want to open it until I
know I'm gonna need it or use it because
then if I want to donate it in the
future because I didn't use it it'd be
nice for it to still be new for that
person so that's kind of our mo here and
so we've got a lot of things unopened in
there but it's kind of nice to have it's
still organized in its categories so
then here this actually needs to be hung
this is our camera I can link it it was
expensive and honestly you guys I read
so many reviews and so I've already
download the app and played with it and
it's really clear future Jesse here so
this is fast forward a few weeks and now
I'm 40 weeks pregnant and my husband did
hang this monitor it is awesome it
doesn't come with sandal monitors you
have to use it with your smartphone I
really like I did a lot of
Church and both of us are pretty happy
with it and it does a lot more than just
the video which is cool but he installed
and I think he's gonna show in a vlog on
his channel how he does this so that the
cord is not hanging so the baby can't
grab it and then the cord just comes out
down there and plugs in so these are
like really cheap on Amazon it's not
that hard to do and he's just gonna show
it in our vlog so I'll link his channel
if you want to see that but I figured
you might be interested to see and it's
cool cuz on the app I mean we can see
everything and then this camera moves
around so on the app we can just swipe
and it will show basically the entire
room it's so cool this is another cool
baby shower gift we got has a little
light there for late night changes and
so I've just kind of got these sweet
bags I want to put in my diaper bag that
a subscriber made and just some diapers
etc in there so it's sitting there for
now but eventually it'll be like
downstairs where we'll need it you know
so yeah tons of diapers a little boppy
lounger and then up here are her clothes
so I do have them organized from like
newborn 0 to 3 to 3 3 to 6 and then in
the other closet I kept it going yep the
tags on a lot of them just for that same
reason that I've heard so many horror
stories of people saying oh yeah we had
all these you know newborn clothes or
zero to three month clothes and so we
watched all of them and then we hardly
wore any of them before she grew out of
them so I wanted to make sure that we
were really ready to use them before I
took the tags off wash them so most of
the newborn stuff is washed and ready to
go just because obviously I wanted to be
somewhat prepared there but that's kind
of our plan there and the white hangers
we use again we're from byebye baby
they're pretty cheap but they're perfect
and then up with up above we've just got
some storage so we've got our little
wraps we're gonna eventually pull out
and use with her as she gets a little
bigger shopping cart cover and just more
diapers and wipes so so this pink the
pink box there is wipes and then we've
got more typers and actually the diapers
in that pink bag are size 1 and they
were ones that my students the my the
parents in my classroom I'm a 5th grade
teacher I think most of you guys know
that but if you don't the parents in my
classroom threw a shower for me and the
students were all excited and so
one of the things they did was they
wrote funny messages on the diapers so I
thought that was really cute and I was
cracking up reading some of them so that
is this closet we it is packed full I
know that eventually you know those
diapers won't be in there and slowly but
surely will work through a lot of this
so it'll open up a lot of space but it
is nice like I said this is a really
thin quick way to use up the floor space
on the closet a little bit better than
just having it open and I really did
like that so the other closet is here
behind our door so we're gonna go over
there now again we have the same
organizer down there I need to scooch it
over a little bit but we have the same
organizer and I think in these what do I
have so I have feeding and bottles and
stuff that we're not gonna be using
right off the bat there and then really
I have like clean fitted sheets and
things like that in these so not very
exciting stuff but again it's nice to
have organized and ready to go and as
you look up you can see our two diaper
bags so eventually once I have the baby
and we get used to life with a baby I'll
do it what's in my diaper bag video but
I can link the one I have below it's
this really cute pink kind of book bag
style that a lot of people have from
skip hop that I love and then Tyler has
his manly diaper bag there and you got a
blankie one of you guys made I've got my
breastfeeding pillow back there as you
go up we've got more clothes but these
are the larger sizes so just kind of
moving up through the sizes all the way
up to like you'll get 18 month in there
so it's nice we are very blessed to have
the space of two closets if it's wild
how quickly it gets filled you know and
right now like we've got our high chair
box back there because we don't need to
put it together yet and so there's
things taking up space down below on top
of it all that again will be free space
and then up above that we've got like
pacifiers and things up there and extra
toiletries diaper rash cream and then
just some toys that she really won't be
able to play with until she's much older
similar sand dug toys and little puzzles
so they're just kind of sitting in the
wings up there waiting I have to show
you this though hold on this is a 40 so
it's gonna be a while but Tyler it was
on like clearance at I think Babies R Us
was going out of business so we
opted-in and he was he said I want to
get this for us then if we're ever going
to like a little play in the wintertime
like I hope it's a winter because this
is certainly I want to outfit that she
can wear it and I thought that is
adorable
okay we're buying it I don't even care
the price by the way these pink hangers
are from Ikea and they're really cute
they're chuck their children hangers but
they're like nice wood so if you wanted
something different than like the white
plastic those are there so I think the
last thing I didn't show you is that we
do have like a shag rug it was actually
when we use have in my closet and I just
moved it out here so that is our nursery
I feel very at peace I feel like it's
ready the things that need to be washed
or washed you know there's only so much
you can do before your baby arrives
especially if it's your first baby like
it is ours I there's only so much I can
plan for and so now we just wait and I
can't wait for her to use this room and
it'll change and grow with her of course
but I'm just I'm excited I think I'm at
that point my pregnancy where I'm ready
to be done but I'm I'm just very at
peace
I feel very ready I mean knowing that
there's so much I don't know I'm as
ready as I will be and so for that I'm
thankful and thank you to all of you
guys anyone that sent just well wishes
prayers sweet cards and gifts and
homemade things we love it all and so if

nook and cranny cuz I would have taken
