to be doing a review and swatches of the
$2 and I mean like a dollar 99 or 99
cents when they're on sale
NYC expert last lip colors I have five
different shades I'm gonna swatch for
you both on my lips and on my hand so
you can kind of compare the colors at
the end so you can see what they look
like side by side so let's go ahead and
get into the swatches and then
afterwards I'll talk about the pros and
cons of this product and whether or not
I think it's worth picking up
so obviously these are very pigmented
very creamy I think they go on very
creamy Lee um the one I'm wearing on my
lips right now is creamy mauve and it's
the one I originally bought that I was
kind of drawn to because it's just such
a nice I mean I almost would call it mob
because to me at least on my lips it's
very almost pinky but it's the perfect
light pink I just think it's so wearable
it doesn't look weird in person because
some light Pink's at least on me just
look like too kind of Barbie like if you
know what I mean by that reference it
just very looks almost too young on me
than what I don't so I really really
like this battle know where I was going
with that story but I really really like
this pink another one I really like is
the bright red one it's in velvety
fuchsia it's just such a beautiful not
just red but it's got that kind of pink
turn to it which I'm sure is why it's
called fuchsia but I do feel like it's
not quite just fuchsia it's like right
in between and I love that about it and
I don't know that I have a shade quite
like this so I really like all of these
a lot I mean all of them are good but
these are kind of the two that I really
feel strongly about that I really really
like um for a dollar ninety-nine you
can't go wrong I mean you really can't
and especially like this is a great one
if you needed like a certain lip color
for like Halloween or something and you
know you're only gonna wear it once this
is a great one because they actually
perform really well but they're only a
dollar ninety-nine see you won't feel
bad if you don't really use it again you
know what I mean I just said you know
what I mean a lot I used to say it more
than I do but I still say it too much
okay so um so we know the price is good
the packaging I don't love because it's
that kind where you have to like not be
shaky because if you are you might get
the lipstick all over the lids you
to be like the most careful you've ever
been it's like performing surgery um so
the packaging I don't love but other I
think it's cute but obviously the lid
situation it's kind of like the wet wild
megalast once where you're like always
like nervous you're going to get it
everywhere
um the these don't really have a smell
well it's got the tiny bit of like a
plasticky smell I don't even know if I
would call it classy it's got kind of a
little bit of like a perfumed plastic
smell but it's so slight that I've never
noticed on my lips and I'm the kind of
like the Milani ones that smell like
melon I can't I had to get rid of all of
them so that bothered me but this does
so if that helps you as like a point of
reference with it how much of a smell
that has this one doesn't bother me at
all there's a pretty wide shade range I
can list right here on the screen how
many there are in the range because I
don't know off the top of my head um but
I remember sitting in the store and
thinking that I already had this and I
knew I wanted to get more and I had four
in mine and I was like that's probably
plenty but there were a lot to choose
from especially for something that's
only a dollar ninety-nine I feel like
some drugstore brands only have like six
different shades if it's this cheap
whereas this one and the wet wild
megalast they have a pretty decent range
but these are way creamier way creamier
than the mega last and you guys know I
like those wet wild ones but I also told
you guys in that video where I was
talking about it that you do have to
kind of get it going before it's
anywhere near creamy these are creamy
right off the bat so hopefully this
review and swatch video was helpful for
you guys if you are interested in more
of my lip swatch videos I do a lot of
these for drugstore lipsticks I've done
a couple elf like they're matte lip
color I've done a swatch video those
I've done some for the Revlon lipsticks
that have been around for decades and
decades like seventy years I'll link
those below as well and it might be
linked in my little cards if you see
that little eye up there if you hover
over it you'll see videos I recommend it
I think that's so cool I've been messing
around
I'm like oh this is pretty cool so now
I'm looking at the little ion like
everyone's videos and looking at the
video so they recommend anyway so
definitely subscribe if you like these
kinds of videos I do them all the time
and I'll catch you guys in my next one
