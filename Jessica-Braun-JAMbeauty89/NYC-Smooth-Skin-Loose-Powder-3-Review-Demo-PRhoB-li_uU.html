reviewing for you the NYC smooth skin
loose face powder in translucent and I
have been wearing this I bought it maybe
when did I put up that haul video maybe
a month ago when I actually got this and
I can link that haul video below because
I got a lot of amazing
cheap drugstore things that I absolutely
can't stop using but this is one of the
numb the top three things that I was
like how have I lived this long without
knowing about this this is a loose
powder and the way it's meant to be used
is - you can wear it alone if you wanted
just to kind of perfect your pores just
a little bit but mostly to kind of even
things out get rid of a little bit of
excess shine things like that I like to
use it over foundation because it does a
really great job of setting it so that
it's not going to move throughout the
day it's kind of like a barrier but it's
not only a barrier it also soaks up a
little bit of excess oil and what has
amazed me about this product is that not
only does it do that beautifully but it
serves to still let my skin breathe and
a lot of finely milled powders like this
tend to kind of they look fine when I
put it on but it's so mad that my I look
like a porcelain doll and I don't like
that look I know a lot of at least I
don't like that look on myself I know
some people look absolutely gorgeous
like that but for me I like it to look
mattified ish but just a little bit of
life in the face I'm wearing this today
and so let's go ahead and get into the
demo of how I apply this and then
afterwards I'll talk about the
nitty-gritty details of this prod so I
have taken the sifter off of mine just
because I felt that you know when I
would have that little sifter on it and
I would have to try and dump it into the
lid I always felt like it would get it
would make way more of a mess than if I
were to just have it open and then I can
dip my brush into it tap it off and I'm
not having to like dump anything so I
really like using it this way it's just
easier to use of course I can't really
travel with this cuz this just pushes on
it doesn't like screw on or anything so
I would have to maybe put it in
something else that's a little more
secure and to me
that is a big deal because I do travel
quite a bit so I would need to put this
in another thing but it is so worth it
and I just got like tweezers to get
under it and then pulled it up that way
in case you were curious but I'm just
using a brush it's from Altair Beauty I
reviewed this a long time ago it's just
a really cheap brush set but I really
like the brushes but I'm just using this
because it's big and fluffy enough but
it's not so big that it's going to get
all over my desk all over my shirt all
over the place because this can tend to
get a little bit messy so I'm just going
to dip it and get plenty on my brush and
then cap off plenty of excess and try
not to breathe it in and I'm just going
to start in my t-zone where I tend to be
the oïleus and where my makeup tends to
break apart the most and just brush it
there and you can already see that like
any of that shine is gone but it's still
you can still see that my skin is still
breathing there's a little bit of oil
left behind which I really like because
it makes me look like I'm not dead now
I'm going to do my nose as well because
it oh it gets the greasiest out of
anything so I'm first just going to tap
it on and press it in and then I'm going
to tap the rest off and then kind of
brush it so that any excess is gone and
anything extra I'm just kind of throwing
right there under my kind of on top of
my concealer in a way and I'm also going
to do anywhere that I didn't really put
a ton of product like I didn't put blush
obviously here and this can kind of help
to blend in your blush as well if you
feel that it's kind of wonky it can kind
of tend to help blur the edges of your
blush and contour which I really like
anything extra I'll just kind of dust on
the chin but I'm never too concerned
about the chin but yeah that is how I
use this product so this is about three
dollars anywhere you get it I bought
mine at Walmart and store you can buy it
on Walmart's website and in a million
other places I will link it below they
have two different shades this is the
translucent they also sell the shade
called naturally beige which is
obviously darker than this and has a
little bit of pigment to it I haven't
tried it I think it would be too dark
for my skin tone but you can look at it
and store and kind of compare but the
translucent
work for virtually any skin tone it
might look a little powdery if you've
got a really deep skin tone but if you
apply with the light hand and really
blend it in it can look absolutely
beautiful on anyone but just know that
obviously with the color like this it
could look ashy if you've got really
dark skin tone a similar product that I
tried is the elf HD powder I've also
tried some more high-end ones like the
it cosmetics one but honestly I like the
NYC one better and this is the one you
know it cosmetics is a lot more
expensive and it's nice it's there
bye-bye pores and the elf HD one is nice
as well
but the NYC one is cheaper easier to
find in my opinion and I just think that
it is better it feels like I'm using a
high-end luxurious powder when I apply
it and the way that it wears throughout
the day is absolutely amazing it just
lets your skin breathe through it so it
looks gorgeous and airbrushed almost but
it doesn't look so cakey I'm just amazed
how well this works and it doesn't have
any glitter in it or anything like that
it just whatever it is made of is just
gorgeous like I had mentioned the
packaging is not ideal which is why I
took off that sifter and I just use
tweezers but really that's kind of the
thing you face with all of these kinds
of things they all have sifters and so
then you dump it then it gets so that's
just the nature of loose powder I will
say I like using loose powder better
than like powder foundations or just
mattifying powders because I noticed
that they make my skin look a little bit
more normal it doesn't look so cakey in
it you'd think that a loose powder would
look more cakey but it doesn't it looks
it just seamlessly blends into the skin
a way most people would apply I know
that in my makeup classes I've taken a
lot of people use a big thick powder
puff and you roll it into your skin
which really is probably the more ideal
way but honestly it's easier for me to
use a brush and I like the way it looks
better in person
when I use a brush rather than like a
thick velour powder puff I think a
powder puff is maybe more ideal if
you're doing stage work or film work but
I think for every day I'd rather use a
brush overall what I recommend it
absolutely it's three bucks you could
buy it try
and if you hate it pass it on to someone
else that might like it but I really
think that you will absolutely love this
product as much as I do hopefully this
review is helpful for you guys if you
are interested in my many other
drugstore review and demo videos I will
link the entire playlist below if you
