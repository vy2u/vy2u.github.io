airport and my lovely hubby
Tyler is driving me to go to New York
City and if you have caught my snapchat
I was snapping about it last night just
how thankful I am the only reason I'm
going to New York is with elf cosmetics
and the only reason they Know Who I am
is because of you guys so I am so
excited thank you guys so much and so I
don't really know what to expect from
this trip they've been really hush-hush
about exactly what's gonna be going on
and what we're doing but I'm excited I'm
excited about the hotel I'm staying in
it's called the Beekman and it's like
kind of historical and like they just
redid it and it's from like that did
they say 1800s I'll have to look it up
and look up the history but I'm so
excited so tonight we have like a
cocktail party and then tomorrow is a
big ole day of question marks I don't
really know what we're doing but I'm
excited and I'm excited I don't know if
other youtubers are gonna be there like
I have no idea what to expect so I'm
excited to meet some new people as well
it's like 10:00 a.m. right now my flight
leaves around 12:00 I think we start
flirting a little bit earlier and I'm
really proud of myself because let me
show you I have managed to pack all of
the things I need in this one Rebecca
Minkoff back and I'm so proud of that
and then I just have like my regular
crossbody purse usually I have just a
little bit more than this
and I'm just so glad I didn't have to
bring a huge suitcase to lug around New
York City so I'm so proud to New York
welcome to New York it's been waiting
for you know I knew there's a billion
New York subway or what's the other one
I said leaden instead of leaving so I
made it to the airport and I'm thinking
I'm not gonna have any time to eat
anything before I or once I land in
LaGuardia so I think I'm gonna get
something to eat here even though I'm
not starving just because I know I'll be
really really hungry and I have to rush
to the hotel once I get there for I
don't know who are meeting up I don't
really know like I told you that I've
got so many questions so just flying by
the seat of my pants
so I made it to the guardia now I'm
headed to catch an uber and then head to
the hotel and meet up with everyone I'm
so excited I finally made it and this
place is amazing it's so historic and so
let me just show you a little bit of the
room so there's this giant mirror and
then just I love all the wood and then
the minibar is so cute it's so I don't
know like if it was restored it looks
like it was maybe created for this to
kind of look you know the style I don't
know but it is beautiful and then alpha
left a little present and that was so
sweet I haven't opened it yet but I'm so
excited but the view is not too bad
either
folks so I've got about 25 minutes to
change and glam myself up and just
refresh but I think we're supposed to
meet in the lobby because we're supposed
to take a tour of the YouTube
headquarters okay I am off I think I
look cocktail enough that sounded weird
you know what I mean it's a cocktail
party I think I look all right okay so
we are waiting in the lobby of the
ridiculously beautiful hotel The Beacon
and I'm here with a I just subscribed to
her channel she is lovely so far Anthony

and I'm like I do I do
that's so awesome we were talking about
how like when you meet someone that
you've met on YouTube how it feels like
you have known them forever ever and
like you just feel comfortable talking
to him because you're like yeah awesome

eaten more of but I didn't so I'm like
looking in a room service right now cuz
I'm like ravenous but beyond that I got
a special note today and that would be
from ELF so it looks as though tomorrow
I am going to the New York Stock
Exchange which they announced at the
party and we are so excited if we
haven't mentioned that earlier in the
vlog because elf becomes a publicly
traded company tomorrow so that is going
to be unfreaking believable and then
we're gonna have lunch and then we're
gonna have and this is news to me
ain't helicopter rocked over Manhattan
and then we're gonna privately shop at
the L flagship store I have never done
any of this and I am so excited you're
gonna get tired of me saying I'm so
excited but I can't help it I am and
it's none of this seems real and also

morning we have to be ready to go by
like 7:45 but there's continental
breakfast downstairs so I don't want to
miss that so I'm trying to get ready
quickly but I wanted to show you guys
the view in the morning isn't this so
beautiful
is it bad that every time I'm in New
York I always think of home alone to
like always
that's just what like I think in New
York I'm like yeah home own too so part
of me wants to listen like home alone
Christmas music while I'm getting ready
even though it is not Christmas anywho
so I need to go get ready
good morning yeah I just told them I'm
gonna vlog for a second then I was like
I don't need to explain myself to you
guys cuz uh they know so I got a
frittata like everyone else and it is
crazy good I'm not sure what's in it
it's really good and it feels early and
we're all just now getting coffee so
starting to feel like a human again a
lot of us drank a good amount last night
we are on our way you're getting on you
going
the bus again I think it's the same
swanky bus we were on last night we are
going to the stock exchange this morning
and I'm so excited I can't stop saying
how excited a
so this has been awesome we got nametags
which is just cool and they're like
legit they're not even like it's too
legit to quit but it's just so cool it's
surreal
so we are on the floor here and it's so
much quieter than I thought it would be
so I just got pulled to the side to get
some pictures in front of the digital
walls elf had because I was in the video
there which is so cool
so I'm luckily didn't get lost and I've
got to find my way to where the rest of
us are I think I can find my way this is
just so exciting like Elvis everywhere
it's so exciting for them
so what did you think it was crazy there
that's where they make the money they
make that money it was so cool it was so
cool and just like a lot of standing
around yeah you know we had no job there
were just there
whoa that Sun is bright showing all my
flaws so we are oh my gosh it's so
bright we're gonna go get pizza we're
really excited
we just say pizza and I feel like a new
person so we are headed to our
helicopter ride in the sky I'm so
excited
again I don't really know what to expect
I don't think I've ever been on a
helicopter before so I'm really really
excited guys just look at this
where it is
I own a lot of elf but I am quite
excited to pick some things out some
things that honestly I didn't even
really know it just sit for colors I've
never thought about that
people here have told me about so I'm
really excited I promise I'll show you
what I got

drink because I've got like an hour
after you because we can I have to get
up really early tomorrow to teach the
children that's the truth
well yeah I have to make good on you
mark but the reality is it's 4:45 like
for fun because I'm not too concerned so
we stopped at a place to grab a bite to
eat maybe in a drink before the airport
and I asked for the restaurant is and
I'm like in a dungeon
so I am sad to leave and I just said
goodbye to Gita and Carol but I'm
waiting on my goober and we are headed
to LaGuardia because I do have to go and

and I'm really missing my doggie and I'm
missing my husband so I am excited to be
home in a couple hours and then I've got
to teach in the morning

so much ridiculous traffic just getting
here it was like not in the city just
the ramp to get to this terminal so
