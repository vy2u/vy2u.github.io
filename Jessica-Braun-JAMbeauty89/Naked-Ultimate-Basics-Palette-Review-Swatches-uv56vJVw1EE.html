going to do a review and some swatches
of the new Urban Decay Naked ultimate
basics palette this palette is $54 when
it comes out of my mouth I feel like
that is way too much money for an
eyeshadow palette but boy I get suckered
in every time here's the thing the Urban
Decay Naked palette are they started at
50 then there were 52 I think right now
they're 54 like this is I have the Naked
palette 1 and 2 I have about three I
haven't bought smokey I've owned the
Naked basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 I've decluttered one
like my might I've got a storied past
with urban decay naked palettes I have
across the board been very impressed
it's not that the shadows are
unimpressive they're amazing but it's
kind of more of it you know is it worth
that much money like the wet and wild
palettes are amazing the elf palettes
are amazing is it worth 50 dollars when
I can get a really good palette for
under $10 that's kind of the crux of my
problem with all of it now I love
drugstore makeup I should I should start
there if you're new to my channel that's
my that's my ground that's my face but I
also really like high-end palettes that
I've tried so it's not that I'm not
experienced in either one it's just that
you know isn't really worth $54 that's a
lot of money when I start breaking down
the hour by hour like I'm a teacher when
I start baking down how much I make is a
teacher I'm like was that worth like
three or four hours of working no it was
not if you do that you know what I mean
if you don't do that yet don't start
because you're gonna get really
depressed when you realize how much
money you spend on things and then you
start thinking about how many hours that
I need to work to buy that and then
you're like wow that was not worth it so
maybe it's a good thing anyway besides
the point um let's go through the pros
and cons of this palette first Pro it is
the most beautiful packaging I've like
ever seen it's plastic so don't get it
twisted its plastic whereas like the
naked 2 I love that that's metal I
really do like that this is plastic
which I don't hate because it doesn't
really show your fingerprints on the
front it's gorgeous
I mean they know like I mentioned in the
hole where I hold this and like a ton of
other products I can link it below it
was like hundred
rids of dollars with a makeup that I
hauled I was really excited to show them
to you guys but I'm excited to review a
bunch of them so packaging a plus
absolute a plus I love that it's no
nonsense it's a huge mirror which for me
I travel all the time with the husband
being a travel agent it's got 12
different eyeshadows beautiful
eyeshadows the brush that comes with it
is alright like it's always a synthetic
this one's a dual ended one I've used it
like I've used the the smaller side for
like liner just kind of under the lash
line the top one I've used to pack on a
shadow there alright it's not I don't I
just don't love synthetic brushes like
this so for me it's not really in my
taste but it's not a bad brush it's just
not my favorite but besides the point
we're not really paying fifty four
dollars for the brush are we so you get
these top like five shades they're six
shades in each row the top five on the
left are all kind of really similar or I
should say the top like four on the left
then the next two up there are kind of
these more Mavi tones so there's like a
classic mauve and then there's this
deeper one called lethal that's like a
deep plum I'm wearing some of this on my
eyes today
and then you've got pregame on the
bottom left which is the nice like
yellow matte and then there's all these
colors here so there's like an orangish
one called extra bitter then faith and
lockout in the middle bottom are kind of
both really really similar they look the
same on the eyes and then you've got
magnet which is like a matte darker blue
and then you've got black jack I almost
said blackout it's called Black Jack and
it's a matte black they're all matte
which I like I mean that's the idea it's
the ultimate basic so if you're
ultimately basic now that sounds mean I
am a total neutral girl so I should let
you know right away that I love neutral
matte shadows but I also like a little
bit of shimmer so for me this is not a
one-stop shop but if you love mattes it
is a total one-stop shop it's got tons
but I will say I feel like quite a few
of the shadows are the same so I feel
like you could totally get away with you
know nude commando and tempted they're
in the top row they look the same
on the ice they swatch a tiny bit
differently but when you're putting them
whether it's on your lid or you're
blending under your brow bone they look
the same there's no difference
same with faith and lockout there's a
slight slight difference in the swatch
but they look the same on the eyes so
whereas everything else kind of is a
little different there is a little bit
of a satin look to this shade below here
it's got a tiny satin shift I use it on
my brow bone the other shades I used
I've been using instinct a lot it's that
Mavi shade just kind of blend into my
crease I use lethal on the outer corner
today um let's see what else did I
actually use today black out I didn't
use today but I'm using I've been using
that a lot on my lower lash line if I
want kind of a darker look to it I've
even used it to kind of line or tight
line my upper lash line but I like it
it's not that I'm not getting a ton of
use but it's kind of one of those things
where if you already have palettes that
have matte shades you don't need this
you just don't the other thing I would
say is that if you already have the
Naked basics palette those cover a lot
of these so like I used to have the
Naked basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 I ended up only
keeping the two which actually I think
I've declutter it and sensory bought
because I ended up missing it this one
has a little bit of differentiation when
it comes to the shades I sound like a
teacher if you're a teacher you're gonna
be like yes differentiation yes anyway
um but again it's got some similar
shades where like these two on this side
are very very similar like do you need
both maybe not
um but I do love these again these two
very very similar but it's kind of that
gradient where it's just slightly
lighter but it can be really perfect if
you're really trying to do a true
amazingly perfect makeup look because
you do have those gradients when it
comes to blending so it just depends on
your preference so thinking of the price
point because I think that's what stops
a lot of people it's what kind of
stopped me and made me think and then I
still bought it but the price point I
think is what stops most people because
I thought of money for the same price
you can get the Naked palette which if
you don't have yet this has way more
diversity and I really mean like you can
do all
most anything with this palette it has
one - only two matte shades though so if
you know you're into mattes this would
not be your favorite palette I mean it's
mostly shimmer that's true for most of
the naked palettes but this one I think
out of all of their palettes has the
most diversity and that's why it was the
original so one I would recommend more
than anything over any of the Urban
Decay palettes The Naked 2 for a while I
thought I liked better until I realized
I just didn't I wasn't reaching for it
it does have this amazing matte black
just like the naked ultimate basics does
but again it's got a lot of shimmers it
has one two three including that black
one three matte shadows but again lots
of shimmer just a little bit of change
from the original Naked palette let me
hold them up next to each other trying
to hold the brushes in at the same time
okay here we go so the top one is the
original one and then the Naked 2 you
can see how the original one just right
off the bat has tons more options than
the other one they're both amazing I
would say the original naked is a little
warmer but it also still has cool tones
this one's the Naked 2 has a lot more
cooler tones but again for the same
price you can get these which I think in
my opinion are more versatile bottom
line if you like matte shadows you will
love this if you know you never ever
wear shimmer shadows and this is right
up your alley then it's worth the $54
because they are amazing shadows and
there's like though it runs the gamut of
the shades that they have however if you
know you like to mix it up I would say
if you don't own any of the original
naked palettes you should maybe invest
in that because it does have some matte
shadows but it also has those different
various shimmer shadows that kind of
complement those looks so it really does
depend on your preference I think it's a
nice palette but I don't think it's for
everyone so hopefully this video was
helpful for you guys I'll link all the
palettes that I mentioned down below if
you're interested in any of them other
than that I hope that you'll subscribe
