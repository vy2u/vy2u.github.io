Vitacost haul for you now I kind of went
crazy and I've been so blessed because
of all of you guys that have clicked on
my vitacost link and you've saved
yourself $10 I told you it also gives me
$10 to spend so I looked on there and I
had enough credit to place in order for
all kinds of things that I've been
wanting to try out and perhaps review
here on my channel so thank you guys for
those that have clicked the link because
I am so excited to show you the things
that I picked out so let's start with
the makeup because I know that's why
most of you guys are subscribed to me so
one of the first two things I picked up
were these lip glosses and if you don't
know Vitacost is more of a natural
organic type of website so even their
makeup products that they sell are more
natural so I got this eco bella brand of
lip gloss and I got two different shades
I got piece here which is just a really
nice nude peachy color and it has just a
little bit of shimmer and I really I
love the way that it looks on my lips
every single day you guys know that I'm
a teacher and I need just normal lip
colors for every day so this is one that
I've had in my purse a lot lately and
the other shade that I got is called
pleasure and it's this really pretty
kind of the color of my shirt here
almost like a lilac pink shade and again
it has that same type of shimmer in it I
love the packaging of these I think it's
so cute that it's got the gold rim and I
don't know there's something about them
they're just a little bit different than
any other lip gloss that I've had for a
while so I really like them by the way
if you're gonna ask on my lips is the
NYX butter lipstick that I gotten what
an Ipsy bag and it's in the shade hunk I
really like it alright so I also got
some of the everyday minerals products
this is it's the same idea of bare
minerals where they've got finely milled
powders that you use for all different
things on your face so I got three face
products and then a concealer and I want
to start with that I'm wearing it today
this is the everyday minerals
multitasking mineral concealer now this
is similar to like the bare minerals
well rested except for this isn't as
hello as that one is this is a lot more
it's just lighter than that and not as
yellow tinted but it is very it just
really is brightening and you can see
even just on my hand I am so fair and
yet that is a lot brighter and lighter
than my skin which is so hard for me to
find because I am so fair but I love
putting on a normal concealer any
concealer and then using a small brush
to just apply this to that area and I
really do feel like it brightens it it
holds it in its place it's so good I've
been reaching for this more than
anything the past couple of weeks the
other things I got from everyday
minerals I got their base which is their
mineral foundation so it's everyday
minerals Basin I got it in Rosie Fair
which is zero C they have matte basis
which this is and I think they have like
satin bases as well if you want it to be
a little more dewy I think it's called
satin but I got I think this is the
lightest shade it might be a little too
light for me but then again it might be
perfect I haven't used this yet so I'm
not really sure but the other two I have
used I got their everyday minerals face
which are just kind of their face
powders that aren't necessarily
foundations but you use them on your
face and this is their finishing dust
finishing powder and that's I guess
finishing dust is like the name of the
shade too and it's a lot closer to my
skin tone but I use this to just kind of
set my t-zone if it's oily you can press
it into your skin anywhere you could use
this under your eyes as well if you
wanted I really like it it reminds me of
my NYC one that I have been loving I
feel like it just blends away it's a
little more translucent than colored but
it does have a little bit of color so if
you know this isn't gonna work for you
then it won't I also got the everyday
minerals cheek so this is one of their
blushes and it's in the shade Primrose
whoa and it's a really pretty simple
pink color it's got its I would say it's
a satin finish it doesn't have like a
glowy finish I'm wearing it on my cheeks
today and you can see the color I have a
hard candy highlighter on top of it but
it's just a really simple everyday pink
color it reminds me of Mac's well
dressed I think
or even Dame but again just a really
nice peachy color you can really build
it up if you want a lot of color but I
just love it you can't really go wrong
with it I want to try a few I only saw a
few shades on Vitacost Aziz but I really
I think if I were recommending one of
these things however it would probably
be the concealer because I think it is
so amazing and it's small you can throw
it in your purse or your makeup bag and
you can know throughout the day you
could touch up with this instead of
having to get a brush I mean you can
even just use your finger I love it so
moving on from there I got a lot of
other beauty related items so one thing
I picked up from there I was surprised
to see this on there is the Rusk
weightless hairspray
now I actually need some hairspray today
I'm letting my hair air dry and my hair
is naturally like wavy curly you guys
have seen it but that looks the way that
it has in my past videos because I've
diffused it with the blow-dryer and
stuff but when I just let it air dry
it's just kind of limp and wavy that has
nothing to do with this anyway but I
have never tried this but I've heard
really good things about this hairspray
and so I was like well I want to try it
so I was surprised I've never thought of
Rusk is a natural brain and frankly I
don't know that it necessarily is I also
picked up one of my favorites the EOS
lip balm and sweet mint you guys know
that this I don't this is what I'll say
about cos arias whatever I don't like
any other AOS other than the mint ones
I've tried I swear like all of them I've
tried the coconut milk ones and I used
them up I finished them because they
always smell good but this one for me
actually like hydrates my lips and it's
so easy because a lot of my other lip
balms that I love are in pots so I've
got to take the time to open it which
are sometimes hard to open then I got to
get my fingers all greasy and get it on
and my hands might not be clean whereas
this I can just grab it throw it on I
have like two of these in my classroom
one of my nights and one of my purse one
in my makeup I have them everywhere so I
actually ordered a few of these but
figured I don't need to show you all but
I love them alright next I got this all
I was really excited to try this this is
the will later
skin food for dry and rough skin and
it's I'll show it to you I've used it
already
I put it back in the box so I could show
it to you and it's got one of those kind
of like thick metal type squeezy tubes
which I think are just kind of fun I
don't know why and it just says for dry
and rough skin such as hands feet elbows
apply several times a day with the
gentle massage as if I needed to read
those directions but it's just kind of a
light yellowish cream but it's very very
thick and emollient and it's just it's
it's as if it's medicine for dry skin
that's what it feels like they also sell
small versions of this like if you
wanted to try it out before you just bit
the bullet and bought it there's a lot
of alliteration if you just bit the
bullet and bought it but they have a
smaller version of these that I actually
bought smaller versions of this for my
bridesmaids gifts I'm putting them
together right now and I'm so excited
about them so if you are one of my
bridesmaids and you're watching this
stop because there's spoilers regardless
I love this and it smells like okay this
is gonna be very specific and probably
only two of you will know there's this
board game called cranium and in that
game there's this purple like play-doh
like substance that you're supposed to
build stuff out up for part of the game
and that purple play-doh smells like
this it's a good smell I love that smell
it's like I want to say citrusy in a way
but not completely I don't know how to
describe it to yonce with you guys I
love the smell of it though it's all I
know
alright so the next thing I'm so excited
about all of these things okay a lot of
this I had done a lot of research online
but also I watch a lot of YouTube that
YouTube friends of mine do their hauls
and I was like okay
totally wanting to get that because it's
really hard to start from scratch with
like natural stuff because a lot of it
I've never ever ever ever heard of but I
trust a lot of the people i watch on
here well frankly I don't watch anyone
that I don't trust so I'm I took a lot
of advice from a lot of videos so this
is kind of an amalgamation of other
people's best of the best and I'm gonna
see how I like them this is the angelou
naturals pumpkin honey glycolic Mass and
I really don't ever do masks and when I
say I don't ever I
I never ever do maths because in the
past when I've done them they either dry
my skin out too much or it just never
seems to do good for my skin and I think
looking back that all the masks I'd
tried maybe just wore terrible masks so
now that I'm a little bit wiser I'm
really excited to give this a try I
haven't tried it yet it comes with like
a little it looks like baby food to be
honest it smells like pumpkin and honey
but it doesn't smell like fake fragrance
I pray that there is not fake fragrance
in this so anyway it says organic
pumpkin rich in beta-carotene blended
with manuka honey and citrus glycolic
ASA's it does awesome lifts away dull
surface cells exfoliating and
resurfacing for even tone and smooth
texture more luminous complexion blah
blah blah so I'm excited to give this a
shot this is a lot cheaper than some of
the masks that are out there that are so
expensive so expensive so I'm excited I
will let you guys know how I feel about
a lot of the skincare because I know I
get a lot of skincare questions and you
know even just when I find that's
something that I love I find another
thing that I love even more that's even
better for my skin so I'm I'm slowly
narrowing it down to like the ultimate
skincare regimen okay another thing I
got speaking of skincare is this a cure
brightening facial scrub and it's the
Argan stem cell and chlorella growth
factor all skin types and it says 85% of
people saw a decrease in pigmentation
and that's nice because if you've seen
any of my demos and tutorials when I'm
reviewing products I do have you know
little bits of hyperpigmentation on my
cheeks that drive me nuts so I'm excited
to give this a try the only exfoliating
that I do on my face is never with beads
it's actually like I think it's mine an
A or a BHA I don't know I think it's a
PHA but it's basically almost like a
cream that you put on and then you rinse
off in the morning it just kind of sinks
into your skin does its work chemically
and then you rinse it off in the morning
and I really really like that so I also
bought that from Vitacost but I'm
excited to give this a shot too I heard
really good things so the next a thing
is this oh yeah okay one of my favorite
brands is dr. Bronner's what I use to
clean my brushes with is this giant
bottle of doctor
honors like soap that you mix with water
and it lasts forever actually really
interesting to read about the way this
company where the way it started dr.
Bronner and his story is so bizarre and
interesting but this is their organic
shaving gel and lavender and I always
use like a spray like poofy shaving
cream but I used to use more like true
creams and lotions so I'm excited to
give this a shot I don't know I don't
know I've never tried it but I am I'm
almost out of the one I'm using now and
summers coming so I'm trying to make
sure my legs are nice and moisturize
blah blah blah my wedding just coming up
that I can't wait alright so the last
few things that I got are some teas I
bought like a million of the Tazo Zen
tea because it is cheaper on the site
and Tyler loves it I love it I have
boxes of this in my classroom Tazo Zen
tea is my favorite tea ever I have never
gone through so many boxes in my life I
don't and I don't it just makes me feel
good and again it totally might be a
placebo effect but I love the way it
tastes and now like I associate this
taste with like being relaxed and me
being happy so it's like an amalgamation
of all of those things and I love this
so much you can get this at regular
stores anywhere too so don't feel like
you have to go on fight across you can
get this anywhere a lot of this you can
get it a lot of different like I've seen
a lot of these brands at Whole Foods
have I seen any at Trader Joe's I don't
know having been at Trader Joe's in a
while if you have like a fresh time near
you I don't know how widespread that is
those have these natural brands I mean
anywhere like that I also try out a new
brand a new type this is the traditional
medicinals relaxation tea and it's there
at 99 tea and I do like to drink tea at
night when I'm reading a book which
right now I'm reading Water for
Elephants and I haven't I haven't seen
the movie but I've had the book for a
while and I'm wanting to read through my
all the books that I keep buying at
half-price books that I then never read
I'm reading through them so I'm reading
that one right now I'm not sure how I
feel about it but I like to drink tea
with that story's pointless I like to
drink tea when I'm relaxing at night so
I'm excited because Zen tea even though
I love it it does have some caffeine in
it so even though it's relaxing it's not
necessary
like a sleepy time tea even though I
totally drink it at night too sometimes
regardless I will let you guys know how
I like this so that was everything that
I got I had so much fun on their side
they have so many new things and I feel
like every time I get on there I'm like
oh I had no idea they sold this brand oh
I had no idea to sold this brand so let
me know if you have any vitacost
favorites especially when it comes to
skincare tea makeup
anything like that I'm always interested
to try new things and I feel like I'm
placing an order on Vitacost like every
couple of months even Tyler I didn't
have his stuff but he had a whole other
box of things that he got some like
workout things some different what else
did we get Oh like the PB to peanut
butter that you can put in smoothies we
both got some of that and just all kinds
of stuff that we get from there but let
me know what you like on the site
because again I'm always interested in
trying new things from there because
it's all still new to me and hopefully
that was enjoyable and I'll catch you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
