going to share with you guys how I get
my hair like this now this is a
hairstyle that will work best on hair
that's already naturally wavy / curly I
always tell you right away when a video
is sponsored and this one is sponsored
by E salon and I've been trying their
products for a while and I have loved
them I actually have favorite products
of theirs for when I wear my hair like
kind of straight with a little wave at
the bottom like I do a lot but I also
have products that I love from them when
I do my hair like this I have a 50% off
link for all of the products I'm gonna
mention and they also have a deal where
it's like you can get any three products
for $15 which is a really good deal
because these are all around 15 this one
is 14 and the other two or 15 so
definitely look below if you actually
want to buy some of these they are way
better deals down there anyway this is
their defining hair cream and I use this
first in the tutorial that I'm going to
show you and the second product I use is
their above the clouds volumizing mousse
and this stuff is awesome and then I
also use their never let go firm hold
hairspray so if you're curious about how
I achieve this look just keep watching
so I'm gonna show you how to take your
hair from kind of wet and Ola to
something much better so the first
product we're gonna be using is the e
salon define and lovely defining hair
cream and I'm just gonna score some of
this into the palm of my hand and just
kind of rub it together
and then work it through my hair like
you see me doing here I'm just kind of
trying to get it especially on the ends
there and then just working it back
towards the scalp and spreading it out
evenly and the next product that we'll
be using is the above the clouds
volumizing mousse and this you need to
shrink and then I got a little latte in
there and just again rubbing it together
but this time working it through in the
motion I'm using or I'm kind of pushing
it up towards my scalp and this kind of
starts to form the curls and this is one
of the main keys to I think getting this
look really volumize and so I'm going to
get just a little bit more
work it through the rest of my hair some
parts that I missed and just making sure
that I'm evenly working out that little
glob that's right there in my hair that
I keep seeing and the next product is
there never let go firm hold hairspray
and this I'm just gonna spray all over
my hair and then kind of work it back
through the same way I was doing the
mousse so once I've done guest just kind
of pushing up towards my scalp again
forming those curls and getting them to
stay in the shape I want them to be in
and then the key is a hairdryer with a
diffuser and this it doesn't matter what
brand but just working it up as you see
me doing again towards my scalp because
this is gonna make it look really
volumize just really helping to define
those curls at first I do it with the
highest heat setting but towards the end
I switch to cool so that way it kind of
closes the hair cuticle if you will and
just making it look like this right now
and lastly we're gonna use some of the
never let go hairspray again just to
kind of seal in the style and the shape
it really does hold on to it really well
throughout the day so that is gonna
complete your lips and just fluff it out
so this is the completed look now of
course I've got makeup on as well but
that always helps doesn't it so I love
these products what I love about each of
them is that none of them make my hair
feel like crunchy I've tried so many
products that you know I've been doing
my hair like this since I was like in
middle school and so many products that
are out there make my hair feel really
crunchy or it just makes it sticky and
this is like touchably soft even my
husband will say I really he loves when
I were ever hair like this more than
anything but you know it's touchably
soft it's not crunchy the hair cream the
defining hair cream I really like to
pair with the mousse and I've figured
out that with hair like this it works
best to have both because the cream kind
of holds them together and then the
mousse just gives it that volume I think
one without the other doesn't work as
well and then the
Hair Spray of course just to hold it in
place for the rest of the day I just
love all three of these together it
gives my hair this volume it's not super
frizzy so hopefully this video was
helpful and informative for you guys and
again the 50% off links are down below
as well as that 3/4 15 dollar deal other
than that I hope that you'll subscribe
for more of my videos and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
