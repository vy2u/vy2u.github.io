going to be sharing with you a drugstore
haul so I've got a lot of different
brands and different kinds of drug store
items that I've recently picked up its
kind of collective over the past I would
say month it's not even longer but one
in particular a brand I've never tried
is mua which is makeup Academy which is
available in the UK or it has been for a
while but it's just now becoming more
readily available here in the United
States so I picked up a few things from
there just to kind of get a feel and let
you guys know so I'll definitely include
swatches of these things and talk about
kind of the where time etc so if you're
interested just keep watching alright so
let's go ahead and start with the MUA
items because I'm really really excited
to share them with you guys so we'll
start with the main thing that I'm
wearing that I have a lot of feelings
about this is the MUA I don't know what
it's called I'll list it right here it's
some sort of like liquid lipstick or
like a matte dry liquid product and it's
in the shade number 202 rose and I'm
wearing out my lips today it does dry
completely down completely matte it um
the brush I don't love it's one of those
kind of it's like a true brush it's not
a doe foot applicator the color is
gorgeous like I said it doesn't transfer
at all i was just kissing my husband
Tyler cuz he always focuses the camera
for me and then leave so I can film so I
gave me kiss and he tried to kiss me
here I'm like no you can actually kiss
me on my lips it's not gonna come off
he's like whoa like it really is good at
that but the brush kind of because of
the brush like some of the bristles on
it are like a mess so that it was
getting us on my lip line my gosh and
then on top of that it dries so quickly
which is great but it's so dry you guys
it is the driest formula I've ever tried
like literally instantly
inside of my lips were like beat it up
with dryness it was so gross and my lips
aren't chapped right now they're not dry
so there's not really a reason for it
other than it's just the formula so that
really disappointed me enough that I
think also wear this every so often
because I do like the collar at least as
I'm getting used to it but I will not
purchase another color in this in this
range because it's I'm not I'm not
impress impress as I hope to be with
that but sorry to end on a negative note
because a lot of the other stuff is
amazing so one of my favorite things
from any way is this eyeshadow palette
it is called their nude eyeshadow
palette simple simple name it says
exactly what it is and it's got ten
different shades and they are right up
my alley I love this so much it reminds
me of the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral
palette in a way but I like this even
better they're all really really
pigmented but not so much that you can't
work with them like I feel like with
some pallets even high-end palettes that
I love they can be difficult to work
with because they're so pigmented that
you're almost like okay what do I even
do with that you know what I mean but
these they blend pretty well together
and wearing them on my eyes today I know
the Lighting's kind of watch me out a
bit but um I'm wearing them today and I
love using them is this my favorite
palette in the world like over my lorac
Pro palette that is just one of my loves
no but is it amazing for the drugstore
price and what I still recommended no
matter what yes because like i said the
color payoffs beautiful it's a good
range they have i think two other
palettes available here I no one's more
colorful maybe it's only one other um I
know if you're interested Tati from glam
life guru has talked about a lot of
these mua palettes as well and um she's
down to some swatching I think maybe
than tutorials I don't know and she's
used the brighter palette so but I
really love this neutral one and if
you're like me a neutral girl I think
you'll really like it so I also got some
other mua products for lips because I
wanted to kind of get an idea because
lips are kind of what I'm really really
really into right now so this is a lip
gloss they have again they don't have
the name of it of the
Jacqueline I'll list it there it's a
number 110 bear and it just is this nude
lip gloss with a doe foot applicator
which I like but it actually packed some
color it is a true gloss it's not like a
you know a matte lipstick like this but
it actually has some color and it's got
that kind of noon almost peachy color so
I've really been liking it lately it's
great at toning down really bright
colors or dark colors but it's also
beautiful on its own so I really like
this though there's not really a smell I
don't think at all but i like the shade
a lot and it's pretty comfortable on the
lips so that is what i would recommend i
also got one of their lipsticks just
there anyway lipsticks in number 251
mauve and I mean it's really really
creamy it's a really really pretty color
they're really pigmented I was so
impressed now I've only worn this once
because i did get these recently so i
don't know about where timewise like if
it slides out your lip line because it
is really creamy i wonder if it would
fly out like the corners of your mouth
and for me like I swear like I like
collect saliva when I talk I don't know
what's wrong with me so for me like that
is a problem that when lipstick runs in
the corners of my lips or outside the
corners this is such a pretty color I do
want to try maybe some more neutral ones
in this range cuz it's such just love
that the last no I got two more mua
items and then a bunch of other stuff
this is their professional no crease
eyeshadow base this is amazing this is
like concealer for your eyelids it's
amazing now it's got it's just a squeezy
tube and it's a noon color so if you're
a deeper skin gal I I don't know if it
will work for everyone that's what I'll
say which seems to be a trend anyway
unfortunately but it really it conceals
if you've got a similar skin tone it
completely conceals the area which is
awesome and it makes your brow stand out
even more especially if you get it right
up under there and it holds onto shadow
now it is
what I like about it is it's not super
tacky like some of them are but it's not
really really too creamy either it's
right in between so I love that I love
it I am I was so impressed with this
this is one that when I run out of it
and I will I will repurchase because I
already love it that much the last time
you ate item I picked up is there
intense color gel eyeliner i got it in
black i am very impressed i've been
wearing this like crazy it is very very
black stays put all day it's gel like in
its formula which I love and I'll even
use it to go on my upper lash line kind
of tight line but even more on like my
waterline and it doesn't transfer down
below I love it so much I kind of want
to get I think they have a brown in the
line and I want to get that as well
because i like to use brown on my lower
lashline very impressed with this and
it's so wonderful when you can find a
drugstore liner that works this well
because I mean liner is something I go
through very quickly especially black
liner so I'm so excited about that fine
alright so i bought another lip product
this is from l'oreal and it's there they
don't have it named either I'm sorry
guys I'm like the worst of this video
but it's their line of like kind of lip
gloss e stains they're supposed to be
reminiscent in my opinion of the Wyatts
el la see stains because they're kind of
a gloss that they're a little bit of a
different formula almost gel like this
one's in Rose melody and it's a really
pretty color I think it's right there
it's kind of light but it's got a little
bit of that peachy rose almost and it's
really comfortable to wear they're not
the exact same as the YSL ones i
compared them but they do stay put for
quite a while I don't think there is
moisturizing as the YSL there it's such
an odd formula anyway so you almost have
to get used to it I remember owning one
of these quite a while ago and hating it
but now that I tried the YSL what I want
ok I get what it's supposed to be like
that it's supposed to stain and it kind
of feels weird but it doesn't move and
no matter what it feels like it looks
really good so it's very odd so I'm
still getting used to this as well I'm
tempted to try other shades in the range
but we'll see how I
fares with this one first um so I bought
this Maybelline the falsies push-up
drama and I was very unimpressed when I
first put it on I was like whoa like my
last just looked amazing but after a few
minutes they ended up flattening out so
I hate it I've used it a couple days I
mentioned this in mind my October
favorites and flops as well as a big
flop for me and I was so sad because I
was ready to love it and it looked
amazing at first and then it was just
that I tried it every single day the
same thing happens so I'm like you know
it's not worth it there plenty of other
mascaras I really like so the last two
things I picked up were two different
foundations this one is the covergirl
outlast stay fabulous and this is one
that I have I might have even gotten rid
of because the shape is just way too
light for me and I realized lately that
I have a much more yellow skin tone than
I thought so to match my skin to my like
neck and everywhere else I need to be
more cognizant of that so I actually got
a much darker shade that I would have
thought I needed this is in 8 42 which
is medium beige but I it matches my skin
it matches my neck and I think it's
because it's more of a yellow tone and
as I blend it out it's not as dark as
you would think so I've been very
impressed this color is so much more
correct for me but the formula is nice I
think it actually stays put pretty well
especially comparison to the next
foundation which is this Ready Set
gorgeous by covergirl I had heard so
many people say they love this stuff and
I saw it and they was buy one get one
half off and that's why I got both and I
wasn't okay I'm just gonna do it so i
got the shade to 10 which again is more
yellowy and it's a pretty good match but
it oxidized within hours now i haven't
tried it with a primer yet since I just
got these but I am in and try to the
primer I wore just on its own which is
what I do with most foundations anyway
but my skin I mean any of my
hyperpigmentation and freckles just came
right through and it just did not look
good by the end
I would say by a couple hours into the
day so I definitely need to wear this
with the primer and see how it works but
so far not loving it but I want to
definitely give it a try since I know so
many people do love it so let me know
below if you do if you are one of those
people that love this what primary are
you using with it because I'm so curious
and I want to love it as well I mean I
spend my money on so I want to like it
um so those were all of the new items
I'm trying out right now I get tons of
different things sent to me from
companies I don't only show them a lot
of them are higher end ones and since I
love drugstore and that is what my
channels rooted in and what I love I
don't always like to show all of that
but if you are interested let me know
because I'm thinking about doing maybe
like every few months like a I don't
know what to call like products that
companies have sent me or um you know
that way I can show them to you guys let
you know kind of my initial thoughts on
them or so you can see what's out there
but I don't want that to like take over
my channel so let me know what your
ideas are because I need some some
inspiration when it comes to that it
might be a very new kind of a video but
I'm interested to maybe try so let me
know your guys's thoughts don't worry
I'm not leaving the drugstore the dust
that's never gonna happen so don't you
worry your cute little face all right so
I'm gonna leave you guys alone oh so
this turned into a longer video than I
envisioned which happens all the time oh
