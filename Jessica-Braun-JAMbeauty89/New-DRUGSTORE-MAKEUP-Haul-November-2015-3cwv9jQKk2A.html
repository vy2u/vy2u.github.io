going to be sharing with you a drugstore
haul so I've got a lot of different
brands and different kinds of drugstore
items that I've recently picked up it's
kind of collective over the past I would
say month it's not even longer but one
in particular a brand I've never tried
is mu A which is makeup Academy which is
available in the UK or it has been for a
while but it's just now becoming more
readily available here in the United
States so I picked up a few things from
there just to kind of get a feel like
you guys know so I'll definitely include
swatches of these things and talk about
kind of the wear time etc so if you're
interested just keep watching alright so
let's go ahead and start with the MUA
items because I'm really really excited
to share them with you guys so we'll
start with the main thing that I'm
wearing that I have a lot of feelings
about this is the MUA I don't know what
it's called I'll list it right here it's
some sort of like liquid lipstick or
like a matte dry liquid product and it's
in the shade number 202 rose and I'm
wearing out my lips today it does dry
completely down completely matte it the
brush I don't love it's one of those
kind of it's like a true brush it's not
a doe foot applicator the color is
gorgeous like I said it doesn't transfer
at all I was just kissing my husband
Tyler cuz he always focuses the camera
for me and then leave so I can film so I
gave the kiss and he tried to kiss me
here I'm like no you can actually kiss
me on my lips it's not gonna come off
he's like whoa like it really is good at
that but the brush kind of because of
the brush like some of the bristles on
it are like a mess and that it was
getting us on my lip like oh my gosh and
then on top of that it dries so quickly
which is great but it's so dry you guys
it is the driest formula I've ever tried
like literally instantly
inside of my lips were like beat it up
with dryness it was so Gerson my lips
aren't chapped right now they're not dry
so there's not really a reason for it
other than it's just the formula so that
really disappointed me enough that I
think I'll still wear this every so
often cuz I do like the color at least
as I'm getting used to it but I will not
purchase another color in this in this
range because it's I'm not I'm not and
for as impress as I hope to be with that
but sorry down on the negative no
because a lot of the other stuff is
amazing so one of my favorite things
from anyway is this eyeshadow palette it
is called their nude eyeshadow palette
simple simple name it says exactly what
it is and it's got 10 different shades
and they are right up my alley I love
this so much it reminds me of the Sonia
Kashuk eye on neutral palette in a way
but I like this even better they're all
really really pigmented but not so much
that you can't work with them like I
feel like with some palettes even
high-end palettes that I love
they can be difficult to work with
because they're so pigmented that you're
almost like okay what do I even do with
that you know what I mean but these they
blend pretty well together I'm wearing
them on my eyes today I know the
Lighting's kind of watch me out a bit
but I'm wearing them today and I love
using them is this my favorite palette
in the world like over my lorac Pro
palette that is just one of my loves no
but it is it amazing for the drugstore
price and what I still recommend it no
matter what yes because like I said the
color payoff is beautiful it's a good
range they have I think two other
palettes available here I know one is
more colorful maybe it's only one other
I know if you're interested top T from
glam life guru has talked about a lot of
these MUA palettes as well and she's
down to some swatching I think and maybe
even tutorials I don't know and she's
used the brighter palette so but I
really love this neutral one and if
you're like me a neutral girl I think
you'll really like it so I also got some
other anyway products for lips because I
wanted to kind of get an idea cuz lips
are kind of what I'm really really
really into right now so this is lip
gloss they have again they don't have
the name of it
exactly I'll list it there it's a number
110 bear and it just is this nude lip
gloss with a doe foot applicator which I
like but it actually packs some color it
is a true gloss it's not like a you know
a matte lipstick like this but it
actually has some color and it's got
that kind of new almost peachy color so
I've really been liking it lately it's
great at toning down really bright
colors or dark colors but it's also
beautiful on its own so I really liked
this the there's not really a smell I
don't think at all but I like the shade
a lot and it's pretty comfortable on the
lips so that is what I would recommend I
also got one of their lipsticks just
there anyway lipsticks in number 251
mauve and I mean it's really really
creamy it's a really really pretty color
they're really pigmented I was so
impressed now I've only worn this once
cuz I did get these recently so I don't
know about where time lives like if it
slides out your lip line because it is
really creamy I wonder if it would slide
out like the corners of your mouth and
for me like I swear like I like collect
saliva when I talk I don't know what's
wrong with me so for me like that is a
problem that when lipstick runs in the
corners of my lips or outside the
corners this is such a pretty color I do
want to try maybe some more neutral ones
in this range cuz it's such I just love
that the last no I got two more MUA
items and then a bunch of other stuff
this is their professional no crease
eyeshadow base this is amazing this is
like concealer for your eyelids it's
amazing now it's got it's just a squeezy
tube and it's a noon color so if you're
a deeper skin gal I don't know if it
will work for everyone that's what I'll
say which seems to be a trend anyway
unfortunately but it really it conceals
if you've got a similar skin tone it
completely conceals the area which is
awesome and it makes your brow stand out
even more especially if you get it right
up under there and it holds onto shadow
now it is um what I like about it is
it's not super tacky like some of them
are but it's not really really too
creamy either it's
in between so I love that I love it I am
I was so impressed with this this is one
that when I run out of it and I will I
will repurchase because I already love
it that much the last time you a item I
picked up is their intense color gel
eyeliner I got it in black I am very
impressed I've been wearing this like
crazy it is very very black stays put
all day
it's gel like in its formula which I
love and I'll even use it to go on my
upper lash line kind of a tight line but
even more on like my waterline and it
doesn't transfer down below I love it so
much I kind of want to get I think they
have a brown in the line and I want to
get that as well cuz I like to use brown
on my lower lash line very impressed
with this and it's so wonderful when you
can find a drugstore liner that works
this well because I mean liner is
something I go through very quickly
especially black liner so I'm so excited
about that fine alright so I bought
another lip product this is from L'Oreal
and it's there they don't have it named
either I'm sorry you guys I'm like the
worst in this video but it's their line
of like kind of lip gloss east Eanes
they're supposed to be reminiscent in my
opinion of the YSL Aussie stains because
they're kind of a gloss that they're a
little bit of a different formula almost
gel like this one's in rose melody and
it's a really pretty color I think it's
right there it's kind of light but it's
got a little bit of that peachy rose
almost and it's really comfortable to
wear they're not the exact same as the
widest L ones I compared them but they
do stay put for quite a while I don't
think they're as moisturizing as the YSL
but they're it's such an odd formula
anyway so you almost have to get used to
it I remember owning one of these quite
a while ago and hating it but now that I
tried the YSL 101 okay I get what it's
supposed to be like that it's supposed
to stain and it kind of feels weird but
it doesn't move and no matter what it
feels like it looks really good so it's
very odd so I'm still getting used to
this as well I'm tempted to try other
shades in the range but we'll see how I
have affairs with this one first so I
bought this Maybelline the falsies
push-up drama and I was very unimpressed
when I first put it on I was like woah
like my last
just looked amazing but after a few
minutes they ended up flattening out so
I hate it I've used it a couple days I
mentioned this in my know my October
favorites and flops as well as a big
flop for me and I was so sad because I
was ready to love it and it looked
amazing at first and then it was just
that I tried it every single day the
same thing happened so I'm like you know
it's not worth it have there plenty of
other mascaras I really like so the last
two things I picked up were two
different foundations this one is the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous and this
is one that I have I might have even
gotten rid of because the shade was just
way too light for me and I've realized
lately that I have a much more yellow
skin tone than I thought
so to match my skin to my like neck and
everywhere else I need to be more
cognizant of that so I actually got a
much darker shade than I would have
thought I needed this is in 842 which is
medium beige but I it matches my skin it
matches my neck and I think it's because
it's more of a yellow tone and as I
blend it out it's not as dark as you
would think so I've been very impressed
this color is so much more correct for
me but the formula is nice I think it
actually stays put pretty well
especially comparison to the next
foundation which is this Ready Set
gorgeous by covergirl I had heard so
many people say they love this stuff
and I saw it and they was buy one get
one half off and that's why I got both
and I was like okay I'm just gonna do it
so I got the shade 210 which again is
more yellowy and it's a pretty good
match but it oxidized within hours now I
haven't tried it with a primer yet since
I just got these but I am in a try to
the primer I wore just on its own which
is what I do with most foundations
anyway but my skin I mean any of my
hyperpigmentation and frequent freckles
just came right through and it just did
not look good by the end of the day I
would say by a couple hours into the day
so I definitely need to wear this with
the primer and see how it works but so
far not loving it but I want
definitely give it a try since I know so
many people do love it so let me know
below if you do if you are one of those
people that love this what primary are
you using with it because I'm so curious
and I want to love it as well I mean I
spend my money on so I want so I pick it
so those were all of the new items I'm
trying out right now I get tons of
different things sent to me from
companies I don't only show them a lot
of them are higher end ones and since I
love drugstore and that is what my
channels rooted in and what I love I
don't always like to show all of that
but if you are interested let me know
because I'm thinking about doing maybe
like every few months like a I don't
know what to call like products that
companies have sent me or you know that
way I can show them to you guys let you
know kind of my initial thoughts on them
or so you can see what's out there but I
don't want that to like take over my
channel so let me know what your ideas
are because I I need some some
inspiration when it comes to that it
might be a very new kind of a video but
I'm interested to maybe try it so let me
know your guys's thoughts don't worry
I'm not leaving the drugstore the dust
that's never gonna happen so don't you
worry your cute little face alright so
I'm gonna leave you guys alone

than I envisioned which happens all the
time I'm just chatting up a storm today
