a nail polish a nail polish I walked out
of that drugstore with 80 dollars worth
of makeup and no nail polish I don't
know how it happened it happened so fast
but I mean I'm really excited to review
all of these things and some of them are
things that I already own like one shade
of that I love so much that I wanted
another or two other shades up so I'm
excited to kind of show you this really
cool mix of different things now there
was a sale where I went they had Milani
buy one get one 50% off and they had
Revlon buy one get one 50% off so I kind
of went crazy with those brands but I
also have some elf L'Oreal Rimmel well I
said Milani and Revlon NYX what else
what else I think that's it what wild oh
my gosh so much stuff I can't wait to
show it to you so let's go ahead and get
started the first thing I picked up was
this NYX lip gloss now if you've watched
my lip gloss declutter I mentioned that
I love this NYX lip gloss in beige which
of course is a pink color no idea why
they called it that but I've loved it
for years but it's really really old the
one that I have and I kept saying I need
to buy a new one so I finally did I'm
wearing it today I love this lip gloss
it might be it's definitely top 5
favorite lip glosses of all time but it
might be like number one or two because
this is like the only lip gloss I've
ever bought more than one of and I I
want to put more on I love it so much
now the smell is kind of like cherries
but it's so oh my gosh just like pink
but not too pink
it's so perfect for work and going out
like it's literally the perfect lip
gloss it is the perfect lip gloss I
think for any skin tone it is so
beautiful I love it so much glad to have
a fresh one so I can kind of throw out
that really really old old one so
speaking of favorites I'll talk about a
few of those now because
it's kind of a good indicator if I
bought another shade of something that
means I really really love it
I you guys know love my Rimmel lasting
finish but the shade that I have I'm
wearing it today it is the best
foundation I've ever used but if the
shade is just a little bit too dark it
works I mean I can make it work but it's
just a little bit too dark so I picked
up the next one down which is 100 ivory
because this is so inexpensive I don't
feel guilty buying more than one shade I
love that about this it is the most
beautiful satin finish foundation I have
a whole like demo of me applying it in a
review of it I can link it below it's my
favorite ever better than Revlon
Colorstay better than any of my old
favorites this is the bomb I just
ordered a pump for this on Beauty MP
calm so I'm so excited I got one more
Rimmel product which I'm also wearing
with the lipgloss it's one of their
exaggerated full color lip liners these
are so cheap under five dollars
I already have one an east-end snob
which I love and it's just a little bit
lighter than this but this one is darker
Simo come here so I have it in the shade
enchantment and this is just a little
bit darker than East End snob and I'll
show you in this swatch here the
difference so I oh my gosh these lip
liners are so amazing I really think
they're better than my Mac ones which I
love but I I think these are better they
stay on better they're creamier oh my
gosh I wanna I almost bought a couple
more but I have so many lip liner so
like I don't need any more but I had to
have this one because this deeper one I
think might be just as useful as East
End snobbish they're both amazing I
would recommend both they're close but
just a little bit different the one elf
product I bought this time around
thanks so much else is this acne
fighting gel now I have what used to be
in this packaging that's called there's
it's a pur and it has salicylic acid in
it but this one it might be the same
formula I don't know but this one says
it has Salus
acid tea tree and aloe and it's just a
little rollerball that you kind of roll
on any blemishes you have I always
travel with one of these always because
I don't want to bring like a whole
skincare regimen but this is a great
really quick easy to travel with thing
that you can throw in your makeup bag or
in your court size clear bag if you're
flying and it's just great it really
will tackle blemishes do I think it is
the most effective thing in the universe
no but I always reach for even when I'm
at home if I have a blemish it's my kind
of first line of defense so I love this
stuff I hope it's the same or maybe it's
even better but it was 2 bucks
can't can't lose with that I also bought
another of my beloved L'Oreal voluminous
I I love a lot of mascaras but this is
the only mascara I constantly go back
and repurchase and if I don't have one
in my collection at any given time I
have to go buy one because I go back to
it after every mascara because I'll try
one and I like it but then I go back to
this one and I feel like I didn't use it
today and I feel like my lashes could
use some judging judging ups so this is
what I always go for this time I got the
waterproof plaque because my wedding is
coming up soon so I want to try this out
and see if I like it I'm also going to
San Diego and I'll be a little sweaty
err there than I have been here so I
don't know I'm excited I've never tried
the waterproof formula and I'm sure it's
just as amazing we will see her at like
9 more products I told you it was a lot
so the only one wild thing I picked up
this time is one of their mega last
colors I have a couple that I love but
this one is way different this is in
Raven raisin and it's just this really
deep kind of purplish toned color and
what I love about these is that they're
so virtually matte and I do think that
if you do have dry skin on your lips
these don't work because they are so dry
but you cannot beat a dollar ninety-nine
and they've got a huge color range I
think these are awesome to have in your
collection
especially for colors that you know
you're not going to wear a lot like this
one I think it's great because you can
have that option without having to spend
a lot of money on like a MAC lipstick or
an even more expensive one I think these
are pretty darn good and I'm excited to
give this one a try I probably won't be
wearing it in the spring and summer but
I'm
to just have it in my collection I
actually had a few more of these in my
cart at the store but I was at like the
self scan and I couldn't get the scan to
work on the last two so it's like oh my
gosh forget it and there was like a
whole line of people and like forget it
I was getting all frustrated and
flustered so I didn't end up buying the
other two but I did buy this I'll
probably eventually go back and get the
other colors so my last grouping of
products are a bunch from Milani and a
bunch from Revlon because these are the
ones that are on sale so I bought four
different products of each the Milani
ones the first thing I grabbed was their
eyeshadow primer
I have heard really good things about
this and I I mean honestly I don't have
really oily eyelids so I don't find that
I mean I find that pretty much any
primer works for me that's what I'll say
but this one has a nude color and so I'm
hoping it will help to kind of cancel
out any like veining I have or any
discoloration just to make it so I have
a blank slate a lot of times I'll use my
Mac Paint Pot in painterly because it is
a nude color and that's thicker than
this but I do think this is gonna be
nice to just have as a drugstore option
for something that has that nude color
like my Too Faced shadow insurance does
as well
I finally got another one of the Milani
matte colors right now the only one I
have is matte blissful and I got rid of
all my other Milani lipsticks that were
regular cuz of the smell I just it
really does make me sick to my stomach
but the matte ones have like a sweeter
smell it's not the same at all so matte
bliss feels like a light pink this one
is matte naked and it's much more of a
classic nude color that everyone's going
gaga over right now I do think it's
really pretty these the matte formula
the Milani uses is very moisturizing for
a matte lip color I do though it is it
does need a lip liner because they are a
little moisturizing so they can tend to
crawl outside of your lip line unless
you line with something close so this is
a beautiful color I'm really excited to
wear this like real excited I love these
and honestly their packaging always
looks so high-end I mean and I know that
doesn't really matter but if you're a
beauty junkie like me it totally makes
you want to buy it
I mean it's so smart of them to make
really cute packaging another Milani
product I bought is their shadow eyes
but this
is in almond cream and it's one of their
math colors now again same idea you know
when I got this primer of theirs this I
would use as a primer as well and just
kind of color on my lid and then just
rub it in with my fingers and have kind
of like a Mac painterly just a matte
cream colored base for me now obviously
if you are not my skin tone at all if
you're much darker skinned this would
not work for you the same way and it
didn't look like they have some other
deeper colors that were brown but I
don't know that they were Maps so I
don't know if it would work the same but
I am excited to give this one a try
because I've heard really good things
the last Milani product I bought was the
Milani baked blush and this is one of
them at once and I've been eyeing this
sucker forever it's in the shade
delicioso pink and it's just a really
matte vibrant baby pink and I actually
put it on today I had already had a
blush on but I wanted to try this I
didn't realize how pigmented it was and
so when I applied it to this cheek it
was like boom I'm like clown pink
literally I saw myself and what no no
and it looked like an actual clown hey
daddy hello Jessica's dad you know this
is my darling he was so cute daddy I can
smell that cigar smoke Roman my baby
alright I get my horse and ride okay
so anyways so when I applied it to my
cheeks it was like clown pink for real I
could not believe it but of course I
blended it out with like my foundation
brush that I had some foundation off
from earlier so it worked out well I
think this is an absolutely beautiful
beautiful blush you just have to be
light with it which I have learned
quickly and again the packaging come on
now the other matte one they had at the
store I was at which is called Meyer
most people don't have a Meyer near them
but was a much more vibrant I mean this
is already vibrant it was like a car but
never wear like an orange but if you had
darker skin it would look beautiful so
that would be another option now my last
four products are from Revlon and I am
one to yeah I've never tried any of
these and they're like I've never even
heard anything about any of these so I'm
so excited to review these the first
thing I picked up is was this Revlon
Photoready
rush effect and I've got to be honest
every time I've ever seen their products
in these packaging I thought they were
like the spray things and I'm not have
all about that like airbrush life so I
have always just overlooked it never
even thought about it but they had this
shade that I thought would be perfect
for my skin because it is a little
yellow I know on camera it looks kind of
crazy but when it's blended out I have a
feeling this will be perfect it's in the
shade zero zero two vanilla and I know
that their vanilla shade and they're
nearly naked is a perfect color match
for me this seemed a little bit deeper
but I don't know I'm so excited to give
this a try
I have no idea what to expect but I do
love that it's got a pump and I think it
the packaging is cute now that I know
it's not like a spray I don't know why I
thought it was so I will let you guys
know I might do a whole review demo
video on this because I haven't really
heard a ton about this next product I
got I have never even seen in the stores
and it's the Revlon Colorstay concealer
I almost called it the nail polish and I
had it I found it in the lightest shade
zero one fair and it's actually light I
feel like so many drugstore concealers
don't actually go light but this one
actually is really light kind of gray
toned which I think might be really nice
it'll actually provide a contrast
between my under-eye and the rest of my
face so I am really excited to give this
a try it's just got a classic don't foot
applicator I don't know what to expect
it is thin but it looks like it's got
pretty good coverage I'm just excited I
don't know how I've never heard anyone
talk about this they have their
Colorstay concealer that I've tried that
has like a it's this shape but it has
like a sponge on the top and you twist
the bottom and it comes through but it's
like a hard sponge and I hated that
stuff I don't know if this is like the
same formula but different packaging but
they had both for sale in the stores so
I can't imagine them being the exact
same actual formula but I am really
excited to try this I will definitely
let you guys know maybe I'll do like a
two-in-one review I don't know though
cuz these aren't even the same line but
we'll see the next thing I picked up is
a Revlon lip color and this is their
Colorstay ultimate suede in the shade
socialite and it just kind of looks like
a peachy I haven't swatch this yet yeah
it's kind of a more sheer wash of color
I thought these would be like
really pigmented the way that I I don't
know why I thought that but it's more of
a sheer glossy finish and this is like a
kind of a peachy color but it's not too
orange peachy that you know a really
orange peach looks crazy on someone with
fair skin at least on mine it does but
this looked like a much more wearable
and I loved the name socialite it makes
me think of like olden days like Paris
Hilton ridiculousness socialite
I guess Kim Kardashian is the new
socialite isn't she the last thing might
be the thing I'm the most excited about
this is the Revlon Rose glow
highlighting palette so the shade is
rose glow they had a few of these but
this one looks like I could actually I
mean it looks like a really pinkish
highlighter but it looks like I could
also wear it just as a wash of kind of a
pinkish glow color like a blush and when
you swatch them all together it is a
really pale pink shade but it does have
a little bit of color to it
and you guys is this not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen oh my
gosh and of course you could just you
know get a little bit of more of the
highlighting shade but um oh that's just
a totally different color more like
peach of course I still have the old
stuff on there anyway I am so excited
and I loved that the packaging was
actually pretty thin I don't know why
but I feel like a lot of drugstore
packaging for blush is always either
really bulky or it just has like that
room for the little brush that I never
used so I hate that but this one was
packaged really well I think for most
skin tones this would truly just be a
highlight but a few are as fair as me I
I am so excited about this stuff oh my
gosh I can't I like part of me wants to
take off my blush and put this on so
those I think are all of the things that
I got I know it was a lot but let me
know what you are the most interested in
me reviewing you guys know the way I do
reviews is i demo them while i review
them just so you can see what they
actually look like when you're applying
them instead of just talking about it so
let me know what you're interested in me
