going to share with you guys a humongous
elf hall hall I didn't necessarily buy
all of these things some of them are
given to me from ELF whether it was like
sent in a box some of it was a gift from
them when I went to an elf event in New
York this past week and it was so
amazing I will link the vlog of my time
there it was the most New York II trip
and the most like overwhelmingly amazing
trip and I have all of you guys to thank
so thank you guys so much this video is
not sponsored or anything like that they
don't know I'm filming this but I wanted
to show you guys because I know a lot of
you guys love elf products there's a lot
of brand-new items in here that I can't
wait to show you so let's go and get
into it
I'm wearing one of these things on my
face today this was actually inspired by
my new friend Carol I will link her
channel below she is the most gorgeous
kind person I've like ever met I just
love her and she was one of those people
when I met her I just felt like we were
like soul sisters like as if we knew
each other in another life because it
was so comfortable talking to her and
getting to know her she is amazing she
does incredible tutorials but she was
wearing this one of the days while we
were in New York and I was like oh my
gosh so I had to pick it out this is the
elf long lasting lustrous eyeshadow in
soiree and I'm wearing it today just on
my eyelid and a little bit underneath my
lower lash line but it's just this semi
creamy it almost feels like a cream
shadow I mean it kind of is it's just
the most interesting texture it kind of
reminds me of the colour-pop ones but
this color is just this gorgeous kind of
like wine-red type color but there's
glitter but what I love about it is it
looks glittery but there's no fallout
and that's why it is like one of the
best products I've ever tried I have a
gold and a silver one that I really
really like but this color kind of
sealed the deal for me I really like it
how is it that I start every video like
every filming session without something
to wipe my swatches off with like every
single time I forget about it like how
after a couple years so I not remember
to get that anyway let's keep going this
is a blush called it's their studio
blush called mellow mauve oh my gosh
isn't this the most perfect blush color
you've ever seen if you have a skin tone
similar to mine it's kind of a satin
finish it's just a really light color
but it is the perfect neutral everyday
plush and these last all day and of
course like all of elfs products are
really really inexpensive I'm wearing
this blush on my cheeks today and I
think it's just a really nice like I
said just neutral everyday color and I
think it blends really nicely into
everything else
it ends up because it's not glittery or
shimmery on its own it's just that satin
finish it looks amazing if you do want
that pop of a highlight on top of it you
don't have to worry about this kind of
combating with that it's just it is
perfect this was something that everyone
is raving about I hadn't tried and even
when we were in this store they were
telling us that this was something that
like people are buying like crazy and it
is the elf well I have no idea I will
link the name of it part of their
beautifully bear line I will have a list
of all the products I'm mentioning down
below with links so I'll have the name
of this down there but it's a primer
that's really moisturizing I haven't had
the chance to try it yet but I am really
excited because that's the kind of a
primer that I like it's just a squeezy
tube it's it comes out white and then as
you blend it it just oh my gosh it has
like kind of that silicone type feel
where it's really almost slippery and
velvety but it feels moisturizing at the
same time has kind of a nice scent to
but it is cents so if you're sensitive
to scents you might not like it but I
like it
I am so excited to give this a try
especially as we're moving into fall and
winter and my skin is getting more and
more dry so I also picked out two of
their brand new aqua beauty line
products well actually I got a couple I
hadn't even heard of this so they have
this new line called cooled what called
aqua Beauty aqua what is wrong with me
today they have a new line called aqua
beauty and I picked out two of the
shades so this one is called molted this
one is called molten bronze and these
are their molten liquid eyeshadows by
the way I was excited about these
they've got some brands have this like
in the drugstore but it's just a doe
foot applicator with a cream
shadow and I'd like these cuz the
consistency is thinner so it's really
easy to spread out really quickly before
it dries and I love this shade it's just
such a pretty bronze color kind of the
perfect one shadow look you can put it
on so much it into your crease and leave
I'm really big on that because you know
like when you've got a full time you
know daytime job or anytime job you are
trying to get ready as quickly as you
can while still looking looking put
together so this one I also got this one
is called rose gold and this one i've
swatched in the store and fell in love
it reminds me of like there's a benefit
cream shadow called RSVP it reminds me
of that kind of like a lighter pink I
just watch it in a weird place there it
goes it's like a lighter pink champagne
e rose gold really is a good name but
it's like a lighter rose gold I love it
I think these are easy to work with
and I've only used them like once but
even on the swatches they're just
gorgeous they catch the light really
nicely and I really like it the next
thing I picked up because I've never
tried them and that kind of blows my
mind
but it's the elf makeup removing
cleansing cloths and this is a pack of
20 I love that it has like the snap type
closure they have another one with less
in it as well but I like that it's just
the sleek black packaging I use these
all the time
I don't use wipes to clean off my makeup
unless I'm traveling I usually do but I
do use these to kind of wipe my swatches
off like right now I'm in the middle of
my Clinique peps start ones that they
recently sent I've only used like one I
don't know if they're like any good yet
or not but the elf ones I figure are
gonna be just as awesome and exactly
what I need them for and I would much
rather pay a lot less and again I kind
of like like pink is my favorite color
but like comparing the packaging I kind
of like the black packaging better I
think it it's just sleek it reminds me
of like the matte ones as well so
another thing I picked up coz every one
of you guys was recommending this this
is the elf baked highlighter and blush
gems
it's one of their baked ones you already
know that it looks like Mac soft and
gentle it is just a really pretty
it never does it just
just a really pretty highlighter you can
use these wet or dry like most baked
products I feel like you could even use
this as an eye shadow it's just really
pretty I haven't gotten actually use it
on my face yet so I'm really excited to
give that a try and kind of try it
side-by-side with other products that
are similar that are maybe more
expensive to see the wear time and how
they wear compared to each other and
just in the middle of this I was
explaining to my co-workers like what I
do with my youtube job because a lot of
them don't really understand this world
I mean most people don't so they had a
lot of questions for me when I came back
from New York like where I was and like
what I was doing and stuff and I
remember one of my co-workers said oh so
since you did that with that brand elf
cosmetics she did that trip then you've
got to talk really highly about their
brand like all the time you can't like
say anything bad about any of your
products and that question was so
interesting to me because I was like no
like of course I'm still gonna be honest
about their products cuz that doesn't
matter and I would like to think that a
really good company would want to hear
the good with the bad because a they
need to know that if you know a product
they put out really isn't that great or
maybe there's a bad batch out there they
would want to know that but also any
smart company would know that an
influencer or someone like a blogger
vlogger whatever is putting content out
there about your brand people are gonna
trust someone that is honest about it
and say the good things but also the bad
things about it because then it's
believable and it's real and it's true
and they know that their subscribers
would believe them more often so so I
just want you to know I know like I just
did that and then I'm doing this elf
haul kind of but it's not I mean I'm
doing this just for fun
and I hope you guys see that and that if
I try some of these products and I hate
them I always let you know whether it's
in like a best and worst monthly video
or maybe products I regret buying I do a
lot of those so don't feel like I'm just
gonna you know say only positive things
because obviously there are some elf
products I have not liked in the past
and I always tell you guys about it and
I will continue to do so tangent is over
let's keep going alright oh my gosh this
is what I'm excited about I've had a
similar one to this but I don't think
I've had this shade so I picked out the
elf powder fector in
glow and I picked it out because there
was another youtuber at the store with
me that has watched this and I was like
what is that swatch on your hand and she
told me and I said I don't know like I
feel like my skin tone is way too light
for that and so she swatch it on my hand
and I was like okay you're right like it
it looks awesome on everyone it's a very
very glittery lip gloss it's got a brush
applicator but just wait till you see
this up close look at all that glitter
it is ridiculous and with so much like
shimmery glittery glossy looks on lips
right now and like how that's kind of
becoming popular again thank goodness I
think this is a really good way to do
more of a metallic look without going
full metallic it's kind of right in
between and I think that is so perfect
based on what's kind of on trend right
now oh my gosh it's so pretty I don't
even like want to wipe that off if so
I'm so excited about this is another new
product of theirs this is the elf aqua
Beauty blush and bronzer and it's aqua
infused I would describe this as a
hybrid between a cream and a powder it's
right in between and but I wouldn't call
it cream to powder either because I
don't always love cream to powder
products but it's a duo and it's in
bronze and pink beige and let me take
off a little I dumped my nail in it I
hate when I do that so it looks really
kind of intimidating I know and they had
a couple shades but it is like a cream I
don't know how else to describe it to
you but it's also a powder oh my gosh
they're so pigmented and I really liked
they had the cream bronzer and blush duo
and I actually really like that and I
was shocked at how pigmented it was but
how well it blended but also how well it
stayed on but this is totally more my
ally because I like cream products but
they're not my favorite the powder
products especially in the wintertime
don't look awesome on my skin either
these are the perfect combination and I
am so excited to try these out for real
if you are in like if you live near an
elf studio store go in and swatch this
because I didn't think I needed any more
blush and bronzer and then I swatch this
and I was like oh my gosh
this in my life I also got their nude
rose gold palette I really liked the elf
mad format palette because it's all
matte and it's really really good
especially considering the price this
one is so beautiful it's just kind of
got these shimmery shades mixed in with
the matte shades and I just think
there's so many pretty colors to work
with I will say it kicks up some powder
but as long as you're smart about using
it you know knowing that it kicks up
powder if you're gonna purchase this or
if you already have it just make sure
that you tap your brush off before you
apply it or you know you could spray
your brush so that way it's not getting
everywhere you know just take those
precautions if you're gonna buy this but
like these are three shades that I think
are really really pretty they're just
really nice and again I think the matte
shadows are in there the only thing I
would change I would add one more darker
matte shadow I don't think that I think
they just need one more but I think it's
really really beautiful I really like
this deeper purple kind of eggplant
shade it's got a gold glitter in it I
think it's really really pretty
so loved that I also got their shadow
lock eyelid primer because it's been a
while since I've tried one of their
primers this one comes across let me
show you another swatch it is white when
you apply it but you know it kind of
blends in and I kind of like that it's
white because it of course it blends out
but I like that it kind of lightens the
area because then any color you apply is
gonna stand out just a little bit more
so the next thing I got is this eyeliner
and shadow stick and brown basic so I
just pop the lid off so one of them is a
liner and this is a brown liner perfect
for everyday I even like even today not
this that I used a brown liner just in
my waterline just to kind of darken it a
little bit but not as stark as black but
then the shadow part is much thicker and
this is oh my gosh so there it is
so golden and just glittery perfect to
kind of pop on the inner corner or put
all over your lid whatever it's so
pretty so that was
and then the other one I got was in
black and smoke so the liner in this is
black and then the shadow is more of
like a darker silver so again it's just
retractable there's the black one next
to the brown one just so you can kind of
see the difference and then the other
side is that kind of charcoal silver I
think that's gonna be so pretty in the
like wintertime even if you didn't want
to put it all over your eyelid but just
smudge again on the lower lashline i
think would be absolutely gorgeous
one thing that they sent was this
moisturizing lipstick and black out they
sent this actually a while ago but I
wanted to show it to you guys because if
you like those black lips I love their
moisturizing lipstick it's totally up my
alley because I like matte but I'm very
picky about matte formulas but these are
moisturizing and I would much prefer a
moisturizing regular lipstick over a
matte one you're gonna die look how
black that is that looks like you're
just freakin putting a black cream liner
all over your lips it is so black I mean
that is just one swatch a really crappy
one but you know black so if you are
looking for just a straight-up like the
name the name is perfect black out
that's exactly what it is it's not
pretending to be anything that it's not
it is straight-up black so if you're
looking for that whether it's for
Halloween or just you like that this is
your BAE
so I'm also doing a giveaway of just
some elf products that I think you would
like there are five products in this

of you guys would love this I also

the beautifully bare total face palette

won't swatch it this is beautiful like
silver already gotten smudges all over

love this palette so much so this is one
that is part of the giveaway another
favorite of mine I'm giving away is
their lip exfoliator and sweet cherry
