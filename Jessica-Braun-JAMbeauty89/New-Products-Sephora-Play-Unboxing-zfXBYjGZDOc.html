a sephora play unboxing this is $10 a
month and you kind of just order it like
through your Sephora account on spoors
website and I've recently done it I can
link my most recent support play
unboxing down below this is for December
but I almost didn't show it and I
thought you know what I think it's worth
showing so because if you're curious
like maybe before January like I don't
know if I want to subscribe
it might be worth seeing at least what
was in here even though I would assume
you probably can't get this exact same
box so let's go ahead and get into it
first thing that's in here it's like in
a little baggie oh they always send five
different like deluxe sized things in a
little bag and they always also
separately have a perfume sample it's
not one of the five but they always do
give one which is nice because again one
of the main reasons I still get this box
and the reason I like this box and I
really don't do any other subscription
boxes anymore it's because these are all
products I can actually find a Sephora
whereas a lot of them would be random
brands which is so cool because you get
to try all kinds of brands but at the
same time they're not always as easy to
find and order and I just didn't like
that so this is the Atelier cologne from
Paris and it's their Clementine
California let's just see it definitely
died on my nose I think it smells good
it's oh yeah you can kind of smell the
like kind of orange e I'm assuming
there's like an orange she no oh yes if
you look at the post card Jessica you
would see it was the warmest summer on
record and the mood was equally intense
at the film studios he had been
searching for her for months growing
tired of the perfect actress type about
to give up the moment came when it all
changed
there she was at the end of the counter
the woman he'd been dreaming up her
natural beauty and distinct voice would
for sure steal scene he now had to
convince her to change the course of her
life I'm spitting everywhere
ah fun Oh Clementine California so that
would explain why there's oranges and
there's like welcome to Hollywood and
that kind of stuff
definitely orange e but not like
obviously citrus like I would never
smell this and be like Oh someone's
wearing something super citrusy it's not
like that it's nice it's nice if you're
in a Sephora and they have it there
smell it it's kind of complicated in a
nice way though unusually weird sense
I'm like no thank you
I'll stick to my like sweet ones I
actually kind of like this so this is
going to go in my little travel choice
each war because that's usually how I
actually use these up awesome so
interesting so the first well first of
all let me just show you the little bag
it says glam straight I get it glam
straight um that's kind of cute so it
does look like kind of old retro kind of
Hollywood actually what is that um like
in Miami what do they call that so oh
and they also always give you like
insider points so there's 50 butyrate
Beauty Insider points and that you can
get and then they give you info about
everything dude so let's go ahead and
dig in the first thing in here is this
dr. jart sic a pair tiger grass cream
the power tiger grass helps to soothe
sensitized skin resulting from external
environmental stressors centella
asiatica ingredients complex three herbs
strengthens skin through moisturization
mineral and panthenol relieve redness
due to dryness highly concentrated
texture is absorbed quickly upon
applying to the skin makes the ultimate
healthy-looking skin finish by
replenishing skins moisture barrier that
sounds like something I could use right
now says after using toner and serum
apply a moderate amount on desensitize
skin press cream into skin with the
warmth of hands to allow for maximum
absorption so you'll start trying this
tonight I am intrigued so you know it's
a smaller sized sample but really with
skincare that's kind of nice because you
can figure out if you even like it you
know what I mean it stinks when you buy
like a full-size of something just on a
whim and you're like oh crap I hate this
so I'm definitely intrigued I'm
intrigued and I not heard
single thing about that so that's pretty
cool I'll let you guys know how that one
goes
all right next thing in the bag is this
dry bar triple sec three and one I've
heard people talk about the dry bar
triple sec says texturizers amplifies
refreshes shake extremely well Spray
four to six inches from dry hair safe
for colored hair um let me see what
their little pamphlet says about it like
I don't know it says this Airy spray
revised lifeless strands adds volume and
body extension blow up that's nice
because I typically will use hairspray
for this which I mean this is kind of
hair spray like if I've worn my hair
like this all day and I'm like okay
we're I'm home from work and we're going
out I'll kind of flip my hair upside
down and just spray some hairspray kind
of re Sprunt and so that way it's
kind of Reval you mies it smells better
you know all that stuff so it sounds
like this would kind of do that job for
me so and that's something I do like
every single day so that's I'm intrigued
I almost hope I don't like it because I
think it's expensive but at the same
time I hope I like it it's such a
conundrum
you guys get subscription boxes anymore
I feel like there was such a time where
it was like the thing you know what I
mean like I was unboxing so many on my
channel a couple years ago and now it's
kind of like it's kind of it's time is
past so if you guys do still get
subscription boxes which ones do you
still get women treat boxycharm is
pretty darn good that one was pretty
darn good I did like that one for a long
time alright next thing is from Make Up
For Ever it's their artist Rouge matte
lip stick I think it might be in a red
shade which is fun this is definitely
like a small deluxe a little tiny baby
lipstick I don't really like baby
lipsticks I know so many people are like
oh but oh that is creamy that feels like
my Marc Jacobs lip creams that I love
like crazy creamy holy moly
so it's the shade m4o one definitely
matte but definitely creamy oh my gosh I
love this shade of red kind of a blue
toned red you know what I mean it's not
like it's a like a cool tone red umm
what I was saying is I really don't like
baby lipsticks and I don't know why I
feel like
seem like mmm like I don't feel like
think why there's nothing wrong with
them and they are kind of cute but I
like feel like I get them and I never
use them anyone else all right next
thing you know this looks bigger this is
from Clinique and if they're pretty easy
liquid eyeliner pen feel like this is
like a freaking full-size yeah this has
got to be a full size so that's pretty
cool I'm assuming it's a liquid liner
yep it's got a brush tip which I
typically really like first swatch not
super black but it was just the first
watch okay it's getting blacker I will
say this it's nowhere near as black as
the NYX epic epic the NYX epic ink
liquid liner that stuff is like crazy
black and the best stuff ever and it's
way cheaper um so so far just watch wise
in like hmm and with liner you can tell
the swatches that's one of the few
products that you can pretty much tell
right away how it's gonna wear how it's
gonna look because you're doing the same
thing you know you're putting it on the
same way as you do on your hand whereas
with shadow it can be different and
blush because you're not taking blush
and going like this you know so I will
try it out but so far already not
totally impressed all right next thing
in here last thing in here is from
Smashbox
what was it I shadow two tiny little
eyeshadows was it say they look like
wearable colors it says behold the
golden a high pigment eyeshadow palette
featuring warm bronzer shade okay so
these are shades from the Smashbox cover
shot oh it says cover shot eyes shadow
duo in Golden Hour so maybe it's not
from like one of the cover shot things
the colors in this duo will give you
that sunlit Southern California glow
well I do like the colors I don't know
why I'm like making fun of everything
everyone's saying in these I'm just
being sassy tonight ooh the brown one
was a little bit powdery which you know
you just tap your brush off pretty color
so I feel like I'd put the kind of
pinkish one all over the lid in the
brown one just a little bit into the
crease and maybe on my lower lash line
and that'd be a complete look so
interesting
I do not have any Smashbox pallets I
have I ever owned I really I don't think
that I have I didn't even tried those
cover shot ones so let me know am I
missing out on something like are they
really really good
I heard pretty good things about the
cover shop outs I just I don't know I
never felt that strongly enough to go
buy it but maybe I should you guys let
me know oh I will say one of the first
high-end like things I ever bought was
for Smashbox it was a like little trio
like a circle trio of eyeshadows from
Smashbox it was like purple and
something and that was like the first
high-end and i like freaking baby that
stuff oh my gosh i loved it so much well
so i guess i do have experience with
smashbox Smashbox shadows so that was
everything in the box i mean all in all
i am actually quite excited about this
sick of hair stuff the lipstick was
actually pretty darn impressive the
shadow seems nice the liner seems okay
but it was cool that it was the full
size and then just drive our thing it
feels like it's empty don't you hate
that um I will definitely try and let
you guys know so worth ten dollars this
time around I mean if the liner was good
I would say that alone is almost worth
ten dollars and then you get all the
added stuff to it you know maybe so I
think that's pretty cool let me know if
you've already tried some of these
products if you think they're really
really good I'm just curious let me know
down below and other than that I hope
that you will give it a thumbs up
subscribe if you enjoyed it and I'll see
you guys in my next one
