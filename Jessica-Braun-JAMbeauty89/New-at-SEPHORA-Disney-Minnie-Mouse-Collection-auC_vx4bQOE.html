going to share with you a hall slash
swatch slash mini review video of the
new Sephora Disney Minnie Mouse
Collection I own three of the products
I'm looking at their website now and
three they have one two three four five
six seven products and three of them are
already sold out I only bought three
products and one of these two sold out
I'll show that one at the end so let's
go and get into it so if you know a
little bit about me you know that I love
Disney we go to Disney World all the
time I'm obsessed and I love Minnie
Mouse so this is very exciting and I
love all of you guys because so many of
you guys tweeted me when this was coming
out you tagged me in Instagram photos
you snapchatted me everything it was
amazing so I was gung-ho and this
finally came out the first thing I knew
I wanted to purchase when it came out
was the eyeshadow palette now this was
$45 so I was like oh my gosh but I'm
thinking okay it is so worth it though
it's my fall of my favorite things
combined like I feel like I had to buy
it now the prop the packaging is
adorable but it is very very bulky so
you know looking at this compared to my
other palettes like oh my gosh this is
taking up so much room like I won't ever
travel with it for that reason alone but
it's so cute the color choices in it are
kind of interesting it has this mirror
at the top and then the colors in it are
it's very colorful and none of them seem
to go together but I understood gotten a
lot of really good looks out of it even
for me a neutral girl because when I got
it I was like okay this is a lot of
color but this middle row right here is
very neutral and then like even like
this matte white there's a matte black
there's this beautiful matte kind of
medium brown there's this like kind of
yellowish color that's a good blending
color so even though upon first glance
it looks like a lot of color it's
actually only a few colors in a lot of
neutrals even this like be my bow it's
kind of a charcoal gray I've used
ex-boyfriends like this purplish kind of
lilac silver color I really like so all
of these ended up working really well
together now their pigmentation is
amazing I'm going to swatch ex-boyfriend
is that like really pretty kind of
purplish this pick me up at 8 is this
deep matte Brown
some might get da is this gorgeous
bronzy gold oh my gosh let me get like a
color this is Whoopi party I mean
they're ridiculously pigmented they
blend really well together I mean
honestly I was very pleasantly surprised
now both the mirror and this thing
actually come out I'll show you what I
mean so if I wanted to just take this
out and like have this as an actual
clutch they both come out now will I
ever do that I don't know probably not
but it is kind of nice to know that you
can do that but it's adorable I mean
it's really well made it's not like
cheap packaging by any means but they
all came with this adorable little like
Minnie Mouse little like stretchy thing
that I could take off and put on other
things if I wanted I left it on this
sofa so that was pretty amazing now if
you know you already have enough
palettes do you need this no but if you
love Minnie Mouse maybe because all the
names like let me read you some of my
names this pink one is called hello
Mickey red carpet arrival some I'm all
ears is that black one
Mickey squeeze is this purplish one here
miss Minnie puppy love you who flirt in
the skirt I mean they're all so cute so
the next thing I got you're gonna think
that I'm wearing on my lips but I'm not
I'm wearing the next thing is the
Minnie's perfect red lipstick and this
one is 15 dollars it is very heavy I was
like wow this is nice packaging of
course it's that adorable gold with the
black polka dots and I don't ever want
to use it there's a little edging of
many on the actual part you to apply it
and then there's Minnie signature on it
as well like I never want to use it I'm
gonna swatch it on the other side just
so you can kind of see it it wasn't as I
mean it's red but it's still a little
bit of a sheer red I thought it'd be
really like POW like just as pigmented
as the eyeshadows but it's a little more
sheer
you can certainly you know layer it and
give it some more punch but it's
definitely more of a moisturizing sheer
lipstick this is kind of one that even
though it is so cute and I love it and I
felt like I had to have it I never want
to use it because it's adorable and that
defeats the purpose even having it
because I'm not a collector like I don't
collect things for that
but I know a lot of people do but I
don't and then on top of that it's not
as like punchy red as I'd hoped and I
don't really like those kind of sheer
washes of red I just don't like it on
myself so kind of one that I'm like I'm
glad I have it but I kind of feel like I
shouldn't have bought it I don't know so
take that for what it is but even the
packaging on this came with the little
cute metal mini on it and the last thing
I got was this set of cream lip stains
and it came in this tin and this one is
the one that's sold out and it is $26
it's out of stock I'm sure they will
eventually restock it I don't know but
it comes with five cream lip stains and
I'm gonna swatch all these for you these
are crazy bright like even the neutral
ish one is crazy like I put them on and
I was like nope so again it's kind of
one I'm like uh so this is the pink one
and it's thisis these smell like vanilla
these smell exactly like the Stila say
all-day lips saying things that I really
do like they also have the exact same
texture like part of me is like is it
made from the same place I don't know so
the pink one is like fluorescent pink
these are really pigmented they do stay
in place I'm wearing the red one I'll
show you laughs on my lips today and it
dries pretty quick which is pretty
awesome this is kind of an orange e red
I actually like that one it makes me
think of Taylor Swift in a way and
they're kind of miniature sized but
again this is kind of one of those
things that you wouldn't wear all that
often so you probably wouldn't run out
of it this is more of a purple it's so
pretty if you have deeper skin this
would look gorgeous the next one is the
one that I put on and I was like no my
teeth look so yellow it was pretty
comical it looks really pretty it's like
a peach one right there
but on my lips because my lips are so
pigmented it made mine lighter but this
is one of those colors that'll look
really pretty on a lot of other people
so just didn't look right on me and then
this is the one I'm actually wearing the
red these don't have names I really like
and again these dried really quick and
they have been staying in place for a
while I was wearing it for a little bit
now let me look at it close-up in this
mirror though and see how how it's
holding up you can see like the line on
the inside but that's kind of like
normal with anything that dries it
really it completely stays in place so
that
that's pretty awesome especially with a
dark or a bright color you don't want it
to move so I the cream lip stains versus
this I would totally recommend the lip
stains however there are a lot of colors
in there that I'm not gonna wear very
often like the red I'll definitely wear
the orangish red I might wear the purple
maybe maybe but the other two the bright
pink and then that peach I know it looks
crazy I'll probably pass on to like a
sister someone I know that might be able
to pull it off that is so staining right
there so I have a feeling this is gonna
be difficult to get off but that's okay
cuz it's staying in place so even the
10r might keep to hold like nail stuff
or you know there's tiny little like
cotton rounds or something cuz it's a
really cute tin so those are the three
things I picked up I really wanted to
get I'm looking at the website there
inner glow luminizing blush that is like
the one thing I knew I wanted and it was
sold out the second I tried to buy it
and that stunk it also has an eyeliner
duo a compact mirror and then there's a
brush set that has this bow holder that
I'm still kind of eyeing but I already
have where is my little brush cup right
there that gold sparkly one I really
really like someone I don't really need
it even though I love it so I'm still
kind of toying around with it so
hopefully this is enjoyable if you are
curious about more of my disney loves if
you love Disney as well as I do and you
haven't caught my channel before I just
did a Disney World haul of a bunch of
souvenirs I bought from there some
