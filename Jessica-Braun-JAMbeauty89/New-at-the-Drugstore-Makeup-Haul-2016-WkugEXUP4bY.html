going to be sharing with you a gigantic
drugstore haul these are probably
honestly my favorite videos film and I
do them like every month and they're
always huge because I love trying out
new stuff here on my channel for you
guys also just I just like trying makeup
obviously because that's why I have
channel um so this is gonna be a long
one grab a cup of tea or coffee or
something like that and join me won't
you today I'm drinking Tazo Zen tea my
favorite it's been my favorite for years
and it still is and the mug I'm using is
actually Tyler my husband it's a Walt
Disney one where it's an actual photo of
Walt Disney on Main Street and
Disneyland and then there's cartoon
Mickey stay in the neck so I think
that's so cute alright so I'm just going
to start on one side and work my way
through so one of the newer things I
bought are these covergirl two naked
palettes now I have the one that's in
the roses and I actually really like it
and it seems that across the board most
people that have tried these tried all
of them out really like the Roses one
more than the other ones like it's more
pigmented it's more blendable but I
wanted to try them for myself because
not everyone has the same skin type and
like if you've got oily eyelids versus
you know dry eyelids or maybe got
veining to cover you don't I mean
there's so many different things that go
into place so I bought the goldens one
which is just you know really pretty
golden colors and then I also bought
nude by the nudes one I love some of
these they're a lot of math but there's
also some beautiful shimmers and let's
just swatch test a couple yeah they're
very very or at least the ones i've
swatched so far crazy pigmented and
buttery but they also kick up powder so
you can see I mean there's like layers
of powder so I mean honestly the easiest
solution to that would just be to tap
your brush off before you actually apply
it it's not that big of a problem as
long as you're aware of it but they're
absolutely gorgeous so let's try a matte
one or two because I'm curious those
were shimmery ones let me try this one
that looks right in the center
a darker one yeah definitely powdering
so okay so this is very very pigmented
but like the lighter one is not as
pigmented um let's see if I can yeah
it's still not super so it's kind of hit
or miss but the one I mean they're still
really buttery I'll have to try them out
let me know now that I do have all three
because I have the Roses one as well if
you'd like a swatch review kind of
comparison video between the three
because I would love to do that let me
know I also picked up some Sonia Kashuk
products I picked up three of her
eyeshadow quads because I feel like I
haven't heard a lot of people talk about
these and I've always been intrigued by
that they all have one shade in them
that's insanely glittery and it's almost
like the chunky little I've ever seen
and so I had to try it
so this quad has a lot of light colors
as you can see and it's in the shade
shimmering sands and another one I got
is called bronze beauty and it's got a
gold chunky glitter one and then it's
just got more bronze II and golden ones
and the last one I bought this time is
called fair and square and it's actually
what I'm wearing on my eyes today mixed
with another palette I'll show you in a
second but I'm wearing the chunky
glitter on my lid here's the thing
there's fallout like crazy in person
there's a mirror here in person there is
a lot of glitter fallout and I was very
careful to like top my brush off and but
it's a lot of fallout so I haven't tried
the other ones the other chunky glitter
shades but they're not like it's mostly
just glitter I don't really know how to
describe it it's like a glitter top coat
almost it's not like it has color with
it but um it's so pretty though I really
like it even still but I'm wearing this
on my lower lash line today this really
pretty like kind of topi bronze again
they're really pigmented but they take
up a lot of powder so it very similar
feel these versus the covergirl ones I
just showed but they're really really
pretty color combinations and that's
what drew me to them and I love that the
packaging is kind of silly
and it's no more packaging than unique
you know what I mean I hate when there's
like half of its the shadows and half of
its like for a brush I hate that so I
really liked that I'll have to try them
out let me know if you'd like to see a
video on them so I bought a lot of new
blushes some that I hadn't heard about
from anyone so I bought all the shades
of the new wet and wild color icon ombre
blushes I have never heard of these so
there are three shades I am actually
wearing on my cheeks this one called the
princess daiquiris and it's just as
gorgeous light peach but of course it
has that ombre effect to a little bit
lighter of a peach it does have a
shimmer to it but it's not glitter it's
just a really pretty kind of satiny
shimmer this is a very kind of light
color of course you can give it up by
going more towards the darker color but
I mean it's not that big of a difference
but I really like the way it appears on
my cheeks anyway the next one I got was
might I like my side to drink might I
buy you a drink that's adorable it's all
chewed up because my beagle Pinocchio
got to it and it was not very happy
literally bought the stuff last night
but this one's a little bit deeper of a
peach it's got a lot more of a punch to
it even though it's still really light
and understated and I'm really drawn
towards blushes that are understated and
I'm realizing that more and more as I
get a little bit older that you know
when a blush is amazingly pigmented like
it's like a bright coral I end up never
reaching for it because I don't like
having to work at making it light and
with something like this I can just
throw it all over my brush and throw it
on and it just looks flawless without
having to think about oh I need to make
sure I get only a little bit or I need
to place it perfectly with these I don't
even have to think about it and I love
that so the last one is called in a
purple haze and it's this really pretty
kind of lilac II lavender oh my gosh I
love shades like that and it's really I
mean it's like almost purplish which
would make sense with the name but it's
so pretty I love these so like I said
I've only tried
the one today I really loved the way it
applied it was like fun to play with you
know what I mean so I already would
recommend these that's been on my face
for about five hours now and I've liked
taking my dog out for walks and stuff
and it's really windy and it stayed on
so I don't know we'll see but I really
really like them there was like spit on
my lip and you guys didn't tell me did
you see it the first thing I bought was
their butter bronzer and I bought it in
the shade light and it says Muru Muru
butter bronzer and it has this amazing
coconut beachy smell it's like they
nailed it it is dead-on
coconut beach period so you know anyone
that's ever been to a beach it will
bring back memories of that it's just a
really light beautiful bronzer it's got
a lot of pigment to it but again it's
light enough where if you get a skin
tone like mine kind of light to medium
it's just gonna look really natural I've
used this I've had this one for a little
bit longer now I've used it probably
four or five times and every time it
just looks beautiful and I love putting
it on because it smells good the
packaging is so cute again it comes with
oh my gosh is so cute a brush oh I
haven't even looked at this I just
assumed it was their normal like brush
it's actually like a spongy thing well
now I want to try it with this I want to
see how to fivesome huh Wow it actually
gets a lot of it up let's see like if it
actually Wow did you guys see that that
was really cool let's see how it blends
it blent okay alright now I want to try
it with this cuz that blends beautifully
oh my gosh so that's pretty cool have no
idea I'm really glad I open that so now
I've got a new way to drive alright the
next thing I got from Physicians Formula
I had to it's their mineral wear cushion
foundation in light now I have the
L'Oreal one and I really like it I've
done a demo I can link below and up
there I really liked it I thought I
would hate it to be honest with you guys
but I actually really liked it when you
applied the correct way with the thing
it comes with it really does look
beautiful but you just have to press it
into your skin and not rub because I
think I was the first few times I try to
apply it I would like rub
Roger you know and it never looked right
but it looks perfect with the cushion so
today I'm actually wearing this and I
use the cushion it comes with and of
course it the packaging again so cute
like it's just really cute it's just so
cute like a little pin cushion and then
you open that and it's got the sponge in
there with the foundation kind of seeped
into it these are new to America they've
been a part of the Asian beauty scene
for like a while now so we're just now
getting to try them so it's always fun
as all the brands try their hand at it
and see but I like it I mean honestly I
think it provided a good amount of
coverage let me know if you'd like a
demo on it alright so I also got three
new pallets from wet and wild and the
palette I mentioned that I was wearing
kind of in conjunction with the Sonia
Kashuk one is this one and it's their
own natural palette and it's in the
shape it says bare necessities and it's
super pigmented so what's amazing about
this palette is you know the other ones
kicked up a lot of dust
this one doesn't at all it's just
perfect absolutely perfect so I mean I
would say that the wet wild ones are at
least this one is better quality than
those Sonia Kashuk ones and the
covergirl ones because it doesn't kick
up a lot of dust let me try the
mountains because some the matte one
cooked up a little bit let me try the
darker matte but not much but they're
still really pigmented so I love finding
good eye shadows like this this is such
an exciting palette because it's very
much like The Naked palette and I'm
thinking about doing maybe a comparison
video let me know
this is really good quality you guys it
blends beautifully I keep reaching for
it over all the new stuff I bought I
reach for this one almost every single
day to use a color too from it here's
the thing that confused me so I bought
this one I think at Walmart and then at
a different Walmart or maybe it was at a
different store I don't know
I found these wet-and-wild palettes and
this one which is called it's the studio
eyeshadow palette in coming in latte
looks awfully similar to this one shade
wise like look at it this way and I
can't figure out like obviously they
have different names but they were I'm
sure the same price they're obviously
the same
brand and just different packaging but
the colors are almost the same not quite
so there's a lot of similar colors but
there are like there's no blue in this
one but the this one the coming in lots
a one comes with like a little brush and
it actually feels pretty decent I've
used it once you can tell because
there's stuff on it and then there's
like kind of a flat pack on kind of
brush really technical term they're a
pack on kind of brush but let's kind of
swatch them these I didn't use these as
much really really really I mean
certainly pigmented they're not kicking
up a lot of dust yet let me try a Mao
and though that's pretty um so the
mountains not as pigmented you can see
but oh my gosh so they're probably the
same shadows to be honest with you guys
which I wouldn't blame them but I'm just
confused about why there's two
completely different so if you know why
like maybe one of these they came out
with and then decide to scratch it and
started the other one or they're just
both being sold to side by side I don't
really get it let me know if you know
but the other one wild one I got is
another studio eyeshadow palette it's in
court center like Sports Center McCord
Center I haven't even opened this one
yet so lega I honestly bought this this
is not a palette I would typically get
for myself just for myself and my own
taste but I wanted to try it for you
guys so I probably will do a video on
these so this one's got a lot of more
like fairy tones and jewel tones well
only a couple lots of purple like almost
too many and lots of darker blacks which
I don't know how different these could
possibly be that would make them yeah
they all look really similar so it has
like four really dark shades they're not
that different I mean there are some
slight differences I mean obviously
there's a variance but it's not enough
we're like almost half of the palette
are these that seems like a lot let's
try that some of the purple tone ones
oops
alright
these again even some of the darker
purple are closer that's really pretty
some of them aren't as pigmented let's
try the two lightest because these are
some interest in color Wow okay swatch
it in a weird place right there so those
are actually really pretty um I just
don't know I almost would say just skip
it because there's not enough fairies
they could have made a quad with a
really nice purple maybe these two light
colors and one of the blacks and called
it a day because I think that's a big
palette for just really like two or
three shade options if you really think
about it but if you know you love that
kind of stuff er you love the smokey eye
and this is something you use then it'd
be awesome for you it just seems like a
lot of the same you know where I haven't
been in a long time the Dollar Tree or
Big Lots I do Dollar Tree hauls all the
time but I have it in awhile because the
dollar trees near where I live now are
not that great so I need to like go near
where I used to live to the ones where I
used to go and get some awesome stuff
but I love doing those videos because I
was finding amazing like Physicians
Formula makeup but I also love going to
Big Lots
I don't know what is making me think of
this I just need to like go that's all
all right let's keep going so oh I had
to get these these are the wet wild
contouring pallets now I used to have
one of these I think it was dulce de
leche now I'm starting to doubt but they
reformulated them and I really liked the
old formula I did a video with them but
these are a little bit more pigmented so
Dolce de leche well look at them side by
side first of all there's obviously like
a yellow almost banana like powder with
this one the bronzer is a little more
reddish tone and deeper in the in a
caramel toffee so let's do dulce de
leche first I'm just going to kind of I
mean they're super pigmented but it's
for a contouring shade I don't get why
both of these are very very warm I feel
like you know to create a true shadow
you wouldn't want it that warm so I
don't really get that or at least why
maybe one of the two palettes aren't you
know one should be maybe more cool gray
and then the other could be warmer if
that's what you want or that would mesh
better with your skin so this is caramel
toffee so it's much deeper and this one
does have a little bit more of a yellow
of course the highlights are harder to
show up but they're both matte which is
nice and I really like using the matte
lighter shades to set my under eye
concealer because it's just really quick
you can just throw a little fluffy brush
in it and put it over and it kind of
sets the area and brightens it as well
so that's how I use those you could also
use it 9 done it from time to time down
like your nose if you wanted to do it
like a cheekbone highlight without any
glitter it would be a little bit lighter
so it worked that way um but yeah so I
like them I don't I just think it's
maybe a little bit more pigmented than
the way it was before but again I just
wish they were more great tones so
here's a product I'm really excited
about I'm wearing this today as well
this is the wet-and-wild mega glow
illuminating palette and it's in catwalk
pink and it's just this unbelievable
it's well it's huge but it's this
unbelievable highlight it's really
really like punch you in the face
highlight so it's super shimmery super
obvious so you do have to use a light
hand but I just love it and I love it
especially because you can swatch all
four colors on their own and they're
totally different shades and I mean
totally different so here they are
swatched here they're so beautiful but
then you can also just swirl your hand
through all four and get this really
beautiful kind of blush tone then if you
swatch this the two lighter colors which
is what I did today you get kind of a
really nice highlight I have that on my
cheekbones right now I just think it is
such an amazing product it's really
really buttery it stays in place all day
you can do so many different things with
it because you can get the separate
colors if you want I just think it's
also beautiful and I love that if you
want you could just use it almost as a
blush since there are those deeper
colors in there as well if you mixed it
and kind of focused it in that area so
this honestly out of everything I bought
is one of my favorite purchases I've
been reaching for it a lot I also picked
up the covergirl trublend face primer
for dry skin and it's actually really
nice I used it today
again I have combo slash dry skin like
it just depends on the time of year but
it's typically more dry especially of
course this time of year and this one
just has those feel to it it has kind of
a slip to it as if it's similar to a
silicon primer but it is more
moisturizing again I used it today
underneath this Physicians Formula one
and I just really like it I like the way
it makes my skin feel look it holds onto
the foundation I've only used a couple
times it's just kind of my first
impressions but I liked it do I think
you need to run out and get it right now
or that it's better than any primer ever
no I think it's just kind of on par with
other primers I've tried the next thing
I actually thought on clearance at
Target for like $5 and these are
originally around 20 this is the Sonia
Kashuk brush and it's the number two
brush and it was listed as a blush brush
which absolutely could be but it's also
thin enough that you could totally use
it and I used today to kind of contour
with if you wanted there's I mean you
can do a million things you could just
highlight with it you could use it for
blush whatever you want but I really
liked it for that I have the number 29
brush for blush which is more like this
shape where it's more just a circle and
I love them I love the handles where it
just feels comfortable to hold they're
just cute and simple and pretty and I
love them I want to buy like every
single one but I only have this one and
the number 29 I love them I got another
brush this was from ELF this is their
flawless concealer brush and I cannot
remember if I already own this or not I
want to say that I have but it looked a
little bigger than I remembered it I
don't know but again this is the perfect
fluffy brush to use like for that for
like the lighter shade in here you could
just get some of the powder on there and
just dust it in this area and go down
your nose if you want it's the perfect
size and shape they're really really
soft these are around $3 from ELF and I
I'm just excited I got this lip product
from Rimmel and it's they're the one or
you know the only one lipstick and I got
it in the shade 200 it's a keeper and I
seeing the shade in store I was like oh
my gosh I'm so excited that looks
exactly like something I would love but
it's really moisturizing which is not a
bad thing but it doesn't look as good as
I thought
my lips so I literally worn it once so
I'm certainly going to try it and that's
not my final thoughts on this but it has
a very strong smell like enough that it
almost makes me sick to my stomach and
I'm not really sensitive smell so if you
are stay far far away from these um it's
kind of like a fake plasticky fruit
smell i I can't think of another way to
describe it I don't I don't know it's
just really strong but the color is
beautiful it's just got kind of like
that lustrous finish that doesn't always
look good on my lips so again I'll keep
trying it if you have another shade
you've tried that you really really like
let me know below because I'd be willing
to try another one to see if it's just
the whole like line that I wouldn't like
or if it's just this shade I also bought
the number 7 I'm kind of out of boots
number 7 kick as you might know and I've
just been buying a lot of things to
prepare for a video I want to do just
about their line because I feel like no
one talks about it at least here in the
States
so this is their lash + brow Perfector
and it looks like I haven't used it yet
it's just a clear brow gel but I love
how tiny the brush is so when you're
brushing through your brows you can
actually pinpoint where you want it I
hate like I've tried the is it
Maybelline I think where they have a new
clear brow gel out but the brush is so
big and then it's like it's too big I'm
like I'm just putting brow gel all over
like my forehead with that brush so I
love that this is small but I haven't
tried it yet I'm excited although I will
tell you right now this is going to be
like gross and brown in like three weeks
because that is what happens alright
another thing from boots number 7 I'm
wearing today this is their number 7
precision lips pencil precision lips
pencil I guess um what is the shade
Jessica
nude Oh perfect and I'm wearing this
obviously on the outer portion of my
lips and then the lipstick I'm wearing
is actually a YSL one sub Rouge beloved
in number 1 which actually this is much
lighter than this is which you might be
able to tell but I kind of like the way
that looks um but it's just a
retractable pencil really creamy and
just kind of that perfect brown nude I
don't have one this shade too more cheek
products then three more No
Pasha's and a mascara so I bought a nyx
HD blush in nude tude and in the store I
couldn't tell if it'd be like a blush or
bronzer for me so I bought it thinking
it'd be a bronzer but honestly it's kind
of a really pretty like simple blush
well or maybe like a contour blush in
one because it's kind of peachy and
that's one of those shades that you
could kind of like tart exposed where
you can just put it almost in the
contour region and as your blush kind of
as an all-in-one without doing two
separate steps and I do kind of light
shades like that so and I've liked the
formula again these kick up a lot of
powder because they're really pigmented
but they seem to stay in place pretty
well so so the only other cheek product
I got was from wet and wild it's one of
their new shades from their color icon
they also redid the packaging so it's
not as like like they they used to have
a pan that was like really really big
and so now it's really small which is
awesome but this is called rosacea
champagne and it's one of their new
shades and it's just a really simple
peach but it does have kind of a golden
shimmer to it but it's not glitter it's
just really nice so I'm excited to wear
that s'more I also got three nail
polishes so the first brand I was
wanting to try because this is new is
the one wild one-step wonder gels and I
got the shade part of my peach which is
like a neon peach I thought it was just
peach know it's like neon so this one
I'm going to try like for a toenail
color in the summer I think that'd be
really pretty but the other one is a
light pink called pinky swear and I
tried this without anything else since I
said it's one-step like it's supposed to
be just it's going to be the primer it's
going to be the color it's going to be
the topcoat etc no light needed as well
and so I tried this and it kind of
peeled off pretty quickly or it chipped
and then parts of it peeled Mike oh my
gosh forget it so I don't know if it's
just the Shay you don't have to try the
other one to see maybe it's just this
color I don't know the other nail polish
I literally bought yesterday is the
Sally Hansen miracle gel one of my
favorite lines of nail polish called
throwing shade and it's just this really
pretty kind of muted lavender and I just
I'm obsessed with this color it's my
favorite color just in general
has been for a couple years so I'm
always excited to see nail polish
versions of it I love it so and I love
that line of nail polish is if you've
never tried that line you have to
they're amazing they stay on for so long
and they're just they have such a
beautiful range of colors the last
product I got I think is this is
actually the only one I didn't buy this
one was sent to me from Revlon and I was
like oh but I haven't tried it yet so
and I don't have to show it but I like
to share what people send to me just so
you can see what I might be trying out
this is the Revlon ultimate all-in-one
mascara
claims are says high-impact formula
delivers the ultimate five benefits in
one volume length definition lifts and
rich intense color okay so the brush it
says it's their power mini brush unique
mini oval shape for easy application
hollow-core is designed to deposit
formula for mega lash impact manga lash
oh so the packaging it's like matte
black like you can even feel it's
absolutely matte and then this is kind
of like lacquered I think that's kind of
fun so it is tiny oh my gosh I am so
cure at night like there's no oh my gosh
I am so excited to try this out so I
might be doing a video on this one
because I'm just said I've never seen
one quite like this so that is really
fun and I think that is everything I'm
going to share with you guys today I
feel like there are a couple things I'm
forgetting that I've been using but if I
