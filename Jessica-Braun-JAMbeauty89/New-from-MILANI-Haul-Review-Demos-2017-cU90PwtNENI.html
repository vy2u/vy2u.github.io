to share with you guys a Milani haul
flash besten worth of some new products
that are out I've been trying these out
for a little while so I do have some
feelings about them and I'm excited to
share them with you so what one get into
it there's so many goodies like I almost
don't know what to be and also this
shirt is from Target isn't it so awesome
I love it so much like the shoulder
thing it's been around for well but it's
got like little bell sleeves oh I love
it
anyway if I can find it on target
website link below okay first of all
before we get into anything I'm going to
tell you what I'm wearing on my lips
it's not a Milani product it's from my
wet and wild stash of things that I just
filmed about it's their liquid cat suit
in Missy and fears I'm also wearing
their gel lip liner in red 15 so I just
paired those together and it's like not
going anywhere it's pretty pretty good
so if that video is up where I talk
about the best mores of wet and wild to
new stuff I'll link that below all right
no more plugs just stop let's start with
the most balm products that Milani has
ever made ever ever ever and you've
probably already heard about it but I'm
going to tell you anyway
it's the Milani make it last setting
spray this stuff I could use all day
long over and over again and what's
weird is that a lot of people say it's
like the mac's fix+
I totally agree but this meses smell
that I love and usually you know I don't
love to have fragrance and things just
because it can sometimes irritate skin
and it set me other but I love the smell
of this stuff and I think it's very
similar to mac fix+ they both have
glycerin I used it today when I was
doing my eye makeup look to spray on
eyeshadow to make it a little bit more
pigmented on my lid but I also use it
just to set my entire face and it does
such an amazing job of taking your
foundation and powder and blush and
everything and just kind of melding it
all into one mask and I love it it's so
comfortable it dries quickly it doesn't
leave weird splotchy wet marks I tried
some products where the sprayer stinks
this sprayer is so good
oh my gosh it is so all in the smell is
so wonderful and almost I will say it
kind of has like a I just region in
it kind of has like a hairsprayy smell
but like in a good way I don't know how
else to describe this hairspray bothers
you you might not like it but oh and
here's the thing I I don't use studies
for every day but the day I bought this
and tried it I've used it every day
since so it's been a couple weeks this
I've never used this much setting spray
in like two weeks
ever in my life like I will end up going
through this in the next two months and
buying it again it is amazing in the
packaging is cute next thing I use on my
cheeks today this is the Milani prime
light at the prettiest packaging face
primer says it's strobing and pore
minimizing i 100% disagree that it is
pore minimizing and totally don't agree
with that claim that's my own skin but i
don't put something shiny i don't like
putting things other than like on the
tip of my nose i don't like putting
primers like this on my nose so i'll
usually use like my milk make a blur
stick that i totally love and use
literally every day i use it on my nose
only and like maybe right here
everywhere else i put this on today this
stuff is so much like the mac strobe
cream let me show you i'll close there
this is the mac strobe cream and i just
have the smaller one let me get it on my
other hand so it's like a white cream
you know i'm not going to blend it in
all the way yet just so you can really
see so here's the Milani one also a
white cream okay they are so so similar
I would say the only difference is the
Mac strobe cream kind of has like a
pinkish hint to it while this one kind
of has more of a home assay stage but
kind of a beige I think I like the
Milani ones better
isn't that awesome I like I genuinely
think I like it better it's just it
blends in really quickly and now I'm
just mixing the whole thing together it
doesn't matter
they're like the exact same product
there it's comfortable it hasn't broken
me out or anything like that I just put
it kind of in this region and on my
forehead and you can kind of see like I
feel like my skin has life to it and
even if I didn't have highlighter on it
would still look I don't want
say glowy but just kind of lit from
within just alive if you've never tried
a product like this and you kind of
think like no way like I'm going to be
putting stuff on top of it it's not
going to make a difference it really
does make a difference it's worth trying
and I would totally say go for the
Milani one honestly price-wise these are
probably for this Mac size versus
they're probably about the same price
but I still would say go for the Milani
one I love it the Milani retouch any
race concealer is so good now today I
didn't use it because I was also trying
out the wet and wild stuff which I also
like I think I like this Milani one
better than the wet and wild photo focus
concealer and I really liked it but this
one is so like creamy and just gorgeous
like it's one of those concealers that
every time I use it I'm like yes like I
love blending it in it should so smooth
and comfortable now the packaging is
interesting because it's like a soft
little sponge like thing probably not
super sanitary however I have a feeling
I'm going to fly through this you could
totally rip off the sponge I don't
really mind the sponge I just don't I
know some people do but anyway you
squeeze it up through there and honestly
what I've been doing I don't really
apply it with a sponge anyway I apply it
onto my finger but it's just this really
comfortable concealer it's got great
coverage in a way now that I like
thinking thinking about it it really
does remind me of the Tarte shaped eight
maybe not this I think might be easier
to blend but it's got really similar
coverage I not saying they're dupes I
don't think they're dudes but this like
I'm enjoying both of those so much and
I've been going so back and forth and I
feel like I don't really notice the
difference at the end result no matter
which one I'm using does that make sense
I love this stuff if you're if you're
kind of in a concealer rut are you just
wanting something new totally go try
this if you can find your shade it's one
of the biggest problems is they don't
have a lot of shades
I have zero one fair and it is decently
light but it's not super light so if
you're any paler than me
I think it'll still work but I mean
there are certainly lighter concealers
out in the world but
so the next product is this Milani
stay-put waterproof eyeliner pencil
these look just like the urban decay
pencils and rip liners and things like
that because the cap has this little
bump out and to me there's something so
weirdly satisfying about it like I don't
know why but I love it someone else out
there I'm sure is watching this and is
thinking yeah I like that packaging too
anyway and of course I like the gold
this stuff is amazing Milani makes great
eyeliner as it is but this is just
really really really creamy really black
I used it today it stays in your
waterline like it says it's waterproof
totally agree
this is probably no this is my favorite
drugstore eyeliner I'm just I'm putting
it out there it's my favorite black
pencil liner that quickly it dethroned I
don't see I don't even know what else
I've liked I feel like I have all
between so many different ones this is
the best I've tried it is amazing next
product so the next products are these
Milani luxe lip treatments first of all
the smell of these is the most amazing
smell I it's like vanilla but it's like
so sweet I love it so this is the keep
it sweet sugar lip scrub and so this
stuff is a literal scrub but it's like
in a bomb and so it's so so oh can you
hear it
it's that sugary crunch but it's so good
at exfoliating your lips
I've been trying out the lip scent
things and I'm still kind of trying it
out before I give my feelings on it but
this was so nice after that to use
something like this and then the other
product is to keep it smooth left lips
treatment it's like a lip balm this
stuff same exact smell it's very thin
though it kind of took me by surprise
how thin this is and until you try it I
don't know any I've never tried anything
quite like this I love it though it's
really thin but it's the perfect thing
to slap on my list as I'm getting ready
in the morning and it just kind of
smooths it
adds a little bit of moisture and then
my lips are ready to go for whatever I'm
going to put on them for the day
I love these I think Milani is like
freaking blue and everyone out of the
water when it comes to their packaging
their ideas their products everything
like they're just coming I don't want to
say they're coming out of nowhere but
they're kind of coming out of nowhere
and like doing everything better than
anyone else so and I think the packaging
of these is cute I love them these are
products that I will definitely use up
and will definitely repurchase again and
again all right the last Milani product
is their color statement lip liner in
the shade nude this is the only product
that I can't I want to say it kind of
disappointed me and the only reason let
me wipe off like all this adjust that
sugar scrub on my hand and I don't want
to say it's disappointing it's not a bad
product but it was the only one that I
was like uh-huh
because it's still a pencil lip liner
and honestly and this is so shallow I'm
telling you right now I just wish it
were retractable I am so lazy and like
for me we travel so much and I love this
color and this formula so much I just
wish that I didn't have to sharpen it
right like when I travel I don't usually
bring a sharpener I'll usually bring a
retractable eyeliner retractable lip
liner things that I don't have to worry
about because it's one less thing I need
to worry about and like I said I know
how shallow that sounds that's my only
gripe but this product is really really
good the color is nude it's really
creamy and frankly for a pencil eyeliner
I feel like this is like one of the only
pencils I say eyeliner metal lip liner
for a pencil lip liner that you have to
sharpen this is incredibly creamy most
pencil lip liners I feel like are so dry
you got to warm them up you never have
to warm this up so really my complaints
don't even count because this product is
so good there's a reason so many people
love this this one's not new from their
line it's just one that I think I had a
long time ago and at some point I
declared it but then I missed it and I
was like I want it back so those were
all of the mostly new from Milani
products best and worse but really the
worst was still amazing so it is what it
is but I love all of this stuff
