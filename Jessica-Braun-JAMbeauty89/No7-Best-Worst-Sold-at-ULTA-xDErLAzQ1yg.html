a number 7
best and worst so I've been doing a lot
of these kind of whole brand bests and
worst types of videos and I just enjoyed
them and I know a lot of you guys enjoy
them and I have been asked to do the
brand number 7 for quite some time
because I've been using their products
for a couple of years now and there are
some products that are my absolute Holy
Grail favorites and then there are some
other ones that I just kind of feel mad
about so let's go and get into it
so the first thing that comes to mind
when I think of number 7 is one of my
favorite products of all time and that
would be the number 7 stay perfect
foundation this they say it's medium
coverage like it literally says it on
the bottle I would say you can
absolutely build it up to like medium
full now when I think a full coverage
foundation I think of like those really
thick foundations that you can tell
you're wearing it but it definitely
covers anything and that is almost never
my cup of tea so the max I go is like a
medium medium full and this is totally
it looks beautiful with the brush but it
looks best with some kind of a beauty
sponge I just love this stuff it's like
it has a pump it's got a nice glass
bottle I buy my number 7 products at
Target but you can get them all over the
place I'll link any of the products I
mentioned down below if you're wanting
to check them out online it has SPF of
15 and it is very long wearing but
what's crazy is most long wearing
foundations that I've tried just kind of
look horrible on the skin like either
you can just tell like you're wearing a
lot or they just I don't know they I
just feel like I'm wearing a ton but
this stuff looks healthy on the skin and
yet it stays all day long I've even worn
this without primer and it still stays
I've used it with tons of different
primers I mean it's just no matter how
you wear it it ends up looking beautiful
so I have tried all the shades that
would be anywhere close to me and I
cannot find the right one so I kind of
mix and match different shades right now
although I've been wearing warm ivory
and it seems to match pretty well but I
love this stuff I think the finish of it
is kind of a satin finish I don't think
it's dewy by any means but it's
definitely not totally matte it's that
perfect in between where your skin looks
healthy but it doesn't look greasy and
that is why I love it
just now realize there's a mirror-like
in the way sorry that would have driven
me crazy while I was editing this let's
talk about some products that are just
okay these are their eyeshadow trios
they're what do they call them they're
stay perfect eyes shadow palettes so
we've got golden sands which has this
black and then this cream in like a
shimmery champagne then they have this
one called sugarplum and it's got like
just some deeper shades and a lighter
and they're all three kind of shimmery
and then this one called warm nudes and
it's got like a deep kind of purple at
op1 and then again another champagne
shimmery color the thing about these
shades or not really the shades but the
little trios is I just don't like like
the shape of them like I would much
rather just be a normal like side by
side by side or I don't know and I think
they used to do ones like that I feel
like I remember having one that I did
like the shadows themselves however the
most important part aren't bad they're
certainly pigmented I wish there were
more mats because I think every no they
have one matte in this trio here and
it's like the beige and it's it's good I
mean there the formula does seem to be
pretty good they blend pretty well
they're pigmented like I said but I
don't know I just I felt underwhelmed by
these not because they're a bad product
because they're not but just because I
didn't love the the shape of the shadows
and getting my brush in there and things
like that just felt kind of clunky and
awkward but just that you know I don't
know they're okay I feel like for the
money you'd spend on this even though
yes it is more drugstore priced I think
that you could go for like the covergirl
true nakeds where even if every single
shade isn't amazing you're getting a lot
more for around the same price depending
on where you go or you can get like one
of those wet-and-wild trios things like
that so I think that was why I felt
underwhelmed because I know there are so
many good shadows at the drugstore and
well oh and while these aren't bad they
were just kind of met but with that
being said if you found a trio like I
think my favorite out of them is the
warm nudes because it does have three
really pretty colors but again there's
no matte in here so
I feel like I have to pull from
something else so trios are just tricky
they're tricky to get shades together
that you could do a whole look with and
then you've also got to think of not
just the shades but also the finish of
it so anyway next thing is their blush I
my favorite the one I'm wearing today is
in peach velvet and it's just this
really pretty actually wearable peach
these are powder blushes they're nice
and pigmented some of them are like woah
like this one is damson mist and it is a
true bright bright so I feel like if you
had a deeper skin tone that might look
gorgeous on you on me it doesn't it just
doesn't work with my skin tone but if
you have one similar to mine I think
you'd really like peach velvet it's just
pretty these are I feel like a thinner
blush they're still pigmented as you can
see but they're almost a thinner powder
and so I feel like they stay on your
skin better it's like it's like the
primer and foundation underneath it like
hold on to it better whereas other ones
that you know if you've had a blush that
you kind of stick your finger and you're
like holy moly like it's like a thick
almost eyeshadow like texture
sometimes those can be really hard to
work with because they can be a lot the
first time you apply it and I feel like
they don't always wear as well
throughout the day but these I've never
noticed any wear time issues with them
and I really like them I think the
packaging is simple but really cute
that's kind of what number seven you
know a lot of the packaging looks like
this just simple they always have kind
of an ovule err oval type shape you know
and I like it I like that there's not a
ton of wasted pan either so definitely a
jam beauty 89 approved product okay
another face product that really I think
I've had for so long I need to replace
it's the number seven lift and
illuminate foundation this is SPF 15
this is much less coverage than this so
like if that's what you need you want
stay perfect but this I'm
it today but I do have a powder
foundation on top right now because it
doesn't have a lot of coverage but I
wear this to work all the time because
it's just a comfortable foundation to
wear it does have a little bit of SPF
it's only 15 so it's not like as much as
you need if you're gonna be out all day
long but it's comfortable it makes your
skin look really healthy your skin can
breathe but it doesn't look like you're
not wearing anything so it is a step
above just a plain old tinted
moisturizer but it's definitely not high
coverage but it's comfortable I think it
does throughout the day kind of break
apart on your nose a little bit if you
have skin like mine I can't keep
anything on my nose but it's just a good
comfortable like I feel like this is one
of my favorite tinted moisturizer like
products because I do feel like it wears
a little bit longer it has a little bit
more coverage and I like that it's got
the pump packaging so I just I like that
it's kind of foundation like packaging
even though it really is not a
foundation it's more like a tinted
moisturizer BB cream kind of a product
the next product i wanted to talk about
is the number 7 - lip glosses i have two
shades here i have this kind of more
neutral one which is called naturally
nude and then the really red one is
called roaring red now i think this is a
great lip gloss formula i really do
because it doesn't have a noticeable
smell and i've never noticed on my lips
no there's no noticeable smell I like
that the DOE foot applicator has got
that flattened doe foot which I just for
whatever reason really liked the NARS
lip glosses that I really really like
they're new like Velvet Matte ones those
have that same kind of doe foot and I
just like it it's an enjoyable way to
apply it I don't know why but I really I
like the nude one a lot more than the
red and really it's only a preference
thing I don't like wearing a bright
color like this in a gloss form because
I feel like it just gets messy if I'm
wanting a bright red I like to use
something that is gonna stay where it is
and not move because I don't have to
worry about it being you know like all
the way up my face outside my lips but
formula wise I do think it's a good lip
gloss formula do I think it's like
something that's gonna change your life
no I don't feel that way about lip gloss
very often because lip gloss you know
across the board they're very similar I
don't think these are over
sticky at all but you know they do have
a little bit of stick to them but
nothing that's gonna drive you crazy in
my opinion it's just a lip gloss you
know so if you found a shade you really
really liked in this range I would never
say not to get it because I think
they're good but like I've said before
it's just a lip gloss um yeah I don't
really know what else to say about lip
gloss oftentimes because unless they're
like crazy like they just feel crazy on
your lips then you know they all look
glossy they all kind of wear the same
way so it's nice that there's no
offensive smell and of course you know I
really do like that nude shade Oh next
up there's so many favorites I can't
believe sometimes when I look at how
many number seven products I look I've
tried I'm like me in like I really do
like this brand so this is their radiant
glow concealer I've been talking about
this stuff for years I've gone through
maybe three or four of these and I
already have a backup of this it's this
is better than like the YSL Touche clot
I can show you and I don't hate the YSL
Touche clot I feel like I talk about
this all the time and I'm like you know
it's okay and it is okay I've traveled
with it I like it enough so this is the
YSL here it's just a very kind of sheer
brightening concealer it's not really
meant to conceal a bunch it's more there
to brighten and conceal a little well
they have the same kind of an applicator
you know that why I sell ones goal this
one's silver and it is a little bit
thinner they both have 2.5 milliliters
of product so there's the same number of
amount of product but I just feel like
this number 7 one kit does conceal a
little bit more it's a little bit
thicker not I mean I mean it is
noticeable it's just a little bit
thicker and I think because of that and
it must have a little bit more pigment
to it it just conceals so well and it
brightens so I feel like I have
concealers that can seal really well and
then I have brightening ones but it's
very rare to find a concealer that
really does both and with this stuff I
can apply it to that area and my inner
corner and all of that and just tap my
finger and it just blends right in and I
don't have to go in with a brush and a
sponge and all this stuff and oh no I
it looks crepey it never looks crepey it
is just a beautiful concealer so if you
if any
that sounds like it's up your alley you
should check this stuff out I've been
talking about it for years for a reason
could possibly be like my favorite
number seven product that's hard to say
because I really love to stay perfect
but I mean it's like they're both like
neck-and-neck for number one for getting
all right let's talk about another
favorite they're freaking bronzers I'm
wearing the one in the shade caramel
today and this is actually deeper than
the one I'm used to using and I'm used
to using golden sand but you can kind of
see the shade difference here golden
sand like if you've got light skin it
reminds me of the Too Faced milk
chocolate bronzer because it's that
lighter shade for lighter skin but
caramel is definitely more like orange
but it's still a wearable Orange and
like I said I'm wearing today up here
and here I just feel like these both
make your skin look healthy they're not
overly mattes where it looks like weird
but they're not overly shimmery where
you feel weird putting it in those spots
if that makes sense so they've kind of
got this satin finish to them they're
pigmented enough to really show up in
the right way but they're not so
pigmented that you feel like you're
putting eyeshadow all over your face the
golden sand it's really hard for me to
get a swatch to show up because it's so
close to my skin tone which is why I
kind of jumped up to the caramel but you
can see caramel golden sand is next to
it but it's hard to see but there's
caramel I just love them what I love is
that when I apply it with a brush to
those areas you know I can grab a sponge
and it just kind of go over it and it
really blends it in more seamlessly I
just love these I think the packaging is
also pretty they have this pretty design
on the actual powder I just everything
about this bronzer is wonderful next
thing I'm going to talk about are their
moisture drench lipsticks so the ones
that look like this I have a few shades
I have honey bloom which is an amazing
everyday color it's kind of a dusty pink
I love this color they have the number 7
little emblem engraved I feel like
that's not the right word but anyway it
kind of itched into the side of the
lipstick which i think is so classy
especially for a technically drugstore
brand although
I've kind of talked about this kind of
like a medium because I feel like it's
kind of in between anyway I also the
shade berry blush and actually I've
never worn this shade
I've only swatched it but it's really
pretty like really really pretty and
it's totally one of those fall shades
and then the other shade I have is
romantic I've had this one for over a
year now and it's more of a warm toned
pink compared to the first one i
swatched but these are very comfortable
classic lipsticks for me I've been
reaching for lipsticks more like this
more often lately because I feel like my
lips are so tired of the matte lip trend
and I'm not totally into the metallic
lip trend either so I'm kind of just
reaching more for these classic
comfortable lipsticks where they're not
matte they're just kind of a satin kind
of creamy finish comfortable to wear yes
you have to reapply them throughout the
day and you do with these as well but I
don't mind that when at least my lips
aren't feeling like they're completely
dried out and uncomfortable so this
makes me want to wear lipstick more
often whereas with the matte stuff I'd
do it like once or twice a week because
of like my lips can't handle it you know
no matter how much I exfoliate
moisturize and all that my lips just
can't handle it
and I'm sure I'm not alone on that of
course that's been talking about these
I'm wearing a Revlon lipstick but um I'm
wearing if you're curious the Revlon
Super Lustrous lipstick and bombshell
red it's just a really pretty almost
berry like red but I really like that
too
very similar formula but I highly
recommend these number-7 lipsticks like
I said the shade honey bloom and
romantic if you were to buy like two you
could buy these two they're on the edge
and those are like the perfect everyday
colors perfect you don't need a lip
liner with them they just look healthy
on your lips they've got enough pigment
to look like you're wearing lipstick but
not so much that you're gonna be
concerned all day long that it's like
all outside your lip line kind of like
the color I'm wearing today so the other
lip products they have that I've try are
they're stay perfect lip colors and
these they're a different packaging all
together these are longer and more
slender and they have a different you
know it's one of these kind of where the
bullet comes all the way up and it's
almost like the lipsticks a part of the
bullet
these are
I think they have more pigment to them
and they're not matte but they're these
are hard to describe they have a similar
formula but these like glide right on
like they're crazy creamy and when I
first tried these when I read the term
stay perfect I thought it would be like
more like kind of a mattifying type of a
finish where it would like stay put all
day but these have this like slip to
them that you just like like glides
right on and so I feel like the name is
misleading not I don't know anyway but
so the shades I just swatch this is
cinnamon spice right here and then the
more pinky tone one is called dark berry
let me wipe off my weird swatch here
okay so now we're back to just the two
so I don't see a huge huge difference
between the moisture drench ones that I
showed before this and these stay
perfect ones like I said I think they do
stay in place a little bit better cuz
while they do have this lip they kind of
set in their own way and look more
satiny and because it's such a thin
formula it you don't need as much to get
the same amount of pigment so it kind of
just depends on what you like I do think
the slip is a little odd and so I don't
applying them it's just weird and I do
feel like I need a lip liner with these
because you know you can easily slip and
it's gonna be all over your face because
it's just that glide II and creamy so I
think these are good but I do think I
like the moisture drench ones better the
next product is one of their tinted
moisturizers and it's called City Light
tinted moisturizer it has SPF of 15 this
is the shade medium I think this is a
pretty good tinted moisturizer it
definitely got that kind of sunscreen
feel to it like a lot of them do it's a
lot you know thinner of a formula and it
has some coverage but not a lot I mean
certainly their lift and luminate has
more coverage than this and they have
the same amount of SPF so for me I would
rather and I often reach for this one
over this one again tinted moisturizers
just aren't my jam there's not enough
coverage in them for my everyday so
anytime I do wear this I almost always
put a powder foundation over it just
because I feel like I look a little bit
greasy because
Sun screen and the products in it and
yeah so I think if you have dry dry dry
skin you might like this because it
definitely moisturizes but I just feel
like it's almost too oily for my skin
and I don't have oil II skin so you know
it's kind of my two cents like I said
I'm not the person to ask about tinted
moisturizer because it's just not my
favorite kind of a product so if you've
tried this and you are like a tinted
moisturizer connoisseur like you've
tried tons if this is one of the better
ones or one of the worst ones please let
us know down below I need to get more
into that world to understand it better
but I know for a lot of people that
don't like a lot of coverage I mean
tinted moisturizer is it so let me know
how you guys like this one below I wish
I could give more I wish I had more to
say about it but I just really don't
I've you know the times I've worn it
it's just okay now I would rather wear
something like this than just sunscreen
like if I'm going out to maybe do some
gardening or you know whatever I don't
really garden I want to get more into it
now that we have a house but anyway but
let's pretend in my dream world I'm a
gardener well if I'm going out to do
gardening and I'm not necessarily gonna
put makeup on I would rather wear this
where I have a little bit of coverage
versus just a sunscreen so and of course
this is something with sunscreen that is
meant for your face whereas I feel like
I've put body sunscreens on my face and
my face would break out so that's one
benefit to it anyway I'll stop talking
about it so those are all of the number
seven products that I currently own I've
owned other ones in the past that I've
maybe decluttered whatever but for the
most part I've kept most of them I hope
that these many reviews made sense to
you if you like these kinds of brand
bests and worse videos definitely give
it a thumbs up I've also done a NYX best
in worst I will link below I've done a
flower beauty bests and worse and elf
best and worst in a wet and wild
although the wet and wild one I need to
update because it was kind of a year ago
and I rewatched that video recently and
I was like I looked crazy my makeup
looked crazy in that video anyway so I
hope that you'll subscribe and I will
see you guys in my next video bye guys
