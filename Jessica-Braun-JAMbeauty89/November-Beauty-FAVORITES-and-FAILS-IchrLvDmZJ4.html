have my November favorites and sorry I
look like I'm well I don't like to look
bad but I just came from rehearsals so
I'm in like comfy workout II Dancy
clothes so that's why but I did throw a
lipgloss for you guys to dial it anyway
so I have a ton of favorites for you
guys that I have some products that I've
been kind of not liking as well which
are always fun to see so you clearly
have a lot of energy I've been drinking
coffee which is like right next to my
camera and I've been dancing all day so
I'm just kind of like on like a high
right now so speaking of I'm in a show
right now and I can link I don't think
many of you live near me but if you do
live in or near Indianapolis I will link
the information for the show that I'm in
down below it's a lot of fun it's a
children's show based on if you know the
stories of Frog and Toad like from when
you were a kid which I loved them when I
was a kid and this is the third year
that I've done this musical and it's so
fun and I stand and dance and act of
course and it's just a lot of fun so if
you're interested and you live nearby
I'll link it down below anyway so on to
my favorites so the one I'm gonna start
with is not a makeup favorite but it's
just I can't stop wearing it and it's
this scarf that I got from shop lately
calm I'll link it down below because
it's like it's been my favorite site if
you go back oh man if you go back on my
like earlier earlier videos from when I
first started earlier this year really
um I've just been addicted this site for
a year basically and they'd have
accessories and jewelry now they have
like and I hadn't been on the website
and like probably a couple months and I
just recently been back on and they have
clothes now and they've got makeup Nick
Bullock whoa so they've kind of exploded
but basically it's a bunch of different
sellers and this one I think was from
glint and gleam but this look at this
scarf okay
it just is seemingly normal to like
light and fluffy but it's kind of it can
get really thick which is kind of nice
but what I love about it is it's got
animal print but then it's got these
like neon hearts on it splash all over
so when it's all bundled up it just
looks like a mess with like neon pink
it's so pretty oh I love it but it was
great is it's great for like spring and
summer but it's also thick enough that
it works for fall in winter as well so I
can't stop wearing it because all of my
coats are kind of more muted except for
my favorite coat but the other coats I
have are more muted color so this is
just such a fun pop and it looks great
just alone as well so I love that and I
like i said i'll link that button below
I'm gushing calm down Jess okay so I'm
gonna start with a product that I've not
been liking and this one is the Revlon
Colorstay pressed powder and I don't I
don't like the packaging it's just I
mean it's okay but it opens and when you
open a little fart does that which a lot
of Physicians Formula One's do too and I
don't know why that bothers me but it
does so it does that and there's just
rubbing my finger against it bothered me
it's so it's pretty pigmented but it's
marketed as a pressed powder not as a
powder foundation pin I don't know why I
don't it's like nails on a chalkboard
when I do that I don't know what it is
about this I don't like but it certainly
makes you look cakey no matter what
brush I've used with it I usually have
to use like a dewy typesetting spray
which I don't like to use because my
skin's not like I mean my skin gets a
little oily so I can't find a way to use
this product honestly so I really don't
like it and I pulled it out and tried to
use it again and I still don't like it
so that's that okay another favorite now
that it's wintery outside at least where
I live I've pulled out my L'Occitane
L'Occitane however you say it just hand
cream and this is just in their like
original scent so it's not really
sentient but what's amazing these are
kind of pricey for the size however I've
had this now this is my second winter
with it and it lasts a long time because
you only need a little bit and then it
is the creamiest thing especially for
your cuticles if you get really dry
cuticles which I do during this time of
year and just dry hands it is amazing
you put it on it's so luxurious and it
just I don't know
okay this reminded me by the way so I
just discovered this website and I don't
know how it took me this long but it's
called ebates.com
and I've been messing around with it and
basically this website you make money
shopping online and I'm not even kidding
you and when I first heard of it
like no there's got to be a catch
there's no catch
as long as before you shop every single
time you go to Ebates and make sure
you're logged into your own account that
you create then like say I'm wanting to
stop shop on sephora.com I think right
now they have eight or ten percent back
cashback so if I were wanting to shop us
before I go to Ebates
then I click on the Sephora link and
they are like literally hundreds of
thousands of websites that they do this
with so then I go to Sephora calm just
through that and then it's regular sport
I call my shop purchase it then it will
give me say ten percent cashback if I
spent 50 bucks I get five dollars back
in an account on eBay's then you just
get that money back whenever you want so
it's like literally cashback it's insane
so I've just been doing a lot of my
Christmas shopping through there I'm
getting money back just into my pocket
it's amazing so I'll link it down below
because I thought it was a joke
it's I'm seriously actually getting
money in my account so it's really
really neat so that was completely
decide to a point Wow oh okay another
product I've been loving the covergirl
clump crusher I can't stop using it and
I just like it because I don't have to
think about it when I put it on in the
morning I don't have to like maneuver it
so that I don't get clumps or so that it
doesn't get crazy I can just put it on
as much as I want it's got this rubbery
you know bristle brush and it's amazing
it's just so no fuss you don't have to
think about you can layer 15 layers and
it's just not gonna clump it's fantastic
and I like it cuz you can touch up with
it later in the day and it also doesn't
clump like after rehearsal before I just
started filming this I did a little bit
more on it and it didn't clump up or
anything I loved it this is gonna be a
long video fair warning hello also by
the way you guys have to I know I keep
showing you guys my coffee mugs but
they're all so cute look at this one
it's got did I show you this one I don't
think so it's got Mickey and Donald and
everything my parents got me this they
sell these at Big Lots for like $4 I get
all my cute Christmas mugs from there
all my Disney modes really and if you
don't have a big lots near you that
really stinks I'm sorry cuz I know I
talk about a lot anyway okay another
product I did not like and I go back and
forth with this one it's the Neutrogena
healthy skin brightening eye for
factor and I love the way I love the
packaging I love that it's I can't even
open it seriously there we go I love
that it's a brush tip applicator and you
just you know put it there
but it it makes my eyes burn and I don't
get it in my eyes because I've used this
so many times and every time I'm more
and more careful but it literally makes
my eyes and the skin around it burn and
it's done it since the first time I use
it so I don't really I don't understand
it but I like it the coverage is okay I
actually wore it today because I wanted
to see but it's just not my favorite and
I wouldn't repurchase it so if you're
thinking about it I would say just stay
away because I've never had something
burn my eyes but this does it's very
bizarre
so okay products I've been loving and I
rediscovered okay my Beauty Blender is
on the fridge I threw it out because I
it had been a while and I'd like not
cleaned it in a couple days and then I
did that again and it was just I was
like you know what I feel like bacteria
is growing on this I know that's weird
but that's how I felt so I just threw it
away
consequently I'm getting a free one in
my Ipsy bag because of if see points
which is awesome that will be linked
below there's gonna be about ten links
below you guys anyway so I'm getting a
free Beauty Blender with my next empty
bag so that's good in the meantime I
pulled out my Sigma what is it the F 84
brush that I used to use for foundation
oh my gosh this is amazing I completely
forgot this is the most luxurious brush
I want to say this is only like $14
again I'll link these below because I
have two favorites from Sigma I forgot
about these I've been so obsessed with
my Beauty Blender which I love this is
the most flawless application and you
just start in the middle and you just
get it all over and you're found I used
it today with my Revlon Colorstay this
is so amazing and I I will say the
Beauty Blender it sheers out the
coverage this is just flawless and I
have been dancing and sweating today and
my foundation I didn't have to touch it
up it's just full oo less so it's the
f-84 I love I like that it's Esley it's
it a lot of people get the flat top one
too they're both the same they're dense
they're just amazing the other one that
I've been using for my concealer oh is
the f-86 it's their tapered kabuki it's
kind of tapered like they say it goes up
but it's amazing cuz it's that same
really really dense
quality but you can just get right in
there and just blend it out and it's
flawless for your concealer and it works
I've tried it with all the concealers I
own it is amazing and these two together
I was just mmm I love them and the thing
is a lot of people say Sigma it's like
oh it's it's cheaper but to me they're
kind of high-end they are you know
fifteen to twenty dollars or twelve to I
don't really know how much there was
pretty bad um but the thing is I was
thinking I was like if these are like
fourteen or fifteen dollars I would
spend that buying like two lipsticks at
the drugstore
whereas I could buy the brush and yeah
it's fifteen dollars at one time but I'm
gonna use this forever you know what I
mean and it's just so amazing same for
Bowl and of course you can get set so
I'll link Sigma down below because
they're amazing
I also have a coupon code for like I
think it's ten percent off and I think
Sigma sends a free gift now with
purchase as well so all of that info
will be down below who okay I told you
it's gonna be mom I'm sorry okay another
product I fell in love with the Revlon
Photoready sculpting blush palette I
have it in the shade pink rose and it's
just so perfect for travel they're not
as pigmented as you would hope however
it ends up being a really pretty look
because you don't have to work to see
you can almost barely see it I know but
when you actually put them on if you're
a fair-skinned it's beautiful if you're
darker than I am I would say you
wouldn't like it period now they have
other shades that you might like but for
this one I love it is so it's the
prettiest look if your fair skin because
it's just a light dusting I love it it
in my head like I think of like the snow
and it just being like glistening and
just so beautiful so I love this and oh
it was on clearance at Walgreens for
like $3 all these were so go check out
Walgreens see if you can snag it because
haha ok another product I've loved its
though Revlon it's their color burst
lacquer bombs that they have and it's in
the shade demure and it comes in the
shiny little one and of course it's just
the typical and it smells yeah still
smells like mint it's just the perfect
everyday color you know I'm all about
the everyday because well I live my life
everyday isn't it pretty though I mean
you don't even have to think about it
when you put it on there is a little bit
of glitter too but not
really like and it doesn't wear off
where it leaves glitter behind or
anything weird like that this is a I
think it's my favorite in the lacquer
balm collection I really really like it
so if you're kind of looking for an
everyday one you'd love this one
okay another favorite is another lip
product the Sonia Kashuk satin luxe lip
color isn't the packaging adorable and
it's in the shade blushing it has a
swatch of it on top and it's like the
matte black packaging and it just feels
like heavy and luxurious and it is so so
pretty it really satin is the perfect
name for it's this one because it's
almost matte but it's got a little Sheen
so it doesn't look dry on your lips but
it kind of has that matte look it is the
perfect balance between Matt and not
matte so satin of course is the perfect
word I love it I love the packaging
I love these lipsticks and this is just
my favorite blushing and you guys know
I'm not that bold of my lips and I still
like this one in semi mole right I think
it's sort of cool
okay another rediscovered favorite the
color tattoos and my two favorite right
now and if you see my face of the days I
think it's been in the past few face of
the days on Instagram this is barely
branded just a really pretty
you know champagne color I always put
that on my lid when I use it and then
this one toughest oh it's a matte taupe
color and I used like a smaller brush to
apply it into the crease and then I just
kind of blend it out with my fingers I
usually still top them with the shadow
but not always and actually on
Thanksgiving I wore these too just as
they are and I loved it and they stay on
all day I mean you don't need anything
with them it's amazing another one for
winter that I always pull out and I need
to go buy another one my boyfriend's mom
actually got me this it's kind of
scratched up
it's the Vaseline lip therapy it's this
teeny tiny little thing and every time I
pull it out everyone's like but it's in
the cocoa butter scent or whatever you
want to call it but it's almost gone but
it's not Vaseline it's I'm assuming it's
not petroleum jelly in it but it's some
other you know there's other things in
it and it just feels so nice on my lips
and it's the only thing in the winter
that I really feel like protects my lips
from the wind when I go out running or
just when I'm out and about because you
know your lips get wind burnt they get
even
Thunder in the winter really um so it's
just so nice there really it just
protects I feel like it even heals I
don't know if it does but to me like
once they are when burnt the this like
fixes them in like a day I love this
stuff I put it on in the morning effort
on the middle of the day I put it on at
night I love it and it's like 2 or 3
bucks and it lasts forever another
favorite is the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer i if you watched my
recent haul I talked about this how I
got it in a kit for like 20 bucks it was
dis and it which is a miniature size and
this alone for like the full size is
like $25 or $30 something ridiculously
priced but the packaging is still cute
but it's a smaller size which I never go
through a whole bronzer anyway and it
came with like three other things it
came with a mascara a Too Faced a
two-phase mascara to face shadow primer
and the face primer can't think of the
names for 20 bucks it's such a good deal
on the Sephora website so go check that
video out but it's this is just it
smells like chocolate it's the perfect
shade of bronzer it's matte it's just
perfect for fair skin probably even dark
skin I love it I love love love it okay
a product I have not been loving now
this is my own fault I bought this
forever ago oh my gosh like back when I
used to live in Chicago five six years
ago
it's the cargo bronzer I think it was
the bronzer in matte medium first of all
I should have known this would be way
too dark for me but I liked that was
Matt also it's orange this bronzer is
orange and I remember my friend that
used to wear cargo products all the time
I remember her face always looked orange
and I always wondered why and I knew she
used it I wonder if this was the shade I
don't know it is certainly an orange
bronzer Oh ladies unless you have that
tone of skin stay away oh my gosh
and of course I'm so fair to I just
should have known I should have known
but clearly I got a lot of use out of it
back in the day and then I realized
yikes I look like a No
so I stopped let for comparison this is
just for fun this is I never thought
about doing this look at the difference
between these two bronzers oh it's not
even picking it up in the camera dang it
if you could see these in real life it's
like night and day this is like a really
nice like brown toned bronzer the Too
Faced one anyway so that was a mistake
another favorite is the Physicians
Formula I love this stuff that I booster
eyeliner and it's they say it boosts
your lash growth I don't know about all
that but it can do really really thin
lines it's not the best swamp they can
do thick lines thin lines but the brush
is just great this I've had for like a
year and it still hasn't run out and I'm
use it every single day every day I
don't use it in my waterline though I
don't know how that would do I don't
think it would do well but I love love
love it for everyday so those are all my
favorites for this month I hope you
enjoyed I know I talked about a lot of
links they're all below and yeah I think
that's it i hope that was enjoyable
yours like my tree me and my boyfriend
decorated the other day and like all of
the ornaments are disney related to all
but most and then my friend Emily I
remember a couple years ago I didn't
have any ornaments like I owned none and
so that year for Christmas she bought me
like 10 ornaments so half of those are
from her which I love anyway but I hope
you've enjoyed this video I'll catch you
guys so soon have a good December bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
