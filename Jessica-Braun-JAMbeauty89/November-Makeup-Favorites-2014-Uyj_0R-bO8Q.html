November favorites and i'm so excited
cuz in front of me are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
wait did I do that one two three four
five six seven eight nine nine things
that I absolutely love this month some
of them are once I've loved for a very
long time and others are new to me and
I'm so excited to share them with you so
let's go the very first thing you knew I
was gonna bring it up is vanilla bean
Noel anything this is their nourishing
hand cream which I adore it's really
it's just so much more moisturizing than
even their body cream which I also own
and love and use every single day in the
winter but this is perfect for your
purse because it is just that much more
moisturizing because your hands get so
dry it this time of year and i love it
and it smells like heaven even if you're
not a vanilla person you should smell
this because you just might be surprised
it is amazing oh my gosh it's amazing i
even have a plug-in now in a candle i
ended up going back after my last haul
about it i ended up going back and
getting more i just couldn't not i love
it so much another favorite is the mac
fix+ spray this is one that i had gone
back and forth on quite a few times and
when i did my recent mac favorites video
I kind of rediscovered it as I was kind
of prepping for the video for a few
weeks and trying out all my mac things
and deciding what I loved and what I
didn't and this one is really truly
amazing you just spray it all over your
face and you let it dry and it just it
makes your skin so do ii without adding
shimmer or anything like that the only
caution i would say is if you get greasy
here maybe powder that after you spray
it or just avoid this area but other
than that it makes everything else looks
so beautiful and the small size which is
what i have is like i want to say around
ten dollar so it's really not that crazy
especially since now they're putting out
some settings phrase in the drugstore
that are more expensive than that anyway
i would say just go for the mac one i
love it so much another favorite and
this one's more expensive and i thought
about not mentioning it but you've got
to know about it because it's amazing
this is the josie maran argan cleansing
oil and this one i have had this for a
year now and i'm only to hear this stuff
lasts forever i will be repurchasing it
basically the idea behind a cleansing
oil is that you can squirt it in your
hand and then rub your makeup off with
it and then you've got to cleanse your
face with an actual facial cleanser or
soap but this takes the place of makeup
wipes and I make a remover on a cotton
pad and it's a little bit in my head I
think it's less abrasive especially for
you know the delicate skin that's around
your eyes you know when you're rubbing a
makeup wipe their I just feel like it's
got to be just pulling on your tired
skin whereas with this you're just kind
of getting enough and it's so powerful
yet moisturizing that it just really
breaks it down like within two swipes
and then you wash it off it is so
amazing it's worth every penny
especially since it lasts forever so if
you're looking for some other
alternative method for taking your
makeup off you really this is absolutely
worth the splurge oh and i will be i
hate how expensive it is but i will be
buying it again because it's amazing and
they have this sometimes on hautelook i
bought a bunch of small ones that i
already used up they were like six
dollars on hautelook and i think i ended
up maybe I did refill that I don't
remember but one of my favorite eyebrow
gels if not my favorite is this NYX
control freak eyebrow gel it's like 599
at ulta calm a lot of people said they
can't find it in stores I just ordered
it online so that's what I would do if I
were you because it sounds like it's
sold out like everywhere but online you
can get it and it's so simple I mean
it's just and you know similar to a
mascara big ol Juan but you just brush
it through to keep your eyebrows in
place and this is like hairspray for
your brows but it's so much cheaper than
the Anasazi one which is like $22 for
the exact same size and there I swear to
you they might be the same formula this
is amazing and I will probably never
unless someone gifts it to me or I there
some insane do I probably won't buy the
Anasazi one again because this is just
as good and it's so much cheaper like
seventy-five percent cheaper another
favorite this is the real techniques
blush brush and boy I got a lot of blush
on it this is the most amazing blush
brush it is one of those brushes that
you can just get a little bit on the
side tap it off and just go shoot and
your blush is perfect it's like what I
used to I used to watch news anchors
cash the blush is so perfectly placed
and in my head this is what they use
this is the exact shape you want I mean
everything about this brush is perfect
the price point I want to say it's like
eight or nine dollars and then sometimes
Alta has buy one get one half off on
these brushes almost always so I would
recommend buying this one and the expert
face brush those are my two favorites by
those two in conjunction because they
are amazing i love it i can't i
literally can't make myself use any
other blush brush cuz i just i keep
rewatching this and using this one cuz
it's so good ok this is the Sigma
product now i am a sigma affiliate and i
almost want to put that in quotes
because i haven't mentioned sigma and
like ever i think i've mentioned it in
like four videos ever because i get
really tired of watching and i know you
guys feel the same way lots of us here
on YouTube are Sigma affiliates you know
it's not very hard to get in if you will
and you know you can make I think the
Commission you make is like ten percent
and you know that's like pennies on the
dollar at the end of the day if someone
just buying a brush so I don't get why
people are touting it so much just in
Sigma products are great it's not like
people are lying because they really
aren't good and I have brushes and I
love them but I I don't know when people
are mentioned them all the time it makes
me crazy regardless this is one that
they had sent to me for free a long time
ago and I had honestly forgotten about
it and i just recently tried it and I
can't stop using it i used it my crease
today really lightly this is there
eyeshadow in otra dom and it is the most
beautiful bronzy brown but it's like a
cool tone brown with almost a silver
tint to it it's so gorgeous and they
blend so beautifully and i was just
taken aback and i'm so mad at myself for
having this for like six months and
never really giving it a love i love it
and i want to say their eye shadows are
pretty inexpensive I don't know but I
just love it it reminds me kind of a mac
satin taupe a little bit but I think I
like this better because I just like the
tint of it a little bit better
regardless i love it and that is my
honest opinion i have i get i have the
referral link and I've got to update the
coupon code because I haven't done that
in a long time either so i'll put that
down below I think it's ten percent off
we'll figure it out together ladies but
I love it so much so much
okay now on to some lips my last three
products are lip products they are two
of them are drugstore one is Mac this is
what I'm wearing on my lips so I'm
wearing the Mac lip pencil and sore this
is the one that you know who wears I
think there's a few that she wears but
this is one of them I'm not gonna say
her name because i know people go crazy
and I kind of go crazy right here but I
also do like the lip look so anyway this
is lip pencil and sore and it's just a
really pretty dusty mauve that's what
I'm going to call it and I just it is
pretty and it does a great job of
defining your lips in the best of ways
so I put that on the outside of it and
then I kind of mixed these this is the
wet and wild mega lass and rose to fame
again another dusty mauve but this one
is a little bit more it's just a little
bit lighter and a little bit Pinker
which i think is more flattering on the
lips so I have ended up using this a lot
and it's a little bit lighter which
looks really nice on the inside but on
the innermost part of my lips I used one
of the Maybelline matte lipsticks and
daringly nude now this one is a lot
lighter almost coral nude but not quite
but it is still got the brown tint I
don't know how else to describe it but
this the mac collection formula is
amazing I mean I this is still the only
one I bought in looking at my lipsticks
I'm like okay I need no more lipsticks
however i love this formula so much and
so I think I might go the next time
there's like a clearance sale or
something and I have a coupon not
Clarence like a buy one get one half off
and get a few more shades but this is
this one and daringly nude and I just
really like it it's great on its own but
it looks really great in conjunction
with this one because it's lighter you
can put it on the inner part to make
your lips look a little bit fuller it
looks great even with sore it's a really
drastic difference but if you kind of
mix it together well it looks really
really cool too and it makes your lips
look really big so those are all of my
favorites I can't wait to hear what
you've been loving down below and if you
enjoyed please subscribe and I'll catch
you guys very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
