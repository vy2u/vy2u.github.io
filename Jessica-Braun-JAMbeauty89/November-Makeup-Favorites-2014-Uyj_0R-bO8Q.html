November and favorites and I'm so
excited cuz in front of me are one two
three four five six seven eight nine
wait did I do that one two three four
five six seven eight nine nine things
that I absolutely loved this month some
of them are ones I've loved for a very
long time and others are new to me and
I'm so excited to share them with you so
let's go the very first thing you knew I
was gonna bring it up is vanilla bean
Noel anything this is their nourishing
hand cream which I adore it's really
it's just so much more moisturizing than
even their body cream which I also own
and love and use every single day in the
winter but this is perfect for your
purse because it is just that much more
moisturizing because your hands get so
dry at this time of year and I love it
and it smells like heaven even if you're
not a vanilla person you should smell
this because you just might be surprised
it is amazing
oh my gosh it's amazing I even have a
plug-in now in a candle I ended up going
back after my last haul about it I ended
up going back and getting more I just
couldn't not I loved it so much
another favorite is the mac fix+ spray
this is one that I had gone back and
forth on quite a few times and when I
did my recent Mac favorites video I kind
of rediscovered it as I was kind of
prepping for the video for a few weeks
and trying out all my Mac things and
deciding what I loved and what I didn't
and this one is really truly amazing you
just spray it all over your face and you
let it dry and it just it makes your
skin so dewy without adding shimmer or
anything like that the only caution I
would say is if you get greasy here
maybe powder that after you spray it or
just avoid this area but other than that
it makes everything else looks so
beautiful and the small size which is
what I have is like I want to say around
$10 so it's really not that crazy
especially since now they're putting out
some settings raised in the drugstore
that are more expensive than that anyway
I would say just go for the Mac one I
love it so much another favorite and
this one's more expensive and I thought
about not mentioning it but you've got
to know about it because it's amazing
this is the Josie Maran Argan cleansing
oil and this one I have had this for a
year now and I'm only to hear this stuff
lasts forever I will be repurchasing it
because
basically the idea behind a cleansing
oil is that you can squirt it in your
hand and then rub your makeup off with
it and then you've got to cleanse your
face with an actual facial cleanser or
soap but this takes the place of makeup
wipes and I make a remover on a cotton
pad and it's a little bit in my head I
think it's less abrasive especially for
you know the delicate skin that's around
your eyes you know when you're rubbing a
makeup wipe there I just feel like it's
gotta be just pulling on your tired skin
whereas with this you're just kind of
getting enough and it's so powerful yet
moisturizing that it just really breaks
it down like within two swipes and then
you wash it off it is so amazing it's
worth every penny especially since it
lasts forever so if you're looking for
some other alternative method for taking
your makeup off you really this is
absolutely worth the splurge uh and I
will be I hate how expensive it is that
I will be buying it again because it's
amazing and they have this sometimes on
HauteLook I bought a bunch of small ones
that I already used up they were like
six dollars on HauteLook and I think I
ended up maybe I did refill that I don't
remember but one of my favorite eyebrow
gels
if not my favorite is this NYX control
freak eyebrow gel it's like $5.99 at
Ulta calm a lot of people said they
can't find it in stores I just ordered
it online so that's what I would do if I
were you because it sounds like it's
sold out like every year but online you
can get it and it's so simple I mean
it's just you know similar to a mascara
big ol wand but you just brush it
through to keep your eyebrows in place
and this is like hairspray for your
brows but it's so much cheaper than the
anastacio one which is like twenty-two
dollars for the exact same size and
they're I swear to you they might be the
same formula this is amazing and I will
probably never unless someone gifts it
to me or itthere some insane do I
probably won't buy the honest size you
want again because this is just as good
and it's so much cheaper like 75%
cheaper another favorite this is the
Real Techniques blush brush and boy I
got a lot of blush on it this is the
most amazing blush brush it is one of
those brushes that you can just get a
little bit on the side tap it off and
just go Shoop and your blush is perfect
it's like what I used to I used to watch
news anchors
- the blush is so perfectly placed and
in my head this is what they use this is
the exact shape you want I mean
everything about this brush is perfect
at the price point I want to say it's
like eight or nine dollars and then
sometimes Ulta has buy one get one half
off on these brushes almost always so I
would recommend buying this one and the
expert face brush those are my two
favorites by those two in conjunction
because they are amazing I love it I
can't I literally can't make myself use
any other blush brush because I just I
keep re watching this and using this one
cuz it's so good okay this is the Sigma
product now I am a Sigma affiliate and I
almost want to put that in quotes
because I haven't mentioned Sigma and
like ever I think I've mentioned it in
like four videos ever because I get
really tired of watching and I know you
guys feel the same way lots of us here
on YouTube our Sigma affiliates you know
it's not very hard to get in if you will
and you know you can make I think the
Commission you make is like 10% and you
know that's like pennies on the dollar
at the end of the day if someone's just
buying a brush so I don't get why people
are touting it so much just and Sigma
products are great it's not like people
are lying because they really aren't
good and I have brushes and I love them
but I I don't know when people are
mentioned them all the time it makes me
crazy regardless this is one that they
had sent to me for free a long time ago
and I had honestly forgotten about it
and I just recently tried it and I can't
stop using I used it my crease today
really lightly this is their eyeshadow
and Notre Dom and it is the most
beautiful bronzy brown but it's like a
cool tongue brown with almost a silver
tint to it it's so gorgeous and they it
blends so beautifully and I was just
taken aback and I'm so mad at myself for
having this for like 6 months and never
really giving in love I love it and I
want to say there i shadow czar pretty
inexpensive i don't know but i just love
it i it reminds me kind of a Mac satin
taupe a little bit but I think I like
this better cuz I just like the tint of
it a little bit better regardless I love
it and that is my honest opinion I have
I get I have the referral link and I've
got to update the coupon code because I
haven't done that in a long time either
so I'll put that down below I think it's
10% off we'll figure it out together
ladies but I love it so much so much
okay now on to some lips my last three
products are lip products they are two
of them are drugstore one is Mac this is
what I'm wearing on my lips so I'm
wearing the Mac lip pencil and sore this
is the one that you know who wears I
think there's a few that she wears but
this is one of them I'm not gonna say
her name cuz I know people go crazy and
I kind of go crazy when I hear it but I
also do like the lip look so anyway this
is lip pencil and soar and it's just a
really pretty dusty mauve that's what
I'm gonna call it and I just it is
pretty and it does a great job of
defining your lips in the best of ways
so I put that on the outside of it and
then I kind of mixed these this is the
Wet n Wild mega lass and rose to fame
again another dusty mauve but this one
is a little bit more it's just a little
bit lighter and a little bit Pinker
which i think is more flattering on the
lips so I have ended up using this a lot
and it's a little bit lighter which
looks really nice on the inside
but on the innermost part of my lips I
used one of the Maybelline matte
lipsticks and daringly nude now this one
is a lot lighter almost coral nude but
not quite but it is still got the brown
tint I don't know how else to describe
it but this the matte collection formula
is amazing I mean I this is still the
only one I bought and looking at my
lipsticks I'm like okay I need no more
lipsticks however I love this formula so
much and so I think I might go the next
time there's like a clarence sale or
something and I have a coupon on
clearance like a buy one get one half
off and get a few more shades but this
is this one and daringly nude and I just
really like it it's great on its own but
it looks really great in conjunction
with this one because it's lighter you
can put it on the inner part to make
your lips look a little bit fuller it
looks great even with soar it's a really
drastic difference but if you kind of
mix it together well it looks really
really cool too and it makes your lips
look really big so those are all of my
favorites I can't wait to hear what
you've been loving down below and if you
enjoyed please subscribe and I'll catch
you guys very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
