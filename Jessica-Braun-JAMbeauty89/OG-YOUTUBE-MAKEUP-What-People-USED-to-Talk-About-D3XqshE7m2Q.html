to share with you hey new video idea at
least it's new to me and I think I came
up with it but probably I didn't and I
just don't know like why it's in my
brain
do you guys know what I mean regardless
um I'm talking about products that just
make me think of OG YouTube just
old-school original YouTube that I
started watching you know five six years
ago and I've never looked back but these
are products that back in the day before
I had a channel I heard so many people
talking about and so I just thought this
would be fun and kind of nostalgic I
have seen a lot of nostalgic YouTube so
maybe that's why it's in my brain people
doing I mean this video has to be other
it doesn't matter so I'm excited to
share I've got a whole bunch of products
in front of me that I want to talk about
that
we're loved back then and you know some
of them I still love today and so let's
go ahead and get into it
so first thing that I thought of I mean
please first thing any of us think of is
probably the naked palette this is to me
very nostalgic and yet it's still an
amazing palette I mean you can't take
away the fact and this is my original
one I bought it's very very loved my
favorite shade for the longest time was
half-baked which is like this gorgeous
gold it's like the best let me swatch it
on my hand the best gold shadow ever
although there was a steel one called
bubbly and that's my favorite my actual
favorite gold shadow ever I don't even
know if they still sell it was like in
one of their older palettes but I also
really really loved to sit over here
I know buck which is like the matte
Brown is a very loved one like in
tutorials and things so there's toasted
and then buck is right there and I
remember back in the day I'm like buck
is too dark like I can't blend that into
like the crease but now that I have a
little more experience with makeup I'm
like okay now I get it but back then I'm
like oh look I need a medium shade well
that really is more of a medium
depending on your skin tone but I love
this palette so so much oh my gosh next
product is the Urban Decay primer potion
it's a very good eye shadow primer it
it's just tacky and sticky enough it's
kind of almost has that pore filling
kind of feel even though it's not like a
pore filling primer it's for your eyes
but it just kind of smooths everything
out it really does hold on to shadow now
because this one's the original it does
not have any like color to it or
anything so it's not necessarily gonna
make your eyeshadow like pop more like a
white primer would but it's still really
really nice so this is actually a more
recent repurchase just because I was
like I kind of Miss having it my
collection it's really good now of
course there are other drugstore options
out there that are just as good like the
Milani primer Milani eye primers
absolutely just as good and it's way
cheaper but I still like having this in
my collection just for like nostalgia
steak sake steak sake sorry guys another
og one was the NYX mega shine lip gloss
this was in the shade beige I heard so
many people talk about back in the day I
talked it in the early talked about it
and that really is my channel it's a
pink color don't know why they called it
beige has a really strong cherry scent
but I remember people would do whole
videos on these lip glosses and just you
know they'd have every shade which is
insane because there's so many shades
but they'd have every shade and they
would swatch them all and it's just a
standard lip gloss but it's really nice
it's comfortable it's not sticky the
packaging has not changed a bit there's
still a little bow on top another one
that was very well-loved back in the day
it was the NYX pore filler primer
I remember hearing out this from like
shades of Cassie I think back before I
had a channel and a lot of people and
myself included I'll only use it on my
nose because it is a very filling primer
now NYX has raised the price of this and
I don't think it used to be that
expensive but it's kind of a peachy tone
it becomes translucent and it's very
very you know that very velvety feel
very poor filling now if you keep
rubbing it it's going to start to pill
up just a bit depending on the
moisturizer you have underneath because
because of the nature of the product so
you can kind of press it in but it
definitely fills pores I mean there's no
doubt about it and that's why it was so
well-loved and for a long time it was
pretty cheap but I want to say when I
bought this one again I
it was like 15 dollars or something and
I was like what but it is really good
but still I was just kind of shocked
because I think it used to be like $5.99
you know I'm right maybe I'm making that
up
another og YouTube bronzer was the
freaking Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer people ate this stuff up but so
did I and then they came out with more
recently the milk chocolate and no one
really actually really is too light I'll
use this sometimes but I'm like it's
it's almost just too light even for me
but smells like chocolate a really nice
bronzer shade for someone near my
skintone yeah it definitely has that
fake chocolate smell I like that
beautiful packaging and it's just a
standard bronzer is the reality there's
nothing wrong with it it's good at lasts
pretty well throughout the day I use it
all the time I have no complaints but
you know do I think this you know now
knowing what I know
do I think this is like leaps and bounds
above other drugstore bronzers know for
example I am really digging the essence
Sun Club matte bronzing powder I really
really like this and it's a huge pan
that's like five bucks I also really
like of course the butter bronzer is
well-loved on YouTube nowadays wonderful
very similar tone this is the light one
very similar tone to this let me just
show you maybe you know I mean they're
really really similar maybe a little
lighter so if you get like the medium
bronzer it might be a little closer um
so I mean there are drugstore options
out there that are just as good but I do
still like this again all of these well
yeah no all of these are products I like
but it doesn't mean there aren't
drugstore alternatives out there does
that make sense okay so another one the
Urban Decay all nighter a lot of urban
decay is what I've kind of realized like
that was such a big brand it still is a
huge brand but it was such a big brand
back then like that was like the brand
to have everything in and the all
nighter spray it's made by Scandinavia
and sorry apparently needed to take a
sip of tea right then um I like it a lot
this is probably the third bottle I've
owned I've also owned the skin to Naevia
once they perform the same I really like
both but you know really good mister
they've only
had a good mr. on it they have changed
the packaging over the years but I do
feel like it makes a little bit of a
difference in the staying power of my
makeup do I think it's like night and
day no but do I use a setting spray
every day yeah I like the feel of it I
let it makes me feel like my makeups
done it helps it all kind of melt
together and so I still really like it
another favorite was the Rimmel stay
matte a lot of people talked about this
myself included it's like five bucks
they have a translucent shade this is in
sandstone swashing it you can't see it
this is in sandstorm which is a darker
shade how well this is a darker shade
I'll never understand but it was very
well loved
I mean honestly these all kind of go on
translucent but they're just so good at
soaking up just enough oil but not so
much that it's just so powdery and that
was why I originally loved it and why a
lot of people loved it and it's still
that same quality so and so cheap boxed
blushes from benefit these were so huge
and I remember like I would watch makeup
collection videos be like oh my gosh
because someone would have all of the
box blushes and I would just like to
stare out I'm like oh my gosh coralista
and Bella balm but whatever else you
know and it's funny because over the
years I've I've owned all of them and
I've decluttered over the years all of
them but this one this is in the shade
Dallas looks like a bronzer it's I mean
you can wear it as a bronzer but it's a
little bit rosy tone so I wear it as a
blush and it's one of my favorite
blushes of all time I love the smell
they each have their own smell but you
know they just have that you know you
shut the little box and it's magnetized
and it comes with the little brush that
I never used so I never keep but I
really I liked all of them it was just
more of a I didn't use them so I felt
guilty keeping them and now I'm saying
this out loud now I'm like now I want
them all back cuz I want to like try
them all again what's that one that's
like oh hervana I want that one back I
think I regret getting rid of that one
anyway so these were huge and I do still
really love Dallas that she oh my gosh
remember the L'Oreal infallible shadows
these are still awesome and still talked
about today but these were really big
back then because there really wasn't
anything like it in the drugstore so the
most popular shade well one of is
rush and that's one that I still have
today so flipping Goro I'm trying to put
it on top of that like primer that did
not work on top of the face primer there
we go gorgeous kind of bronzy shade well
that's it there too but it's on top of
that pore filling primer regardless is
so gorgeous I mean you can't beat it for
the price again I think they've raised
the prices over the years but you know
it's a drugstore brand you can find
sales coupons things like that but love
this what was the other one I used to
love iced latte it was it like a
champagne white kind of a shimmer and
I'd put it all over my lids oh I loved
that you could probably even used as a
highlighter now but these were so big
for good reason they're really good put
it on top of a primer and it is not
budging so much pigmentation gorgeous
another popular one word the makeup
forever
Ultra HD foundations eye this is the you
know new formulation but I had the old
one and when I got married that's what I
wore and I wish it was still that
formula I this is so good I still like
this I just felt like the last one the
original formula was maybe slightly more
moisturizing and so my skin liked it
better does that make sense I think this
is just a little bit more drying and it
probably makes it more long wearing but
it doesn't look as good on my skin but I
do still use it like it I have the shade
Y 225 which is I think a little dark for
me right now
I could put like some cover FX drops in
it but I keep it because in this summer
this really is a pretty good match for
me I really do like it still though like
I said it's got nice coverage it does
stay on really well it looks gorgeous in
photography that's why I work for my
wedding but my recommendation with for a
similar look I still love the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation and that
one I need to buy again because I think
my last one had gone bad and I had to
get rid of it that one I kind of
mentioned in my wedding makeup dupes
video for like expensive ones I can link
that below I mean it was a couple years
ago but I still stand by everything I
said I basically gave high-end versions
of wedding makeup and then drugstore
dupes and for my wedding a lot of it I
wore the drugstore version you know so
I'll link that below if you're
interested if you're getting married or
special event wedding makeup anyway I do
like it ok another one Mac Paint Pots
again this hearkens
to the days of like Elle and Blair
Fowler if you know who they are I mean
they're still around but they they own
so much Matt I could have pulled out any
of my Mac products and said Mac singles
and mac lipsticks but I mean the reality
is I just picked a few it was this all I
picked you know what I need to get again
the mac prolongwear concealer I
completely forgot about that stuff I
loved that stuff and I used my last one
up or maybe it went bad and I never
bought another and I just remembered
that and now I miss it and I need it
anyway but Mac Paint Pots these were
huge the only two I currently own is
well one of them is soft ochre which I
use as a primer on my eyes and I love
this this is like I'm in a hurry
depth update and it's perfect and then
Indian wood my favorite kind of color
one it's this gorgeous bronze it's got a
little sheen to it but it's not glitter
at all and it just looks gorgeous I'll
put it all over my eyes blend into the
crease and that's it and it looks so
beautiful I know a lot of you guys have
picked this up on my recommendation but
people used to love the shade rubenesque
which again I want to buy that again and
try it cuz it's been years but it was a
very kind of peachy orange color and
back when I owned it I didn't like that
color on my eyes now I'm like now that's
totally my thing and now I want to try
it again I know I can usually get these
half off when they have Mac on HauteLook
it'll be 50% off and I've seen
rubenesque on there every single time so
I think next time it's on there it'll be
it'd be like 10 bucks I think I'm gonna
buy it I can link out look below I
mentioned all time because I buy like
everything I own they're like all of my
clothes these earring No maybe I got
these earrings at Target actually this
shirt most of my shirts i buy on
HauteLook
but this shirts actually my sister's
it's a maternity shirt and she's uh
letting me borrow it and I really I just
like it I borrowed a couple of her tops
and things last product I mentioned is
the buxom lip glosses the original
prankster was the one in white Russian
and I remember if that's the one that
like oh yeah they were like Kim
Kardashian wears her or maybe that was
the NARS one regardless they have this
tingling kind of plumping effect I have
the shades
and II that I like I have a few shades I
think I mean it's just a standard lip
gloss you can't really see it looks like
this but kind of clear I like that
feeling but these were so big and I
remember saving up to buy like my first
one but I think by then I had a channel
but I still feel like that was a when
they first came out you know years back
people were like oh my gosh and this is
one of those products I can remember
being in a Sephora and just like looking
at all of the different buxom lip
glosses and being like I want them but I
didn't buy one anyway so those were a
bunch of just nostalgic makeup products
most of them I still really really love
let me know what do you remember from
back in the day like what products you
are being huge I'm kind of I'm excited
to read through these comments because I
feel like you guys are gonna mention
things that I'm gonna be like oh my gosh
I totally forgot that existed oh my gosh
a one thing I don't have would be the
Revlon lip butters that's like the
original like you - holy moly like
everyone was obsessed with them myself
included but I don't own me because they
were from years ago and they're pretty
old but um I kind of missed them I want
them to come back so other than that I
hope you enjoyed the video definitely
give it a thumbs up if you did I feel
like my eyes can't stop smiling cause
it's just put put me in a good mood
anyway I will see you guys in my next
video
