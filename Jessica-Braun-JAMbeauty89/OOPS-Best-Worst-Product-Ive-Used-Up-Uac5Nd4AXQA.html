an empties video for you if you never
seen one of these videos it's where I go
through products that I've used up
completely some of them they're just
about used up and so I really have a
good feel for how I feel about them if I
would recommend them to you if you
should go out and buy them because
they're life-changing or if they're just
kind of plant and maybe you should avoid
them I hope that you will subscribe
before you leave and come say hi on my
social media and let's go ahead and get
into it so I've got some hair care which
I feel like I very rarely have but I
have a lot of great things to recommend
and a lot of skincare and I also have a
good amount of makeup that I used up
which is so rare let's start with the
haircare because I never get to talk
about it so my favorite dry shampoo of
all time is the living proof perfect
hair day dry shampoo a lot of you guys
have bought this on my recommendation
and you've tweeted me snapped me and
said oh my gosh thank you so much it's
life-changing I literally have like a
tiny bit left I think what's so great
about it is that there are other dry
shampoos I like it's not like I only use
this one really only because I always
forget to buy more and it's a little bit
more expensive than of course drugstore
but it's so good and so you have to
shake it to kind of mix it all together
and then you know you can spray it in
the sections where you get the greasiest
typically near your roots and you wait a
little while I usually wait a couple
minutes and then I'll just kind of judge
it through my hair and then I brush it
out and I like to pair this with a dry
conditioner those you just spray on the
bottom half of your hair because if you
notice when you use dry shampoo and you
kind of brush it out the bottom half of
your hair just kind of gets frayed and
weird and dry conditioner is amazing
because it's not greasy I mean I
wouldn't spray it into your roots but
it's not super greasy it just kind of
pulls your hair back together and then
your whole head feels like you just
washed and blow-dried it it's amazing
but I love this stuff I have not found a
drugstore equivalent of this if you have
one you recommend let me know I've tried
virtually everything out there but it's
amazing so the next haircare product I
tried was the way haircare shampoo and
conditioner and it's from the repair
line I have a tiny bit left that I'll
probably use up but I don't hold on to
these for the next round of empties um
I don't really get what the hype is
behind these I thought it was a good
shampoo conditioner I mean by no means
is it bad it is a great shampoo
conditioner but I've tried plenty of
drugstore ones that I think are just as
good and I know some drugstore ones
don't have quite as nice of ingredients
but there are a lot of drugstore ones
that do and even a lot of hair stylists
will tell you that but I I thought it
was nice I think it was a list a little
bit so if I were to ever try anymore
from their line I might do a different
line not the repair line but it was good
I'm not going to repurchase it the smell
everyone was freaking out about how good
it smells I don't understand it because
it just smells like hairspray to me not
necessarily a bad way but it's certainly
not one that I've been pining over and I
love since but I did not really care
much about the this scent so speaking of
hair if you see any like gray bits or
white bits I there's a lot oh my gosh um
I was painting a bunch of my friends one
of them we were painting their house
yesterday and I could not get this paint
out of my hair I'm like the messiest
painter so it'll be probably there for a
week as I continue to try to wash out on
my hair so if you see that or it looks
like I've got a lot of Gray's that's
what it is they promise all right next
one
that's almost gone is my favorite hair
spray of all time this is the Bed Head
masterpiece hairspray these are
humongous I never buy them full price I
always find them like Ulta will have
sales on these like buy one get one free
or buy one get one 50% off sometimes
they'll just straight-up have these on
sale for $8.99 and they're normally
around like 20 ish so I never buy it for
full price but when they are on sale
usually by like three so I have a little
bit left to this I'm going to use I like
it to use it whether I'm wearing my hair
naturally wavy curly or when I'm wearing
like this because it just gets rid of
any frizz ease but it doesn't weigh your
hair down but it also doesn't make it
crunchy it smells amazing so I feel like
my hair smells good it looks good I just
I love this stuff I've never found
anything I've loved as much as this and
this love has been going on for like six
years now
next haircare one is this Rusk wired
flexible styling cream again I have just
a little bit left this eye
newse when i am wearing my hair
naturally wavy and curly I know a lot of
you guys have asked in recent videos
because I've been wearing it that way a
lot more and I all I do is I get a
squirt of this kind of cream into my
hand probably about a quarter size
amount and I rub it between my hands and
then I rub it into my hair i'll Sprunt a
little bit with it or scrunch but I
typically will use like a mousse for
that part but I do feel like this step
as my first step is great at holding the
curls together and then the mousse holds
it together even more but it also adds
that volume and then hairspray locks it
all in and then you blow-dry it with a
diffuser it is amazing and I really like
this stuff
I haven't branched out from this in a
long time because I just like it
I might when I'm out of this maybe try
something different and see but we'll
see cuz I always end up coming back to
this alright I only have one body care
empty and it's the Aveeno positively
smooth shave gel I like this stuff this
is like the third one I've bought but I
have one that I like more I'll just show
you really fast I'm also filming April
favorites today and it's one of my
favorites it's the Gillette Venus shower
and shave cream this stuff is so
moisturizing on your legs it's not a
phone by any means although this one
kind of foams up but it doesn't foam up
a ton ton I remembering that right um
but I just like this stuff so much more
and you I get so much more uses out of
it because it's like as much as a body
wash and you don't need that much to
shave your legs so this stuff is good
what I ever buy it again absolutely I
like it but right now I'm really smitten
with this stuff shall we do the makeup
and then the skincare this KanCare then
the makeup I'm gonna make you guys wait
I'm gonna do the skincare first I'm just
excited with some of the skincare and
some of it I did not like it all let's
start with that I did not like this
mineral fusion makeup removing oil
cleanser it's literally full I'm passing
it on it's been sitting in my bathroom
like oh maybe I'll use it again it kind
of I don't know I felt like it didn't do
a good job of getting rid of my makeup
and that's the whole point of this and
when it doesn't do that well Michael
then why am I even wasting a step so I
just don't like it I like oil like
makeup removing cleansers but I like
them to be a little bit thicker than
this this was pretty thin and I'd much
prefer a balm
so my next empty
really truly is empty is this it
cosmetics bye bye makeup this is the
product that made me fall in love with
these I didn't understand how these
worked before I tried this so I remember
like looking it up I'm like okay you
just kind of rub it you literally get a
little glop of like the thick kind of
not cream but what do you call balm so
you get a little glop of the balm you
rub it between your hands and on a dry
face you just start working it into your
face and your makeup just melts off and
so then your face just looks crazy and
like just messy but then you rinse it
with warm water and your face is
moisturized because it's a very
moisturizing type of balm but also your
makeup is gone so I do the double
cleanse method where I use something
like this and then I go in with a
cleanser and my skin is so much less dry
than it usually is I have so many less
breakouts I think because I'm really
getting that makeup out but I'm not
tugging at my skin and I don't know I
just I love this I also like the
Clinique take the day off balm those two
are my favorites right now I'm using a
different one let me tell ya it's all
going in order isn't it um I've been
using I have like one more use in this
the elf hydrating gel melt cleanser this
one's just kind of a math product it's a
little bit more petroleum jelly like
inconsistency whereas the bombs are
almost like I don't know how to describe
it it's like if you took something it's
almost like coconut oil but a little bit
easier to dig into that's exactly what
it's like whereas this is more like
petroleum jelly I don't think it gets
off my makeup as easily I feel like I
always have residue under my eyes and
I'm like seriously so again it makes me
feel like is this step even worth it
also I flew through this I fly through
these I guess regardless but I really
flew through this elf one and like I
said I'd like one more use left and I
feel like I've only been using it for
like three weeks which to me that's
really quick now on the bright side this
is so much cheaper than this but if it's
not really doing the job I can't
recommend it and I'm not going to buy it
again
so the next product are these Garnier
skin active my seller my seller makeup
removing towelettes these are all right
I didn't end up using I think I used
them once on my face it didn't remove my
makeup I don't typically use makeup
removing wipes on my face I just feel
like I have to tug so much they never do
it as well as like a balm would so I
just don't
but I do use these four swatches these
didn't remove makeup as well like I
think the elf cleansing cloths work
better you're just talking about
swatches now for your face this might be
better for your skin I don't know um it
was okay
I'm not going to repurchase it though I
can tell you that and two more skin care
and then makeup this is the Kota Lee
premier cru eye cream I liked this stuff
I I didn't feel like it was
life-changing this is a really expensive
product I love Kota Lee I love their
moisturizing sorbet I did in a video
recently I love their radiance serum
they're a lot of product and and they
also have this reservatrol cream that I
use in the mornings that I love but this
one I thought was not bad by any means
but it's a very very expensive product
and I just didn't feel like it was
life-changing
earth-shattering and I used it for a
very long time so I think you could get
an eye cream that does about the same
for a lot cheaper in fact elf's eye
cream is actually pretty decent
now speaking of ELF this is their
nourishing night cream it's okay it's
not as moisturizing as I want it to be
it's still a good moisturizer but it
almost feels like a daytime moisturizer
I could just put on in the morning which
there's nothing wrong with that but for
it to be their night cream I want it to
be a little bit I just like a thicker
cream I feel like it does more for my
skin when it's thick and I'm really I
don't know that's my own personal
preference I guess but not bad would I
repurchase probably not now if I were in
a pinch like maybe if I were in another
country and I saw it there and I needed
a night cream or just a face cream for
the week and I forgot to bring one I
would absolutely buy this because I know
it doesn't break me out it's still a
decent moisturizer it's just not my
favorite on to makeup my first empty is
this pure I polish this is in the shade
silk
I'm calling it an empty because it has
this little mesh thing and the cream
product below it when you push the thing
down it's supposed to get the cream onto
your finger and then you can put it on
your eyes well it is completely like
dried up and a glop on the bottom I've
been storing this upside down it doesn't
matter I might like take an exacto knife
and cut the mesh mesh out and see so I
cut the mesh out
best I could there's still some falling
in it the product is just not quite what
it used to be I'll show you a swatch
right now it's really really beautiful
but again it's just not quite the right
consistency which makes me feel like
it's gone bad and so for that reason I
just think it's kind of time to call
time of death but I love that shade
would I rebuy that again absolutely
however I almost wish now that they
would just make it in a smaller pot
without the mesh so I could really
really get use out of the product
because I feel like it was cool at first
kind of gimmicky and fun but the end of
the day you know I couldn't get to the
rest of the product anyway I feel like
I'm just going around in circles but I
loved that product next product that's
empty is my Christian Dior creme de Rose
lip balm this stuff was really expensive
it was a nice lip balm was it mind
blowing no did it like heal my lips
forever no so is it worth the price
absolutely not will I ever buy it again
absolutely not um I don't know like I
feel like I wanted to try it because I
was like oh it's so amazing it's only
worth the money no it is not absolutely
it is a great lip balm but there are
tons of amazing lip balms in the
drugstore my favorite Knight balm is my
favorite lip balm it's litter cold my
favorite night balm by Co bit low you
guys know I love that it had this strong
rose scent which if you like roses I
mean it's like a very pure rose scent
that I don't really like the smell of so
I didn't love that part of it either so
for those reasons I'm done with it and
I'm not buying it again next empty is my
hourglass 1.5 millimeter eyeliner their
mechanical gel eyeliner it's an obsidian
and it's this tiny tiny haven't found
one this small at the drugstore tiny
little eyeliner I found one that's close
that I'm kind of toying with being a
dupe they sell these in three packs I
think I just need to buy I know I keep
saying that I just have not done it um I
love it so much I love how thin it is
it's super creamy it'll stay in your
waterline if you want it to I mean like
if you want to put it in your waterline
um I just love it I have their other
shades and they're just as good like if
you like gray or brown they're also good
but you will fly through it and so it's
like for the price tag it's like I feel
like I can't keep buying these but I
love them so much next product is my
Anasazi
Brow's and medium-brown I cannot believe
I'm already done with this one keep
trying like thinking oh maybe it'll come
up no but the other side is the spoolie
it's just a really great thin pencil
brush I do think that the ones that are
in the drugstore that are really thin
like this are actually pretty close and
pretty good so if you don't have the
money to buy this but you want a really
thin precise brow pencil you can find
that in the drugstore I also have an it
cosmetics superhero mascara that's an
empty it's my favorite expensive mascara
I finally found a drugstore one I really
like which is the essence lash princess
I like that one it's very very similar
to this and it's like 1/4 of the price
but I do I have already bought another
one of these because I really did love
it it's what I'm wearing today and I
feel like it just curls your lashes
volumizes it holds it all day every time
I wear this people like are you wearing
fake lashes I'm like no but I love it so
I just do and I wish it was less
expensive but it is one of those
products that I'm like it's worth the
money every time because I love using in
the morning I love the way it looks even
by the end of the day it's just amazing
so those were all of my empties for the
past month month and a half ish if you'd
