my October favorites and least favorite
products I have a lot to show you so
here we go so one of my absolute
favorites that I've just kind of
rediscovered I've been using but I I
guess I was thinking about it and what
my favorites were and I was like I love
this brush it's the Real Techniques
powder brush really you know a simple
powder brush but the way that its shape
and its density it's not too dense it's
a really nice full brush and so when you
use it it just gives a really flawless
finish with your powder and I feel like
the denser powder brushes which I have
some that I really love but they are
denser I feel like it's a very
concentrated amount of powder so it's
just a kind of a thicker look on your
face whereas this is just a really nice
dusting so especially if you don't
really have that oily skin you just have
a little bit of oiliness this is great
with powder I really like it another one
that I have just rediscovered is my
Revlon nearly naked foundation and this
one I wear in the shade 120 vanilla and
I've had it for a while and I kind of
use it off and on but I've been using it
everyday because I was battling some dry
skin and it really helped to kind of
clear it up and every time I wear this I
really my skin just feels like it can
breathe and it still gives a decent
amount of coverage moreso than a BB
cream or attented moisturizer would so I
just love it and I don't think I
realized how much I loved it I know a
lot of people don't like this product
and some do but I was kind of
wishy-washy for a while until I really
thought about it and realized I really
do like the way this looks on my skin
now I don't have very oily skin like I
said so if you do have a way they skin
you probably won't like this if you also
if you like really really full coverage
you also won't like this so there's that
to consider but I just really really
liked it and 120 vanilla it might be the
most perfect shade for me if only
everything had a 120 vanilla because
it's it's perfect okay a product that I
have not been loving would be this all
may I makeup remover there the oil-free
eye makeup remover pads they come in a
little thing like this and I can't use
them anymore I talked about I think at a
recent haul video or something like that
that I can't use
them I discovered when I traveled they
broke me out I had horrible dry skin I'm
still kind of dealing with it so I
haven't been able to wear concealer so
like today I'm not wearing concealer
anything so no but I can't use them I'm
sad because I've used these for a long
time when I travel and they're so
convenient but that would be why my skin
always feels so dry around my eyes when
I travel hmm I don't know how it took me
that long to figure it out but it did
okay another thing the physicians for
Formula quad and Canyon classics it's so
simple it's just these four shows but
there's something about them they're all
matte first of all this quad is only
like four dollars and they're just so
very buttery shadows for sure but these
colors together are such create such
nice looks you can really darken it up
for night time or just daytime using
these colors and just using maybe even
using this in the outer corner during
the day they're just so simple and
pretty and matte and it's so hard to
find a collection of matte colors that
are actually wearable for around five
dollars at the drugstore I don't know
why I don't know why no one makes matte
shadows you know what I mean like for
real why are they so hard to come by
you'd think people would want that I
don't know doesn't matter anyway I've
been reaching for matte shadows because
I had dry skin up there the shimmery
ones were just enhancing so for a while
I just didn't wear any shadow and then
once it started healing I was just
sticking to matte shadows so that's how
I rediscovered this and I love it
and every time I go a while without
using it and then use it again I'm like
oh man it's just it's the bomb another
product I've been loving is the Mac
blush and well dress it's one of their
satin powder blushes and it's just a
really pretty pink blush really simple
but it's not shimmery so like kind of
for everyday it might be my favorite
blush for everyday like ever because it
it stays on all day I'm wearing it today
and it's just so simple idea maybe the
word I should choose is elegant and so
well dress is a really good title for it
because it really it makes me feel
really put together and not so
in-your-face
so I really like that another product
okay I have a few lip products what I'm
wearing on my lips today is Mac's angel
which I have a swatch actually right
here already I tried to film this video
and then my little pug Simba was like
shaking the camera and stuff so I had to
get him out of here and redo it but that
is it it's just a pretty pink but I've
been wearing it and I am today with this
lip gloss at the Revlon Super Lustrous
and pango peach I'll put a little more
on it's just really simple and like a
really nice peachy color a little a
little much but it's nice they wear off
really well you know what I mean so I
really like it I don't think it's not
like the Holy Grail lip gloss but I
really do like the color a lot with my
skin tone and I love Max angel this
month okay a product that I have not
been loving the l'oreal infallible
shadow and now i have a lot of them and
i love most of them but this one it's
strawberry blonde and i took me forever
to find this one and it's kind of like a
pinkish colored one and i might you
can't really tell the pink but it's got
these really cool tones in it and it
looks beautiful right swatches
beautifully however you can't really see
this swatch like on my hand so I'm not
gonna bother but when you put it on your
eyes at least for me in my skin tone it
makes me look tired all day
now pink shadows are kind of known to
make you look a little tired and make
your eyes look red but the shimmers that
are in this make it even worse so the
few times I've worn this like usually
I've worn it on my lid with other stuff
and every time I look in the mirror like
later in the day I'm like ah I hate the
way it looks so I'll probably still try
and incorporate it everyone's well but
maybe in a different way because I have
not like the way it looked on my eyes at
all so we'll see what I end up doing
with that mmm so a L'Oreal infallible
shadow that I love is eternal sunshine
it's this beautiful gold color did I
already here I'll swatch it on this
finger look at that it's like BAM I know
I say that a lot but here it is right
here if the shimmer will pick up it's
just really pretty it's almost a dupe
for Urban Decay's half-baked which is my
favorite herb indication
don't ever and it happens to be in both
of the naked one and naked two pallets
probably because Blaziken people love it
so I really really liked that one so
it's almost a really nice drugstore dupe
you do have to be careful with these
though with fall out so you want to make
sure you you know you're not going crazy
with it cuz it is still kind of a
pigment so you know make sure you don't
get too much follow up I have one of
those little shields and I actually use
it when I apply them I might look silly
doing it but at least I'll have glitter
everywhere
okay another product I've been loving is
this maybelline color whisper and strike
a rose I think I've already talked about
this but it's right here it's just kind
of like a really nice sound silly rose
color I really I feel like I talked
about this one every time or maybe I
haven't but I love this one this one in
lust for blush are my two favorite color
whispers they're pretty much in my purse
all the time speaking of purse let me
know if you want to see an updated
what's in my purse video cuz I made one
and if I remember to I'll link it below
but it was like when I first started my
channel which really was only back in
April wasn't that long ago but it's just
funny to see already it's funny to see
how it's kind of changed I'm still the
same but like it a settings kind of
changed it's just fun anyway so I'm
thinking about doing it updated one but
let me know if you want to I'm not gonna
I mean it wasn't that long ago so I'm
not gonna have no one want me to
honestly but anyway okay
another product I fell in love with the
Revlon lash potion when I first tried it
I liked it but I didn't love it and I
was like I'm not gonna repurchase this
you know but I this is one you just have
to let it dry out for awhile and then
you will love it I love this stuff adds
so much volume once it's dried out a bit
it's beautiful who knew I mean really I
really was like it's okay it does have a
humongous brush so if you don't like big
brushes you won't like this one but it's
nice and I actually how about this shade
black and brown which I usually just get
black or blackest black but I actually
kind of like it in this shade too so go
figure I'm changing people I've changing
so um okay no I'm gonna show you I'll
show you this one first the color
tattoos I forgot about him I have a lot
of them and I completely forgot and I
opened my drawer in Somme and I was like
what
so I pulled my out my favorite which is
barely Brandon is just a really pretty
shimmery champagne or pearl color and
they're just so pretty they say on all
day they're creamy they do I think they
say you're supposed to store em upside
down like to help but I storm sideways
they've been fine
you know so I don't know but I really
really like this color it's just such a
really nice I wore it today on my lid
just to prime that area instead of using
an eye primer okay a product I have not
been liking and this is a huge
disappointment the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer I got it a while ago and I
haven't the shake nude which is dark for
me now but in this summer it works out
pretty well actually
but first of all the packaging what like
this is twist-off so this cap part just
came off I was like seriously and this
is some really expensive product I got a
good deal on it but still it's a very
expensive product so it has an SPF of 20
if I didn't say it's definitely a
lightweight coverage it is a tinted
moisturizer but there's something about
it on my face that I just don't like it
it makes it feel like you can't breathe
which makes no sense because it's a
tinted moisturizer so I don't know what
it is but every time I look at on my
face I'm like I don't really like the
way it looks and I can't really pinpoint
it it I don't know it doesn't really
oxidize throughout the day on me but it
just makes my skin look dull so I don't
know I really don't know what it is
about this but I wouldn't waste my money
on and if I were you there's a lot
better tinted moisturizers out there
that don't cost like 40 something
dollars another product I have been
loving is this covergirl pencil it's
their one of their flamed out pencils
don't know the shade I talked about this
one all the time it's right here if you
can see that it's like this peach color
it's like a shimmery peach and I wear it
under my eye all the time on my lower
lash line that is and I just love it it
wears all day it's a beautiful kind of
shimmery color adds a little dimension
there without being kind of you know
bright and I love them and so when I run
it I want to get the gold version they
have of this and when I ran out of this
I would be repurchasing it
I've been grabbing it every single day I
just love it I don't even want to use
anything else okay a product I also love
the blistex restore and revive little
duo
this is so cool to me because they come
together I actually got it at Big Lots
for like a couple bucks but they snap
together if you want or they're separate
you're supposed to use the restore one
at night because it's got vitamin E nor
a lot of moisturizing ingredients see I
put that on at night and it smells like
a candy necklace exactly like a candy
necklace and if you have this you're
gonna laugh because that's it right
ladies but it's mostly candy got awesome
then the daytime one has SPF of 15 and
this one smells minty so it's kind of
nice during the day when you want to
smell minty you know that is really nice
I've used the restore one much more
because I love wearing it at night when
I wake up in the morning my lips are
almost just like they're like soft and
juicy that sounds weird I know but my
lips literally look fuller in the
morning I don't know and I've already
got big lips as it is so it's pretty
awesome I really like this duo I'm
assuming they're sold in regular stores
too but if not look at Big Lots and I'm
gonna go back and see if there's more
because I want another one of these cuz
I like it okay a product I hated this
Victoria's Secret shimmer fierce liner
duo it looks like this what is this oh
it's in the shade smoking mirrors I
already have them swatched right there
there's the silver and there's the light
charcoal color umm they're beautiful the
charcoal ones okay and it wears okay
throughout the day it's not it's not
great the silver one I put it on my
lower lashline I had glitter all over my
face at the end of the day I was like I
looked ridiculous and I was like I was
like come on you know like and I didn't
have like anything in my purse with me
for whatever reason to help touch up
that day so I was like of course of all
days it was just mm so I was very
disappointed and it's not even gonna try
it again now I've had this for a while
but I remember that it was kind of and
when I first tried it that it was kind
of patchy the silver one was and that's
why I bought it I like the silver side
okay so those were all of my favorites
and least favorites of the month I hope
it was enjoyable and informative and
I'll catch you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
