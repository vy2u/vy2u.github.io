share with you guys my October favorites
and my flop so let's go and get into it
so I have a couple high end flops should
we start with those like that's my
favorite part of favorites videos is
when people tell me what they hated
especially if it's an expensive one I'm
like thank you for saving me money and
of course sometimes these work for other
people the two that are mentioning are
actually high-end foundations so it's a
very personal thing depending on your
skin tight of your skin tone what you
want your skin to look like at the end
like there's so many contributing
factors that it's really hard for me to
just make a blanket statement and say oh
this foundation is terrible cuz it's not
terrible for everyone so first one was
sent to me from Clinique and you guys
know what it doesn't matter if it's sent
to me or not I'm gonna tell you tell you
what like it is this is the Clinique
super balance silk makeup SPF 15 I have
it in the shade soap Sahara which
actually is not a bad shade match for me
at all I don't like the packaging
straight up it needs something I don't
understand why packaging like this is
still being made why is this so why is
there not a pump or like the other
clinic one that I have let me grab it
like this other clinic one I have is
there beyond perfecting the shade match
is actually really bad it's not a good
match this is one I actually bought
myself but it has been apparently I
don't know how to shave match myself but
really if I bought it online
stop Jessica you're getting off on a
tangent anyway but it's got this giant
doe foot applicator which I actually
like I know some people like oh you're
putting like the bacteria from wherever
you're placing it right into the bottom
like yeah but I just like it
but the shade is all wrong for me but
this one it just breaks up like I it's
hard to apply because of the bottle but
you can get beyond that it's not a big
deal but just like I would put it on and
I would need like three layers so I'm
like okay so it's not a high coverage
foundation that's fine again not
everyone wants that so not every
foundation is like that but super
balanced no like my skin broke up I
looked crazy oily and dry all at the
same time like it was the weirdest combo
and it just didn't cover enough and what
it did cover like a couple hours later I
would look in the mirror at work and I
was like oh my gosh I look crazy like
what foundation
today and every time I thought that it
was always this so I'm like okay didn't
love it I think if you have really
really dry skin it might work because I
do think it because I'm kind of combo it
just really drew out the oils in my skin
not in a good way because I like to look
kind of glowy and dewy but this was just
too much and then on top of that it just
did not look nice that's just me the
other one I did not like was this Urban
Decay all nighter one and I'm so sad
about it I think I'm gonna return it
unless somehow I can find a way to make
it work but I guess my skin is too dry
for this because it's a really high
coverage foundation and that's why
people love it and I have it by the way
in the shade 3.0 which even still I
think it's like - way too light for my
skin even just looking at it there so
that's part of it but you can get beyond
that again it's not that bad actually
maybe it's not too bad but it sticks to
every dry patch you have oh my gosh
right away - and I felt like no matter
how I applied it especially my favorite
method of applying is with a brush so
when I can find a great find a great
foundation that applies well with the
brush I'm all-in because to me it's
quicker in the morning I can just dot it
all over my face blend it in and move on
whereas the Beauty Blender you got to
get it wet so it's very rare for me to
actually grab a Beauty Blender and use
it in the mornings on a weekday but it
just it clung to everything dry I didn't
feel like it blended very well with the
brush it did okay with the Beauty
Blender but of course if beauty blenders
that kind of not washes it out but kind
of sheers it out so I don't know I I
wanted to try it some more because I
feel like there's got to be a reason
everyone is loving it so much so if
you've had a similar experience with
this let me know or if you found a way
to make it work really really well
if not I think I am gonna return it just
because I'm just like I feel like I
should get a better foundation for the
same price I'm really sad too because
the packaging is really cute and I'm
that shallow so I would say out of my
favourites I've got one two three four
five that are drugstore and three
they're high-end so I've got a kind of a
mix here so the foundation I'm upset
is this elf flawless finish foundation I
can't believe I found a foundation that
is perfect for my skin I've never gotten
so many compliments on my face on my
facial skin then when I wear this like
it's weird I in fact I don't know that
I've ever really been complimented like
wow your skin looks really nice today or
while you're but with this like people a
lot of people are saying what foundation
a Wednesday it looks really nice are you
you know what did you do differently
your face looks different I'm like oh my
gosh like what was I looking like before
that this is so starkly different but I
don't know what it is it's almost as if
you got kind of combo normal ish but
maybe dry in spots come you know oil in
spunk this is gonna be perfect now if
you're crazy oily I still think this
would work if you're crazy dry honestly
I kind of feel like this would just work
for everything it is so amazing it's got
a pump and you you know I just pump it
on I do it with a brush so it works
really well with a brush but it's just
flawless coverage I'll usually use more
than one layer though I'll usually use
like two layers of it but it just looks
amazing it looks like it's your skin I
mean it looks like it's your skin but
just flawless just perfected and I've
noticed at the end of the day my skin
looks exactly the same I have never felt
the need with this when I get home like
we'll go to trivia on Monday nights so
when I come home from work on Monday I
usually will sit down and kind of touch
myself up before we go out but I've
never had to touch up like my face when
I'm wearing this it's almost as if it
locks in everything so I am I cannot
speak highly enough about this how
surprised I am and how much I love the
next product I actually bought and I'm
filming today a haul but I bought this
like a couple weeks ago and I liked it
enough that I'm like it's going on my
favorites I don't care this is the
Physicians Formula natural nude little
like highlighting brick if you will I
don't know if that's actually what it's
called but oh it's just there's shimmer
strips um well they have like a little
brush and stuff in the back which I
haven't even open to be honest so now
I'm wearing this today I love this and
it's been a while since I brought bought
something from Physicians Formula but
it's just this very nude but also
at all shimmery highlight you know you
can get it to be a little bit lighter if
you go up here a little bit deeper
I usually just swirl together it doesn't
really matter to me on my skin but it's
just gorgeous and it stays on all day it
catches the light so beautifully you
know you could go through and get
individual ones I know some people talk
about using it as a shadow you totally
could like I just got three very
different shades here let me see if I
can't watch him yeah so like there's
there's three the shades right there
just gorgeous
separately altogether I think the
packaging is cute I just can't believe
it's taken me this long to try it I'm so
excited about it if you've tried to need
their other like shimmer strip type
products let me know what other ones I
should try because I'm very impressed
it's very smooth and buttery as well so
a high-end favorite of mine is this Kat
Von D locket concealer cream this stuff
is so good and I'm gonna be honest I'm
very new to the Kat Von D makeup world I
I this might be the first cap on
anything I've ever actually just
purchased and I have it in the shade l7
warm and the doe foot looks like a
normal dopa but it's kind of got this
like triangular shape and it's jut I
almost don't want to waste it it's just
beautiful it blends so easily
it's not too thick but it's thick enough
to actually cover something you know I
feel like the original Lockett concealer
seems to be much thicker than this and
it's got even I would say even higher
coverage but this has really really good
coverage and yet it's so light I don't
know how to describe it but I was so
impressed I thought I might like it but
I didn't think I would be like in love
with it now I still haven't tried the
Tarte shaped tape so I know I've got to
get that one that's kind of on my radar
because again I'm like the only person
in the world I feel like I'm YouTube
that hasn't tried it but I just have it
so very excited about this can't stop
using next thing is the skincare
favourite this is the Olay micro
sculpting cream of sunscreen now I am
trying this actually because I'm in
talks with Olay to do a video of them
this one
not with them they have no idea I'm even
talking about it but I have fallen in
love with this stuff and so now I'm like
yes I will totally do a video about this
it is this it's basically a moisturizer
but it has SPF in it and that is why I'm
obsessed with it because it's the only
SPF moisturizer I try not only but the
best one I've tried where it doesn't
make your skin looking like a grease
ball because my problem is I'm like I
want to wear SPF everyday
and not every foundation I own it has
SPF built into it so I would like to
wear it year-round all the time because
you should but every single one I tried
is just a little bit too oily and so
your skin just looks a little bit crazy
underneath you know your primer and
foundation and all this stuff it is the
most beautiful base it like this is
something that like I'm treating as
makeup like I don't I know I called it I
mean it's obviously skincare but I'm
treating it as like makeup because it's
the stuff I do right before my primer
and I am so obsessed so it's got like I
said SPF of 30 and it's just a white
sunscreen but it's just so beautiful and
luxurious I'm excited to do that video
for you guys so you can see kind of how
it works because it oh and it smells so
good oh my gosh it smells so good - it
smells like like something really clean
it does not smell like sunscreen at all
which again I really like so love this I
think the packaging is perfect thin it's
got a pump I'm all in for it but you
should definitely check it out if you've
been looking for one because even in the
winter you gotta protect your skin you
had protected alright moving on okay I
realized I have a lot of elf favorites
because I recently got a lot of their
stuff so I've been trying a lot of it
out and there are just a couple standout
products if you're interested in me
doing just like an elf
best and worst update video I've done
tons of elf best and worst videos but if
you want a new one let me know below or
maybe give this video a thumbs up so I
know because I've got a lot of newbies
but one that I'm wearing today on my
eyes is this one it's the long lasting
luscious eyeshadow in soiree it's so
pretty it's just this really pretty
can't stop saying pretty it's this
breathtaking kind of light pink
it's got like kind of a purplish maroon
tint to it and it has
glitter but the glitter is so micro so
small that it doesn't get everywhere
because this is kind of more of a
cream-based but it's almost like a cream
to powder kind of you don't really know
how to describe it but it works well on
top of other shadows on its own today I
put it on top of shadow but it's just so
beautiful it catches the light well and
again this is one of those things that
when I've worn it even to work you're
like ooh what is that that you're
wearing because it is kind of different
specially if you see it in person let's
go ahead and talk about the other elf
one they have a bunch of new brushes and
I've been trying a lot of mountain I
love a lot of them but this is my I
think my favorite I don't know what it's
called I'll put it on the screen right
now but it's this giant powder brush and
there's something about it the way I use
powder brush I use it very rarely for
actual powder I use them to whisk away
extra eyeshadow whatever it is that
might have you know any fallout I've got
this is so amazing because it's so
floppy it's really soft but it's so
floppy and big that it just works
perfectly for that and I know that's
such a random thing to like a powder
brush for button it's just my reality
I've never found a brush as good at
wiping away fallout as this brush is so
I love it all their new brushes are
really nice that's another one if you'd
be interested in me doing a video about
their brushes I can do that alright
another high end oh actually I've got
another high end kind of meant it's not
a bad product but I wanted to mention it
because it's just like a kind of a thing
this is the benefit roller lash mascara
I don't hate it by any means I'm wearing
it today and I will use the whole thing
up but a lot of people looks like their
Holy Grail now the packaging is adorable
this is kind of rubberized and then this
is plastic it just looks like a little
hair roller and it's so cute I don't
mind the brush at all I like that it's
kind of firm and it's got like just like
little silicone I guess bristles and you
you know it'll separate your lashes
pretty well but I don't feel like for me
and volumizes and holds the curl as much
as I want it to so it's not a bad
mascara I'm wearing today I think it did
alright but I feel like I've tried
better and this is one that you know
it's still pretty pricey so I don't know
that it's necessarily worth the price
point so I've got a lot of mascaras
queued up to try after this but I do
want to use this up before I open
anything else but I figured it might be
worth my
if you've been thinking about buying it
I think if you like just kind of not
natural lashes but kind of more just
kind of flirty natural but not really
volumize or lengthen or anything like
that then you might like it that sounded
terrible but this next thing if you've
noticed my brows looking a little better
than usual at least in my opinion and I
know a lot of you guys have told me wow
your brows look much more
I don't know defined a little bit more
they're never going to be even I mean
they're not the same brow but anyway
this is the Anasazi a dip brow pomade
yes I'm finally trying this out and yes
it is as amazing as everyone says it is
I thought why would this be that amazing
and I didn't get it like I'm like I
don't want to cream on my brows like
that's gonna be way too dark really hard
really messy to apply no it is not hard
to apply and it is not messy and it
stays all day I don't even use brow gel
anymore I used to use brown Jo every
single day I haven't used it in months
well or at least I should say a month or
so since buying this so I just used like
a little I have the Anasazi a dual brush
where it's led the little like angled
thin brush and then the other side is
fully so I just apply it brush it
through kind of clean the edges just a
little bit and that's it and I feel like
I'm looking at myself in the viewfinder
I feel like they look so much better
than they used to because with pencils I
still like pencils I still use them but
I feel like this is a much more even job
for me it's much more consistent day to
day I don't know so I'm shocked that I
like it because I was so against it not
against it but I do want to compare this
to like the NYX one I have in a couple
others so I'll have to let you know I
know elf has one I haven't tried yet
either but but I do really like it so if
you're thinking about it it might be
worth trying I hope you'll subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye
