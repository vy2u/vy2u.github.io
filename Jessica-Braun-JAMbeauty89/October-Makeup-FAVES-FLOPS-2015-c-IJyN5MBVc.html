going to be sharing with you some of my
favorite makeup and beauty items from
this path past past month of October one
of my favorite months I think it's a lot
of people's favorite month just because
it's like fall is beginning but it's
also like just an exciting time because
we know Christmas is around the corner
too so it's just all good so I have a
lot of good things but I I know that I
have at least two actually we'll make it
three maybe even four a seat like it
keeps adding up I also have a drugstore
haul to film today but two of the items
in the hall we're total done so I might
mention them today - five does this is
the most I've ever had one two three
four five oh well it is what it is so
let's go and get into them
so the first dud is what I'm wearing my
lips I really really like the color and
I've got a mirror here
it's crazy drying this is the MUA which
is makeup Academy which is new in the
States it's been around in the UK for a
long time um I don't know exactly the
name of the product I'll list it right
here on the screen because it doesn't
say I'm here but it's in the shade
number 202 rose and it's kind of like a
matte dry formula so it goes on kind of
wet and creamy like all those liquid
lipsticks that are out and it's a
beautiful color like I said but I just
put it on like it dries really fast I
put this on maybe 10 or 15 minutes ago
so the good news is it doesn't move but
it is so dry I don't know like I keep
having to lick the inside of my lips to
kind of make it so it's just a really
gross feeling you so I don't know if
it's because I don't love liquid
lipsticks in general I love the way they
look but I hate the way they feel so I'm
still trying trying to find one that I
really really like that is a little more
comfortable I know that because they dry
they're kind of bow
to not be comfortable but this one is
one of the most uncomfortable ones I've
tried so but I really like the shade so
I'll probably still wear it another dud
is the packaging the little brush that's
on here
the hairs keep splitting like literally
the second time I used it it was a mess
so I don't know it's one that you know
I'll probably use it because I have it
but I don't know if it's one that I'm
gonna buy more colors in so um one of my
favorites though lick wise is one that's
also kind of a liquid lipstick kind of
this is a power lick lasting and
moisturizing Gua stain but this one is
not as glossy as you'd think it's by
Milani and it's in the shade raspberry
tart I bought this at the Dollar Tree
but they're still sold at normal stores
too it's got a brush as well with the
brushes a little almost like tougher so
the things aren't going anywhere but
this shade and the formula is so nice
it's this kind of purply shade here it
doesn't have a smell well it kind of has
a minty smell now that I'm smelling it
but I said it kind of is like minty tea
but I it's a comfortable stain it does
stay in your lips kind of but I say kind
of because it's still kind of glossy so
it's not like it's staining like the
Revlon balms things do this one kind of
stains but I would just say it dries
down a little bit more than this it's
not as matte it's like the MUA one but
it's kind of close but it does have a
gloss so I can't call up like a liquid
lipstick in that way a liquid matte
lipstick anyway I love it I found mine
at the Dollar Tree like I said I bought
every shade I could find and they're all
beautiful so awesome awesome awesome
now another lip favorite will dust you
all my lips lip favorites this is the
NYC expert last lipstick in 442 bury me
and I am actually going to be putting up
if it's already up I'll link it a lip
swatch video of like a bunch of these
from this line because I love them but
it's right there it's just kind of a
satin looking lipstick really creamy
really really pigmented but I love this
color as we're going into November
I just think it's so pretty but it's
still it's very like but it's still
wearable which is I think
I like it so much and I've been wearing
that a lot since I got it
in the last whip favorite this month is
this Milani one called mapped darling I
love the Milani matte lipsticks and this
is one of my favorites in the line I did
just do and it's already up a lip swatch
video of these I can link up like five
or six shades from the Milani matte line
they're like five dollars at the
drugstore and they're so pretty they're
so comfortable and creamy one of my
favorite matte lipstick lines that I've
ever tried but I just loved this shade
it's just again an everyday kind of
pinkish shade these are all kind of
similar these two are similar
anyway okay let's move on okay I have
one more lip thing this this is a
favorite of mine this is the Knux rather
de miel hopefully I said that right my
French subscribers when I was in Paris
this past summer for my honeymoon I
wanted to and if you've watched our
vlogs of us in Paris on Tyler's channel
I was searching for the Knux brand lip
products but I couldn't find it so I
ended up once I was back in the states
ordering this on Birchbox calm now I've
seen nuts on targets website so I don't
know if it's in Target stores as well
but this is like this honey like thick
lip balm and I mean thick but I wear it
every single night and I put it on in
the morning when I'm getting ready and
it just sinks in my lips are so much
more moisturize than they ever used to
be and after I did those lips watch
videos I told you about I my lips were
really really really dry and just
crapped for like two days I put this on
it and I swear like overnight it fixed
it so I'm so glad that I did purchase
that I love it so much they have a stick
form too that's in my purse I like but
it's more just like throughout the day
you can put it on but I love this stuff
even more alright so a favorite let's go
into eyeshadow palette I have one
they're both high-end which you guys
know I mostly focus on drugstore but I
do
since I have high-end I like to tell you
about if it's worth the money or not or
if there's like drugstore equivalents so
I have one high-end palette that I loved
this is the Stila in the light palette I
bought this I think this is a $40
palette but I bought it for $20 on
HauteLook calm
where I always get crazy deals on
high-end makeup because I don't know
it's a lot of money to spend and unless
I'm like going out and intentionally
splurging on one item that I've like
research for a long time
I'm just not apt to spend that much on a
palette anyway
I love this palette it's one it took me
a while to get into it and I'm not
really sure why because these light
shades are right on my alley do you guys
know obviously I like neutral eye looks
this shade list here in the middle is
absolutely beautiful just as an all-over
crease color kitten is in here which is
a favorite of mine it's a cult classic
just a really shimmery champagne color
these are crazy pigmented bubbly is
gorgeous it's like a gold so both of
those are beautiful on the lid but then
they have this shade sunset which is
this gorgeous like Amber shade I'll
swatch these for you guys I don't know
if that's doing it any justice but
they're so beautiful all of these they
have a matte black and a matte Brown
sorry I know I keep looking in the
viewfinder I'm trying to like make sure
you guys can actually see it with the
light then they have this like matte
cream which is beautiful for under your
brow bone I mean it's literally got
everything you can want and then they
throw in this like blue and this grey
which are gorgeous for a smokey eyes so
this is a great travel palette I'm going
to London in December and I'm trying to
decide what palette I want to bring this
is definitely a contender because it's
gorgeous the palette that's it done but
it's only a dud
because it's one that I don't have a use
for myself and I know if some people are
gonna just be so mad at me but this is
the Urban Decay vice palette I thought
it was like vice with the number but
Urban Decay sent this to me and you know
they sent me a box of things and I lost
my mind like I was tearing out that I
was I cannot believe that this company
even knows who I am let alone is willing
to send something to me so I'm grateful
it's not that I'm not grateful because
some of the other things they sent me I
lost my mind they sent me said their
lipsticks and they're amazing but this
is one that when I saw it I was like oh
my gosh this is gonna be amazing and in
true urban decay fashion the shadows are
amazing they are crazy pigmented I'll
show you some of the you're gonna die
when I show you some of these look at
these I mean they are crazy pigments
crazy so that is not the issue the issue
is just that for me and my style it's
just not one and I know a lot of you
guys a lot of my subscribers are you
know you wear more neutral eyes and
that's why a lot of you follow me
because I'm kind of in every day I don't
know okay
maybe it's just that I'm boring but
because I am boring I just didn't love
this palette it's gorgeous the colors
are amazing well two of them three of
the shadows just fell out so that's
something they just completely fell out
you see that this one and then there's
two missing um that's weird I mean I
will just glue it back in so I've tried
like there are a couple neutral shades
like this one here this one here but I
just I can't get a complete look at it
but I always have to pull in from
another palette which is fine except for
for me when I'm rushing to get ready for
school morning that's not something that
I just would rather grab a palette go to
town and be done so for me and my money
if you're like me and you know you like
neutral eyes and that these are colors
that you probably would only wear once
in a blue moon I would say get like a
wet and wild palette that's got some
vibrant colors in it that way you're not
breaking the bank but you're getting
those colors for when you want to play
with them but if you know you're like me
and everyday looks for you are just kind
of neutral you might not want to spend
your money because it is of course a lot
of money but it's an amazing palette so
it's not a total dud that's kind of in
between I think hopefully I explained
myself well with that one all right okay
let's do a favorite this one I did a
whole review and demo video this is the
least is the pure eye polish in satin I
love this stuff it's got that little
cushion one of my subscribers you guys
help me out I couldn't think of the word
for it's got a little cushion that you
can push in and you get this like it's
like a mix between a cream and a liquid
shadow more of a cream than a liquid but
it's this gorgeous crazy pigmented look
they have darker colors I can link the
video where I show them all the whole
line but this is just my favorite I wear
it all the time just on my lid I'll wear
it alone
just like
I'm quickly trying to go out but I still
want to look put together it looks
really nice just this with some winged
liner and mascara in like a high bun cuz
it just looks so effortless and like
really kind of ethereal if you will so I
love this shade so much it's my absolute
favorite it's the one that I I might
travel with this one as well cuz I love
it another favorite and this eye I know
I've got kind of a mix of high in a
drugstore in this one usually I'm more
drugs for heavy but this time that's
about half and half I love this stuff
this is the it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination in light now I'm
not I don't really powder my face often
at all but this was one that it's got a
little more coverage than I like so I
haven't reached for it however I
realized that like in this region where
I do need a little more coverage this is
gorgeous especially right here because
it kind of mattifies but because it's
this it's an illumination version of it
it adds like this beautiful satin look
to your skin I didn't put it on today
let me grab my brush and put some on I'm
just using this is a target up-and-up
brand powder brush that I love so I'm
just gonna put it right here and it just
like mattifies but it also like adds
this like I don't want to say glow
almost just like this like I said a
satin look to it and I think it is so
beautiful and I'm gonna be so sad when I
run out that I might repurchase it
because I've never tried a powder quite
like this oh my gosh I just love it and
I can't believe how much I love it so
definitely definitely a favorite I'm if
you know of a drugstore equivalent to
this where like I love my Rimmel stay
matte powder but it just mattifies a
little which I love but it doesn't add
that different look to it which I love
so I just said which I love way too any
time sorry guys I hope you're enjoying
all these duds because I feel like I've
never had this many but it's helpful in
its own way so this is a morphe brush
that I bought I bought a bunch on
HauteLook and so they were pretty cheap
it's the in 405 this is kind of you know
like a smaller blush brush I've been
using it for highlight actually and I've
been using it for the past few weeks but
ever since I opened it and especially
since I've watched it but even when I
first opened it they're just really dry
and like the
whistles are just coming out everywhere
and when I use it it feels like it's
kind of just like abrasive on my skin
I've tried other morphe brushes that
weren't that way but this one and I
tried like a bronzer one from them and
it was the same thing really really
rough so I don't know it's not that I'm
not saying all more if you brush your
back because I have a few that I love
some of their eye shadow brushes I love
but I the jury saw Alan on some of their
face brushes because they just I don't
know if maybe they were discontinued and
that's why they're on her look so if you
know let me know but it's in 405 and I
just I think I'm just gonna get rid of
it I don't I'm not enjoying using it and
I don't want to force myself to use it
when I've got plenty of other brushes
that I like better in the way this shirt
if you're wondering I got a target I
need to go back I love Target so much
but this shirt is so comfortable and of
course we all are loving the plaid right
now all right so another died I was so
excited about this one this is the
Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
mascara it looks like one of those
double-ended ones I think all of us
thought that's what it was when you
first bought it it's not but when I
first tried it I was like okay the brush
is like that rubbery
kind and I don't love that kind of a
brush but I thought I'm gonna give it a
try you never know so I'm all ready and
as I'm trying it out I'm realizing wow
my lashes look crazy they looked amazing
they were really pushed up I was so
impressed especially given that it's a
flexible brush I thought it wouldn't
push them up as much but it did so I was
so impressed they were saying you know
they were separated they were lengthen
they were semi volume eyes three minutes
later I looked and my lashes were like
straight I have never experienced that
and so I'm like what so I got a little
warm like well it's only been a couple
minutes let me do another layer so I did
and it kind of pushed him up a little
bit but then a couple minutes later they
were like straight I'm like this has
never happened so I thought well maybe I
don't know maybe something weird is
going on so I try to be and the next day
same thing I tried it a few more times
since then and I'm like okay I hate this
I wore it to work a couple days and I
every time I looked in the mirror they
looked crazy so I was like I'm done
it's not mmm I want to wait a little bit
longer until maybe it dries out to try
it again but then again I'm like I don't
even want to like I have no desire so
we'll see if I do all belong to it for a
little while longer but I was not
impressed which stinks kids at first I
was really impressed alrighty so well I
know Mahina all in my last favorite I'll
give my last favorite in a second one
last uh there are a million it's this is
the ship is it ship brand yeah
intuition shaver razor I was really
excited about this they've been out a
while but they've got the huge this is
actually a brand new thing cuz it came
with two but it's got like that
soap on it and around it so you know you
put it on and it's supposed to be super
moisturizing and all that stuff and I
was like this is pretty cool you know
like for your legs you don't have to
worry about putting on like another
shaving cream um so I'm trying to even
think how to describe what happened here
the soap wears off pretty quickly which
I kind of thought you know this is a lot
of money for this I wonder how long the
soap around it will last well it did
wear down pretty quickly I would say
after 2 or 3 shaves but on top of that
the it wears off unevenly of course so
like where you need it it doesn't stay
so then you've got soap all around but
it's not being used because the razor's
coming out so I mean it was just an odd
it's an odd thing and I was so excited
about it and I would say for the first
two shaves it was great everything after
that it was useless it was just a
regular razor but then there's nothing
around it like a typical razor would
have so I was not impressed I told
myself you know I think I'll save it
show you guys and then move on so yeah I
think I bought a different razor since
then alright in the last favorite this
is a long favourites video sorry you
guys or you're welcome it depends on
what you like this is the elf contour
palette I love this for a while you guys
know I'm an elf gal at heart I love this
so much because this contour shade right
here is amazing it reminds me it's not
the exact same but my favorite Kevin
Kwan sculpting powder medium it reminds
me of that as a very similar
kind of or grayish rather than warm and
then this yellowy
powder down here is really really
pigmented it kicks up a lot of dust but
I don't mind because it reminds me of
the here's kind of a mini swatch of
those two it reminds me of my favorite
their minerals well rested powder that
is I mean essentially it is dust it's a
loose powder and I love the way that
makes my undereyes loaf and that's what
I use today this reminds me of that but
it's more convenient because it's in a
powder form so I am so impressed I don't
really use these two ever really I never
do I should I mean they're again crazy
pigmented that'd be a good highlighter
use it a couple times they're okay but I
really really love these I wish they
would just come out I know I can take
these out but I keep saying I wish they
would come out with the duo of just
these two I would travel everywhere with
it and I know I could just take it out
put it in a Z palette but it's not quite
the same you guys know what I mean so
those are all my favorites and my flops
for this month let me know what your
favorites and flops have been and I can
leave my entire monthly favorites
playlist below if you're interested to
see more of what I've loved over the
past months really over the past two
years and it's interesting to see how
times have changed as well when I go
back and re-watch my old ones
