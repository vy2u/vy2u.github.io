whatever you're watching this you can
see that the makeup has worn off of my
chin but nowhere else what do I do to my
chin that the makeups worn off I like to
think that when I'm teaching I'm like
going like this all the time
maybe anyway maybe I'm like so today I
wanted to bring you along some more
decluttering and so this is a very
informal video but I also wanted to show
you what I recently picked up from
thredUP because I worked with them in
the past I'm going to work with them in
the future I'm working with them on this
video
I love thredUP and if you haven't tried
it and you've watched my other videos
they always give me a percent off code
for you guys which is awesome but
basically it's just a website with a
bunch of like new clothing it's all way
discounted and there's tons of designer
brands they have purses shoes clothing I
mean everything you can imagine but
what's awesome is like when I go to
consignment stores in real life it's so
difficult because it's hard to find
exactly what you're looking for and you
can filter it you know by your size and
not every consignment store is grouped
by size accurately and so it's awesome
to be able to like really quickly online
see it they let you know if there's any
wearing on it things like that so you
really know what you're getting but I
wanted to show you it I got this time
around before I declutter some more
stuff and I also wanted to show you my
closet and kind of the state of that
right now as well because I got rid of a
lot of stuff so I've already turned into
it because of course I have but they
always have really cute polka dot
packaging even the outer packaging is
cute but let's see so oh my gosh if you
can cuter in person so this first thing
I got is this little kind of like tunic
dress that I thought was so cute I love
like this blush color I love that it's
got these little cutouts and the sleeves
are like kind of bell sleeves I figure
it would be cute on its own but
especially in the fall with like
leggings and like brown boots oh my gosh
I'll put the original price for this on
the screen as well as the price they had
it for on thread up it's from Madewell
which in my opinion is a very expensive
brand so I am so excited about this one
and then the next piece that I bought I
was clearly like on a dress kick because
I do wear a lot of dresses to work even
if I'm wearing them like with the
cardigan so this was kind of this was
kind of a flowy red dress that you kind
of tie in the back which I thought was
cute but I thought I've got a navy blue
blazer that would look really nice with
this again I could wear
with leggings if I want or not but my
figure even on valentine's late like at
school i could wear this with a white
cardigan and that would be really sweet
this brand it was Victoria's Secret so I
thought that was pretty cool I've bought
some clothes from Victoria's Secret in
the past and they're usually pretty nice
so the next thing is from Old Navy and
yes it's like a tunic dress I'm clearly
like on a tunic kick but for me at work
it's so comfortable they can look so
cute but I loved the pattern of this
it just looked comfortable breezy and
yet again I could wear it with leggings
I would probably have to wear this with
leggings but I loved the pattern and
these look just like new like there's
nothing noticeably wrong with them or
anything like that
the next thing I got was this skirt and
I thought I liked that it was navy blue
and a little bit longer but I loved that
it had this tie here with the big like
almost like grommets you know I just
thought it was so different and I
figured it might be flattering up here
like at the waist and then kind of
flared out but it's long enough that I'm
not gonna worry that it's like too short
at work you know but I love navy blue I
think that'd be pretty with a white
puffy shirt tucked into it and this
brand by the way was Nanette Lepore so I
got these pink la mean they're black but
Victoria Secret pink leggings I go
through leggings a lot so I like buying
more and these felt like new I also got
some comfy clothes from Victoria's
Secret pink these are just like comfy
lounge pants but they flare out at the
bottom which I feel like I have a lot of
tight-fitting things but I really wanted
something looser to lounge around in
these are perfect and yet again they
feel like they're brand new
next was okay I know I'm being so boring
this is another pair of lounge pants
they're just really baggy comfy ones
they feel like they're in good condition
as well and these are also from yeah
pink
needed some more it was like time to get
rid of some old PJ's so I did get rid of
a lot then I also got these running
shorts I'm not gonna need them right now
but the brand is champion and I liked
the color I liked the gray and like the
magenta but I'm I only have two and I
just needed one more because I felt like
I was always in need of them when they
were in the laundry so that's awesome
and then see oh I got these shoes I
forgot I also got these shoes
and I just thought these were so pretty
and these are like literally in perfect
condition like it looks like someone
tried them on once and that was it so
it's the brand JustFab I love black and
white stripes I'm still obsessed with
them so I figured these would look cute
with so many different outfits and
they're the perfect size so that was
everything this month like I said I'll
have their percent off code for you guys
down below if you're interested in
trying it out it's awesome it's a way to
save money and get some fresh clothes in
your wardrobe I have not had a single
bad experience with them even before I
ever worked with them and so I just I
love the website I know a lot of you
guys use it and you're just like oh my
gosh and really look at your price range
and think about what you can afford cuz
I bought things on there that were just
a couple of dollars like it is amazing
the deals you can find so it's
definitely worth checking out and thank
you thread up for sponsoring this so I
wanted to show you my closet and kind of
where I'm at in the state of refreshing
that as well and then we'll go through
my shoes and purses and things so our
bathroom is a little bit messy but this
is kind of our bathroom if you've never
seen it and our closet is a work in
progress
so this is all of the shirt items that I
have kept I got rid of everything else
and then my like dresses then this is
like a costume for school and then my
pants are just right there now we are
planning to redo our closet completely
like with shelving and just completely
different stuff over the winter but
that's still a few months away so my
plan is to go through those accessories
up there all of these shoes I want to
get rid of that shoe thing it's really
old it's kind of falling apart I would
like to have less than 20 pairs of shoes
honestly I think I'd like to have 15
pairs of shoes I just don't need like
the stuff in these drawers I don't even
know what's in there I haven't even used
any of those things it doesn't make
sense to keep them and I also have these
purses that I need to get rid of as well
so let me pull these out and we'll go
through so this isn't even close to all
of them not even close but I figure
we'll just have to do it in shifts so
looking here what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
start my declutter as I typically start
my declutter
picking out my things that I absolutely
love that I wear all the time
I love these heels from Nine West I wear
them all the time so I'm definitely
keeping those these are my favorite pair
of like black kind of heels I wear them
all the time
well so I'm definitely keeping these
these are from 14th and Union these are
my two favorite pairs of sandals they're
both Steve Madden and I love they're the
exact same style but they're so
comfortable I love them so definitely
keeping those too so with that in mind I
think I can get rid of these I do like
these sandals really like them they're
so fun
that's what tears me apart I feel like I
would still wear these so maybe I should
keep them because I wore them this
summer a lot so I'm pretty sure I think
I might keep these as well these I
really like but they're not super
comfortable and I can't decide if it's
because I need to break them in or what
the brand is Melrose and market and I
really do like these so again I think I
want to try to break them in a little
bit more because I've only worn one two
or three times so I think it's way too
early to get rid of them yet got a
growth mindset these I just don't like I
think they're kind of dumb looking on me
they're a bad color for me so I'm
definitely gonna get rid of these got
about these I'm gonna get rid of these
they're all torn up there Madden girl
and they're just they get torn up so I'm
gonna get rid of these for sure but
these are the exact same style and I
haven't even opened them and they're
just a little bit better of a color I
love this kind of army green so I'm
gonna keep these and actually start
wearing them now definitely need flats
I'm obviously keeping these I just got
them you just saw me unbox them
I still love these I think I could see
like by spring me needing to throw these
away and replace them they look more
worn than I think they are cuz I just
recently got them but I love these shoes
so I'm definitely keeping them I wore
them like twice this week already
I think it might be time to call it a
day on these so these probably ran for
Target once I got a few years ago it's
time to go I did like those a lot though
so I have again shoes with tags so on
them these Sam Edelman ones but then I
also have these I bought I think I
bought them in Vegas when my heels were
killing me so I just bought these and
honestly I just don't own flip-flops so
I think I should own at least one pair
and since these have a fun memory
attached to them and they're pretty
comfy I figure I'll keep these I'm torn
about some of these oh these are brand
new black boots that I just got so I'm
definitely not getting rid of those I
know it doesn't seem like I'm getting
rid of a lot I promise I will it's just
I pulled out the shoes that I wear the
most first just to kind of get it over
with
I wear all three of these all the time
so these three
pairs of tennis shoes I am definitely
keeping I guess the good news is these
are all things that I know I like and I
know I wear I think this is these are
such cute boots so I'm keeping those
I'll get rid of the Sam Edelman ones I
wear these all the time too I wear these
to work actually these are Tom's they're
surprisingly comfortable so keeping them
now this is where I'm torn these again I
haven't broken in enough but they're so
pretty
they're like perfect for like if you're
cruising and you need something cute but
you don't want to heel
these are so pretty and again I've only
worn them like twice so I still feel
like it's too early to get rid of these
and these I just bought they're very
similar my other black heels but they're
a little bit dressier because they don't
have like the fake wood and I wore them
at my brother's wedding so I'm
definitely I think I'm gonna keep these
these are Moroni and they're still sold
at Target I love them so from that round
I got rid of one two three four pairs of
shoes we're gonna keep going I promise
I'll get rid of more okay next round I
have two pairs of slippers here these
are my new ones these are my old ones
I'm gonna get rid of these and keep the
other ones the let's see these are my
like genuine running shoes there's some
Brookes ones that I love and apparently
got my inserts in them and everything so
I'm definitely keeping these those are
my running shoes I use all the time
these are my old ones but I use them for
like painting and yard work and stuff
but I also have these old Nikes and
they're both I know they don't look that
crummy but I've already bought
replacement ones and I wash these in the
washer all the time so I think I might
get rid of this pair and keep this one
but put them downstairs like in the
garage for like yard work painting
things like that so then goodbye my
trusty pink Nikes I never wear these
they can go I did for a while but I
don't anymore I in fact I like these a
little bit more so I think I'll keep
these and I got rid of those kids I'm
gonna get rid of these sandals these I
just can't get to not hurt my feet but
again I've only worn in like two or
three times so I feel like I should
continue giving these a try before I get
rid of them because they're still pretty
new and they're so pretty these are all
they can go these don't feel good on my
feet
I've tried them away too many times and
it stinks cuz they're so cute but
they're gonna go these I've had for a
really long time let me check the the
wear on these I still love these so I
think I'm gonna keep them okay so I've
got some heels here these are so cute
but they don't fit my feet so I'm gonna
get rid of them I'm so sad cuz look how
freaking cute those are these I still
like a lot they're Fergalicious brand
and I really like those so I'm gonna
keep those these I'm gonna get rid of I
just didn't end up like him I wore him a
lot last winter but I don't know I just
they weren't the way I wanted them to be
so between these two black heels these
are I don't know I think these are just
more fun than these you know but then on
the other hand these are well I feel
like if I were wearing a black heel in
the winter time I would just wear my
black boots that have a heel and then
these would be like more black heels in
this summer so I'm gonna get rid of
these I've had them for a very long time
and I'm going to keep these as my black
heels and then these boots I wear a lot
I love that they're kind of that mid
length I clearly love boots have I been
wearing them with that tab on them all
along are you serious so this is the
last round as far as I know all my boots
so some of them that I keep because I
use but only in very specific situations
these are my snow boots I definitely
keep these these are from of they're so
warm they're so waterproof snow proof
it's amazing so I'm definitely keeping
those I'm gonna start putting them over
here though these are my rain boots from
Sperry I also wore these throughout
Ireland because it was very rainy when
we went and they were just so fun and
surprisingly comfortable and I loved
that this was a different color I just
think they're so cute they're simple but
cute um these I can get rid of they're
wonderful shoes from FRA but they've
just been loved for a long time and I
think it's just time for them to go my
UGG boots no matter what you say about
ugg boots I know they might be ugly out
of style whatever but these are so
comfortable and when I'm just like
running out to get the mail and it's
cold out I throw these on I go out in
them every once in a while if I'm like
running an errand
I'm just very basic and I wear you know
my black leggings I pick up my pumpkin
spice latte and I put on my UGG boots
obviously but they are just so
comfortable so I do actually
these quite a bit I'm not ashamed to say
it
so these I'm going to get rid of there
are those cute kind of boots that go
like over your knee except for they
don't stay up and I never wore them so
I'm sorry boots but goodbye now I've got
my tall boots I'm just gonna keep one
pair of these I think I'm gonna get rid
of these these are a nice brand they're
these are cole haan they're really nice
but I just feel like I've kind of
outgrown this style and I just don't
really want to keep them these are these
are ENSO angiolina
angiolina I don't know how to say it but
they're just classic Brown boots and I
do want to have at least one pair
because I do wear these all the time so
definitely gonna keep those and then I'm
down to these two now this black pair I
do I just bought this pair of black
boots so I don't feel like I need both
so I'm gonna get rid of these I'm gonna
keep the ones with a little bit of a
heel and then this pair I think these
are just so fun we always go camping in
the fall with our friends and I think
these are so fun for that they're comfy
you can like walk in them and hike in
them but they're also like warm so I
think I might still keep these I think
those are all my shoes now I've got dirt
all over the floor I need a vacuum okay
so let's go through my purse is here my
half the purse that I'm using I have the
first that I'm using now which is a
Vince Camuto purse that I love I just
think it's nice and simple very well
made so that as an obvious keep this is
one that I got from Target that I used
for a while I used it over the summer
it's a really cute one that's the fun
thing about Target you can get really
cool fun trendy purses for you know you
don't have to totally break the bank I
think I got this for like 25 bucks which
you know it's not super cheap but it's
also not crazy expensive which i think
is so fine this one was so cute but I've
certainly given it it's loved use at a
ton and I'm just ready to move on so I'm
gonna get rid of that and then this is a
purse I loved for a long time - it's a
Rebecca Minkoff one Rebecca Minkoff it's
so pretty it's so nice I don't think
there's anything wrong with it
necessarily I just got tired of using it
but it's a really pretty purse it's kind
of like a bucket style it's not too long
and it's got its dust bag time for me to
move on I don't need it now that you
know I
might be the same way as me like for
purses I wear them until I'm just done
with them so like if I'm done with the
style I don't typically switch back to
it I usually just move on
so that was one I'm gonna move on from
this wallet I'm gonna pass on it's a
Marc Jacobs one it's really nice again
nothing wrong with it I'm just moving on
I've gotten a different wallet that I
like so the past that one on Oh
oh my gosh my longshot bag I use all the
time actually I was looking for this
when we travelled last time and I
couldn't find it now I know where it was
definitely definitely keeping this one
this is one that I don't know I never
even use I got it for a song not long
ago and I'm just gonna pass it on it's
cute but I just never use it maybe I
used it once okay it's time to turn
turning the car for this one is that
even a phrase this Vince Camuto one I've
loved for years let me make sure there's
nothing in it I've loved this for years
so this one is definitely well-worn I'm
sure I don't have the dust bag for this
one anymore but I love it but it's gonna
go she's time to purge this one I bought
from Target and guess what never used
isn't that terrible literally never ever
used brand new so passing that one on
shame on me this one I'm gonna pass on
to and use this purse for a long time it
has like this separate thing that you
put inside and you can zip it up but
it's a really just a cute purse the
brand is Lotus very very nice but again
it's just time for me to move on then
here I have this Marc Jacobs purse that
hat it got this like little bit of blue
wear to it and like come on just from
like jeans but it's beautiful I love the
inside it's got its dust bag and it's
like little cards of authenticity that's
what I was willing to call it so I'm
gonna pass that one on and then this Ted
Baker one I loved for a long time too
it's I love that it's got this rose gold
and it just kind of close there this one
is a little bit more worn though I've
definitely used this one a lot but it
just opens up it's got a little bag
there so that was a good one too but
it's gonna move on so I'm basically
keeping only the person I'm using I'm
getting rid of
everything else now let's look at these
accessories here I have a ton get rid of
get rid of these are my two Disney hats
I'm gonna keep them both wrong pile get
rid of get rid of let's do these I think
I'm just gonna get rid of all of these
they're not nothing's wrong with them
you know oh I should get these things
out but this is a Rebecca Minkoff one
that I'm just kind of done with it's
their coin in there jackpot a penny so
getting rid of that this is a leaps
kimberlyn one I'm gonna get rid of get
rid of that one this is a Marc Jacobs
one I didn't think I'd like you so I'm
gonna keep this one I have a small one
yeah this is literally brand new
that's insane Jessica so I'm gonna put
all of these like random cards like I
have you have a CVS card and all that
kind of stuff I'm gonna put all these in
here to just be stored for now and so
when I switch to this the problem is I
don't have a pariah why I haven't used
it because I don't have a purse big
enough and I thought oh I'll get a
bigger purse to carry this but I haven't
yet so I'm gonna keep this for if I do
switch to a bigger purse I'll have the
wallet for so I'll take this one and
then the wallet I'm currently using so
these wallets are going to go another
bandana I mean I feel like I should keep
one so I need to decide which one
because these are good for like you know
we have costume days at school you know
spirit days and things so it's fun to
have something so I'm gonna think about
that
there it is my only umbrella definitely
keeping that this is our bronze fun time
campers hat that's fun all kinds of
sunglasses fanny pack can go I haven't
used any of these belts they're all just
gonna go Oh more bandanas are you
serious this can go it's just so funny
like there's a phone case with my name
on it
so these sunglasses those are pretty
cool I didn't even know I had these
they're not necessarily from this brand
I just have them in some of these faces
I remember wearing these all throughout
friends
a few years ago I didn't wanna get rid
of these I don't wear them they're
really fun they're from the two-faced
and key collection but I'm just gonna
get rid of them either just some like
flip-flop wines like some cheapo
sunglasses I like to throw these in my
car so I have some ones that are really
banged up in my car I think I'll just
throw those away and then put this in
there these are really fun so I think I
might let's see maybe I'll put those two
together in there and keep these okay so
this can go I have so many you know when
those big scarves are really popular I
have so many this is the color I don't
really like so I'm gonna pass this one
on I'm gonna pass this one I love it
it's really nice from j.crew but it's
just I don't really wear it I love this
is like the warmest most blankety scarf
I've ever owned where did I get it
Banana Republic I love it so I'm
definitely keeping this one and out of
these two I think I might keep this one
and get rid of this one they're all so
good I think I got this one maybe at
Target but you know if I ever really
miss that I can always buy another but I
just don't foresee myself missing it or
maybe I should keep this one and get rid
of this one oh Jessica you're never
gonna be able to make up your mind
because then I got this scarf that's
just like a you not unity scarf like a
infinity scarf I'm definitely gonna keep
that so let me think about both of those
I love both of these hats I wear them
all the time so def and it keeps for
those I'm gonna get rid of this scarf I
love this hat this can go it's old and
stained and weird this is kind of fun I
think I might eat that I don't think I
wore it last winter cuz I got it like
later in the winter I think that's so
fun so I think I'm gonna keep that too
now into like gloves and head wraps and
stuff more sunglasses those are cute oh
that's right I got these at Target I
love those
looking for them so I'm gonna keep this
is like a head wrap thing I really like
to wear so I'm definitely keeping that
you definitely keeping their sunglasses
what do we have here this is just a
plain black hat I remember buying in
Chicago because it was freezing and I
didn't have one but I'm gonna pass it on
oh these are Mickey gloves
they have little Mickey's on them I
bought them in Disney because it was
actually that cold the day I bought them
so I'm definitely keeping those I think
these are just fun very like Downton
Abbey II with the little buttons and
these I just don't wear enough they're
fun but well let me rephrase I haven't
worn them at all I think I got him in a
fabfitfun so I'm gonna pass them on but
I am going to you know what I never wear
these they're cute I don't wear them
they're gonna go okay so now I need oh
this is the bag for that Lotus bag
perfect so I can put that in this dust
bag and then out of these scarves I
think I'm gonna get rid of this one keep
that one so back to what I originally
wanted to do in the first place so this
is everything I'm getting rid of isn't
that insane how do I have that much
stuff to get rid of this is everything
I'm keeping I mean it's also a mess but
I'm excited to organize it back in there
and once I have it organized in there
I'll show you what it looks like okay
upon further investigation I'm gonna get
rid of both of these I'm just gonna keep
the target ones and then these other
ones I just I haven't worn them in so
long it's I don't need to keep them okay
you're gonna be proud of me I ended up
getting rid of even more so I was
putting the shoes back in and I'm
looking at I'm like you know what no
anything that I was on the fence about
is going so like these shoes they're
gone these shoes they're gone these
they're gone I had things that I was
like I don't know if they fit well I
haven't been trying to wear them yet so
why am i keeping them those these are
just old these don't fit right these
don't fit right these are old so I am
very from my pile is getting bigger and
let me show you my shoes so simplified
let's count how many pairs so I just
counted there's 22 and a pair of
slippers that includes boots and tennis
shoes and flats and heels and sandals my
pair of slippers like I said so I feel
very
he's like I've never had this is gonna
sound insane I've never had this few
shoes it's such a good feeling because I
feel like I actually know what I have
like so many things hittin so many
things I'm keeping just in case like it
just doesn't matter and this feels so
much better that organizer was kind of
falling apart so it's nice to not have
it now like I said we're eventually
redoing this closet I have my
accessories up here and I also had these
two hats that I love I'm not getting rid
of so they're still there too but that
isn't awesome awesome feeling oh and my
purses I just hang on a little hook here
so I had my longshot one the one I'm
wearing and then I forgot about this one
from the brand ever Lane
I love I've had that for a while so
definitely keeping that as well and now
I am out of breath that's embarrassing

think that's all for this video if you
