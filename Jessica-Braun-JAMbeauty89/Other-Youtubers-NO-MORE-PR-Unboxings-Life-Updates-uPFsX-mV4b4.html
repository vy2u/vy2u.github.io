I'm sure that's how everyone starts
their live feed I think I'm starting it
that way every time hey I hope my mom
but hi guys I feel like it's been a very
long time since I've gotten to just
straight-up chat with you guys hold on I
got to hear myself talk that was so
annoying
holy moly oh okay so now I see you guys
hi guys oh my gosh
you guys make my heart so happy you have
to know and I wonder if every youtuber
in the world no matter what your
subscriber count is I feel like any time
I've ever done a live thing I'm like
what if no one watches and you guys are
just making my heart pound there's so
many of you guys hi guys thanks to
thanks for the glasses complements so I
don't even have anything to say I just
wanted to talk to you guys I feel like
it's been quite a whirlwind this summer
school ended and we like left town
really quickly after that for a couple
of weeks and if you've seen my recent
travel videos I filmed those a couple of
weeks ago before we moved and before we
traveled while we're back we've been
back like a month and I finally got
around to editing them and getting them
up stuff like that but um we moved into
a new house our very first house ever
either one of us and together so it's
also exciting and we have so much more
space so I have a whole room to be able
to film videos in so now like the
biggest problem in the apartment was he
and I shared an office so when I would
need to film I'd have to get all of my
equipment out from the closet set it up
so I would only film on the weekends now
I can film a little bit more often
because I can leave the equipment up and
ready so I can just flip on the camera
flip on the microphone and lights and
film so that is huge to me and I'm just
I'm so excited to be able to spend more
time doing this because I love it
alright so I'm only on screen with your
name on some people aren't struggling to
figure it out hopefully you guys are
able to see it
um okay I'm like overwhelmed I want to
get serious questions okay so thank you
guys are so sweet about the new house
looking for questions what questions you
guys have a lot of fellow teachers out
there hi other teachers so the house is
coming along chill banana asked how the
house is coming along very well we're
still I mean we're moving from an
apartment to a house and anyone that's
ever done that there's just more space
to fill typically and we don't have that
much furniture so it's been a slow
process like finding things we want and
hey you're like I just was like I
wish the whole house was done and it
looked amazing but there's also that
part of the process where well I don't
have enough money to buy an entire house
of furniture and you know there's no
rush there really isn't cuz this is the
fun part of moving in it's the fun part
is the furnishing it and the decorating
it and all that fun times you go to the
store to find things to buy for your
house together and so I'm trying to just
kind of embrace that time and enjoy it
but I'm like very impatient so that side
of me is like I just want it to be done
but we had originally lived in a place
called this year's Indiana and I'm sure
anyone from central Indiana knows where
that is and we moved to Carmel Indiana
to be closer where I teach so I'm very
excited I love this town it's it's very
friendly town very clean
I just love it I love it level oh all
right how did I start my youtube channel
well I was living with my parents and I
was like gonna start student teaching
and I bought an on Amazon like a little
tripod for five dollars that would hold
my iPhone and I sat on my floor in front
of a window and that is how I started it
and also side note I didn't realize that
like youtubers would go back and delete
their old videos like therefore why
would anyone do that is that a thing I
someone I don't remember how I found out
but like it was one of those videos of
like a youtuber reacting to their first
video I remember which one and I read a
lot of comments and people were like oh
you know so many people delete their
first ones and then I started looking
for some peoples in like what like why
why would you delete that that's like a
fun part of your history as a youtuber
being able to see that and I don't know
that like made me sad am i why would you
not be proud of where you started and
how far you've come there's nothing
embarrassing about where you started
that if anything should be inspiring to
yourself to others that watch you to
younger people that are wanting to start
it but they think that to start a
YouTube channel you have to have
thousands of dollars worth of equipment
no you do not you need a window maybe a
phone that's about it I mean you don't
it doesn't have to be unbelievable
quality when you start it shouldn't be
because I think you miss some of that
learning curve and that appreciation you
just wouldn't have it if you started
from the top does that make sense now
I'm just thinking that started from the
bottom now it's okay anyway
I teach fifth grade and this is the very
first year this will be my fourth year
teaching this is the very first year
that I'm staying in the same classroom
in the same school teaching the same
grade I am so excited
I love the school I work for I love the
people I work with we just got a new
principal and I've met her and she's
lovely I loved our old principal though
I'm biased because she's the one who
hired me so I mean but she the new one
is so lovely and I'm just so excited so
it's gonna be an awesome year I'm kind
of nervous because I'm if you're a
teacher I'm at that point where I need
to decorate my room like officially for
the year and I haven't gone in to do
that and I'm like postponing it and
procrastinating I'm like okay I need to
like actually go in and do it but I'm
just like but once I start doing that
that means a school yard about to start
and summers whole stuff over and I don't
want to accept that mentally um OH Ohio
half of my family's from Ohio my dad was
born in Parma or Cleveland you know and
like most of my older siblings were also
Buckeyes born in Ohio
um
actually I think I was the first one me
and my younger brother but the first
ones born in Indiana organization videos
new house yes I actually filmed today a
really impromptu like behind the scenes
look at the equipment I use because I
was talking about expensive equipment
most of the equipment I have is very
very inexpensive truly the lights are
inexpensive the microphone I use is
really in and I mean like twenty to
thirty dollars not expensive at all when
you think about what you're using now
the camera was more expensive but for
the longest time I didn't have this
camera I really saved up for it I did
use my phone for the first like year and
a half two years um anyway so that will
be coming up soon it's really I mean
it's informal for sure but just so you
guys could see what I use how I set it
up in this room stuff like that
for editing I used moviemaker on my
Windows laptop that I had for a long
time I finally got a Mac again I saved
up for it for a long time and finally
got a Mac it's still the same one I use
it's getting although it's slower down
and so then I started using iMovie I
still use iMovie I know a lot of people
use what is what's the famous one that's
like really expensive through Apple oh
my gosh not QuickTime guys what does it
call I'm gonna go not somebody say what
is it Tyler
he can't hear he has headphones in cuz
I'm talking too loudly anyway well
whatever that is called someone's gonna
say it and I'm gonna be upset Final Cut
Pro thank you yes you guys are all
killing it now it's finally popping up
yes Final Cut Pro that's super expensive
and I have a bit the bullet yet cuz I'm
like you know what everything I'm doing
with my channel I've been able to do on
iMovie and iMovie was it is it free or
did we buy it once I don't know if way
cheaper than Final Cut Pro also I think
it's just included either way um so I
might one day bite the bullet but I
don't know because I would like need to
have a very specific thing I want to do
that I haven't been able to do on iMovie
to want to spend that money I don't want
to use it just because everyone else is
using it if I really don't feel like I'm
missing out on anything
yes iMovie is free thank you guys you
guys are amazing anyway so don't feel
like you have to spend a million dollars
you just don't you just don't or if you
have the money and you just don't want
to spend it then no you have to UM the
Kara uses the Canon
t5i now I'm seeing in front and we have
a bunch of lenses for it I just used the
lens that came in the kit because it
does again it does exactly what I needed
to do and nothing more nothing less
but I have to admit I'm looking into
other cameras and actually the cameras
I'm looking at are cheaper than this one
because I don't think it's got the
quality that I really want it to have
and you know I've done so many different
things with settings I've had so much
trouble with the settings on the camera
and I've watched so many tutorials I've
read the book I mean my husband has two
and we still it's I don't know it's just
not what I always envisioned I bought it
because that's what everyone else was
using and I don't know I think it's a
lot of money for what it does I think
you can do the same thing for cheaper if
I find a camera that actually does a
better job for cheaper I will certainly
let you know because that's what I'm on
the hunt for um how old am I am 28 and
what makes me sad and laugh and sad is
that sometimes also be like am 28 people
how you looked over in that but nowadays
it's more like I would be like I'm 28
and they're like really it's like nope
just 28 like thanks for telling me you
could have kept that one in your head
not told me me like I'm look older than
I actually am what can you do about it I
was just talking I was filming my July
favorites a little early I feel bad cuz
I didn't do a June favorites and those
talking about fine lines and I'm like
you know it's kind of hereditary like my
dad has really pronounced you know
wrinkles and fine lines and he really
has had those fine lines since he was
younger so right I just think it's red
it's hairy I do like everything skincare
wise you could possibly do but I don't
mind it I feel like it I smile a lot and
it is what it is it's alright it's okay
that you guys think I look 41 I'm only
28 Oh see thank you some of you guys
like no you look younger
thank you not everyone agrees with you
Thanks alright you guys are so sweet
happy 29th birthday blimey Hermione oh
seven by the way I'm reading Harry
Potter through again I mean I've read
Harry Potter before I'm reading it all
the way through and I'm on the
look and I've been using audible no this
isn't sponsored but I thought it would
sound funny if I said that but I really
am but I'm not sponsored I really am
listening to Harry Potter on audible but
we bought the whole series Tyler I did
because he listens anyway it took me a
while to hop on board cuz I'm like I
don't get how you could like listen to
it and actually understand it but the
guy that reads the Harry Potter books
Jim Dale is his name he's unbelievable
he does the voices so well anyway but
I'm also reading it like on my Kindle
and so freaking good and I don't want to
spoil a book if you've never read it but
if you like the series like the movies
and you haven't read the books you have
got to read the books because they you
are just like transformed you feel like
you're actually there and like when the
book series ended it's like the saddest
thing you're like no and that's why I'm
so excited like with all the new Harry
Potter that kind of spin-off things I'm
so excited that that world will just
keep going on because it's like a part
of my life and it's a part of Tyler's
life too and more nerdy and I don't care
and I just got my little niece who's
like going in the sixth grade she's just
starting to read it and she's borrowing
our books I'm like whole she has no idea
she's never seen the movies read the
books she's like gonna start this world
and just lose her mind cuz it's so
amazing ok I'll shut up about her Harry
Potter that's awesome
Barham Kenton said that Jim Dale was won
Grammys for his narrations that is
un-freakin'-believable good for him
anyway yes I still teach and that's a
lot I saw some questions just about what
am I talking about sorry I'm like losing
my train of thought course I am this is
me every day it's a teacher way students
have to like help me bike this is Brian
you were talking about it I'm like okay
thank you alright look what they just
saying no for real oh about quitting
teaching I feel like every year I get
that point where I'm like maybe I'll
quit teaching and just do YouTube and I
always keep going because I just love
teaching I just do and I can't explain
it it's so much work way more than what
you get paid period no matter where you
teach but it's like one of those things
that you know I wake up everyone
earlene oh my go to work but then I get
there and I'll like everyone smile have
these moments right look around and I'm
like oh my gosh like I love this I love
the kids I love what I do
fifth grade is so fun to teach because
you can teach them like juicy history
and I love that but then they you can
also read amazing books with them and
they do amazing writing like poetry I
love reading the foot let all that stuff
I just love and so I figure until the
day comes that I'm just not enjoying it
anymore maybe that would be the time to
quit but until I hit that point I'm like
why quit you know I don't know and there
are so many youtubers that have smaller
subscriber counts than me so I know
they're making less money than me most
likely on YouTube that are quitting
their jobs because you can't if I wanted
to I could quit and be just fine
financially I'm just being honest with
you guys but I don't want to I like
teaching so I guess what I'm saying is
I've gotten to the point where I like my
job not just for the money but because
of the job and I like YouTube not
because of any money but because of the
job and I think because of that I'm
hoping that that keeps me level-headed
when it comes to this whole makeup world
because I think people that only do this
not all of them because I some of them
are my friends and they only do YouTube
and they're totally normal it's not
everyone but I think that there are some
youtubers and I know some of you guys
are probably watching and going because
there are some youtubers that just this
is their world and they don't I think
they've just forgotten what it's like to
be normal and to have a job and to get
up early for that job and to Ferb I
think they don't they've anything for me
I think I've sometimes forgotten what
it's like to have just a makeup bag of
makeup and that's it and to some of you
guys that might sound absolutely insane
like what do you mean but I think a lot
of you guys will understand what I mean
you start collecting makeup and it's
like this black hole to wear now you
know I've been doing this for quite a
few years I don't remember what it's
like I have a very vague memories of
just having a bag of makeup and that's
it and I'm so intrigued and this is like
sad and weird but I'm intrigued by Peep
that just have a makeup back and I'm
always like what do you use like I'm
more interested in what they're using
because I'm like what do people that
just go to the drugstore with no idea of
this whole YouTube world and reviews
what do people just buy naturally you
know do they just keep buying the thing
that they bought for years like my mom
has been buying the same mascara forever
and I keep telling my mom like mom it's
not commenced ever but she just loves it
there and you know there's nothing wrong
with that but it's so funny I've tried
too annoying like this mascara is
terrible but anyway yeah I don't even
know where I started and what I'm
talking about anymore but anyway um but
I hope you guys know what I mean by like
I don't mean that as any shade or tea or
anything against any other youtubers
because a lot of them I mean I watch
Muslim this is a world that I'm a part
of and I love being a part of this world
and I love you guys and you guys are a
part of this world but I do think that
there's something to be said about
remembering what being normal is like
and that having all this makeup is not
necessarily normal and I know a lot of
you guys have a lot of makeup too so you
get what I'm saying I feel like I'm over
explaining um my mom uses the I'm gonna
offend some of you guys because some of
you guys might use this mascara but it's
a blue it's called by its cover girl and
it's a CG professional mascara and it's
in a blue tube and I've tried it like a
million times and every time it just
gets everywhere and I'll even see him
like mom you've even got some smudges
down there and she's a cold and I feel
like given hurts so many mascaras and
she'll use it would be like hmm and then
go back to the other one I think it's
just that comfort of you know she's used
it for decades there's you know there's
nothing wrong with that it's just so
funny to me
anyway um have I ever called 9-1-1 what
an interesting question I don't think
that I have I think I'm lucky in that I
don't think not you know intentionally
no I've never called nine one I will say
though I'm trained in CPR you know to be
a teacher at least in our state you have
to be and you have to renew it and I
just renewed my license this last year
so I'm gonna have to renew it again in a
year anyway
but even during the thing I'm like what
will I do like if I ever genuinely had
to give CPR I feel like I freaked out
not remember anything you know what I
mean it's good that you have to retrain
but I'm like at what point do you just
remember it forever because I'm like I
feel like I like a month later I'm like
I already forget it wait how many you
know like those things I don't know it
just freaks me out now I want to look up
a youtube video and make sure I still
remember because that freaks me out um
anyway fellow youtubers i watch oh
keyword don't let me forget you guys to
talk about my PR unboxing videos I don't
want to forget to talk about that so
just like in three minutes if I haven't
talked about pop it into the comments
alright so other youtubers i watch I
love Emily Noelle um she's like the
first person I always think of but I
cheat because I think I'm just inspired
a lot by her she's just incredibly
intelligent I like listening to her talk
those are two huge things for me if I
don't feel this sounds so mean but if I
feel like I don't know like I don't want
to say that I'm smarter than them that's
not at all what I mean but if I feel
like you're not as well-versed in what
you're talking about I'm just like hmm
now there are plenty of things I talk
about that I don't know a lot about so
it's not a blanket statement but anyway
she's just super intelligent I like
watching her um I love Jen loves reviews
I can't plug her enough because she does
this Sunday news show called what's up
and makeup and she has all these people
that contribute and they talk about
indie brands drugstore brands high-end
brands everything you could ever
freaking imagine they talk about every
week and she gives basically what's new
out there what sales are on this week
and it's every single week without fail
unless she's you know taking a break
what she should from time to time
because it's a lot of work for her and
the people that contribute but it's
amazing and every time I look at her
subscriber count I'm like what how does
she not have she deserves way more
subscribers than I have she does so much
work she's amazing and she used to be a
teacher which I also think is awesome so
it's Jen loves reviews look her up loves
is like Lu vs she's amazing and you will
thank me because the news thing like
that is where I get my makeup news I
watch it every Sunday she's amazing
Kathleen mics yes I just
I absolutely watch Kathleen I have to
admit I'm gonna be very very very real
with you this is horrible should I even
tell you guys I feel like I shouldn't
every once in a while I feel like I
shouldn't tell you guys this I'm being
very honest like you guys are my BFFs
and I'm telling you because I've grown
up since then but every once in a while
certain youtubers will get so big and it
will make me jealous it's an honest
human emotion jealousy and so like I
would like for a while like
kathleenlights so many of you guys said
I look like her which I'm like I see
bits but I really don't think we look
like people like oh my gosh I can't tell
you apart like really and I've got a
mistaken and events for her Mike really
is a huge compliment she is freaking
gorgeous I wouldn't love to look but
it's just so funny how some of you guys
see it in some of the guys don't but I
would get so jealous that she's so
successful and so freakin beautiful that
sometimes I will go months and just not
watch her videos and then I'm like trust
that you're being an idiot you love
watching her she makes you laugh she's
beautiful she knows what she's talking
about so then I watch her and then be
like oh yeah I remember I love her and
then I looks like a million videos so
and then she's not the only one but like
it's just jealousy like it's just honest
it's just the truth
and now I feel awkward for telling you
that oh well it's already been said Oh
Rachel uh I do watch Rachel uh she's so
fun she's one of those though I have to
like have the energy to watch her
because she's so energetic that like if
it's morning
I can't always watch her because she's
so like Laura Lee - I've got to be in
the right mindset to watch her because
she is a lot of high energy and if
you've watched her you know I mean she's
just really high energy um Jamie Paige I
love she I foresee her channel growing
so fast that she'll be like at a million
in like a year and she's she's one of
those youtubers that goes to a ton of
events like every time I see her
snapchat I'm like oh my gosh she's
always at events I've in my entire
YouTube career been invited to plenty
only gone - to - because I'm like I
don't know like I love this world but I
don't have time like I have a real job I
can't just get on flights all that's
and be all over I just can't I just
can't so I've gone to two one in LA one
in New York and that is that I'm sure I
will go to some others in the future I
would love to I just don't have time
Totti i watch I used to watch a lot a
lot a lot and I I loved Tati I met Tati
and she was lovely in person like so
down to earth so normal which she should
be I mean YouTube is a weird world
because it's not real Fame it's it is
but it's just different you know what I
mean you're going to the store if you're
Britney Spears everyone that store is
gonna WR but as a youtuber you go to the
store and well even if you're Tati
you're not being stopped every two
minutes I mean yeah a lot of people are
gonna recognize her but not at the same
rate as like someone famous on TV TV
that's I'm normal anyway but yeah I
don't know I I I hope that she's not
losing sight of I don't know how to say
this knots on me because I love Topsy
and I haven't I don't think I've missed
a single video first like ever even
still today I watch her all the time
I do years Nona and saying though like
she still does drugstore but I I think
it's not that she's losing sight of
drugstore roots that's not what it is I
hope that she isn't losing sight of like
normalcy groups I think there's a lot of
youtubers that are losing touch with
being a normal human being and talking
like a normal human being and not her
really but I don't know how to describe
it can M you guys put this in to the
proper wording I'm not trying to sound
mean because I I loved Tati and I watch
her every day but you you guys know what
I mean coffee break with Danny I love
her she's one of those people I put on
and she just puts me in an awesome mood
because she is she talks you like you're
right there and I think maybe that's
what it is I appreciate when I don't
feel like I'm being talked down to and
sometimes I feel like other youtubers I
feel like I'm being talked down to or
that they don't have the time for us or
that you know what I'm like like I don't
know and so I love Danny
oh my gosh if you don't watch coffee
break with Danny oh my gosh she's so
good and so normal and she'll say things
and I'm like I would never say that
but it's like she's just being honest
and it's not like offensive that's not
what I mean but just like she'll say
things that I'm like I don't think I
would ever say that on my channel but I
love that she just said that because
it's so true about whatever and so she
inspires me a lot to just you know
continue to be a normal human being that
you feel like you're talking with your
girlfriend's I feel like I'm talking to
people I know even though I don't know
every single one of you but I feel like
I do and I hope that if you ever saw me
in person you would feel that same way
because I'm no different whether I'm
teaching talking to a parent of a
student or talking to you guys or you
know it I don't really change I don't I
don't think I do anyway all right there
are so many other ones
Casey Holmes I don't really watch her
it's nothing against her she's just not
really my style of um I don't know I
don't have anything against her I've
watched I've subscribed to her or not
everyone saw see a video that like
catches my fancy but I I guess she's not
really like my style of videos and I
think I'm starting to kind of hone down
on what I actually enjoy and I used to
watch videos just for the sake of like I
don't know like I would watch them just
because I'm like well I better watch
Jacqueline Hills latest video cuz
everyone will be talking about and I
better watch so-and-so's news but but I
kind of realize like you know what if I
don't really enjoy their videos and like
if I'm watching a video of a youtuber I
love I just sit there and I watch it you
know I'm just like booty clutter but
like it and sometimes I just watch I
used to watch videos just because I
wanted to know you know I did fear of
missing out it's basically that like I
didn't want to miss some thing that
jaclyn hill said or some product that so
until up when in reality I'm like I'm
not really enjoying this anymore so I
finally what's up Cathy third Nick I see
a girlfriend I love her too anyway so I
just feel like I'm just starting to weed
out those that I don't really mesh as
well with that I feel like if I met in
person I'd be like hey
we wouldn't actually get along well I
don't really wanna watch their video no
no anyway i'm florida forest i just
don't watch a lot of hers not really i
think i would really like her i just
need to watch more of her um Andreea
mightily ah no I love so much her videos
are just like pretty like I just like
they're pretty if you know what I mean
like they're just like gorgeous videos
um okay PR thank you guys Oh young wild
and polish Nicole yes I still watch her
she cracks me up and I love her okay
what am i okay P are you guys thank you
you see I need you guys to follow me
around and remind me to talk about
things like that all right
gosh you guys are naming youtubers that
oh I love 11 gorgeous but a bunch of
youtubers I've never watched
Lois Lane I met at an elf event and it
was interesting I will say this when I
watched her I didn't know who she was
so when I I think like that night in the
hotel room I pulled up her channel and I
was watching some of it I'm like oh my
gosh like I love her videos she seems so
incredibly sweet she does if you've ever
seen her videos she seems so sweet but
her personality during that weekend with
elf in New York was very different than
their videos and it was odd because I
feel like usually it's the other way
around I'm like maybe you'd come across
a certain way to videos but impersonal
oh my gosh they're actually really sweet
and she it wasn't that she was mean or
anything but it was just very different
that's all I'll say cuz again I'm not
saying anything mean about her because
she was really she was nothing but nice
to me but it was just she was different
than in her videos that's that's all
sick all right Jessica come on PR so I
have decided to stop filming PR
unboxings and I'm sure a lot of you guys
are like thank you and then some of you
guys are like no but I feel like
I don't know like I've watched some
other people's PR unboxings and I kind
of realized that like I started to feel
that same jealousy I'm like ah like I
didn't get sent that or oh my gosh I'm
so jealous that they have the whole line
you know and I thought what am i doing
like if I'm feeling this way where it
kind of rubs me the wrong way it has to
be rubbing you guys the wrong way and
the reason I wanted to do them in the
first place was because I thought that's
a great idea a great way for me to tell
you guys about new products that are out
there but I worried every time I filmed
them I would worry that they were coming
across like either braggy
or that you know oh wow another thing
cool or like ungrateful or you know what
I mean so the second I started to
realize how I was feeling watching them
as a fellow youtuber I thought holy
moley if I weren't a youtuber and not
receiving this and I was watching it it
would rub me even more the wrong way so
I hope it never came across that way
when I was doing them but I just kind of
I kind of made the decision for myself
like you know what it's not it's not
worth rubbing you guys that way because
I don't need to do them you know what I
mean no company is expecting me to do
them and if they are well they're
sending it for the wrong reasons I mean
whatever they can send it for whatever
reason they think but the reality is I
get sent stuff like that all the time
and half of it I don't mention because
either it was just men or it ends up
being terrible and I do mention it in
like a favorites and fails video you
know so by-and-by I end up talking about
different products through that manner
but I don't know I just felt like it was
not serving the purpose I wanted it to
and so I don't blame you if you don't
like PR videos because I've kind of now
joined that camp and you know so if you
feel like you enjoyed them I'm sorry
that I'm cutting that off but I know
that I think it was more overwhelmingly
you know you might have watched them
just because you were curious but it
still kind of gave you that feeling and
I understand that feeling
so anyway oh okay so subscription boxes
I don't really get subscription boxes
anymore
I'm fabfitfun they just send me so
sometimes I'll show the unboxing I don't
always
but I do want to subscribe to the play
by Sephora and the new Macy's beauty box
because I saw Andre Amati Leone oh do an
unboxing like oh my gosh I didn't know
that existed so I think I'm just gonna
straight-up subscribe to both pay for
ball you know I I kind of got spoiled
and that they were like sending the Ipsy
and sending boxycharm and um I don't
know I just kind of cancel him I don't
get him anymore I just told them you
know hey you don't have to send them to
me anymore
I think boxycharm is still sending it to
me but I kind of stopped because a lot
of you guys I felt like you guys weren't
watching them as much I know some people
did and I thought you know why am I
wasting I could be wasting this energy
on other videos that you guys would love
so I might still unbox boxycharm but I
want to give some love to some new ones
so you guys can know about them because
that's my job is to tell you guys about
what's out there so I'm gonna try to
subscribe to the play by Sephora and
this new Macy's beauty box cuz it's like
high-end brands in the Macy's Beauty box
because it's Macy's I'm like that's
genius but I think it's like twenty
dollars I'm like oh but I mean so was
boxy trim so I guess it's not that crazy
but still alright what else what else
stitch fixed that's one that I just
scheduled whenever I want so like I know
I did one video with them but I still
pay for those like with my own money
they just sponsored the giveaway portion
which was so much fun
but um I just love stitch backs so I'll
probably I mean I just do that like it's
coming up back-to-school I'll just end
up like scheduling a delivery you kind
of do it whenever you want which is
really cool so I probably will do
another one of those just cuz I enjoy it
and I'm gonna do it anyway I figure
might as well show you but um trunk club
yeah there's a bunch of those clothing
ones I want to look into I know I need
to like broaden my horizons um oh okay
so banana cream pie hmm just that Macy's
is $15 but it comes with a $5 gift card
so ah I see so in the end okay I got you
um vlog miss y'all probably do vlogmas
be our first Christmas in this new house
wanna be so excited I gotta like I am
truly like sweating I got all these
lights on I got this shirt from Goodwill
I bought like ten new shirts at Goodwill
and I feel like this was like Ann Taylor
Loft or something like that I was like
it wasn't the half off day though I got
to go first Saturday of every month
anyway um house tour um I don't know my
sister's sister-in-law I don't know what
I would call her but she is a police
officer and she was telling me back a
couple years ago she had seen a bunch of
comments of people saying you know
please do an apartment tour at that time
you know and she'd kind of warned me
she's like you know from a security
standpoint as a police officer I really
don't recommend you do that I thought
about like you know what she's kind of
right because that's a surefire way if
anyone ever figured out where I lived
and they had bad intentions not that any
of you guys do but I do know other
youtubers that have had their house
working in - and a lot of their makeup
stolen and other stuff I'm like I don't
know if it's worth it so you might see a
lot of glimpses of my house in vlogs but
beyond that I don't know that I'm gonna
do an official house tour so if you are
curious my husband's channel that's
where we do our vlogs typically other
than vlogmas i do on my channel but
that's where we put all of our travel
vlogs and just any random vlogs we do
they're all on his channel and it's
Tyler travels TV so if you ever want to
see our lives outside of just YouTube
that would be a great way to see it he's
actually currently like editing all of
our vlogs from our two-week trip to
Spain and Ireland and that will be up
soon it's a bunch of videos so if you
want to see all that that was so much I
can't wait to see those vlogs just to
relive it but that's where all those go
if you've ever been curious um-um um-um
um-um Beauty room tour though yes I will
do a new like makeup collection tour and
stuff like that very very soon hi Alison
Wilson she said please notice me have I
ever had any scarier creepy YouTube
encounters know that I have not luckily
glad that I have not I mean that would
be horrible and I'm sure many people
have but I think I'm kind of lucky where
I live too you know in Indiana there's
it's not a huge like YouTube presents
kind of a place so kind of nice um yes
yes yes I'm sorry I'm reading put the
vlog address in description box good
idea oh I do have it on there if you see
like in my description box I'm looking
at it right now it says my husband
Tyler's channel slash our vlog so um
it's in there so if you were curious
know check it out um well I think I just
lost where I was though I want to be
able to read your comments and now is
anyone else sweating no you guys aren't
in the room with me what else should we
talk about ladies and gents Oh quiet
Jess you're talking over me papi
Pinocchio is sleeping in the other room
with Tyler
um Korean makeup I have tried quite a
bit of it just randomly it'll get set
it's always like way better than what we
have in America that's the thing that
kills me p.o box unboxings I kind of
been putting that in the same like PR
unboxing thing like I used to do like a
lot of you guys would say you send me
like letters and mail and it's so lovely
but I started to worry that you guys
were sending me things just to get shown
on screens not that you guys would but I
don't know and I felt like the
intentions weren't always there and then
it started to get really overwhelming
and I felt so bad and I wasn't even able
to like write enough thank-you cards for
all of it I know that upsets me guys so
I was like you know what this is - I
just got to stop so I stopped that a
couple of years ago but I I was so
appreciative you guys were so amazing
but i i i just felt like it was kind of
getting out of hand and so that was why
i just decided to stop it um hi katie
rose oh you're going to school for
theater studies that's so cool um you're
gonna double major holy moly with
teacher education well then you could
teach theater maybe in like high school
any advice for a new theater student um
just
number that when you graduate all the
cutthroat that was what I hated about
going to school for theater and musical
theater was I felt like you would think
so much your friend and then like I
don't know like everything was so cut
through which was so dumb because in the
real world yes you might be up against
some of those same people for a show but
when you're talking about shows in your
small realm of that College everything
was cutthroat and catty and I'm like I
can't hit like I don't I didn't like it
I just didn't like it and I was becoming
a person that I didn't like I was I was
like not a good friend to some of my
friends and I made horrible decisions
and I was like you know what this isn't
me
it's not who I was raised to be and so
when I finally decided to leave after
like two and a half years and I moved
back home I had never felt so relieved
because I had become this person that I
wasn't proud of and I did things I
wasn't proud of and I ruined friendships
that I really regret people that were
really good people so it was just kind
of a mess and I wasn't happy with who I
was so I was really glad to get out of
that so whatever you do stay true to
yourself don't let any of the theater
mess and this is true for any College
anything because the reality is you'll
leave college and you might be friends
with some of them you might be friends
with none of them it's a small blip in
your life and it can be an amazing time
but it's just that it's a small part of
your life and not everything revolves
around that people move on not
everything is life or death so just do
your best remember that it's real money
that you're spending on it just because
it's alone doesn't mean that loan it's
just gonna go away because I'm currently
paying back a ton of student loans and
it sucks and if I had really thought
about what I was doing I would have
picked a way cheaper College because you
know you're 18 pulling out loans I was
my parents couldn't afford to pay for it
they paid a lot of it you know like the
monthly parts they pulled out some loans
I pull out loans and it's so much money
and it's real money and you don't
realize it when you're 18 19 20 how real
that money is but it's real and you
really have to pay it back and I don't
know it's hard to explain until you're
facing it but anyone that has
like that you understand so I went to
college at a place called Roosevelt
University
it was the Chicago College of Performing
Arts and that's where I studied musical
theater etc it was so much fun it was a
lot of fun but I am hi Sarah Kate but I
am ended up leaving like I said and then
i went to iu p UI which is indiana
university-purdue University
Indianapolis and I studied teaching
elementary education and I got my
license to teach I had to do a full four
years cuz none of my credits transferred
that was fun so it took me like six and
a half years to graduate was teaching
URI because of my anyway um so anyway
yes hi anyone from Chicago I love
Chicago I have not been to Holland Kim
I would love to that's like on my list
of places to UM rakaia that's a pretty
name I hope I'm saying it right for kaya
Stone asks how I feel about colourpop's
knew millions of products they keep
launching all the time I do think that's
kind of funny like okay brands plug in
they're not the only brand but they
launched like ten thousand new products
like okay like slow dick but no one can
keep up it's too much and unless you're
like absolutely colour-pop obsessed or
you're on their mailing list where they
send you a list there's no way to keep
up with it and I don't know I color pop
eyeshadows are great I mean I feel like
I had a bunch at one time and I got rid
of a bunch because I just wasn't using
them but they are really cool um but it
is very interesting very very
interesting okay mm-hmm favorite thing
about Ireland oh my gosh my favorite
thing was going to Hills just any old
Hill in the countryside and standing on
it and just that was my favorite thing I
told Tyler and my friends that we were
with that all I wanted to do in Ireland
with Stan on green hills and just
breathe in clean air and it was amazing
and any time we would get to a hill I
would do it and in the weirdest way that
was the most memorable thing it just was
weird huh um anyway so
hmm lots of questions about kids we're
not having a kid right now I'll tell you
that but I will say that moving into a
house was one thing that we wanted to do
before we'd ever do that
so that is checked off you'll see but I
will say a lot of our neighbors thought
I was already pregnant I was like no I
don't think I'm looking but anyway I was
like our neighbor - I was helping to
move something really heavy out of a um
like a truck that we were borrowing and
the neighbor ran over this guy and he
was like whoa whoa whoa do you need help
moving this and he was like you
shouldn't be doing that I'm like okay
I'm like well I mean it is pretty heavy
and it was I'd much rather him move so
he comes and helps and he said well
you're expecting right I'm like no and
he's like oh well the lady who bought
the house from thought you were and I'm
like oh my gosh like it's just so so he
said well that's the rumor in the
neighborhood is that you're expecting
like well I'm not so we can go ahead and
squat to that rumor you just thought
that was really funny it's like well I
hope I don't look it was pretty funny
yes Christina why they're an obsessed
with when you have kids I think people
just I get it though like there are
other youtubers i watch like alright
they're really married like I wonder if
they're gonna have kids their kids are
going so cute like I don't think it's
ever from a bad place but it is so funny
how we all get obsessed with like other
people's lives like I am obsessed with
certain other youtubers and their lives
it's so weird and I can't explain it but
I feel like I know them and I feel like
I'm a part of their family it's like if
you watch The Office we just rewatched
the entire the office and we uh there is
a part where looks like constantly
Michael Scott always feels like he's a
part of Jim and Pam's life and like when
they first got pregnant he pulled them
into their office and he was like why
would you not have told me I can't
believe I found this out you know in
this way and Jim and Pam are like you're
right Michael
we should have remembered and known that
you are obviously the first person we
should have told it's like their boss
he's awesome anyway I could talk about
um okay so
yes I am so excited to see so many
things at Disney we're going to
Disneyland in September because my
brother is getting married in San Diego
and after the wedding and they're all
off on their own
we're gonna go Tyler and I to Disneyland
for a couple of days and we're gonna
stuff as much in as we can we got
reservations at the Blue Bayou and the
terrace I don't remember it's called but
it's like the terrace one and then one
other restaurant I'm just so excited to
try so many things yes I watched Parks
and Rec I loved it
um it's someone helping me monitor this
no does it seem like anyone else cuz I
am I'm like just scrolling through
comments um oh my gosh going to Disney
World a meal recommendation where should
she eat everywhere I love it all if you
can get a reservation and you can afford
it my favorite meal was seeing the
fireworks at Magic Kingdom be eating at
California grill because if you can eat
there during the day and then you can
come back at night they'll let you up if
you had a reservation that day and watch
it up on like the catwalk up on the
rooftop
it is amazing it's expensive but it's
worth saving up for it's amazing um I'm
getting hungry
I do watch Game of Thrones I want you
Game of Thrones and it's so good
and if you're younger you should not
watch it because there are parts that
I'm like oh like I shouldn't be watching
this
but it's the storyline is so good I just
bought the book and I want to read it
but I'm like I read like two pages to
mine okay I'm already overwhelmed like I
can't keep up with the names I can't
even keep up with the names just
watching it but anyway um so I think Oh
workout routine we bought a used
treadmill a week or two ago and it's in
our basement and I am so excited that's
the first time I've ever owned a
treadmill and I run I would run all the
time if they were convenient so having a
treadmill down there I'm like getting up
every morning and running I've already
lost like doing my arms look thinner I
easily gained like 10 pounds this summer
just like you know when you're moving
and you're I can't cook it so you're
eating lots of fast
and terrible stuff for you or just food
that's quick and then we were traveling
and eating horribly and drinking you
know Guinness which is really heavy and
all that stuff
ie they gave in ten pounds but I already
feel like in the past like week or so
I've lost like five pounds um I don't
think it's that drastic but you know
what I mean but in the summertime I
cannot run outside and I'm sure I'm not
alone when if it's 80 degrees out
there's no way I will run 1/4 of a mile
and feel like I'm dying and come inside
and say forget it I'm not running today
so having that inside in the basement
where it's cool I feel like I can
actually stay fit in the summer because
spring and fall are like my time to
shine I'm always in my best shape
because it feels amazing outside you can
run in the winter please staying fit in
the winter is like having a home freshly
baked chocolate chip cookie out of the
oven in your face and being able to say
no to it it's not gonna happen but
anyway so I'm really excited to have
that but I really don't have a routine
like there are certain things I do but I
learned them like in conditioning
classes when we were we had conditioning
for theater which I guess kind of makes
sense cuz like for dance and stuff you
know it's helpful to have a stronger
body anyway I learned a lot from that
though like what to do when you don't
have any equipment and you can't afford
it which was amazing and I kept a lot of
it with me and that's what I do but um
yeah so I could think about doing the
workout but I feel like there's so many
amazing workout routines and like my
best friend Sarah is literally a
physical trainer so maybe I'll like pull
her on and have her do a session on my
channel because she's amazing and I keep
telling her she needs to have her own
channel because she's amazing she lives
in Chicago and I never get to steal
anyway um I should end this though
because I'm getting to that point of
hunger where I'm like shake okay I'm
like doing that right now but like I'm
really hungry and I'm like feeling crazy
um so I might be a good girl and have a
salad but I also might be a bad girl and
eat like a maggots I don't know it could
go either way
um but I love you guys and thank you
guys so much for watching this was like
yeah I didn't this is my favorite thing
to do because I feel like I can just be
myself
I mean I'm myself in my videos but I try
not to get on too many tangents
because you know if I'm reviewing a
product I need to be talking about that
product that's why you're watching it
but this is where I just feel like I can
just just like spill out my mind and
you'd either enjoy it or you're like
shut up you're annoying and I don't feel
like there were too many trolls on this
though last time we did this they were
like weird amounts of people just saying
it's Amy the chicken nuggets why am I
still talking guy isn't posting all I
know she can have it sounds like soul
good
doesn't that dipped in like oh I just
got the goose bumps oh my gosh chicken
nuggets they're so good
I remember hearing the Lady gaga like
when she I don't know if this is true
when she would finish a show like when
she was like in her prime like crazy fit
but she would finish like a show and
that's I mean probably the most killer
workout of all time I can only imagine
she would have them have chicken nuggets
ready for her and she would eat chicken
nuggets after every show I thought that
was interesting my god checks out though
because she would burn off like
literally every calorie ever that she
ever consumes doing those shows anyway I
love you guys and I will talk to you
soon I just found a bunch of videos
today they will be up soon I also filmed
a lip declutter and I got rid of like a
ton of stuff here at the new place so I
could put that up and I didn't lose any
footage so if you saw my last stick
ladder and I lost like all the footage
to this time I did not live with any
footage that I know of anyway I love you
guys bye
how do I end this thing now here's the
awkward part where I don't know how to
end it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
