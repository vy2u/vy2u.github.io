husband it still sounds weird so this
video today is just gonna be all about
our wedding we've had a lot of people
ask both on my channel in on his so we
figured we would do a video all about
kind of the ways we kept it stress free
and low cost and just chill and there
were a lot of things we did very
intentionally just to make sure that you
know we didn't want our bridesmaids or
groomsmen to worry about spending a lot
of money on the dress and a tux and all
that stuff for something they'll never
wear again or you know all those little
things we kind of cut out one especially
I mean Chris bridesmaids usually buy the
dress and they never wear the dress
again bro groomsmen usually rent the tux
and then they have to give it right back
so it's like why even weight in the
money yeah yeah so well you did well as
far as buying these dresses everybody's
got to wear their own cuz it's our color
for black and white I guess we should
say that up front yeah so we just
everything easy peasy black and white
yeah and then you had just had your
bridesmaids wear a black dress whenever
one they wanted connects Fargo could not
I mean in the reality is I think a lot
of people as you're starting to get
married you know in the back of my mind
thinking well what if you know in
pictures won't look as uniform it
doesn't it doesn't matter man pictures
look amazing I did you look beautiful
and the thing is solid yeah black we're
both clearly excited about all your
bridesmaids then bought the dress they
wanted and then they can use that for
under time so you have they spent a
hundred and plus dollars check out right
but then they would have it for what
yeah and some of them even already had a
black dress so it worked out and then
for you the groomsmen they just all wore
black suits or the darkest suit they
have some people were like really really
dark maybe you couldn't really tell yeah
um white shirt black tie
it was so classy it was so quiet I mean
we'll put a pictures as we're talking
here yeah you can't even I mean you
would never know I mean everybody looks
so nice mm-hmm and it just worked out so
well so the one the pictures you might
have seen a few that we've already put
up our photographer was amazing
now I'm a little biased I'm biased
because I know I was I was in here
I'm not by tonight just letting the day
of the wedding and he was fantastic yeah
I was unbelievable but his name is
Michael and I've known him since
kindergarten and we used to like walk to
each other's house and like play as
kindergarten first grade but he grew up
of course and now he's all over the
world taking photos and so oh good it
just worked out so well and he had like
a second cam for us like kind of like we
didn't really know we were getting one
and he said hey we'll throw in a second
camera operator for some more candid
shots throughout the wedding and
reception we were like okay so as
Michael was taking like the you know the
posed pictures then the second one he
was just kind of going around taking
pictures of people guests just it was so
good his name is Chris he's awesome do
I've known him just about as long as
well it's it is so cool but they are
amazing in the reason I'm actually
bringing up the specific people we use
just because he's mobile so it's
possible that you guys could using so I
wanted to put his info down below
because he deserves all the credit all
the publicity I could possibly give him
because he was amazing and it made our
day so stress-free so I guess my advice
if you're not gonna go with him which he
totally good because he's so awesome but
if you are as you're looking for a
photographer that's where I would say it
is worth spending the money on someone
that you know is going to do exactly
what you want them to do because that's
scary if you leave that wedding is not
happening again and if you have no
photos that you like or you know
whatever you've got to make sure I mean
that's worth the money right there
that's the one thing I would say spend
more money on that nothing else yeah but
do your research I mean anybody's
getting married probably would but do
your research because there's so many
out there and a lot of them are not very
good so we are extremely lucky I mean
because not only did you know him
because a lot of people know
photographers like yeah where do your
wedding and then the pictures are
terrible yeah yeah he was way more
professional than anyone I got it and he
later in it yeah he was so relaxed and
he was good with people like telling
people where to go what to do you know
getting he was like 150 people organized
to do pictures
he was I think isn't evening during the
ceremony or during the reception he was
out dancing with everybody but still
taking pictures he ended up with
thousands of pictures that's up yeah
Saracens so I mean we gotta shut up
about it but we are clearly gushing
because it was probably the most
memorable part other than you know
actually getting married to you a lot of
you guys there's a lot of memorable
parts but you are right Vicky was great
so moving on yeah so we talked about
colors were black and white we did okay
here are some things we cut out yeah we
kind of um the we didn't have a flower
girl or ring bearer cuz it weren't
really necessary yeah and we have a
million nieces and nephews and to be
frank we really couldn't pick between
them so we're like just forget it that
saves money for the the parents of the
flower girl ring bearer so you not have
to buy them a little dress or a little
suit because they're gonna grow out of
it and then you're like so that's the
money there we cut all the flowers yeah
bridesmaids had no flowers they just
walk down nobody arm-in-arm with the
girls minute most of this stuff is it's
tradition but it's tradition because
somebody twenty-five thirty fifty
hundred years ago just decided to do it
so now it's a tradition when here it's
not necessary right and we save so much
money just cutting up those little
things that nobody in a million years
will ever even know we're gone right
like the aisle runner we didn't get a
gigantic piece of fabric as an aisle
runner we didn't decorate the actual
church really at all and we got two
things the flowers on the sides of the
altar and that was it and that's another
thing moving on to flowers we we were
actually we had bought some fake flowers
were just going to do some cheesy and we
did not cheesy cheap things like with
Dollar Tree flowers actually one of the
flower pieces right there you see in the
pink more my new mother-in-law but
Tyler's mom made for me
and we use this decoration it's a long
story it's beautiful so there's a lot
you can do with fake flowers and anyway
but we ended up I went to a flower shop
and I basically just said I want to
spend this amount of money and I need my
bouquet and I need to aisle pieces and I
want these colors what can you do for me
and they said oh no problem we'll be
able to do this and you know I kind of
picked the pots you know and then that
was it so when you go in with the price
in mind you
even if you got $100 and that's it for
flowers and you want two things and your
bouquet most flower shops will do it and
and in the end they want it to look good
so they end up probably adding one
exactly a good floor so put I mean you
know done double yeah they'll add
greenery they'll add small things that
are a little bit cheaper that still make
it look bigger and nicer and I mean
unless you're a florist you don't I mean
you don't really and I didn't even have
any idea of like the flowers at when I
just knew I was like just pastel colors
you know and that's that's what we
wanted that we got white for the altar
and it worked out great
um so the what else what we would handle
we got the candles for the unity candle
we got at the Dollar Tree and then we
decorated I think my sister did that one
our unity candle she decorated with like
a hair band I got at the Dollar Tree she
like wrapped around one beautiful yeah
decorations for the reception we did it
outside in his parents backyard that was
a catchy language save of money yeah
and welcome we should disclose yeah we
were lucky they're very very lucky
because my best friend makes wedding
dresses so he was able to make a custom
wedding dress for Jess that was amazing
it was amazing he's incredible Jessica's
brother is a caterer so he just charges
for food and then the people that worked
for him we had to pay czar their labor
you know there was two guys for 12 hours
each you know so we had to pay for that
but your brother worked for free yeah um
and then my brother's a DJ and he's an
amazing DJ as he was so good he's like a
90s our we should like his stuff alone
so yes totally by JK night I'm putting
on there thank you ladies our we're like
and most of the people there were like
all right so we all are like totally 90s
I grew up with night it was awesome it
was so good um and then we did the
reception in my parents backyard so we
but anybody can do that anybody if
somebody you might know somebody who
bakes case your cake does not have to
cost $2000 find somebody who you know
who's makes really good cakes or
cupcakes doesn't even have to be a labor
can yeah ours head two layers
yeah and then we just have to
and then cupcakes and we could have done
you like make sure only okay don't
matter
yeah if you can bake make your own
cupcakes I mean make them you know okay
me you might be a little stressed but if
your your mom's good at it you don't
have to go and spend money somewhere you
know you can find those people that are
in your life that are good at it that do
it maybe for a living or maybe they just
as a passion here boom you can see a lot
of money yeah so for the reception the
one thing that was pricey was running
tables and chairs and Ronan's so in the
end we realized instead of renting table
linens we discovered after looking on so
many sites that buying them in bulk was
I saved hundreds of dollars and hungry
owned them yeah so if we likely to sell
them or we you know we can keep a pair
on the family yeah I mean we saved money
and then we didn't have to just give
them back Spanish yeah we ended up with
an actual thing in our possession so
that was a really big realization so as
your price gauging check into buying
things on Amazon on eBay I've gone from
like an actual linen site you know linen
tablecloths calm or something like that
but um but beyond that the tables and
chairs were kind of expensive to rent
but just for what it is but once you
could beyond that if everything else is
kind of like my family pitched in and
helped decorate and stuff like we just
got some table scatter like little gems
and I receive those the dollar so I
ended up ordering my model in the Dollar
Tree yeah mirrors with like a we had um
fake candles cuz they were way too many
kids were like I'm not trying to start a
fire not one of it so we had fake little
flickering candles but they were so cute
yeah and we got these we went to Ikea
and we got these little lanterns so
while he's gone these are the lanterns
we got they were literally three
ninety-nine
IKEA and they're like real-deal it's got
a little door that opens but they were
perfect we had every other one with a
different one then I was talking about
getting fake flowers I bought a couple
little bunches of these flowers from the
Dollar Tree and then a ribbon that was
kind of my favorite black and white
ribbon I use for a lot for our wedding
reception and my sister just used some
green floral tape to the Dollar Tree
wrap them all together put some black
ribbon than this and that was it so this
is what I used at the rehearsal dinner
and then it was a decoration otherwise
but this could have been my bouquet
bouquet to just the same as that one
could have been I mean but you so much
you can you drew the one that was
absolutely flowers right because you
wanted to keep this one cuz it was cute
in the one we're gonna do this I days
which one you gonna keep now exactly and
then the other thing we did like for our
guestbook and stuff oh I should yeah -
we had pens again this was my sister and
niece it's a little idea we use floral
tape on just a regular pen and then put
a little flower stem from a similar
thing from Dollar Tree on top so then
when you put them all we had it sticking
and saying but it looks like a little
bouquet but their actual pens and as a
guestbook because we thought okay should
we get a guestbook we thought well I
mean we'll never look at it yeah and we
didn't invite you to their yeah really
smell it was less that's a huge way to
save money right then there keep it
small guys I mean I don't even like 50
people I mean so I mean we kept it I
mean we kept a small which was nice
because we knew and loved everybody that
was there yeah it wasn't like my great
aunt Gina's second cousin twice removed
it was just family that we loved in
France yeah so instead of doing a guest
book we did concoction Jessica did this
freehand she drew this Mickey well but
it was with a bowl and to caught to
comes right but still she drew with with
pencil and then with marker looks
exactly like a Mickey head ain't that
amazing some people didn't signed it and
now we have this hanging up so we look
at it all the time yeah and you could do
like wedding bells or you could do in
this candid robot on Amazon for like
$8.00 yeah
just got matte black and red sharpies do
but it's so easy to do to make your own
and the guest books like I remember
watching my sister pool her gas book out
for her wedding 10 years ago and you
know there were a couple pages filled
would think there were a lot of people
there but you know she's I've never even
looked at this and that's when it kind
of hit both of us we're not then why
have a guest look why are you ever you
know but this we see every day
I see I drop my blow dry my hair right
over there and I look at it every day
and it's so nicely I'm looking at people
I mean all their signatures and all that
stuff oh okay so the lanterns let's go
back to that real query showed the
smaller smaller okay so then we also got
two big ones $7.99 yes $7.99 so we got
all the little ones for the small tables
and then those for the big table we had
one on either side but our table yeah
yeah done induction no easy simple yeah
and I mean I suggest you in black and
white because it was pretty easy to find
stuff because anyway black and white is
just classy let's start with that and we
did have what flashes of silver just for
randomize right um but this was so easy
to find stuff that's black and stuff
that's white where's if you like teal
and maroon like you have to get the
right shade of everything and it's yeah
I can't even imagine doing that every
night I'm always amazed when people do
and they've got everything magically
good for you I love Asians or the money
I don't think like this very specific
shade of paint in this very specific
shade of brown like purple anyway so I
can't think of anything else I have the
video of the makeup that I wore and then
some of the makeup I wore I'd splurge on
soon as a special day but I have dupes
for every single makeup product in the
videos all like that I was very proud of
that video and the best part about
saving money on your wedding apart from
just saving money whether you're paying
for it whether your parents are paying
for it saving money's a beautiful thing
but we took that money that we saved and
we had a three-week long a honeymoon
that was out of this world amazing yeah
spend that money on yourself don't spend
it on the one day because the one day is
gonna be incredible if it's just you
regarded um
your Marian I'm dumb and I mean five
people it's going to be amazing no
matter what if you go to Oh Charlies for
the reception but I doesn't matter at
the end of the day you're married and
you're in love and it's a beautiful
thing and then spend money on the honey
date it was worth it best honeymoon you
could ever and we weren't worried about
money the ole time because we knew we
planned for it I know a lot of people
ask like how are you guys affording to
go to Paris and then Disneyland Paris
and Disney where were like oh because we
saved a log or a long time and we spent
so much yeah from the time we got
engaged we started saving and I am when
I keep a special travel account yeah and
so money every week goes into that so
that helped offset the costs as well and
then we thought you know this kind of
one that's like Doozers work I'm going
on a trip my so anyways so we'll wrap it
up there because this we could talk for
hours about this but it was lovely
