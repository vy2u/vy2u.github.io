going to share with you guys my roundup
of products that I feel like our way
over hyped on YouTube and whether or not
they're worth it so let's get into it
so I feel like there are some youtubers
or products that get so overhyped about
certain products and you know sometimes
I feel like products are just trendy and
so people that oh it's the most amazing
eyeshadow palette the whole wide world
because it's trendy right now but it's
like what are they actually really good
are they actually worth $50 for that
palette or is it just kind of a it's
really cool right now because it just
came out kind of a thing
so I'm here to break it down for you so
I'm doing this video with eBay I have
worked with eBay a million times in the
past more than any other company I love
eBay it's an easy website it's free to
use
you go to it if you want to get cash
back on things that you are buying you
literally go to ebay you type in the
store say Sephora is still getting over
a cold sorry so you go to Ebates you
type in the store you're shopping at
maybe it's Sephora for example and then
you click on it it takes you to Sephora
and anything you buy on that shopping
trip online you get cash back on so
Sephora currently is at eight percent
cash back which is higher than it
usually is but it's only at that 8%
until January 16th so if you want to get
I think it's usually around like four or
five percent so if you want to get that
higher percentage and you know there's
something you're planning on buying
anyway buy it soon while you can get
that cash back because I mean that's a
pretty big difference that's like double
the cash strapped that you normally get
but it just goes into your bank account
and if you use my link to join you get a
$10 welcome bonus which is sweet that's
what I got when I first originally
joined years and years ago because I

the info on how to enter so I would say
about half of these products are just
brand new products I just bought from
Sephora I just got yesterday so it's
first impressions and then half of them
are products I've had for a while and I
already know how I feel about them so
it's kind of a mixed bag but a lot of
these some of these are brand new that
people are talking about a lot like this
past month and I want to let you guys
know right away whether it's worth you
spending your hard-earned money on it or
not I'm like sweaty I need to like roll
up my sleeves
let's start with the most obvious hyped
product YouTube based sweet peach
palette now I went to their event like
many many many many other youtubers and
it was amazing absolutely amazing Tyler
my husband has our vlog Channel and he
is working on the blog it should be out
here in the next week so if it's already
off our blog from being there you can
see a lot of youtubers behind the scenes
and stuff like that
I will link it below I got to meet toppy
who I love I met I'll use lipstick who I
absolutely love I meant silly youtubers
that I just looked up to for so long
really really cool experience that
doesn't mean to make us amazing and I
will always be honest with you guys
about whether it's actually worth it or
not
it doesn't matter if a company sent me
to an event I got to tell you guys the
honest truth because you guys are why
I'm here period
so this palette is very good is it my
favorite palette in the world no I feel
like like there's this one this one
shade in the middle called candied peach
that's got glitter and it just the
glitter falls out everywhere it's a
really pretty peach color but it's a
little bit kind of powdery kind of
splotchy and glittery and it gets
everywhere so that shade is one that's
unusable straight off the bat I do think
the color range is kind of interesting
and when I've heard Jerrod from Too
Faced explained it and talks about you
know it's all the different colors of a
peach from the Rye
to the outside to the you know the leads
that you know all those different kinds
of things which i think is a great idea
I really think that two-face is
fantastic with their ideas they think
outside of the box they do things that
other companies aren't doing and then
other companies want to copy and I
applaud them for that again there's
another glittery shade called top derby
to me and it's very glittery it just
gets everywhere
I do love like there's the shade called
luscious an amazing shimmery shade I
mean like top-notch unbelievable quality
and that's what we feel like they're
shimmery shades are always great quality
but I do think some of their kind of
medium shades like that well that one's
really really pretty but then there's
this kind of medium shimmer brown and
it's kind of okay so I don't think it's
all 100% amazing quality do I think most
of it is BS - I think it smells amazing
absolutely and also Y which is fYI if
you watch workaholics they say fly all
the time for FYI which so now I like
it's in my vernacular and I can't get
rid of it why they taste like peaches as
well and it's true for the chocolate
palette I remember when I told you guys
about that you guys are like what and
then you all like swapped it and then
tasted the swatch you were like holy
moly that tastes like chocolate like
face job like a testy role you know I
mean but these taste like peach they
absolutely taste like peach now should
you go looking at a bunch no you're
going to get sick but it does and you
got to try it once I'm just saying but I
like it I used a lot do I think you need
to go out and spend 40 50 dollars on it
now you don't need to if you have sheets
like this already
don't worry about it if you have nothing
like this and you're really drawn to
peaches and you're really drawn to these
colors then go for it because it's a
good palette I mean just the same I
really like the chocolate palette
there's semi-sweet palette I mean I like
their shadows I do think they're limited
edition stuff not this necessarily but
like some of their other ones I don't
think they're there quality is as good
as these just saying but I do like it
do I think it's 100% worth the huge hype
it's gotten
understand that a lot of these youtubers
are hyping it because they got it for
free as that I and that you know they
went to this event and I'm so thankful
and I love so many Tuesday products but
this one it's good do I think it's you
need to run out and get it tomorrow this
is the visor art or is it busy art I
have looked it out I still don't know
how to say it it's the eyeshadow palette
that so many people keep talking about I
finally bought it I just got in the mail
yesterday I've kind of used it a little
bit today I use it on my lower lash line
today this is they're all matte palette
called neutral meds there's zero one top
like the first palette this looks like
the Sonia Kashuk palette that I used to
own I'm so mad at myself for declaring
because I want to compare it so badly I
will look for it and if I can find it
online I'll put on the screen here these
books so so similar in shade I have to
assume that Sonia Kashuk maybe copied
this I don't know how long has been out
but probably for a while because it's
like a makeup artist favorite and I was
actually showing this to my husband and
I was like you know it's so funny
because this is so expensive that the
packaging looks so dinky you know it's
just like a plastic lid plastic backing
but I said you know if you're a makeup
artist which is where this kind of all
got started why this is so loved and
recommended it's because makeup artists
love it it's amazing shadows what I've
tried was really really nice these are
like once white unbelievable like let me
I'm going to do like this orange one
here you swipe it once and it's
unbelievable pigment unbelievable and so
you know it's one of those things that I
wasn't a great swatch I guess they blend
so effortlessly so effortlessly I think
I didn't know what I was missing
does that make sense like I didn't know
how well shadows could blend until I
tried this this morning when I was
getting ready now like I said I'm only
using some of this I mixed it with
another one I'm gonna mention but like I
was using some of these kind of lighter
medium colors in the crease I mean it
would be just a little bit in the crease
and I would grab a blob
and start blending it and it would blend
all the way up if I wanted it to I mean
it just kept spreading wherever I wanted
it to go is go it with teeth blending
like I could never ever ever tried a
palate like this except for one other
one that I'm going to mention so
unbelievable so if you've got the money
or you've got a gift card or you're
really into life they've got a couple of
pallets you know if you look at them and
you're like oh my gosh I would use every
shade in that palette I think it'd be
worth it if you're only going to use
three shades in it it's not going to be
worth it right but these the quality I
get I get why these are so expensive and
why they're so highly revered you know
what I think about this versus the
two-faced one it's just comical because
this is so many steps above when it
comes to you know when you see a model
in a magazine you're like wow like that
I shadow that's amazing it's something
like this that they're using because
it's just so flawless and even a
beginner could use this and it will
blend so beautifully it will look like
you know what you're doing you know what
I mean I just didn't know what I was
missing I think that's the best way to
describe it so the next power I want to
mention is very is amazing when it comes
to blend ability as well and this is the
Kat Von D shade and light palette this
has the same amount of shades but it
does have three they're bigger I have to
admit I kind of wish they were all the
same size and like they were all just a
little bit bigger just because these are
not necessarily three shades out you
just come enough to use that huge pan up
but these are amazing shadows again one
swipe crazy pigmented type products or
tight shadows and they blend so well so
I would say the next best thing I found
to devise are visi art palettes is this
honestly it might be just on par and
honestly when you look at the shades and
these you know there's a couple of
differences but they're very similar
shade absolutely amazing products I
think this is a little more travel
friendly if you're big into that but I
would say just as good very very
blendable this might be a tiny bit
better but that doesn't necessarily
mean you need to get this I would say
look at it and if you're really
seriously thinking about it pick which
one you would use more of the shades of
and that will make it worth your money
the last palette I'm going to mention
today is the Anasazi on Modern
Renaissance I just bought this it came
in the mail with the visor palette I
didn't think I would ever buy this I'm
going to be honest like if I were to a
films an anti haul video which I keep
thinking about doing if you have to be
interested in please let me know because
I love watching Kimberly Clark's videos
on he and I all did a lot of people are
doing them now forget to watch a lot of
them I love those like products should
just not going to buy that you're not
going to spend your money on and I think
it promotes a really good sense of you
know you don't always need to buy
everything that comes out I love it so
if you'd be interested let me know but I
ended up doing it and this palette I'm
just now newly into more rosy red gold
orange shades and I'm wearing mostly
this on my eyes today I snapped about it
this morning and I said what of course
by the time this video is up it's long
gone but what I was wearing but you know
I'm wearing some of red ocher here I'm
wearing some of Venetian red in my
crease some of Cyprus umber as well all
over my lid I have antique bronze and
then I put Primavera which is this gold
shimmery like kind of in the middle of
my lid he's not beautiful do I think you
need to run out and get it
no only buy it if you're really into red
shades you know what I'm saying I bought
it because I was like finally I was like
I just want to try it I'm into these
shades now but if I had no desire to try
pinks and reds and oranges you do not
need this palette you won't use it I
mean that's just common sense but I
think sometimes you just need to share
it for someone so I can beat up someone
for you if you're not ever going to use
these pinks and oranges and red do not
buy this palette it makes no sense but
if you are totally into them these
shadows are amazing quality they blend
really well
these shimmers are so so beautiful oh my
gosh like stunning stunning beautiful I
don't know if you can see those swatches
I love this so much and I thought I
wouldn't like the
like the light paint resolve it but I
actually kind of like it like seeing it
versa might actually that's beautiful
and I love that it's all like artistic
type names and color type names
I just think of traveling to Europe and
like the Renaissance and things like
that so it makes me a lot of even more
all right let's move on I literally only
have one lip product that I think was
overly hyped this year and it is the
NARS Velvet lip glide this is totally
worth your money
you guys I it is so good I'm wearing it
today and this isn't a shade bound oh my
gosh it is the most comfortable lipstick
lip gloss I have to like say it all
together because it it goes on like a
lip gloss lipstick because it's so
pigmented and it's not moving all around
but it's also not like set like a matte
lipstick or like a matte liquid lipstick
and you know matte liquid lipsticks had
such a big you know time in our lives
recently and I still like them for
certain things but for everyday this is
perfect because lipsticks can kind of
run and then you look kind of crazy and
you're worried about it throughout your
workday but this is one of those things
that you don't don't worry about and
it's comfortable so it's not drying your
lips out and it looks beautiful and it's
not going all over your face
now I did use this with a lip liner
today and pretty funny this is the
colourpop lip liner in the shade found
so it's kind of weird they both have the
same name and honestly I realized that
just today this is an amazing formula
it's almost whipped and rising away the
l'oreal infallible like lip glosses that
are kind of whipped and I love that
formula this is very very similar
they're not exactly the same but they
are similar where it's just comfortable
it's not matte but it's also not crazy
glossy it does have a little Sheen to it
but I love the shade as well I am so
excited to try other shapes from this
range because I think it is so amazing
it's kind of one of those things that
I'm like gosh this makes me want to get
rid of like so many other lip glosses
that I'm like forget it now that is this
I don't need anything else it's so
amazing I would say for that pick one
shade you know you'll wear if you wanted
everyday
found is perfect but if you want like a
red or something like that
pick one shade you know you'll wear look
up watches online and buy the one try it
out you'll probably follow them all
doesn't want more but just try one out
to start okay so continuing on to space
I'm going to try and get quicker because
I feel like I talk forever so one primer
that has been so hyped on YouTube is
this it cosmetics bye bye chords primer
now they sent this to me quite a while
ago and it's I love that it's a squeezy
tube at the pump that is my favorite
kind of packaging for things like this
and it's a white primer but what's kind
of interesting about it is it feels more
like a lotion and I feel like a lot of
like poreless type primers are very
silicone feeling kind of not waxy but oh
velvety feel to it and sometimes that
can be good sometimes it's bad depending
on your skin type if you got really dry
skin sometimes it doesn't work it kind
of depends but I've got dry skin
everywhere but my nose is typically not
dry so I can usually use those kinds of
primers all I knows but this one is very
much more like a lotion and I think
that's why so many people like it it's a
comfortable primer to where it almost
feels moisturizing and velvety at the
same time and so if you've never if
you've tried a bunch of poreless primers
and you have felt like it just doesn't
work for your skin and yet you still
have pores that you won't fill then this
is the primer for you because it's it
does both I mean it moisturizes but it
fills in primers it doesn't dry you out
do I think it's like the most
poreless primer in the world no because
again it does kind of have that lotion
II feel to it as well so I think this is
ideal if you've got normal to dry skin
and you've got pores that maybe you want
filled or you just want it to be a
little smoother in certain areas this
does the job alright so the next thing
is with new this year it's the Kat Von D
lofted concealer cream
now her Lockett line is cute but because
I have dry skin I've tried the
foundation and I absolutely hated it I
got rid of it because my skin is too dry
and it's very mattifying if that's what
you need you will love it it's not that
it's about that
it's not right for me but this is
awesome because it's I don't want it
it's kind of like a watered-down version
of her locket concealer and I don't mean
that in a bad way I mean that in a great
way because it's a little bit more
creamy that's why it's called her
concealer cream and it's got a delta
applicator you know very standard setup
here but it is the creamiest but also
the most it's got very high coverage
very easy to blend into your skin it
does settle into fine lines but honestly
it is very rare for me to find a high
coverage concealer that doesn't so I
typically will get some kind of powder
to set it with so it doesn't crawl into
my fine lines anymore it is amazing
because it's it's I don't want to say
hydrating but kind of hydrating in a way
moisturizing maybe as a better word but
also high coverage and that is very hard
to find you conceal as it strikes that
balance a lot of them are really really
thick if you want really high coverage
so very thick so they're not easy to
blend they take a while to use they
don't look as good whereas this one is
just as high coverage but it's way
easier to blend and so I this is an
amazing concealer I think it's totally
worth buy the next product is the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist now I did a
whole video on this I will link it below
if you're interested on my you know more
in-depth feelings towards this but if
you have very dry skin you might like it
but I've got decently dry skin and it
was way too much dewy it was way too
dewy
it's got good skincare ingredients
according to the brand and they've got
so many other products that I am
interested in trying because of what the
brand stands for and the packaging could
not be more beautiful guys it's not
worth your money it is it's a way I
don't even want to spray on my face
because it will ruin it that is that's
how much I don't love it am I going to
get rid of it right now no because I
think there's a time in a place you
could spray it on a brush and kind of
brush it where you would naturally
highlight and I think it will kind of
illuminate that area but to just spray
it all over your face and making your
face look like a disco ball and I don't
necessarily it doesn't necessarily
we're in it but it just got something in
it that makes it look so dewy even if
you just did one spritz it's too much
and I haven't found any youtuber that
I've watched online that has said you
know they'll all kind of stay it's
really doing that you should buy it but
I'm like no it's really doing and you
should not buy it because you won't use
it up to this crazy so if you love it
I'm so sorry I don't mean to offend you
and maybe you've just got the exact
right skin type for it but for me I put
it on and I was like now and everyone
was like why is your face look wet and
I'm like oh my gosh is it so bad
so no no no and I know some people like
it so if you do explain why below like
what kind of skin type you have because
I don't mean that fear people wrong if
it would be right to them so let us know
below sound off on the message board
below remember a o/l member chat room
remember Ange uh yeah nanba next the
hourglass vanish foundation sickness is
so hyped up this year people won't stop
talking about it but I get because it's
the I've tried a million foundation
sticks all of them looked horrible on me
they be drying our god oh my god it's
like it won't blend and it's dry and you
can just seal it I look scaly and it's
not even it's patchy this stuff I don't
know what they put in it but you will
kind of dot it all over your face and I
use the hourglass brush I do really
think it works best with it but I don't
think you necessarily have to buy it but
I'll diffusing the smoke so slight and
it blended everywhere and it just keeps
blending it's creamy I don't think it's
like super moisturizing but it's not
drying so if you already have a little
bit of dry skin like I do you're still
going to see the dry skin it's not a
miracle worker but out of all of the
cream foundations this one is the best
I've ever used and I still reach for it
every time I sell and any time I'm going
to go to an event or be on camera
because it looks so flawless you don't
need a lot and it just looks amazing
it's the best foundation I've found for
my skin where I want it to look flawless
if that makes sense so I love it
the next product and this is a first
impression is the cover FX custom
cover drops I am so tired of people
hearing people talk about this product
money I am so I finally ordered one
I just got it online last night it's a
little medicine dropper let me pull it
out I got it in the shade whoo I just
tailed it why oh why did I do that
guys I mean what was I thinking so I
bought it in the shade in ten and I
think this what I wanted was okay back
about just the idea this is that you can
either wear it alone like almost as a
foundation or you can mix it with
moisturizers to make your own foundation
with a moisturizer you love what cool
idea right well I think actually this
shade might be just right it might be a
little light but the idea is that I want
to mix it with darker foundations to
lighten it just a hair and I think this
might be perfect for that so it's a very
very thin consistency as evidenced by
the fact that I just dumped it
everywhere am i turning upside down it
instantly poured right out so mad at
myself because these are not cheese I
mix it with a moisturizer today has to
try it out and it actually really did
look nice I didn't put it on my face I
was just mixing on my hand just to kind
of try it out
it also looks nice on its own I actually
took some of this and I'll even do it
right now
and I put some on my nose because it is
lighter I just kind of blended it my
nervous red so easily in this did a
great job of kind of evening out that
redness on its own without any other
moisturizers so I liked it for that as
well of course you get darker shades if
you've got a bunch of foundations that
are too light or maybe like in the
summer you want to be able to darken
them that's a fantastic use do I think
you've got to have this in your
collection no but do I think it's nice
if you know you already have you know
like if you know you don't want to buy
foundations for the summer times just
because you're a little darker by a
shade that's a little darker for you and
mix it it's kind of a perfect tool for
that reason and I think that's really
cool
so again I don't think this is something
necessary and your makeup collection but
again if you've got a very specific kind
of thing that you want it for is then
be worth it that's what all stick some
people by like five shades I'm like how
to use the money by five shades I don't
understand that almost done this is the
longest video ever so these are so big
right now these are the RMS beauty
little like cream highlighters so I have
two shades living Luminizer is the one
I've had the longest it's a white pearly
shade the idea of this is that you can
put it on as the highlighter but it
looks healthy so a lot of celebrities
are using it just in this region right
here because it looks like this healthy
glow it's not a glitter it's not a
powder it's not even a cream highlighter
you can see your skin through it and I
think that's why it's so beautiful I
also have master mixer and this is one I
just recently got I have on today it's
the only highlight I have on and I think
it looks unbelievable
because again it did this one's a little
bit like if you look at the two of them
living Luminizer it really is white and
master mixer is a little bit darker
these are so beautiful they look so
natural in the skin you can see your
skin through it and yet it adds this
glow to it it's not just glitter it's
not shimmer but it just it's almost like
gloss but it dries so it's the coolest
most perfect products and I totally get
why so many makeup artists are using it
all the time because it looks so
beautiful
both in person and in photographs it's
kind of one of those perfect products
it's a glass little case and a metal lid
really nice simple small sleek packaging
one of my favorite products I've tried
this your hands down I use it all the
time
I really just think it looks so healthy
and I think it's a great alternative to
powder highlighters again I've got dry
skin and in the winter I think the more
power I'm adding my face even as a
highlighter makes my skin well but it
just makes me look older because it's
highlighting any areas I've got
craziness or like wrinkles so I think
this is the perfect alternative so if
you're just kind of tired of adding more
and more powder layers of powder to your
face try one of these I think I like
master mix they're better than living
Luminizer they're both beautiful they're
glass things I mention are these Kevin
of Quan sculpting powders now I have had
the
medium shade forever this is the second
one I've owned because it's the perfect
kind of grayish Brown for contouring but
today they now not today but now they
sell the light shade and that's what I'm
wearing on my face today I am it like
properly contoured in a while I did
today
well not properly I'm not a mega barniz
but so the one on top here is light in
the next one is medium and I think light
even though it really does look like it
really I think is the perfect contour
for me like I loved medium for so long
but you do have to kind of use a light
hand because it is a little bit deeper
but these are true contour powders
they're a little bit more cool toned you
know you don't necessarily want a
bronzer shade there if you're trying to
create a shadow so I mean these are just
amazing but the light one is like oh yes
finally I heard about it I know
kathleenlights mentioned it the light
shade and I was like hold the phone I
didn't know they sold that and so I
literally got on just then and bought it
but it is amazing it doesn't move
throughout the day these are expensive
but totally worth your money if that's
what you're in the market for if you're
wanting a bronzer that's not what these
are but if you're wanting something to
truly create a shadow these are
incredible if you are a little deeper
than me you want medium if you're around
my skin tone at all you definitely want
light so if you're interested in winning

and share things on Facebook click the
bell so you get notified of all of my
new videos and anything I'm uploading on

declutter as well so I'm getting rid of
a lot of products that are just sitting
in my clutch and I'm not really using
over here in my drawers I've got tons of
things I'm not using that maybe I just
don't like that's a great way if you
watch my declutter to find out what I'm
loving and what I'm kind of hating it's
