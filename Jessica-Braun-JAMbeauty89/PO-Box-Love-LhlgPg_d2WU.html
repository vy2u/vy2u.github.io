came from legian so I'm not gonna polish
that because I went to the gym I was
like good for you Jess no but I wasn't
gonna film I film videos actually
earlier today and then I was out running
errands and doing all kinds of stuff and
then when I went to the post office I
had some packages there in my people box
and I was so freaking excited so I
figured I would open them on camera I
know I know some people that send me the
stuff and other ones I don't so it's
it's just really nice I'm excited so
we'll start with this this actually I
got a while ago and I wanted to share it
with you guys because I kind of opened
it in the arms of oh maybe I'll do it on
camera so I held on to it for quite a
while actually so I'm gonna see if there
is like a this is from Samantha and I
recognize your name I don't know if you
comment on a lot of my videos or not and
that's the thing I've said this recently
to but a lot of you guys that comment
all the time I feel like I know you like
I know your name and every time I see it
and it's so funny because sometimes you
guys would be like hey it's um it's
so-and-so and it'll do like I don't know
they'll act like I won't know who they
are I'm like I know exactly who you are
and it's just so you know I don't know
so first of all she sent me a picture of
her little baby girls so cute but it
sounds like she sells tone 45 stuff so
she said she sent me like a body wrap of
facial wrap some green shoes a green a
green drink mix and then some like other
like makeup goodies so let's dig in I've
never heard of tone 45 of you guys so
it's got its the it works ultimate body
applicator and it looks like it's
supposedly like tones your skin okay I
mean come on now that'd be awesome
and then I'm assuming this is one of the
raps she was talking about like maybe a
facial wrap yeah I think so and then
there's like a info about it so then
there's this lip and I moisturizing
cream gel and it's I guess from the same
brand ur from it works and says you put
on the eye and lips in the morning your
evening okay I'm well I'm all for
moisturization so that's awesome
and then so now it looks like these are
okay I'll use the heck out of these
these are like the little green drink
mixes she said and then there's these
see the little chews and I don't know if
those are like meal replacements I need
to like take the time to read all this
before I you know decorate it I don't
want to take all the time right now with
you guys okay and then she also sent me
all some little lip glosses it's kind of
funny I've been decluttering but I still
like getting new stuff it's not like I
don't like getting it you know so it's
really tricky for me but lip glosses are
fun and I actually don't have that many
lip glosses like I it's funny I really
don't I really don't which I mean I have
more than I'm gonna need but compared to
like what most people with like my hobby
your job has I really don't so that is a
nice addition Thank You Samantha that's
awesome I'm excited to try all those
different things because I've just never
tried anything like that oh this is from
my friend Linville and Lilly her
daughter and I might need scissors to
cut this open I cut open a lot of these
so at least I wouldn't have to but I
might try to but they live in Australia
and they've sent me something before and
it was just lovely and they're like one
of my favorite things let me go grab it
that I own is this little stuffed animal
that is a wombat I'm probably gonna
bring it to my classroom because of
course why not and then if we talk about
strumming I think that oh this is from
Australia I love little things like that
and my little Minnie Mouse stuffed
animal that I adore okay so so then you
have something step before interesting
facts so let's see if there's like a
little card or something in there of
course there is if you live in another
country 70-something send me a card or
anything because I it's so cool to me
because eventually I want to just
freakin travel everywhere who doesn't
want to do that but to me it just feels
so cool to get something from somewhere
I've never been it does brighten my day
well you are so sweet so it says there's
a keyring in here it has the Australian
flag on it is for Tyler okay when she
was here while I was opening this he's
gonna die and the rest is for me he is
going to die because he is more of a
traveler than I
like he's the one that really got me
into this and he's gonna die that you
thought to send him something so that
was so thoughtful and that is that would
mark the very first time and he want to
send something for him to me he's gonna
freak out these little pencils that say
Jess all over them oh I'm gonna use
these I'm gonna use the heck out of
these that is so thoughtful oh there's
this charm that says Jessica gosh these
are so thoughtful
I wonder if I can't it is truly a term I
might put it on that little charm
bracelet that I have or maybe I have
like a necklace I think I could put it
on two off to the side how I want to use
it oh so sweet this is funny actually
this is a dreamcatcher and I love let me
see if I can find like where the top
there's the hanging part I love
dreamcatcher so I used to have one as a
kid and I just love the idea of it and I
have Native American in me and they
really well I don't know if all Native
Americans believe in dream catchers but
a lot of them you know believe in them
or at least used to and I just love the
idea of it so this is really really cool
and I was actually looking at these
recently when we were in Michigan I
don't know why they were there but they
were although there's a lot of Native
America it doesn't matter um and I
almost bought one and I did and I'm so
glad I didn't because this is way cooler
and just so thoughtful okay so here this
is the keychain for Tyler he is going to
love this that's really cool
and says I'll show you down under I
don't know if you can it'll show through
with that glare and then she also sent
me all these are cute it's a keychain I
gotta take this one out it's a keychain
but it looks like there's like little
koala bears and things like that oh my
gosh there's like a ton of little koala
bears on there how adorable is that I'm
such a sucker for a little like
keychains and little doodads like that
so that Bob Thank You Lily yeah just
that was so sweet both of you ladies are
just the best just the best okay I'm
like sweating now I guess I could what
am I wearing I'm wearing like my workout
shirt under it I might I'm sweating okay
sorry you guys can laugh at me look at
this tan line
I was wearing sunblock - it's like SPF
55 but I guess I didn't really so let's
see this is from my friend Renee who is
one that she's been a subscriber of mine
for a while she always comment so I
always I just know her I feel like I
know her and there's so many of you out
there like that for me so first things
first I cut it open ahead of time and
there are little like Disney stickers
everywhere the first thing I noticed
when I picked it up was these two little
Mickey had she drew like on the top and
like so freakin thoughtful I have the
best subscribers in the universe and
then okay so there's all this tissue
paper really pretty I'm not saying that
tissue paper unreason sinew I'll see
that like literally at Christmastime I'm
the one going around collecting bags and
boxes and like saving them for next year
I'll be the first to admit it and I
don't care because those things are so
expensive anyway okay first of all she
made this
are you kidding it's oh my gosh I'm
gonna cherish this it's a little Mickey
but it's the graduating like Mickey
Minnie whatever says congratulations
you've worked so hard and deserve to
enjoy your summer thank you also did you
guys just see me spit everywhere
I lost my groom this is so thoughtful I
adore that and then okay another little
card hmm Hangul she said she hopes I
continue to make videos for a long time
I plan on making them for a long time
that's really that's so sweet so so
sweet
holy crap gosh you guys are ridiculous
look at this are you kidding me
and yet again there's little Mickey's
and Minnie's and Donald's trivia
question does anyone know what my
favorite character is Disney character
not like the princesses cuz I love like
all of the princesses I don't think I
could pick a fair one but does anyone
know what my favorite Disney character
out of like the classic crew is down
below if you think you know I'm curious
to see if anyone knows it all right so
this is adorable first things I'm seeing
our tarts now I don't know Renee or if
any of you guys know I burn tarts like
crazy and my sister got me hooked on
them so I always Macintosh that's what I
figured so I love burning them I have a
couple tart warmers
especially in the fall which of course
is coming up and actually today's
weather feels like fall here and then
it's amazing even though it totally
shouldn't but I'm not complaining so
awesome awesome awesome I will use the
heck out of that so I don't even know
where to begin this is insane
alright it's so pretty I don't like okay
hold on I'm digging it because this is
cracking me up if you watching my videos
you'll know first of all that was a very
honest laughs now I'm embarrassed my
life is so bad like it's so loud um I
always get Playtex sports and like my
influence or boxes or like every month I
get one I'm like this is great I never
have to buy him clearly she's been
watching because she wrote just so you
don't need to buy them this month and
that is the funniest thing I've ever
seen in my entire life
thank you I don't need to buy on this
one this is fantastic that is hilarious
and thoughtful and the weirdest way very
thoughtful okay I thought this may be
your style my best friend Emily's
favorite character is Daisy Duck and I
remember when she told me that it was
like Daisy Duck really but oh it's a
little blotch that is so cute it's very
Daisy which totally is my style totally
I'm like so boring with my style but
okay so this one says I know you like
this powder so you might like this blush
to try to see if I can guess which it is
huh huh nobody grows oh she's gonna be
sad oh that's not okay it's the Rimmel
match perfection oh don't you hate the
male it looks like a really pretty color
too I didn't even know they make these
though so now I mean luckily this isn't
you I mean I might I felt almost wonder
if I can go to the store me like hey
this broke cuz I get it I don't know if
they probably would do that
if that was so thoughtful though because
you know I love the Rimmel what you
doodle you know what I'm talking about
dang it alright so this one says
something I have and never used maybe
you'll like it as much as your others
well it's a mary-kate product subtle
tanning lotion you know I'm gonna like
it I first of all I use natural oil at
crazy although right now that I've got
I'm like burnt ish
I don't even like need any more color
but I will use this so thank you and
there it's so expensive like even just
natural glow and I've got the Mary Kay
ones probably even more expensive so
awesome and totally I'll use it all
right this is something I never use much
but since you're trying Mary Kay you may
be able to give us some love thank you
I'm glad I haven't filmed my Mary Kay
review video because I can try these
things out and kind of add it to my list
and growing collection of Mary Kay oh
yeah what's funny is I remember these
old to old school versus and they're
separate like silver so it comes with a
like little lip gloss in like the window
if you will of it and then let me see
what side you open it on these are
really pretty so it all comes together
first of all that blush is gorgeous are
you kidding me
and I love those shadows so this is
great I probably will give you side of
this so thank you Renee oh man my Mary
Kay collections getting out of control
this says I got this in a box box and it
just wasn't my color girl I feel yeah oh
it's a Rimmel one well I don't have this
guy I can already tell you I don't have
it Luna I have never owned this color
and it's like a peachy one oh I'll
totally wear that I might put it on
right now oh I mean it certainly is like
orange but like not in a more wearable
way because you know orange lips are so
in right now but I'm like no thanks I
don't think I'd wear it any other time
but like summer and spring but it's fun
what is I'll wear you know I like that
stuff alright so this one says I just
can't get over all the decorations I saw
you love this brand and only had one so
here's another feels like a nail pop I
do like this brand and I do only own one
no you're good you must watch every
video I it's orally and I have one and
it's in the shade lollipop and the
formula is so good this is like a really
pretty oh this will be pretty in like
the winter - what is this shade name
does it say all men to love I can't tell
but regardless this
a really pretty color so I probably
really will wear that it's like a
silvery white ha ha all right
this says because I know you love these
and it's like a little threesome here
I'm assuming it's a lip prop I do love
these these are lip butters ooh
what's shaded lollipop I don't you know
what is weird I feel like lollipop used
to be a different color than this don't
you guys I feel like I used someone
called lollipop but it was a really
light like purplish white color like it
was way too pale so that is just bizarre
do you guys know what I'm talking about
I feel like it used to be a different
one and now it's this which is totally
up my alley you're kidding no wear the
heck out of that this one is in the
shade candy apple that makes me think of
Snow White
that makes me want to be snow white for
Halloween that's that one there on the
bottom that's really pretty again like a
wearable red you know Renee was so sweet
I remember she like tweeted me or
something yeah I think I tweet with her
a lot I'm trying to think of its Twitter
Instagram but it is Twitter
she and I have tweeted back and forth
but she was saying that she wanted to
send me something but she said I know
you're decluttering no so I don't want
to like you know she said you can get
rid of whatever you want I thought that
was sweet of her to think of you know
that I'm in a declutter mindset but at
the same time like I said it's still fun
getting new things it doesn't mean I'm
gonna never buy stuff because the
reality is this is one of my jobs and
it's one of my hobbies so of course I'm
gonna be trying new things out still
forever but yes
tutti-frutti to food Oh whoo okay bottom
one these are really pretty and again a
more wearable Orange so I'm excited to
give those a try
really all right this one just a little
guy this is so much stuff how long is
this video sorry guys and I saw another
package oh it's a Milani shadow which
those are always good it's in the shade
clover it's a really pretty green that's
a really pretty green then really well
on that many colorful shadows so this
would be a good one to add to my
collection
cuz in green in the realm of colorful
shadows I usually will opt for green I
don't know why I just always have okay
oh this one doesn't know
this is because no one can rock a red
lip like you can that's so sweet because
I would disagree with you and I'm sure
we all do the same thing to ourselves
we're like oh I can't wear it but then
everyone felt like I wear it on a video
and you guys are so sweet about it but
still in my head I'm like 'no but I
still like to wear it because you guys
are always so sweet about it like so
that was thoughtful ooh this is a wet
wild one in Perdido cinnamon ooh these
are really cool um formula that's it
look at that oh my gosh that is amazing
and then this is a Mary Kay one it's
been sunny citrus ooh these are all
orange e tones but again girl you're
keeping me in style because these are
also in right now so thanks yeah
alright next one I've got to wipe off
these swatches before I get it all over
myself okay wait okay ooh I've never
tried these this is the L'Oreal lip
gloss another orange one although I'm
sure it's like more of a sheer you know
um yeah it's it's mostly sheer you can't
you can kind of see it does have a
little peachy so it might go well with a
peachy but I've actually never tried any
of the lip glosses so awesome again
another thing I can actually get to try
out alright so this one looks more like
a you wrap these well you guys are
always the ones that wrap things it
cracks me up cuz you guys are way better
rappers than I am
oh this you know what I think I own this
or used to own this but it was one of
those that I regretted getting rid of
because I don't have another pink this
shade so it's kind of funny and awesome
that you said it's me I don't know if it
was in this exact shade it might have
been forever fuchsia it's such a pretty
pink and I remember regretting oh look
at that
but I remember regretting it because I
was like I don't have another one the
shader should have gotten rid of it
there Jess who this one had a real
ribbon on it cute this may be no posh
yes
Mary Kate nail polish now I will admit I
have a Mary Kay polish that was one of
their limited edition ones and it was
not great so I'll be interested
this is totally a color I would love me
I love like pink so much my favorite
color
alright so this one this is way too much
stuff for night NYC oh it's a lip gloss
that's not true I have tried my sea lip
gloss so it's gonna say I haven't but
I've never tried this kind it's the big
bold NYC this is awesome I kind of love
how giant it is whoa okay this is like
comically large but kind of like uh
that's a classic NYC smell this is a
gorgeous color though oh now I want to
put it on this is hilariously big but
that is such a pretty color that might
be the lip product I'm most excited
about okay next step you know what I'm
gonna know I'm not gonna wipe it up I
was gonna wipe it off a tissue paper but
I think that's a bad idea
come on another net blue OPI come on not
Madonna ooh ooh it's saying golden rules
it's an OPI one but it looks really like
opaque for a gold which is gonna be nice
because I feel like most gold polishes
are kind of a little bit too transparent
so you need a million coats or you have
to do it over white but this one looks
yeah really opaque so that is awesome
that's gonna be pretty at the holidays
no or in the fall like with another
orange polish or some I'm getting really
excited okay awesome alright so then
it's like this is a little lipstick ooh
this is a nipple one which kind is it
it's the taste or a kiss of milk and
honey I've never tried this one
whoo it literally smells like honey I
have the mint and minerals but I've
never tried the mocha honey and that's
when I always kind of like have my eye
on to try so very excited to try that
this is oh my gosh I'm sorry I'm like
looking past and I'm really excited
about something
okay this looks like maybe a shadow it's
a Rimmel one it's in black cab and it's
one of those one of these you know this
is awesome and I really don't have many
black and silvery ones I usually opt for
other coach so again this would be a
nice addition to my collection alright
so this says my sister and I got these
to try and it just didn't work for our
skin but we know you love this brand
well I do love this brand
oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh and I
travel all the time
I'm really excited can you tell so these
are Paula's Choice which I love like
they don't make a single skin care
product that is bad for your skin cuz
like that is their whole thing there are
so many skincare companies that are like
good for skin and they're made by
doctors but they actually aren't like
they're filled with fragrance and
they're filled with all kinds of
ingredients that actually are harmful
for most people skin not all and that's
where I learned about on like they have
like a reviews where you can read about
the other products and you can read
about theirs too but oh my gosh so this
is a whole set in there all travel size
which is so awesome regular strength and
this is extra strength and it's a two
week trial kit and it looks like there's
exfoliating things I don't even it yeah
sorry cleanser daily skin clearing
treatment I'm so excited I am so excited
you have no idea I'm excited I know
he'll love Paula's Choice okay the last
thing in this is I can tell us a coffee
mug I'm already excited it says because
I know you will love this and if you've
caught me in any of my videos where I'm
drinking out of coffee it's usually out
of an awesome mug it has Minnie and
Mickey Oh
oh my gosh I will cherish this forever
I totally am such a nerd weirdo about
things like this this is so so awesome
oh my gosh oh my gosh Renee thank you

same time so I figured and everything's

shower gel and the perfumed lotion which
again perfect for travel and this is one
of those hold on let me get it off
without like spilling it everywhere
this is no I want to put it on this is
one of those perfumes that I always
smell but I'm like I have three perfumes
that I try and keep it at that because I
see people with big collection so I'm
like dang like that would drive me crazy
cuz I'd be worried about it going bad
and however it is often have like a
million choices long story short I'm
really excited because this is one that
I always smell and I love the way it
smells I think it just smells so
grown-up and modern and but still really
feminine anyway so it's like you knew

assuming it has a bad word she come okay
this is so adorable this is something I
would do she covered it in tape and rope
sorry it said a mean word that's so
thoughtful who thinks of that this is so
awesome and okay I'm one of those nerdy
people and I wonder if anyone else is
this dumb not dumb just different
I like instead of if I have a book of
recipes I go to the book of recipes
before I go to an app because I love the
idea it's just so it's sad that it's
old-fashioned but it totally is to go to
a book instead of like an app or to a
website to find a recipe I love to see
if I can find in the book and use a book
recipe or like I had little recipe cards
like and I write recipes on them still
cuz I am old-fashioned like that but
it's the same thing like this like I
would rather look through here and find
a way to use something than online first
so I'm nerdy like that I will totally
use this book like I will actually use
it
