yarn okay let's open it this is so cool
that is awesome
is it a pen is it yeah am I breaking it
oh no way the in the inner part is there
this is so cool I probably won't use it
though I just want like you said to
display it cuz it is maybe I'll use it
though it's so cool
oh my gosh okay unless you sent me a lot
this says egypt is the land of kings and
Pharaohs so I got you a ruler that's
funny that's good stuff oh this is cool
this is so fun I feel like I traveled
there and got to pick out all the fun
like little things in the shops this is
so much fun okay
SOG I'm making these according to him
most of the components are hand-picked
from the ocean it's like wrapped up the
chips make sure I didn't this is so
beautiful
can you guys hear that doesn't that make
you think of the beach oh my gosh
from Sharm el-sheikh in south of Egypt
southern Egypt there's a beach that
makes sense this is so beautiful oh my
gosh I just can't get over the sound it
makes - I love this I love it
these are so wonderful okay I think I
reached the bottom
alright this says for all your little
notes
boy do I make a lot of little notes see
if I can get this this is so cool I
can't believe you knew I was obsessed
with Egypt awesome oh this is awesome oh
it's even cuter all the pages look like
that this is so cool oh and they all
have a different like pattern on each
this is so cool thank you so much Ali
this is just amazing
absolutely amazing oh you guys are
awesome to me okay so a few more things
I was sent this and I tried it I
repackage it so I could show it to you
guys cuz this a company sent me and I
said yeah maybe I'll try it we'll see so
they sent it and I tried the Mary Kay
one of this where it's like one of those
electronic brush and I liked it okay it
wasn't I mean I liked it okay it was the
only one I've ever used so I really
don't know exactly what I like in a like
spinning cleansing brush so they sent me
this one oh I didn't say the brand is
vitae good and it took me a while to
finally try it but I finally did and I
really like it it's it's very similar
but it has more attachment so for
example it's got one of these like
pumice II type
prince2 it as well which I really really
like and they also have the like giant
one
I really like it otherwise everything is
exactly the same as the Mary Kay one
it's about the exact same size I mean
there's really not much of a difference
between them and you just put the
attachments on them anyway I really like
it I think I like this one better than
the Mary Kay it just feels like it's got
a little bit more power to it and I like
that it's got more attachments than just
the two that the Mary Kay one comes with
so there's that I'll put info they did
send me and I think it's in the thing
they said that they would give a coupon
code and I'll put it below and it's 70
percent off of 99 dollars so it'd be $30
and free shipping in the US so I'll put
that below if you're interested because
well one hundred dollars would be a lot
to pay for something like this I know
people buy like the Clara Sonics for
that much but I'm not huge on these
types of things anyway so it's kind of a
slow crawl for me as I'm learning about
them and using them more but out of the
two I've tried I do like this one the
best so I'll put that stuff below if
you're interested all right is another
company sent me you guys heard of Nerium
I hadn't heard of it but I didn't know
why and they asked if they could send me
some stuff and I was like yes but I
don't know if I'll review it I don't
know you know which is usually what I
say and they said that's fine we'll send
it anywhere like okay so they sent me a
few things this is the Nerium firm body
contouring cream firm tighten and tone
that would be nice actually and if this
actually works which I've heard good
things that would be awesome but it's
just so I was hoping it being a pump but
it's just a big bottle it's got 5.9
fluid ounces how like a scent I would
have gotten this at the beginning of
this summer
it's not open yet I'm gonna wait until
I'm through with I have a firming lotion
I'm using right now that's like up and
up or Target brand I hate it I thought I
would like it the first few weeks of
using it I did
but I just pulled it back out to kind of
finish it up and I'm not I don't like
the smell I don't I don't know I don't
think it's doing anything so I'm excited
to try that actually
and then they sent the Nerium ad age
defying treatment night cream awesome
formula to improve the appearance of
discoloration aging skin uneven texture
it's paraben free gluten free cruelty
free and dermatologist tested awesome
so oh look at the packaging that is
sleek as heck I'm diggin that for Shep
um apply four to five whoa pumps a
product to face and neck that'll be good
I need I think a better night time thing
as I am getting older I'm not old by any
means you know we gotta take care of
ourselves starting young so I am
actually really I might start trying
that tonight and then this is the day
cream I wonder if the packaging is
similar and I'll have to let you guys
know how I'm liking this after a while
because if I do I want you guys to know
and if I'm not I want you guys to know
but I really have her pretty good things
about Nerium after they contacted me and
I started to kind of do some digging and
look them up you know I can't get it
open
Oh similar but it's like a daytime
bottle that's cute so I'm excited to try
those hopefully they're great and like I
said I'll let you guys know kind of what
I'm thinking about them and then I also
had some more letters this is from ivy
hmm let's see
Oh beautiful like stuff going on oh
that's cute oh whoa Jessica one of your
videos from renomii you were looking for
books yes I am for my classroom it was
always a bit ahead of my class oh my
gosh
Ivy thank you she sent me a $50 Amazon
gift card you have no idea how much of
that is going to help and you know the
reality is now that schools started and
gone to the swing of things I'm you know
I let the kids take the books home with
them but a lot of them don't return them
but I want them to have books at home I
want them to be reading when they're at
home so you know that's kind of the
reality is a lot of them I'll buy or you
guys will send and then I don't see them
again so it's you know this is gonna
help a lot and I can't I could cry I
can't thank you enough because as anyone
that is a teacher or has any type of job
like that where you've had to kind of
supply your own everything
it is incredibly costly oh my gosh so
thank you I mean to the the bottom of my
heart thank you
I really am crying now okay
get it together just emotional okay this
is adorable this is from Amy and this
this envelope is so cute I almost don't
want to open it so you know oh gosh oh
that is so gonna go to Paris so bad oh
she wrote me a really nice she lives
nearby
she knows really close to me oh yes
thank you Amy was just saying that she's
thankful that I'm clean and I don't use
foul language or anything like that and
thank you and I'm kind of the same way I
don't I don't typically watch a lot of
people here on YouTube that do use foul
language and I told my students recently
we were talking about writing and
becoming writers and I said you know
when you're older and you're thinking
about who your audience is and your
writing I said you know it's up to you
what kind of language you want to use
you can use foul language all you want
that's you especially when you're older
and it really is your decision that's
you but as an adult that's the decision
you kind of make and that's the decision
I've made that I don't want I don't know
that's just not me so it is what it is
thank you well hopefully Amy we will run
into each other someday since you live
literally like 10 minutes from me I
don't know if you understand how close
your town is to mine so that's pretty
cool
anyway I think I think that is
everything now I've got a mess here here
here and here I'm so excited to kind of
go through all this stuff and organize
it and get to gather around and bring to
my classroom and thank you to all of you
I I really I feel overwhelmed every time
but in the best way I feel overwhelmed
that I've got all these things waiting
for me to open and how much I mean it
just makes making these videos it's
already worth it because I enjoy it but
it just makes it that much more worth it
because I feel like I'm getting to know
you slowly and my favorite things are
the letters to be completely honest
because it's just nice to hear those
words of encouragement as I'm sure you
would know I mean and I right everyone
back so even if it takes me a little
while I write everyone back so just know
that - thank you so much and I hope this
video is enjoyable for you guys of
course it was long as you jump I'll get
you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
