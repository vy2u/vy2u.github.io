time that the time is right to write to

big like there's no but there's not been
any real big trouble but just a little
negativity that I wasn't used to and I
have felt very blessed on my channel to
all of you guys my subscribers are so
incredibly sweet and you know when there
is negativity it feels like a ton of
bricks it could be two people saying
something really extremely hateful and
it feels like a thousand whereas I could
have a hundred of you guys say something
so wonderfully sweet and it's lovely and
I love reading everything but when two
people write something incredibly mean
and hateful it feels like a thousand
people I don't know how else to describe
that um so thank you what a sweet sweet

Works and it's a limited edition
during the holiday season so once it's
gone like after Christmas it's just gone
okay I'm too hot to wear this right now
this is so cute oh my gosh
so I am so excited because I didn't buy
backups cuz I was like

it go cause it's so cold out so oh my
gosh okay
this is unbelievable okay you guys look
at this wrapping job I just got to keep
showing you you guys are all so talented
okay so the next thing it looks like a
lotion kind of or something like that

have in my purse right now and I don't
want to run out like please let me run
out of that will be so sad the hand
cream is the best thing they sell the
best of vanilla bean Noel
she said you're set for a while on her
card here oh my gosh you guys she bought
me four of my favorite Revlon Colorstay
base coat white it is the best base coat
for nail polish I have ever used and
from what I had heard it's being
discontinued and I found like one at Big
Lots so I bought one and I was like now
for your right I'm set this is so
awesome like this is like the only thing
I would genuinely want backup sub you

decluttered girl it's alright I've been
shopping like I have nothing better to
do right now I'm just in one of those
moods you know so that's all right oh

way too excited about all this oh my
gosh
okay the next thing here Wow oh man so I
can already tell these are hand
sanitizers and I can already see that
two of them are my favorite vanilla bean
Noel and it's even funnier because I
actually keep this in my car so when I
get into my car like after school and
before school etc I have one right there
that I can just kind of sanitize you
know once I just leave that building but
it looks like there's more and some
other come not color wall colors but
since when I go through this stuff like
crazy okay I can't get it out there we
go so there is ski bunny ironic if you
guys have seen my skiing video that
Tyler put on his channel

was the it's hilarious I literally
laughed out loud numerous times watching
it he edits he edits better than I do

look so flippin comfortable and I love
that they're like the comfy they're not
like fitted at the bottom you know how
some of them are scrunching it that

saw the tag um my boyfriend or the
boyfriend tag video which you guys

about he is hilarious and you need to
watch at me if you have it 'inna thank
you she did give me your stuff smart
that's so funny 'inna I'm sure you've
gone through a lifetime of people
pronouncing it wrong just like I did I'm
sorry she was born and raised in the
Dominican Republic she came to the US
for college she graduates in man
Congrats ahead of time oh my gosh she's
23 and majoring in theater performance I
don't know if you remember my comment on
your video yes I do I was wondering if
that was you okay that now it connects
she's always left cooking - awesome
you should blog make cookie videos the
thing is like I feel like with blogging
and with making videos like there's
enough room for everyone here and that's
what's so amazing about something like
the internet that the world can never
have too many bloggers because you find
and read who you want to so it doesn't
matter that there might be a thousand
million bloggers in the world and
YouTube video creators whatever there's
enough room for everyone so why not try
why not start it because what's holding
you back it's free for the most part I
mean unless you get into like crazy it's
free to do and if you enjoy it why not
so what if one person's reading it for
the first while of doing it eventually
you're I just say why not oh
