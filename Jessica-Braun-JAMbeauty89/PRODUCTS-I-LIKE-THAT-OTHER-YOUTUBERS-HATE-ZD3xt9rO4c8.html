gonna share with you products that I
love that other youtubers don't like I
just did the kind of companion video
where it was products that I hate that
other youtubers love but this time is
it's it's ones that I love or actually I
guess I shouldn't say love love some of
them I just really like and other
youtubers don't like and I every time I
see it a video I'm like really well yeah
you know teach their own we all have
different skin and wants and needs and
stuff so it is what it is my classic
phrase it isn't this but I love these
products or really like them so if you
like this kind of video definitely
subscribe before you leave hit that
notification bell so you know when I
upload new videos let's go ahead and get
into it by the way on my lips I'm
wearing the new Gigi Hadid lipstick in
Austin speaking of that one product I
actually quite liked that a lot of
people did not was from the Gigi Hadid
line I actually really like the little
eye contour palette the only gripe I had
with this it's a shadow palette was that
the pans are comically tiny I mean they
really are and frankly the price point
fifteen dollars I think is high but I
actually really like this palette now it
is powdery but I feel like it blends
pretty well and these are totally colors
that are up my alley and I think that's
why I really like it you've got a tap
your brush off or blow it out whatever
you want to do so that way the powders
not getting everywhere but once you do
that I think it blends pretty nicely
this is totally like a travel companion
palette for me because I love these
shades and I use every single one of
them so do I think it's like the most
amazing product in the world no but did
I actually really like it yeah I'm
wearing it today I threw on some of her
shimmers you'll see in that video I'm
trying it on so you get to see it in
action there's some like I don't like
her shimmer shadows I don't think those
are very good but I really I actually
really liked this palette and I feel
like it deserves a little bit more love
and like I said in that video the
swatches don't tell the whole story so I
could swatch something and two swatches
in like that one does but what I'm
actually putting on the eye it looks
really nice and it blends really well so
there you go I'm drinking cold coffee at
this point alright one another product
that other youtubers don't like and like
what is the new Revlon youth effects
fill and blur primer for face and neck I
really liked this stuff
push the bottom and it comes up
literally every time I try to push up
every single time and so it's kind of
like one of those classic pore filling
primers because if you use too much it
can pill up and I think that's why a lot
of youtubers don't like it but for me I
only use it on my nose and I really like
it there because all I'll have on
underneath it is a really thin
moisturizer and then I just put just a
tiny bit there and I feel like it fills
in my pores really nicely I don't use
this all over my face though so I think
if you did always use this all over the
face you probably would see a little bit
more of that killing that can happen
with any product like this even
expensive products like this can do that
so you kind of have to be mindful and
figure out what works but I thought it
was a pretty decent primer and I think
other people like oh my gosh it's
terrible my okay I don't think it's
terrible calm down
but I've been using it now for gosh
probably two months and I actually
really like here's one that I I just
kind of thought I wouldn't like but
other people are kind of giving flack to
now it was sent to me and I'm always
honest with you guys and things are sent
to me if I like it or I don't like it I
don't have any fears that if I'm gonna
be taking off a PR list cuz I can afford
to buy them if I were dying to try them
it's not that big of a deal so it's the
clover palette from Too Faced I'm gonna
be honest this came in the most stupid
packaging it was so wasteful it was like
a pink plastic fire hydrant and of
course I'm appreciative but I'm like
this is so wasteful so you open it and
there's the doggy toy in it now
Pinocchio loves the doggy toy but it's
all about Jerrod Blandino the owner of
to face his dog clover and the colors
together I was like you know don't like
it it's too much for me however I have
fallen in love with some of the shades
in this it doesn't seem to have any sort
of a smell it's a lot to look at but
it's kind of cutesy but I thought it was
gonna be really dumb really kitschy I
love like there's this shade cuteness
overload that is my favorite shadow for
on my lid Chihuahua is like the best
kind of creased and buffer color what
else oh my gosh paw print is like this
kind of purplish mauve fell in love with
that shade though honestly the mattes
don't
watch that well but they look really
nice on the actual eye so here's some
swatch like you these are two of my
favorite shadows and you can't even you
can barely see them and swatch but they
look gorgeous on the eyes so you know
there's enough colors in here that I
like if I could just get rid of like the
bright ones that I know I'm myself I'm
not gonna wear do I think you should go
out and run and buy this mmm maybe not
cuz it is expensive and if you don't
think you're gonna use most these
shadows
you're better off buying maybe the
chocolate bar palette where there's a
lot of these kinds of shades but I
didn't think this was a bad palette so I
just think it was kind of odd I don't
know the names are cute though Chihuahua
paw print I rough you retro cuddle buddy
love is love wet kisses it's really cute
but I don't think you need to run up by
it but I don't think it's a bad palette
does that make sense
next thing that I love the other
youtubers don't like is this Ulta full
coverage liquid concealer this is like
my favorite concealer I've been using it
all month long I'm wearing it today and
I'll even show you me applying it today
with a sponge it's got a sponge tip
applicator it's a really creamy formula
and it just blends so nicely now it does
still crease like every concealer I've
ever used it still creases so I always
set it with the powder of some kind but
it's just a gorgeous gel like concealer
which I love I feel like it stays in
place all day it really does a nice job
covering that area without it looking
dry which is my biggest problem with a
lot of concealers it can make my skin
just look dry and gross this doesn't do
that and I love it for that and I feel
like it's rare to find a concealer like
that for me and so when I did I was like
oh my gosh and it's actually you know
somewhat affordable so like all of these
will be linked below but I absolutely
love this concealer I don't know why
other people don't like it like I like
this better than the sharp the tart
shaped take the sharp tape tape anyway I
like this way better than that another
product now this is expensive so again
I'm not saying you need to run out and
buy it but I'll describe it to you and
you decide if that's something that you
would like it's the g-body photo
perfection fluid foundation they sent me
this a long time ago in like three
shades I am in the shade for perfect
vanilla currently I love this stuff
but I think that people it's tricky
because it's such a high price tag and
you want it to be the most perfect
foundation for me it works really well
with my skin it's moisturizing it's not
glowy but your skin can kind of still
breathe through it but it doesn't have
high coverage it's got like light to
medium I would say maybe medium if you
build it up but I think a lot of people
that like high coverage foundations hate
this stuff because of that reasons they
want a lot more coverage and this just
doesn't provide that but for me it stays
in place all day it just like I feel
like my skin likes it does that make
sense like I've tried a million other
high-end foundations and I'm like hmmm
don't like it but this one I genuinely
like every time I put it on I'm like
it's gonna be a good makeup day and it
always is because it just helps
everything just look so nice together
it's got an SPF of 20 which is funny
that it's photo perfection I don't know
if they're using photo in the sense of
like you know sunlight that kind of like
I'm thinking of photosynthesis do you
guys know I'm saying because I think
with SPF of 20 there might be flashback
with it so it's just kind of a confusing
title but I really really like it again
it's incredibly expensive do you need to
go and buy this no but if you like that
medium coverage and you want a nice like
maybe you have a gift card or something
I really liked it but only if you don't
expect full coverage because it won't
give that to you the last product I
almost didn't mention because I don't
like meshing to face that much because
I'm not a hundred percent sure that I
love this the brand there's a lot of
just weird things that the owners done
and I don't know I've even gone on a
brand trip not a brand trip but like a
gone flew out to an event with them and
it was fun and great but I don't know I
guess I'm still forming my opinions with
brand and Too Faced makes some of my
favorite products like truly this is
something that was also sent to me and
that's why I was like I don't want you
guys to feel like I'm only mentioning
practicing because trust me did I talk
bad about a lot of products that are
said to me but these I thought would be
really bad everyone had said oh these
are terrible I actually kind of liked
them but again like they here's this
bronzer it's there to face bronze peach
it was part of that like peach
collection and it's a cream bronzer but
everyone's like it doesn't really show
up well I agree but if you use like a
sponge and this is how
by every single time and I get a bunch
onto the sponge you can kind of I can
put a little bit more you can kind of
stamp it where you want it and I feel
like it looks so pretty
you've got to really dig in there though
but I think it looks really pretty
really kind of as natural as it can be
and it doesn't make your skin look any
more dry I'll put it up and near the
hairline up here I really like this
stuff and it stays in place pretty well
throughout the day and it does have that
kind of burnt peach smell which I like
but I was impressed and no one else
liked this and I think it was because I
don't know I think either they didn't
know how to use it or maybe they were
doing their finger or maybe they have
darker skin and it just didn't show up
that's the other reality there's only
one shade which you know if you don't
have a maybe lighter skin tone it might
not show up very well although this
watch is actually recently dark but I
don't think it goes on that dark the
other one is their peach frost and this
is like their highlighter the blush I
didn't love I have that but the
highlighter I think is pretty good too
again I do it the same way where I guess
I can put a little bit more on I'll use
the tip for this and I'll do that and
just kind of Pat it on that region and I
actually think that it looks really nice
especially if you're doing like a quick
like no makeup look this is an amazing
way to just throw on some glow on your
face and it looks really pretty and
natural because it's a cream but it's
not like a liquid where you have to be
really careful about where you're
placing it this you can kind of slap on
and it just looks like a healthy glow
that's why I like it really so I was
impressed with these if that sounds like
you'd like it I think it's worth the
money if you don't like cream products
then you're not gonna like them because
you're not used to using it you know
what I mean
but I those I really was impressed with
and I'm so surprised that so many people
bash them so those were all of the
products I wanted to mention today if
you enjoyed this video like I said I
hope you'll give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you want to see the
companion video to this which was the
products I don't like the other
youtubers like I will link that below
