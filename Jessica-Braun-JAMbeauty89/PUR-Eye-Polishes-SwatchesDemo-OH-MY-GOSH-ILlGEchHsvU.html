going to be reviewing and swatching in
demoing these brand-new pure high polish
which is these are $26 I know they're
sold at Ulta and I don't know if it's
sold it's for as well I can leave them
below but I have all six shades that
they recently sent to me and they send
them to me as most companies do for PR
purposes and what that means is they
send them to me and I can do with them
what I want if I want to play with them
and show them to do I can but I don't
have to there's no contract there's no
so this isn't sponsored they're not
honestly I don't even know that they
know that I'm doing this video but I
joined them and I was like oh my gosh
these are stupid amazing so I'm just
like well let me time girl I've been
using them for a couple weeks now and
I'm like I have to show you guys these
because I've been sent a lot of products
I don't show most of what I'm sent but
this was something that I feel strongly
enough that I have to tell you about
them so let's go ahead and get into it
now as I mentioned these are $26 and you
guys know I am a drugstore Queen and I
love the makeup at the drugstore but
I've never tried anything like this and
so you know when there's something out
there that's a brand new thing that I
haven't tried before I feel like it
might be worth the price tags at least
try one because there isn't anything
like this in the drugstore that I know
of and you guys can correct me below
because if there is something in the
drugs like this I want to know about it
so let me know but these are these
little pots and there are six different
shades and to show you the packaging
it's you unscrew the lid and there's
this like little mesh like very kind of
jumpy little it's like a little
trampoline and the product is down below
and it's this cream but it's like a more
of a liquidy cream oh my gosh and there
are these unbelievable metallic shadows
and I they're creamy but they're more
like liquid and cream and they dry to
the to look exactly as they do I feel
like it with a lot of cream shadows when
they dry or you kind of put them on
they blend away and they don't look as
vibrant but these I have on my lid today
it's the most unbelievable thing this is
in the shade satin so what I'm going to
show you first is nice watching all six
of the shades if you just want to see a
certain shade the timestamps are going
to be below but then I'll show you me
applying this to my eyes today and what
they look like and how to apply them
they come in their little box with this
little silicone applicator and it allows
for like a really precise placement of
it but I don't typically use this I use
my finger which I'll show you in the
demo I just think it works better for me
but if you're really conscious of
bacteria then you might want to use this
brush but it allows for really precise
application as I said I also used it to
kind of pop a little bit in my tear duct
area which it was great for so let's go
and get into it
you
okay I know it looked like a scary
caterpillar right now all right so I've
got my favorite shade of this that I'm
going to apply and show you guys how
they work this is in the shade satin and
it's kind of like the pinkish rose gold
one what I do have to do it comes with
this little like plastic applicator that
you can dip because of the sponge there
you can dip into the product but I mean
it's more sanitary to do that but
honestly I just use my fingers which I
know bacteria but that's just what I do
but I do you missed that way it'll get
the product out through the sponge and
there's this little piece right here
that kind of stops it so it doesn't just
fly all throughout but at least it gets
it up into that area so you could use a
brush you could use this little thing if
you want to be sanitary I'm just gonna
use my finger so I can show you guys how
I do this so you just kind of push it
into this little bouncy pad here and you
get the product on and I just like
applying it to my lid you can apply it
all over but I like to put it on first
and under the shadow I'm gonna wear and
sometimes I just wear this alone because
it's so beautiful but you just put it on
and it's so oh my gosh I just love it so
much it catches the light so beautifully
it does not move I'm gonna wipe off the
excess to blend this closed and even
this time okay so you can kind of see
that it's not perfect because I'm going
to apply some shadow around it but it's
so beautiful look at how shiny that is
gonna wipe off the extra
and like I said I mean I could take this
and blend it all the way up but since I
know I'm going to put a crease shade on
with this
I don't want it necessarily all the way
to my brow bone but you absolutely can't
I'm gonna add a little bit more over
here so I can wear it like this with
some liner and mascara but I'm gonna
throw on some shadow as well but I love
this shade I think it is so so beautiful
I was gonna do it without the care when
I figure I'll show you I'm using this
becca little palette it's called their
ombre nudes eye palette and I just love
using these two shades here just for a
simple kind of more matte look
especially since I have such a shimmery
shade on my lids I kind of want to play
that up and I don't want to add a lot to
the rest of our using this second to
lightest whoops this second to lightest
shade here we just with the fluffy brush
and I'm just putting it all over my
crease just kind of a light wash of
color and really I could just stop there
but I'm gonna get this middle shade
right there and I'm gonna just work a
little bit of that it's not really that
dark but just in the outer area of my
crease just to kind of deepen it just a
little bit not much though and then I'm
just gonna take this lightest shade here
and just put it right under my brow bone
nothing too crazy and I'm gonna blend it
here in a second all together I'm gonna
take that original fluffy brush kind of
wipe it off and then just blend now to
show you you can put more of this on top
because that's part of the part of the
way this product is market is that you
can put it along you but under shoutings
but over shadow so I'm gonna put a
little bit back over it just to show you
what it looks like when you do that I'm
just gonna
on the inner part here so beautiful
and it really does like once you put
this on it really does stay put like
it's not going anywhere you can even
take this and put it like in your inner
corner so I'm gonna actually use the
little applicator and just take it right
there you can see how it catches the
light really nicely and again this stuff
doesn't really budge so that's always
nice so I'm gonna put on liner and
mascara and I'll see you in a second so
as you can see these are really a cool
product they're similar to cream
eyeshadows and that you can kind of use
them in the same way but what I like
about these is you can put them like on
top of like whatever shadow you have and
it adds that metallic sheen but you can
just apply it and it dries whereas with
cream shadow I feel like the fire didn't
have a shadow on my eye and then I get
some cream shadow on it's really hard
most of cream shadows can't just be
patted on top you have to like rub it on
and then it's wiping away whatever
shadow you already had on so that's one
way that I think these are kind of
different and interesting but also just
the kind of liquid nature of these I
think is really really cool do I think
this is something you have to have no
but do I think it's something that's
really cool there if you're a makeup
lover like me and you just haven't tried
anything like this they're really really
cool and they stay on all day and I I
think really my favorite shadow is the
one I'm wearing today that I showed you
in the demo satin second favorite is
cashmere it's like this really light
golden the rest of them I haven't played
with enough to decide how much I love
them and how I want to wear them but
they would be beautiful for a smoky eye
you can even put these with the little
silicon thing on your lower lash line
especially the darker ones because they
really stay put and I mean they stay
through a lot I was wearing these when
it was raining outside the other day and
I was kind of drenched and this did not
budge so I was really really impressed
hopefully this review was helpful for
you guys I know this is more of a pricey
product if you're interested in more of
my drugstore reviews I've got lots of
drugstore creme shadow reviews and
things like that I can leave my playlist
below and if you enjoyed I hope you'll
subscribe and stay for more drugstore
makeup videos and I'll catch you
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
