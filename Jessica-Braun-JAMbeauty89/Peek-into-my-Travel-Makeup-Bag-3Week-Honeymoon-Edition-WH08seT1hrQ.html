going to show you what is in my travel
makeup bag this bag I got it severe
about Vera Bradley bag that they sell
here in the Disney parks and at the
resorts and stuff and I bought it the
last time we were here in Disney in
October we go like twice a year it's
awesome anyway but they have a bunch of
different colors and patterns and all of
them have Mickey and Minnie in it in
some way or at least Mickey this one has
like tiny Mickey's here and a big one
here they're just all over the place
some of them have like straight-up
full-on Mickey and Minnie in them which
are really cute too so I'm thinking
about getting a crossbody here of that
but I don't really need it so I don't
know we'll see I don't really need any
of this stuff anyway so I'm gonna show
you what I brought I have bought a lot
of makeup while I was in France on my
honeymoon but I'm not including it in
this cuz I've done those halls and
that's not really what I packed to bring
and I wanted to show you guys that so
let's go ahead and get into it if you're
gonna ask what's on my lips I brought
two lipsticks
well no three lipsticks with me but two
of them are Mac ones and one of them if
I can find it in here is called fire it
up and it's one of their retro matte
ones that are really really drying it's
a really pretty red and it's almost this
exact same shape but it's really really
drying so when I was here I picked up
and this is the only thing I'm gonna
show you that I actually hauled here
this Marc Jacobs one in Oh Miley and
it's the same thing same shade but it's
way more long-lasting and creamy and
super matte still I'll show you the
swatch of it even though you can see it
on my lips cuz it's so so so beautiful
it was so expensive and it was I mean
I've done a lot of splurging on my head
and because it's my honeymoon but this
was one of my favorite splurge as I made
because this is unbelievable so that
being said the other matte lipsticks
that stick that I brought was Please Me
which is like a really nice pink color
and I love it because it is matte but
it's their new formula of matte that are
a lot creamier so I would say if you're
looking at Mac I got that retro matte
one from like a CCO so I don't even know
if they still sell them like on the Mac
website or anything but definitely get
their regular
line the new one cuz they're beautiful
and I love this pink so when I was
thinking about packing lipsticks for
this trip I was like okay I know I want
to read then I know I want a pink and
then I know I want a peach so the peach
one that I brought is a wet and wild one
that I just recently fell in love with
called 903 C just peachy and I've
mentioned this I think I mentioned this
in my favorite but it's such a beautiful
peach color it's again matte a little
bit drying but usually I'll wear this
with the lip gloss that I'll show you in
a second and it works really really well
and honestly they have really good red
lipsticks as well in the wet and wild
line so I would say look there if you're
just wanting a red lip but you know
you're not gonna wear it often that
would be a good option so you're not
spending a lot of money it is still
drying but it's still really really
matte and really really red which is
nice okay
moving forward the rest is gonna be kind
of out of water cuz it's you know and a
makeup bag but I'll give you guys a
little peek inside I don't drop it all
so the only foundation I brought was the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation I'm
wearing the shade in 117 this is too
light for me now that I've gotten a lot
of color like way too light but I love
that it is a yellow tint so during
normal times of year when I don't have
some Sun it's perfect for me and it's
like I said it's got that yellow tint so
it actually matches the rest of my skin
but I've had the bronze up a little bit
my face is still a little bit lighter
but it's what I brought so that's what
I'm stuck with right now
but I really do like it it's not it's
not the most moisturizing foundation so
like right now I've got a lot of
breakouts from putting on sunscreen on
my face because I didn't bring a
foundation with sunscreen I don't know
what I was thinking I've learned a lot
of lessons this trip anyway so I've
broken out a lot and this does not look
great over breakouts in my opinion on my
skin so that's one huge downside I wish
I would have brought I don't know maybe
my Revlon Colorstay whipped although
it's in a giant glass jar and love that
stuff so much I don't know they actually
you know what the Rimmel what's the one
I love wish I would have brought that
one cuz it's amazing okay I also brought
and this was mentioned in my June
favorites my heart candy highlighter and
T key and this is like $8 at Walmart I
don't know the exact price
anyway it's this gorgeous like kind of
golden II highlight but I love it and it
works on there's a mirror here
it works on lighter skin tones which is
so rare in my opinion for a kind of
shimmery gold highlight alright so right
before I had left I got a shipment from
Tarte there PR department sent me a
bunch like all of their blushes I'm
losing my mind all of their blushes and
a few other things so I brought a couple
of them with me and this one is one of
their blushes and flush and it's this
gorgeous kind of blue toned pink it's
almost purplish pink which is one of my
favorite shades of blush these don't
swatch great but they're absolutely
gorgeous something yeah you can't really
see it there but they're so pretty on
the skin I'm wearing them on my cheeks
today I love them they last a pretty
long time some people have said oh yeah
you can get 12 hours out of it like I
wouldn't say 12 hours but I've never met
a blush that lasts that long if you've
got any that you know last that long let
me know below but I also brought their
Park Ave princess bronzer and it's their
matte one that's waterproof and it's
perfect if you have fair skin again I'm
now too dark for it
but regular times of the year this is
incredible and it really does stay put
and it's just so it doesn't look
unnatural it's so hard to find bronzers
and contour shadows like our contour
powders like that it's just amazing okay
I'm like piling this up on my lap let me
put this down I also brought my lorac
Pro palette now this is the only big
powder I brought I bought I brought way
too many shadows that I know but this
one's amazing because it does have the
mat in the shimmery shimmer so I knew I
would have a lot of options and I like
that had a mirror and I actually a few
days I had no way to get ready other
than this so I'd prop it up on like a
cup and have some of my makeup bag
behind it so it'd be open so I could do
my makeup so it was kind of nice to have
that as an option but it really is nice
if you own it it's a great travel
palette I know a lot of
we'll say that it's for good reason it
really does have everything you could
really possibly need now I want to step
further and brought way more
I also brought since it was my honeymoon
I had splurged a while back ago on the
Marc Jacobs Lolita palette which I loved
and honestly I'm wearing it today I've
worn it most days here it's actually
kind of crazy how little I've worn my
lorac Pro palette compared to this
because it just stays put all day now
most shadows do but like like maybe on
the lid if you had a shimmery color kind
of wear off this stuff doesn't move it's
crazy I love it and it blends together
like nothing I've ever used and I love
Urban Decay shadows but nothing's quite
matched up to this it really does blow
my mind so I I love it so much if you're
curious I'm wearing this color on the
lid today this color in the crease it's
kind of a matte that's also in my crease
and then I have this darker black
usually at nighttime when we come back
to kind of refresh in the middle of the
day before we go out for the night I'll
take this black and put it smoke out my
like outer corner and my lower lash line
and then I'll use this like creamy matte
white to just kind of put on my brow
bone on top of my lid as well and just
kind of blend it all together it's
amazing the other shadows I brought I
had taken out of my bigger Mac palette
and just put in a quad I didn't realize
how cheap the quads are for Mac like you
can buy an empty quad that's what I mean
empty quad or an empty little duo one
they're really inexpensive like I don't
remember how much I spent on these but
they're like under $10 maybe five like
it's way cheaper than you think so you
could get a nice Mac palette if it just
makes you feel good I mean that's how I
am like whoo it's a Mac palette but then
you can fill it with elf shadows because
they're amazing as well so I just
thought that was kind of cool to know
that they're really not that expensive
but I brought Omega this is oh a
subscriber sent this to me and what is
the name of the shadow it some shimma
shimma from makeup geek it's amazing
this is another Mac Shadow I can't
remember the name and then this is rice
paper I love I don't wear this one as
much I brought it just in case and it's
why I don't know the name because it
doesn't really it's not a favorite
okay I brought this mac mineralize
skinfinish natural you guys I think it's
either the sunscreen I'm using or this
that's breaking me out and if I look
like on my nose it's because I am
because I use the foundation and I don't
want to put this the only powder I have
and I don't want to put on top of it cuz
I'm breaking out and I think it might be
this because the only places I'm
breaking out which is right here and
here is where I've put this where as I
put sunscreen everywhere so I don't know
so I haven't been using this which I
feels like an oil slick but that's okay
because I think this is it but I have it
in medium it's nice it doesn't keep you
mat for that long and it might be
breaking me out so I just don't even
know I brought my favorite chapstick the
seal Bigelow my favorite night balm I
talk about all the time because it's
amazing
I brought OPCON a allergy eyedrops cuz
my allergies have bothered me everywhere
we went in France they were driving me
crazy it was so bizarre I also brought
this NARS concealer in vanilla I'm
pretty sure it out like I'm running out
of all my favorite makeups because
makeups just I have on because I'm using
them a lot it's nice I don't think it's
worth the splurge you guys I've never
noticed that huge of a difference
between this and the one I did a dupe
for anyone know what it is it's the NYX
HD one they're the same like I don't I
don't know if I'm gonna repurchase this
cuz it's nice but it's nothing better
than a lot of the drugstore once I've
tried so my opinion um I also brought
this chela ivory lace highlighter I
bought on HauteLook for like five
dollars originally a lot more it's just
that like brow bone highlight color you
know and it really is nice and it blends
well if you just draw it up there and
then I haven't really used it much this
trip though because I can just use a
shadow so I think when I pack next time
I need to be I definitely need to pack
less I know that and I'm so mad at
myself cuz I'm usually a good Packer but
I knew we'd be checking bags because
there was free checked bags on all the
flights we had so I was like well if I'm
checking a bag I brought way too much
but usually we don't and so I'm a really
light packer the other concealer I
brought was the tarte maracuja
creaseless concealer I wear this on my
wedding and yes the video is still
coming I'm gonna wait till I get home
it's really nice I'm wearing
today it's it stays in place it covers
really well but it it kind of makes your
fingers messy that's the only thing so
like you get it and you kind of do this
and then pat it where you want then I
use a brush or a Beauty Blender to kind
of blend it in and it just is messy but
other than that it really is amazing and
I would say it's a little bit thicker
than the glamoflage one that I like a
lot too this one's just a little bit
thicker in my opinion
okay so timers back there getting ready
if you see a light on I also brought to
go with my concealer my everyday
minerals powder like to kind of set it
and it's in their shade multi-tasking i
buy this on Vitacost for a little bit
cheaper than it is it's still kind of
pricey for what it is but it's amazing I
like it better than my bare minerals
it's just brighter and it stays put
longer and I've even used this in other
spots on my face as well once I realized
I think the Mac one was breaking me out
I was using this here and it still works
I don't think it stays put all day so if
you're like wanting to leave and not
have to touch up and you wanted it to be
as flawless as when you first put it on
it's not going to be but I really really
really like it
a product I've hit pan on and I taught
Tyler what hit pan means because he
heard me to fall in the bathroom the
other day while I was getting ready he's
like what and I was like I hit pan on my
favorite contour my favorite bronzer and
he was like what does that mean is that
a good thing or a bad thing or like a
bad thing well it's a good thing but
about thing because it shows that you're
using it but it's bad because this is
really expensive this is the Kevin of
Kwan sculpting powder a medium and it's
just that perfect gray tone it stays put
it blends beautifully I mean there's a
reason that makeup artists love this and
that Ray goes like me love it I mean
it's amazing for like all skin tones
unless you're a lot darker in which case
you would need naturally you would need
something darker but it really is
incredible and when I run out I this is
one I already know I'm going to
repurchase it's worth the money every
time I got two mascaras now one that I
brought is the it cosmetics tightline
mascara that you guys know I love that
has that tiny tiny tiny tiny wand
just to kind of literally do your tight
line and its really good for lower
lashes
but I'm pretty sure it's completely out
now and then I brought my voluminous
waterproof turns out the waterproof
formula is totally different than the
regular you guys I hate this like I've
been trying to make this work for weeks
and weeks and weeks I hate it so much
but I knew I wanted waterproof since
it's hot and I knew I wouldn't be able
to touch up too much
I don't like it doesn't hold the curl
the way the regular one does which you
think waterproof and hold it better but
in my opinion it doesn't I just don't
like it it makes me so sad so I can't
wait to get home and get my regular one
and I wish I would have brought it okay
so for my brows I brought my uh Nastasia
brow pencil and medium brown I just love
it it's easy and it's quick and it
matches in my opinion the way that I
like my brows to look I love it that
I've literally this is like the fifth
one I bought and it's always worth it to
go with that I brought the Anastasio
clear brow gel just cuz I had one it
does work really well but the next one's
pretty good too for liner I've been
doing like a triple-decker when it comes
to my eyes which is what I typically do
anyway I've been using this Stila smudge
stick waterproof liner I have a bunch of
these that I've gotten like us free
gifts when you do orders online you know
like on Ulta or wherever and this one I
got with something in this in the shade
damsel which is actually a dark brown
but it works perfectly for just kind of
tight lining and getting your waterline
and it stays put and then on top of that
I'll use my L'Oreal lacquer liner which
is like a gel or cream liner to get it
really thick and nice and so it really
States but this stuff does not move and
then join us to top it all off in to
clean up the wing I'll use the Stila
stay all day waterproof liquid liner and
it's just an intense black and it's just
you know a pen format it's fantastic I
wore it on my wedding day it is amazing
I love it so much speaking of cleaning
up the wing I also brought my ELF makeup
remover pen you guys know I bought like
a thousand of these three bucks you can
get them at Target
wherever sells elf also online just to
clean up your wing it is incredible
and also like you know if you've got
really long lashes or whatever and you
get the little dots up here this you
know you can almost dot it away and then
blend with a brush and it's good as new
okay I also brought this one Paint Pot
it's the only cream shadow I brought I
ended up buying one if you've seen the
video but this one I brought with me
it's Mac vintage selection the one I had
bought in Paris was the benefit Croesus
cream shadow in RSVP which is very very
similar to this this one's kind of like
this golden champagne with a little bit
maybe more like a rose gold but it's
more champagne II than rose gold and I
loved that about I think is so beautiful
I just love those colors and this looks
great on its own when you don't want to
do any other eyeshadow you can just wear
this and it looks absolutely gorgeous I
also brought my Too Faced shadow
insurance this is awesome I realized
though again in the interest of saving
space that could have brought I had like
a sample one but I was throwing it you
gotta understand when I was packing my
makeup it was literally the day after
our wedding and we were flying out but
we had to go to a breakfast first with
family so like literally I was just
getting ready that morning and putting
stuff in but in retrospect I should have
grabbed the smaller version of this just
to save a little tiny bit of space it's
fantastic there are a ton of good eye
primers though so I don't think you have
to get this expensive one elf has great
ones but I do love this I brought in the
interest of skincare and it's all worn
down there elf zip eraser which actually
it's got a higher concentration of
salicylic acid versus they're like
rollerball version which I used to love
I mean I still like this one's just a
higher percentage so when you're using
it you twist it up and it gets the
solution into the little brush and then
you can brush it on wherever you're
breaking out I'm breaking out a ton but
it does really help kind of kill them
before they become worse so I love this
stuff it has been a life saver saver
this trip alright the rest of the stuff
I have is lip stuff now I brought two I
brought more than one I wonder where the
other one is well then I brought three
see I shouldn't rubble
these this is max soar which is really
big right now it's kind of a dusty but a
little bit darker purpley mauve and it's
good but I should have maybe not brought
this and brought this this one's my
favorite
it's the Rimmel exaggerate lip liner in
East End snob and it's this gorgeous
pinky I loved it so much and it's so
creamy but it works so I should have
just brought that and the other one I
brought I'm assuming it's lost in my bag
is actually one I should have used today
it's more red tone and it's Mac's lip
liner in beat B eet like the food the
vegetable and it's great for red lips
especially if it's more like this where
it's not where it's a little more cool
tone and not necessarily like orange e
red beet is perfect however I will say
about the Mac lip liners they are a
little bit drying so I don't like I
would rather have the Rimmel one and I
might look when I get home at the Rimmel
line and see if there's a really nice
cool tone red one and if you know let me
know because I love that formula and I
like I like the formula better than the
Mac formula so I brought one more
lipstick I completely forgot this is the
Urban Decay lipstick the revolution
lipstick and native and when I think
about like see I shouldn't have brought
this because it's so similar to please
me there but this is native and I love
it these are this is very very very very
very creamy it's so lovely one of the
best form is this is just like the Marc
Jacobs formula I love them but I should
have brought both Pink's that's again
what I'm learning and then I know that's
a hair tie I also brought my Rimmel stay
glossy lip gloss these are becoming my
favorite lip gloss I brought two of
these but again the other one must be
lost in my bag but this one's in
blushing Belle graves that I love and
it's kind of a how you described it the
first time I showed it in a video as
like a gray pink because that's what it
kind of looks like to me kind of a muggy
gray pink I love it so much it is so
beautiful on its own it's so beautiful
just over lip liner it's beautiful over
lipstick like anything you can imagine
this is gorgeous the other one I draw is
the more peachy shade let me see if I
can find it found it this one's a
non-stop glamour and this is the one I
we're over top of that wet and wild
peach one and it's just this gorgeous
peach but it's there all shimmery and
they're beautiful and they wear away
nicely and they just feel good on your
lips if you were to get two of them from
their line I recommend these two
non-stop glamour and blushing Milgram's
these are under five dollars from what I
remember and they are incredible I love
them so much so now that i've swatched
my hand away that is everything that I
brought with me unless it's lost in my
bag I don't know about it but if you
have any questions about what I brought
or any suggestions for what I should
bring for my next trip please let me
know down below and also if you're
interested in the makeup that I did buy
while I was in Paris and elsewhere
definitely check out my past videos on
those I can link them below I did a
European drugstore makeup haul and then
I also did like a Sephora high-end haul
in Paris so I'll definitely leave those
below as well as my June favorites and I
will catch you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
