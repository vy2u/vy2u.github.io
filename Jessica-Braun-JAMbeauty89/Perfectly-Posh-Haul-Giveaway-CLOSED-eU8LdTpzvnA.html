kind of hall / unboxing video for you
guys so I had someone named Jessica name
twin contact me and she is an
entrepreneur whatever you call it for
perfectly posh and I had never heard of
it but it sounds like it's kind of an
umbrella company kind of like mary kay
is where you own your own mary kay
business if you will and you sell the
products so you can have like posh or
whatever they're called parties and
things like that but I feel like
everyone's heard of it I've never heard
of it so I was really excited and it's
kind of like bath and um body products
and so she sent me some goodies and I
haven't really looked in but she also
said she included some give away things
so if you're interested in the giveaway
and you'll find out and I will find out
here in a bit what will be included in
the giveaway I'll put instructions on
how to enter below if you are interested
she did say that she would have kind of
like a jam Beauty 89 the sale bash or
whatever and so if you click the link to
her little sale for this if you order
anything that I mentioned or that she
sent me in the video and you click the
link you can get a free gift with
whatever order you place so I think that
was really cool no she's not paying me
anything it's not sponsored I just think
this is fun and she sent them to me so I
figured I would show it so let's again I
can't wait um so the first thing at the
top is this mfeo mint for each other
cute but mint m int rosemary peppermint
ooh and it's a big bath bar yes this
chunk may require both hands that is
awesome you can kind of already smell it
it is minty which I love and I'm
assuming this is kind of like a bath
bomb or is it like a bubble bar it says
where have you been all my life true
love with our finest meld uber
moisturizing in deep cleansing soap
chunks so it is like a soap shea butter
peppermint and rosemary leaves will be
together forever this is adorable so
definitely going to be using that the
next thing in here says caddy coral is
that what is it candide lip die and so I
ok so the
shade is caddy coral these paths is
packaging it's also like vintage and
retro it's so cute oh it's like a little
pot of lip I guess lip balm set slip die
which is a little scary doesn't really
seem it says apply lip die thickly to
lips with fingers or brush leave Matt or
finish with eyes sparkle gloss which I'm
assuming is a gloss they so it's I mean
there's no like it looks like it should
be that color but I guess it's more of a
sheer but it says leave Matt so I'm
wondering if it like kind of it's like a
stain sorry if my hair looks crazy you
guys know the drill it's just all right
so we got a big old bag of things now
I'm seeing this is incredible so there's
another candy lip die and this one is in
the shade dog darling can you guys tell
them in a silly mood ok so this is much
darker darling I'm looking back on my
orange one and it hasn't stain so I
don't really know what this dye thing
this one has some more color to it
though you know because it's dog darling
that's pretty ma'am oh it smells good
like berries yes did the other one have
a smell I need a baby wipe no no one
doesn't relieve a small but the darker
one hat smells like berries like really
really good got my frozen baby wipes
that i got from big lots for two dollars
but Olaf is on them so that is a win the
next thing in here is this it says BFF
best face ever exfoliating daily face
wash that might be nice it says gentle
one hundred percent vegan blends no soy
or gluten no parabens or sulfates no
dyes or that phthalates natural
fragrances and essential oils a
nourishing base holds millions of
exfoliating microbeads it's gentle
enough for every day with the naturally
cleansing blend of essential oils that
is nice I'm wondering if it has like a
if it has like a smell oh it's closed I
can fix that what does it smells kind of
minty in a way cool so I probably will
use that I love that is
a lot of those harsh ingredients so that
is very nice the next thing it says the
vitamin C fairy radiant face serum wand
just smooth to magical drops onto clean
face and neck each day oh cute it's like
a little dropper it's plastic bottle
which I kind of like if I wanted to
travel with it it says it attracts and
holds moisture while increasing
microcirculation to energize skin hi
stable vitamin C to reverse the effects
of UV damage and inhibit pigment
production protection production move
and it says it lets skin breathe easy
and clean helps repair damage done so
this is sounds really nice and I
actually don't use vitamin C in my
skincare regiment and I really think I
should help get rid of some
discoloration oh it smells so citrusy
which I'm hoping it's not with like fake
fragrances but it sounds like this
company's pretty good about not using
you know created fragrance okay this oh
this one comes with a separate little
thing it says I've been set up
nourishing makeup setting missed I can't
believe I've never heard of this brand
and it certainly seems popular mean
everything seems very well-made well
packaged like it's not like a small
company so it's got like a screw top lid
at first and then you you there's the
sprayer thing send makeup and refresh
crenn skin with a spritz of this bio
nutrient loaded missed chocolate
peppermint hydrosol in nourishing
extracts hydrate and revive spritz over
face and neck I want to smell this
sucker mmm everything seems minty other
than like that vitamin C thinks so
that's interesting but I will certainly
try that whoa this says appeal to me
snarky bar what does it do it's a citrus
zest and Shea loaded very scrubby bar so
i'm assuming it's like it's exfoliating
bar more than just a wash it's a soapy
snarky Shea citrus and loofah scrub
moisturizing your next shower with
aggressive exfoliation and a fabulous
fragrance
you can smell it through it smells
really good and you can tell it's like
gritty this is so cool this might be the
first thing I try I'm excited about that
it's just different okay I think the
last thing in this little bag is who
says wakey wakey all not all natural I
pop and skin stick smack sleepiness
headaches and lifelessness so what do
you do highest awake essential what what
do you do with it though man it's like a
kind of oops it smells good it reminds
me of like the you know the elf
moisturizing stick where you'll grab
some and you just like put it anywhere
you feel like you've got like crepeiness
or dryness it reminds me of that I had
no idea if that's what it is but or
maybe it's just something it's like an
essential oil that you smell to energize
you I don't know if you guys know what
this is let me know i just used it in
many different ways and I'm probably
just like ruined my skin I'm doing it
but very cool and the last things in
here one of these is for the giveaway
and the other is for me she wrote on
this so I'm assuming they're like the
same thing give or take but the one she
said is for me is this little baggie
full of like little samples which you
guys know I'll probably travel with
these things i'm traveling a lot over
the next few months to a lot of
different places um so there's the big
fat yummy hand cream in lil snarky some
more of the exfoliating daily face wash
that is awesome for travel especially if
I like it the walk on the beach pedicure
grade san scrub so I'm assuming it's
four feet skin delicious castaway
coconut scrumptious coconut oil body
butter very cool what else we got
apricots overnight a rich face mask for
moisture and then a gender bender
because pure clean doesn't discriminate
it's I think it's one of those chunks
but it says it's a detox oak chunks so
that's pretty cool good send the entire
could share like if I brought it on our
honeymoon to Europe to travel with and
then another yummy hand cream the it
girl what I would probably do with these
is you know
finals like the hand creams if I'm going
to use them at home I would just buy
like a little travel container and just
squeeze it into there and then I can use
it that way so I don't have to worry
about keeping it in the thing so she's
got a whole other bag of I think the
exact same products it looks like they
are exactly the same in this baggie for
the giveaway and I'm going to throw in
this soap because I've got to I know
these are different but I've got two of
them and I figure it's going to take me
a while to go through one so I'm going
to keep this one but I'm going to give
away this one because I want whoever to
win to win even more because i think
these are really really cool so if you
are interested in the giveaway
definitely check below for info on how
to enter and of course check below for
the link to go to the jam beauty bash or
whatever cute names she called it was so
cute i remember if you're interested in
checking these products out and perhaps
buying some but thank you to Jessica
sending these to me these are really
cool and I'm excited to get to know
another brand that I've never heard of
