going to share with you a huge pixie
haul so pixie is sold at Target stores
and that's where I found these and I
actually going to include it in a
dresser haul I get ready with me that I
did today but I have so much pixie stuff
and so much to the other stuff as well I
was like I've got to slip it somewhere
and since I bought enough pixie stuff
for a haul I thought we will do that
separate so that's what we're doing
today so there's so much stuff that's
recently come out some duo's with
different youtubers influencers people
in the industry and some of them are so
good so let's go ahead and get into it
I've used probably about half of this
stuff and the other half I haven't used
so it really is kind of a half haul half
review kind of a video so the one thing
I've used I actually use today is this
highlighter it's the pixie and Espinal
bard again I'm not sure if I'm saying
that right but it's there glowy powder
in London luster and it's this gorgeous
white gold highlighter but it packs such
a punch this is diffused on my face and
I feel like it's still so beautiful I
mean it's crazy pigmented perfectly
glowy not glittery but really shimmery I
was so impressed and it's one of the
first highlighters I felt this way about
that when I used it I was like oh my
gosh like it takes your breath away so
highly recommended it stays in place all
day it's just so beautiful now if you've
got much deeper skin than me this might
be almost too much it depends on what
your taste is the highlighter what you
like what you don't like okay so the
next product is one that I haven't
actually used on my face yet for the
honest it kind of intimidates me and
it's the pixie natural contour powder in
shape and shadow I mean this is like a
true contour like dark gray very very
pigmented very buttery
let's see kind of how it blends it looks
like it would blend pretty well and
definitely create that kind of a shadow
you have to use a light hand with it
though because holy moly but I love the
green packaging like looking at all this
pixie stuff sitting here it just makes
my
are happy anyway so I haven't used it
very intrigued I like how sleek the
packaging is and it's a like a pitch
they used to do like packaging that like
would kind of like the NARS packaging
where it would really show dirt and
fingerprints but now they have like this
glossy look and so it doesn't and I love
that there are not many true contour
powders in the drugstore so that was
really exciting now keeping in mind that
pixie is drugstore but it really is more
expensive I would consider it kind of
in-between it's not truly drugstore even
though it's sold at Target but it's not
like a luxury high-end it's right in
between price-wise the quality wise most
of the things I tried are really good so
the next thing I got was one I heard
someone here on YouTube talking about
now is what sounds pretty awesome
it's the pixie and Carolyn Caroline
Huron I've never heard of these people I
feel like left out like who are these
amazing people making these amazing
products I know a lot of you guys
probably know who they are and you're
like mad at me for not knowing I just
don't know why we're saying it everyone
that does YouTube and different things
they're double cleanse so half of it is
a solid cleansing oil and the other half
is a cleansing cream now I have been so
into cleansing oil type things most
especially like the it cosmetics one or
I'm using the elf like melting gel
cleanser where you get a little bit of
it and you kind of rub it all over your
face and it's kind of more like a gel or
like a thicker gel and it just gets your
makeup off then I go in with a cleanser
and it's so much better for dry skin
because I think a lot of makeup removers
just rip my skin but those are kind of
moisturizing as they remove your makeup
it's amazing so I don't know oh yes it's
like be it cosmetics so it does kind of
like turn into a bomb but you can get a
chunk out oh I'm so excited and then the
cleansing creams over here these have
absolutely no scent at all which again I
love because fragrance can be irritating
for some skin types so so excited to
give this a try it is totally up my
alley the kind of thing I use every
single night so the next thing I got was
kind of an interesting product it is
their quick fix powder translucid is
what it's called and so it's got this
mirror on top which is kind of odd but
you opened
I got to be careful you put you just
pull it up and there's this puff here
and when you puff it power comes out you
guys see that so it's a white
translucent powder it's a little it's
like a lot of white but I figure if
you're trying to like kind of half-baked
quickly like that's a really quick way
to do that where it's not super obvious
but then you can just wipe it away so if
you're not trying to truly bake but
you're just kind of happy doing it I
feel like this would be good for that
because again it doesn't kick up a lot
but you guys get the idea so it's a
really cool idea the powders in the
bottom you have to be careful because
when you unscrew it the whole thing
comes off so you just put that on so
it's an interesting idea and again it's
called the quick fix so it is a quicker
alternative I don't think that's
something I would use every morning
getting ready but when I'm in a hurry or
just on the go this would be perfect the
next thing I picked up is something that
people have been recommending for ever
and finally trying it and this is the
pixie correction concentrate and
brightening peach and it's truly a peach
concealer but it's really more of a
color correcting concealer it's really
peach like it'd be dark for my skin but
it would cancel out those blue tones and
then I could put something maybe on top
of it to make it match my skin tone a
little bit better it's very creamy it
reminds me of the consistency of the
Benefit Cosmetics erase paste I almost
could not remember the name almost could
not anyway but it definitely is a
different color the erase paste is
similar I want to say that one's a
little bit lighter and I think they have
a couple shades regardless it seems
really nice so I also got this eyeshadow
palette it has six shades it's they're
mesmerizing mineral palette in copper
peach and it just seems so appropriate
for summer know spring I wish it were
summer the shape of the shadows reminds
me of this G washy shadow where they're
like exactly the same except for this
palette is horrible it's their
shimmering news palette horrible this is
really really pigmented I've only used
this once
and I was really impressed
the shadows staying on all day the
swatches aren't really doing it justice
I'll do it close-up of swatches here but
the shimmers are really really pretty
they're easy to work with they're not
too much like they're certainly not as
pigmented as like I don't know like The
Naked palette but these are actually
wearable so they're pigmented enough to
look really good but they're not so
pigmented that you get kind of
intimidated by them and you're not sure
you know what I'm saying only thing I
wish this palette also had was like a
medium tannish brownish color to blend
it all together I feel like that's
missing but everything else is gorgeous
so the next thing I got was this h2o
skin tint it's their tinted face show
this guy has not tried let me do it on
this hand I got the shade number one
cream and I think it would be a pretty
good shade for me I feel a little light
well I don't know but it's a very thin
like all goes away it's a really weird
consistency I mean it feels like water
when I'm doing this it's really weird
it's not thin like a serum foundation
it's thin in a very different way I
think this is meant to be more like a
tinted moisturizer not necessarily as
something that's going to provide
coverage it might provide like this much
coverage but I thought for those days
when I'm just I don't know maybe running
to the post office and doing some little
errands and I want to look a little
better than just me rolling out of bed
this would be nice so again I'll have to
try it out let you guys know okay so I
got some things I'm really excited about
one that I was kind of disappointed in
let's start with a disappoint let's
start with the ones I was actually
excited about so I bought these
eyeliners from pixie and I bought three
of them they have their I define water
line and it's a black liner retractable
not as thin as like my hourglass 1.5
millimeter that I love but this one is
just as creamy and it stays just as well
as that in the wire length up here if
you don't care about it being super thin
you just want it to stay in the
waterline to be really black and budge
proof then you can save some money and
get this pixie one it is so black and
you put it in the waterline it does not
move in fact it might say a little bit
better than the hourglass one often
maybe chargin side by
I don't know but they're both so good
but this one really blew me away
and then I bought these eye brightening
pencils again they're retractable same
packaging as the other one this is the
eye bright liner and it's like this nude
cream I mean you're not really gonna be
able see it because it's almost
perfectly blends in but again it's
really creamy it's nice to go in your
lower waterline to make your eyes look
bigger but today what I use is the extra
eye bright liner and this one is a
little bit more white almost pinkish so
I have it currently on my waterline down
here I don't think this stays like all
day but I do think it does brighten the
area it's not fake looking which I
really like because when I've used like
a stark white there it just looks so
fake like it might look okay in a video
but in real life I'm like to know like I
don't want I don't know I don't like
that look in person so I might do it
from time to time videos although I
can't even remember time that I have
maybe a long time ago regardless these
are actually wearable so they don't look
weird they actually just make you look
like you don't have red inner rims so it
looks very natural but brightened does
that make sense I think it does so very
impressed with these really all of their
liners are amazing and it's just
something different looking in your
makeup bag then just I feel like
everything is always black I think this
is so fun then I got the one that I was
kind of disappointed by this was their
cat eye ink and it's of course an
intense black and it has this kind of
angled edge it just wasn't very black
it's a liquid liner but it's kind of
inky and very inconsistent
it's black-ish but not super black it's
just really inconsistent so I just
wasn't impressed with this I've tried it
like four different times I've sorted
different ways you know China because
I've had this stuff for probably a
little over a week I don't know I'll
maybe try it out a few more times but it
I wouldn't say go run out and buy it buy
anything so though overall the pixie
products that I bought if you're
interested in seeing all the other stuff
on this side of the table there's a
bunch of drugstore stuff that I use to
get ready today I will link that video
that is up below if it is not then
and stay tuned because it will be up
very soon and it's a lot of goodies and
some things that were absolutely
terrible so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
