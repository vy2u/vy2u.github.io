hey everyone is Jessica and today i have
a new subscription box to unbox for you
guys today so this is I've heard of this
box it's the popsugar must have box I've
heard of it from a lot of people here on
YouTube but I never received one and
they just sent me one to review yes they
sent it to me complimentary but you guys
know I'm always honest with you guys
whether I think it's worth it or not so
this box is 3995 a month which is a lot
more than the typical subscription boxes
i'm thinking of you know starlooks is
like ten dollars boxy charm is more
expensive that one's what 21 right but I
love that one and it's got all high-end
so this is a lot more expensive than
though so that's one thing to keep in
mind but I'm really excited because it
isn't just makeup it's typically just
like all kinds of different things so
I'm really excited to open it so here we
go let's see it's certainly heavy it
says surprise love and joy I'm hill
thank you very much okay so the first
thing I'm seeing is this card it says
October 2014 yes um says what inspired
us for October tricks and treats cat
eyes moonlight getting cozy pumpkin
spice yes well me too oh it shows
everything it's in there I'm already
accepted i just accidentally saw
something okay so the first thing I'm
seeing is oh and this is the thing I saw
it said happy socks and I'm already
excited it's a look it looks like
they've got like a I don't know is that
called leopard print pattern or whatever
but it's black gray and red and they
feel really soft and thick really good
boot socks these are so cute it says
they're combed cotton whatever that is
they're cute I'm excited to be all cozy
okay so that's awesome then actually I'm
seeing pumpkin spice montval by Dean &amp;amp;
Deluca which I have heard of interesting
pardon me what's right now but I'm not a
big malt ball fan so maybe I might pass
these on to someone in my family or
someone that I know that will like these
cuz I mean mumbles are okay but I know
it's just not I'd rather have a resi any
day let's be real okay oh my gosh these
are adorable so this is nail art
stickers but it's all like Halloween
themed there's a little jack-o'-lantern
face in spite
webs that are so cute the brand is
nailed kit is that yeah is the brand
made with love in San Francisco it's so
cute I probably will use those this week
ok the next thing I'm seeing ooh is this
like a soap I'm assuming says cayhall
designs yeah it's a soap shea butter
olive oil triple milled I guess the
brand is studio hall and it just says
shoreline so I don't know if that's like
the scent or whatever you got it's just
a big old bar soap I don't really use
bar soap much but maybe I will
especially if it's really nice and good
for your skin especially as we're going
into the colder months and so if it's
really moisturizing which I would assume
it is with shea butter and olive oil I
might just use this yeah well maybe I'll
branch off this month oh ok the next
thing there's a lot in here ok is oh
it's a butter london week I pencil I
have not tried any of the butter london
like makeup or anything it looks like
it's like a steel gray colored like a
silver says Earl Grey huh can I get it
off oh yeah it's like a smoky charcoal
gray I mean that's kind of that would be
a really good lower lashline color by
the way today I did my makeup without
any actual liner like I just use shadow
eyeshadow and I don't do that very often
like really like ever i always use some
sort of like pencil liner or liquid
liner or cream liner but this is the
first day at least on video that i've
done it with just a shadow no not do you
guys ever do I don't know maybe I'm just
weird maybe most people do I don't know
anyway this is judah I like that a lot
actually i don't think i have like a
gray eyeliner at all ok this is a plain
box it feels heavy though oh oh it's
like a picture frame like a glass little
cube interesting the brand is Isaac
Jacobs oh that's cool it magnet or wait
yeah it magnetizes together so that
makes it easy to switch out I might
bring this into my classroom and use it
or maybe I'll use it in here I like that
a lot actually
cool your helmet I bet that was
expensive it feels really well made okay
so the last thing in here is also heavy
but it's oh it smells like some soy
message ceramic candle what's the brand
mine I think is the brand certainly has
a strong smell oh okay it's a chopper Oh
cute it's a chalkboard candle so you can
write on it huh and it comes with chalk
that is actually really cute the smell
is very like fresh clean like lemon but
mixed with soap I don't know it's like
lemony so p-type citrusy smell I'm
obviously really good at describing that
actually it's kind of dead on so
whatever but it means smell science it's
certainly a clean i would this is a
smell and i think of more for like
spring but i might just save it till
then that way I've got especially since
it has this nice little box here but
that's cute so you can tell I mean what
I'm gathering for this is that this is a
box that it's just all kinds of you know
we did get some makeup we got that liner
but you know you got some candy you got
some socks you got a picture frame a
candle what else so so it's kind of a
fun mix I like it it reminds me of the
fancy box you know where it's just kind
of a smattering of things you might get
makeup and jewelry but you also might
get all kinds of other things so i think
it was fun forty dollars is a lot though
so you know if these are things that
you're like you know I don't really none
of that is useful to me then this might
be a box that you might want to pass on
if you're all about makeup and you
really don't want anything else then I'm
obviously this probably isn't the box
for you but if you like getting random
little goodies then this is perfect
especially if you're like me where you I
mean obviously I have a lot of makeup
yes this is one of my jobs in one of my
favorite hobbies but you know I have a
lot of makeup and the last thing I need
is more makeup so this is kind of a nice
option for those that feel like all
right I think I've got enough makeup I'm
good then this is I think it's just fun
and I like that it's themed it's all
fall you know you got cozy socks you got
moisturizing soap and um you know a warm
canned although even though it smells
like spring you know whatever pumpkin
spice mult Falls anyway okay
mom I really liked it but let me know
what you guys think below if you've
gotten past popsugar must have boxes let
me know some of your favorite things
you've gotten and I'll catch you guys
very soon bye
