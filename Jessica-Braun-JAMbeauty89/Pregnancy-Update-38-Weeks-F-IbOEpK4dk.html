time I'm filming this I'm like 37 and a
half weeks I'm like three days from
being 38 weeks so I might just title
this 38 weeks I don't know I always
stare I'm like I'm not gonna title at 37
and a half weeks and by the time it's up
and you're actually seeing it I'm
definitely gonna be 38 weeks but just
kind of wanted to update you I think the
last time I updated was like 34 weeks
and I meant to do it every two weeks
well here we are four weeks later so I
don't know if I'll do another update
like this style update of my pregnancy
and symptoms and things just if you're
watching cuz you're around the same time
or you're just curious or trying to see
like in my eyes what I'm going through
normal that's how I feel too and that's
why I watched these videos as well so I
hope you maybe get some comfort or some
insight from this video or maybe you're
just curious and you just want to know
how it's all going so like I said I'm
gonna reapply my lip product while I'm
talking this is oh my gosh this is the
YSL the left liquid color bomb I just
hauled it for a Sephora haul that I just
filmed and it's so comfortable and I was
really looking for something like I need
a comfortable lip product that I don't
really need a mirror for it's kind of
sheer ish but it's like really thin and
like moisturizing it's not like a gloss
it's it's great okay Jessica this is not
that's not what this videos about
alright so 38 weeks basically whoa we've
had an interesting past few weeks which
is why I hadn't posted one of these
video is one of these updates because we
were kind of waiting on some results of
some stuff so it's been an emotional few
weeks so if you want to know about my
early on issues that I had in pregnancy
I will link my other updates and my very
first one is where I talked about I had
a sub chorionic hemorrhage which is
basically a bleed and we thought maybe
was miscarriage thank goodness it wasn't
although for a lot of people it does
lead to that so that was really scary
early on like I want to say I was like
12 ish weeks along and then hence I was
on bed rest for like a week or two there
which was interesting and then just
boring is what I mean by that anyway but
I'm so glad that everything was fine and
then we
some issues with if you like just all
kinds of little things and that's the
thing and that's something I've even
talked to my dad about you know as I've
shared these kind of things with my
parents too because you know they want
to know my dad's like you know with all
the technology we have today with
ultrasounds and all that we can see and
find out ahead of time it really does
lead to a lot of worry and in some cases
it's worried that it's warranted and
that you it's something maybe you can
fix or change something to help you know
the pregnancy go better but then a lot
of it you know in the end ends up being
an unnecessary worry like oh they
thought they saw something on our
ultrasound but actually it was fine and
so it really is like it's it stinks
because we're in an amazing age where we
can find out so much but then some of
the time we're worrying about something
that in the end isn't actually a problem
so that leads me to what kind of the
update is but before I get into the new
things that are kind of going on with
this pregnancy I figured I'd share kind
of my what's going on like symptom wise
if you're just curious so kind of at
that point where I'm still uncomfortable
trying to fall asleep and even once I
fall asleep I wake up really easily
which is abnormal for me usually I'm
like a deep sleeper and what used to be
one trip to the bathroom is now two
trips to the bathroom in the middle of
the night and I've heard people say you
know it's just kind of preparing you for
being up every three hours to feed and
like that's probably true maybe it is
maybe it is preparing my body for that
weird interrupted sleep cycles you know
and I know I know still I'm getting away
more sleep now than I will be here in a
few weeks so hope holy crap it's only a
few weeks away that's so scary so that's
one thing that you know it kind of comes
with the territory you're just
uncomfortable um another thing is she's
certainly moving a lot which is good but
you know you can feel how a she's
already dropped a little bit and when
they've done some research or sounds
like wow she's really low like your head
it's already kind of in the birth canal
kind of air I mean I don't know if it's
that low but I mean she's really low I
don't like does that mean I'm going to
labor quicker they're like no I'm like
no dance anyway so no you need to keep
growing in there little one but that
being said I am kind of in that mode
where I'm like all right like I'm ready
I'm ready for her Tyler my husband's
like okay we're ready like let's get
this pregnancy over with he keeps saying
I want my wife back you're crazy him
like I know totally crazy anyway um so
that's just uncomfortable and I think
that's part of why I need to go to the
bathroom all the time again is that you
know she is bearing down on that and
she's lower and you know they get lower
as you get closer typically to your date
but but her kicks are just like really
you know they're strong now and it's not
like little flutters now it's like you
can see it you know visually you can see
her kicking and pushing and she moves a
lot at night for me so when I'm trying
to fall asleep I'm already uncomfortable
and then she's doing all that so but
eventually I fall asleep so I have been
drinking a little bit more pregnancy tea
raspberry leaf tea I had no appetite for
it the first two trimesters even early
on in the third I was like tea sounds
disgusting to me and that's crazy
because I love tea like I would drink it
every day at least a cup sometimes more
than one and all kinds of tea green tea
white tea black tea is okay me I don't
love it but anyway that aside I finally
am kind of like okay and so I've been
drinking a little more of that with a
little bit of honey
although I keep reading like is honey
safe too it says on the honey bottle
it's like don't feed to infants under
one I'm like why would I be giving honey
to infants under one anyway if anyone
can give me insight into that I'm
interested is I have to do with like
allergies and beep ha I'm so curious so
give me some insight down there curious
anyway um so that is good cuz I feel
like that's good you know raspberry leaf
is great for pregnant women and you
pregnancy tea that usually has raspberry
leaf and then a couple other things that
can help with labor can help with
breastfeeding all kinds of different
things so I think that's great my feet
it's funny because I my feet are tired
by the end of the day especially when
I've been out and up and about but like
my sister was telling me we were up on
our feet like a lot of the day and they
kept saying go sit down
all right and so I'd sit down for a
while then I'd get back up and do stuff
and my sisters like Jessica seriously
your feet are swollen and I look down at
that I'm like no not I'm looking I'm
like I don't see that there's much they
trust me there I'm like what I still
don't see it but she was like cleared
she's had like five kids she's like no
those are so long for you like okay but
I think it's one of the things that I
don't like when I picture Shawn feet I
picture really swollen feet but she's
like no it's like just a little bit
squishier than normal I'm like yeah I
guess so I think I am having slightly
swollen feet feet but it's not all the
time it's only when I've really been up
on my feet cuz I know when you're
earlier on in the early 30s it's
worrisome if you're you've got that bad
is swelling cuz it could be signs of
preterm labour preeclampsia I mean
there's all kinds of things so at this
point 38 weeks it's it's so often on
really that's kind of the only time I
notice it but certainly just pain from
walking and doing all that I haven't
been working I was really good about
doing like lunges and stuff a few weeks
ago I've not been very good about it
lately I'm just my body's tired and I
know that it's it can still be good like
I've heard that lunges not lunges what
am I thinking of squats are really good
for you know your label labour muscles
and stuff I'm like when I'm like
thinking about doing I'm like oh my gosh
it sounds terrible so I can't decide you
like maybe that's my body telling me no
Jessica you you're don't you need to
rest or maybe it's like no I need to
fight through that so that's something
I'm just kind of grappling with I'm so
close at this point which again is still
crazy symptoms aside I have packed my
hospital bag officially and I will do a
video of what's in my hospital bag soon
and I'm waiting at Tyler's gonna pack
his bag because he's planning on staying
at the hospital and with us so we did do
our child birth and breastfeeding and
labor and delivery classes
Oh newborn care classes as well and so
we got to practice changing diapers and
swaddling turns out I'm terrible at
swaddling terrible I need to watch some
YouTube videos practice with a baby doll
terrible at it
Charlie was actually pretty good at and
he was he got to practice changing a
diaper and I even snuck I took a picture
of him at the class and put it on the
screen right now
so cute oh my gosh it was like melting
my heart the whole time but learning
about breastfeeding I'm like me and this
is what I needed to know because I'm
like I how do you know what to do but a
lot of it is so natural but then there
are those parts where it's like making
sure the latch is just right I was so
nervous I'm like you know what Jessica
they're gonna be lactation consultants
there they can help you with that
they'll make sure that the babies you
know not latched weird where it's gonna
end up causing you know pain over time
things like that so it definitely eased
my nerves about that because I'm
thinking how do you learn like I don't
have a baby to practice what that would
be very weird you know what I mean I
don't have a real baby to practice with
right now and until you've done it once
you just don't know so it made me feel
better kind of seeing that in saying
okay I kind of have an idea and then
they'll be there to help me because I
just you don't know what you don't know
and that's I mean that's true with
anything in life and then the labor and
delivery classes it was nice we took it
at the hospital we're delivering at and
so like in the world of pain management
when you'd look on like any blog online
or any baby app it's like oh there are
all these different medicines and
they'll name like ten different ones and
it's like how do it what and then of
course there's the epidural and then
some of them do nitrous oxide like
laughing gas and so it was nice to take
the class at the hospital I'm delivering
because the nurse could tell us exactly
what our options are so that was really
nice to say okay now I know like this is
truly I only have three options which do
you want to try or none of them you know
so my what I think I've decided to give
a try is the nitrous oxide they say can
just help but my doctor kind of told me
she's like you know I haven't had a
patient use the nitrous oxide and then
just give birth without any other pain
management
she said it always ends up just being
kind of a gateway to whatever the next
step is whether they decide to go with
like an actual like new bein the pain
medicine they give it my hospital or the
epidural so I'm like well then do I even
mess with it I mean it doesn't harm me
it doesn't harm the baby I don't know so
that's something I'm kind of toying
around with I don't really care either
way
but I was so set on the epidural but as
I've learned more about how it really
does slow down labor for most people
like by hours and hours and hours then
I'm like I don't know but I'm like see
this is something that I have not
felt the pain before so I just don't
know how I will manage it so I think I'm
just gonna I'm kind of open is what I've
told my doctor I'm very open I'm open to
trying the new Bane I'm open to trying
the epidural I just kind of want to wait
and see and see how my how I deal with
the pain in those moments and decide
from there because it's it's easy for me
to say oh I don't need the epidural
right now on the other side of it what I
haven't felt what it feels like so and
my family's very split like some of my
family has sent epidurals and loved it
and like my friends and then some of
them are like no no I've never done that
you don't need to so it's like we're
just gonna see what happens I will
update you after with what I decided to
do so into the kind of issues the newer
issues that again might not be as she's
in the end so couple things we went to
get an ultrasound because they were
worried about the baby's growth which is
why I ended up kind of taking in these
last few weeks of work off because I was
gonna keep working for another few weeks
to be like one week from my due date I'm
really glad in the end I'm taking off
these last few weeks just to kind of
rest to get things ready here because as
a teacher you're on your feet
27 kits it's a lot it's a lot of energy
or expending I'm tired just being at
home doing housework right now it's
exhausting maybe at work these last
weeks I am amazed if you worked until
your due date and you were on your feet
most of the time kudos to you I couldn't
do it anyway so they were checking on
the baby's growth at the ultrasound and
we've had so many this time because of
all the issues you've had so they're
checking on at the Rec you know I think
she's okay well a day later and my
doctor's office called me and my doctor
looked over them a little closer and
said you know we want you to do an
ultrasound at this other place where
they have even more technology really
make sure the baby's growth is okay at
this point okay
so Tyler and I go the next day to this
other place where it's even clearer
imaging and you know it's just different
technology and in the end they realize
oh actually the baby's okay she's at
like six I think she said she's pretty
sure it's like 6 pounds 2 ounces which
at 37 weeks when we got it done is
pretty good she's like so really I don't
think the size will be an issue in life
awesome that's wonderful I mean that was
like answers to prayers so that was
great but she said but I am noticing
some anomalies I want the doctor last so
that
this other doctor comes in and this is
where I said it's been an emotional week
so he came in and he said you have you
ever had an ultrasound before you were
pregnant like no I don't know no I
hadn't and he said well we noticed that
the shape of your uterus you have what's
called a septum kind of like the you
know where your gums meet just
connective tissue muscle whatever that
it kind of makes your uterus like shaped
almost like a heart and he said the
problem is because you're pregnant in
your uterus is expanded it's hard to
tell how truly how big that septum is
because obviously the baby's doing fine
but if it were earlier on in your
pregnancy and we caught this we would
have been concerned with miscarriage and
we would have been concerned with
preterm labor but at this point I'm
almost to terms so they're like well it
the baby would be fine at this point
most likely so he said so that's
something that once you have had this
baby talk to your you know your OB about
looking into this and seeing you know is
this something that's gonna be a problem
for future kids cuz that was my first
question I'm like is this gonna affect
having more children
you know so he said something you know
you just need to find out how big it
actually is back when your uterus is
back to its normal much smaller size so
that's something that you know I can
worry about all I want but there's
nothing I can do about it right now and
the baby's doing fine so the other
concern was that the baby's heart and I
can't remember what it was the exact
part of the heart he mentioned one of
you guys will probably name it and I'll
be like that's it
but he said basically a part of the
heart that you know connects out this is
terrible I know I'm a fifth grade
teacher I don't have to teach the parts
of the heart but anyway part of it that
typically comes out around the trachea
in the front in her it appears as if
it's going around the back and he didn't
seem that concerned as he was telling us
this and of course I'm thinking so what
do we do you know like the heartbeat all
along has been fine for the baby so he
said well in again this was actually at
the hospital we're delivering at he said
though it's in your files he said but
make sure if you need to remind them you
might want to remind him just in case
that they need to do a fetal
echocardiogram ECG
KGB CG anyway um while you're there in
the hospital after giving labor and
births and stuff like that that way they
can check the heart make sure there's
nothing that needs to be done while
she's there if they if you need to do
some checkups over time as she's growing
in that department and so I'm like well
it does make me feel better that you
know he doesn't seem that concern that
they can check it while we're there make
sure everything's okay cuz you know
obviously your heart is working fine but
if that's gonna affect things as she
gets older that would be my concern too
so anyway those are the kind of things
that were getting me really emotional
but when I talk to my mom she told me
she's like oh I actually I have a
heart-shaped uterus I'm like oh and my
mom had six kids so I'm like oh and
actually after her first kid it's a
whole saga her first kid was born at
like six and a half months and didn't
survive and it was so sad so then when
she had my older brother and my sisters
than me and my younger brother but when
they had that baby and they had that
issue they're pretty sure that's why the
baby was born so early because of that
hardship uterus and the doctor back then
you know back in the early 70s told her
you're probably not gonna be able to
having more kids and she had six more
kids so it does make me feel a little
bit better like okay obviously this is
something hereditary that we have and it
was possible for her to have more kids
so it's it's not that it's ruled out in
mine but it just makes you nervous you
know when it's something about your body
you didn't know was there it's like it's
almost freaky cuz you go through your
whole life with no big medical issue if
you do like I've gone through my life
with no big medical issues nothing and
so as you find out more about your inner
body
it's just freaky to learn about so
regardless all is well with her she will
be fine but I appreciate any positive
prayers vibes anything you want to send
my way I certainly appreciate I'm so
nervous to give birth this little
dingdong but I know I know that in the
moment you'll just you do what you do
and people have had babies for thousands
of years as everyone says and somehow
you get through it so but it doesn't
take away the nerves so hospital bags
pack nurseries pretty much done and I
I'm planning on showing you the nursery
as well always nervous to do nursery
tours because any that I've watched
everyone so
Jetix like i know this needs to be moved
once the baby can crawl and I know and
I'm like because you know that so many
people are gonna be in the comments like
um you can't have that shelf there it's
gonna fall on her face or it's like okay
I know just let me just show you my
nursery please please anyway so that's
kind of one reason I'm like do I really
want to show the nursery but I really I
want to share with you guys cuz I know a
lot of you guys are interested in it's
just been fun working on so so I hope
that you've enjoyed these updates
who knows maybe I will have time to do
another update if I ended up going like
over past my due date then I might be
able to do a 40 week update and let you
know how things are going so I hope you
enjoyed I hope you'll stay tuned for
those other videos I've mentioned that
are coming up and I'll see you guys in
my next one I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
