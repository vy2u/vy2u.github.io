video I've never done before this is a
video called products that I hate that
everyone loves like its products that
people on YouTube have been talking
about and I don't get I've tried and
tried and I don't understand why people
like them so most of these are hyped up
products that I just can't get behind I
don't get it
so let's go and get into it I wanted to
do this video because I'd seen quite a
few youtubers do it I saw live loves her
makeup do it most recently and that's
what kind of spurred this so I will link
her video below but let's start with a
foundation I don't know why people like
it's the Urban Decay Naked Skin
weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup I can't figure out how to apply
this I've had two shades
I bought these they weren't PR anything
like that and I it's like it's very
liquidy which is fine but I've tried
applying it all the ways I tried sponge
brush fingers I can't get it to work
on my skin like I don't know what I
don't know what I could possibly be
doing wrong that I've got many
foundations in my life I love and this
one like everyone's like oh I love it
and I'm like why like it doesn't have a
lot of coverage I feel like it just
wipes around my face and never actually
stays put no matter what primer I use it
with so if you have any recommendations
I'll take them because I'm gonna keep it
and keep trying but so many people just
swear by this stuff and I really don't
get it and people say this is their Holy
Grail like I wish I could understand
that love but I don't next thing is
gonna shock a few of you it's a freaking
tart shape tape now this I will say is
not a product they hate so this is one
of the few that like I like it I use it
but people that are swearing that it
doesn't crease how I like what are you
doing differently I've watched like
seven tutorials of some of my favorite
youtubers using this and I'm like
waiting for decrease I'm like why does
it crease on me what's wrong with my
eyes I've never found a conceal doesn't
crease whether I but you guys see like
my wings here I just got this I didn't
wash it that's probably mistake number
I know some of you guys are black but it
looks like I've got like freakin like a
like I'm an evil witch with like I do
you guys know what I'm saying like a
caller it kind of looks cool but maybe
I'll put that so it doesn't drive you
nuts the whole time I don't know anyway
um so I just feel like it's a standard
concealer I don't think it's bad like I
said I do like it I will use it up what
I buy it again I don't know but I don't
I guess I don't get like the internet
freaking shut down about this concealer
you know what I mean like and that I
don't think it deserves I think like for
example holy moley one of my favorite
concealers I recently discovered is this
Ulta full coverage liquid concealer this
is amazing it still creases a little bit
but it creases a lot less has high
coverage it's gorgeous and brightening
and it is so much cheaper so I guess for
that reason I'm like I just don't get
why it's Holy Grail status I think it's
good but I don't think it's that
life-changing the next thing I hear
another youtuber talk about these so a
bunch of youtubers got the milk makeup
lip colors in PR like the whole line and
all of a sudden all these youtubers were
saying oh my gosh and I'm wearing this
milk makeup lip color I love it I'm not
saying they don't love it and that
they're lying that's not what I'm saying
however it is a little fishy because
these are terrible they're they're like
oh they're so creamy no they're not
they're like dry and they like drag now
they're pigmented I mean I guess see I
still wouldn't consider this creamy cuz
I feel like it feels like a rose aren't
kranj to me a little creamier than that
but like I feel like I have to like pull
on my lips to really get it filled in
and then it just looks dry around the
edge so I lip lime which is fine but
then they look all dry and cracked they
feel dry and cracked after like an hour
and I'm like I don't know I don't get it
I feel like they feel like a drugstore
lipstick that's how they feel and there
are better drugstore lipsticks out there
for half the price the Revlon Super
Lustrous are better than these like
these feel like a Rimmel lipstick and
I'm not a big fan of room that's exactly
what these feel like they're kind of dry
not like the moisturizing Rimmel line
but like the standard one that's how
these feel I don't get the hype I don't
get why people are swearing by these and
saying there's
they there they feel like a crayon to me
I don't like them at all and I don't
mean a lip crayon I mean like an actual
crayon crayon and the packaging gets
incredibly dirty because of the lid
having to let go in with the bowl I
don't like it
next thing I'm not a big fan of the MAC
lipsticks all of them but really just
their standard line like they're statins
they're cream whatever I don't know what
all their names are like this is the
shade Twix I actually really like it but
it's kind of that same thing where I
never feel like these lipsticks ever
look good after like an hour they always
look dry and crumbly no matter which
version it is and so I'm like they keep
sending me these in PR and I'll go
through and keep like right now at one
point I had like I'm not joking you like
60 MAC lipsticks and I kept like four or
five because I'm like hey I'm never
gonna use these B I don't even really
like the formula so I hope this doesn't
come across I'm not being ungrateful I'm
incredibly grateful to be able to try
all these products especially when
they're set to me for free but I also
feel like you I have to be honest with
you when there is something I don't like
because that's my job so it's not me
being ungrateful it's me just wanting
you to know my feelings on them and you
know and for review purposes if that
makes sense
so I just feel like they're drying
they're not great across the board and
yeah I think there are some amazing
shades that look beautiful but I feel
like I have to reapply them every 45
minutes because they just start to look
crumbly and gross just saying next
product that I don't know it's the wet
and wild mega glow highlighting powders
all of them I've had them all this is in
precious petals again wet wild sent this
to me it's a pretty highlighter it's not
that it's bad it's kind of that it just
looks kind of cheap on the skin and I
don't know like I feel like a lot of
people latch on and I get it when
there's a drugstore highlight that's so
cheap you know this is probably around
five dollars when there's the drugstore
highlight that's so cheap
I feel like youtubers latch onto it and
talk it up because we want to be able to
give you affordable options it's not
like it's our duty to find 60 dollar
highlighters that are amazing of course
not we're wanting to find these amazing
bargains and while I do think this is a
nice highlight for the drugstore it is
do I think it's this amazing as some
people are making it out to be no I mean
at the end of the day it's a five-dollar
highlight that's pretty nice but it's
not as nice this other one so I guess
it's not me saying it's bad and I'm not
trying to be snobby you guys know I love
drugstore high I think they're Milani
ones I love there are plenty that I love
but I think because this is wet and wild
and because it's at a five dollar price
point people were like it's the best
Tyler I've ever tried am i is it really
though I don't know and maybe it is for
you but for me every time I've worn it
any of the shades I just felt like it
looked kind of cheap and not great and
so that's why I kind of felt like and I
feel like people are kind of hyping it
up just because it's cheaper I don't
think that's right because I would hope
that you guys would want to be informed
of truly the best things out there not
just the best for five dollars and of
course some of us that is our price
budget and I get that too but I think
even at five dollars like the Milani
ones are maybe a couple dollars more but
they're so much better alright next
thing and for a while I thought I liked
this I don't know if they reformulate it
or what but this is a terrible lip liner
this is the Milani color statement lip
liner in nude I was wearing this
actually when I was filming my life
support via I'm wearing this but it
started to like run out and like not
actually line my lips like I don't know
how to describe it like it just didn't
stay in place and that is a lip liners
job the lip liners job is to line lips
keep everything within the lines and
stay in place so that you have a crisp
line around your lips duh this does not
do that it starts to kind of fan out and
like I literally was wearing it for 45
minutes while filming that's it and I
just and I was wearing like a it was
like a Burberry like lip something but
it was a matte it dried down it was
matte so that wasn't moving it was just
the lip liner was just like inching out
it looked messy around the edge and I
was like what in the world and I've
noticed that every time I've used this
so this is like people's cult favorite
and again maybe they redid the formula
or something but it's I don't like it at
all
next thing that a lot of people are
talking about is the Too Faced melted
matte lip colors these were from the I
want candy collection this shade I was
wearing sweet and sour is a Gore just
shade absolutely stunning I'm wearing in
a video and I love the shade but I just
feel like the formula is incredibly
drying cracky after like 10 minutes of
wearing it and I've heard a lot of
youtubers I love and trust talk about
this and I'm like what like it it's it
looks amazing when you first put it on
it does but it's 5 to 10 minutes later
it looks terrible it just you can see
that line around the middle it just
looks dry and cracki and I'm just like
there are better late like the old
friend liquid lipsticks are better if
you I don't know and maybe it's because
I'm I myself personally I'm just like
kind of moving on format' live I'm just
kind of over it
these just you know I loved the shades
but I just feel like the formula is just
that classic dry matte thing that I'm
just done with I'm done with treating my
lips like that it doesn't look great it
looks good for 45 minutes or it looks
good from far away but I'm just done
with it next thing is this bourgeois
bronzing powder this is the second time
I bought this when I've gone to Europe I
bought my first one in Paris I ended up
getting rid of it because I didn't
really love it
then I bought it again I think in like
Dublin thinking oh maybe I just don't
remember it just looks so patchy on my
skin it can look okay in a swatch but no
matter what I do to apply it no matter
what brush whatever it always looks
patchy it never applies like in that
creamy not creamy but you know where it
kind of looks more seamless it never
looks that way so then I have to kind of
clean it up and I'm just like why am I
even giving myself the work I just don't
think it's that great I have two
drugstore primers I can recommend to you
this is the essence Sun Club matte
bronzing powder I think this is really
nice and a lot less patchy do I think
this is a perfect bronzer no but I think
it's less patchy than this
bourgeois one but this ultimatte bronzer
is beautiful I have it in the shade warm
I think they only have like one or two
shades but this stuff is gorgeous it's I
want to say between 10 to 12 dollars I
can like both of these below but these
are what I'd recommend over this so
those are all of the products that I
kind of feel like are overhyped and in
my opinion I don't think they're worth
the hype I don't really like them
like I said some of these products
aren't 100% terrible and I know we all
have our own differ
feelings towards things and ways we like
our face skin lips whatever to look so
that does make a difference in how you
feel about something so like I said I'm
not trying to say that other youtubers
that like this are lying they're not
it's just that I think sometimes hype
can be hype and there's not always a lot
behind that and so I hope you guys know
that on my channel I'm always trying to
be as absolutely honest as I can be with
products without trying to sound like
I'm bashing so obviously this was a
little bit more negative and I'm not
always this negative but either way I
hope that you enjoyed it if you enjoyed
it definitely check out Liv's video
below because hers totally inspired me
and if you enjoyed these kinds of videos
I hope you'll subscribe and give it a
thumbs up and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
