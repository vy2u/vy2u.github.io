a video of products that no matter how
much I declutter and how good I am at
decluttering I do think I'm good at it
these products I just can't seem to get
rid of regardless of how I feel about
them so these are products that I don't
necessarily hate but I don't necessarily
love but I there's something about them
whether it's the brand or what I've
heard about them
whatever that I just can't get myself to
actually declutter them
I saw Andrea Mott Solano talk about this
or do this video on YouTube I will like
hers below I don't know if other people
have also done it but I loved her video
and I love the idea behind it so I
figured I would give it a try as well
and if you're interested in finding out
the products that have kind of a
stranglehold on me then let's go ahead
and get into it I think this is such a
fun idea
okay sorry this is a true true messy bun
so we're just gonna have to deal let's
start with this NARS product this is the
NARS translucent crystal light
reflecting setting powder I bought this
because everyone on YouTube is talking
about it I just don't use it
like there's no reason why I think I'm
confused about how to use it because I'm
like I thought it was maybe more for
under eyes so that's how I've been using
it and I do like it that way it's a
little bit brightening really really
finely milled powder really really
friendly milk um but when I do it all
over the face it's it's fine there's
nothing wrong with it but I just never
reach for it I always reach for my Laura
Mercier one and I don't wear loose
powder every day either so that's
another part of it so with that in mind
I'm like there's no reason to keep it
but there's also no reason to get rid of
it because it's good and because it's
NARS and because it's just one of those
products that people have talked about
for so long I'm like I can't get rid of
it like I like having it in my
collection even though I very rarely use
it so it continues to stay and it will
continue to stay but this just kind of
reminds me that I really need to use it
but yeah just one of those products next
one is from Becca this is the Becca
under-eye brightening corrector I think
I've even talked about this as a regret
and yet I still can't get rid of it I
don't know if it's a mixture
the packaging like it's got this
gorgeous like rose gold pink packaging
it's such an emollient it is a really
really creamy under-eye corrector it
really is but I can never get it to stay
the way I needed to say to actually
brighten it's almost too emollient I and
so for me I'm like oh I'll try it again
and then every time I tried I'm like
yeah but I keep I want to keep in my
collection I love seeing it in there and
every once awhile I'll try it again so
if you have any tricks with this cuz
this is some people's Holy Grail and I
want to love it so badly but please let
me know what how do you apply it like
what kind of skin type do you have what
kind of under eyes you have maybe it's
just not right for my under eyes um
regardless I just can't get rid of it ha
the next thing I just can't get rid of
is the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette it's
specifically the Naked 3 because the
naked 1 &amp;amp; 2 I really love and use the
Naked 3 when I bought it I thought oh
these are such pretty you know kind of
pinkish colors very rosy tone palette
but it just doesn't seem to quite live
up to the same standard as the other two
do and I don't know if they change the
formula it's not a bad palette it's just
not quite the quality I always expect
from Urban Decay and a lot of times the
look just kind of looks the same no
matter what shadows I'm using and I
don't even really love the look it ends
up coming up with does that make sense
so for that reason I never reach for it
but I can't get rid of it I'm like well
I have to make it one and two like I
feel like I should just have the whole
collection naked one two and three and
you know the smokey I didn't really care
like I didn't even try I just I knew it
wasn't really up my alley and then the
naked heat I ended up passing on to a
good friend because I just I used it and
I was like I like it but it's not my
favorite and again there was nothing
wrong with it I just knew I wouldn't use
it very much I had no problem getting
rid of that one but this one has a
stranglehold on me I just can't get rid
of it it's such pretty packaging
probably the prettiest of all three I
love the colors and I love having the
complete collection I just need to I
guess force myself to use it but it's
just one of those things I just I love
having it in my clutch it's terrible
trust me
this is not lost on me the fact that
this is like completely condoning like
keeping things you don't need and I love
to cluttering but I know that I'm not
alone especially like watching ondrea's
video I'm like we are not alone and
having these products that you just you
love and you can't get rid of but you
don't actually love does that we alright
next one is from hourglass this is the
ambient metallic strobe lighting palette
there's nothing really wrong with this
except for it's just a little too much
for me the shadows are shadows the
powders are gorgeous gosh didn't even
see a swatch I really do need to use
this more often I think I always see it
and I think oh it's gonna be glittery
but it's really not it really is a
finely milled shimmer
I just never reach for something oh yeah
strobing glitter no thanks but now even
just watching it it's reminding me that
no just these actually are really pretty
so this is one that I always grab all my
other highlights instead of this like I
just never reach for it and for this one
I guess there really isn't any reason so
I just need to pull this out and try it
more often next one he's a little dirty
this is from gloss a it's there
perfecting skin tint then I went through
a phase where I tried lots of glossy and
products I loved a lot of them some of
them or so so this is one that I kind of
liked when I was first trying it but the
problem is it's such a thin thin
consistency and it never quite makes my
skin look exactly the way I want it to
it doesn't have a lot of coverage it's
not really meant to but I just never
want to go through the work of putting
you on because I know that when I put
this on I'm gonna need a lot more
coverage all over my face anyway and so
I just never find myself reaching for it
but it's not a terrible product it's
just you have to be using it for the
right reason it's like if you generally
just want a little bit of coverage like
a little bit then that's what you can
use it for but other than that I mean
that's about all its gonna do so it's a
very very natural look I just need to
reach for more but I can't get rid of it
because it's one of those that I feel
like so many people talk about I'm like
I like having it in my collection that's
kind of the theme of the video the next
one's from urban decay it's their naked
skin weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup I have it in the shade
one it's not a bad shade for me I don't
know what it is about this I don't
every time you say I just don't like it
why I don't know I I feel like it's been
a while since I've used it though so I
feel like I should give it another try
but this is the one that has like pretty
high coverage right and I know this is
like Holy Grail status for so many
youtubers that I love and totally trust
their opinion but it's like I haven't
found a good way to apply it and I feel
like I've tried every way so if you know
of like a secret to this or maybe a
great primer that works wonderful with
it please let me know because I don't
want to get rid of it it's too nice of a
foundation and it's a pretty good shade
match and I bought this one with my own
money so I want it to work for me you
know a lot actually one two three I
think all of these revolve my own money
except for the hourglass palette
anyway um so yeah that's kind of my
reasoning on this I just haven't fallen
in love with it but I need to know what
are you guys as secrets and my last one
is again from hourglass this is their
veil mineral primer I actually really
like this primer but I have like 40
primers and I'm not even exaggerating it
might even be higher than that oh my
gosh it might even be higher than that
but I like it but it has to be like in
the middle of summer for this to work
for me like I'm not joking it's got to
be like the middle dead heat of summer
for this to work on my skin because
otherwise I feel like it's very
smoothing and I do feel like it fills in
pores very very beautifully and it holds
on a foundation beautifully and that's
why I really do like it and I do
recommend it but I think if you're my
skin type where you tend to be dry
especially in the winter I feel like it
just doesn't look nice on those dry
areas so I end up not reaching for it
because I always think of that and I'm
like it's such a cult classic I'm like I
can't get rid of it and again there's no
reason to get rid of it other than the
fact that I know that I'm really not
reaching for it that's kind of the case
for all of these I just know that I
don't reach for it but it's one that
yeah it's just more of a summer time
primer for me so those are all of these
products I feel like I could probably
talk say this about so many others but I
kind of had to like cut it somewhere
else I would just talk about tons of
parts of my collection if you enjoyed
this kind of fun video let me know by
giving it a thumbs up I hope that you'll
subscribe
and catch more of mine and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
