video but I'm probably uploading these
on different days so if you're wondering
why I look the same that is because I am
the same okay so these are ten products
that I would not repurchase and that I
regret buying okay oh and you know how
that is I mean you you work hard you
make money you spend it and you try and
spend it wisely on things that you need
or things that you know you've heard
great things about that you really want
to try things like that and so first
things first this is the okay well this
is from Dollar General but any of these
nail polish removers that are in these
things I've tried a few and you know you
stick your finger in it and you swirl it
around and it gets the nail polish off
but the thing about it is after like two
uses it's so dirty and you know it's
great that you can you know pour your
own nail polish remover in it if it runs
out but except for the sponge like wears
out in like two uses and if you've got
glitter polish on forget it and I knew
that it wouldn't work that well but I
mean not even close
so I ended up using just the same amount
of like cotton cotton rounds and things
like that to remove it so it's not just
the Dollar General brand in my opinion
I've tried like four or five brands and
they're all the same and you know
they're not expensive it's not like I
always said time money but still it was
a waste of time and effort as well so I
don't recommend these just get your
normal old cotton rounds and some nail
polish remover and go to town because
it's just not it's just not worth it I'm
not gonna repurchase anything like that
again I need to learn from my mistakes
okay another thing is the elf stipple
brush they I haven't seen these in
stores but they sell them online and
this I like this small stippling brush
which I have but this one is like I
don't know I used to use it to put on
foundation before I got like my Sigma
brushes and it's just - it's not I don't
know how to describe it it's not as
dense as I would like it for what I
would use it for
I'm sure but have great other uses I've
tried to use it for cream blush but the
small stippling brush I actually like
better it's a lot denser it's just a
little bit smaller these only go for
like three dollars so again not a ton of
waste
if you add all these things together
that's a lot of wasted money so um I
just don't really like it I think it's
not it feels soft but it doesn't perform
as well as I hoped it would
okay another thing speaking of cream
blushes this is the Revlon Photoready
cream blush they have like three shades
I think they still have them out but I
think they came out last year this is in
the shade coral reef and it looks like a
bright orange but and of course when you
swatch it like this you know but it
wears off in like an hour and I I've
tried to apply with my fingers it never
looks right
so I usually will use some sort of
stippling brush and it looks good like
the first hour but then after that it's
just gone and I've heard you know yeah
you can set it with a powder blush but
then I'm like well what's the point I
want you know I think it's like if I'm
setting ones powder blush I'll just put
on a powder blush that I know stays on
all day so I I don't just don't see the
point in it and so if you have any good
recommendations for cream blushes that
you'd like please recommend them down
below because I want to try some more
but I haven't had much luck frankly so
yeah this is the relevant odor ready and
like I said this is in the shade coral
reef okay another thing and this is one
that was came highly recommended by so
many people here on YouTube and in real
life but this is the NYC smooth skin
bronzer and it's in the shade sunny
people just call it you know NYC sunny
bronzer but you know it's real cheap
packaging this is only two three dollars
and real cute there's like a Sun in it
but it's just too dark for me period I
mean it works well it it lasts as long
as you want it to really but it's just
too dark for me it looks orange on my
skin I think for people with I don't
know you know with darker skin tones it
would look better or maybe with people
that just aren't nearly as fair as I am
it would look nice but I always look
like an oompa loompa with it so next and
I've already mentioned this before in an
earlier video the elf cream eyeliner I
was disappointed in again it was only
three dollars but it's just a little bit
more creamy than I would like
creamier than I would like and I've
recommended the Maybelline gel eyeliner
that they have and also the L'Oreal one
I love both of those they last all day I
have the L'Oreal one on today
and I use that in my tutorial and this
one it just didn't do it for me
I just don't like it I wish I could
return it okay another thing this is the
SE disappearing trip and it's like a gel
that you apply to your cuticles it's for
your cuticles to get rid of them and you
know you can push them back just to
remove the cuticle if you will and I
don't know I noticed my cuticles are
worse after using this like it might
look alright for like a day but after
that that my cuticles are like crazy
after that it's like it'll push him back
and not actually get rid of them
although they seem gone but then like
two days later my cuticles are out of
control so like I just don't like it it
was like seven or eight dollars and I
don't know I keep using it thinking I'm
it's gonna work and then it never does
and my cuticles are worse for the wear
so I don't like it don't recommend it
okay another thing
now this isn't that I didn't like it but
that okay this is the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion and I don't like
this packaging I know they have other
packaging now and this is actually the
one that came with my Naked palette that
I mentioned in my last video the
products that I would reckon that I love
but it's just that it's not worth the
money I mean these can go for pretty
expensive you can usually get them for
free alongside other products which is
nice but if you it's not worth paying
for there's an elf eyelid primer that
they have that I love and it's a dollar
in it I swear to you it's the exact same
formula it performs exactly the same I
mean it's the same I mean there might be
a few differences but I've never noticed
them honestly I think the elf one
performs a little bit better and it's a
dollar versus however much this is going
for now so it's not that I don't like
the product it's that it's way too
expensive for what it is since you can
find a dupe for a dollar another thing
that I wasn't a big fan of is this elf
it's clear mascara if you will and it's
it's got one side for your eyebrow and
one side of your eyelashes it's the same
exact stuff but I think it's just to
keep them separate I've used it for my
brows just you know kind of keep them in
line where I want them but it up my
house always look crazy
and then they kind of I don't know I
just don't like using it and I was
hoping it would be great I want to try
some of those like waxy type things that
um you can use but this is just too wet
and when it dries it just your eyebrows
feel like stuck and the skin around it
like it just all feels bizarre I don't
like it but again this was like a dollar
if you're looking for a clear mascara
this might work out right for you but I
don't use it for like my actual
eyelashes so it just yeah you know okay
two more so this is the Revlon Colorstay
concealer and I had such high hopes for
this because I love the Revlon Colorstay
foundation but it I was so disappointed
the sponge applicator hurts to put it on
it just it doesn't really cover much
it's okay but there's so many more
concealers in the world that are way
better for probably even cheaper because
I think this is still like nine or ten
dollars so I just don't like it I'm
trying to use it up but other than that
I will never ever ever repurchase it and
definitely not recommend it so last
thing is this Mac Sheen supreme lipstick
and it's in the shade got a - I don't
even know if they still sell this there
anymore I got it a while ago but it's
this I don't know what I was thinking
because I knew it's like a coral color
so you know that's alright I love those
but it's just so I don't know it's so
creamy if you will it just looks
terrible on my lips like I don't know
how to describe it and I would put it on
except for I hate it on my lips I just
don't want to do it it makes your teeth
look yellow unlike any lipstick I've
ever used it and it's probably just in
the shade I don't know but if you have
any imperfection on your lip it like
highlights it like crazy I don't know
this is the only Sheen supreme I've ever
tried I don't know if that's just in the
way the formula is formulated and so I
just don't like the formula or if it's
the color or if it's a combination of
both but I really don't like this I
don't know anyone that even owns this
color anyway but I wanted like a nice
coral color and I'm so excited and so
yes so that is all those are the
products I would never repurchase again
and I wouldn't recommend and of course
they're just my opinion take it for what
you will because you know we all have
different opinions but if you enjoyed it
subscribe and please see my last
which was my I don't know what I'm
calling it it's my top ten favorite
beauty products or products I would
repurchase time and time again ten
products they can't live without that's
probably I'll call it anyway I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
