might make some of you laugh the way
that I learned I haven't even started
the video but I have to tell you guys
the story so the way that I learned how
to make a thumbnail for a YouTube video
was because I watched a Hugh tuber once
it one of my favorite youtubers she's a
very small youtuber I love her and I
don't even know that she makes videos
anymore I haven't seen her in like a
year
anyway she had done her video and at the
very end you know it was just playing
through I saw her and the video pause
and then do this and I was mesmerized
like what is she doing and then I'm like
oh and I had started my youtube channel
at this point but I hadn't really
figured out how to do thumbnails so I
would like take like weird screenshots
of me like during the video they're
always blurry anyway and so I realized
like that is genius cuz then you can
just pause the video you know and you're
kind of frozen in time and just
screenshot it so I learned that from
someone making a mistake which is just
kind of funny because it made me giggle
but you should know that before every
single video I do it at the beginning
though so I catch it I never do it at
the end but I do at the beginning I'd do
the same thing so just now I was like
like it's so ridiculous if you ever saw
it you would die and I'm sure I'd like
pick my nose in between I don't know
anyway so what are we talking about
today today we are talking about
products that I use incorrectly I misuse
them on purpose and I love it this is
just meant to be for fun it was
something I'd mentioned I think in one
of my like vlogs or vlogmas videos and a
lot of you guys are like yeah just do it
that'd be fun I only have like five
products that I use kind of in a
different way than they're originally
intended and I just thought it'd be fun
to share so one of the products I use
incorrectly and the one that inspired
this video is something this was a
product that I just didn't really like
and then I found another use for it now
I like it so it's the NARS soft matte
complete concealer this is a concealer
that is in a pot it's very dry I'd see
a lot of youtubers using it on their
under-eye so I'm like okay me too then I
put it on my under eye trust them well
for many of them it looked amazing and
I'm like oh my gosh like I can't wait to
buy this so I splurged on it maybe I
don't know a few months ago six seven
eight nine I've lost all track of time I
don't know how long ago it was but and I
was like no because my under eyes I've
got tons of fine lines and they just
won't quit
and no it was all bad and I dry skin so
it's like okay it doesn't work for that
I've tried it every single way I can
think of so it was just sitting in my
drawer and so the other day well this
was a few weeks ago now I was just like
hmm do to dilute to two and I put it on
my eyelid as an eye primer amazing it's
super dry Pinocchio come here
oh hi beagle so I used as an eye primer
amazing it dries down it cancels out all
of your veining discoloration everything
so perfectly even out I was amazed and
it held onto the shadow all day long so
if for some reason you have this and
you're really not using it and open up
and you're really not using it I use it
that way unless you got it early enough
that you can make a return but I know a
lot of other people have told me that
they'll just put this really it's maybe
more meant to be a face concealer not an
under-eye which I could totally get down
with because it's just so dry and unless
you have like the most amazing
moisturized young under eyes how are you
oh don't take that really really like it
that way but I do want to try it as just
like a face concealer a lot of you guys
were saying you'll use it just you'll
powder on any areas like I'm doing this
because I always have redness here
before you put on foundation you'll kind
of Pat this in to cover that those areas
and then put foundation it looks really
nice so I am gonna try it that way as
well all right another one I misuse is
from the drugstore this is the L'Oreal
infallible paints metallics eyeshadow in
the shade Rizzo now I do use this on my
eyes it looks like it's what I'm wearing
but it's not this is this unbelievably
gorgeous pigmented eyeshadow it's like
the prettiest kind of rose champagne
color and I love it it's so
I feel like more people should be
talking about that however I've been
using it as a highlighter and that's
what I'm wearing today I'll usually just
grab a really small like even just a
fluffy eyeshadow brush and just swirl it
in there and just put it there and
that's what I'm wearing and I feel like
it is so pretty it's so pretty and so
like part of me is like okay I really do
like it for my eye but like kind of want
to just put it my highlighter drawer
because it always looks so nice I even
have it on my nose like I just think it
looks gorgeous and I wonder if because
it's an eye shadow I don't know
does it stay longer because it that
doesn't really necessarily make sense
regardless it looks gorgeous and I've
been using it that way more than I have
as an eyeshadow and I don't regret it at
all I don't know if you guys can hear it
but Tyler's watching James Bond the
original Goldfinger is that like the
third movie I don't know he's watching
it right now I can hear the music okay
anyway another product that I use
incorrectly it's not really though this
one's a stretch but I figured it was
worth mentioning to be educational but
the narwhal nose foundation stick I
really do love but because again my skin
is dry right now I haven't been using it
all over my face I can normally do I
especially avoid this region because
that's where I'm the driest this time of
the year and while I do think this is
the most moisturizing foundation stick
I've ever used I still know that it's a
foundation stick and it's just not the
most ideal kind of foundation for dry
skin so this time of year I will just
use this kind of like we were just
talking about this just for spot
concealing and then I'll put foundation
over it flawless flawless I mean it
really because of course it's meant to
be a foundation itself so it makes sense
but by just avoiding those areas it
really and then putting your foundation
on top it friggin amps up the coverage
and it looks so nice so I'll usually
just put like two dots here two dots
there kind of blend it a little bit but
not too much and then kind of Pat
foundation into the skin it looks so so
pretty alright another product that I
use incorrectly is this pixie and Mary
Ann McKie osh glow and bronze palette I
love this palette but I just wasn't
really using it in my
like bronzer highlighter area like at
all because I don't know there's
something about palettes for me face
palettes that I just don't reach for
them and I don't know what it is like
it's like this weird mental block and I
wonder if any of you guys feel the same
way where you're just like I don't know
I just don't reach for them but this
one's really really nice so I slid it
into my eyeshadow drawer I have been
using it so much I used this bronzer
shade today all in my crease kind of
blend it up and I used this was it this
one yeah no I think it might have been
this gold one i padded it onto the lid
now I did put a color pop shadow over it
so it changes it you know but I've been
loving this I think just all of it I was
gonna say I feel like this might be the
only one I really I didn't even have a
place to use this on my face you can
wear it on your lid it's a glowy bronze
so wherever you'd want to put that on
your eye you know it's gorgeous and I
think because these are meant to be face
products especially for like these matte
kind of blending colors because their
face products and they're not meant to
be as like dark as an eyeshadow maybe
should be they just end up looking like
they're blended like a dream they're
just like marshmallow that's not
marshmallow so it makes sense
clouds that none of these make sense but
I just feel like it ends up just looking
like at the softest like blend does that
make sense marshmallows and clouds so I
really like this for that so if you
already have this totally try it or if
you have any kind of contouring and you
know highlighting palette which I know a
lot of us have like at least one amazing
eyeshadows they're perfect neutral
colors you got a shimmer for your lid
you've got you know some kinds of you
know brownish colors for your crease
boom gorgeous another product I misuse
this I can't figure this product out
it's from cargo which this is literally
the only cargo product I own and it's
weird because when I first started
watching YouTube videos way before I had
a channel I remember cargo was like a
big brand like I feel like so many
youtubers would talk about like that was
one like the cargo like Blu ray line
came out or HD of course is whatever it
was
and I can't have been called blu-ray
maybe it was but anyway everyone's
talking with those and like they're
swimmable blushes and bronzers and like
I remember I had friends in college that
I was like oh my gosh saves and I just
make up and they would have cargo you
know and I feel like no one talks about
anymore it's kind of sad so if you have
any favorite cargo products let me know
below because I'm so curious about that
brand it's totally one that like I feel
like he's been swept under the rug for a
few years and I feel like when I've
tried their products I've liked them you
know anyway this is one of their
picture-perfect highlighters in bronze
so I'm like okay
knowing my skin tone this would be a
gorgeous highlighter on someone darker
than me on me no it's it's just too
bronzy and of course my lights are
washing it out so I have been using this
as a blush now stick with me because I
know you're looking at that you're like
Jessica what are you talking about it's
like the prettiest like light peach
color and somehow when I put it on my
cheeks it is the prettiest thing in the
world and the first day I did this cuz I
was like well maybe I'll use it like a
blush topper well I was like you know
what it might be dark enough just try so
I just tried it alone no blush I was
like well first of all don't need a
highlight gorgeous I wish I were you
today I'm wearing another one a flower
Beauty blush that I'm going to talk
about in another video um but I got so
many compliments like you're just so
glowing your blush looks so nice today
I'm like thanks like who complements
freaking blush like but it was such a
nice compliment especially knowing that
I was like trying something kind of
weird for my blush gorgeous
so my advice I doubt many of you have
this specific product however if you
have one of those blushes that is maybe
more of a blush topper color or like a
maybe it's a highlight that's just a
little too dark for you try it as a
blush just straight up even if you're
like no way you might be surprised cuz I
was and I think because it is so light
it just looked like like I didn't even
have to blend because it was just a
little bit darker than my skin tone so
it just was like the perfect amount oh
my gosh alright another product that I
use incorrectly is this Naked skin
concealer now I love I actually really
do like the Naked skin concealer I
thought I wouldn't only because I feel
like so many of these
have these concealers that are so
overhyped and I'm like are they really
that good I mean at the end of the its
concealer that's hard to do really well
considering all of us have different
under eyes and different concerns
regardless I ended up really liking this
however they sent me a bunch of their
colors and this one's way too dark so
I've been using this I got rid of most
of the colors I passed them on but this
one is just this like really pretty
color that's just a little bit bronzer
than I am if you take so this is not
just for this can CR I mean any
concealer if it's just a little bit
bronzer than you are it so you could buy
some like you know under you know around
five to ten dollars to the drugstore if
you wanted to do it if you just dot it
like do to two to two and a little bit
up there and just take your beauty
blender and blend it it is the most
flawless natural looking bronze ever
ever because if you're picking out a
color that's just a little bit bronzer
than your skin tone it's really gonna
look kind of natural so someone's gonna
look at you and think is she wearing
bronzer is that just like her skin do
you know what I'm saying and I feel like
that's the look I always want to go for
like why wouldn't you want I know some
people like I don't know anyway really
um the thing I'm really like not making
any sense
I'm really enjoying doing that and I
feel like because it's not a powder it
makes my skin look less dry again the
less powder on my face probably the
better so those are all of the products
that I use incorrectly on purpose I hope
you enjoyed this kind of video if you
did give it a thumbs up subscribe and
hit that notification bell and I will
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
