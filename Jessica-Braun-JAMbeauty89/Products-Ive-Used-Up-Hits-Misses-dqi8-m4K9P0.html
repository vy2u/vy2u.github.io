I have used up and I'm throwing away and
I always I remember the first time I
ever watched one of these videos I was
like why would anyone be showing their
trash but the thing is you get kind of
like mini reviews about each of the
products that the person has used up and
see if they liked it you know especially
after using it enough that they used up
the entire product usually you have a
pretty good opinion or view on how the
product works so here we go so one of
the things I constantly agree by is the
Aussie 3 minute miracle this is a deep
conditioner these are only three dollars
anywhere you go I usually buy mine at
Target or Walmart but yeah it says it's
a deep conditioner it smells incredible
it smells like coconut but like a like a
vanilla coconut but not I don't know how
to describe the smell but it smells so
good that smell stays in your hair for
the next like day or two I don't use
this every time I wash my hair usually
just once or twice a week do I actually
use the deep conditioner and this is
great if you've got like a really
clarifying shampoo that you like a lot
then this kind of adds back in that
moisture that was just stripped from
your hair by using a clarifying shampoo
so I really really love this I noticed a
change in my hair when I use it but I
don't like to over you just because it
does add moisture to your hair so if you
do already have oily prone oil prone
hair you probably wouldn't love this but
otherwise I love it I bought it like
five times I love it and I'm gonna be
rebinding it okay another thing I really
like is the EOS shave cream and they
have it in this pink kind which is
pomegranate raspberry they also have a
one that's like cream I think I might be
like vanilla and then they also have one
more that's in like a lavender colored
bottle umm these are nice you know it
comes with like a pump it's dirty but
who cares right although I didn't clean
these out and one other thing I'm gonna
mention
I do recycle and so all of these types
of containers that are recyclable you
know you've got to clean out dry off and
then recycle so um no worries there but
anyway I really like this although it is
a little pricey for what it is and you
run through it really quickly
so even though I've probably bought this
like three times
I might repurchase it if it's like on
sale but if not I'll probably just buy a
different brand maybe one that I have a
coupon for that I haven't tried out yet
because it's not I don't notice it like
making a huge difference and like how
soft my legs are anything like that but
it's nice okay another thing I've used
up is this matrix bio Lodge it's for
tank therapy so it's supposed to be
strengthening for your hair and this is
okay I you I used to have the
conditioner I used it up so I've been
using this alongside the Aussie 3 minute
miracle conditioner it's okay I don't
think it's worth the price that it is I
think if I were gonna spend upwards of
20 dollars for a shampoo I would buy a
different one but I when I first got it
I really really liked it but I I don't
know now I just I think I found other
shampoos and conditioners that I like
better so another thing I've bought
quite a few times is the lavoris
whitening rinse it's another two Claire
it's good this is one that you've used
before you brush your teeth so it's kind
of nice and I think I am going to go
back to the crest like 3d white rinse
because I really noticed the difference
with that and this I noticed the
difference and you know for a dollar for
the bottle you really can't beat it but
I think that the crest one really does
work better so we'll see now the thing
I've used up which I've talked about a
jillion times is the Bed Head
masterpiece hairspray this is usually in
a darker teal bottle I just love it it
smells great it just leaves a touchable
you know feel to your hair I really like
it it's really expensive though so again
I wait for those who go on sale then
I'll buy them but otherwise I found a
dupe recently which if you watch my
latest haul video which I'll link down
below
I mentioned the new hairspray that I
bought that I'm really really liking
feeling it will be in my monthly
favorites but we'll see another thing
this is a hand soap one of the foaming
and I always get the foaming kinds
because in this from Bath and Body Works
um because with the other ones they have
like two other kinds I think's the kind
with the beads and then the kind that's
just like the creamy and I feel like I
can never get all of that off my hands
when I'm washing them but this always
feels like it really does rinse clean so
I like the foaming this is in the set
vanilla berry sorbet and this was on
sale I swear I bought like four of these
I love love love the scent I don't even
know that they sell this anymore if you
know if they do let me know down below
in the comments cuz I want to buy more I
replaced this with another one of these
but it's my last one so okay let's see
these I mentioned also my last haul I
just bought some more of these this is
the green tea cleansing tissues from the
brand MPL there this was the pack of 60
with their like plastic
opener thing and it's two dollars at Big
Lots if you have one near you I've never
seen them at any other store but they're
so inexpensive and then you can also buy
packs of thirty for a dollar they're
great they stay moist they don't rip up
or anything like that I really love them
okay
two candles and then on to the makeup
empties woah this I brought up the brand
candle light they're so cheap at CVS in
places like that this was a daughter 99
it's the smaller size but I have a
holder that this fits perfectly in and
this is in soft cotton blanket I really
love the smell but look it didn't burn
all the way down but the wick is like
done you know what I mean it's just done
for but I was really sad but again it
was 99 it lasted me probably a month so
I can't really complain I guess you know
okay another thing I've used up this is
the slot cutting company tropical spice
and this one looks like it's not done
but again these wicks won't light
anymore so and I know that you can put
them on candle warmers which I might do
because there is so much wax left in
these that I'm kind of I don't really
want to throw them away and I know that
you can get rid of the wax and stuff and
use them which I do but I don't really
need anymore holders for anything right
now so we'll see but I liked this scent
I'm not sure that they still smell it
sell it though
so okay on to the makeup empties so
exciting
okay one thing I finished up was the
chapstick classic I'd really like it I
just recently went to Target and bought
a four pack for like three dollars so
I've really been liking this and
therefore I have repurchased it this is
the Revlon Colorstay base coat and it's
there's still a bit left and I could put
like a nail thinning nail polish thinner
you know what I'm saying whatever the
calls in this um and I might but I
figured I'd mention it because by the
time I film another empties video I'm
sure I will have long since then throw
this away so I might put like a nail
thinner in it but I don't own any yet
but um it might be worth purchasing
because I do love love love this base
coat but I just recently switched to the
such base again I mentioned that in my
last haul video of course my nails are
like naked right now there's nothing
awesome so but anyway yeah so I like it
though I recommend and if you're looking
for one I think you'll really like this
I've bought this like three or four
times oh okay mascara empties I finished
up the Maybelline one by one it's pretty
much dried up I really do like this
mascara it really separates your lashes
really well and if you use it with
another volumizing one like say the
rocket it really like you can use a lot
of volume and then use this to make sure
they're separated and kind of fanned out
evenly you know so this is a great combo
but I like this even alone especially if
you'd like a more soft look and then of
course I've mentioned this a thousand
times the rocket I love this one I
probably have another week or two but
again I figured I'd mention it now but
I'll probably repurchase the rocket oh
right I've got a mess but of course
wouldn't be an empties video without
like a mess of things okay I finished up
a few quite a few concealers this is the
Maybelline fit me there's a little bit
left but I'm just done with it you know
you ever feel that way I was trying to
use it up but I don't even like how I
look during the day like a couple of
hours after I use this so I'm just
tossing it um but it's mostly used up
it's kind of dried up and if you can see
that but it's the Maybelline fit me not
a big fan
I can repurpose it this I loved and I
forgot to mention it in my Maybelline
best and worst of Maybelline I'll link
that down below as well I forgot to
mention this this is the dream Lumi
concealer it's got this brush and you um
like you know twist it up and it comes
through the brush and then you can put
it on its like a highlighter concealer I
love this stuff this is the most
blendable concealer I I have to sneeze
oh my gosh hold on Oh nope yes no yeah
excuse me wait okay
I always sneeze more than one time every
time I don't think I've ever sneezed
just once
plus it's allergy season so anyway um I
love this stuff I'm going to be
repurchasing it but I want to try out
another type of lightening concealers
that I have before I buy this again but
I love it and recommend it
another concealer that I mentioned on my
like products I don't like my Revlon
Colorstay under-eye concealer I just
don't like it again it's like the
Maybelline fit me I don't like it it
doesn't really cover what I need it to
cover
no thank you okay I finished up an Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion this is
the one that's just like a plain color
there's no color to it I know some
people have mentioned that they really
like the ones that have some color to it
so I might try those out but again I've
mentioned the elf eyelid primers that I
like and it's really hard for me to
spend more than like $1 to $3 on an
eyeshadow primer when I already know
that I like those elf ones so we'll see
if I buy it maybe if it's like in a kit
or something okay I again it's not
completely gone yet but I figured I'd
mention is my Rimmel stay matte powder I
love it
I get it in a shade well like a few
shades darker than I normally would
because I think it kind of warms up my
skin just a little bit but not so much
that it doesn't match this is in 0:04
sandstorm and I've already read bought
this a second one waiting in the wings
okay
oh I finished up a floss this is just
the johnson and johnson reach gloss
definitely you got to get the kind with
wax if it's not waxed and my teeth just
tear it apart cuz my
like tight last two things are this
there's the Smashbox limitless eyeliner
it's in onyx I think yeah which is just
they're black this is not as like
emollient you know what I mean as this
next one which is the NYX slide on glide
on blah blah blah blah eyeliner in black
or blackest black of course it doesn't
say cuz it's worn off cuz it's sharpened
off you know what I mean I really like
both of these actually but I the NYX
slide on ones are definitely comparable
to the urban decay ones and they're just
very very they just literally the name
is slide on eyeliner it really just
slides on this is just awesome it's
really great for tightlining especially
which is usually what I use it for so
I'm still gonna use these little babies
up but they're pretty much gone so I
figured I'd mention them but anyway that
is all and I hope you enjoyed this and
let me know if you did by giving it a
thumbs up I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
