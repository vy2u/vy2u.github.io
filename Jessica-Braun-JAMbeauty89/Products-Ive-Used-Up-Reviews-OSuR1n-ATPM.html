empties video for you guys and if you
don't know what these are which I'm sure
most of you do it's just where I kind of
show you my trash know my beauty
products that I've gone through over the
past who knows how long a really really
long time and just kind of give you a
full review on each product well I mean
short reviews but the idea is that if
you've used it the whole product and use
it enough that you've used it up then
you probably have a good idea on how you
feel about it the I have and some of
this is even in the bag I have a bag
filled and then I still have some things
here at the table so huh let's get
started
so one of the things that I have is this
kms curl up bounce back spray I've had
this for so long it was from when I did
a show a couple years ago and the person
doing my hair let me keep this and you
know what I'll show this one as well as
well as this mop modern organic products
as the brand miss their CC SystemC curl
curl enhancing cream so he gave me both
of these and I actually there's still a
little bit left in this one and this one
but they're so old I almost just am a
little scared to use them this one still
is like that much left and this one has
about this and the nozzles messed up but
I think it's just time for me to get rid
of these so but I remember liking this
gel I don't think I liked this hairspray
at all so and I know you know if they
still sell these they probably do but
who really knows so another thing that
is almost used up and I just want to
show it now just to be done with it is
this Dove style and care flexible
hairspray I showed this in a favorites
recently I don't know if it was January
February but the more I've used it the
less I like the smell and I don't think
it holds well enough at all like it it's
a flexible hold and that's the idea and
it's touchable but I don't think it D
frizzes enough to even it's like it's
not really doing anything it just kind
of almost makes your hair just a little
bit greasy err but not in a good way so
the first few times I used it really the
first couple weeks I liked it but as
I've used it more I don't think I liked
it and I'm not gonna repurchase it and
the smells kind of making me nauseous
these days so yeah another thing that I
have not used up completely but I just
need to get rid of is this Gio do
deodorant and I just showed in my March
favorites a deodorant a natural
deodorant that I am loving this is
another natural deodorant that smells
amazing but it does not work for me at
all oh my gosh at all and it's so
heartbreaking because I love the smell
but nope nope no getting rid of it
another thing I've used up is this soft
soap body butter heavenly vanilla and I
mean it smelled great I don't think it
necessarily made a different effect on
my skin you know any certain you know it
just smells really good but I got it for
a couple bucks at Big Lots and it lasted
me a while it takes me forever to go
through body wash isn't that weird I
used a really small amount I guess cuz
it lathers well and you know anyway I
don't won't repurchase it cuz it wasn't
anything to write home about really okay
another thing is this batiste dry
shampoo and this is the blush scent it
smells really nice not my favorite scent
the world but it does smell nice and I
like it I think it is the best dry
shampoo I've ever used I mean I know
that it is but it does leave a white
cast so I've bought a few of these
because they were on sale once I go
through all of them I think then I'll
start buying the brunette version of
this but I do have a few more of these
to go through so it'll be a while but I
like this smell I think it's the best
direction who I've ever used so that is
a plus Hey another thing that you can
see it's actually still up to here I'm
gonna finish up but I wanted to show it
now because the next time I do an
empties video will be in months and
months and I don't want to hold onto
this for months and months this is the
L'Oreal ever sleep precious oil
treatment it's okay I used before this I
have been using the organics one and I
really liked that one and this one
doesn't seem to really have any effect
on my hair and how it helps not see I
don't even think it really does anything
but I figure I'll use it up just because
I don't like wasting I mean there's a
few things I'm getting rid of that are
still full and that's hard enough but
this I mean I'll use this up still but
I'm not gonna rebuy it and frankly I
think I saw this on clearance so I think
it's now like being discontinued who
knows so another thing
here's spray I'm like sweating okay this
Aussie awesome volume hairspray it's
like three or four dollars at the
drugstore I thought it was pretty good
this is the like I want to say like six
time I bought this no you're
exaggerating just probably third times
six come on
but I like it it's not my favorite but I
end up gravitating toward it every time
I want a stronger hold hairspray and I
don't know why and it stinks because it
actually does stink I really don't like
the smell and I love the like classic
Aussie hairspray smell but this doesn't
have that it's a different smell I just
don't really like it but I like the
formula so you know oh my gosh there's
so much you guys are gonna be like shut
up this video see long okay speaking of
dry shampoos this is a suave carrots an
infusion dry shampoo I I didn't like it
and it's it's supposed to be comparable
to the bumble and bumble I've never
tried the bumble bumble but I really
didn't like this so it makes me think
maybe I wouldn't like the bubble bubble
I probably would it's so expensive
though anyway so this was really
inexpensive it's okay but I would still
buy the you know what is this the
batiste version over this any day um
alright there's gonna be a pile of
things behind me face that I used a
crest 3d white it's my favorite I just
bought a different kind though for this
one I just ran out of this the other day
and I bought a different one and sorry I
just like completely just blanked whoa
that was freaky anyway alright
never can I use up with this hand soap
that I found at the Dollar Tree and it's
the Jergens extra moister moisturizing
hand wash but I could not say that and
it was actually nice that has that
classic cherry almond scent that Jergens
has which I don't hate but I don't love
but it really was a moisturizing soap I
was so pleasantly surprised so I think
if I see this at the Dollar Tree again I
might buy another one and save it until
like fall or winter when my hands are
really dry again cuz it was a really
nice winter stuff I was very pleasantly
surprised by that
alright another thing that used up some
makeup this is gonna be all mixed in is
this Rimmel lasting finish around
there's a little bit left but look how
dark it is do you guys see this the
kicker is this is the lightest shade at
least that miner near me where I bought
it and I actually really did like the
formula this which is why most of its
gone but I changed color I mean I think
it was already too dark for me but I
also think it's kind of changed color
may be oxidized a little bit I don't
know because it is getting older so it's
just time to go I don't even think I've
never even this dark in the summer I
mean let's be real are you kidding me
that's crazy
crazy another deodorant that's gotta go
is the Dove go fresh cool essentials one
this was before I started the hunt for
natural and again I really like the
smell of it but it does not work on me
at all so it's just such a downer it's
there's still a little bit left I
actually use most of this one but of
course this one's not natural either and
it still didn't work on me I'm like geez
what's wrong with me what is wrong with
me alright some nail polish things that
are just it's time to go I want to find
the other one it goes with it we're
gonna do this okay first of all this OPI
natural nail strengthener
it's like turn yellow can you guys see
how yellow it is this is so old it might
have been the first OPI product I've
ever owned won't even like go back down
and I remember hating it even when I
first got it it did not strengthen my
nails I felt like my nails were still
breaking all the time so I don't
recommend if they even still sell this
but definitely time to go now to
products that I would recommend that I
love and I repurchase again and again
are the Revlon base and topcoat from
their color stay you know line I love
these now there's still a little bit
left but they get a little wonky after a
while not in the same way that such
wheat such wheat not in the same way
that such feet gets all goopy it doesn't
really get goofy although the base coat
does a little bit it's just not it's
just not quite the same alright another
thing that I used up is this satin care
sensitive shave stuff I really like this
I just bought another one in like a
scented one because this one's unscented
but they all have a touch of Olay and I
really like that and they're like two
dollars so you know shave cream is
shavers you know me
oh no another thing my Rimmel
scandaleyes retro glam is going bye-bye
it's been open for long enough and I've
noticed that it started to flake I could
probably get a little more use out of it
but I keep finding black flakes and I'm
like man it's just not worth it I've got
so many mascaras to try I already have a
backup of this so it's just time for
this little guy to go but you guys know
everyone loved him another empty these
Rusk
okay Rusk sensories calm shampoo and
conditioner these were like the blue
ones they're expensive and they were not
anything I mean really I noticed no
difference it's supposedly guarana and
ginger nourishing shampoo I live I mean
there was nothing special about this at
all and now I didn't pay full price I
think I got these at Marshall's you know
when you can get up for like five or six
bucks or something
so it wasn't that bad but even still I'm
like these should be like good if there
is expensive as they are regularly
another thing is the EOS sweet mint lip
balm there's a little bit left I might
try and use it I don't even know but it
still smells good I love this it's
gotten so dirty that's so gross from
being in my purse just thrown around but
I've already bought a new one of these I
need to get like four of these for
everywhere that I am because these are
my favorite lip balm ever they're
amazing they're absolutely amazing and I
did not if you're someone that didn't
like or if you just don't like any of
the EOS lip balms and you haven't tried
this one yet try it
I promise because I hated every single
one I tried I was like these are drying
they feel waxy they feel weird and then
I tried this one just on a whim and I
was like this is completely different
than all the other ones it's
moisturizing it smells nice it doesn't
feel waxy it's okay another thing that's
basically empty is my Anasazi a clear
brow gel I got this in a kit at Sephora
with this and like the brow powder which
has lasted me like a year and it's I
still haven't hit pan and I use it every
single day on my brows and then like a
little dual sided brush but this I can
proc I might keep for a little while
longer and get a little more on it but
it's just a clear mascara that you brush
through your brows and the thing about
this compared
all the other brow gels that I have and
try and use is this one almost it's
almost like a hairspray in a way it
really it like actually like hardens
your brows into place in the best way it
doesn't look weird or anything but they
do not move with this stuff and I love
that and the only reason I know that
this is just about out is just because I
was using it the day and they haven't
been hard if you will and I'm like whom
this must be like actually running low
it's hard to tell because it's clear but
anyway so I think it's just about time
for that but I love it and my Canadian
subscriber friend sent me a miniature
one so that'll be the next one eye
opener but right now I'm using some
other ones anyway
another thing that is on its last leg is
this elf
makeup remover pen this thing lasted me
like a year and a half but it's perfect
for if you get you know mascara smudges
there or anywhere or anything anywhere
you can use this to get it up the best
part is after a while you can take the
tip out I'll show ya and flip it over
I've clearly already done that but this
is like three hours I just ordered
another one from elf so I'll be getting
I love those I use them all the time I
take them with me and I travel and
everything another scent that I used up
is this be enchanted from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works one of my favorite scents of all
times every time that I wear it I get
compliments from strangers from friends
from my boyfriend it's just such a
beautiful scent just a very girly but
beautiful scent and the packaging is
adorable are you kidding me
so I love this if you haven't smelled it
definitely go give it a smell I need to
see if they have a candle version of
this because that would be baller
another mascara that I'm throwing out is
the Pilate o4d boost it's starting to
dry out this one was one they sent me
and I just didn't like it as much as I
like my curls roll one that I've been
talking about lately boyfriend this one
has a bigger wand than that one and it's
it's okay it's just not it's not one of
my favorites and it's starting to dry
out so I figured it's just time to go
I'm never reaching for it another thing
I used up and I was very sad when I used
up is my it's a 10 miracle leave-in plus
keratin spray it's literally like a
lotion spray and I was amazed that it
sprayed too there's a little bit left
but I'm
I'm gonna try but it's just really cool
it's literally like a lotion you're
spraying into your hair and I just it
helped detangle it helped kind of add
some moisture back into it before you
even blow-dry it I really liked this
stuff but it's really pricey so I don't
know and right now I'm using a detangler
I really like but it's not thick like
this it's more of just a liquid another
thing that I used up is my L'Oreal
infallible what cream liner or what do
they even call it lacquer liner but it's
a cream or gel eyeliner it's woah I love
this stuff it were who works better than
high-end ones that I've tried this is
amazing this and the Maybelline one are
great in their drugstore you know and
they're better than like right now I
just matchbox one and I I don't think I
like it it's not as black as this one is
so we'll see I might end up repurchasing
this sucker another favorite that I'm
sad to see go there's a little bit left
and I am gonna finish using it and it
all wore off this is I've had it forever
it's the covergirl perfect point plus
this is a very black retractable liner
I'm constantly surprised by now I
usually don't wear it alone
I usually tight line with it but I love
that it's always semi sharp you know you
don't have to worry about bringing a
sharpen or anything like that and it
just works and typically it came out but
there's like a little smudger on the
back with the little lid so you can
smudge with it I just was pleasantly
surprised with this so another thing
I've used is this sugar it was the one
that was the birthday gift like two
years ago or a year ago from Sephora and
it was the clear I can never get it off
the clear one there's a little left I'm
gonna finish using up but it's just a
really lemony scent it's clear it's just
a nice balm it's kind of different than
what I like and a lip balm so I ended up
using and liking it but it's not my
favorite I don't know if I'll repurchase
it coz the texture of is odd if you've
used it you know what I mean and how
it's different it's not I mean it seems
to be a good product I never had dryness
it always felt moisturizing it was just
different almost as if it sat on top of
your lips you know what I mean I don't
know but I liked it well enough it's
just really expensive on its own another
thing I used up is this dr. teals vapor
bath sleep scented bubble bath and I'm a
big fan of a bubble bath and I
really liked this I think that I want to
say my best friend Sarah got this for me
yeah it's got this really strong
lavender scent and I really really liked
getting bubble baths with this I might
be repurchasing this again soon because
I just like it right now I've been using
bath salts but I really like these
because it's all bubbly and wonderful
and it's so aromatic I love it some
candles I used up I still more makeup -
is this Paula Deen creme brulee candle
now this I found at Big Lots for four
dollars it's a pretty big jar took a
while to go through and it smelled great
but anyway another one I used up is the
summertime some mores from Bath and Body
Works it literally smells it still does
it literally smells like marshmallows
and campfire it's it's amazing it is
amazing I ended up burning it in the
winter though but who cares I might put
this on a candle warmer just to get like
all the scent out of it because it it
smells so good are you kidding me okay
another thing I've used that before I
get to the rest of the makeup is this
lavoris or Lavery's whitening rinse you
can get this at the dollar store I don't
know that it's that whitening I mean I
don't think it is I don't know it's been
around for supposed like 100 yeah over a
hundred years since 1903 so it's like
111 years and it's okay it's kind of got
a weird taste I think it's probably
better than not using whitening rinse at
all because you know like the crest ones
they're all so expensive really I mean
for what it is and this is only a dollar
so usually when I'm in a pincher I'm
just like I want something but I don't
feel like spending ten dollars on a huge
bottle of crest 3d white I'll just get
this in the time between and I think
it's okay I don't know I don't know I
never know how to feel about that I
bought that a million times
okay the last few makeup items are ones
okay well one of these I hate it's the
voluminous million lashes but L'Oreal
but it's a waterproof now I've heard a
lot of you guys when I first talked
about this you guys were telling me that
there is like the regular version is so
much better and I and that could be true
and I was so sad because the packaging
is adorable
I like the brush but there's something
about the waterproof formula it was like
it was bad I couldn't get it off now of
course it's waterproof so it should be
harder to get off but this was like
scary impossible to get off like I was
terrified for my lashes
and it was just like flaky all over the
place like it wouldn't stay on like it
was the weirdest experience so I was
really sad about that I think I'm just
gonna get rid of it
I'm tired of looking at it and being
disappointed this is the Physicians
Formula organic where it's just it's
getting old now I mean that's it's very
old now but I didn't love it mostly just
because it never dries on your lashes
really which is the nature of the
ingredients in it I think but it just
really bothered me because I'll you know
want to itch my eye or like you know
right where the lash meets your lid
it'll be e and I'll try and itch it and
then I have mascara all over myself and
it's been on for five hours you know so
it just never dries and it bothered me
so but other than that I mean it was a
nice mascara I liked the way it looked
so if that wouldn't bother you you'd
probably like that and that is
everything oh my gosh look at this you
guys that is a big mess okay so
hopefully that was informative for you
to watch I know those were really quick
reviews although this of course ended up
being a 20 minute video I'm sure but I
hope that was helpful for you all and
I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
