show you a bunch of products that I have
finished that I've got some really hard
opinions on huh it's almost all good
actually
and I feel like a lot of my past empties
videos I I feel like I don't like
anything but in this case there's
actually a lot that I love that I'm like
IV they're already repurchase in fact
that's the case for quite a few of these
or just some things that I'm like I like
I would recommend but I already have too
many other products that I don't need to
buy another one right now so let's go
ahead and get into it so let's talk
makeup first cuz I know that's why most
of you are here I had a few empties now
when you got a collection the size of
mine and you guys know I declutter and
I'm constantly getting rid of things and
passing them on to people that will love
them because it's it's too much and
obviously this is one of my jobs and I
know that it's just part of it is trying
out things and reviewing them that is
literally my job but it's nice actually
finished some things from time to time
which I know sounds silly to some of you
but one of the ones that I it wasn't
quite finished but it was just getting
old night decluttered it if you will is
this NYX mega shine lip gloss in beige I
have already repurchased this it's one
of the very few lip glosses I've ever
repurchased but it is the most beautiful
it's called beige but it is the most
perfect pink lip gloss ever it does have
a cherry sentence if you don't like that
fake cherry scent you'd hate this
because it is a strong one but I love
this it looks so beautiful I've traveled
with it constantly because it's so
beautiful but I have had this one for
too long so it is time to go in the
trash but I love it i've already
repotted another makeup product this NYX
control freak I blew through this I've
already rebaudioside gel it's like five
or six dollars at the drugstore or Ulta
and it's just amazing you just comb
through your brows and then it just kind
of holds the shape all day it's not as
strong of a hole just like the Anastasio
one but for the price it's really really
good and it's not as wet as like the
Maybelline clear ones or whatever that
brand is that one's really wet and I
feel like it never really holds but this
one is absolutely amazing I love it
like I said I've already repurchased it
and I'll probably repurchase it again
after that toss I think the packaging is
cute with the white I just like it
and another makeup one that it's just
about gone is this Rimmel match
perfection concealer this is one that
it's a two-in-one concealer and
highlighter so it's a little bit lighter
of a shade I really liked this I hated
the packaging as it was a brush tip and
it would get all over this lid so I
would wreak lien it or clean it out all
the time but this one I can't squeeze
any more out of even though it looks you
can't I can't that's I mean that's it
and I could cut it from like you know
what I've had this for long enough it's
time I had it in 125 fair and it really
did cover in highlight I don't think
it's the highest coverage concealer ever
but I do think it was really really nice
and honestly I've I this at a store at
the store a few times since I've kind of
finished it up and thought I should
rebuy because I really did like it and
then I remembered no I have like 20
concealers I need to go through the last
thing I need to do is buy another one
but it really was nice if you're looking
for maybe a new one to try I'd recommend
this sorry for the packaging it was
really nice okay
so that was actually all the makeup and
I know that's so sad
but I mean that's just the reality now
there were a few other things that are
Beauty related some skincare that I
finished this was the juice beauty stem
cellular cleansing oil hmm here's the
way I use it I would pump it into my
face and I would just rub it together it
was a cleansing oil and I would just rub
it all over my eyes and it would break
down the makeup and then I would kind of
get a little bit more and do the rest of
my face rinse it off and then I use a
cleanser to actually get everything else
off my face it was good it did its job
well but it's really expensive for what
it is I guess that's what I would say it
was a great product but it was too
expensive I and I hate that you know you
go through it so quickly you don't want
to spend $30 $40 on something like this
when you blow through it so I wouldn't
repurchase it just because of the price
point that's what I'll say but it was
good this is the serum a hydrating
cleanser this is the best of ever and I
actually have a little bit left but I
wanted to show it in this video because
it'll be gone soon I love this stuff it
lasted quite a while because it's a
bigger bottle it's a pump it's
inexpensive it's at the drugstore and
this
is the first survey product I had tried
and it really is hydrating like it
cleanses your face so nicely but it
leaves your face still feeling
moisturize you don't feel stripped so if
you've got really dry skin I would
highly recommend this - combo and I
would still recommend it I think if
you've got oily skin you might not need
their hydrating I would try their other
cleanser if you're looking for a
drugstore option that is just as amazing
as anything high-end I've ever tried
this is it you guys I will repurchase
this it is absolutely amazing it's on
par with my polished choice once which
you guys know I love polished choice
this is amazing and so yes I'm going to
repurchase it I need to repurchase it
cuz it's almost out this is the kinder a
c8 peptide under eye treatment this is
really pricey I actually bought it on
HauteLook because that's where I get all
these high-end like skincare and
high-end makeup for 50% off and if you
don't know about whole look oh my gosh
I'll put the link below it is I
literally I think almost all of my
two-faced products and my what else to
face I buy from their lorac I buy from
their on no.not Anastacio what else went
by from there there's a lot Tarte is on
there a lot so a lot of those of the
balm a lot of those high-end products
that I have I have a lot of because I
buy them on HauteLook and they're like
50% off when they come on there so
definitely check it out if you don't
know oh my gosh anyway I got this on
there so it was a little bit cheaper and
it's just an under eye like moisturizer
serum type thing I didn't notice
anything drastic
so I mean while it was nice and I
certainly used all of it up I didn't
notice like any insane changes and I
used it for a couple months and that's
just it about a lot of skincare
especially with under-eye treatments you
just hope that it's working because over
time you're just hoping that you're
helping sustain your skin so it was nice
but it was expensive and I don't think
it was necessarily anything
life-changing that's raw say okay my
favorite toothpaste of all time that
crest 3d white
I got Tyler hooked onto this cuz he was
buying a new one he's like Jessica your
teeth are so much whiter than mine might
not thank you kind of work on it though
it's not like it's naturai work on it
but this 3d white stuff I swear you guys
it really is the life-changing you don't
have to worry
using the strips and stuff because my
teeth are really sensitive and they
react really badly to that stuff but
this has been amazing and I notice the
difference between when I use it and
when I don't it is amazing the 3d rinse
is amazing as well and I use that every
day too
so highly recommend that um I finished
the coffee scrub from the what was one
of the more Naturals things that I unbox
it's like a bath and body I did not want
this stuff to end it was one of those
body scrubs that you know it's almost
summer and so I'm like I've got dead
skin to get rid of and just trying to
slough off all this winter dry flaky
skin and this was the coarsest
scrub I've ever tried to smell by coffee
I think it had coffee in it it was the
most amazing scrub I've ever used it was
such a tiny thing I'm like now I want
like a tub of this stuff and I tried so
many scrubs this was the best one I've
ever tried so I loved it it finished a
perfume this might mark the first time
ever I've included one of these since
I've started a youtube channel but it's
a flower bomb perfume by Viktor and Rolf
I love it it's Tyler's favorite on me
next to that one I mentioned from sin
bird the lovey a bell one he loves that
one but this one when I ran out he was
like oh man and he actually bought this
for me a couple years ago for our
universe erease so it lasted quite a
while but it's a very very sweet smell
so if you don't like sweet you'd hate it
but it's a very sweet smell but it is so
amazing I think once I actually run
through some maybe I will repurchase it
I don't know but it's one of those
things that you get so tired of a scent
don't you like you don't really
necessarily want to repurchase it so
we'll see I don't know but maybe for
Tyler's think I will we'll see the one
candle I finished I'm pretty sure I
finished other ones but I think I just
ended up tossing them because I didn't
feel like but vanilla snowflake I did
want to mention from Bath and Body Works
it is the sweetest vanilla scent I
really love it the center on this was
surprising and so I don't know I know
obviously this is from actually it's
from 2013 I think I just didn't burn it
doesn't matter I love it recommend it I
also finished this cherry almond
shortbread hand wash our hands tote from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works the best-smelling oh
my gosh it's the best smell ever oh my
gosh like
it's cherries and yet it's got almonds
so it's almost like a vanilla scent in
the shortbread again like a vanilla it
is the best mixture of smells
ever I love it year-round but especially
in the fall in winter I hope they come
back out with it because I will buy it
again and I want to get a candle I don't
think they had a candle but I asked them
when I got this is that are they ever
gonna do like other things in this
sentence she said honestly it's been a
pretty big seller so maybe next year so
I'm praying that there's gonna be a
candle in that I also finished okay this
is an awesome awesome product the
Garnier Fructis texture tease so when
you've got thin hair like I do and
you're wanting to do a messy bun it's
really difficult cuz my hair you know it
gets way down so when I want to have it
kind of up and messy it's hard to get it
to stay that way because it wants to
just sit you know what I mean so this
has been the cheapest best texturizing
spray
you just kind of spray it throughout
your hair especially in this region and
when you put your hair up it'll actually
like hold its place because it's got
grit to it and I tried texturizing spray
before but they were always really
expensive and like Oh like I don't want
to know let's spend all this money on
this stuff that again you just blow
through this is amazing and it's so
cheap so I am definitely going to be
repurchasing this I can't believe I
haven't repurchased it yet but it is so
amazing for that purpose definitely
check it out I'm telling you I'm telling
you it's life-changing I also finished
this hairspray it's the organics brand
or OGX now and it's their argan oil
Morocco elevated finish spray it smells
amazing but it's not anything it's not
like a life-changing hair spray I don't
think I'll rebuy it although it did
smell nice and I always got compliments
on my hair about the way it smelled when
I use this but it's nothing that it
doesn't like hold it crazy well but it
also doesn't like not weigh it down I
mean I don't know I have nothing special
to say about it now the very last thing
I'm dropping all of them you're
wondering what I'm wearing on my lips
it's this elf matte lip color and wine I
actually just filmed this huge alcohol
with a giveaway and I don't know if I'll
put that up first then this or what
water it'll be in but definitely check
out for it because there's a giveaway
but that's what I'm wearing and I love
it so amazing anyway so the very last
thing I dimension I have 3 empty whoa
and it's the batiste dry shampoo I'm
starting to formulate some hard
Kenyon's on these because they have so
many types and now I tried almost all of
them so I feel like I can really
recommend amazing ones I have like a
trial size that I try I travel with this
stuff like crazy I need to buy more of
these small size because I realized that
one of the most priceless things I've
ever packed is dry shampoo because when
you're vacationing the last thing you
feel like worrying about is washing your
hair every single day but when it starts
little greasy like mine does by day to
gosh by the end of day 1 you need dry
shampoo and when I don't have it I'm
like oh man so I love traveling with
just a small one so I need to buy some
more of these because it's priceless but
I also have the big ones I always buy
these at Marshall's and TJ Maxx cuz so
at $5.99 you can order them online I
think also sells them too this is the
dark and deep brown one and I keep going
back and forth on this one because it
does have a hint of color so it can get
on your skin it can get on your hands
but if you once you get used to using it
it really is amazing because it doesn't
leave that white cast so you don't have
to brush it out as much whereas with any
of the other ones that just have an
amazing scent which these do this is the
cherry and this is the tropical I think
out of the two the tropical smells like
coconuts and like the beach the cherry
this is the one I just finished I didn't
love the cherry but I'm not huge on
cherry sense I don't mind it like in the
lip gloss but in my hair I didn't love
it I liked the tropical better but those
leave a white cast which I use the
cherry one actually today this is day 2
hair if you can tell but you have to
brush through it like crazy because it
does leave a white cast where is that
this one it's not as crazy which I love
but again you have to be really careful
when you use it so I probably will I
gone so back and forth in this and
videos but I probably will buy this
again because it was just so nice not to
worry about the white cast but I just
got to get more used to the way I have
to use it you know what I mean so those
are all my empties hopefully it was fun
I know there wasn't a ton of makeup but
that's always the way these go for I
think most of us but let me know if
you'd like me to continue these I hate
holding onto trash anyone that does
these knows it sucks to hold on to all
the trash it takes up room but if
they're you know if you guys love them
I'll continue to do it but if you guys
hate of them I'm not gonna keep holding
onto all this trash so let me know down
below and if you're interested in
more of my videos please subscribe I'd
love to have you guys as fellow jammers
and I'll catch you guys in my next video
