share with you guys products that
shocked me and these are products that
either blew me away they I figured there
would be good that they exceeded my
expectations or their products that I
thought would be good and they were
terrible so let's go ahead get into it
so let's start with the most important
thing which is our skin we don't take
care of that everything else will look
crazy on top of it so one of my favorite
skin care items I've ever used is this
be enigma all-in-one face cream now this
video is sponsored by B enigma and I'm
so excited because I had tried this for
the first time about a year and a half
ago I heard top you talked about it and
so it's I babied this jar and I want it
so much and so when they contacted me
and asked if I might be interested I was
like yes yes yes yes because I love this
stuff so I was very very excited now I
have a coupon code that they gave me 25%
off it's a pricey product so I was
really really excited it's down below if
you are interested this is something
that you know you're really investing in
your skin I mean truly because this the
studies that they've done with this
stuff is unbelievable it uses manuka
honey and bee venom which is like rare
in skin care it's like I don't even know
that any other skincare I've ever tried
has this so it's really different
ingredients it's all natural but what I
love about it and I'll show you right
now myself applying it what I love about
it is that it just sinks into the skin
so quickly and it moisturizes it is
anti-aging and I feel like I've been
using this jar now for three three and a
half weeks and my skin is transforming
into what I feel like it looked like
like five years ago when I was like 22
you know what I mean like I feel like it
really is you know I don't have crazy
wrinkles yet I'm there to calm I am sure
but this is like making me feel like I'm
already doing something really amazing
for my skin and I haven't tried a lot of
skincare that's done that for me so I
love that about this it's got a really
nice kind of clean but like honey like
smell I don't really know how to trim it
smells really Pleasant to me and another
big thing and a lot of you guys I'm sure
will understand where I'm coming from a
this stuff really sinks in so quickly to
your skin so I'll use it at night before
bed but I also use it in the morning and
I can put this moisturizer on and its
really really moisturizing but because
it sinks in so quickly I can pretty much
start applying my makeup within like a
minute or two of putting it on so it's
so fast so I don't feel like it's a
moisturizer that I can't use before
makeup because it totally can I feel
like I've tried a lot of really
moisturizing ones but I can't use it the
morning because it takes forever to sink
into the skin like an hour and I'm like
I don't have that kind of time and I
want to use the same thing morning and
night if I can so obviously it's an
investment but it lasts me a long time
and it just has blown me away it is
totally shocked me so like I said that
25% off code is down below they also
have and this is pretty cool
they have a 60-day money back guarantee
so if you try it for some reason you
don't like it they'll give you your
money back and I think that's really
nice because that shows that they're
standing by their product that they
really have faith in the fact that you
will love this cream so I think that's
really neat and it's very rare for
pricey skincare companies to do that and
so it's one of those things that if
you've been thinking about splurging a
nice skincare but you've just been
waiting this would probably be the time
to do it and you know especially knowing
that you could get your running back if
you just didn't like it alright moving
on so let's talk about a product I hated
and I thought I would love this it is
the hourglass ambient light correcting
primer I'm all three of them I've
already declutter too I kept this one to
try a couple more times and this one's
in mood light I tried all three they
don't do anything and you know when I
compare this to kind of got like a tan
beige color to it and you know you blend
it in it just kind of blended away and
then that was that and I thought to
myself this is expensive like it didn't
do anything I don't really know how to
describe it you guys it didn't so pores
it didn't make my skin look either any
of the three didn't make my skin look
like dewy or a little bit smoother it
really I mean maybe it smoothes it a
little bit but considering this
considering our gloss and how many
products that there's I have love I was
shocked at how it affected all three of
these were and I'm seeing
couple other youtubers talk about these
and they've declutter them already you
know they bought it return it pretty
quickly after and hourglass has their
veil mineral primer that is so amazing
it's pore filling so effective and
that's why guess why I thought you know
how does these even hit the shelves
they're just kind of I mean they they're
basically like a not great drugstore
primer there are better drugstore
primers out there so that is why that
one really surprised me but a primer
that surprised me in a good way and that
is really inexpensive is this Catrice
primer this is their prime and fine
beautifying primer this stuff it comes
out kind of like a pink looks like
calamine lotion
but you rub it in and it's moisturizing
I actually really like pairing these
together so I'll put the be enigma one
on up first obviously is moisturizer and
now I'll put the primer on top and it
may just work so well together that my
skin looks so healthy all day long and
right now we're in the midst of winter
and that's kind of that time where your
skin tends to be a little more dry at
least mine does and those two together
look so beautiful but it's really
inexpensive it really does make your
skin look pretty underneath foundation
and I think when you pair this with a
good moisturizer it really shines and
the reason that shocked me is because no
one's been talking about this Catrice is
new to the u.s. it's been in I know in
Europe and just in various countries for
a while but it's new to the US and no
one's really talked about this at all
and it's so nice let's talk about some
lips so I'm I've got some good and some
bad
so first of all the colour-pop lip
liners people always talk about their
eyeshadows and their blushes and their
abyss and that and that but I feel like
no one talks about their lip liners
these are their best products there's so
many expensive I have never tried a lip
liner that works it effectively is this
whether its high-end drugstore Urban
Decay like all those different brands
that people know upper lip liner this is
miles and miles above them this is the
colour-pop lippie pencil inbound it's
all a mess so it's sharpened really
weird I don't know if they all do that
if you have one and it did that let me
know but it's a beautiful color I'm
actually wearing it on the outer part of
my lips today I wear all
time so I love the shade but mostly it's
this lipliner range I need to get like
18,000 more colors because I love this
so much but I feel like it's worth
mentioning because it's really
inexpensive and again I feel like
everything else that colour-pop gets so
much love but their lip liners their
lippies their lip pencils I guess they
call them are the best thing they fell
in my opinion so to go along with that
now this is shocking to me this is a
liquid lipstick that so many people rave
about and I could not wait to get one of
these and then I did and I tried it and
I was so shocked and how much I hated it
this is the Kat Von D liquid lipstick so
many people love this and red is like my
favorite thing to wear on my lips so
this one is in the shade outlaw the
packaging is beautiful I like this kind
of thinner and when you swatch it it's
beautiful it's a thinner formula which
is really really neat it's a beautiful
red but here's the thing guys I wore
this like every other day for like a
week kind of trying it out and every
time I wore it I hated it like it was
kind of it would never look great after
about an hour and I'm like okay most
liquid lipsticks lasts at least a couple
hours looking pretty good it was so
uncomfortable because it was so drying
now the thing is look liquid lipsticks
that it's very typical especially like
in Cheaper liquid lipsticks things like
that but for this one to have such a
cult status and to you know be so
revered by so many people I thought why
is it so drying and so I was just really
disappointed and the reason I'm bringing
this up and I feel okay telling you guys
how much I hated this it's because I
have a liquid lipstick that I'm wearing
today that is miles and miles above it
when it comes to formula and that is the
Oprah liquid lipstick I'm not affiliated
with them at all they did send me a
bunch of theirs but I'm not getting any
kickbacks nothing I love this formula
and so many people have used it for
years I just hadn't I don't I tried it
like last month or maybe a couple months
ago in a subscription box and I thought
this is amazing this stuff is amazing
and then they happen to contact me on my
students perfect this is what I'm
wearing today is called
arms but this formula is so it kind of
is like a whipped formula so it's so
comfortable it like look at the inner
part of my lips that's where I can
always tell oh I'm wearing the liquid
lipstick so with the Kat Von D you know
you can really tell I've worn the red
that they have they've got a couple Reds
and you know comparing this one with
that one side-by-side the Kat Von D one
just like within five minutes the middle
part looked crazy and dry and like you
could really see the difference between
my lips and the liquid lipstick whereas
with it it's so comfortable it almost
feels like you're wearing like today it
feels like I'm wearing a lip balm it's
so comfortable I can't I can't raise
about this stuff enough and they have so
many shades so if you're thinking about
one or the other go for the Oprah one I
was so surprised how much I loved it I
thought it was kind of one of those
things like you're our cosmetics
whatever is like oh everything they feel
is amazing like is it though or is it
because every time you do talking that's
it so but Oprah I mean ever was talking
about like it can't be that good and I
have to put my foot in my mouth because
it is that good and I really just didn't
love the cap on these so surprised on
both ends there I will say as I'm trying
to wipe these off that you think the cap
on Dee has kind of a staining effect
which is nice if that's the kind of
thing you want you know you really
wanted to stay on all day and kind of
stain less so than the Oprah ones do but
again the cap on do you want to I've
already explained it I don't need to
explain in alright so back to good
stuff this I'm going to show you a clip
of me applying today so this is the elf
aqua Beauty duo
it's a blush and bronzer in bronze pink
beige and it's the bronzer that shocked
the heck out of me so with this stuff I
apply it with a stipple brush elf has a
pretty good stipple brush that I'm using
here and I'll just apply it anywhere I
would typically put bronzer slash
contour whatever I'm wearing it today
and I feel like it gives such a
beautiful healthy look to your skin but
it doesn't look powdery so like these
winter months right now that I'm going
through like I said I'll tend to have a
little bit of dry skin around where my
hair is and so with this stuff you know
I don't want to accentuate that at all
so the less powder I'm putting on my
face the better and knowing that this
stuff is so good it stays where it is it
doesn't budge and I feel like it's one
of those things that I just didn't think
I would like that kind of a product like
the Chanel bronze universal stuff that I
also love this is a total dupe for it I
keep mentioning it videos because it's
so amazing and it's so cheap now the
blush is pretty good as well
I just don't tend oh this is just kind
of a bright blush I wish they have this
bronzer in a full pan that would be
amazing
okay so I've got another dud this is the
Stila smudge pot cos elves my favorite
liquid liner it's their sales a liquid
eyeliner I've been out of the for a
while though well I thought since I
loved that liner so much I'm sure
they're gel liner will be awesome to
know this stuff is horrible I can't
explain it right now I finally went out
and bought the l'oreal blackest black
lacquer liner this stuff and I knew I
love this stuff I've had it a million
times in the past this stuff is miles
and miles better than the steel ones and
this evil one is double if not triple
the price depending on to get like a
sale or something oh my gosh like it's
kind of one of those things that no
matter what brush I tried to apply it
with there would always be like a line
with no liner in between if you've ever
experienced that you know what I mean if
you don't I don't know how else to
describe that it's like thick but also
creamy which is not necessarily a bad
thing but it applied so weird and it
never looks as black as I want it to
look and it's kind of separated from the
edges pretty much like a month after I
opened it my plush so I was so
disappointed don't spend your money on
this go get the L'Oreal one the
Maybelline eye studio one is really good
too I think I like the little one a
little better but honestly - both so
that the L'Oreal one is the one I'm
wearing today but the seal one huge pass
I was so surprised at how horrible this
was compared to like their liquid liners
another one from Catrice they're kind of
killing it for me right now because I'm
trying so many new products of theirs
but this is the Catrice smoky matte
powder liner I have never tried a
product like this let me break this down
for you so you open it up it's in the
shade smoky black and it is this little
like not fully but like a little
thin sponge and in there there is like
this smoky black powder and so what I do
and I use some of my lower lashes today
what if I'm putting black in my
waterline after I do that you know if
you only do that in my opinion just
doesn't look right so I like to have
something kind of smudged underneath it
just to kind of blend those together
this is a godsend it is so perfect so
you can just use the sponge and it's
just this kind of smoky line you can
kind of smoke it out I don't typically
use this to do it I would usually use
like a brush but it smokes out so
beautifully it's a powder so it's not
just staying there you've got time to
kind of work with it it is so amazing
even when I'm not putting a liner on my
waterline I'll still use this just to
kind of darken that area just a little
bit so that it all looks a little more
uniform this stuff is amazing I don't
know I doesn't look farther into it like
if they sell other shades or anything
but I've never tried something like this
it was so new to me and just amazing
next thing is this flower beauty endless
wear ultimate eye color whip I tried a
couple products and flower beauty and I
loved them the only thing I'll say is a
lot of them have like a strong floral
scent so if you're sensitive to that or
you don't like floral scents and I'm
talking like actual flowers floral you
would not like a lot of their products
those like their lip glosses have that
scent so much those it is even strong
for me and I ended up getting rid of a
lot of it but this one surprised me
because I had heard decent things about
these it's in the shade sheer sand and
it's kind of like one of those powder
creamy kinds of things there's just a
little bit and it's a pretty color but
the thing is it's all dried out I could
it pops right out of there and here's
the thing and I love you flower beauty
but they sent this to me and it came
like this so I'm like guys and I'm sure
I mean obviously they weren't opening
the packaging and checking but you know
it's kind of one of those things that
just disappointing their packaging is so
beautiful I love some of their brushes
like actually I'm using a lot of their
brush
now my favorite eyeliner brush is a
flower beauty one these white-handled
ones are amazing this is the eyeliner
brush that I love and this fluffy want
to use on my lid every single day so
they make good products but this one's
just really disappointed I don't know if
it was a dud I mean I hope so but I mean
it just didn't have a lot of payoff it's
okay but the fact that it's all dried
out and stuff it was just kind of
surprising I was like really I mean this
is still a newer line they've got you
know they sent it to me with all these
like rose petals and it was so beautiful
but I was so disappointing okay next
thing really surprised me this is the
L'Oreal visible lift blur foundation no
one's talking about this and it is so
good it's like this whipped moussey
foundation this has like a gray tone to
it so you've got neutral skin or you
want to neutralize your skin this is
amazing for that that's kind of what I
realized I do like having that as an
option so when my skin is really kind of
just reddish and I don't want to put on
like a warm toned you know something
this is so nice for me to kind of just
neutralize my skin this isn't a shade
2:04 creamy natural it is this beautiful
like I said almost whip foundation and
it just makes your skin look so nice
and like I said it shocked me because no
one's been talking about this and it's
been out for quite a while I have their
concealer as well that I like and it's
like a big tube of concealer I'm never
going around of it but the foundation is
really what blew me away I've been using
this for a couple months and I really do
feel like it just really evens out my
skin tone it's got nice coverage it's
comfortable to wear it doesn't highlight
dry patches so I judge this is one of
those things that it says it is going
blurred lines wrinkles smooth skin I
will agree that it makes your skin look
really smooth I don't know about like
blurring wrinkles and lines and stuff
like that but I really like the
foundation and it's one of those that it
was so surprising because kind of hidden
in the drugstore I never noticed it but
it's worth checking out for sure so the
next product I'm going to mention is
very new to me but it is so effective
that I couldn't end this video without
talking about it I just filmed today a
demo using this but this is the milk
makeup blur stick it's one shade but
it's transparent enough that it doesn't
really
it's not like it goes on this shade if
that makes sense you put this on just
all over anywhere you've got Coors or
fine lines that you want to kind of fill
in and the claim is that it will blur
all of that and then you can put your
foundation or whatever on top of it or
you can wear it alone now for me it's
not it doesn't have any coverage or
anything like that so I'm typically not
gonna wear this alone but kind of as a
replacement for a primer is how I've
been using it and my nose I've got such
pores I use this today I love this stuff
and again I used it on top of the V
enigma if I know you bring it up but
it's so good I use it on top of that
stuff today it did such a great job of
blurring my pores and it worked well
with a moisturizer which is good because
that was kind of my concern is you know
is it going to rub a with your eyes
around but it doesn't and you don't even
really need to blend it in and all it's
such a thin layer but what I love about
it is I'll put some base foundation on
top and it just looks flawless I mean I
feel like my foundation today looks
really nice and I'm especially looking
at my nose where I've always got issues
of my nose I've always had issues at
this pores and I feel like this is like
my Saviour my saving grace it's one of
the only blurring kinds of things that
actually does what it says so now you
know now that I'm seeing about it I
haven't tried this with the visible list
blur I'm curious if those together would
be like the most blurry I would just
look like a blurry image but anyway so I
was very very surprised because I
thought it was kind of gimmicky and that
you know a lot of people on YouTube were
talking about him all of all but I was
very surprised at how much I loved it
and how well it works
so hopefully you enjoyed the video again
