gonna be doing kind of a Q&amp;amp;A and I'm
just pulling from a lot of my social
media so I put a little snap out on
snapchat I wanted to do this video
because I've been very blessed with a
lot of new subscribers lately and I'm so
excited that you guys are kind of a part
of this family and I really I view it as
a family like you guys are some of the
best most supportive friends that I have
so I'm just I'm just tickled to death
that there are more of you so let's go
ahead and get into it so this one is
from Rosie Annette sorry we just
recently talked about we're going to
Disney we know for sure once this year
but we're pretty sure twice you know
just want I could go ten times anyway
but yes if you didn't know we're total
Disney nuts and I know there are a lot
of us out there and then there's a lot
of people that are like what like why do
you care about Disney but um so Disney
runs we would love to do one one day
because first of all the medals you get
are like amazing but they are so
expensive so we have been doing the mini
marathon here in Indianapolis where we
live so like we're doing that again this
year but we're wanting to both work up
to do that there because we can do a
minute the mini marathons a half
marathon that we run so we could totally
do those in Disney and Tyler wants to do
the ones where it's like the challenges
where you do like a 5k 10k a half
marathon and a full marathon the white
no way dude I can do the first three
that's about it but so we're definitely
looking into that but we need to like
save up for that because it's very
expensive
plus they sell out but um also favorite
Disney ride oh my gosh I it's hard for
me even pick a favorite park out of like
Disney World with Magic Kingdom Epcot
Animal Kingdom in Hollywood studios but
I'm Splash Mountain really is one of my
favorites cuz you don't really get that
wet I mean sometimes you'd be like
randomly I feel like people get soaked
but I've never really gotten that one
where it's uncomfortable but I I just
love swatch mountain the smell of the
ride and the music and like everyone's
want to come on shuffle from my phone
the Splash Mountain like medley and it
just puts me in the best mood and it's
just so nostalgic Disneyworld to me like
forever so I don't know something about
that ride I love but there's so many
like I could go on forever oh and I also
love like the dark rides like Pirates of
the Caribbean or oh my gosh the People
Mover in Tomorrowland Tyler and I love
the People Mover where it's like that
little monorail above Tomorrowland where
you can kind of see everything and it
goes inside Space Mountain and we did
once ride that when Space Mountain the
lights were on and there because if you
didn't know it's like a completely dark
ride indoors but the lights ron's you
could actually see the track and it was
so cool I know he filmed some I don't
know if he's gonna upload that on his
channel or not but it was awesome that
was an awesome question put me in a
great mood this next one is from Lily
character sweating looks so comfy so
that is an awesome question we know
we're gonna be going to Disney at least
once maybe twice this year I'm so
excited about but we're also going on a
cruise coming during my spring break so
I'm very excited on my cruise isn't that
I mean feel like everyone goes on cruise
all the time I've never been on one so I
I don't know how that's happen I've
traveled so much but I've never been on
a cruise so we're going to like all the
classics like I don't even know where
Tyler knows all the ports of call Tyler
okay anyway so we're going to like I
know we're going to Jamaica and Cozumel
and like a bunch of different places
like that so I am just so excited and
excited to plan that a little bit more
like with the short excursions but our
brother my brother-in-law Tyler's
brother actually just left for Australia
and he'll be living and working there
for an entire year so ideally we could
visit him there but that is so much more
expensive so we'll see if that's in the
cards for this year or not I'm not sure
that it
because I am paying a lot of student
loans off so that's taken it you know we
save for travel and it's Tyler's job as
well so I mean it's it's almost like a
business expense for him as well you
know like research and I know it sounds
silly but it it is so we'll see but I
just so excited for this year this one
is from Morgan Friday oh thank you
that's a good question well we both run
a lot of course I'm saying that and I
haven't run in like two weeks because it
has been so old and just so blah but
anyway um he we both have been doing a
lot of kettlebell stuff lately and
that's it's kind of like the year of the
kettlebell for us cuz we've gotten
really really into it and it's great
because most of the most of it is cardio
plus strength training so you're kind of
getting all of it at the same time which
we like because it's like more bang for
your buck timewise and effort wise but
we both you know when we go to the gym
I'll usually run for a little bit and
then I don't know there's you some
machines I'll do some Pilates on a mat
usually I don't do a lot with machines I
usually am doing like yoga or pilates or
just different little exercises on a mat
what's helped me a lot is that when I
went to school for theater we had like
conditioning classes where we learned a
lot of workouts that you can do with no
gym membership no weights no money for
anything things you can do with just
yourself and gravity so that has helped
me a lot and I just have those kind of
implanted in my brain so I can just
switch them off but we're also big fans
of YouTube and different videos on there
just to switch things up so that's one
thing I would recommend there's so many
amazing you know you can do a 10-minute
workout and search for that there's just
tons this one is from fafa betta
okay well I I just what my first like
experience with makeup other than like
watching my mom put on her makeup I
remember being in like six or seventh
grade and we I was in a play and I
really wasn't into theater but I was
doing excited and want to do sports and
so I remember being in a play and we
were backstage and I saw all the you
know eighth-grade girls who were older
than me putting on like blue eyeshadow
and I was like wow like that is so cool
so I remember like my mom got me some
for the play you know and so I just
remember putting just blue eyeshadow
everywhere and I swear for like two
years I thought oh when you're in a show
you wear blue eyeshadow I'm not even
it's so cute thinking back that's
hilarious and I've never really voiced
that but that is exactly what I thought
oh if you're gonna show you wear blue
eyeshadow of course in red lipstick and
that's just what you do so that's what I
did for a couple years but um I remember
really being into just like white
eyeliner and just like putting it all
over your lid I was like this is so cool
and nothing else I mean that was it in
middle school so I was kind of my first
foray into this but then when I got to
high school I started really liking it
and when I was like in show choir and
drama club and all the shows I would
learn from like people that actually
knew what they were doing they would
show us how to apply certain things and
then in college taking stage makeup
classes and learning even more about
shadow and light in the actual art of it
so I'm still no makeup artist don't get
it twisted but but you know I have
learned a thing or two cutter is low
this next one's from Melissa Gio 95 she
has the most beautiful beauty mark oh my
gosh okay
so teacher I'm excited that you're
becoming a teacher Melissa we need more
of you um I think my favorite thing is
everyone smile a look out I feel like
I've talked about this before I don't
know if I talk with you guys about it
though but one of my favorite things is
when I'm looking out and I'm maybe I'm
feeling stressed in the moment because
you know there's like a lot of chatter
but I'll kind of walk around and I'll
realize that they're all talking but
they're all talking about what we're
doing and
single kid in there is engaged in what
we're doing and that is the most
powerful most exciting thing because not
only does it mean I got them pumped up
and excited about it but it means that
they're truly learning and they're
learning by socialising and there's
nothing wrong with that and I think as a
teacher what can be hard is you know
I'll look down the hall or walk by a
classroom and you know there are certain
classes in my school that they're just
silent 100% of the time
I shouldn't say I've never said but it's
just so quiet and I feel like I'm like
oh well I must not be in control of my
class if mine is not always just super
quiet but then I remember these moments
where I'm looking around or walking
around and realizing oh my gosh like all
30 of my students are actually engaged
in what they're doing and they're
talking but they're talking about the
material and that is so exciting there's
a million things I could say but that's
just one that popped in my head next one
is from Shelby Conrad 98 okay
you guys are made fun of you and I tell
you this maybe you want you can if you
want to when I before I did YouTube I
would do and I bet I am not the only one
that does this or did this I should say
but I would like by probably you know
say I'm going to do a haul like I would
go to Walgreens or CVS and get like a
couple new makeup products and I would
whether I'm in my car or maybe I just be
at home and when no one was around I
would like pretend to be filming and
like talk about the products but there
was no camera filming and I was totally
an adult like in my 20s so it's not you
know I wasn't like really young no I was
an adult doing this but and I I just
loved doing that and what I'm trying not
to forget as I'm doing this in my third
year is you know there's some times
where I'm tired or I'm just having a bad
week and I'm like you know I only have a
certain amount of time that I can film
within a week period and knowing that
it's really hard if I'm not in the right
mood to film and usually you guys see
right through your saying you know
you're not you're not are you okay you
know what I mean but just remembering
those moments back to when I would love
doing it for for no camera I just liked
talking about them to know
so you know getting in that mindset and
reminding myself of that I think really
helps because I am so lucky that I get
to talk about all this done looking at
makeup down here because I just fell in
another of my January favorites but I
get to talk to you guys about all these
little goodies and I get to show you
what they look like and all these things
I used to do for no reason at all I get
to do for a purpose for you guys to
learn about them too and for you guys to
comment below and let me know about
stuff and I just love that and I love
knowing that at any point I can you know
hop on my YouTube or on one of my social
medias and I can talk to you guys or I
can read some uplifting words and you
guys are just wonderful so there's a lot
of favorite parts but I think that's my
favorite part kind of like I'm really am
fulfilling a dream of something I I love
doing beforehand - that makes sense
Pinocchio's you get been over there
Tyler must be playing with him are you
sleeping in barking alright this next
one is from Brittany may you - no no I
it's funny cuz I get a lot of questions
about our relationship but then I get a
lot of comments from people saying you
know I don't want to hear about your
let's shove like oh okay so it's always
mixed and that's okay it's kind of to be
expected but um I don't know I think my
advice would be you just know period but
I don't necessarily believe that there's
just one soulmate for you I I'm
RELIGIOUS and I know that always you
know strikes the chord with people
positive negatively you know it is what
it is but for me and what I believe not
saying you need to believe it but what I
believe is just that you know there is a
bigger plan and that my sister put it
perfectly the other day she said it says
if every little event in your life is
like just a piece of the puzzle and um
you know I just feel like you just know
when you've met the one and it just it's
like suddenly everything clicks and you
I don't know I don't know how else to
describe it like that there was no big
moment there is no fanfare
it was just there's a song from a
musical called Fiorello
I wonder if I can find it it is the most
beautiful oh it's called when did I fall
in love and she's she's saying when did
I fall in love what night which day when
did I first begin to feel this way and
she's just talking about you know where
is the crashing Court where is that you
know there was no big moment but I I'm
suddenly realizing I am in love with
this guy it's so beautiful
I get the goose I love that musical so
much and I love that song if you don't
know it when did I fall in love that's
what it's called
that's from Fiorello the musical based
on Fiorello LaGuardia anyway so I think
that's just it it's just tons of little
moments and you just know and I think
back to relationships I've had that were
really long that you know I almost
married another guy and I remember
having so much doubt and with Tyler I I
never had that doubt there was never
there might have been doubt of you know
or are we you know how much longer are
we gonna wait till we get married or you
know things like that but there was
never doubt about him being the one I
wanted to be with forever ever I've
never had doubt but I remember in that
other relationship and other
relationships there'd be constant doubt
and I think it was never huge doubt
where I'm like oh you know but it was
just small little things that would make
me doubt and as I look back now on the
other side of it I realized there was a
reason if you're having doubt there
might be a reason it's not just say
you're you're if you've had down and you
still got married you're with the wrong
person because you can still have doubt
but I just think that if it's a lot of
doubt or even if it's little moments but
it's like all the time
you might want to really think about why
are you having that doubt there's got to
be some reason and maybe it's just
something about you maybe it isn't him
just something you need to work on with
yourself I don't know but anyway Wow
tangent whoa okay let's do one more
because this video is gonna be 10 miles
long that doesn't make sense
10 miles long it's this one is from yo
its M dog
Thanks um affordable i shadow brand I
think I'm gonna have to say L'Oreal
because they I love their palette 'la
palette 1 but I feel mix is pretty good
too though but sometimes NYX can be
really powder y'all know something but
why cover I like then I like their their
roses palette Maybelline I like to see I
like them all but L'Oreal is the first
one that stands out that I've tried some
singles I've tried some of their own
palettes and I we just really like it
and maybe it's because they do a lot of
neutrals and I just love neutrals
obviously alright one more
this one's from Taylor Eva Lena
well I've already answered that but I'm
so glad that Disney is your life yes and
that like I feel like it's such a silly
thing because you can't complain about
it cuz it's like alright my dad is like
group texting me like crazy
you can't possibly use everything
especially when you you know whether
you're youtuber or maybe you just love
makeup if you're watching this you're
probably do and you might be you know
expanding a lot as she said and so I
feel like it just it gets overwhelming
in the weirdest way and so much so that
it almost like floods out into the rest
of my life where you know you guys know
I've decluttered my closet so much that
I went from like a hundred shirts to
like 30 and but I love it and it's so
refreshing and I want to do the same
I've decluttered my collection I've
gotten rid of so much but the thing is
every week I'm getting new packages in
from different companies so you know I
try some out some of them if I know
right off the bat
I might pass on to my sister but you
know you can all you only have one face
and so I think what I'm kind of starting
to steer towards is having just like my
makeup drawer right there of just
products that I'm gonna personally use
have a couple drawers of things I'm
wanting to review soon and decide if I
want to keep in my small curated
collection and if not it goes and I'm
almost thinking that having all of these
drawers because you can't sieve it down
below here and here I have two more
drawer systems like that but shorter I
think having all this space for storage
is almost a curse now because I'm like
well I'm you know we'll find you rid of
all this stuff what am I going to put in
these drawers and I don't want to get
rid of the drawers but I'm realizing you
know I can repurpose these to be you
know they could go in our garage and I
could put other things in them you know
we could use them for tools there's so
many things we can use to repurpose them
and I think sometimes having tons of
storage makes you feel like you need to
fill the things and you don't so again
another tangent but it is overwhelming
and I it's a weird problem but if you
know what we mean then you do and if you
don't then you just don't I don't know
so that's vomiting it's I could do this
all night I swear but I gotta sell it at
some point but let me know if you
enjoyed this video if you liked q and
A's I love just talking to you guys I
feel like so I don't know it's like it
makes me feel like I really am talking
to you and I do these kinds of videos so
let me know down below if you have any
other questions I might be able to
answer them in my next Q&amp;amp;A that I do
hopefully like I would love to do them
every month let me know what you think
it is every month too often maybe I
don't know I also I've done like a live
video once before and it was so much fun
because you guys could go on but it was
so hard to like see who was commenting
it's very confusing if you've ever been
a part of one but I'd love to do that
again so let me know if that be
something you guys would be interested
in as well so other than that I will
sign off but hopefully you enjoyed and I
will catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
