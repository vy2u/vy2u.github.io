gonna do a just quick Q&amp;amp;A it's been a
while since I've done one of these I try
not to make them too long and they end
up being an hour but this time
Tyler's downstairs making dinner for us
which is really awesome and I got a
sleepy puppy next to me and it's getting
late but I figure I haven't done one in
a while and I just want to talk to you
guys so I asked on Twitter I just left
it on Twitter this time I gotta spend
Twitter for some questions you guys have
so the first one I got is from Ali and
she asks what Netflix shows her am i
watching I'm gonna be honest we have we
cancelled cable finally and it was so
liberating sounds like we don't watch it
like it's wasted money hands up in the
air high-five down in the comments if
you don't have cable because you don't
need it with Netflix we pay for and Hulu
I'm like those together are still way
cheaper than a cable bill and it's like
all the shows I actually want to watch
and i can watch them when I want and you
know anyway I'm over explaining to a
generation of people that I know
probably totally good anyway Netflix
shows i watch we watch stranger things
and we watch it kind of freaks me out
but like a scaredy cat we watched fuller
house yes in all its cheesy glory we own
like the box set I think I got that for
Christmas for Tyler last year the box
set up oh no it was his birthday a full
house and so we re watched the whole
series and then we started watching
fuller house and it's even cheesier than
the original show let's talk to my
sister about this today but regardless
it's it's so good in the dumbest way so
for us we totally love it we totally
geek out on even though it's terrible
and wonderful um what other shows to me
watch we watch I don't know what's on I
don't know what's on Netflix versus you
anyway
so we also watch Brooklyn nine-nine
we watched I watched the Mindy project
he kind of dropped off and I think it's
now done but that one's on Hulu um what
else do we watch I've tried to get into
shameless I've only watched like one and
although that's like Showtime isn't it
I've watched like one episode a lot you
guys tell me I look like I mean raw so
much I'm like that is the biggest
compliment ever I don't really see it
but I'm like I will take the compliment
thank you anyway but I need to like
actually get into that I also tried to
watch Mad Men and I'm only like four
episodes in like does it pick up the
pace I don't know I watched house of car
now I'm curious to see what they do it
would do with it with all this Kevin
Spacey drama and I'm cutting him from it
I'm very curious I could see how it
would actually work to cut him from it
if you've seen all the way through
anyway I have mixed feelings about that
show anyway I feel like we watch a lot
but like comedy wise we like Brooklyn
nine-nine the Mindy project It's Always
Sunny in Philadelphia
is a good one Oh Bob's Burgers is our
favorite show of all time
Family Guy we watch on and off things
like that but yeah next question do I
need to change our battery ah is the
Laura asked is the Loreal sponge better
than the Real Techniques sponge yes yes
yes yes yes yes that L'Oreal sponge is
the best of that and the flower review
you want are neck and neck
I think the L'Oreal one does a little
bit better of a job of actually
spreading on my face and making it look
flawless like the Beauty Blender I feel
like and I keep buying Beauty blenders
and I really need to stop because I
really am realizing the Loreal one is
better I reach for it more often I'm
having to clean it all the time it's
half the price it just does a better job
of spreading it all over your skin and
not looking streaky and not also like
soaking up so much of the foundation
that it you might as well not even put
it on if that makes sense so so that was
with versus the Beauty Blender but same
with the Real Techniques I feel like
they did something the Real Techniques
sponge and made it different and I don't
know what it is because I don't have my
old original one and I wish I did
because it's so much better the one I
have now I don't know it's I feel like
it's weird and different so it's not
terrible but I would totally recommend
the L'Oreal one over that if you haven't
bought one what is my favorite place to
travel to I okay well Disney we go to
Disney World all the time duh but beyond
Disney like I loved Barcelona when we
were there this house summer it was so
awesome I also like going to Chicago I
used to live there and I love like this
last time we went was I think around the
holidays last year we usually go like in
December and town I would say I think we
stayed there longer like my family was
with us for part of it anyway we tried
all these new restaurants and it was we
just had such a fun time I love that
city when's the next time
Tylar are going to Disney I think we're
going well I know we're going in late
December and I'm very very excited
Isabella asked how is your school you're
going and how is your class this year
it's going awesome late and my class is
awesome as they always are I really am
lucky I've got great families great kids
and I mean all kids are great but you
guys know what I mean they're just
they're sweet and you know I have a
couple Rascals but they're sweet so it
you know what I mean you kind of get
beyond it and they're they're all just I
feel like they care about school I mean
obviously we all have certain feelings
about school but you know I feel like I
could still get them involved in things
that maybe they wouldn't have cared
about before which is what I love about
teaching and I just love it this is
definitely I feel like every year I
teach it's only my fourth year teaching
I feel like every year a teach I love it
more and more and more and it's just
awesome I feel very very blessed to be
where I am
I've got awesome coworkers and I just
love it mm-hmm Cara asked what are my
holiday plans we usually do stuff with
both sides of the family like my side
and then Tyler so we're still like I
feel like the families are all still
settling on how because you know we've
got grandkids now on a lot of the sides
and trying to juggle like can one family
have like a certain time it's so hard
yeah I mean most of you guys know
because you probably go through the same
thing but dealing with how do we want to
do like Christmas with this family and
this moment and still have our own you
know what I mean so I know my parents
usually will do a Christmas Eve thing
they've kind of started doing that and
so the bronze side Tyler side we're
figuring that out because a lot of times
we've been out of town and they've been
out of town so I'm excited to have
Christmas at home in our very first home
together
that's exciting I'm excited to decorate
and we always were like cheapos and we
always buy things like after the holiday
so like we have a decent amount
Christmas stuff but I always get excited
for it after Christmas when everything
is on clearance and you can buy awesome
decor for like really cheap we just did
that for like Halloween and fall decor
we just bought like a ton of stuff at
70% off it was awesome so it's totally
the way to do it and if you have a big
lots near you I don't have one near near
me but I used to be near one
and they have amazing to court today
they've amazing decor for really cheap
Sarah Kate hey Sarah I love your channel
she said what's your favorite Christmas
movie um I would have to say okay it's
like a three-way time home alone well
home alone one and two tied for first
they always will be but close seconds
our elf and the Santa Claus I love this
and I love all the movies but the
original Santa Clause is also one of my
favorites so it's like those three I
feel like I always have to watch or at
least have on in the background while
I'm at a little cooking whatever during
December because I love them so much
Kristen asked as a fellow teacher how do
you manage to find time to be both
successful in your career and on YouTube
still working on both do nothin and uh
um I will say this there are times like
most of you guys know that with working
a full-time job I thought I'd be able to
find the time like after work to freshen
up and film a video it's just not
happening like I thought it would I've
literally not done at the single time
because by the time I get home from work
most of you guys know when you get home
from work you're tired you want to eat a
snack you want to relax you want to
unwind and while I love filming it's
just not something I'm dying to do right
when I get home from work and then when
it's later in the night then I'm even
more tired you know what I mean and I
want to spend time with Tyler and
Pinocchio oh um so with that being said
I film on the weekends most you guys
know that and I feel like it can be hard
because I sit down and it's this is not
me complaining I'm being honest with you
guys I just I feel like I'll sit down
and it can be really taxing to film five
or six videos and do close-ups and make
sure my face looks decent half the time
you know and I like to change outfits so
that you guys don't feel like you're
staring at the same outfit all the time
and I hope you don't feel like I'm like
trying to lie to you it was actually
your guys's recommendation for me to
just change videos or change shirts like
every two videos I film so at least it's
a little bit different anyway so long
story short it can be very tiring but to
me they're both important to me so I
make the time and I make myself do it
and so throughout the week I'm editing
I can and you know some weeks are better
than others you know I don't have a set
schedule because I know the second I do
that I'm gonna feel overwhelmed and not
want to do it YouTube still is fun to me
so even though it can be extra work it's
still fun to me it's the same thing
teaching it's extra work but it's so fun
to me so I'm like why I quit one or the
other while they're both still enjoyable
so that's kind of where I'm at do I ever
think I would do YouTube full-time I
know a lot of people ask that I just
don't know like I know I could I would I
know that the second I quit and only did
YouTube I'd be able to get videos up
five days a week I you know but I also
know myself and know that I would go
crazy being at home all the time I just
don't know that it's in my blood to be
able to do that I I don't know and maybe
I'm saying this and maybe in a few years
I will be doing a full time and I'll be
like oh my gosh I love it I can't
imagine doing it any other way it's
something that I juggle in my mind all
the time all the time so who knows what
the future will bring Cassie ass house
the new house is Pinocchio loving having
a yard yes he is he he just runs around
he mostly just sniffs around let's be
real he's a beagle but he just loves it
and he loves barking at the squirrels
and the Ducks and it just makes my heart
happy just watching him happily chaunce
around the yard with his ears flopping
around I love that don't you so much
anyway
but the new house is great we both kind
of feel like he's got his office I've
got mine and it's so nice to have a
space to create as cheesy as it sounds
but it is and it's nice for him to have
a space I mean he really genuinely works
from home so his office he needs to have
he needs to have that place to organize
files and you know all that stuff so I'm
so thankful this house has room enough
for that as well and we just kind of
feel like we're getting settled a lot of
our rooms are done essentially the only
room we really haven't done much with is
the basement like we've created a
workout room down there and some storage
and stuff but we need a couch and we
want a TV down there but that's kind of
all stuff that we're like we already
have TVs and couches and other rooms
that we use so it's not that big of a
deal it's not a rush but in the future
that's something we're kind of looking
towards doing eventually so Katie asked
what's number one on your bucket list
and what is your favorite part of being
married bucket list I want to go
someplace that I'm so uncomfortable
because it scares me like
being in Paris was so much fun because I
was uncomfortable cuz I didn't speak the
language but looking back I'm like I'm
so glad I did it you know what I mean
so I want to go someplace that I really
would be uncomfortable not a European
city but like Thailand or somewhere that
it's such a culture shock that it would
I don't know like forced me to get out
of my shell in that way because I love
to travel but certain things really do
make me nervous
long long flights make me incredibly
nervous not speaking the language and
being able to communicate I hate I just
don't like that part of traveling but I
know it's good for me and so I feel like
that's just kind of one of those things
that's just in my brain
favorite part about being married I
don't know like some morning and it'll
get me all teary-eyed but like we've had
a rough week um just in our family and
Nesi now I'm getting emotional um we've
had a very rough really few weeks
there's been medical issues for me
there's been issues with dogs in our
life and a dog that had to be abruptly
put to sleep and like Tyler's had issues
we oh my gosh like so many things in our
life not his come crashing down but just
a lot of stuff um and like little things
like this morning I woke up and like it
was just really early earlier than I
needed to be up and so I kind of I
couldn't fall back asleep so I grabbed
my phone and I was just checking my
email and I just felt Tyler kind of
grabbed his hand just kind of reached
over and just kind of held my hand and I
don't know what it was about that and if
you're married and happy I hope you guys
are it's just those little things that
are so dumb like it's so dumb but like
for whatever reason it just like sent
butterflies in my stomach everywhere you
know it made no sense but you guys get
it and um I always cry in these videos I
don't know why but I'm just so thankful
and even though you know we can have
those times like today we never really
like fight fight but like we'll get just
tiffy with each other we both got
actually just a couple days ago we both
got new iPhones and we're trying to set
it up with the online chat and like he's
still setting it up and he's like and
I'm like well Tyler you've got to be
ready she wants you to turn off your
phone so she can activate it
from wherever she is and he's like well
I'm still doing this I'm and like those
little things like they're so dumb and
then like we're done and we're like I'm
sorry I'm sorry and we're just like that
was so dumb so I'm thankful for that too
that we can kind of realize that those
little dumb Tiff's so we're just like
with each other are exactly that dumb
then you move on and they meant
literally nothing anyway tangent Alert
Palin asked what is your Hogwarts house
ravenclaw that kind of surprised me but
then as I thought about like yeah that
checks out ravenclaw I think Tyler's was
um house at Hogwarts what is Gryffindor
and he's like proud as a peacock about
it being Gryffindor anyway and then
Caitlyn also asked who are my favorite
musicians or music lovers I love Lord I
love her like I don't know what it is
about her I watch all of her music
videos like more than once and I never I
really just don't watch music videos I
love her I love her music I love like
the way she thinks and writes it's just
so different but I she's one of those
people that like I want to meet I feel
like I'd be friends with her I love okay
some of my favorite songs of hers the
Louvre I love I love perfect places oh
my gosh I could name like I literally
have not heard a Lauren song I don't
like super cut I love she's so good
she's probably my favorite I also love
John Mayer he went through some weird
dips with albums that I didn't love like
there'd be a song or two I liked but
just generally I really do like his
music and he's kind of getting back to
what he used to do and I'm happy about
that
um who else do I love and I mean like I
love Taylor Swift there are other like I
listened to all kinds of music but just
like my deep my deep tracks are like a
board that really is what really gets to
me I went through faced a long time ago
where I really liked ska music and I'll
never be able to explain it but like I
was really into it anyway uh awesome
question Whitney asks what are your
visions for your channel in 2018 I am
really and I'm kind of starting it now
I'm branching out I'm trying to do
videos that are
different whether it's a video I saw
someone else do and I'm like I want to
try that that's new that's fresh and I
really liked it and then just giving him
a shout out I've already filmed like two
or three recently where it was literally
a video I saw another youtuber do and I
loved the idea
so I shouted them out and said this is
their video go check it out because a
that gives exposure to other channels
which i think is really cool but B it's
just something fresh I feel like a lot
of the things on YouTube are stale I
stopped doing subscription box videos as
much because I thought they were just
getting kind of stale and so just kind
of keeping it fresh and new and I don't
know just trying new different products
I feel like I've gotten into a rut where
I was only trying products from brands
that I knew and trusted but there's so
much out there that it's like why try
some other stuff give some airtime to
brands that no one's talking about and
so that's kind of my vision it's just a
fresh new year lots of new content new
brands and just stuff that's not
necessarily only the things that are not
that I'm not going to talk about brands
that are popular I will and also review
but also giving that extra time to other
brands and so I'm really excited about
that portion of it re pretty name or
area but I think it's re asked what are
some things about teaching you wish
people know sub plants take forever I
wish people knew how much time it is
behind the scenes and I know people talk
about it but people that aren't teachers
or that don't know teachers personally
like I know some people have parents
that are teachers but people outside of
that realm I don't think they get how
much time it takes and then energy all
day long you're teaching you're not
sitting behind your net you are up and
teaching and doing small groups and
doing conferences and doing I mean
you're never resting and I think people
can say from their ivory tower Oh
teachers deserve to get paid more but
I'm like no teachers deserve to get paid
more like it's so much more work like a
Tyler used to work in a cubicle and he
would say and he made you know more than
I did teaching and he would say you know
it's it's terrible like I go to the ED
he quit he hated that job you know there
was nothing wrong with the company he
worked for it was just
the office shot he just couldn't do it
and he'd say you know I go into work I
do my job the best as I can and then I
leave and I don't think about work
whereas with teaching you go home and
you think about those kids you're
thinking how can i how could i rearrange
my seating chart to help these talking
and kids stop talking or or you know i
wonder what's going on at home with this
kid why stephen so offer you know how
can I help this one kid learn how to
study or huh you know all these things
that go on in your head you can't just
leave it and you know I I have I will
say one thing I'm proud of is I have
drawn a line in the sand and I do not
work for teaching at home I do check my
email and I still respond to parents on
there just because I know if I were a
parent and it were like 8 p.m. and I'm
like wait is this actually dude like I
don't know I would want a response so
that is one thing I do do that not
everyone does but I don't grade papers
at home anymore I don't plan at home I
don't bring any of it home and I know a
lot of my co-workers do and I'm just
like you know what I'm not paid enough
to do that to be quite candid but also I
get my job done I get the grading done
in time I just make sure I'm doing it
within work hours after school or before
school or during prep because like I
said I don't think it's fair for me to
take it home when I'm like I don't know
anyway not do there's anything wrong I
know a lot of people do that it's not
what I'm saying but for me I'm like for
me to also have YouTube is a full-time
job I have to draw a line somewhere so
that's kind of what I do Savannah asked
favorite thing about being a youtuber
and least favorite thing my favorite
thing is that I get to do what I used to
do in my car for no one and like I would
literally sit in my car and I'd buy like
two lip products from CBS this is before
I had a channel and I would sit there
and I know some of you guys are gonna be
like I do that oh my gosh I do that and
if you do this you should start a
channel I would sit in my car and like
be at a stoplight and I'd be like I
think so just bought this new concealer
from Ulta um I have it in the shade
light um I really like that it's got a
dope like I would genuinely be filming a
fake video for absolutely no it and I'm
sure the people around me at the stop
light real like what in the heck is she
doing that's why I used to do or I would
do it in my art are I do it in my head
but like in my bedroom I'd be like
that you pace melted like I didn't want
my parents to hear cuz I'd be
embarrassing anyway I used to do that
and so I love that now I get to do it
for you guys and like it's not fake it
does feel different I will say it was
almost more fun to do it pretend that
sounds terrible
anyway it's just different my least
favorite thing however is feeling and
this is like a deep cut again feeling
like I always have to look perfect on
camera first of all I never look perfect
but like what that's one thing maybe
another like 2018 idea I want to break
free from feeling like of course this
shirt looks crazy as I'm saying this but
I want to break free from feeling like I
have to look 100 percent perfect in a
outfit you've never seen with the
perfect jewelry and my hair's got to
look perfect I want to break free from
that because hey it's not realistic B I
end up spending way too much time
getting ready and not enough time
filming I'd rather be talking to you
guys than doing that and I just feel
like I don't member who I heard recently
talking about this but I really it
really resonated with me just that
feeling like if you do film videos or
whatever I'm like real life is real and
my favorite youtubers are real and they
look real and they are honest of course
but they don't always feel like they
need to look perfect and so I really I
feel like I've got to break that feeling
of like I'd be wearing like a really fun
t-shirt and I've got oh I got to change
out of this and wear a v-neck with a
cute necklace for the video it's like
why wear the cute t-shirt showed to you
guys cuz you might be interested in it
and it's okay to be wearing a freaking
t-shirt so I really want to shake that
and be even more real with you guys I
guess is what I'm saying um so yeah
that's another kind of goal of mine but
it's like my least favorite part that
I'm gonna just kind of change and turn
it around on its head and take charge um
so that's all the questions of the
answer tonight I think dinner's almost
ready and I'm like frickin ravenous but
I hope you enjoyed it I will link my
most recent QA I don't know when that
was but I will link it below I'm so
