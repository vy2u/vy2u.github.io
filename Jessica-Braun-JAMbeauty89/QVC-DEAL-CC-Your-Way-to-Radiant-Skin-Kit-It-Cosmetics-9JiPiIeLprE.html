I know you're probably like another it
cosmetics video seriously you're just
sponsored by them no I am totally not
sponsored by them they have been sending
me brand new makeup just recently and
it's for me to do whatever I want with
that's something that comes with the
beauty bloggers and vloggers industry is
that sometimes companies will send you
things to review so no they're not
paying me anything to say any of this I
don't have to show any of this but I'm
choosing to so today I'm sharing with
you the this new line that are not lying
I guess it's like a kit that QVC will be
selling as they're like special value
very very soon I'm not sure when this
video will be up but I know that it's
launching on Friday March 27 so
depending on when you're watching this
that's what it is
and I think it's launches at like
midnight I was trying to read the paper
that comes with it was kind of confusing
to be honest but anyway regardless the
kit is called CC plus you're way too
radiant skin so the idea is that all of
these products in this kit will make
your skin more radiance which you know
at this time of year in the spring I
mean that's kind of what everyone's
looking for I actually just did a haul
of all the things they had sent me just
from their regular like not a kit or
anything just from their makeup line so
I can link that video below if you're
interested just to see that regular
stuff but this is specific to this kit
so the first thing in here is this CC
plus illumination now I involved this
just the regular CC cream and I have it
in fair because I'm very fair now I've
already glanced and this is in medium
which is going to be way too dark so if
you are someone like me I don't think
this kit is personalizable so knowing
that you might want to skip it because
medium is way too dark I don't know I
might be wrong keep that in mind now if
you're on there and you see oh you can't
choose light then that might be worth it
but medium is way too dark
even light is too dark for me fair is
what I have to do with theirs but the
difference is here I'll show you on the
regular CC cream it's just just the CC
cream it's really nice but on the
illumination one it's got a little pink
bit on the tube which I love
this again still has the SPF of 50 but I
think that this is just more luminous so
it's got a little more let's give it a
whirl again it's gonna be way too dark
maybe I'll use this as a bronzer
seriously so right off the bat doesn't
really have a smell it's really really
creamy looks really nice do you see oh
it is kind of illuminating you guys see
that that is actually pretty nice this
might be something that's nice to mix
with your foundation as well too just to
give it a lumination if you don't want
all of that man I wish this isn't my
shade this is so pretty this would look
really nice on a night out as well and
from what I've heard it's got better
ingredients for your skin I have painted
my entire hand but I like that that's
got some illumination and it the other
one the regular CC cream is not greasy
at all which I really really like but
again it's kind of nice to have the
option and I would probably mix it like
I mentioned but it depends on kind of
the level of illumination that you want
on your skin sorry I'm trying to wipe
all that off that was a lot so cute
packaging and seems to be nice the other
thing that's in here is and I think this
these two things that I just showed you
in this are like the big items in the
kit so it's this giant disc
it says Live Love Laugh vitality face
disc with drops of light technology so
it is this giant like size of my face
giant disc and it looks like it's got a
bronzer blush and a highlighter so you
can kind of get a whole look let's do
some swatches it feels really really
soft so the bronzer is always kind of a
lighter bronzer see I love that
some bronzers are so dark and for
someone like me it's ridiculous but
that's actually like wearable so the
blush woah super pigmented but that's a
pretty color especially as we head into
spring and summer in the highlight the
highlight seems a little more powdery
just softer I guess I should say so
powdery is not always a bad thing I
always hear people talk about that and
it's not always a bad thing but with
something like a highlighter I have to
admit
you know you don't want it to be to
powder because then it'll get all over
your face but those are three really
pretty colors and the blush I think you
just want to be really careful of
because it doesn't look like it's
blending super easily now that I heavily
swatched it so you just want to use a
light hand but I love the bronzer and
the highlight is really pretty you just
want to shake off your brush before you
put it on because it is a little it
kicks up a lot of dust so the next thing
in here is this luxe high-performance
eyeshadow trio and it's in the shade
pretty in spring and it's got like matte
black packaging kind of like the NARS
feel to it and it actually looks like
wearable colors oh I love it now let's
see how it swatches these are actually
colors I would like you know where I
feel like that's so rare and some things
but this is so nice so far they've
swatched okay so you can see the brown I
think is the most pigmented but this is
a really nice color the white was a
little more no it looks nice it's just
because I'm pale it just blends in I
think my favorite shade in it is this
kind of light brown with a little bit of
hint of rose in it wouldn't you say it's
so pretty and I really like the
packaging to be honest this would be a
great thing to travel with because it's
got three colors that you can create a
really simple neutral everyday look with
or maybe a good one to even keep it work
so if you need to touch up or I don't
know I think it's just a really really
wearable trio so the next thing in here
is this it cosmetics heavenly luxe
radiance wand and I just had to take the
time to open it cuz I was like ruining
my nail polish I am excited for this
because their brushes are crazy soft and
they're really known for their really
amazing brushes and I just hauled a few
that I really do love but I love the
shape of this I think the idea is that
you could use it with really any of
those three colors the bronzer you could
totally bronze up the face with this you
could use it for the blush you can even
use it for highlighting it's maybe a
little big for highlighting but it could
work so it's incredibly soft I really
like that it's tapered so I'm actually I
probably really will use this a lot and
the last thing in here is this dual
ended brush which are great for makeup
bags but not great for a few storia
brushes like in a cup or something
because you gotta you gotta pick one end
that you want to
Feist and you got to stick it in there I
usually pick like a smaller end or
something but so this is their heavenly
Lux no tub dual eyeshadow and so it's
got one side that's a little bigger but
it's really soft again but it I think
it'd be great for it's definitely
synthetic for packing on stuff on the
lid but even for that and I think the
idea is that it helps blend the shadows
really easily we got me to tug at it and
the other end is a lot denser and
shorter a lot denser I think this would
be great for going right up on the brow
bone with like a light color you could
even use it in the crease but you could
especially use it if you like to put
shadow on your lower lash line or just
to blend it out that would be fantastic
as well so I'll definitely give this one
a try so all in all it's I mean it's a
nice grouping of products you really can
pretty much get in a complete face with
it you've got your blush bronzer and
highlighter you've got your foundation
or CC cream you've got eyes shadow and
you've got some brushes to use with them
so the only thing you'd really be
missing like if you bought this kit
would be a mascara a liner and maybe
like a lip product so that's just one
thing to keep in mind but it I will say
I mean I was impressed I sometimes these
things can be gimmicky and they're you
know it'll come with one amazing product
and then a few products that are really
kind of crappy but all of these seemed
pretty nice the only complaints I had
was that I think that well I wish this
was my shade and they might offer shade
options and that the highlight was a
little it kicked up a lot of dust which
again you just have to make sure you use
it well but other than that it's a
pretty nice kit so I like it depending
on how much it was you'd have to think
about if it's worth it but I know that
the CC creams alone are really really
expensive so if it's only a little bit
more than that then I would say it
probably would be worth it but
all-in-all it's really really nice
I've always had good experiences with
QVC when I ordered things it usually
ships really quickly and I remember once
I ordered a what was a kit from Tarte I
think I had ordered and it was it was
similar to this the same idea and I
ended up hating it and I had tried every
single product in there and I hated it
so much so I was like there's no way
they're gonna let me return this and
sure enough it was so easy to return so
that's one thing I will say is that QVC
they are really good with their return
policy if you hate it you really can
return it they're not gonna ask you
questions they're not gonna say oh well
did you use this mascara thing yes I did
and I hated it can I return it and they
were so awesome about it so that is
another good thing if you're not sure
and you wanted to try it you can try it
and then if you totally hate it return
it so hopefully this video was helpful
and if you're interested in some other
it cosmetics products that just the
company has sent me not necessarily QVC
with them I'll link that below because I
literally just filmed that I'm wearing
the same outfit and everything lots of
it cosmetics today little again
