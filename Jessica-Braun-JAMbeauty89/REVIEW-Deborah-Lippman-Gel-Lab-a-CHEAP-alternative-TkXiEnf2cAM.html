have a review this is a disappointing
review I was given by it's kind of a
long story who gave it to me but it's
someone that I know sort of she gave me
this and okay here's the thing this is a
$45 product so that's why I'm kind of so
downhearted about this review because
it's so expensive it is $45 it is the
deborah lippmann gel lab nail treatment
duet it says now I was excited I've
never gotten gel nails done because hey
I I can paint my nails pretty well it's
just not something that I'm into
spending my money on just period I have
plenty of nail polish to use so there
you go
so I was excited about this mic oh my
gosh maybe this will last even longer
than what I already used which what I
already use and I'm gonna tell you in a
second it works really well like my
nails usually will last pretty much all
week without really any chips you know
if I'm doing something extreme maybe
there might be a chip and I can fix that
quickly but otherwise it works really
well but I was like gosh if this could
last even longer like two weeks that
might be worth the money hmm so it comes
with this I can take them out but it
comes with like basically two different
things
step one would be this base coat then
you apply a of course it says apply
Deborah Lippmann nail color and make it
work better if I had but I don't own any
and frankly $14 on I know posh again I
don't want to spend that um and also I
don't really need much so you apply the
base coat first and then you apply your
nail color and then you apply this top
coat and that is all you do and that is
supposed to last I wonder what the
claims are in the back it says gel like
long wear high shine quick drying it
says Jo like innovation at your
fingertips no lamp no extra tools just
nail lacquer follow the easy gel lab
system to achieve the look of a gel
manicure with extended wear 360-degree
and ultra quick dry time maybe simply
remove by using the stripper any nail
lacquer
so that's suppose that all you do of
course it never it doesn't give any how
many days you know it'll last type of
claim but still you guys aren't ready
for what I'm about to tell you and what
I'm about to tell you is I applied this
I applied my nail color I applied and
I'm wearing it today not with these
though it's the it's se wrapped in
rubies it's my favorite favorite nail
polish for the Fall I mean come on
perfect nail color for fall right I was
so excited so I applied that I think I
applied two coats cuz that's what it
recommended doing two coats yes then I
coated the topcoat this stuff peeled off
within mmm five hours and by the second
day like all of it was gone
even my boyfriend said he was like
what's going on with you and didn't you
just paint your nails like yeah like
everything it's like falling off and
here's the thing if you've got too many
layers of anything on your nails it's
gonna peel off easily because it's just
so thick it'll snag easily you know so I
tried it again with just one coat and
you know what I mean one coat and it's
still it would just peel off it's
horrible I cannot believe that this is
$45 I cannot believe it
and on top of that it claims to be high
shine not really so my recommendation is
do not spend the money now I'm curious
if anyone's out there that has used this
and it really works well maybe like not
using Essie maybe OPI works better maybe
an actual deborah lippmann colors work
better I don't know but I still don't
think it's worth it because I have this
hmm these amazing products that work so
much better and there's so much cheaper
these are the Revlon Colorstay base and
topcoat these are they - they can range
anywhere from like five to ten dollars
depending on where you get them find
sales and use coupons that's what I
always do and when there is a good sale
I stock up because I've been using this
for like a year and a half and I nothing
has compared to it the base coat is very
similar to the Deborah Lippmann but I
think of my it's just but it's clearly
better
so I put the base coat on and then any
nail color and then you put this on top
these suckers that's what I use today
and that's what I've been using it
really does last like five to six days
you might have little chips here and
there but with then I would say the
first three days you really won't see
any chipping and the thing is I think
that it's the base coat that's really
the magic here because I didn't use to
use a base coat in the top coat it's
it's shiny you know and it's nice but
it's not these shiny as I've ever used
but I think the base coat is what I
think it's magical I don't know what is
in these but and there's so much heat I
mean you can get both of these for
around ten dollars total versus forty
five for a product that really by day to
your nail polish is peeling up I'm very
upset about this so uh if you have any
other like base coats that you love or
like combos let me know below cuz I'm
always curious to try new ones but at
the same time I really freaking love
these and if you ever tried them and
you're facing like you know peeling or
just chipping all the time give these a
try especially the base coat you will
not be sorry I promise so that is my
review on those stray away just stay
away from those things seriously anyway
I hope that was very helpful for you
guys and I will see you guys very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
