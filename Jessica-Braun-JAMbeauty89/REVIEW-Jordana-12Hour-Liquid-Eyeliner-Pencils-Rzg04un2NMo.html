bringing you a review today and I'm
really excited to share it with you guys
because this is a product that it's
amazing okay so they are the Jordana 12
hour made to last liquid eyeliner
pencils these puppies are amazing I have
four different shades I have this purple
one that is called purple fix and I will
of course watch all of these for you
there is purple fix then I also have
this one is called aqua stone now i've
swatched these some of you might be
annoyed because I've already watched
these like I think when I hold these but
hey for those that have not seen that
video this is the black one it's called
black point right there of course you
know the black one on my hand okay and
then this one is called Jade jewel and
it's more of like a dark green you can
see that there it's it looks it might
look similar black but it's a beautiful
grain okay and they have more shade
shade shade selections as well
I sound like Sean Connery anyway so
these are really inexpensive like I said
they I bought mine at Walgreens I want
to say that Ulta sells Jordana - except
for I feel like every time I am there
like it's like all sold out or it just
seems sketchy so I find mine at
Walgreens right near the checkout and I
just love these here are the things
about them I wore these when I
originally first got them I've worn the
black point one the most and I wore
these when like I would tie one with
them and then I would put like gel or
cream liner on top of it anyway so I
never really knew I knew that these were
really really creamy they just glide on
like butter all of the shades do but I
wasn't sure how they kind of wore on
their own you know what I mean so this
past
I was doing that and I was just using
this black point one alone which I
haven't done with a pencil eyeliner in
like probably a year and a half so it's
very odd it is like gosh this is so easy
but this lasted all day it stayed black
black black all day and I would be
getting ready at like 6:00 in the
morning and then I would be taking off
until like 11:00 at night there long
days this looked the same as when I put
it on there was no weird like smudging
on the corners you know I'm sure ladies
you know what I'm talking about with
some things you'll have like weird
smudges like they're there none of that
like it was unbelievable in the first
day it was rainy out and I was in the
ring actually a lot and it was still it
doesn't say it doesn't say waterproof
but I would venture to say these might
be waterproof and if you swatch it on
your hand these are gonna be I'm gonna
have to get makeup remover to get these
off because okay this is perfect example
I just put these on right watch I'm
pushing hard that's barely okay there
was a little smudging there but like I
mean that's incredible that was me
really pushing these are amazing it
doesn't say water I really think they
might be waterproof and they don't
smudge they say on all day they stay
true to their color the colored ones I
don't wear on my upper lash line I wear
on my lower lash line and these suckers
don't budge and like the lower lash line
is where it gets tricky and they didn't
move especially this blue one the Aqua
one it's just like BAM and it stays by
them all day like all day I can't speak
highly enough about these so with that
being said the only downside the only
downside is that a these might be hard
to find depending on where you are they
are a sort of new product and a lot of
these like every time I look for more
shades they're like sold out so that's a
little tricky
your Walgreens might not sell them
frankly and then what else oh just that
because they're so creamy they wear down
quickly meaning you have to sharpen
these like once every other day which
you know I kind of wish these are
retractable but at the same time I feel
like it wouldn't be as creamy if they
weren't there's something about these
and of course these are a very
expensive dupe for the Urban Decay
24-hour pencils as well as the NYX slide
on pencils I might venture to say these
are better I really might now I only
tried the Urban Decay ones once and I
don't even own any currently and the NYX
ones I've tried and I love them but I
think these are better and they're still
cheaper I hope that you guys go and give
these a try because you will love them
that's my review and I will see you guys
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
