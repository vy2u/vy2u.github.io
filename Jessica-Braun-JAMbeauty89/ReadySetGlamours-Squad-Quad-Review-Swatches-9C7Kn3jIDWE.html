going to be reviewing the brand new Etsy
palette which is with Ready Set glamour
whoo I love Michelle if you don't watch
her channel she is just she's one of my
favorite youtubers because she's just
like normal but absolutely glamorous but
not so over-the-top annoying that you're
just like she's just awesome I will link
her channel below but she did a
collaboration with them and she recently
sent it to me and I wanted to share with
you guys my honest feelings about it and
if I think it's worth the money so let's
go ahead and get into it so basically
the deal with this is it's four separate
single shadows that she has curated to
be the squad quad and you get those four
shadows for 30 dollars so what does that
work out to 30 divided by 4 why can't I
do this in my head so that works out to
750 a shadow so if you think about
buying single shadows that would be a
about drugstore price maybe a little bit
pricier but then for 15 more dollars if
you pair it with one of their like
actual palette holders it's 15 more
dollars so you could spend 30 on just
the single shadows or you could spend 45
and get the holder with it they have
different colors this is the Florentine
gold they also have like white and other
shades that you can pick all in all $45
assuming you would buy the palette with
it of course a lot of us have Z palette
so you could just spend 30 and get the
shadows it comes with the palette in
this cute little box here and then the
actual shades were in here and so it
says Ready Set glamour squad quad it's
got these cute little like apartments on
the side and it has four different
shades there is a metallic shade called
squad there are two matte shades called
15 and hash brown and then a pearl eye
shade called chill zone so let's look at
these shades up close so the one in
squad is very very very pigmented very
yellowy gold but I mean like yellow like
almost mustard gold so like this reminds
me of Belle's dress from Beauty and the
Beast gold of course I had to make a
Disney reference because I love Disney
and it
my world anyway it's a beautiful color
but if you know your skin tone and you
know it might not look good with your
skin tone that's something to keep in
mind for me this is not it's all washed
out on the camera but this is not
necessarily a shade that looks awesome
on me but I could still utilize it in a
look so let's move on to the next shade
this one is called hash brown it's one
of the mattes and it's a really again
really pigmented warm medium brown it is
a beautiful shade this is one that if
you don't have one like this in your
collection you need it it is the perfect
shade to blend the crease you could use
a lone in the crease if you want it it's
just perfect
and again insanely pigmented really
blendable I was very impressed with the
quality of this cuz medium Browns can be
very hard to find a good one and this
one is really nice the next shade will
swatch is the other matte one and this
one's called 15 makes me think of the
Taylor Swift song this one is like a
burnt sienna or like a burgundy brown it
still reminds me of a brown but it
really does have that very warm very
warm reddish pull to it again really
pigmented absolutely beautiful this is
gorgeous like on the outer corner not
wearing it today because I was trying
out a different palette for a different
video but just think that shade is
gorgeous the last one in her squad quad
is shimmery tone one and chill zone this
one does kick up some powder actually
this one is probably my favorite it's
this gorgeous shimmery bronze it is so
beautiful it's a total one I shadow look
where you just put it all over the lid
blend it into the crease and go it is so
up my alley personally but it's a
gorgeous shade it would look good on I
think honestly I think every skin tone
it's just so beautifully metallic
without being glittery or chunky or
anything like that so the palette itself
that cost $15 is really well made you
can get z palettes for around that price
ish the only thing I didn't love about
this I think it's really well made like
it's thick its durable but the only
thing I didn't like is this plastic like
sleeve I guess you could rip it out I
mean I guess you don't need it in but it
seems like it's an integral to the
actual oh I'm just gonna take it out I
ripped out a little bit of the like foam
maybe I wasn't supposed to take that off
but I don't like it like I don't want it
there so for me I knew that was gonna
drive me nuts owner but it's a really
strong magnet magnetic closure and a
really nice big mirror and again it does
feel well-made that was just the only
piece that I didn't like so all in all
do I think this is all worth $45 that's
a lot of money like that's really
expensive do I think the shadows are
really really nice absolutely I mean
look at them they're gorgeous I think
it's a really cool combination of colors
that's kind of unique and that's what I
liked about it it's not just like
copying everything else that's out there
I think Michelle did an awesome job at
that and the quality is absolutely
through the roof amazing amazing $45
though for all of this I think that's a
lot $30 just for the shadows I could see
because I think of like makeup geek
quality is still on par with this I
would say what I would recommend if
you're thinking about doing this by the
shadows maybe skip the palette if you
already have something to hold them in
if you already have a Z palette maybe if
you don't then this is worth buying
because it is nice and it's essentially
the exact same purpose I mean it's the
same idea as a Z palette and honestly I
think it might be a little bit more and
well-made but if you already have that
you really don't need this separate
palette I feel like I'm being redundant
but that's kind of my two cents on it
take it for what you will I really did
like it but I'm always honest with you
guys about the parts maybe I didn't like
I will link her channel as well as her
palette down below if you are interested
in looking at it closer maybe you're
just interested in looking at it see
shadows because they obviously are a
really high quality and I was very very
impressed especially with it's a brand
I've never ever heard of and it's it's C
not if C its itts e so it is it's kind
of confusing anyway other than that I
hope this video is helpful if you are
interested in more of my drugstore I
typically do drugstore if you're
interested in more of my drugstore
reviews and swatch videos I will link my
playlist below other
that I hope you'll subscribe before you
leave and I'll see you guys my next one
