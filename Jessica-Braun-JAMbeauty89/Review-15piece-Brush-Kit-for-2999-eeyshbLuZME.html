have a really pretty awesome thing to
share with you guys so this company
called Altair beauty who I'd never heard
before sent me these brushes to review
and it's a whole kit of brushes and I
was really intrigued because of how cute
they are and I don't care how shallow
that sounds cuz when you ladies see them
you'll be like okay those are crazy cute
I get it but I was really excited
because it also came at the brushroll
and it's a really inexpensive kit so I
was thinking you know if this is
actually good this is gonna be awesome
for people out there that really want to
have kind of a whole kit of brushes to
be able to do their whole face with
without having to spend you know freakin
$100 $200 and and up with any other
brands so this is a brand I'll put the
link below for if you're interested in
purchasing it but you buy it through
Amazon and it's 29.99 and you get 15
different brushes that come with the and
this brush whole so let me let me roll
it up so you guys to like see like the
full effect okay so it's a brush for
like this it's gold and then it's got
the ties you can tie it and things like
that and it says I'll tear Beauty there
in pink it's kind of harder to see so
when you unroll it it's got this
protective covering over it so when you
travel with it you know it keeps them
safe and then there's all 15 brushes now
they have these adorable gold Ferrell's
and on top of that they're pink and
white chevron oh isn't that so cute so
oh I just love them all of them are
synthetic which means that the product
you're getting on the brush isn't going
to be pushed farther into the brush it's
actually going to go on your face the
pigment will go on your face or not into
the brush you know what I mean so that
is really nice like I said there's 15 of
them there's a few face brushes and then
a ton of eye brushes so I'm gonna they
it comes with like an explanation of all
the different brushes and what what each
one is for now I got these like three or
four weeks ago and I've been playing
with them for quite a while now just
because I figured if I'm gonna do this
justice I want to see how I use the
brushes because sometimes something like
for example one of the brushes is
marketed as a lip brush and I ended up
using it for eyeshadows so you know you
find different use
for different things so I just wanted to
be able to share that with you guys too
so let's start with the face brushes
this one is their powder brush and I
actually initially hadn't looked at this
when I used this like the first week and
I ended up using this more for blush and
the reason is because it's not quite as
rounded as most powder brushes that I
typically would use but it is really of
course all of these are incredibly soft
like stupid soft it's awesome but I
really liked it for blush but I have
since I found out that it's marketed as
the powder one use it for powder and it
does a good job I mean it's powder
brushes their powder brushes to me so
but it works the next one is their
angled contour brush and this one of
course is angled like they said and I
love this for blush more so than the
powder brush makes sense just because of
the shape and it also would work really
well for getting in there with that
angle getting in there for your contour
and even you can even bronze up there
with it if you wanted I really really
like this one a lot now my favorite I
think this is my favorite face brush
that it comes with is their dome contour
and it's just don't just like it's
entitled and it is my new absolute
favorite contour brush ever it would
also be really good for highlight if you
wanted to use it because it is a little
bit smaller but I just it's the perfect
shape to really get in there for your
contour and not get powder you know
contour or bronzer I mean all over the
place they can really be really
controlled and these are just so soft
the next one is their foundation brush
and it's one of those classic foundation
brushes this one I really know how much
to be used for a lot of you recommended
to use this type of brush for maybe
applying a face mask or maybe even
applying primer I haven't really used it
in either one of those ways it's just
not to me a useful brush but if you do
like these brushes hey it comes with one
so that's always nice the next one is
their concealer brush and I've actually
been using this to apply my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and even for spot
concealing it I mean it applies it
really well I always with my concealer
end up kind of melting it into the skin
with my fingers anyway and I do that
with this too so that's something to
keep in mind I don't think it's
best at blending it completely in but it
applies it well and yeah the next one is
okay this one is their blending I brush
and it reminds me of the Sigma e-40
except for this one's a little bit I
think it's a little bit bigger and I
kind of like it because I use these
types of brushes to blend all of my
shadows together so it doesn't look like
there's like a stripe where your crease
is you know what I mean so it's not like
a tiger stripes so I love this one and I
found myself reaching for this one over
my Sigma one almost every single morning
so I really really like this it's just
so perfect it's so flawless when it
blends it all together the next one they
have okay
they have three eyeshadow brushes and
one is large medium and small this is
their large one they're all this same
shape and then this one's the medium
I'll just hold them all next to each
other can you guys see those they're
great especially the small medium one
for outer corner for the crease because
they're really detailed the bigger one
I've been using to pack shadow onto the
lid and what I will say about these
brushes is that the way that they're
made is interesting because when I even
today I've been applying loose eyeshadow
sorry my brain is I've been applying
loose eyeshadow with this and what's
amazing is that loose eyeshadow have
used before
it's especially the one that I was using
I would have a lot of fall out down here
but when I apply it with this brush I
don't have any fallout and I can't
decide if it's the brush like how it's
just kind of amazing so if it is this
brush that's amazing I haven't it's the
only variable in this scientific
experiment so I guess it's got to be
this that's helping it not you know it's
on the brush and then it's on my lid it
doesn't fall it's not like you know does
that make any sense what I'm saying so
I'm really impressed and I've been using
those a lot now another one is their
flat definer brush and this one I use
for my lower lash line I'll dip it into
some sort of darker eyeshadow and I'll
just kind of use it to kind of smudge
that area down there I typically don't
have a really defined line so I really
really like using this with eyeshadow
my lower lashline the next one is their
angled eye slash brow brush in this one
I have been using every single day this
month for my brows with my Anastasia
brow powder and I really like it I mean
it's the perfect shade you could use it
for eyeline or you could use it for
shadow but I use it for my brows and
it's a really good one
frankly it's really it's this the same
if not better than the the anastacio one
that they sell the brush do the same
they are absolutely the same in fact I
reach this one more because it's cuter
okay the next one is an eyeliner brush
and I've been using this with my it's
real real tiny I've been using this with
my L'Oreal infallible 24 hour cream
liner jelling or whatever it is and its
really really detail-oriented I'm not a
humongous fan of this shape of a brush
when it comes to eyeliner because I just
typically use one that's more of like a
little bit more to it but if you like
this kind it's good and it applies it
well I mean I've been using it and it's
been fine and it allows for a lot of
control which is nice too the next one
is their lip brush and this is the one I
talked about this one I'll use a lot for
my outer corner as well I typically
don't use brushes for my lips I'm not
really a makeup artist so I just I just
throw that lipstick right on there
ladies but this is really good as well
for the outer corner I think now two
more this spoolie that it comes with is
awesome it's a little bit fluffier than
most bullies and I really like it
because I find that when I'm brushing
through my brows it kind of like really
evenly disperses all of the color that
I've put in there so I really actually
like this one a lot and then it also
comes with the lash cone thing which I
use these all the time so it's always
nice to have another one you know it's
the same as any he'd get really don't
notice the difference between any of
them but let's see if there's anything I
should also tell you guys about yes so
it says that these are all vegan
synthetic brush hairs so if you're if
you're trying to be cruelty free or
you're just trying to be vegan
across-the-board when it comes to this
kind of stuff you'd be safe with this
the handles are made of what I'm just I
might as well tell you all of it the
handles are made of wood this is a gold
aluminum ferrule it says these really
are so cute let's see is that all pretty
much so like I said I'll evenly
below I think my favorite thing about
all of this truly is the fact that
they're cute they're incredibly
economical
I mean $30 for 15 brushes is $2 a brush
even the $3.00 elf brushes are more
expensive than if you really think about
it now they sell it in kits too but
they're really really nice you can do a
full face with it I did today everything
that I used on my face I used with these
brushes and nothing else so keep that in
mind now my foundation I just applied
with my hands because I like I said I
don't use foundation brushes like this
but I apply foundation with my hands a
third of the time anyways so keep that
in mind but other than foundation I did
my entire face using just these brushes
and I have to admit that I was impressed
because when I first got him I was like
I don't know you know I've got a lot of
brushes and I already have so many
favorites that I love and I'm a Sigma
affiliate and I'm like but at the end of
the day I'm like this is such a good
deal and I've got to tell you guys about
it because it really it's a really good
deal for a lot of brushes and it's look
how cute this is all done up
it's so perfect for travel I just can't
get over it and even if you're someone
like me that does have a lot of brushes
you're like okay I do not need any more
brushes it's still a pretty good deal
because for 30 bucks you can get this
and then this can just be kind of your
go-to travel you can just have it put
away and grab it when you're traveling
and know that you have a full face with
you a full brush face you know what I'm
saying anyway so I hope that was helpful
for you guys especially in your search
for maybe more brushes or maybe a
complete set of brushes and by the way
these look adorable like if you've got a
little cup even just like a clear glass
from the dollar store anything you can
put all of them in there on your vanity
or wherever you get ready and they're so
cute just sitting there I can just look
at them anyway so I'll catch you guys
very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
