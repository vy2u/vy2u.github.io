review for you and today I'm going to be
reviewing the maybelline baby skin pore
instant pore eraser so it's a primer and
I was very I was really excited when I
saw this and when I thought it was like
$4.99 I was like yup so I of course
bought it and I was so excited to review
it for you guys so I've been using it
for about a week and the I did have a
little bit of reservation about it
because I feel like drugstore primers
are really tricky and most of them are
no good now I haven't tried a ton of
them but the ones that I have tried I've
been like yeah they're okay but I didn't
love them but I did love my Smashbox one
and if you've seen my uh what did I call
it like the best in beauty of 2013 I
called it the GME awards cuz jam my
screen name and my screen name what is
this AOL circa 1999 my screen name here
on YouTube or those are my initials by
the way J am are my initials so I called
him the GME Awards like the Grammys I
thought it was cute out of them so dumb
whatever anyway so I can link that below
but in it I mentioned that my favorite
primer of the year is my Smashbox
photo-finish 1 it's kind of a
silicon-based feel to it it's really
hard to describe unless you know what I
mean
almost like waxy but in a nice way like
a really velvety feel that maybe is it a
velvety feeling to it and I've loved it
but it's really really expensive so I
usually will get it like it's like small
versions of it in like Smashbox try it
type kits so I've never had to buy it
full size but if I ever had to it's a
really really expensive so when I saw
this I was hoping it would be like that
and it is it's just like it now there
might be some ingredient differences but
it's got that same Vil velvety feel I
think this is maybe a little bit more
liquidy it's a little less thick than
the Smashbox but it's pretty darn close
and this is $4.99 are you kidding me
so um it's just it comes with a good
amount it's 0.67 and fluid ounces which
and there on the primers I think that's
plenty really so it comes in like the
little squeezy tube and it's just a
clear if you can even see that it's just
a clear it just blends
it mattifies your face but of course
most importantly it fills your pores and
that's the whole idea behind it they say
you can wear it alone you can wear under
foundation I wear it under foundation
but I did try a couple day now like I
said I've tried this probably like six
or seven times the first time I did it I
just put it on and kind of just like let
it sink in and then just looked at my
face and it really did look like it
really does fill in your pores really
nicely of course then I put foundation
over and I tried it with my Revlon
Colorstay for normal to dry skin which I
use all the time and then I also tried
it with my Rimmel the not wake me up
foundation the match perfection
foundation and that one tends to be a
little bit greasy on my face but with
this it was gorgeous and of course with
both of them I still had to set my
foundation especially in my t-zone
because I was just a little bit oily but
this holds onto your makeup all day like
it didn't slide around I was out in the
snow and came back and actually today I
was out in the snow and I didn't touch
up my foundation or anything it just it
doesn't move around it really stays put
it makes your pores seem so much smaller
even if you have like blackheads or
anything like that it kind of helps
reduce those especially and then you put
foundation on it and just hold onto it
it just holds on it stupid I mean it's
really nice for five dollars
this is quickly becoming a staple in my
little collection here and I'm just
floored by how it expensive and even in
the drugstore things are starting to get
upwards of like 10 to 12 dollars so when
I saw this is still only like $4.99 I
was like whoa this is like old school
pricing so Maybelline thank you for
coming out with a product like this I
love it and I'm so genuinely surprised
trying to think if there's anything else
I should tell you it's it's cheap it's
oh where to find it I found mine at a
store called Meyer if you have one near
you it's only a few states that it
covers but I would bet you can find it
at Walgreens and CVS they especially
Walgreens I feel like they always have
the new products they're always the
first to get them I don't know I haven't
seen these at Target yet let me know
below if you have seen them Target hey
by the way thank just thank you to
everyone first of all you
are also supportive and everyone so I'll
get like not a mean comment but maybe a
comment that's not you know you should
what's cool is even my subscribers that
might say something that's not negative
but kinda a little bit negative they'll
usually say in a nice way so it's very
interesting my subscribers so thank you
all even the people that have something
that's maybe not 100% positive to say to
me I take those into consideration and
thank you so that being said I wanted to
thank you also because I said that I
couldn't find the Rimmel mascara in the
stores near me and you guys all flooded
me with comments of where you found them
even some people put links to UM
websites that could buy them I have
found them in the store near me finally
so thank you guys I just thought that
was so sweet you guys are always so
helpful and I hope that I'm helpful for
you guys too obviously that's why I'm
doing these and that's why I love doing
them anyway um so that was totally
beside the point but you guys you just
make me feel very warm inside in my
heart so and also a little tidbit about
me I my little brother who's I mean he's
with my little brother but he's taller
than me he's 23 but um no 24 no 23 sorry
I was thinking I wrote a card to him and
I said 23 and I'm hoping I was right yes
he's 23
um but he just left for I'm not gonna
say where he's going but he's in the
Navy and he's an officer now and so he's
now on the other side of the country and
he left this morning it was really hard
so if I look like puffy I've been like
crying all day cuz I just he's one of my
best friends and it's just hard to see
him go for a long time but um but thank
you to everyone for supporting me all
the time and I know I'm kind of I feel
like my videos I'm kind of like I'll
upload a bunch at a time and then just
like once in a week and it's because of
things like this things like this that
are going on in my life right now that
are really hard to deal with so I
appreciate all your support and your
love and if you've got anyone in the
military whether it's your family member
or your husband or your child you you
know what I'm going through and it's not
easy and so it's definitely nice to see
all the support and love from you guys
so anyway now that was completely beside
the point but um I really if you see in
stores you're looking for a primer buy
it
if you
the silicone type the velvety filled
primers by it you'll love it and it's
five bucks you really can't go wrong
anyway I hope that was helpful and I'll
catch you guys very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
