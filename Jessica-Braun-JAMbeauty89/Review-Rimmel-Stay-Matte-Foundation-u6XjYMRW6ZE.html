review for you on the Rimmel stay matte
foundation it's officially called the
stay matte liquid mousse foundation I
bought it in the shade zero nine one
light ivory I'm wearing it today this is
a product that has been very confusing
to me because I went into it knowing it
was a thicker foundation cuz I've seen a
few reviews on this product and I was
trying to decide do I even want to buy
it
and then I was at the store and it was
like $5.99 and I was like okay I'm just
gonna freakin buy it I'm just gonna buy
it so I bought it and I thought well
done I can review it for you guys let
you guys know how I like it with my skin
type few things about my skin my skin is
definitely combo right now I'm I've got
a little bit of dryness and oiliness
like all at the same time you know what
I mean I certainly have a lot of dryness
around my nose right now and right up
here and yet I also have oiliness up
there this is like I said a very thick
consistency and I'll show you it just
squirts out and it a little bit
definitely goes a pretty long way I
think I think that shade wise there's
not really a perfect one for me I was
watching these in the store and I'm
pretty much in between this shade and
the shade right below it which i think
is the lightest shade so unfortunately
it's not a humongous shade selection but
you could always warm it up with a
bronzer or you don't know I don't know
so I'm not in love I don't think it's
the perfect shade for me but I went for
this one instead of the other cuz the
other was just a little bit too pale
where I was like okay no so this was the
closest I could get I actually like the
consistency of this it reminds me of I
can't think of what it reminds me of it
reminds me of the what am I think enough
oh the Rimmel kind of whipped foundation
I think the whipped foundation is a
little bit thinner than this I think I
don't know I haven't had it like over a
year so I don't really remember but I
remember loving it however what I
remember about that and what I have
about this is that if you have any dry
patches you will see them this certainly
enhances any dryness you might have that
being said in the summertime what I
really don't have dry skin this is going
to be my Holy Grail because it is
exactly the amount of coverage that I
want it's I would say medium coverage
and up so if you want it you know if you
want full coverage you can easily get
this with this however each time you
take it on it cakes up in those dry
areas you have to keep that in mind now
I think if you have oily skin you might
love this foundation if you can find the
shade that matches you it's inexpensive
it's got a it's got a fluid ounce of
product so it's a normal amount of
product easy to travel with because it's
just you know it's plastic it you know I
I really do like it I just wish I didn't
have any dry patches cuz that is
literally the only gripe I have with it
if I put it on in the morning and don't
set it with powder it really controls
the shine all day it's not a hundred
percent without a thousand percent how
many percent I don't know it's not
completely matte by the end of the day
but it's not as shiny as I get with
virtually any other foundation including
my Revlon Colorstay my grandma on color
stay still will get a little bit oily
where if I'm going to go out that night
I need to kind of touch up or at least
blot with this I really don't feel the
need to it's kind of a nice by the end
of the day it was kind of a nice glow
without looking to do or anything like
that if you said it with powder
it'll probably it probably will be matte
all day I would like to try this with my
Rimmel stay matte powder I did that this
morning and it's it's nice I like the
way it looks but I haven't gotten to
wear it throughout the whole day and see
but I love the Rimmel stay matte powder
so I have a feeling it's gonna be the
perfect combo and I really do like the
finish that it gave me today so pros
really inexpensive packaging is cute I
think and it's easy to travel with it's
a good amount of product it will be easy
to find I'm sure once it's fully out
there in the market I think it's kind of
a slower roll out right now let me know
where you find this so that
other people can see I found another
store near me called Meijer which only
is it a few states so let me know if
you've seen it at CVS Walgreens Target
and list it below that way other people
can know where they can find it near
them they live in the u.s. some of the
cons if you have dry skin you probably
won't love this if you have dry skin
just in the winter I would say pick it
up and give it a try and you really you
might like it if you don't like it now
you will in a few months once you're
more oily in the summer because I really
do like it now and I'm still going to
wear it but I guess my biggest gripe is
when I'm up close to the mirror I feel
like if people are up close to me the
bit
dryness dry dry dry and I've used it
with primer I've used it with
moisturizers I've used it a lot of
different ways and either way it's still
kind of enhances that dryness so I would
say if you find it it's five or six
bucks if you want something that is
gonna mattify you're gonna like this
it mattifies better than any other
drugstore foundation I've personally
used of course I haven't used every
single one out there but I really do
like it I don't regret buying it I just
wish there were more shades as well
however I have been using it the way
that I apply it is with my Sigma f80 -
hold on let me go grab okay I apply it
with my Sigma f80 that's what it is I
can never think of what it is my SAT
brush which is the flat top one and what
I do is I just I put the a dollop of it
on my hand and then I kind of even it
out in just a little bit and then wipe
what's left that way it's not just one
glob and then I dip right into it
there's just a glob on there I kind of
spread it out then I dip into it and I
just brush it or buff it into the skin
you can start anywhere you want
typically you're supposed to start kind
of in the middle and then buff out I
really like it I will say though with
this brush with every other foundation
it's seamless but with this one I do
since I have that dry skin I'll do it
with this brush and then I'll have to
kind of go in and use my hands to kind
of meld it into the skin right around
where I'm dry so that's one thing to
keep in mind but yes so that is my
review on this product let me know if
you've tried it and how you felt about
it and let me know your skin type too
because I'm curious to know how it does
work for oily skin gals if it's really
nice or maybe it's not so let me know
your thoughts and where maybe you have
found it
for and I'll catch you guys very soon
