foundation review for you all today I'll
be reviewing if I can find it the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation but I'm
specifically reviewing it for people
that have combination skin now when I
say I've got combination skin I mean
that I get both dry and oily almost any
time of year so I always have dry
patches here and like in random spots on
my forehead and then especially on the
sides of my nose is
and then I'll randomly get dry spots but
that's where the main concentration of
dryness is on my face I also have oily
skin meaning those same areas get oily
throughout the day even when I first
apply my foundation virtually any
foundation so know that going in if you
have similar skin this is probably going
to be helpful if you have really oily
skin a really dry skin I would suggest
you check out my friend it's Kirsten had
filmed a video and it was a collab with
another girl
where Kirsten has really oily skin and
the other woman has a really dry skin so
it's really really helpful I can link
Kirsten's channel below because that's
what kind of inspired me to do this
because I watched both and that I
thought you know what I don't have
either one of those skins I'm right in
between so I figured this might be a
helpful review for everyone else that's
in between if you're otherwise though
watch their reviews I think it'll be
helpful but this I get in the shade 150
buff which that is exactly the shade
that I wear in both Revlon regular
Colorstay which I get the normal to dry
skin the problem with regular Revlon
Colorstay is they have combo and oily
skin and normal to dry and I'm right in
between I would be combo but I've
noticed that the combo oily skin one is
too drying on my face so I tip stick
with the normal to dry however I notice
that I think I like this one better and
here's why it when you apply it a
certain way it doesn't accentuate your
dryness or make you Olli really you can
really find a perfect mixture there with
this and I really think it's got a
little bit more coverage depending on
how you apply it then the regular color
stay I wish the packaging was a little
more travel friendly it's a really thick
glass and it's not I don't think it's
anything that's going to break but it's
not really easy to travel with it's
heavy it's kind of big for the amount of
ounces it comes with 0.8 fluid out
so it's a little bit less than the
typical one ounce and a foundation but
the way that I have tried applying I
tried applying it a lot of different
ways I tried with my hands and that is
the best way to avoid any dry patches
however it's got a lot less coverage
when you do it that way I've also tried
applying it with my Sigma brushes now
I've got the f80 and f82 that I've used
this one's a little bit denser in this
one they're both really dense I think I
still like the flat top one the f80 best
and that is almost always the case I
just I just love this brush however when
I use either one of these brushes it
accentuates my dry spots even more
because it doesn't 1000% buffett right
into the skin so then I tried it with my
Beauty Blender which of course is dirty
but when you moisten this and apply any
foundation it always is a really nice
dewy fin not dewy but not dry finish it
always makes it look pretty flawless
however again you compromise the opacity
of the foundation so it's opacity a word
it's gotta be right like the opaqueness
of it that's a word right am I crazy is
that a word I'm gonna have to look it up
I'm not gonna look it up Who am I
kidding anyway so here's what I realized
this it's not as high coverage when I
use it
fingers same thing this it's a little
too dry so what I've done and this is
the way I applied it today as well is I
applied it with my Sigma f80 brush and
then I with this being moist I just went
over any dry spots with it and though
the water from this kind of just helped
melt those spot parts into the skin but
I didn't have to do it on my cheeks
which means that's where I need the most
coverage because I've got like freckles
and I've got some like hyperpigmentation
and stuff and now well I don't want
those 1,000% covered up I don't mind my
freckles in fact I like them I don't
want it I want it to be a little more
high coverage that way when I put a
blush on it really stands out and it
doesn't look all muddy because of
freckles and things like that so I apply
it with this brush then i go over dry
spots with this with nothing on it of
course it's dirty but with nothing on it
just to help melt it into the skin and
it is perfect I love the way it applies
it now of course that sinks because
you're using so many tools but I really
do love I'm wearing it today like I said
and I love the way it makes my skin look
it
is just the perfect in-between one of my
favorite drugstore foundations and it's
nice because if you already have the
Revlon Colorstay then you're already
going to know what shade you're going to
need for this now another thing that
I've tried and it makes me laugh because
it was such a fail I was like you know
what I wonder if this would be a little
less drying if I mix some argan oil with
it oh my gosh it literally I got to show
you what it does okay first of all I
haven't even shown you the consistency
of it it really is a lot thicker than
most of course because it's kind of like
a cream whipped foundation I already
blended it why did I do it that way here
it is so it's just it looks a little
darker than my skin but it really does
melt nicely and I love the way it blends
in and I try to blend it with some argan
oil and this is the Josie Maran but you
can get any brand uhm just thinking it
would kind of you know help I'm just
putting one drop on okay it's rolling
away I think here it goes
look how do Park it gets it gets so dark
so quick I'm like what didn't work of
course it didn't work because a lot of
times when you do that with certain
foundations they already have an oil
base so it's like you just can't do it I
think so bad I live so hard and of
course I don't have anything to wipe
this off hold on oh my gosh so that's
what happens when you try new things of
course so I just thought that was funny
and I would share with you net guys now
I'm sure there are people out there that
are like duh course you shouldn't do
that but hey it was worth a shot you
know so I just thought ah still an argan
oil all over the place okay so I just
thought that was funny our chair but
that didn't work
however then I also was like you know
what does setting sprays because a lot
of them have a moisturizing effect to
them where it's kind of like the same
thing with the Beauty Blender when
you're getting the water and the
moisture into your skin maybe this would
do the same the mac fix+ I I got the
smaller size because I'd never tried it
before and I really don't use it all
that often but I know that didn't even
that didn't even is it gonna do it there
we go
not that it really matters anyway I've
only used this a few is it focused on me
at all you guys this is take this camera
is taking me so long to learn it's still
not fun
this is it oh my gosh come on now stay
with me there we go
anyway um by the way the camera I'm
using is the Canon Rebel t5i I know a
lot of people have asked I guess I
should list it below but that's what
I've been using and trying to learn and
I love it
but boy there's a lot to learn and I
want I'm one of those people that I want
to know every single thing there is to
know about the things that I own and
this is the camera where I look at the
book and I watch tutorials online and
I'm like there's no way for me to know
everything there is to know about this
camera there's so much about photography
I just don't understand yet
I say yet because I will one day but
anyway mac fix+ this video makes no
sense I'm sorry and if you're watching
this and you're like who is this girl I
never watch your videos you're probably
like I've never watched them again if
she's crazy but yeah that's just the way
I roll fix+ it's too dewy with this
foundation I think I think it can work
but if you are prone to the oiliness I
think this was almost too much I think
this one was perfect though the Urban
Decay all nighter of course this is the
old packaging but this one was great
because it it helped kind of meld it
into the skin and get rid of that dry
looking mists of it but it held it on
all day and it wasn't too dewy so I
really liked this elf also has a good
one the elf makeup mist in sets got a
bunch of vitamins kind of like this
which I like but I don't have any more
because I've run out of it by the way
what I'm wearing on my lips is the
Mirabella sweet velvet lip pencil and I
got this in a peroxy charm
Roxy charm boxy charm and I really
really like it and I don't know what
color it is though but I think it is so
freaking pretty is that not gorgeous and
so I'm wearing it on my lips today and I
really like it shoe but I just wish I
knew what color it was cuz it doesn't
say it anywhere anyway well now that I
blabbered on about nothing I hope that
review is helpful for you guys let me
know what your experiences have been
with this foundation and if you have any
other drugstore foundations that you
would like me to review please list them
down below because I'm always wanting to
try new best mascaras foundations and
also I have a lot of foundations that I
haven't reviewed because I'm not sure
how much of an interest there really is
in it so hopefully this was helpful and
I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
