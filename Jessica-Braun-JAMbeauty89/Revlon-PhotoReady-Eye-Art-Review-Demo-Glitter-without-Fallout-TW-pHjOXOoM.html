going to do a quick review of the Revlon
eye art duo now I've got this in the
shade I can find it topaz twinkle and
they had a lot of other shades as well
but this was the one I gravitated
towards because I figured I would be
able to wear it more often than anything
and I wanted to make sure I liked it at
all
I have it on today so I'm going to show
you how I used it how I applied it and
really kind of a swatch test to see how
it is so I'm going to go ahead and use a
primer with this this is one I'm just
this is the Too Faced shadow insurance
elf has amazing ones you could use a
cream shadow but just in case it's
always better to just start with the
primer just because it even with
high-end shadows you're just better off
it seems to add it just creates a really
flawless base it gets rid of any if it's
a good primer it gets rid of any
discoloration you might have so what
everything just looks even it's more
likely not to smudge and crease and
anything like that like I said to face
this one's more expensive but gosh elf
makes amazing ones that I use daily wet
and wild makes amazing ones I mean
Milani there are a thousand amazing one
so you really don't have to splurge I
just need to use this and try it out a
little more sometime using it anyway so
um this is a two-step process here and
they have all kinds of colors I've got
like a bluish one they've got a greenish
one which I've got my eye on but it had
a similar color like gold and glitter
and I didn't really want to get two that
are too similar so I just ended up
getting this one to start with and let's
just see so it's his lid line and lash
and I would bet is I'm you put this you
put this and on first and it's just got
a doe foot applicator and it does seem
pretty wet let's just swatch a little
bit here oh it's a really really pretty
color really really shimmery and it
looks like it might take a little bit of
time to dry but let's blend and see what
it does when we blend it okay so it's
still yeah almost blends away I mean
it's still shimmery but so it looks like
the longer you let it dry the more
pigmented it will stay
so okay so I'm going to get another
little dip in here and actually apply it
I think I'm just gonna put it on my lid
maybe a little bit into the crease but
not much farther because otherwise it'll
look redonkulous on me so whoa that's
already a ton so I'm going to use my
finger to blend the rest together
now with things like this sometimes you
have to work quickly because you don't
know how quickly it will dry and then it
can look crazy so you could also use a
brush to blend this together but it
already feels kind of tacky so I think a
brush might not be your best bet with
something like this when you're trying
to blend it all over so it already feels
dry and it's only been like 30 seconds
and I on its own I think on someone as
fair as me it it looks okay I think it
needs like maybe some other kind of just
shadow to kind of make it blend in so
I'm going to think I'm going to use my
favorite kind of buffing color I'm going
to use Mac's Omega shadow which is this
kind of grayish tone here and I'm just
going to use a fluffy brush it doesn't
matter the brand as long as it's fluffy
this is a sigma one let me kind of wipe
it off real fast
so I'm just going to get some onto here
and I'm just gonna blend that into the
crease just to make it look a little
more uniform you know so it doesn't look
like a Stark I only put something on my
lid kind of thing and I'm just I mean
I'm being messy with it you don't even
have to be precise with something like
this and notice I left right under the
brow bone of course alone I think that
looks a little bit better a little more
put together than just alone and you
this is something you could make super
smoky you know you could do away darker
color you could do a cut crease with a
really dark I mean there's a ton you can
do with this but for me for the everyday
you know I'm a teacher trying to see if
I can wear this in the everyday it seems
like it would be just dandy so now we're
going to go in with the gold color this
the
I just looking at this last night it's
like a paintbrush and I'm going to do it
kind of on its own over here it is truly
a glitter I mean it is absolutely
gorgeous and when you put it on top of
this it's even prettier did I do a good
job of that
but you do have to dip it a lot because
like you can see I've already run out of
some of the glitter so you do have to
kind of keep redoing which is fine now
you can use this just to line your lid
so if you did like a black line which I
will to complete this look you know
black liner and then you did the gold on
top or you can put this all over it I
think that would be such a fun look for
like a New Year's Eve look or just a
going out at night party look I mean
anything like that I think this could be
amazing and it's so much easier than
putting on a glitter glue and then
putting loose glitter and then you're
getting glitter everywhere so I'm hoping
this will eliminate those two products
where it's just kind of an all-in-one
step so I'm going to put it all over the
lid wish me luck here and I think the
key would be making sure that you let
everything dry
the good news is there really is I mean
there's literally no fallout now I'm
going to use my finger real quickly to
kind of just Pat it to make sure there's
no weird lines from the fact that I it's
basically like a brush just patting it
everywhere where it already is to kind
of set it in what I'm noticing is that
in the middle of my eye here it's just
gone like there's no glitter and I can't
tell if that's like from creasing so I'm
going to add a little more to it and
just kind of blend that in with my
finger wow that's what I'm talking about
so I've let it dry for the most part
this one's still drying a little bit and
it feels incredibly sticky like
incredibly sticky like the kind where it
feels like someone's pulling your eyelid
up so so I don't know I mean it's
getting better the longer it dries so
that's good but I do feel like it needs
something else here like in the crease
so I'm just taking my wet and wild
comfort zone palette and I'm going to
grab this kind of olivey green shade up
here with a thinner brush and I'm just
going to brush a little of this into the
crease just to define this look just a
little bit more because I feel like it
needs something else
and I feel like this olive green lends
itself well to this look just because
the bronzes and the golds and there's
kind of like a rose gold a rose gold
glitter in there I think it all of just
complements it really well
this is my favorite shadow in the
comfort zone palette if you can't tell
it's like the one I've used the most I
just love it so now that it's all dry
I'm going to take this is from my altair
beauty set and I'm just going to take
like a cream shade we'll just go ahead
and use this one from the wet wild
palette just because it's in front of me
and I'm just going to get a little bit
on it and I really mean just a little
bit and just start it up there just to
add a little lightness under the brow
bone get a little more and then I'm just
going to kind of dab it in and then
blend it the price point on this is
$8.99 at least at Walgreens where I
found it um it's you know kind of
pricier but you can usually find coupons
and sales all the time at Walgreens and
CVS and anywhere else she would go to
buy this the texture on this I think is
nice especially of the cream part and
the glitter I think would work even
better it's just a glitter line but I'm
impressed I mentioned in the previous
footage that it was kind of sticky but
I've now had it on for like eight hours
and it hasn't budged at all and it
doesn't feel sticky anymore so once it
dried all the way down it was no longer
sticky it I think it looks really really
nice and kind of gosh it's just such an
awesome option to not have to use loose
glitter and like glittery glue or
anything like that because there's no
fallout whatsoever I mean it's like
impossible to have fallout with this I
am so impressed I mean really this is
the first drugstore glittery product
that I've actually liked that feels very
high-end very luxurious I want to go out
and get the green one because I love
greens and I think that would be a
gorgeous option
I think the cream part works best with
your finger you've got to blend it out
with your finger you could try it with a
brush but based on how quickly it dries
and how long it stays I really do
recommend using your fingers to apply it
the wear time is incredible it lasts all
day clearly and like I said I mean it's
not coming off at all and it just stayed
put as long as you let it dry for about
a solid really minute it won't feel
sticky anymore and it just I really
really like it I've gotten a lot of
compliments on it today as I've been out
and about overall would I recommend this
absolutely it's a product that is kind
of odd like I
think I would like it and I thought
maybe it would be kind of gimmicky but
it's actually incredible it feels very
luxurious like I mentioned both of these
are amazing I'm so excited to get maybe
one or two more because it's such an
awesome option for a night out where you
just want a little glitter you could use
the glitter part to do a little glitter
line on the bottom there's so much you
can do with this one product that $8.99
is a small price to pay for how much
this can do and I think this would be an
awesome thing as you're traveling if you
just bring kind of a basic pallet or
just some basic shadows to throw one of
these in your makeup bag as well just to
add a lot more options for what the
nighttime you know if you just want to
glam up just for the night time I think
this is amazing so yes I would recommend
it I think you should definitely pick
one up just to have as an option for
that because it's incredible hopefully
that review was helpful for you guys and
if you're interested subscribe stay
tuned for more reviews and I'll catch
you guys soon bye
okay so I've done my makeup for the day
and the last thing I haven't done is
highlight or finishing powder or
whatever and I mentioned it a few reason
videos that I really don't pout or
powder my face anymore
I used to use like a mattifying powder
right here but I realized that that's
kind of what makes me look more youthful
and more awake and so when I powder that
little bit of grease away for me on my
skin I feel like it ends up looking just
dull especially in the winter when I'm
already dry so I really have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
