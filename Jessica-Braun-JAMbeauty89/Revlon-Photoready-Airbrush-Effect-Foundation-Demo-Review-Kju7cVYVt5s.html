thinking of it to me my audio it doesn't
work with Jessie anyway I am here to
bring your review of a foundation this
is the Revlon Photoready airbrush effect
makeup and I have it in the shade zero
zero two vanilla this is available in
drugstores I bought mine I think at
Walgreens but I'm looking online they
have twelve shades not very many darker
shades so if you're a darker gal or a
deeper skin gal you're probably not
going to have a lot of luck finding the
shade you need that seems to be true for
a lot of foundations which seems
ridiculous considering that's half of
the population like it doesn't make any
sense to me but anyway the price point
of this varies depending on where you
buy it you can get it at Walmart
Walgreens CVS for around twelve to
thirteen dollars of course if you've got
coupons or their sales that'll be even
cheaper on ulties website it's like
$14.99 so unless there's a sale I
wouldn't buy it there but what I love
about the packaging is that it's got a
pump and it's got a lid for that pump so
it's not accidentally getting pressed
like if you travel with it it's in a
glass jar and it comes with one fluid
ounce which is typical of most drugstore
foundations so I'm going to show you a
demo of me applying it today I am
wearing it today and I wanted you to see
how it applies both with my hand and
with the brush so let's go ahead and get
into the demo so I'm going to apply half
of my face with this with my hand and
the other half with a brush this is an
it cosmetics brush that I love it's
really really expensive you can use Real
Techniques as an amazing face brush elf
has amazing ones they call it their
powder brush but it's really good for
foundation there's a lot of really
inexpensive options that are great I
don't use the Beauty Blender a lot for
my foundation trials just because most
people in the world that are looking for
reviews don't own one of those so I
don't like to use them all the time in
these although I do love them however
this is more of a liquidy consistency
and I don't love the way it applies with
a Beauty Blender anyway so I'm going to
try these two formats so I'm going to
pump a little bit in my hand this is in
the shade zero zero two vanilla by the
way and I'm just going to kind of dot it
all over
so I'm going to do this half with my
hand and it is a little bit darker than
my skin tone and actually when I bought
this like a month ago I was darker
because I've been training outside a lot
more but a lot of its faded which is
just fine with me so it is a little bit
deeper than my skin tone but I don't
think it looks terrible however if this
is one that I love I might want to
invest in the one that's the one shade
lighter which would have to be zero zero
one so I'm noticing it really does give
like pretty good coverage
I mean comparing it to this side with no
coverage right now you can see my
freckles which is fine but you can see
some breakouts down here whereas here I
have a few breakouts you can still see
them but it is a lot it does look a lot
better it looks pretty nice I have to
admit it's not it's still a little bit
tacky and it's not a completely matte
finish but I don't love matte finishes
on foundation so let's try the other
side with the brush and again I'm just
going to kind of dot it all over the
place I got most of my forehead done and
that first one or most of my nose I
meant okay just kind of working it back
into my hairline should have pulled my
hair back but that's alright so I'm
thinking that it applies a lot more
flawlessly with my hand because I can
still see a little bit of the
hyperpigmentation this brush really does
I don't want to say shear out foundation
but it it really melts it into the skin
almost to the point where sometimes
depending on how liquid the foundation
is like this one is really liquidy it
will shear it out a little more so that
is one thing I would say this almost
applies the best with your hand I'm
going to apply just a little bit more to
those areas because this really is it
says photo-ready like it's a photo-ready
one but it does feel
like it's more I'm going to just do my
hand I would say max is medium coverage
I wouldn't consider this a high coverage
foundation but if you don't have huge
skin problems it's not going to be that
big of a deal now one thing I've noticed
with this and if you've watched any
reviews of this you know that it does
have like glitter in it and what usually
once it's set is when I really start to
see it it's not quite it's still a
little bit tacky but it does dry down
but there is a little bit of an element
of glitter to it so that's something to
keep in mind if you know you're going to
be in the Sun that glitter is going to
really show through and not necessarily
in a great way unless you don't mind
that but it would be everywhere you put
the foundation so that's something to
keep in mind so clearly it applies well
I would say it's got medium coverage
give or take and of course you can build
it I mean it covers everything I need to
cover but if you do have a lot of you
know scarring issues or anything like
that this probably is not a good choice
for you I love the packaging as I
mentioned earlier it's so cute the pump
is so easy you can really control how
much comes out which is really nice but
the glitter effect really kind of drives
me bonkers not I mean from here like
even looking in my mirror from here I
can't see it but when you're up close
you can see it and when you're in the
sunlight you can see it and it's very
rare for you to not you know at least
for me I leave the house and so the
sun's hitting me and even in the car I
see it and I'm like oh my gosh I look
insane so for me I don't think this is a
great option I don't know if it's really
a wonderful option for anyone I guess if
you were truly it does look nice and
photos and the only thing that confuses
me is that it's got an SPF of 20 SPF and
foundations can tend to flash back if
you're in flash photography so you end
up looking like ghost like a white cast
is over your face in the photos now SPF
20 is a little bit lower so I don't know
if there would be as much flash back but
it's just something to keep in mind it
seems odd that in a photo ready
foundation that they would have any SPF
you'd think they wouldn't so um that was
kind of
to me as to the airbrush effect quality
of it or at least it says I think the
glitter is supposed to defuse the light
and that's why it makes it look more
airbrush but I wouldn't say that it's
anything better than like the Revlon
Colorstay whipped that I love or
anything like that it doesn't feel tacky
or anything like that it does at first
but it once it sets it's fine but I
would definitely recommend if you do own
this or if you're thinking about buying
it definitely cover it with the powder
so that it's not tacky anymore if you
need to apply blush right away or wait
for it to set before you apply any blush
or contour or highlight because it's
going to stick to any of those tacky
patches and just look kind of wonky I
will say to this foundation's credit
that when you wear it throughout the day
I've worn this off and on for the past
few weeks it doesn't end up looking
weird by the end of the day like a lot
of foundations do so it doesn't seem to
oxidize on me at all and now that I'm
seeing it with you know now that it's
set with all the rest of my makeup on I
think this color match actually is
pretty good for me too zero zero two
overall would I recommend this no I
can't put my GM Beauty stamp of approval
on it just because of that glitter um
that's pretty much the only reason it's
just if they hadn't had the glitter I
would love to see what this foundation
would be like because otherwise it's
nice and it doesn't break up and it
stays in place and it covers pretty well
and I love the packaging but that's the
I mean that's kind of a big deal to me
so other than that it's a good
foundation if you don't mind the glitter
then I would say go for it because it is
a good foundation other than that
hopefully this review is helpful for you
guys I have tons of other drugstore
foundation reviews if you're interested
in seeing the demos of those and my
review of them I will link my playlist
below and I hope you'll subscribe to
catch more and I'll catch you guys my
