to be sharing with you a review and
swatches of the brand-new Revlon
Colorstay not just nudes palettes I have
two of them
this one is passionate nudes and then
this one is romantic nudes
so let's go ahead and get into it so I'm
not gonna beat around the bush here I
was not very impressed with these I'll
show you the swatches let's start with
the passionate nudes this I'm wearing
these today I'll tell you that right now
so this top row here where there's this
gold this gold and this like kind of
amber bronzy gold are both like all over
my lid right now and then I use some of
this kind of matte medium brown in my
crease and then I used some of this
beige color like right under my brow
bone and kind of mix it all together I
just feel like they're like in both
palettes are like three or four really
good shades that I shouldn't even say
really good they're they're good but
then all the rest of them are pretty
much terrible so the ones that are
decently good kick up a lot of powder
which is fine except for you have to be
really careful with it and then the ones
that are really bad are just really bad
like they just don't show up at all but
then there are some that are okay like
these too so you'll see in the swatches
for these some of them are nice and
pigmented the other ones kind of aren't
some of them took like quite a few
swatches back and forth back to the
palette and then back to the swatch
because it just was so hard to build up
and it's even harder to build up with a
brush
they blend okay but even that I wouldn't
say that's a big strength of these
palettes let's look at the other one
this one is romantic nudes this one has
more less of those warm neutrals and
more of like the purpley pink tights
shades I love the look of this and like
this
kind of maroon or like a burnt color is
really really pretty the purples and the
pink and this are actually really pretty
but they just don't I don't know like I
feel like these are around $15 of course
you can get them on sale but they're
around $15 for that amount you can get
like shadow palettes on HauteLook for
like 50
sent off and get really good shadows
from a name-brand or you could just save
up and maybe you know wait a little bit
and buy a little bit nicer of one
because these were just I mean I
wouldn't even waste my money at all I
can if I didn't have a YouTube channel I
would have already returned these if I
could but you know since IV tube channel
I like to have these things on hand for
a little while they answer questions for
you guys to show you any more about them
if you wanted to know more if you were
to buy one
I can't even recommend one I really
can't because like obviously if you're
more into the pinks and purples then
you'd want this one or just neutrals and
golds but even still they're just not
good enough to buy you guys I'm telling
you just stay away
I like the L'Oreal the palettes better
than these it was kind of a similar deal
where some of them just weren't as
pigmented as others but that one had way
more that were really good and the ones
that were really good were fantastic
whereas the best ones in here just kind
of like hmm okay the packaging on the
outside is cute but on the inside it
comes with this little brush of the dual
ended brush it's just kind of you know
about what you would expect just like a
synthetic very rubbery type brush but
the actual packaging here is just like a
squishy it's just like a cheap plastic
not like cheap plastic like the outside
I mean like it's like those things you
get from like color mate when you were
10 from like for Christmas and it's like
the big huge thing of all these colors
and you can take it out and it's like
that flimsy plastic it's like that so I
would I couldn't I'm gonna be honest I
could not believe that for $15 they
couldn't afford to make this at least a
substantial inner part so that was kind
of upsetting to find to be honest with
you I really don't have much more to say
I know that I don't typically do
negative videos like this but I are so
unbelievably unimpressed I had to tell
you guys before you go out you know with
new pallets like this we all go a little
crazy and we all go out and buy them but
I really would stay away tell your
friends tell your wives tell your
husband's tell your kids nobody go buy
this so hopefully that was helpful even
though it was a little bit more
glass-half-empty versus glass-half-full
if you know that idiom but other than
that I hope that you'll catch some of my
other reviews some that are a lot more
positive I will link my playlist of
drugstore reviews down below and I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
