going to do a review and swatches of one
of my favorite line of lipsticks it is
the Revlon Super Lustrous line and these
have been around for like 70 years and
they have I think over like 80 shades in
their range right now or at least close
to 80 they've got a ton and they have
them all organized into different lines
so I'm going to go through all of that
with you including the price and the
swatches on my lips and everything like
that so let's go ahead and get into it
so like I said they have four different
lines within their Super Lustrous
lipstick line and the four ones they
have they say our cream matte pearl and
shine now I have some of the creams some
of the matte I think I have a let's see
matte cream cream cream pearl so I do
have one pearl and I don't have any of
the shine ones I'm not really big if I
want to shine on my lips I will I would
rather just add a lip gloss rather than
have like a slippery lipstick on but I
really like the cream in the matte one
so let's go ahead and get into the
swatches of the one two three four five
six seven different shades that I have
and then we'll talk about everything
else that has to do with these lipsticks
so as you can see I have a lot of
different colors I've got some really
deep berry tones this deep red but then
I also have some peachy some Pink's
these for the most part are all amazing
there was only one out of the ones I own
and I think it's called a stormy pink
that when I put it on my lips I almost
struggled to get it completely even and
it was this matte shade and stormy pink
and I'll swatch it for you guys if I
just put one swatch you can kind of see
it's like kind of not opaque at all and
it's just kind of splotchy
and that's it looks a little better as
you layer it and I layered probably
eight layers just to get it to look
where it was even and not patchy so this
is the only shade out of the ones I own
that I probably wouldn't recommend I
just recently bought it and I just as
I've used it more I just haven't been
very impressed but the rest of them I
would recommend to anyone they're
amazing
one of them is called pink in the
afternoon and that one I'm on Revlon's
official website and it's not listed so
I think it's been discontinued however I
just saw this at a store near me called
Meyer &amp;amp; CVS within the past few weeks so
I think it's been discontinued but a lot
of stores still have it so if you want
to look if you
that shade go ahead and look you might
be able to find it you just probably
won't be able to buy it again after that
it's one of my favorite shades I've used
it to death it's just that beautiful
kind of warm pink shade the price point
on these can vary depending on the store
you're at at Walmart and Target these
are $4.99 regular price whereas at Ulta
they're $7.99 online so now all of the
stores accept coupons and their sales
and things that go on so you can always
get it for cheaper I usually when I'm
buying one I usually buy two and I just
wait for like a buy one get one free or
buy one get one half off staple and I'll
use the coupon so these are an amazing
deal for what they are and they really
are Revlon's kind of legendary lipstick
the one that like it's just never left
their line and I love that they have
something that's been around for so long
one thing I love about these is that
they don't have a detectable smell I
feel like there's so many like the
Milani ones I love the formula and this
is absolutely another wonderful
drugstore lipstick if Milani is sold
near you they're really really pigmented
they're beautiful just like these but
they have this smell that I just can't
handle some people love it it's kind of
like a cucumber watermelon scent and I
for whatever reason it makes me sick
I've gotten rid of all but this one
because they have a matte line and the
matte ones don't smell like that but
their other ones are amazing that they
smell so I'm thankful that these really
don't have a smell like that at all
these they're you know when I'm putting
them on my lips other than that one
they're so creamy I never feel like I'm
pulling at them they go exactly where I
want them to go I almost never need to
wear a lip liner with them and I didn't
with any of these because they just go
where you want them to go and they're
not like running outside your lip line
at all it's just they're so comfortable
to wear comfortable to put on
I love reapplying them these aren't like
these aren't going to last you all day
but they do last longer than really any
other drugstore lipstick I've tried but
I like reapplying these because they're
so comfortable overall would I recommend
these I think you can guess that of
course I would find a shade that looks
great on you there are a ton of other
swatch videos here on YouTube where they
do even more colors I watched a few of
those when I was first getting these a
couple years ago just to get an idea of
what shades I would actually like to
kind of start out my collection
then now I've just gone out and looked
and just found some that sounded
interesting and try to mount on my own
so definitely one of the most iconic
ones is the cherries in the snow the one
I'm wearing now I feel like Taylor Swift
when I wear I love this shades so much
another one that I think is really cool
is this purple one called berry hot and
it is purple like I've mentioned
recently it is purple but it's such a
beautiful fall shade if you like a berry
shade on your lips other than that the
peach me one I think is fun this is the
one that's a pearl it does have that
kind of Sheen to it that is not true for
the cream or the matte ones clearly the
cream and the matte ones are my favorite
I would recommend the cream over any of
them is this cherries in the snow and
cream yeah because they have just a
little bit of luster but they're almost
matte it's the PERT it bridges the gap
perfectly the cream ones I've never had
a cream lipstick from this line that was
bad so those I know are really
trustworthy ones if you're just dipping
your toe in the water with these so I
will stop blabbering about them
definitely check out other videos on
here on YouTube there are some amazing
ladies out there that have also done
amazing swatch videos of these I know I
love watching them too hopefully this
was helpful for you guys and if you
enjoyed please subscribe and I can link
my other review and swatch videos of
other lipsticks that I've done down
below if you're interested then I'll
catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
