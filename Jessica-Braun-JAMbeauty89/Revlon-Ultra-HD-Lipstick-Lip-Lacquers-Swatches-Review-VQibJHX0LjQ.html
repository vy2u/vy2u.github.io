bringing you a double review and demo
today I will be reviewing the brand new
Revlon Ultra HD lipsticks and I will
also be reviewing the Revlon Ultra HD
lip lacquers I have two shades of each
of them the lipstick shades I have are
sweet pea and Magnolia and I will show
myself applying these here in just a
second so you can see what they look
like on the lips as they apply I'm
wearing right now the sweet pea one
which is a nice pink and then the lip
lacquers that I have I have petal light
which is this more coral shade and then
I also have pink diamond which I'm
actually wearing on the center of my lip
here which I will also show you what
these look like as I apply them to my
lips and lip swatches of these so let's
go ahead and get into it so this first
one is called pink diamond and it's kind
of the lightest of them and I've
literally never even opened this so it's
got a brush applicator and it does have
like a pearly finish to it so let's see
how it applies whoa
Wow so this one I think it's so
iridescent I think this would be nice
either over a matte lipstick that you're
wanting to kind of amp it up or even
like revive it maybe your part way
through the night and you for some
reason forgot the lipstick and you can't
reapply but you need to kind of add some
life to it and mix that around I think
this would be great for that it's a
really pretty color but with my skin
tone I think it just kind of but I think
this would be an amazing almost tool to
have in your makeup collection to use
just in the center of your bottom lip to
make your lips look a little more
dimensional a little bit plumper because
it is so iridescent and it would kind of
blend with any color you've got on not
any but a lot of colors so I think
that's probably how I will use this
because I do think it's really pretty
but I think I need something under maybe
even if I just colored my lips with a
liner and then use this on top to add
some dimension because it is beautiful
these are well when I was putting them
on they felt sticky but I don't feel
that they're really sticky now they
don't feel I mean they're a little bit
but it's not I mean I've had way
stickier so I think these are kind of
in-between sickie and not sticky they're
sticky ish but I do think that's how I'm
gonna use this one this next one is
called petal light gets its a mix
between petal and socialite I don't know
okay
I think this one is much more my speed
it's got a little bit more of a peachy
coral look to it but you can see look
it's like kind of weird because of its
consistency so I think you either have
to apply less or more but you have to
kind of all set your finger make sure
it's like kind of blended in because
it's not it is a little bit stickier
than a traditional cloth because it's
it's kind of a cross between a lacquer
and a gloss I guess is what I'm
realizing because you can wear them
alone and it looks fine like especially
this one looks a lot better than the
other one does alone but I do think they
would probably be more ideal on top of
something else but I do like this color
a lot more I think this one looks a lot
better on its own like I mentioned and I
think it is pretty so this one is in the
shade Magnolia and I'll say right off
the bat the packaging I don't love
because the lipstick comes up higher
than the actual like bullet that it's in
and so it's more apps to get on the cap
when you're closing it which drives me
bonkers but this is more of it looks
like a peachy neutral shade so let's see
how they supply
so this one seems I mean I want to see
okay so swatch on my hand it's like this
because this is so similar to my own lip
color it doesn't quite show up as almost
you can't tell that it's this pigmented
with one swipe but it is it's just
really close but if your lip color is
different this would certainly be a lot
more peachy on you and I do think this
would look a little bit more cleaned up
if I had a liner underneath it which is
how I'd probably wear it but it went on
really really smoothly like it just
glided right on and it it's very
comfortable it doesn't feel sticky but
it doesn't feel like you've got a thick
layer either it's just comfortable I
don't really know how else to describe
it and it feels like I have the thinnest
layer on ever but it is a really really
pretty color so the next shade is in the
shade sweet pea
so this one is a lot more of a bright
pink but it's like a wearable pink it
looks a lot brighter and let's look at a
swatch of this yeah I mean it's watches
it is a bright pink but I think it's a
lot more wearable of a pink than some
bright Pink's that are out there but you
can see how soft these are because look
just from watching it that little bit
it's kind of gone down so these are
really soft which I like but they say
put on your lips it's kind of crazy and
I wanted to try just while we're at it
using that light pink lip lacquer in
pink diamond right in the center of this
to see if it makes them look a little
more 3-dimensional I think that is
really nice just sticking it on the
center and I went out a little too far
but just sticking it on the center it
really does make this look a lot more
put together I think don't you agree so
let's go ahead and go through the lip
gloss pros and cons and then the
lipstick pros and cons the lip gloss is
these are $8.99 where I bought them at
Walgreens but they were buy one get one
50% off you can usually find them
cheaper with sales with coupons and
sometimes they're just cheaper in
general like online or like if you have
a Meijer near you they're always cheaper
there I will say I love the packaging I
at first didn't like them because I'm
not a big silver person but I do think
the diamonds on top are pretty cute but
I don't think it's anything
revolutionary by Revlon standards at all
I mean I would almost rather have the
gold that Revlon usually uses to be
honest but regardless the brush
applicator is something that is typical
of lip lacquers because lacquers are
more of a usually a thicker consistency
but not only that but usually they pack
a lot more punch when it comes to
pigmentation I do think these are pretty
pigmented but honestly I wouldn't
consider these a lip lock er they're
more of a cross like I mentioned in the
demo I think these are more of a cross
between a lip gloss and a lip lacquer
like kind of bridging the gap so if you
know that you want something a little
more like a lip lacquer but you don't
want something like that's just boom in
your face these would be a great option
but if you're wanting one or the other I
don't think these are ideal for either
one to be honest with you I think that
formula wise they stay on pretty well
but I think they are not necessarily
sticky but I would say goopy and the
difference I mean is that if it were
sick II I would feel like my lips are
sticking together or anything but goopy
I just find that like it'll kind of goop
up in certain sections of my lips and
I've even noticed that it's bent on my
teeth a little bit like quite a few
times before filming I was like gosh
like why is that my teeth again and I
kept you know doing that trick but it
kept getting on my teeth and I have an
experience that with very many lip
products to be honest so that kind of
turned me off all in all do I think
these are worth it mmm
I think it's a pass I don't think
there's anything revolutionary or
amazing or anything about these I will
say I do like like I mentioned the pink
diamond in the center of a lip to make
it because it is so iridescent it does a
really nice job of making it look more
3d and voluptuous for your lips honestly
I really like the NYC liquid lip shines
and these are like two or three dollars
I found mine at the Dollar Tree so I
think that's a good drugstore option if
you're looking for like a crazy lip
lacquer I think that the Revlon show off
ones or apocalypse if you live in the UK
I think these are an amazing option and
they have like their matte line which
are their lip Velvets and then they have
their regular which are a little bit
glossy err I don't think these are the
most long-lasting thing in the world but
I do think they are very vibrant exactly
what you want if you want something just
in your face so I think these are a
better option I also would recommend the
NYX lip glosses any of them I mean
they've got the shorter like the butter
glosses or what are these called yeah
they're butter glosses have some color
but there's still a little sheer but I
really like the NYX mega shine gloss is
my favorites in beige which is like
honestly it kind of looks like this but
a little bit deeper so there are so many
better drugstore options for lip gloss
and lip lacquers that I think you should
just avoid the Revlon ones now let's get
into the Ultra HD
lipsticks I liked these better than the
lip glosses that's what I will start
with these are also $8.99 at Walgreens
you can probably find them cheaper
online or with coupons and things like
that and they were also on sale buy one
get one 50% off they had a lot more
shades they had a lot of deeper shades
which I think would be really pretty if
that's what you're into I have a lot of
deep shades so
I didn't want to buy too many of them
especially since I didn't know if I
would like these I don't really know how
I feel about these I'm gonna be honest I
think the fact that I'm not a hundred
percent like Wow makes me think that
maybe I'm not a big fan of these I mean
again I just don't think these are
anything revolutionary they're not like
completely opaque they do look beautiful
swatch but I don't think they look as
beautiful on your lips even the one that
you know the nude one I mentioned is
close to my lip color so it wasn't as
obvious to me but even this pink one in
Sweet Pea I felt you know it's the
claims on these lipsticks is that it's
like one swipe and you're done it's just
so pigmented but it's penguin to me you
can kind of see there is a little bit of
Sheerness to it and that's with two
swipes one swipe is like that so I don't
know if you're looking for something
kind of in between I don't know but I
don't know anyone that really is these
remind me of their lip butters in a way
but a little less glittery but they're
just kind of hmm I don't recommend them
I really think that drugstore lipstick
wise the Revlon ones are really really
nice and they're even cheaper and so
like this is Primrose which is a really
pretty pink shade and they just don't
move
they're so much higher quality and
they're a couple dollars cheaper this is
my favorite pink in the afternoon I've
mentioned a lot lately and they're just
crazy pigmented almost creamy and they
have different like they've got matte
ones cream ones lustrous lustrous ones
they've got I mean oh my gosh they have
like a hundred colors it's amazing and
there I just like them in the packaging
I think is cuter and again with the
packaging of the Revlon once you get the
lipstick on the things like the wet and
wild Meg last ones where they're higher
than the actual bullet so then it gets
on the actual lid and that makes me
cuckoo so those are my two cents on
these I'm sure that there are other
shades there that are probably maybe a
little bit better I know that when it
comes to any makeup product different
shades work differently some of them
have a
little bit different of a formula to
have gotten that color shade so some of
them are better than others and I'm
aware of that I don't think they're the
worst things in the world but I
certainly wouldn't put my jam' beauty
stamp stamp of approval on it and good
conscious knowing that I really am NOT a
huge fan of them so hopefully this
review is helpful for you guys if you'd

products and other products that I do
