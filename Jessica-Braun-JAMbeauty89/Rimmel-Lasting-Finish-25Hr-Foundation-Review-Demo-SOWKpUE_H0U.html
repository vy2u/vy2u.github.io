bringing you a review of the Rimmel
lasting finish 25 hour foundation now I
have mine in the shade 101 classic ivory
they have seven different shades in
their range in these range in price from
like $5 to $8 depending on where you get
it let's go ahead and get into the demo
of me applying this to my face I'm
wearing it today so you can kind of see
what it looks like when it goes on your
face both with my hand on one side of my
face and then with a brush on the other
side and then afterwards I'll get into
the pros and cons of whether or not I
would recommend this and some more nitty
gritty details about it so let's go
ahead and get started so so far I've
applied my ELF nourishing night cream I
like this better than the elf day cream
so I use this during the day too I just
kind of use it all around I really
really like it so I've already applied
that and it's already sunk into my face
I've actually already done my hair today
so I'm just gonna kind of hold it back
out of the way for me to apply so it's
not getting all up in nail so I'm going
to do this half of my face with my hand
and this half of my face with a brush
and the brush I'm going to use is it it
cosmetics one I'll put the name of it
here on the screen because it doesn't
say it on there but I can't stop using
it and I think I usually use foundation
brushes that are a lot more dense than
this but there's something about it that
it's just flawless and it's the most
flawless finish I've ever gotten with a
brush so I'm really excited about this
present so let's go ahead and start with
this I'm not going to do a primer today
just because I want to see how this
foundation looks without any primer just
going to kind of dot it it is a little
deeper than my skin tone but honestly I
bought it because it was more yellow
base than the other one they had which
is what I need so um but there's I love
this foundation I'm going to tell you
guys right now so this is what it looks
like with your hand it's so creamy and
satiny and smooth and it has this kind
of fresh scent to it that I like I think
it is kind of a strong scent so it
maybe something worth smelling yourself
before you buy it because you might not
like it but I like the smell and it just
instantly gets rid of a lot of my
hyperpigmentation like so quickly so
let's go ahead I'm going to dot some
more on the other side and let's see how
it looks with a brush there side in the
nose
so what I'm noticing is that I think it
pretty much looks the same on both sides
I'm getting more light coming from this
side so if you're seeing shadows and
stuff that would be why cuz I'm kind of
turned away from the window but straight
from the window I just I think it is
absolutely amazing and I've got a lot of
blemishes from breakouts that have
healed but they are kind of not staining
but they're kind of they've kind of left
dark marks and I think it does a pretty
good job I might end up using another
concealer but I would say that the
finish of this is satiny definitely but
it's not like you can tell it just gives
your skin this really nice glow and I
just oh my gosh I love it so much it
does take about one more minute so maybe
two or three minutes total to completely
set on the face you don't want to put
like a powder right on your face right
away because it might get patchy because
it is a little tacky but after about one
more minute it sets to be the most
beautiful satin finish I've never had a
foundation that looks exactly like what
I want it to look like and I'm so
excited to finish the rest of my face
you guys can see what this looks like
kind of with a blush and everything like
that so I ended up applying one more
layer just to get rid of a little more
hyperpigmentation just to show you that
this really can be I would say it's a
medium to high coverage and it can be
very high coverage if you want it to be
and yet it still doesn't look cakey even
up close
it doesn't look cakey I I mean it is
just amazing I love this foundation I
love it so much I loved it back when it
was in like a squeezy tube formula I'm
assuming it's the same product because
it looks exactly the same on my skin it
has the same smell but now it's just in
this glass packaging which I would much
rather it either be a squeezy tube or a
pump but I think I might put this into a
pump that a subscriber sent me that I
could use regardless this foundation it
only has seven shades and they don't go
much deeper than like nothing it doesn't
go deep at all so if you have darker
skin or I mean gosh they really do not
have a big shade range so that is a huge
huge con when it comes to this although
a huge pro is that it is so inexpensive
even in the realm of drugstore
foundations this is still really cheap
because there are some drugstore
foundations that are like 12 or 13
dollars it's starting to bridge into
like higher end but regardless the price
is a huge Pro a similar product to this
I think would be the Revlon age-defying
foundation and I love that this as a
pump but I like this more the agent fine
I like because it does give more of a
satin finish however I do notice that it
clings to dry patches just a tiny bit
whereas this I mean it is not only
flawless but it doesn't cling to dry
patches at all I have dryness here and
even up close you can't see them I am so
floored with the way that this
foundation looks on the skin I mentioned
the smell in my demo and it does I don't
know how to describe the smell I'm being
honest with you guys it's like it kind
it has kind of a almost like laundry
detergent in a way I don't that probably
sounds like a bad thing I don't mind the
smell but I think some people might not
like it so again like I mentioned it
might be worth smelling in the store to
see if you it would bother you but once
it's on your skin you don't smell it so
as long as you can handle smelling it
for a few minutes when you're applying
it you're fine because I you know you
can't smell it at all as I mentioned the
coverage of this I would rank as medium
high almost high coverage I mean I
didn't need to spot conceal anything on
my face
other than my under eye obviously so I
really think that this is absolutely
medium to high coverage can be high
coverage if you want to throw on one
more layer it is sticky when you first
apply it but as long as you give it time
to set in to your skin before you apply
any sort of powder it works wonderfully
but you do have to give it that two or
three minutes because if you don't it
you know if you try to apply blush right
on top of it right away
it would stick in a patch because that
would be the way with anything that has
that sticky quality to it so give it
time and it's good to go
I think you can't go wrong applying this
anyway it's one of the few foundations I
own that you can apply it with your
hands and it looks flawless you can
apply it with a brush and it looks
flawless you can apply with a beauty
loader it looks laws it looks flawless
no matter how you apply it which is so
amazing if you're traveling you don't
have to worry about bringing a brush I
think that I might wear this on my
wedding day I was originally going to
wear my Rev
Colorstay whipped because i love it but
this is so much better
you guys this might be my favorite
foundation of all time it lasts all day
on the skin I didn't wear a primer with
this honestly I don't think I will wear
a primer with it because it doesn't need
it it didn't need any help
I'm just so floored and I've been
wearing this now for like a month off
and on and I've kind of seen how it
wears when I go on a run because I'm
training for a mini marathon when I'll
go on a run it'll stay on flawlessly it
just I swear as you wear it throughout
the day it ends up looking more and more
beautiful and more and more just like
your natural skin so if that tells you
anything I would probably wear this on
my wedding day I probably will that
should tell you everything you need to
know about this foundation I love it the
only thing that would hold me back is
that it does have a sunscreen which is
great for every day but for flash
photography I don't know that would work
so that would be the one thing that
would hold me back from maybe wearing
this on my wedding day I'm gonna have to
test it out and see with flash
photography beforehand to see okay is it
that bad does it bounce back or not so
I'll have to test it out before him it
says 25 hour I would believe it now most
people aren't wearing their foundation
for 25 hours obviously that's more than
an entire day but I love the idea behind
it it really lasts all day it doesn't
break up it doesn't oxidize I don't know
what they have in this stuff but it's
crazy it is crazy see the other huge Pro
can you tell I'm like gushing I haven't
felt this way about a foundation it's so
long and I'm so excited to share it with
you guys
but another pro is that you can buy this
anywhere I bought it at a store know me
called Meyer they sell it at Walgreens
CVS online you can buy it at Ulta you
can buy it in store it alte Rimmel has
coupons out all the time their sales all
the time right now as I'm looking at it
it's like a dollar or two off on Ulta
calm so I can link it below if you
wanted to purchase it online overall
would I recommend it I think you can
tell it's a resounding yes I can't say
enough good things again the only cons
are that the shade range is so small but
if you can find your shade range I think
you will absolutely love it they do even
for lighter skinned owls this is the
third shade up which is very rare for me
to get because I am really fair but it
had a more yellow tint to it which for
me is exactly what I need so that worked
out but they do have
lighter one that has more of a pink tint
to it so you can kind of see what you
think but I like I'm running out of
things to say about it it is so amazing
if you are looking for a new foundation
I would recommend it to the moon and
back I would recommend that hopefully
