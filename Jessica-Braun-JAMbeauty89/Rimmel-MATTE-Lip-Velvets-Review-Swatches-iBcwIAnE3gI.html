give a quick review for the Rimmel
show-off lip lacquers but they're the
lip Velvets now I have tried their lip
lacquers which they have very similar
shade some of them even have kind of the
same name but they're just a little more
glossy these are the exact same
packaging they have the same applicator
where it's kind of a doe foot but
there's a little bit at the front that
kind of holds on to a lot of product so
it'll just kind of deposit it as you
apply it which is interesting and you
know I don't mind it I have two
different shades I have meteoric Matt
and then I also have atomic rose I'm
wearing meteoric map right now now these
retail for 499 at least at walgreens
where I bought them sometimes you can
find you know buy one get one half off
deals things like that so it's not a
huge investment they apply kind of I
would say they apply really evenly and
they do have a velvety feel but what
I've noticed as I where it is that they
wear off kind of odd it'll stay there
but you get that weird kind of ring on
the inside especially if it's a really
bold color like the one I'm wearing now
I don't find that you need a lip liner
with it i think the applicator allows
for a pretty precise application however
I do think a lip liner would help keep
it even as you wear it for a while this
is not something that I would trust all
day um you know glosses are great
because you can just wear them and if
they wear off it's not as super obvious
but something like this you do have to
reapply throughout the day and you have
to go into it just knowing that because
once it dries down it starts to get a
little creepy and a little odd after
really about the first 30 minutes if not
hours so if you go into it knowing that
then you won't be let down but if you
expect these to last you all day and
look flawless for even three hours
you're going to be let down what I will
say while I'm not a big fan of the
Tomic rose color on my skin tone I think
it would look gorgeous it is a really
peachy color it was a gorgeous on darker
skin tones and deeper skin tones I love
the meteoric rose color I think it just
looks really nice with fair skin I think
it would look beautiful with darker I
think this is one that if you're going
for a very or a bold lip this is a great
option and I think it's a really just a
nice shade and I do like the way they
apply like I said you just have to make
sure you reapply them throughout the day
if you're going to wear it all day smell
wise I didn't notice really an odd smell
I think overpowering or anything like
that I know sometimes rimmel's lip
products can have an overpowering smell
at least I felt that way but these
didn't have an offensive smell to me
these really do apply really pigmented
if you look at the swatches here you'll
see that both of them are very very
opaque they just glide right on like
velvet and once they dry they are true
to color I mean they don't dry and train
change color anything like that they
stay true to their color I think these
are a really cool option I know that
matte lips are really in right now
obviously and I think this is just
something different that is offered out
there where you know there's tons of
matte lip products out there that kind
of give that Matt look but they're
incredibly drying but these give that
Matt look without being as drawing as a
lot of the matte lip products are that
are out there so I think if you've been
looking for a matte lip
and you found that a lot of the ones
you've tried or drying this might be a
good option for you but like I said I
really don't love the way they wear off
throughout the day keep your eyes peeled
for coupons for these rimmel's sometimes
we'll have like a dollar off coupon in
places and these are kind of hard to
define since they are new so just look
on end caps I got mine at walgreens CVS
most likely has them by now overall
would I recommend these yes but I say
that yes like that because if you
already have matte lip products you love
I don't think this is something you need
to rush out and get I don't think it's a
must-have product but if you are looking
for a pretty Barry matte lip color I
would recommend this color because I
think it's beautiful and if you film
like I do it's a great one on film and
um you know I think these are nice but I
don't think they're a must-have so I'll
just leave it at that hopefully that
review is helpful for you guys if you'd
like to see more reviews of new drug
store lip products stay tuned because
I've got a lot coming up and a lot of
them are Matt options so stay tuned
subscribe and I'll catch you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
