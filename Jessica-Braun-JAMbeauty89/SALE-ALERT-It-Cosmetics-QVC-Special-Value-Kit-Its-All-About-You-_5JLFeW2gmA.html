to let you guys know about this QVC deal
that's going on now I'm on the it
cosmetics like PR mailing list I guess I
mean I'm assuming that's what it is
so I from time to time get sent anything
new that's about to be launched on QVC's
website when it comes to like an it
cosmetics kit and that is so exciting
and so I'm just I'm constantly thankful
for it because this is amazing to get to
try these things out and to let you guys
know about them kind of as they're
happening and I am so thankful but of
course that being said I'm not being
sponsored by them so there's no benefit
to me by being dishonest with you guys
about us you guys know I'm gonna be
honest with you whether I were sponsored
or not I'd be honest but so just know
I'm going to give you my honest two
cents on whether or not I think this kit
is worth it if the products are nice or
not now it cosmetics I tried quite a bit
of their stuff and to be quite candid
I've loved virtually every single thing
I tried I say virtually because I can't
think of any off the top of my head but
there have been a few that either the
shade wasn't right or I couldn't even
find a shade that would match me because
when it comes to their face products
they pretty much only have like four or
five shades and that's kind of that so
that is the one downside however they
did give me the right shade for this
because they give me the wrong shade for
Lila anyway the kid is called it's all
about you and it comes with four
different things it's only available on
June 8th so if you're watching this on
June 8th jackpot you can check the link
below and check it out
I don't know if it'll still be available
maybe for a little bit higher of a price
a lot of times they'll do that so
definitely check it out even if it's not
June 8th just in case what comes with it
I was very excited so it comes in a box
like this so you see it and I've already
taken everything out because I wanted to
show it to you guys but it comes with
this award-winning must-haves palette
you'll see it comes with a bye-bye
under-eye concealer the celebration
foundation it's like a pressed powder
foundation with SPF 50 and then this
dual ended brush you will see in a
second so the first thing I wanted to
show you is really hard to show you
because it's all mirrored but it's
called their natural naturally pretty
face palette and it comes with four of I
guess their best sellers and I'm trying
so this is their bye bye pores pressed
powder now I have their bye-bye pores
like loose powder and it's amazing for
like setting your under-eye or you could
put it all over and it really does kind
of give your skin a flawless finish and
it's translucent but this is the pressed
version and I was so excited I didn't
even know that existed
so I set my under eyes with this today
and I really really liked it this is a
cream what was the shade I think it says
it on here it's called a Hello light and
it's a cream product and it's a
highlight and you can kind of see it
definitely definitely is a highlight and
I applied it to the apple of my herb I
mean above the apple of my cheeks today
and kind of above my cheekbone I used
like an elf stipple brush but it this is
really nice now that I'm kind of seeing
it it really is a nice I'm not big on
cream highlights but this does blend
really easily so you don't feel like
you've just got a strip you can kind of
blend it down into it you know whatever
you need to do but I really like the
look it gives then they've got their
powder which is their vitality matte
bronzer did I say powder I'm it bronzer
it is a powder and then they also have
their what is this one called
they also have their bye-bye pores press
blush and it's in this shade Jenna say
quoi which they have quite a few
products in that shade with that shade
name but I was going to apply my blush
is kind of worn off a little bit today
so I was gonna I'm actually using an it
cosmetics brush I can't stop using this
one just to the apples of my cheeks it's
a really nice pink color and I don't
really nice well that's really pink in
person you should see it so you got to
kind of use a light hand I'm learning in
person on camera I don't think it looks
that crazy but it is a really pretty
pink color and if you're my shade I
think it looks really nice now the other
thing that this kit comes
is this double-ended brush and what do
they call it their heavenly lux
complexion perfection brush and it's
supposed to be used with their
foundation and concealer so I actually
use it to apply foundation today I'm
just going to use it there's still some
foundation on to kind of blend that just
a little bit but I also use the small
brush these are really soft synthetic
brushes I have love like I was telling
you this blush brush doesn't come with
this it came separately they sent it to
me it is it's the best I don't know what
it's called though but I love their
brushes so I was excited to get this
I don't like dual-ended brushes to be
honest because I never know how to store
them I don't like storing them in a
drawer if I'm gonna use it but then I if
I put it in a cup I'm kind of
sacrificing one end so I know some
people like tape them to the side of
their stuff but I don't know anyway but
I use this side to blend in the
concealer which I'm wearing their
concealer today and that's another thing
that it came with which is the bye-bye
under-eye I got to show you guys this
stuff in action I'm not gonna put it
back on because I've already powdered it
and stuff this stuff you use like the
tiniest tiniest amounts just to squeeze
YouTube this isn't the shade light so
I'm gonna put it down there you see how
little that tiny tiny amount well look
at how brightening this is it's a very
thick concealer but it brightens so
amazingly and it it always surprises me
because every time I wear it I look in
the mirror and I expect you know maybe a
couple hours later I expect that
whatever can see I'm wearing has kind of
settled a little bit this stuff is crazy
I don't know what's in it I hope it's
good for my skin I assume it is because
most of their products are but it just
stays put and especially if you I mean I
usually set whatever concealer I'm
wearing so I've never really worn it
without setting it with at least some
sort of powder but it's just amazing and
it's so brightening out like I said I'm
wearing today if it doesn't have SPF I
might end up wearing it on my wedding
day because it really does not move
through
the day it is so high coverage I really
like the way it looks when I wear it so
I was very excited to get that and so
I'm talked about the brush the kit in
the concealer the last thing that it
comes with is this celebration
foundation and I have it in the shade
fair now they would typically send me
light and that's just a little bit too
dark for me but it's just truly a it's
just a powder foundation I haven't
really tried this out this has SPF 50 so
of course I couldn't wear it with flash
photography but what an amazing thing to
have SPF that high of an SPF in your
powder so if you're wearing that
throughout the day you've got that extra
barrier of protection against the Sun I
thought that was pretty cool so a parent
I think this was a best seller without
the SPF but now they sell it with the
SPF which is what this comes with so my
only gripes with this would be that I
love mirror packaging it's pretty but
every little fingerprint shows which I
know sounds so silly for everyday it
doesn't matter but for me I'm just like
haha but beyond that like for the
concealer the brush and the palate alone
I think whatever the price is
it's probably an amazing deal and then
throw in this as well I mean these are
full-sized products they're amazing what
I've noticed about it Cosmetics kind of
across the board is that everything I've
ever worn from them has been extremely
long-lasting that's what I'll say so
even though like this I've never tried I
would have to assume if it's on par with
everything else that they have that it
would also be long lasting too I can
link my past eight cosmetic video where
I did a haul of a bunch of things they
had sent me it wasn't necessarily kit
just a bunch of different products I
will link that below if you're
interested in kind of learning more
about the company or about just other
things they sell outside of the QVC
umbrella I'll link that and if you enjoy
please subscribe and I'll catch you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
