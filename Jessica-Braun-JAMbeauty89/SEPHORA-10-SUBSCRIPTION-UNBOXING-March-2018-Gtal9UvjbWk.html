unbox my Sephora clay box for the month
of March they always send them to you
late and it's frustrating for someone
like me who does videos on them because
it's like I want you guys to be able to
see them as soon as possible but it's
like the end of March that I'm finally
able to film and get the video up and
it's like well now we're signing up for
the next box I don't know so $10 a month
it's an auto subscription on Sephora but
you can cancel at any time frankly it's
the easiest one to cancel I've ever been
a part of because it's just a part of
your Sephora account you know what I'm
saying so it's really easy to cancel so
you could try a month and then quit but
I will have a link for it below if
you're curious but let's go ahead and
open it so it's let's see kind of what
the theme is it says what's your
festival Beauty vibe guys who goes to
the festivals I have never been to a
festival and it's it's kind of funny I
have such weird feelings about it not
that I mean I I know people personally
that have gone to those kinds of
festivals it's not that it's more that
like it's just not a part of my
lifestyle and especially now being 29 I
feel like I'm kind of like even beyond I
don't know I'm not see I'm gonna offend
someone cuz someone's gonna be like 39
there I go - that's not what I mean
either I guess what I'm saying is it's
never really been a part of my like
wants or desires to go to a festival and
so it's always funny when people like
it's festival season and like all these
makeup companies do all these festival
focused things like two-face released
their festival line and I'm like but I I
don't care about festivals that is not a
part of my life now obviously that's
just one specific example am i even
making any sense am I just being a
Butthead pregnant Lee I think I'm just
being Moody okay pull it back just pull
it back so it comes with the 50 support
a little Oh Sephora beauty insider
points that you can add to your account
always comes with that which is nice and
we've got all this info here let's see
so the bag this month is like kind of
denim looking tie-dye and it says it
says beauty is my spirit animal so kind
of cute
feels like a pillowcase let's see first
thing ooh
one of my favorite hair care brands like
literally ever Brio geo it is their
blossom and bloom ginseng and biotin
volumizing spray hmm so it says it's a
dual action spray that provides instant
volume and texture is it visibly
thickened strands over time so it says
you could backcomb your roots so you get
like extra volume like for dry hair and
then it also says you can hold it a few
inches away spray through clean damp
hair focusing on the roots and then
brush through so it really is meant to
be focused on your roots let's get some
volume going girl I feel like it just
made it greasy I don't want to spray
anymore I don't know
this meant really it's a really pleasant
smell and the thing I love about Rio Gio
is they use virtually they use really
good ingredients they don't put a lot of
icky stuff in there and that I like and
that's why I've liked it actually my
shampoo I use today is their curling
shampoo and conditioner I can link it
below if you're curious and I do feel
like it makes a difference my hair air
dried today and it air dried much
curlier than usual which is really nice
so that I love their shampoos and
conditioners next up is the Sephora
brand triple action cleansing water so
it's a micellar water no rinse removes
makeup from your face and eyes and one
swipe so it says it removes impurities
that Susan moisturize your skin for a
super clean feeling without water so you
just put it on a cotton pad and wipe it
across your eyes or whatever so this is
25 mil so 0.84 fluid ounces no you know
no ridiculous smell or anything to it
I've taken to using these to remove
difficult swatches from my hand I don't
use my seller water on my face
typically not really for any reason I
don't think my my skin's fine with it
it's just that I'm really into cleansing
balms I feel like for my dry skin that's
helped a lot when I'm removing things
and
these don't really dry out your skin but
I don't think that they really add a ton
of moisture into your skin either
whereas those bombs kind of have that
moisture element to it so that's the
only reason that's my own personal
reason for using those but I will
definitely add this to my travel drawer
or maybe even my leg drawer with all my
makeup wipes so I can use it to remove
swatches because I want to see if it's
any good
mm-hmm you're kidding me this is a part
of the ultra 21 days of beauty sale and
I was thinking about buying the full
size of this but now I'm like well maybe
not cuz really I just wanted to try it
again it's been years since I've tried
it this is the Lancome Hypnose drama
mascara it's the deluxe size instead of
the full size you get about the same
amount of use as of out of a deluxe size
as you do a full size so I've never
really snobby about that because I mean
really this is gonna last me three
months full size is gonna last me three
months you know I don't want to open it
yet but it's got a big old wand supposed
to be really volumizing and curling
which is exactly what I want to mascara
I bought it years ago it was one of my
very first high-end purchases and I
remember liking it I remember buying it
more than once and I did not have a lot
of money to spare at the time but I
remember doing it anyway and I think it
was more because I felt glamorous like
I'm like oh they use this like models
use this backstage and I think I just
felt more glamorous using it whether or
not it actually performed really well I
don't know that it did I think there's a
reason eventually I moved on part of it
could have been I couldn't afford to
keep buying it so I will definitely try
it again and let you know but I think I
am gonna not buy the full size on Ulta
sale oh they always have a perfume
sample oh it fell out of here it's the
my Burberry blush let's see how this
smells I am really going through a
perfume kick right now I love the kind
of like light pinkish tan color oh it's
a very it smells nice I'm gonna put a
little on my actual skin because I want
to see how my skin reacts to it it does
it's a it's definitely a pleasant smell
but it's not one that this first time I
smelled I'm like oh my gosh I love it
you know there's some perfumes
you smell what is that that smells
amazing this is not one that I would do
that with but it's a very I'm gonna put
the notes on the screen so the notes it
says it is a floral one the top notes
are pomegranate pomegranate and lemon
okay
middle notes geranium Crisp apple rose
petal I can smell the rose and then base
notes are jasmine and wisteria sounds
amazing right I like it would I buy a
full-size of this I don't think so
and the thing I'm learning about perfume
is I like to spray it on my wrist and
smell it that way because it it really
does react with people's skin
differently I don't know if it has to do
with our pH I don't know what it has to
do with but I do know that you know
there are some perfumes like when I
first bought misty or one of my favorite
perfumes of all time that I always have
when I first smelled it I was like that
but I remember I sprayed it on my wrist
we were actually at Disney and we walked
around Epcot a little bit more and I
kept smelling I'm like this smells
amazing so we ended up going back later
and buying it and so it was and that was
completely based on the way it smelled
on me not the way it smelled on a tester
in the bottle or anything like that so I
do think it's just a very personal thing
so I like the smell but it's not one I
would buy the full size so I'll keep
smelling it we'll see I might change my
mind like I did with misty or next thing
in here is from Kula they make really
great SPF products that is their game
they are definitely a Sun care based
natural brand so it says it's a
refreshing setting spray and sunscreen
duo
it's got hyaluronic acid love that so
when you're in the Sun all day you need
a setting spray that gets the job done
hyaluronic acid infused formula works
overtime to defend against UV rays
here's the only thing I'd be concerned
about if this were the only SPF you were
using which I would hope it's not but if
it were I'd be concerned that it's not
going to be spread evenly everywhere so
the second I'm spraying something all
over my face I'd be worried about what
about those pockets in between am I
gonna have like this really weird
sunburn or you know what I'm saying so I
would not and this is me I'm not a
professional like dermatologist
just thinking logically about this I
would not use this as my only SPF that
day
now as added that's great because then
it's really quick and easy to apply you
can do it over your makeup which
actually now I'm saying that line that
is kind of a cool idea because like for
me when I'm getting ready I'll put the
SPF on and then put makeup and stuff on
top but I'm not gonna be able to go back
into that SPF and put it on on top of my
foundation you know what I'm saying so
this would be a great way to add
additional SPF throughout the day just
in case but it shouldn't be your base
sunscreen so I guess it does have a
place next up is the Sephora matte
perfection powder foundation okay I'm
gonna be a butt-head I know that this is
Deezer just deluxe sized samples but I
in the butt head that gets so mad when
we get papery little testers I'm like
what I know that if you average it out
10 dollars divided by 5 products 2 bucks
apiece I'm sure yes this is probably
worth $2 but it still annoys me I'm like
you know everyone else they can get
their cute little bottles and stuff can
we get like something that's not like
can we get something a little more
substantial am I just being again am I
just being Moody okay um so it looks
like shade wise did they just send
everyone the same shade or did they this
is 26 neutral sand it's not gonna be my
shade but who but it is rule creamy see
this is how they get you because oh my
gosh like I now want to go find my shade
and try it it's really really velvety
soft and I love powder foundations like
that especially again if you have areas
that you feel like no matter what
throughout the day always redness might
show through or the foundation breaks
apart powder foundation is perfect
because you can just dot it on those
areas with the brush or with a sponge
and it just covers them makes them look
flawless and you didn't have to get out
of foundation and do all of that cuz who
has time for that throughout the day if
you're on the go so I'm actually quite
intrigued I might pop onto Sephora's
website and add this to my loves to
think about trying legitimately but with
my shade darkness Sephora there I was
complaining with the packaging and that
i swatched it and I was
des Daniel so those were all of the
items in it this was not my favorite
month
it really wasn't now is this gonna force
me to try some things different than one
of you trying yes and that is what I
like about this but do I really feel
like oh I'm that was ten dollars well
spent I don't know I think my scare wise
that's pretty cool right I mean that's
an expensive mascara so that's pretty
cool
I mean we got the hairspray we got the
micellar water we got the kind of
sunscreen stuff that I thought was
gimmicky but that I'm like but actually
that could be good so that I mean I'll
put that in my travel djor cuz I
probably actually will use it the you
know the perfumes okay and then this I'm
intrigued but it this shades not even
gonna work for me you know so I don't
know I always every single month think
about canceling because I like Geschke
you don't need five more samples but
then the reviewer in me is like no but
you can try them but then I'm like but
Jessica are you gonna try them you know
what I mean so I don't know this is my
least favorite month easily by far I'm
gonna keep it keep it rolling in honor
of science and an honor of testing out
new things for you all and you know the
reality is for me $10 to be able to try
five new products that's not bad even if
out of the five I only end up really
liking to I don't think that's terrible
but I think if you weren't someone like
me with like this is one of your jobs do
you really need it
I don't know maybe you're trying to grow
your collection maybe you really do
genuinely love trying new products maybe
you just love baby size things you know
you got to decide for yourself I guess
so I know it is the end of March and it
is snowing there are probably about six
inches outside my window what is going
on I live in the Midwest what is going
on it never snows at the end of March
first day of spring came and went and
here we are and then tomorrow it's like
back to 50 degrees I'm like what it just
keeps snowing anyway so this ended up
being way longer than my normal Sephora
videos if you want to see last month's
one which is much better than this I
will link it below otherwise thank you
guys for tag
I will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
