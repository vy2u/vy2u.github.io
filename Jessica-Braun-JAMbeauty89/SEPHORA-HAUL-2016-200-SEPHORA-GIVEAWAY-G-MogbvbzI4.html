a humongous and I mean humongous
probably biggest haul I've ever done
from Sephora like I just feel so
rejuvenated when it comes to beauty in
the fall I don't know what it is there's
lots of new things coming out people are
already releasing like holiday sets now
none of these are holiday sets and
really some of them are brand new and
some of them are not they're just
products that have been on my wish list
forever that I finally wanted to get I'm
doing this video in collaboration with
Ebates which I have worked with them so
many times I love this company if you
have never used Ebates first of all so
many people do and so many people talk
about it so it kind of blows my mind
when people have never heard of it but
basically what it is is it's a website
you can go to to get cash back when you
shop online the way I use it is when I
know that I'm about to place like a big
sapporo order or an amazon order i order
from amazon all the time alta etc i
always go to Ebates search for sephora
then i'll get a percent cash back so if
I'm gonna spend a hundred dollars at
Sephora or like 400 or 604 sometimes
then I know like sometimes it'll be six
percent cashback or eight percent cash
back percent fluctuates from time to
time so you always want to check and see
cuz there are times that the percentage
is even higher so right now they've got
a ton of different deals going on with
their cash backs I'll list it all below
but I'm also doing a giveaway with them
so the giveaway is for two different
$100 Sephora gift cards so basically
it's 200 dollars in Sephora gift cards
that we're giving away if you are
interested you need an Ebates account to
enter so I've got a link below for
Ebates if you don't have an account it's
free to join you already have an Ebates
account or once you've created one
through my link then you'll go to the
giveaway link that's down below and make
sure that when you're entering the
giveaway that you enter the email that
you have associated with your Ebates
account once you've done that you are
entered for the giveaway good luck I'm
so excited
hopefully this video if you do win will
give you some ideas of things you could
buy at Sephora so let's go and get into
it I've I've been holding this bag like
in my hand this entire time and also
guys it's full of just the trash from it
because I've been using it I can tell
you right now I've got my cup of coffee
I've got a lot to show you this is gonna
be a long video so
rapping if you want to go get some
coffee or tea or something to snack on
you might want to also look at this mug
it says boo to you and it's got Mickey
if you've ever been to Disney World
during Halloween they have like their
boo to you parade and my husband is a
Disney World and Disneyland
he's a travel agent anyway so he was
just there for some conferences and
brought me this back and it's like my
favorite thing ever
anyway alright oh my gosh I'm wearing as
much of this as I possibly could on my
face today so I'll kind of walk you
through the first thing I was excited to
pick up from my wishlist was this cover
effects calming primer now they have
quite a few different primers this one
oh as I applied it today
it felt calming and I not that it like
tangled or anything like that it's just
that when I applied it it just felt like
I was applying something that's decent
for my skin on my skin I feel like so
many primers I used like I always feel
like it's like clogging my pores are
just not great for my skin but this is
one of the first ones that the first
time I used it I felt like wow like it
just feels like a good base for my
makeup but it also feels like it's
sinking into my skin in a really good
way so I'm excited to try this some more
but so far loving it and when I got in
my car today after work I looked in the
mirror and I was like my makeup actually
still looks the way it did when I put it
on so that is a testament to the primer
speaking of primers one that I haven't
opened yet is this Smashbox photo finish
primer oil and this is very new to me
but I'm just so intrigued by it because
for me like I would figure as an oil you
might not want this if you have really
oily skin but I get really dry skin like
right now I've got some dry skin going
on so I'm really excited to try this out
so what you do is you push the button on
the top and it kind of sucks it into the
little dropper and then you use it let's
kind of swatch some of this swatch not
really bit doesn't have a noticeable
scent at all it's a very very thin
consistency but it does blend out
quicker than you would think for an oil
like I feel like the oil type serums
that I have they my skin looks really
oily but with this like you can already
there's a little bit of oil to my hand
but it's not like as oily as like in
just straight-up oil does that make
sense so this is basically a really thin
consistency of an oil so I'm a truck
excited to try it I've never tried
anything like this as a primer so let me
know if you've already tried it and how
you feel about it the next thing I
bought and I have not tried yet finally
is the Kat Von D lock-it foundation
everyone's been talking about it i
swatched it in soar and it looked really
good so I'm curious to actually try it
all on my face but I just heard this is
so good for covering every imperfection
you have on your face and you know there
are times
most days I wear just BB creams and
tinted moisturizers because you know
I've got imperfections but they're not
so glaringly obvious that it bothers me
if people see them but you know there
are times where maybe it's an event or a
special gathering that I want to look
really nice and this is the perfect
thing for it so I'm very excited to
finally have it in my collection the
shade of that is I got it in light warm
light 45 warm so today however I'm
wearing another flawless foundation and
this one is new it's the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof long wear liquid
foundation I have heard people rave
about this after one day of using it I
use it with my cover FX primer which you
know I love already this stuff covers
really really well but if you have any
dry skin it does accentuate it now to be
honest with you if I'm looking for full
coverage that doesn't bother me as much
because you know like I sprayed it with
the setting spray that helped because it
kind of melded it more into my skin but
if you have dry skin it this is will not
be your favorite I don't think it's the
worst but it's definitely not the best
foundation for dry skins so however it
does cover imperfections it was really
easy to apply it blend it well I blended
it today with a just flat top brush so I
haven't tried it with like a Beauty
Blender yet so I'll have to get back to
you but and I think the packaging is
cute shows all my finger prints but I
think it's just kind of fun so rad
so I finally bit the bullet and bought
this Laura Mercier loose setting powder
and translucent so many people talk
about this I have the Laura Mercier like
under eye setting powder like the
brightening one and I'll eye
that's not my favorite but I do like it
but I'm excited to just have this
because all of the loose setting powders
like for my whole face that I own are
all drugstore so I have like an elf one
I like I've got a boots one but I've
never owned a high-end one like this so
I'm really intrigued at least I don't
think I have you guys can probably let
me know some of you guys that have been
around forever I don't think that I have
so I'm excited to give this a try I
tried it a little bit today but I didn't
really honestly I was running late so I
was trying to use as much as I could
really quickly but but I liked what I
use I will say if you get I bought the
actual Laura Mercier puff but honestly
you could get any puff but what I like
about this is that the puff is actually
bigger than this so when I open the lid
and I want to get some on the puff I can
just put the puff there and then turn it
over and it'll get on the puff without
getting all over the rim of this lid if
that makes sense and I really like that
because that hasn't been an option for
me with all of the loose powders I've
had so I'm excited to have a really nice
velour puff - I'm so excited and I feel
like because I really don't shop at
Sephora that much I don't go to Sephora
because I know if I do I'll spend a ton
of money and obviously I don't need more
makeup so when I go to Sephora I feel
like I just go crazy and I just can't
stop myself so I bought another Laura
Mercier product this is a highlighter
I'm wearing it today this is their matte
radiance baked powder in the highlight
0/1 shade and it's just this swirled
baked satiny highlight and what I like
about it is it it reminds me of the
ambient lighting powders where there is
definitely a highlighting quality to it
but it's not like in-your-face
unless you get like the strobing ones
which I also really like very finely
milled comfortable to wear it can look
really really natural in like every
lighting and I really like that because
for me in a given day I'm in florescent
lighting and that I'm outside for recess
and then I'm back inside that I'm in my
car and then I'm in my apartment and you
know all those different lighting
situations that we're all in you want
makeup to look good in all those
leggings and I feel like this really
does and it also looks really nice like
on the tip of your nose because it's not
just glittery it's just a
nice sheen to it so I'm loving it so far
and I told you I'm wearing that today
I'm also wearing this splurge II splurge
I've never owned one of these in fact
this I think is the very first Dior
product I've ever bought this is the
Christian Dior blush and it's their Dior
blush in 943 my rose and it's just this
really pretty rose simple plan simple it
looks like it's got some glitter in it
but it doesn't really come across that
way like it's really finely milled so it
just looks satiny but it's just this
perfect rosy tone and I'm wearing it
today like I said I think it's just
really natural not super obvious but it
does still give a nice flush to your
cheeks and I feel like if you're going
to splurge on a high-end item like for
me I don't like buying really expensive
mascaras things like that lip glosses
from time to time I will but for
something like this I feel like blush is
great because it doesn't go bad as
quickly so if you spend a lot of money
on a really luxurious blush at least you
know that you're gonna be able to
probably if you wanted to use it up way
before it goes bad or at least know that
you can have it for a long time and use
it before it goes bad so that is why I
feel like splurging on a blush or
something like that is a little bit more
worth it I got an eyeshadow palette
can you guess what palette I got I'll
give you a second to guess okay now that
you've guessed who guessed right I got
the naked ultimate basics now I have my
ups and downs with the naked palettes I
love I have naked one and two that's it
I keep going back and forth on three and
on the smoky one but I've kind of mixed
things you know and of course I've got
plenty of palettes I don't need them and
then I've had the Naked basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 and
I think now I have the two but I've
gotten rid of the one or vice versa just
because I felt like I love the idea of
it and the shadows were good but I just
felt like I was never reaching for it
well I really liked this when I thought
the packaging is just so cool I mean
they totally know the game when it comes
to packaging but I really like the giant
mirror like for me
because we travel like gosh at least
once a month if not more I'm always
looking for a nice palette that's got a
mirror that will stand on its own and
that's really big so I could like
totally do all of my makeup with this
mirror which I love anyway um
but I just thought these shades were
really really nice it goes from really
dark to really light it's got mostly
matte I think the only shade that's got
a little bit of glimmer to it is this
lightest shade called blow but the rest
of them they're very very matte they're
very pigmented
I think the blend ability is okay I used
this today on my eyes and I felt like
this darker color I was really
struggling to blend out that was the
color lethal which is this darker like
kind of plum I was really struggling to
blend it out so that was the only thing
and I don't know if it was just that
shade everything else seemed fine but I
liked it I liked the color range and
like I said I liked the packaging so
I'll have to let you know as I use it
more how it is I might do at this whole
palette review on this let me know if
you'd be interested in that I got some
lipsticks as well this one the only like
this is the only makeup item that is so
expensive and I keep buying it because
I'm so in love with them this is my
third Marc Jacobs Lamarck lip cream
lipstick that I bought the third shade I
bought a red shade that I wore all over
Paris when I bought it and then I bought
another shade called infamous which is
more like a deeper neutral this one I
bought just for everyday and it's the
shade sonic truth and these are the most
creamy luxurious long lasting
comfortable lipsticks I have ever owned
in my life I have never met a lipstick
that's as good as these ever and I have
tried I swear I feel like everything but
I keep going back to these and I keep
repurchasing different colors because
they're trustworthy I know that they
don't make my lips feel chapped I know
that I can reapply over and over again
and it never looks weird or bunchy or
gross I know that every single shade
I've tried is just as good as the last
so it's not like it's spotty equality
this shade is perfect it's the one I've
been looking for I feel like in this
range this is what I would had hoped
infamous would
infamous is just deeper I still like it
but it's not what I wanted for everyday
this is perfect it's just that every day
very light pink neutral your lips but
better kind of a color the packaging is
just simple it's magnetic which I love
because in my purse the lids not coming
off Oh what's the other lipstick I'm
wearing a lipstick right now this is the
second one of these I bought and I
cannot find my other one this is the
NARS audacious lipstick in Raquel again
really creamy these are
these are just like the Lamarck ones as
i'm swatching it i'm realizing they are
it is just like it so this one I keep
losing it it's just a little bit more
warm tone so I've got like the pink
version in the warm version these don't
really have a smell either that's
noticeable they're just so creamy
pigmented and comfortable long wearing I
mean the honestly I feel like you could
go with lipsticks either way these are
probably two of the best lipsticks for
your money so if you can splurge on one
either one of these if you find a shade
that you really like but it is worth
swatching because I feel like so many
people talk about like shades online and
then when I actually buy them or wear
them I'm like they just don't look good
on me so it's worth going to a store and
actually swatching them because the same
shades don't necessarily look the same
on everyone I know that sounds obvious
but I feel like I keep buying them based
on what someone tells me and I buy them
online and it never looks good on me so
just something to keep in mind I bought
another primer I literally bought three
primers this time around I'm just on a
primer kick I guess this is the Smashbox
photo-finish hydrating primer I'm on the
hunt clearly because I've got dry skin
for that perfect hydrating primer so I
wanted to try this out as well I really
like the regular Smashbox photo finish
primer that kind of feels like silicone
II but I just wanted something a little
bit more hydrating than that so this
looks like a blue gel I mean literally
but it's just oh it's got a very very
strong smell not bad it kind of makes me
think of like makeup remover wipes like
that kind of a smell I don't know like
how to describe it but if
nice but I will say it dries pretty
quickly which is not a bad thing because
you know you want to get your primer on
sink it in and like add on the
foundation just keep rolling so I like
that it dries down quickly but it
doesn't feel hydrating so I'm very
curious to see how this actually works
on the skin I'll have to let you know
curious I'm keeping the packaging for
like everything because I really want to
try it out because I want to be better
about like if I don't like it after like
a week of using it returning it because
I know suppor is really good about that
and I feel like I am really bad about
that and I could save a ton of money if
I just returned what I'm not using duh
oh I got another blush this is the NARS
blush this one's in sin and it's kind of
this like raisin kind of a color and I
just love their formula I just feel like
it it just stays in place that's what I
really like about it it's again one that
I travel with a lot because it's
trustworthy I know that I can apply it
and it's just gonna stay there and I
know it's good quality
this one's just much deeper and I
thought for fall this is so beautiful
and again of course you don't apply it
that heavily but I'm excited I haven't
gotten to actually wear it for an entire
day yet but I'm really excited to cuz
it's just so different I have nothing
like this in my collection let's keep
rolling alright I bought a NARS
eyes shadow duo I'm kind of torn I'm
wearing it on my lids today this is the
eyeshadow duo in is sold this was on my
wish list from years ago years ago like
before I had a channel so many people
loved it and I really do like it but I
kind of like I was on that shoppers hi
where I was like yes yes yes but like as
I use it today it's really really nice
but I was like do I really need a duo
with two colors that I have in like 15
other palettes so I'm I'm kind of torn I
don't know but it has this really pretty
gold and then this really pretty bronze
and they are gorgeous oh my gosh they're
I feel like I have to keep it
look how unbelievably pigmented those
are just creamy to the max stayed on all
day on my lids and actually I didn't
wear this
I look to work today I just wore this I
put the gold all over the lid and then I
put the bronze just kind of into the
crease blended it all together and then
just like a little bit of eyeliner that
was it so I felt like it was a really
easy everyday look and so that would be
one reason I would want to keep it
because I know again if I'm in a hurry I
can just grab this throw it on and look
put together without having to do really
like any work at all so I like that and
the quality is superb but I just don't
know if I need it you know anyone get me
on that shoppers I like where you just
get to that point you're like yes I'm
just gonna buy it and then you're like
why did I buy this like buyer's remorse
all right for more things two of them I
have to thank my friend Carol Lago who I
met when I was in New York because she
was the one that got me onto this train
sonner how I feel like you know my nails
just like never grow long and like even
when they are like okay the nail
polishes always chips it always looks
crazy she recommended these she and she
showed me her nails and they looked
amazing with this on so she had I didn't
buy an actual color yet because I really
didn't see when I loved but like she was
saying you really can use any nail
polish with it she has a channel by the
way I'll link her below she is lovely
and her tutorials are amazing and she
deserves so many more subscribers so go
show her some love tell her I sent you
I'll link her channel below she's
absolutely lovely and so talented anyway
so this is the formula X prime XL base
coat and the shine XL topcoat she said
it dries really quickly obviously I have
not used them yet kind of hoping tonight
like I'm gonna edit this video I'm
hoping I can like play with my nails and
see how it lasts but so excited I feel
like it's so hit or miss with things
like this so to have someone actually
recommend it that is used it is huge to
me so very excited to give those a try
last two things I got this Kat Von D
locket concealer cream I almost I had
this and the locket concealer in my hand
but I know that the lock of concealer is
just a little bit thicker and I've got
plenty of really thick opaque under-eye
concealers and since I don't use those
every day and I'm way more likely to use
a
but creamier of a formula I ended up
going for this one I think this one's
new so that I got an l7 warm I'm wearing
it today it's pretty awesome the doe
foot is like a little bit more wide than
I'm used to what I liked it and it's
even softer which I like because it's
under your eyes so you kind of want that
of course I mean there's a swatch it
doesn't really do anything for concealer
I don't think but it blended really
really well if you've got fine lines
like I do it's going to sink into them I
have to be honest with you I have never
found a concealer that doesn't but I
feel like you know for me I'm like this
close to myself putting on my makeup so
I can see every fine line and I feel
like I get so in my head like Oh ever
even see it but the reality is no one's
that close to you well they might be but
you know what I mean
so knowing that most people are like at
least this far from you can you guys see
my fine lines from there well don't tell
me if you can but like I feel like we
get so in our head about it and it's not
that big of a deal you know everyone's
come out throughout the day I'll take
like my ELF
daily moisturizing stick or something
like that and just kind of press it into
that region just to kind of blend it
together but anyway
this was a really nice concealer I was
very impressed again I've only used it
like once so I need to try it some more
and let you know last thing that I
bought is this YSL Touche clot radiant
touch concealer I guess you call it a
concealer Oh highlighter and concealer I
have the YSL and I actually just
decluttered it it's there it's the same
thing it's a two o'clock but it's a like
a color corrector and it was in like the
reddish orange and I never ever used it
and I felt like it didn't do anything
for my skin so I passed it on to someone
that actually wouldn't use it but this I
haven't tried yet I'm so excited you
know this is a cult classic favorite I
just watch it in store I got it in the
shade number two just cuz I felt like
number one was just a little bit too
light let me get it going here no I
always feel like I'm wasting it's just a
really light shade right there it's
probably just like cancelled out really
creamy
Wow easy to blend oh my gosh it blended
perfectly but this is awesome you can
conceal with it but you can also get
down the bridge of your nose where you
know right around your nose anywhere you
want to brighten and conceal I'm so
excited to finally actually try this I
would like to you guys know I love doing
dupes on my channel and I recently have
a dupes video up if you haven't seen it

dupes that I don't think anyone had ever
