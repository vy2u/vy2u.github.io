goodies to share hey guys it's Jessica
and today I have a Sephora haul oh just
in time for the vib sale because I want
to show you guys some of the things that
I had been interested in and wanted to
buy maybe it'll inspire you maybe it's
something that you're thinking about
buying but I'm also uploading a video of
my top support recommendations if that
video is up I will like it below if it
is not stay tuned because I have a lot
of things I'd recommend but these are
all new products to me totally regular
hauls style let's go and get into it so
I'm doing this video in collaboration
with Ebates I work with Ebates all the
time because I use Ebates everytime I
shop online most of you guys already use
it because you've been following me for
a while it's free I have a referral link
in the description box if you'd like to
join Ebates
basically all it is is you go to the
shop you can download their little tool
bar and so anytime you go to say Sephora
or Ulta or Macy's whatever it will pop
up and say hey get four percent cashback
and then you click the green button and
all of a sudden whatever you end up
buying on that shopping trip online you
get cash back in your Ebates account
they pay you four times a year and I
have made a lot of money back that way
because I am shopping online all the
time that's I mean to be honest I very
rarely actually go to Sephora or Ulta
anymore I just buy it online so for me
it's a great way if I'm already going to
spend the money why not make five
dollars back or ten dollars back and I
really didn't have to do any work for it
now obviously the vib sale is going on
right now as we're speaking unless
you're watching it like way later I'll
have all the info on the Sephora vib
sale down below but obviously you're
getting a percent off of your entire
purchase which is a big deal it's very
rare it happens what twice a year
they're having a promotion right now
we're a bunch of stores online our
double cashback their normal percentage
so like Nike is one of them Athleta
Barneys New York Kohl's misfit New
Balance Neiman Marcus so those are
double their normal but they always have
cash back on Sephora Ulta Mac it
cosmetics Macy's there's so much if you
have tried it out and you want to share
about your experience please do in the
comments I know that sometimes it can be
helpful to hear from multiple people
about your experience but like I said
it's free to use so definitely check it
out
alright so
to the hall Oh oh my gosh okay
so these are some products that I have
been dying to try for so long and so I'm
so excited to finally have my grubby
little hands on them okay the first
thing I actually have not tried yet this
is the Sephora cake and baked liquid and
powder makeup sponge I haven't even
opened this but this is a purple sponge
it is shaped like it's shaped like those
classic white foundation wedges you know
you can buy but it is a little bit
bigger than that so I'm sure it'll get
bigger when I wet it but it feels very
similar to the Beauty Blender I have to
admit like when you first get a Beauty
Blender and open it's a has that same
density so I'm curious to try it I like
that it's got this shape because you
could get you know maybe some powder and
then just and wipe it on if you really
are trying to bake you can really get
some straight lines with it which I'm
sure is why it's called cake and bake
but it says how to use wet cake and bake
with water until saturated squeeze out
the excess pick up liquid or powder
makeup products with the bottom or flat
edge and apply to conceal and/or bake
and this is how to clean use your
favorite soap rinse under cold water
until clean squeeze excess water lay
flat to dry so I'm excited to go to try
just because I haven't really heard
anyone talk about it and who knows next
product I was so excited to pick up was
the Tarte fake awake eyeliner this is
like a light peach colored eyeliner and
it's just meant to make your all go and
put it on now it's meant to make your
waterline look brighter right on your
lower lash line so if you are naturally
red there you'll notice and I didn't
notice this until someone else pointed
it out but like when you wake up in the
morning you're really tired if you look
at your waterline it typically is a
little bit pink or red and so this is
something that you know if you are tired
this really does make you look just a
little bit more awake but it doesn't
look ridiculous like I feel like the
white ones that I've used a long time
ago made me look so silly and so I was
excited to try this because I wanted to
compare it to my pixie one their eye
bright liner and their extra
right liner so I'm excited to try those
maybe side-by-side and do like a dual
type video let me know if you'd be
interested because the pixie one is only
actually only a couple dollars cheaper
than this so maybe it's not even worth
messing with next thing I picked up was
this NARS concealer in oh it's their
soft matte complete concealer I had
heard great things about this it's a
newer product and of course the
packaging is really nice to take pop
concealer I know some people don't like
that because you're dipping your finger
it is what it is
somebody sent me a snap the other day of
like a picture frame or like a canvas
that just said it is what it is
and I really had not realized how much I
started to say that but I say it all the
time but it just covers so much like
there's so many things in life that I'm
like well you can't change it it is what
it is anyway
um it is a very creamy concealer
especially for one in a pot I was
shocked at how creamy it is very great
coverage I wouldn't call like the full
list of coverage but I would still call
it pretty medium to full um I have
applied with my finger and blended it
that way I've applied it with my finger
and then blended it with a Beauty
Blender that worked pretty well I did
that today and I don't think I've tried
it with a brush yet so I'll have to try
it with the brushes well if you have a
favorite way to blend this in let me
know but I just like that it's small
portable but it I like that it doesn't
look luminizing because I feel like when
I'm really tired and I've got like
little bags under my eye when I've got a
concealer that's very dewy even when I
said it I feel like it just looks a
little off it makes me look worse than I
would without it and so I feel like this
is a really nice almost Deni matte kind
of a finish I think that's perfect for
the under eyes so I was really impressed
with this I bought an eyeshadow palette
this is the new one from NARS it's their
NARS loaded eyeshadow palette I actually
haven't even taken this off isn't that
the best now I'm going to really get it
dirty really cool packaging um but it's
got 12 shadows in here definitely a
neutral palette but what I loved about
it is it
a dark black a dark brown it has a bunch
of shimmers and a good amount of mass so
it had a nice warm kind of medium brown
it's got a cooler medium brown it just
kind of got everything the only thing no
I was going to say it's missing it
really is not missing anything again
that's my cup of tea that's my opinion
because that's what I like putting all
my eyes I use this for my I love today
wasn't a crazy complicated eye look but
I use the warmer colors here in the
crease I use the darker brown on my
lower lashline and on my outer corner I
use like the this light nude shade on my
brow bone etc oh and then all over my
lid is this kind of more shimmery
orangie color do I think these are the
same caliber as like their little duo's
that NARS has oh my gosh the quality of
those is out of this freaking world do I
think this is the same quality I feel
like it's close but I don't think it's
as good but it's still really good so
you're totally drawn to these colors and
you've maybe got a gift card you wanted
to take advantage of the sale whatever I
really do like it alright I splurged
this is the Yves Saint Laurent Touche
Claud blur primer years ago okay like
two years ago from Influenster I got
like a small trial of this and I tried
it want some like mm and pass it on well
I sense heard like a million things
about it that no actually it's really
nice but of course it's really really
expensive like why did I get rid of that
not try so I thought you know what I'm
just gonna do it so I bought it and it
has these like gold flecks in it and it
has a pump thank goodness I was scared
it'd be like my NYX let me just show you
I have this NYX honeydew me up and it
has this paddle and I don't think I like
this product I'm still trying it out but
it's really sticky and it has this
paddle to apply and I hate that so I was
very relieved when I took the lid off
and it had a pom-poms like thank
goodness but it's not as you know comes
out clear you can still see the little
gold flakes but it really is way more
blurry
and I thought I thought I'd be maybe
sticky or maybe it would be kind of
illuminating but not in a way I want it
to be no it totally look like fills in
lines and pores
it's crazy soft crazy soft so if you're
looking for something and you're wanting
to splurge my goodness this is so
beautiful again I want to try this out
some more before I like say yes you need
it or no you don't but I do like it so
far
now this foundation is amazing and
you've heard good things about it
already and there's a reason this is the
Lancome 10t doll
Ultra wear foundation this is way too
light for me I am I have decided I am
horrible at picking out my foundation
shade on line
I look up swatches on Google I do all of
the things we all know to do I'll look
on foundation matrice matrices and I
swear I never get it right somehow but
this is way too light but I didn't want
it to be way too dark so I went like way
the other way and it's just a little bit
you can kind of see I actually mixed it
with a darker foundation my ELF one I
love and it's still I feel like doesn't
perf well it's not too bad it's still
I've got it's a little bit too light but
this foundation I like it best with a
Beauty Blender it is crazy high coverage
it it's just beautiful like I feel like
it's so much more flawless than any of
the other foundations I have and the
packaging is really really nice has this
beautiful gold rose not that that
matters but we all know that sometimes
packaging sucks us in um also someone
requested that I do a video about like
the packaging what did they call it
apparently other people have done these
videos I just have never seen them but
it's like you know things that you
bought sheerly for the packaging and
then it ended up being terrible I
thought that would be fun so let me know
if you like to see that anyway so it's
high-coverage
comfortable to wear I have dry skin and
it still works for my dry skin I can't
see my dry patches I know it's like the
craziest thing so I need to get my
correct shade so I might actually just
straight up return this like go to the
store return it and get my correct shade
instead of trying to guess again
I'm just so lazy
I'm totally rather bright online but I
am going to because I ended up loving
this um the last two things I have are
these little samples I think they were
100 point perks but this is the tarte
brighterdayz highlighting moisturizer I
thought what I haven't even open this
but I'm so intrigued I'm like yes I will
spend a hundred points on that cuz it's
actually a decent size oops
so it's a white moisturizer but it does
have like a sheen to it kind of like a
gold reflex it just smells I mean it
doesn't really have a smell it
definitely has a glow to it it reminds
me in a way of this backlight priming
filter from Becca I mean really I think
it might not be as um no it really is
very similar and I think the packaging
this is really cute of course that's a
small size so I'm sure the bigger one is
probably similar but definitely will try
that out probably end up using that up
and I also got the dr. brandt Luminizer
primer from their pores no more line and
I have not tried this yet either
let's see what is this one oh my arm so
this one is a little bit more of a nude
color to it oh this one is um has a
little bit of a smell no or maybe that's
just my makeup white but I might like
that one even better it's not quite as
luminizing as the other one and it's a
little bit more of a warm tone it just
looks really pretty like it made my skin
look pretty you know what I mean so Wow
so those were pretty awesome point perks
the time that I got it so those were all
of my things that I picked up this time
around I'm probably going to buy more
for the vib sale let me know what you
think I should buy and like I said if my
recommendations video is up I will link
that below and otherwise I hope you
enjoyed it hopefully you'll subscribe
and definitely tricky baits out because
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
