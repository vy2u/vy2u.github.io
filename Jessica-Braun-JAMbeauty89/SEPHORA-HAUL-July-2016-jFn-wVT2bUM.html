halt and this looking into my little bag
I kind of compiled everything into this
Sephora bag but some of it is not from
Sephora but it is all high-end stuff
this might be a long video so you might
want to get like some tea some coffee
some popcorn whatever I always recommend
popcorn what is because it's like my
favorite snack of all time so I guess
for me I'm like yeah popcorn of course I
don't want you guys to get it twisted I
love makeup in general and sometimes
when I do you know like a couple
high-end things in a row or if I talk
about more high-end than drugstore for a
you know a couple videos a lot of you
guys say oh my gosh like I can't watch
your channel anymore you don't do any
drugstore but I promise you drugstore is
still like my rock so I'm never gonna
just stray away from it completely I
will always do drugstore videos it's
just that right now I'm lucky enough to
get a lot of things sent to me from
companies and I want to share them with
you it's things that either I think are
amazing or maybe they're really bad and
I want to share them with you so you
don't waste your money but it doesn't
mean that I'm ever just walking away
from drugs are completely that will
never happen
so I wanted to kind of clear the air ID
so just know that but this is a high end
video this is some Sephora stuff some
stuff you can buy at Alta and some other
things that might have been sent to me
and I will let you know which is which
which ones I bought etc let's go ahead
and get into it
so most of the stuff I bought while I
was in Walt Disney World which we go all
the time my husband's at Disney World
travel agent and so we just recently got
back like when I'm filming this
yesterday but I they have a Sephora at
Disney springs which used to be called
Downtown Disney which I always used to
call Downton Disney hashtag Downton
Abbey problems also I wish that show
hadn't ended anyway I'm gonna start with
the thing I'm the most excited about
this is the Tarte tartlet in bloom
palette and I realized that some of my
favorite eyeshadow formulas are tart and
Too Faced I love the Too Faced action I
mean also Urban Decay like I could never
pick but I really like tart eyeshadows
so this one I was just I was torn
between this and the Naked 3 and if you
follow me on Instagram and snapchat on
Instagram I uploaded this picture that
I'm showing you right now and I said you
know find out if I bought this and the
Naked 3 or just this one and then
humph my snapchat while I was shopping
when I thought I was buying two naked
three I had it my hand i snapchatted
like oh and buy a new makeup and you
could see the naked 3 in it and then I
saw this palette and so I didn't
snapchat about it but I ended up buying
this one and putting the naked 3 back
and so I was just giggling cuz a lot of
you guys on Instagram were like you
bought both I watched you on snapchat
hashtag snapchat fam and I'm like oh my
gosh I feel so bad but I didn't mean to
let lead you astray I didn't think about
it but I just thought that was kind of
funny I only bought this one not the
naked 3 although that one's still on my
mind anyway this one is gorgeous look at
the colors in it it's got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 matte shadows and 3 shimmery ones I
think that's the perfect ratio I could
maybe one more shimmer but sometimes I
feel and by sometimes I mean like all
the time I feel like palettes are all
shimmer shadows and like too matte ones
and I feel like for me for everyday
especially being a teacher as well like
I don't necessarily want shimmer all the
way up to my brow bone you know so it's
really nice to have so much option so
for me this made so much sense not only
are the shadows gorgeous they're
gorgeously pigmented it's ridiculous but
the packaging is beautiful it feels so
well made it's kind of gold on the back
and then it's this beautiful front oh my
gosh I don't have the original tartlet
palette but this was the one out of the
two I really wanted the in bloom I just
thought it's way more up my alley but it
is worth the money I love it so much I
cannot stop using it now if you're
wondering what I'm wearing on my eyes
today I went a little darker than usual
although I never know if it comes across
on camera because most of you guys like
you wear the same thing every day and
I'm like I never do I literally always
change up with but it's always pretty
similar so it just doesn't come across
on camera but this is the Too Faced told
you I love their shadows the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette which I
thought I would hate and I ended up
loving but looking at I was like oh I'll
hate that I love it it's ridiculous okay
when I'm wearing on my cheeks which
again I don't know how well it comes
across on camera but this is the
hourglass ambient lighting blush and
mood exposure I have been wanting this
forever it's just this beautiful kind of
mauve color blush it's so
simple it's not really shimmery it has a
little bit of a glow to it which is very
much in tune with what the ambient
lighting powders in general are all
about so it fits right in and it has
that supposedly mixed in with it but I
just can't stop using it it might be I'm
being honest with you guys this might be
the best blush I've ever owned
the day I bought it and I put it on I
looked at myself in the mirror and I was
like this is exactly right for me it's
exactly where for my skintone my skin
type my hair color
everything just fit right in and it's
not too shimmery but it's not too matte
it's not too pigmented but it's not too
not pigmented I just thought oh my gosh
like this is the blush I'm always
looking for but I never find I always
find stuff that's close this is amazing
you guys I don't know about the other
colors I really honestly as i swatched
them was it really that excited about
any of the other ones but this one I was
like so if you feel like you've tried a
million blushes and you've spent a lot
of money on blush and you feel like why
can't I find the right one these might
be worth looking into for you because it
just is it's the Goldilocks effect you
know what I mean the next thing I bought
this is the cult classic and some of you
guys are gonna be like seriously Jessica
you didn't already own that and you're a
beauty blogger and I'll be like yeah I
didn't marry on it this is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in opal how I
don't already own that I still don't
know and I'll be honest I was so torn
between this and champagne pop and also
Jaclyn Hills palette but I looked at the
palette I was like I'm not gonna use a
lot of this I don't use face palettes
very often to be honest I do from time
to time so I thought I probably
shouldn't spend my money there so I was
torn between this and champagne pop and
I was just like you know what this is
just so classic it's just ridiculous I
mean you'll see it's just it - will be
an eyeshadow I know a lot of people use
it as an eyeshadow but it's it's just
there's something about it that it's
like totally BAM in your face but in the
right lighting it's also not that
in-your-face because it blends so
beautifully where it just catches the
light where it doesn't just look like a
strip of glitter it's just catching the
light correctly which is the whole idea
of highlighting low lighting contouring
is the light I mean that's literally
what it's all based on so for me I was
like I've got to own this I have to try
it so I've had it Becca highlighter
before but it was like a goal
one and it was like yellow I think I
bought it on HauteLook so it was like
chump change like it was so cheap on
HauteLook which I loved but it just
wasn't right for my skin tone it would
look a lot better on someone with maybe
a more olive skin tone so I've used this
the last few days of my trip and
actually I used it today although I'm
not I didn't put a lot on but I loved it
so much the next thing I bought was a
bike Beauty lipstick in fig and I
actually had a duo of this with some
other shade I think it was like a
birthday gift or some kind of something
a lot of us here on YouTube and a lot of
you guys have it cuz it was some kind of
Sephora like free gift but I really like
the shade fig oh god my nose oh my gosh
I did it again stop bringing it that
close here I might as well be shoving it
these are cool because they're food
grade ingredients so I here I mean I
kind of think it's fight okay this is
Tyler's like keyboard piano over here by
the way and I literally just took the
lipstick and like hit the piano with it
what is wrong with me and this lipstick
I better like close it while I can
it's closed guys we're safe let me wipe
it off anyway but these are food grade
ingredients and what I was gonna say
before I so rudely ruined my lipstick
was that I feel like I trust so much of
what other people say that I never like
research it people like yeah it's made
from food grade quality and I'm like
cool I've never looked it up I have no
idea
true I figure it is but I just was
thinking about that when I bought this I
was like you know I trust so much I so
blindly trust people I should probably
be a little more like divisive is that
the right word decisive no it's still
not right deduce if no anyway but the
color is just so pretty it's one of
those perfect kind of deeper but not
really that deep colors it's kind of
like what I'm wearing on my lips right
now which is a Smashbox always on lip
color in babe babe alert that's what it
is I'm trying it out right now
but I really like this it's just so this
is just a little bit cooler it's really
moisturizing it's not matte but it's not
like shimmery by any means it's just
kind of healthy which I'm really getting
into way more than the matte lips right
now even though
I'm wearing a matte lip color right now
I really like it so now moving on to
things from Ulta first thing I you in my
travel makeup video that I was ordering
a full size and I did from Ulta calm
this is the cosmetics CC cream in light
I told you I finally found the right
shade I was posting on my Instagram
about it as well this stuff really is
amazing and I've heard people talk about
it forever and it kind of drove me nuts
because I tried it once and didn't like
it I know the shade I had was way too
dark that was part of it but as I used
to more and more and I've gotten more
into BB creams this is like in-between a
BB cream and a foundation to be honest
it covers like a foundation it has SPF
of 50 which I loved while I was in
Florida because I didn't have to put
another sunscreen on I could use this
and know that my face was covered and
honestly you guys that lasted all day I
had no burning whatsoever for two weeks
in Florida
whereas I got a little bit of color even
though I had SPF on my skin and I had to
reapply that throughout the day everyday
this I never had to reapply and I never
burned or had any color which was
awesome so I love this stuff so much
I just feel chatty today like I just
feel like chatting with you guys cuz
it's been so long since I've actually
filmed all the other videos I did before
filming today were from before my trip
so it's like two and a half weeks ago I
also purchased this Stila smudge pot
okay I don't know what to say about this
all the reviews for this are pretty darn
good and that's why I got it it's
supposed to be a waterproof gel eyeliner
and I got it in black I just needed a
new gel eyeliner I'm almost out of the
mica beauty one that I love but it's
black but it's just a really thin very
creamy almost too creamy consistency
that for me I'm used to stuff a little
bit thicker I guess or maybe this is too
thick I see I don't know how to describe
this I just don't love it I don't think
I think I'll use it up because I mean
it's doing what I needed to do to
blacken the line there and kind of
define it more but it's not it's just
not my favorite so for me I think I'll
use it up but I don't think I'm gonna
buy it again so I was like some people
love this though because of the formula
so I think it just depends on what
you're used to I feel like I'm a little
more used to something just a little bit
thicker
that applies a little more slowly that
way I have a little more control because
I'm not a makeup artist so for me I'm
like I need all the time I can get this
just glides on so smoothly which is
fantastic but for me I'm like uh I kind
of want a thicker line that's even
blacker and even sorry I'm like trying
to sit indian-style even when I would
apply like two layers of this I felt
like it was pretty black but not
perfectly covering like shimmery shadows
I might have on my lid does that make
sense if anyone can explain it better
than I can down below please do because
I feel like I can't describe that very
well next thing I bought I'm wearing on
my brows this is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow definer and I got it in the
shade medium brown I used to have this
is like a triangular tip before I go any
deeper it reminds me of the hourglass
arch shaping pencil that I really really
like but I just wanted to try something
different and this the shade is perfect
I use it on my brows today and I just
feel like it does a great job it doesn't
budge this bully is really really good
it's pretty big I almost wish it were
like thinner if does that make sense
like not as thick just a little bit
thinner like the original Anasazi brow
wiz ones are I end up like reaching for
that and just using this fully because I
love it so much
but it's amazing I just like this
application with the bigger keep
grabbing the wrong side with the bigger
actual pencil more than the brow is but
I will say I use the brow wiz to just
fill in little bits especially over here
today so there's kind of pros and cons
of both with this you can't be as
particular but the other one just takes
longer because it's really small so kind
of just depends but honestly I I assume
it's the same formula and both the shade
is exactly the same so it just really
depends on your personal preference
another Stila item my favorite my
probably most repurchase product of all
time it's the seal assailed a waterproof
eyeliner now I keep saying and I do once
I once I'm done with this I am going to
buy the Kat Von D tattoo liner because a
lot of you guys recommend that and you
even say it's even better than this so I
really want to try that but I keep
buying this because I love it
they redid the pack
where it's a little bit more golden I
think I mentioned that one of my
previous videos which I didn't gets just
a little bit prettier but it's not that
different but the felt-tip is amazing it
goes to a really good point it's just
totally waterproof it's what I use to do
my wing every single day of my life it
stays in place we swam while we were at
Disney of course and the mascara I was
wearing was not waterproof so that ran
but nothing else did isn't that cool I
was like wow so that was pretty neat
that stuff is amazing let me know if
you'd be interested in like a waterproof
makeup test I know a lot of people are
doing those on YouTube and I have
enjoyed watching them so if you'd be
interested in me doing one let me know
because I kind of have a desire to but I
don't want to do it if none of yours
you're gonna watch it so let me know
another thing the Anastasio clear brow
gel another repurchased item like a mill
I probably bought like six of these it's
just the clear brow gel it really holds
it like hairspray I love it these last
two items I did not purchase they were
sent to me one of them was sent to me
from Too Faced it was the entire Born
This Way concealer collection right now
I'm using the shade fair although I also
use light I'm even use very fair I mean
they're pretty slight the differences
between them so you can't really go
wrong even if you're ordering online if
you've got an idea of what you might be
it'll probably be fine
I really haven't used this enough to
know how I feel I didn't end up bring it
on my trip with me but it just got a doe
foot applicator you know it's pretty
creamy it blends pretty well it does
settle into fine lines but to be quite
candid I haven't really found a
concealer that doesn't at all especially
if you apply a lot so if you can avoid
the area where you might have fine lines
like I've got some right there that's
better
but sometimes it's hard to avoid
especially when you're in a rush or you
just have dark circles and you want that
covered so you kind of have to pick your
battles with that but I want to try this
a little bit more let me know if you'd
be interested in like a full-on review
of that I've also thought about doing
like reviews on Instagram and snapchat
because for products like this I don't
always like dedicating an entire video
to it here on YouTube but if you'd be
interested in just a short like 60
second review of it after I tried it for
a while on my social let me know this
was also sent to me from Wyatt well it
was from Influenster so if you have
signed up for influencer you sometimes
get free products that just try
in review not just on YouTube but like
literally on websites review it so this
was the YSL mascara in its their vinyl
Couture mascara and it's in the shade
number five I'm the trouble and they're
colored mascaras I have not tried this
yet I don't I mean actually I'm thinking
now probably would have looked really
awesome with my like darker blue shadow
I'm wearing today it has that classic
YSL smell even their mascaras smell like
that I don't know how to describe but if
you've ever smelled any way I sell like
product at all especially their lip
product it smells like that it looks
very blue I'm just gonna put a little
bit on my just on my skin I mean it is
blue I haven't tried it yet so if you've
tried it let me know I'm just not big on
color mascaras but to be honest I
haven't tried a lot you guys want me to
show you some of the PR stuff I got I
will show you a sneak peek of some of it
but some of them I'm gonna do a whole
video on hold on let me grab it alright
I have a few things to show you guys let
me put this back in so it can look
pretty so the first thing was sent to me
from Smashbox and it is my gosh oh it is
I don't know if it's their entire line
or not but it's they're always on liquid
lipsticks so I'm wearing one today I
told you earlier and babe alert it's
just like the okay it's in similar
packaging I'll show you the packaging to
like the Maybelline vivid matte liquid
things like the same kind of packaging
as that but the formula is not like that
the formulas like the Stila liquid
lipsticks which i really like this is
what I'm wearing today they're really
pretty I mean they're gorgeous they're
stupid pigmented but if they smell like
vanilla they smell just like the seal
wants to be honest with you um I like it
so far it's the same thing as the other
ones where I just feel like it's just a
class of liquid lipstick originally now
that I'm looking at I've had it on for
about an hour it's doing pretty well
it's not even like wow I have to admit
usually by this point I feel like it's
kind of like looking crazy but in
actually so much
good so I'll probably review those like
with the lip swatch video I haven't done
a lip swatch video in a little bit so
I'll probably do that but again let me
know if you're super interested in that
I'll do it sooner rather than later the
next thing was ridiculous and when I
opened it in the mail Tyler and I were
both like oh my gosh like I teared up
this is like and it made me instantly
think about when I was first starting
YouTube like a couple years ago well
almost no about was it three years ago
when I was living with my parents still
and I was like filming on my bedroom
floor and like I remember being so
excited when a company would contact me
and say hey you know we'll send you a
lip gloss and I was like oh my gosh and
it was just so exciting and now they're
sending me like too much stuff and it is
the most amazing thing ever you guys it
doesn't lose its like luster it is still
so exciting like my heart still pounds
so this is from bareMinerals and it's
their Jen nude yours aren't ready for
this let me make sure it's like in frame
oh my gosh wait oh let me hold on
there's like a little booklet okay are
you ready
is that not ridiculous I was just like
oh my gosh
so it has there let me see if I can kind
of okay this is there Jen nude matte
liquid lip colors and they're like truly
all nudes but I'm like you know what
that's literally what I wear these are
their Jen nude radiant lipsticks and I
did swatch one of them and they're very
kind of like the bite Beauty lipsticks
where they're just comfortable not matte
they're just comfortable everyday
lipsticks where there's a little bit of
moisture to them I love that these are
their Jen nude buttercream lip glosses
and then these over here they're Jen
nude under over lip liners and there's
five of those I cannot wait to crack
into this even more I will definitely do
a video I figure I should just do a lips
with lip swatch video of all of them
that's gonna take a while but what do
you I mean I feel like I have to to do
all of this beauty justice oh my gosh so
I also have a Mac haul but I'm going to
do that
videos so if it's already up I'll link
it below otherwise you stay tuned but
that is everything you want to show you
there are a couple other things I've
gotten from companies but they're all
strewn throughout or they're like in my
bathroom I'm using them whatever but if
they're really really good or they're
really really bad you will definitely
hear about them in future videos so
don't you worry
doesn't that I hope you enjoyed this
ridiculously long haul if you'd like to
see more of my hauls I will link my
playlist of all the three years worth of
hauls that I've done if you just are in
one of those moods like I get in those
moods with declutter videos and
everyone's wealth makeup collection
videos where I just get in the mood and
I'm like I just want to watch only that
so my entire like watch later playlist
is all declutter video it's like I think
that's where I'm at right now um I'm
kind of fueling up for a new declutter
series I haven't done one in a while
because honestly I don't like holding on
to it and waiting for a video so for me
I'm like if I'm done I just get rid of
it but I'm trying to like this sounds
really weird but like hold on to some
stuff that I know I want to get rid of
to show you guys in a video because I
know a lot of you guys are like that's
why I subscribe to you I want more
declutter and I love decluttering so I'm
gonna hold on to them for the sake of
you guys and I will soon soon soon start
a declutter series I'm excited to are
you guys excited I'm so excited so other
than that I hope that you guys will
catch more of my videos I hope that
