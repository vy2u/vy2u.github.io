a Sephora haul update for you so this is
actually two different Sephora hauls I'd
put up maybe a month or two ago I did a
vib sale haul and then I did one shortly
after that that was just about as big of
a haul because I love makeup uh
so I've tried a lot of this some of it I
am returning turning some of it I have
returned and a lot of it I loved so
let's go and get into it I love doing
these kinds of videos because I feel
like they are really the only way you
know hauls are fun to watch for me like
I like hauls but the only way to really
know like for those for hauls to even be
beneficial is to do a haul update video
where you know I kind of have that
follow through and I tell you like okay
here's what I've actually tried and
here's how I feel about it because you
know in a hole I can swatch it or say oh
I've used it once but you know other
than that there's not a lot of benefit
to so um the only thing is I'm not gonna
mention today because there were so many
products are products that I already
tried so in those halls you would have
seen like oh there are some liners I
bought that I've been trying for years
and I love them so I was just
repurchasing so if it was something I
repurchase I'm not gonna mention so I
tried to grab everything I could find I
will link both of those Sephora hauls
down below if you have not seen them and
of course off links to everything I
mentioned down below as well alrighty so
should we start with good stuff or bad
so I don't know let's talk about the
palettes first because I knew a lot of
you guys were like how do you feel about
those because I bought some freaking
expensive palettes um so the first one I
bought was from Hoonah Beauty and it's
the desert dusk palette I've had this
for two months now I've probably only
used it like five times if even that I
think that I was so caught up in the
hype of it but in reality the colors and
this are not colors that I personally
wear all the time I think that the mats
are absolutely gorgeous the shimmers are
a little bit more tricky to work with
but I still think they're really pretty
but you definitely need a good primer
underneath you you know with some of
them that are more glittery you need
like a glitter primer and you need to
spray your brush with like a setting
spray your mac fix+ something like that
just to get them to stay on your eye and
not have tons of fallout and I think
for the price point of this I don't
wanna have to deal with that and I know
that makes me sound maybe either lazy or
snobby I don't know but I feel like
their palates out there they're the same
price or way cheaper that you don't have
to be so fussy with and I'm like I get
that it's the formula and it's not
necessarily a bad thing but for me I'm
like why should I have to work that hard
if I don't want to work that hard I
don't you know what I mean why would I
spend you know 60 something $70 on a
palette and so I think for that reason
I'm like I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna
keep playing with it especially you know
I really like some of these shimmers
here like cashmere and angelic I've worn
a decent amount they were just really
really pretty but you can even see
there's just like lots and lots of
powder kick up but it's a glittery
powder and that's what stinks because
when that fallout gets there it's harder
to get up so I think it's a good palette
I just don't think it's the best palette
for me if that makes sense so if you're
similar to me if these look like colors
you totally reach for then you'd
probably really like it but I should
have known myself better and known that
I wouldn't necessarily be up my alley
it's still a good power though I hope
that made sense the other palette that I
got is from Natasha de Nonna now I will
say this I've used this a lot more and I
think it's because the shades in here
are just more up my alley
this was way more expensive mattes
gorgeous shimmers gorgeous however the
shimmers are very similar
I'd like the shimmers in this better
than the hooded Beauty ones but again
it's the same thing where there is a lot
of like powdery kick up and you have to
be aware of that and use a good primer
and sometimes you need to spray your
brush like there's this really glittery
shade down here that it's gonna be
fallout City unless you like follow like
you take those precautions but I really
really like it I love that there's a lot
of good transition shades in here that's
really big for me and they're really
really pigmented matte colors they blend
like a dream so you know if you're
thinking about splurging obviously this
is way more than this but it really is
way better now is this the best palette
or my favorite palette I've ever tried
no it's not and for that reason I don't
know that I'll be buying any more
Natasha's Inanna palettes I will use
this one I
like it but because it's not like my
favorite favorite I feel like like I
want it to be my favorite favorite for
the freaking amount that I paid so
that's just kind of my two cents like I
said neither one of them are bad but
neither one of them were so good that I
was like oh my gosh everyone should go
run out and get this no I think there
are better ones out there now one that I
felt hold on let me wet these swatches
off there was one palette that I am
going to return I still have the box for
um and I talked about this so I won't
talk about this for too long I talked
about it in my five palettes that I've
given up on this is the busy art golden
hour palette now it's pretty I like the
packaging of it but again it's expensive
and these were just colors and never use
very basic which to please you know I
love basic colors I love neutral colors
so I nothing against it there but I just
felt like the colors that are in here
that I would actually wear I have in
every single other palette I own and
then the ones I maybe wouldn't
necessarily wear I'd only care about so
it's like why did I buy this palette I
got some primers first off is the
Smashbox primer Iser that I picked up I
really like it I really do I have so
many primers right now though I feel
like I keep shoving this one to the side
and I feel bad for it because it's
really nice it's very moisturizing holds
on to your makeup nicely this is one
that as I am trying more primers out I'm
starting to declutter some and there's
just less riffraff in the way I feel
like this is one that I will use all of
the time I've been using it a lot but
like I said I'm trying out so many
primers right now I feel like this one's
getting shoved to the side but really
moisturizing if you have dry skin I
think you're gonna like this it's not so
moisturizing that it's like a thick
heavy cream but it's just a nice kind of
lighter moisturizer that it just feels
good on your skin and I feel like my dry
patches don't shine through as much when
I'm using this as my primer and for that
I do like it and I do like that it has a
pump as well another primer I got in the
hall after that this that one was the
Fenty beauty primer this one I I do like
I actually I don't think it's bad again
it's kind of a moisturizing cream kind
of a primer I do think it does help with
my dry spots which
good and the reason they say to pair
this with the fancy beauty foundation is
because that Fenty beauty foundation is
a little bit more of a dry formula and
so this is meant to be paired with it so
it kind of counteracts the dryness of it
so it is a more of a moisturizing primer
which i think is really nice
I thought the packaging of course was
freaking gorgeous I don't know why why
are we all so obsessed with this like
pale cream color right now it is pretty
I liked it
do I think it's anything like that
stands out that I'm like oh my gosh
everyone needs it not really
I think I'd recommend the primer eyes
are over this but I do like it I mean
this is something that I will probably
use up all the way to the end would I
repurchase it however maybe not but I'm
excited to try it even more again as I
get rid of some more primers I've gotten
way too many right now I'm on like a
huge primer and foundation kick it's
crazy so a powder I purchased was the
Urban Decay Velvet Iser I have not done
the thing where you mix it in with
foundation I'm sure you guys are like
what like that's what it's meant to be
used for I've only used it as a setting
powder and it's really cool as a setting
powder because it's it really does have
this weird weird texture different than
any other loose powder I've ever tried
it's just weird it it's almost like
freaky but in a cool way
it really does smooth your skin out it's
crazy if I'm having a dry skin day this
is OK on top of it I just try to avoid
powder altogether when I'm super super
dry but this is still okay on top of dry
skin and I think that's pretty cool
because that's pretty rare to find but
because this is so ridiculously thin it
does a good job so I promise I will try
it mix them in Foundation let you guys
know how it is um I haven't put it
underneath I don't I I don't think
that's gonna be good for my skin I need
to try at least once but I can't foresee
that being nice on my skin alright so I
had also picked up the lemare foundation
I finally got the shade that I should be
in which is ivory 0-2 after trying many
many shades 110 dollars never purchase
something so expensive in my life other
than that freaking Natasha Genoa star
palette when it comes to makeup
I'm still trying it out guys I'm I've
worn this and some days I'm like oh my
gosh it looks so amazing and then there
are other days I'll wear it and I'm like
oh it's weird and so I'm trying to
figure out what is the right primer
cocktail to do it you know and I mean
what primer should I do I need a more
pore filling one do I need a more
moisturizing one well I think this is
very moisturizing so if you have dry
skin I think you'll really like it
oily skin I don't know um and I think
that a lot of you guys have told me you
know Jessica it's such a nice expensive
foundation you probably don't need
primer with it I'm like good point so I
tried it without primer and it did look
pretty nice so you know I think when you
are spending that much freaking money on
a foundation you almost shouldn't need
to have primer on because it should be
so good that you need nothing but the
foundation you know what I mean
but I do think it's pretty darn
moisturizing it has SPF of 20 and of
course the packaging is nice so again I
feel like I still can't give you my full
thoughts because I with something this
expensive I'm not playing around like I
don't want to just flippantly say oh
yeah it's so great go buy it because it
is expensive and I don't take for
granted that you guys are trusting me to
give you absolutely my full thoughts on
something this for getting expensive so
still trying you know I do like it but
nobody go run out buy it just yet unless
you like already know that you need it
and love would love it um
alright I did buy a couple brushes and I
have been loving both and I think it's
very rare that I just pick out singular
brushes and buy them and these were two
that for whatever reason that stood out
to me and I bought them and I love both
so one that I've been using a ton I even
used today is the Sephora Pro airbrush
concealer it's the brush number 57 I've
been using this I'll dip it in like a
potted concealer to cover blemishes
perfect for that absolutely perfect for
that now do you need to spend cuz I
think this is still you know somewhat
pricey do you need to spend the money
out not really I mean you could do that
with any brush so I do really like it
but I don't think you have to have that
brush this one I really like though this
is the honest hacia a 23 it's like a
targeted highlighting brush I really
like it it's kind of a medium sized
people will use like almost brushes this
size for that and of course I've got
bigger ones as well but I really like
this for when I'm doing like what you
see they're a very targeted highlight
and I'm yeah I did use this today to put
that on so I really did like this I like
the way it flares out this is one I
would recommend I do really like that
brush did I say that enough Oh
oh my gosh I bought this powder I wasn't
sure if I would like it or not it's from
Laura Mercier and it's their candle glow
shear perfecting powder you put it all
over your face it totally reminds me of
the hourglass dim light powder that I
put all over my face and it makes it
look like you're literally in
candlelight well this one has the name
that fits candle glow powder it's just
so pretty it has this kind of shimmery
ish quality to it where again especially
if you have drier skin it just makes
your skin look like it's lit from within
and beautiful and it's a powder it's
crazy and I really really really like it
a lot falling more and more in love with
Laura Mercier products and that scares
me because they're expensive my drawers
like I've had those for a long day I
can't point those had for a very long
time years and years and I swear they're
haunted because I'll open one and it'll
open the other and then I'll try to shut
it and the other will open father yeah
it's not really hard on guys but it's
kind of fun to think that way it's not
fun to think that way what's wrong with
you Jessica
alright I would actually be really scary
let's stop talking about it so I also
got the NARS smudge proof eyeshadow base
I like this stuff
I really do I like that it's don't foot
because I can use go poopoo poop like a
couple dots on each and then just with
both fingers at the same time kind of
tap it in really quick it kind of comes
across as like sort of white but it
completely blends translucent whereas I
have a Smashbox one that's actually the
one I accidentally grabbed and I had to
swap course I'm like that wasn't the one
I bought but I bought the Smashbox lid
primer in white and that one really does
have more of a white base which I think
I like that one more than this NARS one
because that white base really makes any
eye shadow you put on top of it really
pop whether it's colors or neutrals
doesn't really matter so that's why I
think I like that one more cuz this one
does become translucent both of them
hold onto the shadow really well
I will link the Smashbox 1 below as well
if you are kind of into that kind of a
thing but it also has a doe foot but do
I think this NARS one is worth the price
know like the Ulta matte eye primer that
I fell in love with absolutely honestly
probably a little bit better and like
1/4 of the price so I will link that one
if you're curious um alright so I also
had bought this flash fix little set
from Sunday Riley it was the good jeans
lactic acid and the ceramics lip clay
cleanser I've used the clay cleanser a
couple times it's good I mean it just
feels like a nice cleanser to me the
seer of a hydrogen cleanser feels the
same way so do I am I ever gonna buy a
full-size of this no just cuz I don't
need to the freaking good jeans is
really freakin good I hate that it's
good cuz the like actual full sizes of
this are like around $100 some of them
are even more depending on the size you
get but it exfoliates your skin from the
inside out and it it smells really nice
which you know what skincare you don't
necessarily always want fragrance
because sometimes that can be an
irritant but it really does smell nice
man like I'm trying to use it sparingly
but I'm like oh my gosh I feel like the
mornings I use this like I'll use it at
night I don't use it the morning I'll
use it night in the morning I wake up
I'll look and be like my skin just looks
like revives like overnight it was
working and oh my gosh I have been using
the ordinary lactic acid treatment as
well because I had already had that and
that has such a pungent smell like I'm
not in a good way it kind of makes me
sick to my stomach now I am pregnant so
that could be a part of it but it is
pungent so if you have the ordinary
lactic acid treatment let me know as
yours like crazy strong smelling does it
make you sick too tightens it it is
super strong um it's not exactly the
same thing as far as I know now again
I'm not a dermatologist I'm not a I like
skincare but I don't know a lot about
skincare I'm still learning so I know
that they have different ingredients in
them they both have the lactic acid but
anyway I really do like this OH
so an awesome thing though this is
expensive it is but not nearly as
expensive as that is the belief the true
moisturizing balm I really like this
stuff I kind of taken a pause using it
because I'm trying to use up the drunk
elephant one that I have that it's okay
the Lala retro whipped cream it's okay I
don't love it
it's alright so I'm trying to use it up
so I'm like that was so expensive and
you know there's nothing really wrong
with it so I made myself pause using
this to finish that one I'm still
finishing it I feel like it will never
end but I really really like this I used
it for a week or two it's super
moisturizing it's definitely more of
almost like not a gel but definitely has
that kind of gel like feel to it and I
do think it's super moisturizing so if
you're dry skin especially in the winter
and you need a moisturizer right now and
you can afford it or there's sale or
whatever oh oh oh I love this so this is
what I used to my hair today this is the
Brio Gio curl charisma no not sponsored
by them I have worked with them in the
past but this one I genuinely just
bought it's their curl charisma
rice amino plus avocado leave-in
defining creams so I use it okay how do
I do my hair when it's naturally like
wavy ish like this I'll put this in
first so I'll flip my hair upside down
and I'll literally just squirt a whole
big build all up in my hand and rub it
between my hands and I'll just kind of
rub it into my hair and it smells good I
feel like it holds my curls / waves
together a little bit better I do still
go in at the moose from living proof
which I can link below I love but I've
been really looking for a great defining
cream and I really do like this so this
is something I could see myself buying
again and really not only does it work
well but I really like the smell and
that's kind of a big deal in your hair
you know when you're like you smell good
so here's something that smells terrible
it's the way memory mist it says for use
before you Styles like you can use it
like as heat protected blah blah blah I
don't use a lot of heat on my hair other
than blow-dryer which is obviously heat
as well but like I don't really
straighten my hair very often or like
use a curling wand I used to do it a lot
but I've been going au naturale a lot it
just smells bad
like okay I shouldn't say it smells bad
some people will love the smell I don't
and again could be being pregnant it's
up my nose as I'm smelling it more I
could see how people would like this
it's a very hairstyle II kind of a smell
but there's something about it that
bothers me again it could be being
pregnant I don't know but it really
bothered me in the scent really lingered
so if you like the smell boy you'll love
it because it will linger around all day
but if you don't it will linger all day
I don't think I can use it I might wait
like literally just put it in a drawer
until I'm no longer pregnant and we'll
see if it bothers me because it was so
expensive and I do feel like it held on
to my hair nicely kind of I didn't use
it as much as a heat protectant as I did
just like a texturizing spray would I
repurchase probably not just cuz I feel
like I can find texturizing spray for
cheaper if that's really all I'm using
it for you know what I mean
fun extra side note this is not a part
of this but what I'm wearing on my lips
I'm trying my first dose of colors like
matte liquid lipstick thing in the shade
stone which is like a cult classic I
really like it I'm not you guys know I'm
not like big on liquid lipsticks but
this one actually it's kind of
comfortable like it's a little bit
stickier which I kind of like I just
this is like my first dose of colors
purchase ever because it's now at Ulta
right not Sephora Ulta or is its fourth
either way so I'm just excited to try it
I figured I would share what's on my
lips if you were curious so those were
all the ones I'm gonna include today if
I didn't mention any that you were still
curious about for one reason or another
let me know the list was so long I tried
to grab everything I could find but
definitely let me know and what are your
favorites right now from Sephora as I'm
looking into the new year you know we're
just starting 2018 and as I think about
like you know what new brands do I want
to try this year what new types of
products let me know what you think I
should try what I should branch out and
try whether it's a brand maybe it's an
indie brand maybe it's a you know
Sephora brand but no one's really
talking about them just let me know down
below I'm always curious and other than
that I hope you'll subscribe and I'll
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
