another Sephora haul this was the last
haul I made during the vib sale I wasn't
gonna do it I wasn't gonna do it but
then I was like oh but the vib sale the
next one is not to like Nick cheer and
like I don't know I was just in the mood
and I was like these are all a lot of
the things that got are things I've
heard they're kind of like cult
favorites that I'm tired of hearing
about and I just wanted to try for
myself some of these I bit the bullet
and bought some expensive expensive
things that I never thought I would buy
but I figure obviously I'll review here
let you guys know if I think it's worth
the money and if I genuinely hate it I
can always return it so before I get too
far into it my very first Sephora vib
sale haul was sponsor but you bakes this
one's not but I always like to mention
it to you guys because on this order
alone I spent like I want to say close
to $500 which means I got it was like 4
percent cash back when I place the order
I got $20 back in my teammates account
like actual money and you get paid
quarterly it's super easy I'll put my
link it is a referral link but I'll put
it down in the description box it's so
easy free to use it's not sketchy I
promise I've been using it for like five
years now and a lot of you guys use it
too so if you've had the experience with
it let us know below that way you can
trust other people on top of my word but
it's awesome
I use it every time I buy anything
online and I just get money from it it's
so easy so like I said link will be
below let's go and get into it I'm like
nervous it's a lot of money nice book
and I already spent a lot of money
alright first thing let's just start
with what I'm wearing on my lips this is
the Penta Fenty Beauty Universal bloss
balm
alright let me grab the box um yeah
gloss balm the universal lip Luminizer I
put it on there's something about the
smell of this it smells like one of
those like bonnibel lip glosses that I
used to wear that smells so good it
reminds me of that so right away when I
was putting it on I was like oh my gosh
like huge doe foot applicator
I literally just put it on like five
minutes ago for the very first time so
obviously this haul is not going to be
very helpful unless I update you and how
I'm liking it so I will definitely do a
haul update video in like a month after
I've gotten to try all these things as I
always do so definitely subscribe and
stay tuned for that that way you
get to know my feelings on this cuz this
is truly just swatches and me telling
you what I got in my first kind of
feelings towards it anyway so I like it
I I like that the packaging is kind of
different it's a pentagonal shaped a
little tube here and it says FB on the
top I mean it feels very high quality I
just like that it's kind of clear let me
show you a swatch it's clear but it has
a little bit of a tint to it and it just
feels good and I just like it
simba or bate Pinocchio sleeping like
right there his cousin Simba who were
babysitting for a week or two is here
just lay it and go boy you hear the
snorts that would be the Pug obviously
I'll be trying this out for the next
month I'll let you guys know the next
thing I got I've been dying to try and I
am so excited to try this and then
compare it to way more inexpensive
products and let you guys know okay do
you really need this one as money or can
you really find the same thing at the
drugstore or for cheaper this is the
lemare the soft fluid long-wear
foundation this stuff I'm so tired of
hearing about bottle feels really nice
like a frosted glass bottle very hefty
really nice cap a very nice pump um I
got the shade linen which so hard to
pick online I think it's just a little
too deep for me I think in the summer
time it'd be just fine
well honestly that might be perfect I'm
testing out a foundation today so I
don't let me just try it actually that
might work pretty well hey I was so
concerned that it wouldn't but actually
I think that'll work really well so hmm
Linden maybe it's just right cuz I felt
like the one underneath it was just too
light so this is maybe the better option
anyway I haven't tried it on my face
right now I'm wearing the Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation that I've been
trying out again I tried it years ago
anyway um so I'm curious about it says
long-wear but it fail it feels very
liquidy and very light so I'm so curious
to try it and see like I've heard some
people love it that it looks really it's
like the perfect foundation it lets your
skin breathe and glow but it's still
long wearing and then I've also heard
other people say no it didn't have
enough
Bridget Simba just lay down I know
there's a big storm and I think they're
kind of freaked out all right you can
sit right next to me you just want to
see him he's crazy hi this is Simba when
I lived with my parents before I got
married he was my well he wasn't my dog
he's my parents dog but he's been a
while for a long time
so I love babysitting him he likes to be
on laps though he will jump he can jump
like this hi he's the craziest pug we
had another pug before him growing up he
recently died he was so old though it
was kind of like near sad but it was
like he was suffering anyway um
but he is so different he's so like
hyperactive and crazy and anxious and he
needs like a thunder jacket at all times
don't you he doesn't have one but I feel
like you could benefit from one anyway
um so
pinoke I mean Simba I keep going on the
wrong names I'm like their parents all
right little Simba Lolita all right
anyway so I'll have to update you on
this but what I was saying is I feel
like a lot of people say that there's
not enough coverage and it's totally not
worth the money so it must depend on
your skin type so I'm curious if I'll
like it or hate it I will definitely let
you know I can't believe I spent that
much money but then the next product I'm
about to show you I really can't believe
I spent this much money because I've
never tried anything from her I wanted
to try Natasha de Nonna I I feel like
this brand came out of nowhere like
suddenly it was like overnight ever it
was like Oh Natasha's Nonna and I'm like
I've never heard of this person this
brand this mega you know and everyone's
like oh there's the best shadows in the
whole wide world ever ever ever I'm like
okay and then I look at the price tag of
mine they freaking better be there's
like a I think this was like a hundred
and sixty-nine dollars some of our
palates are over to Indra like is that
right or something like that maybe this
was 120 does it matter
it was ridiculously expensive and of
course I'll have links below for all of
these if I don't mention the price you
can click on the link check it out
because some of the things I got are
cheaper and you can maybe afford these
are ridiculous
but I did swatch them and I will say I
don't like that there's this flat
I don't like that what what is that that
feels incredibly cheap I get that it's
to kind of hold the powder in - but no I
don't like it I might rip it out we'll
see because that's I have a feeling
that's going to drive me crazy I really
liked the grouping of colors in this
there were enough little pops that I
would actually wear so just to give you
an idea the shimmers kick up a lot of
powder which surprised me like really it
did but they are so gorgeous so it's
like you just have to be careful to tap
off your brush before you put it on and
you want to have a good sticky primer
underneath so as long as you've got a
nice sticky primer under this eye I mean
obviously it's going to be gorgeous I
haven't tried it on my eyes I'm dying to
try it today I'm wearing like the gigi
hadid line from Maybelline I just did a
review video if it's up I will link it
below if it's not stay tuned some things
I love some things I didn't love but
that's what's on my eyes today if you
were curious but the shimmers are
gorgeous the masts even like the really
light once watched really well and that
is very rare I feel like every palette
that has a light matte it barely shows
up it does well with the brush but it
barely shows up when you're like just
fingers watching I'm very curious to see
fallout wise especially at the shimmer
some of them have true glitter in them
so you really need to use like a glitter
primer maybe even some fix+
so I'll have to let you guys know how
the fallout is because I have a feeling
it might be a lot the next thing I got
was from Laura Mercier and I've only
heard a couple people talk about this
but it sounded like it was right up my
alley
it's the Laura Mercier candle glow shear
perfecting powder and I got it in the
shade one I'm not sure if there are a
ton of shades but I guess the idea this
it sounds like it's similar to the
hourglass powder where it doesn't have
shimmer in it but it's just this glowy
powder you can put it all over your face
like a regular powder and it sets your
makeup but it has a glow to it and that
is totally what I like to do I feel like
it's one of those kind of secret weapon
products that you put on and people are
like oh my gosh she always her skin
looks so healthy and it's really just
like a powder like this so it does look
a lot like the hourglass
dim light powder call the ring yeah
even shade wise these look really
similar let's see yeah they are like the
same product so I'll let you know how
the laura mercier one is I have noticed
that the dim light is almost a little
too dark for me and sometimes when I put
it on I'll have a little bit of like
darkness there which is kind of weird
and I think this is just a tinge bit
lighter so maybe it'll be actually
better for me in the long run they both
just got a bone and Simba is pretend
burying it so he you know anyone have a
dog that does that he like pretends to
brush dirt on a bone that's clearly
visible to anyone but he thinks he's
burying it it's actually really cute
this video is a train wreck I'm so sorry
guys there's so much like noise there's
a storm there's pugs sniffing so it okay
the next thing I got is from these art
which is their golden hour palette I
love I have their natural mats palette
let me show it to you so this is their
sorry neutral matte palette that I
already own and the mats are amazing
they blend like a dream I mean it's
totally - okey oh you're too big to be
on my lap buddy you really are sorry so
but simple was up there um so I really
I've always loved this pal again it's
really expensive but it's amazing well
this one has oh my gosh this is so cool
let me peel off the side so it's got
this like metal front
it's just cool pack you know mine's a
little dented that's okay got this metal
front and like a matte plastic backing
and then it's got this amazingly giant
mirror and these nine shades and there
let's see one two three four five our
shimmery and four or not
but it I've never tried they're shimmers
so I was really intrigued to try these
they don't kick up a lot of powder
they're pretty but I think they're
really more known for their mats so I
was just so curious to try these
especially like when compared with like
the natasha de Nonna
well he found a way to get on my lap
anyway alright the next thing I got was
this little kit I've been dying to try
the Sunday Riley good genes lactic acid
treatment and I'm
she's been using one from the ordinary
it's just their lactic acid plus I want
to say hyaluronic acid is in it and I've
really been liking that I feel like it's
really helping my skin guys I have eyes
shadow just full-on on my forehead from
dealing with these dogs so I found I
didn't want to spend the redonkulous
price on the good genes treatment if
I've never tried it so I found this
flash fix which was a lot cheaper of
course they're smaller size but it also
comes with their ceramic slip clay
cleanser which I've heard pretty good
things about so it's really just buying
it for this but I'm excited to try both
I'll let you know because this the good
jeans is so expensive and people swear
by it so I'm like if it's that good it
might be worth it but having not tried
it I didn't want to invest like $80 or
whatever in one so I was really excited
to find this cheaper kits um I also
bought this Clarisonic set but it comes
with two radiance brush brush heads one
deep pore brush head and one of their
foundation brush now I had never tried
this when I ordered it however literally
a couple days before I got this package
I got a PR package from Clarisonic with
the foundation brush head in it and I
was like of course so I'm thinking about
returning this cuz I'm like well if I
already have it I just wanted to try it
out I do like it though so that I'm like
well maybe I want to back up and I do
use my Clarisonic a couple times a week
so it is nice to have so I might keep it
anyway because I'll definitely use it I
really I like my Clarisonic it's grown
on me more and more because when I wear
full faces of makeup all the time it
does feel like you're kind of getting it
off a little bit more I don't like to
use it every single night so I would say
2 to 3 times a week I use it maybe just
every other day just to really get
everything out of my skin I I do like
and the reality is it's one of those
investments that you buy at once it's
pretty much gonna last you years and
years and years now you do need to
replace the heads from time to time for
sure but I do love it I also got because
I'm tired of hearing about him this
shisei no facial Cotton's wears kind of
I was kind of laughing though because
everyone's like ok it's support vib i
refilled my Shiseido facial Cotton's I
love these 20% off was the best time to
get them so I really stock up but these
are $10 which is ridiculous for cotton I
mean it is but 20% off is only
two dollars off so it's not like a huge
you know $30 savings on it and I think
that's what made me laugh when I thought
about I was like well it's not I'll take
the $2.00 off trust me and if I end up
loving these I probably will buy them
near the sale because that's still money
you're saving but it just kind of made
me laugh because I'm like it's not that
much off but let's open these bad boys I
want to feel why are these so soft why
are people holy crap
okay yeah they're pretty insane Lee soft
I mean they feel like genuine just come
these are weirdly soft like feels like a
freaking pillow oh my gosh okay
I kind of get it I'm gonna use it cuz I
do use a cotton pad for like essence or
toner typically sometimes I'll use it
for like spot treating like if I just
get a little bit um I don't know so I am
I will let you know are these worth to
ten dollars or eight dollars during a
vib sale waitin Z alright the next thing
I got was this belief set it was $38
which I think it was Stephanie Nicole
that sold me on this cuz I totally trust
her opinion and it's this whole set and
it's this full-size of their belief the
true cream moisturizing balm which
apparently is like the best if you have
dry skin and I was like I dry skin
what's the best so I've been dying to
try it well the full size itself is $38
and this kid is $38 so I figure well I
might as well get the kit then because
then I get to try these two products
which is their moisturizing eye balm
balm not balm balm um so I figure that's
perfect little travel size and then
they're Hungarian water essence so it
says increased hydration level 20%
that's pretty cool
so I figure why not try to other
products for the exact same price and
I'm just so let's open this I've been
using the drunk elephant moisturizer
it's like their la la retro it's nice
but I don't I don't know like I feel
like I've tried other moisturizers that
like blew me away and they were cheaper
and so it makes me feel like mmm is it
really worth the money
I don't know so this is kind of a
thicker cream it looks gel like but it
is thicker it has kind of a
not really a fragrance maybe a slight
fragrance but it's nothing super strong
that I think would bother you um it
might not have a fragrance at all
it does feel really moisturizing oh my
gosh I wish you guys could feel my hands
so again I'll try this out for the next
month I'm just gonna swap it like I said
the trunk elephant stuff is not bad but
it's super expensive like I feel like
this is cheaper than that and this might
be better we'll see so I will link all
these below including like the little
kits that I got if you are interested in
them I love shopping I've gotta like
slow down though because it is the
holidays after all and we've got gifts
to buy and things but it's there's
something about the holidays that makes
you like there's like new stuff out and
you're like oh there's all these kits
and gifts and so you want to buy them
for yourself so obviously you know back
your head that you're like okay but also
gift-giving season stop spending money
on your freaking self you selfish brat
so I hope you enjoyed this like I
mentioned earlier use Ebates before you
do you'll make some money back it's
super easy
