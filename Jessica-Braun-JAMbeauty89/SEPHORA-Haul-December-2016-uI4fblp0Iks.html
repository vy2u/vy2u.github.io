gonna share with you guys my latest
Sephora haul I feel like I can't stop
buying stuff from Sephora it's horrible
and awesome but horrible and then they
had the vib seal which actually this is
stuff I bought during that sale but I'm
kind of trying it out for a while
wanting to be able to give you guys some
mini reviews as I go and there's also
some things I'm returning to Sephora cuz
I didn't like them and they were really
expensive so I'm glad I'll get my money
back but I want to mention them to you
because I don't want you guys to get
duped into this and it's actually a
product that so many youtubers recommend
and I hated it so let's go and get into
it so the first thing I bought I finally
got sucked into but now I get it
and I almost don't want to get it
because I'm like this is so expensive
like but it's so good this is the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette I'm not
gonna talk this to death it's as good as
people say this now I looked at it and I
was like what like I use it today on my
eyes in fact that's all I use today on
my eyes other than I use this drugstore
Maybelline Color tattoo in charcoal
chrome on my lower lashline love that
stuff it was in my November favorites
but this I looked at it I was like I
don't think I'm gonna get enough use of
all these matte colors I am surprised
like today I used this kind of burgundy
color in my crease as well as this kind
of peach one and the brown and the black
and the light white and that like I use
so many all together but they blend
unbelievably so that color like that
reddish color I probably wouldn't have
worn normally but because I know that
these blend so much better than like any
other eyeshadow I've ever used in my
entire life I know that if I get it like
kind of weird it's okay cuz it'll blend
out perfectly where I was like I feel
like colors like this if I've tried it
even honestly even with like matte
shadows I can't blend it very well so
then it just looks crazy all day and
then I'm like forget it why did I even
try something out of my comfort zone so
I love this for that reason that I am
going out of my comfort zone even though
these are all still neutral II but so I
love it if you are kind of just like in
a rut or maybe you're just like you know
I like matte shadows but I feel like
they never blend well these are the
answer alright the next thing I got I
saved the
spor um these are the bass ma
brightening setting powders and it comes
with three this was inspired I think it
was Emily in a while I saw by these and
I was like now if you recall and if
anyone can remember the video or maybe a
couple I bought a bass ma or maybe I got
one I don't know a Besame lipstick a
long time ago and it was like in Cherry
something or maybe as a bright pink I
think I've sensed a cluttered it and I
so regret it but it was years ago when I
lived with my parents way before I was
married when I first started my channel
I fell in love with that lipstick format
their lipsticks aren't incredible but
they kind of have that vintage feel of
makeup that's the whole idea behind
their stuff well this came with three of
their loose brightening setting powders
and so it comes in vanilla rose and just
their traditional translucent and then
my personal favorite violet I wore
violet I am wearing violet under my eyes
I feel like it does an amazing job
brightening it it does have kind of a
purplish tint to it but it totally
totally brightens the translucence nice
and then the one I haven't really given
as much of a go and buy as much I mean I
haven't tried it all
and the thing is so on it is the pink
one this one really does have a pink
tint to it but again it's not that
different than the purple and the
translucent but I really do like these
and I like the idea and it could just be
a placebo effect but I like the idea
that there are different tones to it so
I've really been using this purple one a
lot and yeah I just I think this was
totally worth the money I'm not gonna
run out of these anytime soon because I
don't use these for my entire face I
just use them under my eyes so it's
gonna take me forever to go through even
one of these so I love that love love
love and the packaging is so cute the
next thing I got roped into was this not
the eyeshadows in it
this Sephora collection Z palette it's I
assume limited edition but it's just got
this gorgeous golden sparkly look to it
and I was like please I'm gonna need
that stat so I love it I've got my
favorite shadows a lot of these are Mac
a lot of them are carroty as I mentioned
always carry shadows are just the
good as the Mac one so some of them are
better so I'll link my dukes video
although now Mac has lowered their the
price of their shadow so it almost
doesn't matter but the carry ones were
honestly better but anyway these are
just tons of shadows that I love so I
love having them all together and they
just look even prettier than this so I
literally was like I don't need that but
I need that so I bought it at least say
the 20% off although I'm like wow 20%
off but at the end of the day like I
look at it I'm like well I was still way
too much money for that alright let's go
ahead and talk about the one thing I
don't like that I'm in a return you
might be surprised this is the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation you know
cute packaging nothing that's special
but it's Giorgio Armani so it's like
extra special right I mean you spend the
money in your life wow I don't even know
what to say about this stuff it's it's a
thinner ish consistency it offers light
to medium coverage it doesn't really
cover anymore the more you put on it's
just the same amount of coverage and
it's not really luminous but it's also
not matte which I don't mind I kind of
like that in between kind of satin look
but I didn't feel like you did anything
it just broke up all over my forehead
and I don't have oily skin foundation
doesn't usually break up on me so I was
very surprised at how bad this looked on
my skin and so it made my skin look bad
and I mean honestly like the week or so
that I wore this I wore it with so many
different primers without primers I mean
I tried everything different setting
powers no setting powder you know it
didn't seem to matter it always looked
the same right away when I applied it it
didn't look good but especially by the
end of my work day so I was just so
unimpressed and underwhelmed and I don't
really get why everyone likes this of
course I know we all have different skin
and that that just must be it that it
just didn't mesh well with my skin but
if you've got skin like mine like my
skin meshes really well with the Revlon
Colorstay normal to dry I really like
the elf flawless foundation so if you
know your skin does well with those then
you might not like this I don't know I
am returning it I'm also returning to
other foundations to support
from the last time let me just grab them
I'm also returning to other really I see
I'm on the hunt to find amazing high-end
foundations I like drugstore once better
this is the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation this stuff my skin is normal
to dry so I do us and dry patches and
we're heading into where well we're in
winter so this stuff just looked so dry
on my skin that's all I have to say
about it it just looked so dry it was
bad so if you have oily skin I think
you'll love it because I don't think
it's you know it's not really good
coverage which is nice and my skin
looked great from far away but anytime I
mean if you got within 3 feet of me
you'd be like and then this one kind of
the same thing
also I think this one was just maybe a
little too light for me this is the Kat
Von D lock-it foundation I don't know I
just really like it this is in light 45
warm I thought it'd be a good shade for
me but maybe it wasn't too light what
was wrong with this one I think it was
just too much for what I needed like I
didn't need this much coverage and I
think that was really the main thing it
was just more coverage than I ever need
part of me is tempted to keep it but I
know that the part of me that's tempted
to keep it is just one that's like a
hoarder and I just want to keep
everything but I never wanted to reach
this I never really wanted it so why
keep it all right so one high-end
product that I'm liking a lot though was
the Marc Jacobs primer and it's their
invisible undercover perfecting coconut
face primer I really like this stuff now
I really liked the Too Faced hangover RX
primer and it's that kind of similar
coconut e or moisturizing primer so it's
not pore filling but it is just
moisturizing and as we're heading into
winter I think this is exactly what I
need cuz I'm not you know in the winter
I'm not sweating off my makeup or
anything like that so I do want
something that's really moisturizing and
good for my skin and I'm really liking
this a lot but a little bit cheaper of
one is that Too Faced hangover one and I
do like that one as well so I can link
both of them below so speaking of loose
powders another thing I got is the NARS
translucent crystal light reflecting
setting powder I've only tried this a
couple times I'm wearing it today it
does have like micro glitters in it but
when I
saw it I was like what like I got it cuz
I ordered these online so when I first
saw them like - there's glitter in there
but it's so fine you don't see it like
even when I'm up close like I've got my
mirror here I mean maybe you see it but
I mean not really it's not like other
products I've used that have that micro
glitter and I'm like oh my gosh yikes no
it's not like that it's just so flawless
and it definitely has a white cast when
you first put it on but what I'll do is
I'll put it on with like a floor puff
and then I'll kind of brush off all the
rest and it usually looks really nice
now if you notice it looks cakey on you
I would say just throw a setting spray
or some kind of spray like that on and
it's gonna melt it right into your skin
anyway but so far I like it the last few
things I got this bite discovery set I
am falling in love with bite Beauty I
liked their lipsticks their amuse-bouche
lipsticks but this one came with four
different things now you're gonna giggle
because one of the things is not in this
kit because I have it at school and I've
been using it every single day this week
so the first thing what I love about
this is for the price you're getting
basically full-size things I think maybe
the agave lip mask isn't the full size
but it's still a lot so it comes with
the amuse bouche lipstick in beetroots
which is actually it looks like what I'm
wearing on my lips right now but this is
not what I'm wearing on my lips right
now let's put some on though yeah I
blended right in so if you like the
color I'm wearing which is the
colour-pop liquid lipstick in bad habit
if you like that color this is just like
it now I use bite products at school
because as I'm teaching you know I'm
drinking coffee during my breaks and
drinking water throughout the day and
talking talking talking talking I don't
have time to touch up and I don't want
to have to worry about it all over
myself and like wearing off weird but
what I love about about bite lipsticks
is they're comfortable and as they wear
off I can go like this and know that
it's kind of blending together and it's
just like it doesn't look dry and
cracked it's just comfortable good for
your skin food grade ingredients so I
just like these the one I have at school
like of this
lipstick is called fig which is like one
of their bestsellers I love and then the
main reason I wanted to get this set
okay there were like a million reasons
but the full-size what do they actually
call it matte cream lip crayon and it's
in leche and it's just this natural kind
of everyday nude for my skin tone type
of a color I love it I love that it is a
thinner pencil so you can fill in your
lips but you can also line with it so
I've been wearing that a lot and then
this I was excited to try their agave
lip mask now I don't think this is the
full size but it's still a decent amount
that's gonna take me a while to go
through it has a consistency like a
petroleum jelly type consistency but
it's really really comfortable it smells
fantastic
I just I'm liking it so far this is one
of those things that if I really like it
I'll probably buy the full size up and
then the last thing in this kit is did I
tell you what the kit was called it's
the bite discovery set I think I said
that the last thing in here is their
Deluxe line and define primer so it's
just like a clear looks white but it's
just a clear kind of primer type thing
it it is kind of moisturizing it smells
minty so I haven't tried this yet I'm
excited to try it again especially as we
go into winter when I'm putting on
lipstick I want my lipstick to stay but
I also don't want it to be so dry and
gross because my lips are already gonna
be dry because it's winter so although
hopefully the agave lip mask will help
them so I was very impressed with this
and then it's got the cute little tin
that it usually comes with so that was
everything I got from Sephora this time
around and some things of course that
I'm returning as I mentioned I hope you
enjoyed this if you're interested in my
Sephora Holiday Gift Guide that I did
actually with Sephora and that was very
very exciting for me the exciting moment
in my little youtube career here but if
you're interested in seeing what I would
recommend and some of the things they
have for the holidays that are really
cool I can link that video below other
than that I hope you'll catch me on my
social media right there it's all GM you
