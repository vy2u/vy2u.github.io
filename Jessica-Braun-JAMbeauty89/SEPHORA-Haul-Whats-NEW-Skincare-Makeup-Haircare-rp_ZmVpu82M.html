mug yet one of our like family friends
that we've known forever made these for
Tyler and me it says mom is sad she has
an 18 that has my name and then Tyler's
of course says dad that has his name
it's awesome and it's in the Disney fall
I love it so this is a very special gift
but that aside today we're going to be
talking about a bunch a bunch of new
makeup I bought from Sephora so I love
trying new products that's my job and I
these are all products that I have been
kind of on my radar for different
reasons and some of them I have tried a
lot of them I'm wearing today and I'll
talk about that and then some of them
are repurchases and a lot of them are
just brand new things brand new skincare
haircare makeup so we're gonna start
with the makeup today cuz I figured most
of you guys are interested in that and
then we'll slide into I've got a lot of
skin care and hair stuff so all right
I'm excited I've been waiting to do this
video because I've had this stuff for a
while and it just it finally worked out
to be able to sit down and do it so
let's start with the foundation I
actually did it get ready with me and I
tried this in that get ready with me so
Laura Mercier flawless fusion foundation
the colors not great which that's my own
fault you know I was trying to shade
match myself online so that I can't
fault this for for those that have said
it's such a flawless you know hence the
name flawless fusion flawless finish I
don't know and I'm still developing my
opinion cuz now I've used it for maybe
maybe a week now that I'm sitting down
maybe like five days this week but I
just feel like I can't find the right
combo where my skin is hydrated enough
underneath where it still looks nice
because for me I need a little coverage
but I don't want it to look super cakey
in person cuz I'm interacting with
people in real life in person and I
don't know like that that's something
that I personally don't like on myself
so with that in mind I don't know that
this is the foundation for me I could
see if you are someone that either
really really likes high coverage
foundations or or like you really need
it you know cuz there there are cases
where you do want that higher coverage
or if you're someone that you have been
looking for a foundation that's high
coverage but you don't want it to be
super thick because I feel like a lot of
high coverage foundations can be more
like whip
thick and I really especially for dry
skin really doesn't work this is a much
thinner consistency crazy high coverage
with one layer and you can of course
build it up with a second layer if you
really wanted so I don't know that by
the way I have it in the shade vanilla
one in two it's just a little yellow by
the way if you were curious about what
if you saw my get ready with me you'd
see like oh yeah that is
that's pretty yellow I don't know I just
feel kind of I guess wishy-washy kind of
regretting buying this but I want to
keep trying and making make sure that
it's not that I I need to make sure I
find the right combo with it because if
I could make it work I want to make it
work but I hope that makes sense I think
this is a good foundation for people
that are like what I described but it's
not gonna be for everyone okay alright
so something that I do think is really
awesome for everyone I waited forever to
buy this cuz I was like Jessica you
don't need that it's the hourglass
vanish highlighter stick and I got
champagne flash I held out on this cuz I
was like Jessica you don't need another
cream highlight you've got a couple you
already absolutely love and you know I
don't use a cream highlight every single
day however it has kind of quickly
become my favorite mode of putting
highlighter on with any cream highlight
I'll just kind of dip my sponge in it
and just apply it there and it looks so
natural it doesn't look pottery it
doesn't seem to emphasize my fine lines
or dry skin so I really am leaning more
towards that kind of cream type
highlight this one the reason I finally
bit the bullet is I heard someone say I
can't remember who but I heard someone
say this when you put it on top a
foundation does not move your foundation
and I was like sold because I feel like
a lot of the cream highlights I've tried
when I'll put it on I'm like and it just
kind of makes it look a little less
perfected there because it smoothes the
foundation out of the way to place the
highlight down this doesn't so today for
example I put it on top of powder and it
still looks really really nice now this
is not all I'm wearing in all fairness
another I'm wearing another highlight
with it so I know that like kind of
defeats the purpose it's like a you
can't tell but I just I love this so
much I was like I just won't put it on
here's what it did for me the powder
highlight I have on I'll go ahead and
mention it because it's the next product
I was gonna talk about it's the Anasazi
I am honest Asya a more easy highlight
that everyone's raving about this it's
amazing for every skin tone it is a
beautiful highlighter you can't doubt I
mean like it's it's gorgeous it does
work if you've got paler skin and that
was my concern but a lot of you guys are
like no no I've got a fair skin it
totally works I feel like this isn't it
looks really pretty on my skin so I have
that on my skin today but for me I've
realized I have to apply this before I
apply blush because when I apply this
like let's say I did bronzer and blush
and then I was going to highlight it
just doesn't end up looking as natural
as I want I mean this is not a highly
that's gonna look natural I'm aware of
that but I wanted to at least look a
little more seamless and I felt that I
couldn't get the seamless look that way
so what I've started doing with this is
I'll put on maybe my bronzer then I'll
put on the highlight then I'll put on
the blush kind of on top of it so then
it looks like it it's more fused
together and maybe diffuse is the better
word it's more diffused it's not a stark
of a line no matter what brush I've used
with it because it is so pigmented so
for me that's been working and frankly
I'm like Leslie that's something I feel
like I should do with any highlighter
because then it just it helps avoid that
strip of highlight that a lot of us end
up having without really meaning to so I
do like this highlight a lot do I think
you need to run out and get it if you
already have a lot of nice blinding
highlights I don't think it's anything
more special than that but I do think
it's pretty so I don't regret owning it
I will certainly use it like crazy but I
don't think it's like ten thousand
leagues above other highlights I already
like does that make sense
but with this what I did is so I told
you I put that hat on and then I put
this on with my sponge I just tapped it
on there and just tapped it in place and
I feel like again it kind of helped
defuse the whole area make it look a
little bit more natural even though
obviously it's a highlighter so I've
been enjoying those together but also
separate I don't think you have to use
these together obviously if I were to
pick one of the two like if I had only
bought one now knowing what
No I would have bought the hourglass
because I think it's a little bit more
unique
I mean comparatively and I just I was so
impressed with how long it stayed on and
how beautiful it looked on the skin a
product that I feel kind of wishy-washy
about I'm wearing it today
it's the Anastacio bronzer now I picked
out the shade rosewood these are very
reddish toned bronzers which can be very
like it's truly from the Sun you know
that's the kind of look I just realized
I don't think I liked that look on me
and I think I knew that about myself
and I should have really thought twice
about this but I thought well I'm buying
a highlighter I want to try the bronzer
out again I feel like when I have
applied it it's why I really does swatch
beautifully and really bronzers are hard
to get to swatch pretty ly prettily it's
hard to get bronzers to swatch well but
that doesn't matter if I don't like the
way it looks on my skin cuz I I could
love us watch all day long but that
might not be outlooks on my face cuz I'm
not taking my finger and putting it on
that way so I've tried it with a couple
of different brushes and I just feel
like like you can see how my skin today
I just feel like it's soso and again for
that reason for the price tag I'm like
please I could get one from the
drugstore that does the exact same thing
like this kind of reminds me of the NYC
sunny bronzer this is smoother than that
but even just tome wise it reminds me
that remember that bronzer so for that
reason I just again knowing what I know
what I have bought this no nothing it's
bad but it's not great and that's what
I'm looking for greatness I'm going to
keep trying it of course I'm not just
gonna give up that quickly because I've
only been using these for about a week
this really is more of a first
impressions than anything kind of my
initial thoughts but I will do a haul
update and let you guys know how I'm
liking this stuff
okay I gotta move quicker because I've
only talked about four products and we
are pretty far into this video okay okay
so what I'm wearing on my lips today
might be my new favorite summer lip
product period a slash travel at product
/ purse lip product / daily life lip
product this is from myself so it's
expensive however I thought to myself
you know what if I'm using this all the
time then it's worth the money because
I'm enjoying it but if it's something
I'm spending this much money on an
interesting
dror then it's definitely not worth the
money but this is the YSL Vil upped
liquid color bomb I have it in the shade
I think it's number 12 and I have it on
my lips today it's more of a clearer it
reminds me of those Vil upped shine is
that what they have I feel like it's
honestly guys I think it's the same
product
I really do I don't even know if why I
sell still makes those but then L'Oreal
had made a really similar dupe that if
they still make them I will link it
below because they are very very similar
but this smells amazing it smells like
fruit the color is so pretty and it just
kind of melts into your lips it feels so
soft it's not a gloss it certainly has a
little bit of a glossy tint
that's not glossy Sheen but it's not
sticky it's not thick like it says
really weirdly thin comfortable
moisturizing product and that's why I
said it's like the perfect daily life
lip product you don't need a lip liner
you honestly hardly need a mirror I mean
you might want to mirror but I just I'm
really enjoying this I would I buy
another shade like a deeper shade I
don't know that I would want that
because if I want a red I probably want
a more defined red unless I'm going for
like that and juicy
like like juicy strawberry lip kind of
look I don't know but this shade in
particular I'm really really liking and
it's just so darn comfortable and of
course the packaging is so pretty I know
a bunch of people got these like the
whole set and PR I didn't and I just
bought it because I wanted it the
lipstick I've been wearing in a few
recent videos that people have asked is
actually in that get ready with me which
I'll link below is the Kat Von D studded
kiss cream lipstick I'm sure I read that
the wrong no I read that right it's in
the shade Lovecraft and these are so
creamy oh my gosh they're pretty
comfortable I think they're not as super
moisturizing lipstick but they're not
super drying either so it's kind of a
standard when it comes to how your lips
feel when you wear lipstick kind of
subpar but I don't mind that cuz I know
when I'm wearing a lipstick it's not
gonna be the most moisturizing thing but
of course it's not nearly as trying it's
like a liquid matte lipstick which I
think a lot of us have moved away from
so if you're wanting kind of that more
stay-put type of quality but you don't
want to use the super drying liquid
matte lipsticks try this because this
really does stay in place I still used a
lip liner with it
I just always do with lipstick but I
don't think that you need to this really
does stay in place
and I love this color Lovecraft there's
so many shades it was hard to pick one
but this it does you know it's a little
deeper than I think I thought it would
be but I still really like it so if you
want to see it on my lips I will link
that you're ready with meaning you'll
get to see it there um what I'm wearing
on my lower lash line you probably can't
tell is this markup Jacobs
oh wait slow down Jess Marc Jacobs
highlighter gel eye crayon I thought it
I was gonna get in black and I was like
Jessica if you buy one more black eye
liner you're dead to me
because I have so many black eyeliners
and I do use black I learn every single
day so it's not that it wouldn't get
used from like you do not need a
high-end black liner because there are
so many drugstore ones that are really
good like my L'Oreal infallible black
pencil liner I'll link that below that's
what I'm wearing today I freaking love
it it is so good and so cheap but I did
want to try a colored one cuz I don't
use a lot of colored liner and I've
heard so many good things about the High
Line or yeah high liner anyway I got it
in this blue shade does it actually have
a oh it's in the shade think anyway it's
it's definitely a deep like kind of navy
blue but it's a really pretty shift to
it and I feel like on my lower lash line
you can't tell but when you get really
really close I think it makes my brown
eyes look a little bit just kind of cool
the same way that like a navy mascara
would do the same thing I think that's
so nice and so I haven't tried it on my
upper lash line yet I might try that
this week just to see you know how does
it say but it stays really well on the
lower lash line now I don't have it in
the waterline I don't do that that often
I think it kind of closes my eyes off so
I do sometimes but I don't do it all the
time so verdict on that is that it's
really nice it's really creamy it stays
in place really well do I think you have
to spend this kind of money on an
expensive liner no like I said the
L'Oreal ones I mentioned
are amazing and they have different
shades to another product I bought and I
haven't used so I have to tell you in
the update how I like it is the Sephora
Pro airbrush number 55 brush I was
reading the reviews on this and my job
is on the floor people were like this is
the best look I've ever had by applying
my foundation with a brush and I'm kind
of in this rut where I only it's not
really a rough I just love my L'Oreal
pink sponge and when you find one of
those sponges that you love whether it's
the Beauty Blender for you or the Real
Techniques we all have our own that we
just love and I'm like nothing else
applies anything better than that sponge
it just doesn't and every time I try
something different
so I felt like I was in a rut and I
didn't have a foundation brush that I
really really loved and sometimes that's
quicker than going and wetting your
sponge and do not so I bought this and
then I forgot that I bought it and I
haven't tried it yet so I am excited to
try it and other people were saying of
course it's really nice for other things
you could use it for bronzer powder
whatever you want but it's super soft
this was expensive sometimes when I
think Sephora collection like oh it's
not gonna be that expensive and then it
is and I'm like what alright moving on
to the stuff that I'm like weirdly even
more excited about okay I finally bit
the bullet and I know some of you guys
trying to kill me cuz you're like
Jessica I told you about dupes for that
but I was like I don't care I want to
try the real thing
it's the sk2 essence I know don't kill
me but here's the thing I thought okay
if I try an sk2 essence do I need to
know what the original is like too so I
figure well Jessica girl you're put to
have a baby that's gonna be a lot of
pain I think you deserve to treat
yourself so I treated myself and I got
the SK - this is the Pitera essence set
I realized it was the same price like
dead-on the same price to get this set
versus just getting the essence in the
exact same size so it comes with comes
with the essence it's their facial
treatment essence it's a cult favorite
people freaking swear by this stuff but
it's so expensive anyway it comes with I
think this is what two and a half fluid
ounces and whatever the price of this
was which of course I always have the
prices in my description box the price
of this
was the same as the price of this set
with these three things so I was like
well I might as well try some other
products so came with a facial treatment
mask I think it's a sheet mask and then
it also came with this much much smaller
facial treatment clear lotion so it says
it's purifying and this is one fluid
ounce so I figure you know what I am so
excited to try this now you guys have
told me some really good news that once
I've tried this and I actually know like
okay what does this do to my skin then
when I try those dupes I can let you
know like okay actually yeah this is
totally the same thing or no it's
different whatever but I am so excited
to try this I'm using up I'm gonna be
very good I'm not gonna open this until
I use up I'm using up a co2 Lee essence
that I actually really do like I'm
curious if they're dupes - but of course
co2 Lee is still like 40 bucks or never
so it's still expensive anyway to use
those I bought more of my Shiseido
facial Cotton's I know trust me I roll
my eyes every time I youtubers like and
then my should say her facial cotton so
I always stock aha but then I tried them
and I was like okay well I get it I get
it I get it
even though it annoys me and I would
roll my eyes because everyone's like
just had a facial Cotton's I'm telling
you ladies and gentlemen if you've not
tried them oh my gosh they're so soft
and it's it's not that they're so soft
that's a bonus it's the fact that when I
put like an essence on it because that's
what I really that's pretty much all I
use it for it doesn't like it doesn't
soak the whole essence up so like when
I've and I've tried them like one night
I try this and when I try just you know
regular cotton rounds from Target
anywhere the regular like cotton rounds
I would put it on there and then I'd go
to wipe the essence lightly all over my
face and it would just like there'd be
nothing there and I'd have to put more
on or get another cotton around with
these I put the same amount and it's
just like that liquid is flying all over
my face it doesn't soak it all up I
don't know why I don't know how but I
know something static man
did anyone else thing little we're in
there it does now oh boy guys anyway I
love these now the reality is this was a
15 percent off sale that I was doing I
saved a dollar 50 on each it's not great
but I figure well - well stock up now
honestly these will last me forever I
won't need to buy them probably until
like Christmas maybe even later than
that anyway I'll get off of that
but I'm telling you they're nice all
right
oh my gosh so this I know I don't even
know that it's new so I can't even say
it it's new to me the glow recipe brands
that like suddenly is popping up
everywhere this is their watermelon glow
sleeping mask I have this sick obsession
with sleeping masks because the idea is
I mean come on this is genius it's
something that you put on your skin and
it's more masks like and you sleep with
it on your it's not getting all over
your pillow because you're putting it on
as if it's like a moisturizer or serum
whatever and so it's sinking into your
skin overnight often times you either
just leave it on or you can rinse it off
in the morning but usually you don't
need to cuz it's just sunk into your
skin I love the idea of that I love it
so I'm always anytime I see sleeping
masks I'm like what's in it what does it
do what what are the main ingredients so
this is their watermelon glow sleeping
mask and it says it's glowing radiance
and softening I obviously have not
opened this yet brand-new I've been
using the lineage sleeping water
sleeping mask and I have like a tiny
trial it is really nice uh-huh it's
really nice but I you know trying to
branch out and try more but that I
haven't bought the full-size of yet I'm
thinking about it but I figure well let
me try this one next so anyway it's I
mean come on the packaging is so pretty
they know what they're doing oh my gosh
it definitely smells like watermelon
which fragrance and skincare like I've
talked about it technically shouldn't be
there because fragrance can be irritants
for different skin types but then there
are those other times that when you're
putting it on your like and you just
love it it's like it's worth it I don't
know so I'm always kind of contradictory
in that because I'm like really don't
need it but at the same time sometimes
if it's a smell you love you're like
anyway so this is a haz has hyaluronic
acid that's usually when I'm sold the
second I see hyaluronic acid I'm like my
skin loves it it's so moisturizing so
I'm excited to try this out that's all
and it come
it's a little spatula which is good cuz
it's in a jar so it's not great thank
you
alright let's keep going Oh another I've
gotta stop I clearly am going through a
skincare thing and you know I'm 29 I'll
be 30 next year I'm having a baby
like there's a lot that's affecting my
skin right now and so I think for that
reason that's why I'm so skincare minded
and I think a lot of people go through
that shift which is a good shift I mean
it's it's great to be thinking about
your skin and taking care of it so this
is from herbivore and it's their moon
fruit nightly treatment super fruit
night treatment so it comes with a
little spatula again again they know
what these companies know what they're
doing to us with their packaging just
like so simplistic in the color and so I
just does it have a smell it no it has
just the kind of skin care smell if you
know what I mean it's not a sweet smell
by any means so it's probably more
natural but it's like a thicker kind of
looks like a moisturizer now let's read
how you apply this cuz herbivores
another one of those brands that's very
new to me and I feel like it's popping
up everywhere so it says it's an
otherworldly multitasking night
treatment that feeds skin with super
fruits gently resurfaces with fruit
enzymes and hydrates deeply with a blend
of exotic butters and hyaluronic acid
all while you sleep so it says before
going to sleep apply generously to clean
skin make sure it absorbs completely
into your skin and if you use it during
the day avoid direct sunlight use high
SPF because there are Ajay's present so
it sounds like these are like pretty
much the same product when it comes to
what they're supposed to do for your
skin in a way they both have a chase
they both of hyaluronic acid just and
I'm sure but I'm sure there are other
different ingredients so as I explore
deeper I'm excited to try all these out
and then give you an update because
until I've tried I'm it's hard it's hard
to say but I just want to share it
because I'm so excited to share those
new goodies that I'm trying when I
record or I asked in a recent video
about hair oils because I talked about
all of my hair favorites and I can link
that below like my favorite hair
products both for when I wear naturally
curly ish wavy and then also when I wear
it you know just kind of blow-dried
straight blowouts things like that like
Holy Grail products
I love so many them but I really haven't
found a hair oil I felt that strongly
about so a lot of you guys recommended
the verb ghost oil so I bought it cuz it
wasn't that expensive I want to say it
was under 20 bucks which I mean I guess
that's kind of expensive but honestly
drugstore hair oils a lot of them are
like $11 $12 so when you start comparing
it's like well if this is that much
better maybe it's worth spending eight
dollars more maybe this was even around
15 regardless its gots it says smoothing
moringa blend and weightless hair oil
and I've only used it once and I really
liked it but I'm like well was it the
shampoo I was using you know so I've got
to keep doing my scientific experiments
with this and keep trying it but I I was
surprised at how lightweight literally
the bottle was it's as if the hair oils
really lightweight which is awesome
because if you're used to all weighing
your hair down it feels as though this
is kind of moisturizing but it's not
weighing it down so digging that so far
I will continue to update you on that
then I've got the bumble and bumble bee
bee thickening dry spun finish this is a
dry spray basically a texturizing spray
I had a sample of this and I was like
salivating I was like this is really
nice and Bumble and Bumble like you know
they're so expensive and like with hair
I feel like I go through hair care so
quickly so I'm always like hesitant to
spend the money but then like but it's
worth it Jess if it really makes the
difference in your hair
I love texturizing spray both for when
my hair's like this but also just like
when it's if I curl it with like a
curling wand and it's second day hair
and I've kind of dry shampoo too a
little bit and I'm like my hair just
looks kind of limp texturizing spray is
it because hairspray sometimes can be
sticky texture isn't you spray is more
not even clay like it's more to like a
powder finish but it just holds
everything together without being sticky
and you can just kind of mold it and
it's just like makes your hair smell
good all of the above I feel like it's
one of those like supermodel tricks you
know what I'm saying like that
supermodel hair always texturizing spray
so I do know I like this I'm excited to
have a full size and then I bought this
living proof blowout styling and
finishing spray so it's basically a heat
protectant I have been
gently now I'm sure once I have this kid
I'm gonna have no time and my hair will
be like this cuz that's what it does
when it air drives I mean I put products
in it and energy anyway but this is I
love the idea of spraying to start my
hair before I'm even blow-drying it in
all of that to give it that extra heat
protectant and to help keep it straight
versus going to curly I'm excited to
give it a try I feel like I am terrible
about using heat protectant which is why
I hardly ever heat style my hair because
I'm like ah like I I don't know and I
know it's so bad for here so I need to
be better about so this is me trying I'm
also the free or maybe this was the 100
per maybe 250 I don't know it was a
certain oh no this is the birthday gift
that's what it was so I didn't pick out
any perks I don't think because I none
of them really like stood out to me as
like ooh this time around but this is
the birthday gift and you can choose and
I chose this hair one and it's Bumble
and Bumble it's their hairdressers
invisible oil shampoo and conditioner
and I was like it sounds pretty nice you
know put this in my hospital bag I what
did I end up putting in there oh I might
have put a living proof one and I love
living proof hair products so maybe I
have a shampoo and conditioner trial
size of living proof in my hospital bag
which I will film what's in my hospital
bag if you're curious anyway so I
figured honestly we travel enough and we
already have some travel plan even with
the baby so I'm like you know I - we'll
stock up on really good travel sized
shampoo conditioners cuz for me here's
an example and I know a lot of you guys
like Garnier Fructis and I do have
products there's I like but like Garnier
Fructis most of their shampoos and
conditioners totally dry my hair out and
then there's some like the Garnier whole
blend so I'm like a no but these are
better so it's so hit or miss for me but
like the ones that are liking the green
tubes always dry my hair out so when
I've travelled with travel size of those
in the past cuz they're they're always
in the store they're easy to grab and
they're semi inexpensive I'm never like
the entire trip I'm like oh my hair so
dried and frizzy and it's and so I've
really tried to be better about you know
collect really nice shampoo and
conditioners for travel that way when
you're traveling
a it feels like a really nice kind of
spa-like experience but also your hair
looks nice while you're traveling you're
taking photos and like for us we vlog as
well and like what my hair - were crazy
so anywho so that is everything I bought
I think I feel like I've probably been
trying stuff into my collection I like
oh yeah I forgot oh one more thing I
want to mention some of these products
are so pretty I literally just want to
take an Instagram pro might do it just
take an Instagram photo of them be like
just look at these pretty products dumb
I think I might do it if I do I'll put
it on plummet screen that I actually did
it because sometimes like I just like
look at products on Instagram and I'm
like these are so pretty
anyway this is also from herbivore I
just figured I'd mention it I didn't buy
this this was from octa Lee so I picked
it out on there and they sent it to me
for free to try it's their orchid facial
oil and what did they say this was good
for they have a couple I want to try all
of them again I only have one face but
it says it contains lush exotic floral
oils that give skin a bright new glow
while gently preserving its youth
formulated for normal to dry skin that's
why it was I think this was for normal
to dry skin in need of hydration and
protection against premature aging aging
so you apply like 5 to 10 drops of this
morning and night it says I could see
myself using this both morning and night
but I could really see myself using it
as a facial oil in the morning before
putting on makeup it says to let it
absorb for like 1 to 3 minutes and then
you can apply your makeup and I love
facial oils I feel like it's helped to
give me the glow that I've always wanted
and a lot of you guys are like girl
pregnancy glow I'm like nope girl I'm
pretty sure two spatial oils because I
have really been a stickler to using
them and so what I'll do in the morning
is I'll put on a facial oil and then you
know I'll wait I'll maybe put on some
lip balm I'll maybe even sometimes I'll
even put on eye cream kind of just on
top of it and I'll get a video to type
out what my brush is while that oils
sinking in I just feel like everything
looks better on my skin period
throughout the day and I know that some
people are like oil though how does that
work I'm telling you it works I don't
know and I was such a it's still such a
new world to me and I'm so obsessed so
very excited to give us a try I just
figured out
mention it since I talked about so much
skincare and that's another one that's
new to me all right so I know this video
is so ridiculously long I hope you
enjoyed it I hope you'll subscribe and
hit the notification bell before you
leave so you are notified sorry when I
upload new videos and other than that I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
