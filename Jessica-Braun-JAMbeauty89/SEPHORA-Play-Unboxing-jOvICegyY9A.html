realizing I just took a big ol swig of
some hot cocoa and I was like if you
liked it like instantly you lose your
teeth anyway my hubby made me some hot
cocoa and it's like hitting the spot and
I don't know if you for you guys like I
grew up drinking hot cocoa with water
and so it was good but like he makes it
with milk and like my whole brain
exploded because it is so much better
with milk but we just always used water
I don't know anyway okay so today I'm
gonna for the first time on my channel
unbox the Sephora play box it's $10 a
month I haven't done subscription box
unboxings in a very long time I still
get I think I rejoined Birchbox did I
end up canceling it again I don't know I
keep going back and forth and I like
that's one that I pay for and then like
if see I think I paid for and then I
cancelled
maybe I don't remember what I was
getting for free and what I was paying
for but anyway in the end I ended up
canceling a lot of them cuz I was like
these are products I'm not using I feel
guilty
anyway but this is one that I recently
joined just because I was curious now
I've got two other months but this is
the first month I haven't looked inside
to see what's in it but I thought you
know what I'm gonna share with you guys
it'll just be a quick video so the
Sephora play box are played by Sephora
is ten dollars a month they say it
includes five deluxe samples and a
fragrance like a small little fragrance
and there's like usually a cute little
bag that you can keep the bags are
different than like itse bags are almost
always that same size these are
different like usually a little like
slow down
drawstring bags so anyway first thing
I'm seeing is this little flyer and it
says 50 Beauty and center points for
October 2017 I think the way this works
and I actually haven't redeemed it isn't
that terrible but I think you can like
if you buy a full-size of something that
you can actually get this let me see
this yeah it's a Oh on this one it says
didn't get an exact match go grab your
perfect Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation at your local Sephora show
your play pass so I presume that's this
and get a personalized one-on-one calls
a consultation I'm sure they would give
you that consultation regardless but
anyway okay so it's this public display
of complexion
funny yeah so it always has like the
little drawstring it's kind of cute I
don't know I haven't utilized the other
two months yet so we'll see oh I'm
seeing some good brands though Urban
Decay is the first thing in here it's
their optical illusion complexion primer
I have not tried this I don't I know
that all their new primers they came out
with I haven't heard like I've heard
mixed things I've tried their urban
defense let me grab it yeah I tried
their urban defense complexion primer
there was like a week or two where I was
like only using this every single day I
really like it it has SPF of 30 it
glides right on so this one I was really
impressed with it held onto foundation
really really well but I know that some
people were kind of hit or miss with
some of these so this one is their
complexion primer it's smoothing it has
rosehip and argan oil and it says it's
perfecting this is adorable
let's see what it looks like it looks
like it's yeah it's got like a pink
light pink hue to it ooh very looks
lotion life but it kind of smoothes out
and feels more of like I'm going to
metha cone smooth feel like velvet it
doesn't have a noticeable smell I mean
it feels like a baby's bottom
holy moly so I'll have to try it I mean
it's kind of the same feel that this one
has but this one has SPF of 30
I don't really know too I mean I guess
it looks a little bit brighter yeah I
guess it really does
I don't know so I'll have to let you
guys know how this how this goes yeah so
they have four in the line there's urban
defense I just showed you they have
their D slick one that's mattifying they
have a self-adjusting one that adjusts
to your skin tone those always make me
nervous
um anyway alright next thing this must
be the fragrance sample it's Tory Burch
Bell as your as your hazard I don't know
um I'm just gonna spray it smells very
fresh I never know like I'm sure people
they're like fragrance junkies are like
no don't do that it's the dumbest way I
don't know I just sprayed oh it smells
very perfume me
it smells nice what I want a full-size
of this I don't think so but it smells
like almost citrusy of course it doesn't
have the notes anywhere you see
citronella on here anyway
it does it smells very citrusy and fresh
it reminds me of one of my sisters
she'd like this but these are great to
travel with I will say when I find a
fragrance I like I love traveling with
this because it's so tiny it takes up no
room in my liquids bag which is awesome
so I'll give this a try that I might
save it for spring it smells more
spring-like okay next in the bag
so I don't think that one counts as one
of the five items by the way oh this is
the Tarte rainforest of the sea marine
boosting mist okay again these are
adorable little like ooh alright should
we just risk it and just threw it on I'm
nervous oh it has a smell I like it I
know some people if you're sensitive to
smell this definitely is a smell but the
mister is really nice which is rare for
a sample site you know what I mean like
that's really cool that they actually
like put some care into it because
that's like 50% of the battle with
sanitary mmm 70% of the battle with
setting sprays is how is the mister but
that one on really evenly I don't know
if it really did anything to my skin but
it feels nice feels refreshing it smells
really good hmm alright next up in here
is oh it's from makeup forever so that
was kind of a hint we have at that car
oh this is different it's a skin booster
serum awesome because I was gonna say I
already have the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD like foundation but this is a serum
again it this is like a legitimate glass
bottle I hate to like waste serum so I'm
just gonna get a little bit it's kind of
a mostly clear serum
no snow smell at all it glides right on
it feels like a serum that's really thin
which is nice when you do it before
makeup because if you have a really
thick oily can not concealer if you have
a really thick oily serum you can't put
it on before makeup application because
it completely affects the way it looks
whereas this I mean this is almost
already blended into my skin and dry so
that's the ideal kind of a serum for pre
makeup application so I'm excited to try
that tomorrow morning okay next up oh
here is the foundation makeup for ever
ultra HD why 245 actually what shade do
I already wear I've been wearing why 225
which I don't know that it's a perfect
match I think it's still a little dark
for me but
been working so this will be a little
dark but I can kind of show you the
swatches side by side it's I feel like
when they redid this foundation it's
actually no y 225 really is good it's a
lot more this is too like washed out I
feel like but I'll show you up close the
Y 245 is a lot darker a little more
yellow tone a little more warm toned but
I feel like when they redid the formula
this foundation I still stand by the
fact that I liked the foundations
formula before it's not that it's bad
now and I still use it and I still
really like it it's kind of grown on me
more and more over the past year too but
I do miss the old formula I just feel
like it looked less obvious on the skin
it was even more photographic I mean
these are great there's no flashback but
it's a good it's a good foundation I
just missed the whole formula alright
and last up in here is from dr. Brandt
it's there dr. Brandt pore dermabrasion
pore perfecting exfoliator I feel like I
always get in different things like
little dr. Brandt little things huh it
says dampen skin with water slowly and
gently massage cream for one minute
avoiding the eyes allow one to two
minutes to activate and deep clean pores
rinse well pat dry use one or two times
a week allowing three days between so
I'm always interested in these I feel
like this is I mean it's kind of a
surface exfoliator at least as far as it
sounds and I don't know how well these
work just generally but especially on my
skin as well but I'm down to try
especially something small I know that
sometimes let's see sometimes things
with little microbeads not like the bead
beads that are like outlawed but the
little tiny micro ones that are like
almost like sand those can cause of
little micro tears in your skin that can
you know make your redness appear worse
and things like that so I'm always
cautious but let's just see yeah this
has like tiny finely milled like almost
sand like feel to it so I feel like if
you're careful with it like they said if
you don't do it too much I don't think
there's any harm you kind of got to know
your skin though so I probably will give
this a try so all in all you're getting
a
primer and a foundation a mist and a
serum so you can use all these together
and you're getting the little micro
dermabrasion so this is like a really
nice like skin care snot skin care but
just like face set and of course with
their theme being public display of
complexion it makes sense I think it's
cool that there are themes where you
know I don't know I feel like other
boxes in the past that I've gotten can
be all over the place not that that's a
bad thing because you're trying all
kinds of different things but you'd get
a nail polish and a lipstick you know
but it's kind of cool that you know you
can actually use all of these together
for the month and hopefully make your
skin really really nice and I don't know
I think that's a cool idea so for ten
dollars a month I think it's awesome to
know I think the reason I was so
intrigued by this box all along was
because they're all brands that are sold
at Sephora they're not random brands
that could be really bad I would say not
everything sold as suppor is amazing
obviously that's why their channels like
mine where we're reviewing things and
trying things letting you know what's
great what's not but I think there's
more of a chance whereas if it's random
brands some startup companies are
incredible they have amazing products
and some aren't and so I feel like with
random brands being parts of it it can
be a great thing but it can also be a
bad thing because it's just a gamble so
I like the idea of this and I'm really
honestly excited about all these I was
very surprised like I said I'm paying
for this on my own
there's I'm always being honest with you
but I know for some people you like
hearing that
we'll see what month next month brings
if you'd like me to open this each month
on my channel please let me know just
give this video a thumbs up let me know
in the comments I backed away from
subscription boxes for a reason I feel
like it was getting redundant and
everyone was already doing them so I
figure you know why should I do them if
you've got a million people you can
watch there's not really a reason but I
still like them so let me know down
below like I said I hope that you'll
subscribe if you enjoyed and I will see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
