my Sephora play unboxing this is a
monthly subscription box um
I buy it through sephora's website so
like if you have a Sephora just regular
account where you log in it'll just show
is like an order on your account which I
always think it's kind of interesting
cuz I like the other day I was looking
at my past support orders and I saw an
order for like you know maybe the week
before and I was like what I didn't
order anything so I clicked on I'm all
nervous like someone's on my account
ordering so so I click on it and then I
see oh no it's just the monthly about
the monthly subscription kind of showing
up on there
so it's ten dollars a month which is
pretty standard for you know sample size
subscription boxes like Birchbox if see
those are all $10 a month but what I
love about this which I say in every
video that I do this end is that it's
all stuff available at Sephora and a lot
of times it's newer products so it's a
great way if you are a youtuber or
blogger to find out about new makeup or
if you just love makeup and you want to
know about what's new out there I think
that's cool a lot of the experiences
I've had with like Birchbox and Ipsy I
had fall in love with the product he was
the perfect example there was this lip
product called the Hanalei lip treatment
it was my favorite I tried it it was in
one of those subscription boxes and it
was awesome I fell in love with it but
then when I went to buy it I either had
to buy it through the Ipsy site but I
liked it
redirected me so I had to buy it on the
handle a website from Hawaii and so it
was an amazing product amazing discovery
but I was like it's so inconvenient to
order it whereas with support at least
you know if you wanted to buy the full
size you know it sold it for us so I
know that's me being kind of picky but
it is what it is and it is one of the
reasons I've kept this subscription in
fact it's the only subscription I still
get I think that's it fun anyway but so
it always comes with 50 Beauty Insider
points that you can have in your account
which i think is cool and just like fun
little things so this is all about
here's to a beautiful 2018 and it just
gives different things like masks more
practice self-care eat green things like
that
so this is it says 2018 Happy New Year
so they always come with little like
pouches like this they're useful if you
lie
like some people talked about how they
would store things in it when they
travel or they just store like little
perfume samples there's a lot of things
you can make little gift baskets out of
them for people if you wanted or little
gift bags I should say so first thing I
see in here is something I actually own
and I love this this is the Smashbox
photo finish primer Iser so why I like
this primer oh my gosh that is like
really truly tiny though it's a very
moisturizing primer it has hyaluronic
acid in it which is a great moisturizing
agent for your skin but it's still a
primer it still does a good job of
holding onto your foundation I know a
lot of you guys have bought this primer
from my recommendation I really do I
really do like it so it's just kind of a
looks like a moisturizer almost but a
little bit more gel like and if it kind
of feels like a moisturizer when you're
putting it on but it like I said it does
it is a little bit more of a gel
moisturizer but sinks into your skin
holds onto that moisture throughout the
day but it also holds on to your makeup
which is the whole point so that is
awesome and if you'd never tried it that
would be a great way to discover that
next product is this bozhe exfoliating
peel gel how do you use this I'm so
curious cuz I haven't blown the back yes
okay so on the back of the little poster
it gives info about the products like
how to use etc so this let's read about
it's a gel peel that exfoliates gently
using a chase and removes impurities for
bright soft skin it's the best remedy
for skin that's feeling a little blue
this antioxidant rich blend of fruit
enzymes revitalizes a dull complexion to
reveal radiant skin but it's not too
harsh so you apply it to dry clean skin
massage in circular motions all over the
face for a few minutes so then after a
few minutes you rinse it with warm water
so it's not something that you like put
on and peel off like that it's more of a
deeper exfoliating I'm curious about
like does it have little microbeads or
not usually when it's a chemical peel
like with a Jace it usually doesn't have
that cuz the kind of little microbeads
not microbeads because I'm pretty sure
those are outlawed in most places but
the little tiny
particles in it usually are for more of
a physical exfoliation which I don't
feel like my skin really needs too much
of so I finally opened it took way too
long to open I want to see like what
kind of a yeah so it's just like a clear
gel oh no there are little particles in
there you can feel it unless it's just
pulling up the dry skin on my hand oh my
gosh if it is doing that that is I think
it is oh my gosh it's literally peeling
up the dry skin on my hands this is
crazy so it itself does not have
anything it's oh my gosh okay so I am
pumped to try this
it's literally getting the dry skin off
my hands and I did have some so now I
you I'm you will definitely want to
follow this with the really good
moisturizer that's why they say to rub
it in holy moly I can't wait to try this
on my face okay you need to know that I
just did it on my feet and my feet feel
really smooth I'm not so on my feet but
I literally was like I wonder if it'll
work on my feet all right so really
pumped about this if this does work that
well I might I could see myself buying
the full size of this that is so cool
all right Wow next thing in here is from
glam glow it's they're super cleanse
clearing cream to foam cleanser and so
it's a nope it nope nope nope wrong
reading the wrong thing ultra creamy
cleanser uses a blend of three charcoals
to clear pores and remove oil and makeup
it's a powerful yet gentle cream to foam
cleanser it removes every trace of
makeup while maintaining moisture so you
put it in your hands you add water to it
and then rub your hands together get a
lather put it on your face and then you
rinse it clean so it's not one that you
like leave on it really is truly a wash
off cleanser but I will definitely give
that a try I always hear mixed things
about glam glow because some people are
like you know what glam glow is really
gimmicky and it's not you know it might
appear that it's doing much but it's
really not and then there are other
people that absolutely love it and swear
by it so I'm kind of somewhere in the
middle
tried little bits and I'm like I think I
like it you know you never know if
you're just in your head because
everyone else likes it or if it's
actually working so I will definitely
give this a try let you guys know next
thing is another thing I've tried I had
the full size up its the Clinique pep
start eye cream so it's hydrating a
brightening under-eye cream
easy to pop in your bag for pick-me-ups
throughout the day say goodbye to tired
eyes it's powered by peptides keep you
looking refreshed no matter how little
sleep you get using a circular motion
apply a small amount directly to your
under eye area in the morning or as
needed throughout the day I use this in
the morning I just a lot of people again
this is like a holy girl for some people
were you guys gonna tell me this was
open um it's like a holy girl for some
people I just liked it I just felt like
it was just kind of standard though you
know what I mean I liked it would I buy
the full size no will I use this
probably I mean I'll throw in my travel
drawer maybe and just use it on a trip
or two and then be done with it because
there's not this isn't even full you can
see through it and it's like half full
um I did like it but I just didn't feel
like it was anything special like it
didn't have a cooling effect around my
hole it really feels like it's doing
something and I never really saw that it
was doing anything either
next thing is from uh Nastasia it's
their lip gloss in Kristen I have tried
now they're matte wow that is a
pigmented gloss but it's not a matte
liquid liquid cuz I'm getting tired of
those of course I'm wearing one as we
speak um but it's an opaque high pigment
lip gloss in a desert sand shade for
shiny lacquer lips mm-hmm yeah that's I
mean it's pretty self-explanatory let's
just put some on let's just see how does
it look that's like the exact same shade
has a slight scent mmm it's like a sweet
scent though
that's very slight though uh I like it I
mean it's not super sticky it's not
crazy shiny but it's a nice amount of
shine and the color is like exactly up
my alley it's not so dark that it makes
you look like you're vampy that day but
it's not so light that it washes you out
it's just right in between so really
digging that I'm finding that it's I'm
really struggling because a lot of nudes
that I try are either way too dark on me
or they're so light that it just doesn't
work with me
with my pigmented lips that is a shade
that totally works so I could see I mean
I really don't need any more lip gloss
but I could see myself buying a
full-size of this especially in this
shade since it's such a nice shade for
me the last thing in here is a treatment
mask from way which is a really popular
haircare brand right now I've tried a
lot of their stuff I've got their wave
spray I've tried a lot of people love
that it makes make her a little crunchy
which I don't love my hair is naturally
textured though so I don't really need a
lot of help with that you know what I
mean
but maybe you feel like stick straight
hair I could see that maybe working but
I've tried their shampoo and conditioner
and it's pretty nice and then what else
am I trying right now it's like they're
not they're texture spray but it's
something like that and the smell is
like way too strong I can't see it but
it says it's a moisturizing hair
treatment to protect and repair damaged
hair deeply hydrating hair mass uses
artichoke leaf extract tamarind seed
extract keratin and amino acids to
deliver moisture and seal cuticles in
order to prevent future damage so you
put it in dry or wet hair wait five to
ten minutes and then rinse it out so
that's interesting so you could put it
in your dry hair before you shower right
I mean is that the idea cuz you'd have
to rinse it out that's an interesting
thought so I would assume it's supposed
to be one use you never know sometimes
you can get more although my hair is
pretty long I probably be one use
usually it'll come with like a perfume
sample so I don't know if this is meant
to like replace that since it's such a
it's a much smaller sample than like
these more deluxe size but either way
that's pretty cool so that was
everything for this month I think the
thing I mean the most excited about
would have to be the exfoliating peel
peel gel from Boscia or basta whatever
that sounds awesome
I'm really excited about this lipgloss
of course like I said the primer Iser
from Smashbox is amazing and then I'm
intrigued to try this glam glow thing
and the way mask and like I said the pep
starts in okay product there's nothing
wrong with it I just don't feel like
it's like worth the higher price tag
that clinic has so if you would like to
see last month's unboxing just so you
can get an idea of the kinds of things
you can get in these kinds of boxes I
will link last month's unboxing below

enjoy it and I'll see you guys in my
