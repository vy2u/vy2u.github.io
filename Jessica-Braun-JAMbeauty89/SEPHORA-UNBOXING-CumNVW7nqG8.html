over today we're doing a Sephora
unboxing and I am pumped all right so
support slow down Jess you haven't even
I feel like I started a minute vivid
okay let's let's let's slow it down like
way way too excited today so this is the
Sephora play box it's $10 a month you
buy it on sephora.com you can cancel at
any time I mean it's pretty easy to deal
with and of course it's a website that
if you're like me and you love shopping
on safar's website easy to navigate but
they always send 50 Beauty Insider
points that you can redeem in your
account your support account and it
always comes with five little trial
sized products and a little pouch of
some kind so the theme this month is
feel the love let's see and like I
always say in these I don't do a lot of
unboxings on my channel but this is one
that I still do and I do pay for it with
my own money it's not cents me because a
it's a great way to discover new
products at Sephora but also it's just
nice that all of these products you can
buy at Sephora and it's not like from
all these different random brands
because they're brands you never heard
of which is fun but they're hard to buy
if you actually liked it so ooh
first thing is from one of my new
favorite skincare brands belief this is
their moisturizing eye balm so I've got
their just like their moisture balm like
moisturizer and I really been enjoying
that but I'm excited to try their eye
balm because I do I have really been
enjoying this so I've heard amazing
things just generally about this brand I
don't know that I've heard about the eye
balm specifically like if people like it
but again I'm excited to give it a try
and this will probably last a while cuz
with eye cream I feel like you don't
need a lot to get to cover that area
I've also heard they heard good things
about this this is from the brand
pharmacy and I've tried some of the
pharmacy is that their sheet masks and I
really really liked it so I'm kind of
intrigued by this brand it's their green
clean makeup melt-away cleansing balm so
cleansing balms my favorite way it's
debt Wow it's definitely like a waxy
balm there's a little bit of a slight
smell
kind of fresh it smells good though but
nothing like too too too strong where
it's gonna like turn you off I don't
think but I will definitely use this see
this would be a great trial size but
being seven months pregnant I don't
think I'm gonna be traveling a lot
lately or anytime soon so probably will
just use it instead of putting it my
travel Jordan waiting to use and I'll
probably just use it because I want to
know how it is cuz I have heard such
good things about this brand all right
now there's sample in here ooo laura
mercier it's their cat rose gold caviar
stick eye color so the color is in rose
gold and is it makeup by Tiffany D that
really likes their caviar six she was
talking about this me I mean I think it
was quite a while ago but I'm like there
was a specific shade she really liked to
just kind of put all over the lid and
blend him was to her I don't know but
it's just like a little thicker pencil
that is really pretty I could see myself
just putting that all over the lid and
blending it in and you really could
probably call it a day really really
creamy how much comes in here I mean
it's not a ton but if you're using it
everyday I guess you would probably go
through it pretty quickly but if you're
not it's gonna take you a while to go
through that so I like this kind of
champagne e color I can see this being
pretty Oh blends nicely too just gives
it a really beautiful sheen it's gonna
end up looking like I feel like when I
do looks like that on my eyes I get more
compliments than ever cuz it looks a
little bit more effortless but it just
looks so beautiful look alright next
thing Oh from NARS it's their Velvet
Matte lip pencil in let's go crazy this
might be the first NARS product I've
gotten in one of these looks like a nice
fuchsia and they're both matte lip lip
pencils are really nice I mean you can
line your lips with it color it in it's
like a lipstick it stays on pretty well
it doesn't dry down to the point where
you're gonna like where it's gonna last
for 12 hours you're still gonna need to
reapply kind of like a lipstick but it's
just an easy format to apply and I like
to even kind of line especially with
bolder colors like this it's nice to
have kind of a two in one that's really
really awesome
gosh that alone is making this worth it
in my opinion
there's the Sephora brand Rouge matte so
it's a lipstick and it's in rebel chic
it's a tiny baby lipstick tiny tiny so
cute oh this is more of a vampy color oh
oh yeah this is a berry color I love
berry lipsticks so much so that's like
really really up my alley very very
creamy for a matte lip color very very
creamy like surprisingly creamy I feel
like Sephora does their Matt's really
nicely like their matte lip cream is
actually very nice so it's kind of a
brand that you know it's the store brand
so some people overlook it but it's most
of the stuff is really really good if
you'd be interested in me doing just a
Sephora brand like review please let me
know I would love to delve more into
their store brand and I really haven't
so I did that for Ulta where I did a
best summers of the actual Ulta brand of
makeup and I discovered a lot of new
favorites so I can link that below but
again let me know if you'd be interested
in a Sephora brand one it would take me
a while because I need to order it and
then try it out but so they'll say
sometimes I don't know if they always do
send a perfume sample maybe they always
do this is the Chloe little perfume
I remember my best friend Sarah loved
this perfume or at least she bought it
once I don't know that she loved it but
I would have to assume she bought it she
did anyway it does smell nice it's a
very clean feminine scent it's not super
sweet it's not super spicy it's cutting
out super floral it's like if you mixed
all of it you get this it's a very
pleasant scent though I think I've grown
to like it more than what I remember
because I think I remember smelling it
on her and I'm like I like it but it
wouldn't be one I'd wear but the more
I'm smelling and I feel like I actually
do quite like it so that was everything
in there I know that was like uber fast
for me but I think that Ashley pretty
excited about all of these I'm really
excited about these two skin care
products really excited about the NARS
lip product the Sephora one I'm excited
about I mean I've got plenty of
lipsticks but I mean that's a formula
I've never used and then the caviar eye
stick I'm totally gonna use and the
perfume so this is probably one of the
best months I've personally had based on
my own preferences you know there been
other months that I didn't love it but
you guys were like no this is my
favorite I got the same things and so it
totally did
on what you need and what you use in
your collection so I think month to
month you know all of us might disagree
on what's the best month so if your
interest in this of course I'll link it
below but other than that I hope you
enjoyed if you want to watch last month
Sephora play unboxing I will link it
below if you're curious is like okay
month to month how does the box differ
you know is it always this good I will
link that below for your reference and I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
