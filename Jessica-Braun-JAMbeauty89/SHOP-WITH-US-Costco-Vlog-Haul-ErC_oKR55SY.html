we well really we're going because we
need to but also my car is getting its
oil changed and so Tyler Street
yes we're like now let's let's go so I
could have this baby at any moment I
mean really ideally we have a little
while on her but
so we're wanting to kind of stock up on
like a lot of frozen stuff frozen food
some healthy some not but also just some
of our favorites that we get at Costco
like every time so we're gonna share
that with you guys because just thought
this would be fun it's kind of informal
please it's completely anything we ever
do it's for mold but anyway so we let's
just go shopping the chair is except for
amazing but mostly I just want Dez we
actually have a could you light it right
yeah I love that there's a shield yeah
we had a fire and we put it on our deck
and we knew was gonna get hot but it
just it was just too hot so we're like
you know what I really want to get
something like this where it's like you
get the key from the top but it keeps it
cool on the bottom so you still got a
place to put a plate or drinks or
something around it if you want I know
one day how much no
but seriously one day they found a geeks
on us are geeking out of it and this is
the problem on so the cautious I'd like
to come we know what you want but the
problem is that we go through this like
the the Rando Isles and there's always
cool stuff like this attitude ease yeah
twenty bucks
couldn't do something yeah and like
there's like we always have like a drink
table set up like put this out there you
got your own cheese in here whatever you
whatever you mean I guess you can make a
screwdriver I didn't think about that
oh did you put I was serious I really
wanted it can anyone name what show
that's what they call it orange vodka
how is nobody thought it I'm in very
heavy these are my favorite black bears
black bears are my favorite fruit period
but also strawberries and then Tyler
Crabb did shining of blueberries so I
learned from someone I worked with her
husband I don't know exactly his title
but something to do we can walk and talk
walk and talk shop with her her husband
is something do with produce here in
Indiana where we live and he said that
Costco gets the first pick of the litter
with produce period because they always
weather so much yes for the best yeah
it's always the best produce and so what
they were saying was that if you go and
like all the strawberries look really
bad it means that the strawberry crop
right then is not very good because they
were picking the best of the best
cuz cost of its first dip so I just
thought that was really
hmm nine dollars five and half pounds
not bad my personal favorite Honey Crisp
why are they so expensive because
they're so delicious I hate being in the
cold station so cool like hurry get the
vegetables and run Organic better half
price
can we get regular carrots and water
just regular sure okay so when you get
like a bag of like frozen broccoli cuz
obviously fresh broccoli is the best but
sometimes it's just easier I have frozen
broccoli but it's all it's all sticks
and limbs it's nothing there's no weeks
it's all twigs there's it's all the
little like it's the faces that nobody
wants it's the way to go get only the
florets and it's refrigerated so we like
to think it's a little better than
frozen I don't know what it is
regardless this is like two to three
pots worth and it's organic which means
nothing more than you would think yeah I
read a book about how organic you can
put organic on baby truly organic
because there's no standard not very
strong and I'm sure if you're gonna have
a heyday with this never like I've given
up on salad
putting tons of genes
because I'm like
always buy these comes with two quiche
is and you freeze them there oh yeah the
taste is for 30 minutes and then dinners
okay and there's two of them and you can
even do it for breakfast that's what's
kind of nice we have not done that yet
which is funny because this is egg one
of these if they're like taquitos but a
little more real and also probably taste
better
okay 38 weeks pregnant Plus shopping
means I'm sitting for a while well Tyler
finishes a few more aisles in them are
gonna go in the rest of the food so
we're we never go through these middle
aisles here at Costco well not never but
I just went through and I'm buying like
a little four I'll let pack and the vine
some mint some life skipper mints but
he's looking at some patio stuff and
then we're gonna go to the rest of the
food but I am like having a lot of
Brexton Hicks contractions and when they
get stronger towards the ends so it's
like you always have to like take a
second oh my who hold on it just takes
your breath away doesn't really hurt
hurt it's just uncomfortable more than
they think so
a couple minute break simple I'm a cadet
it's simple even after death I had an
Italian foreign exchange student living
for free tea oh wait they might have
seen him in the London vlogs we met he's
from Italy I think he flew and met us in
London so his name was pretty teal and
one day I was like hey I'm gonna sword
you anything is like yeah simply not get
that like was like what it's simply
Magadan saying it simple in that how did
you guys eventually find out he was like
you know what that's like no we find the
bag remember all the way downstairs to
the kitchen
he's like stiffly Nakada cousin Agatha
makes a magnet hey try
kind of like in our front like our
literal sidewalk to our front door we're
gonna yeah sometimes we feel like we are
both saying like sometimes they can look
a little dinky substantial they're like
I don't know two feet tall they're a
little bit more like like it's like
normal one of the ones you know they
just kind of like they almost like don't
we'll see we get some doggie food for
Pinocchio he loves this nature's domain
what's the yellow pine potato oh we
could try that this time what was the
red the red is turkey meal on sweet
potato he really did yeah
each cream
yeah we got here might get some
mahi-mahi
everything's so expensive but I'm sure
more fish and it's hard because I don't
like salmon is okay I'm not a big fan
you really like sailors yeah
then I guess it's a decent amount of
them and we don't eat like maybe once
every other week that like that we eat
it at home we genuinely make it so we
also got some chicken I like to get pop
one chicken
cuz again if I'm forcing myself to eat a
salad it's one way that makes it taste
better I forced the healthy stuff in but
then I also forced chicken in it's a
lose win situation could not try these
yet
you know we have tried that hard
delicious those were encountered
so bad for you instead
jyllian calories never less cost without
buying one or two of these
they're amazing so it's it's just a
Kirkland house blend medium roast but
it's roasted by Starbucks
it's delicious a two pound bag for ten
dollars which is a great deal especially
for any version yeah it's right up your
life it's really good it's so good and
it's so cheap for one date and then you
turn around like the Starbucks brand
wherever that is is like twice the price
Oh like for real bags of it oh yeah like
it a regular store going for two and a
half pounds because we go through a lot
I go through a lot of coffee well now
that I'm gonna be at home just over a
week I'm always because I got this and
it was such a good deal and it's so good
it's I've always got to spend like you
know but they always have all these like
kind of cool ones
let's try gonna try all those we play we
bought more stuff from with like
Kirkland and Sam's Club if you don't
like it you got it yeah great you so we
grabbed some bacon we fries a lot of it
cuz we don't honestly it's funny kids
looking at like what we're getting I'm
like it looks like we don't need healthy
I feel like we actually do eat decently
healthy we really do I feel like we're
like 50/50 so there's no but like when
we cook we genuinely cook but then like
anyway drumsticks also this is a pretty
good deal I really like this special
okay and then their hot dogs are
freaking to die for we freeze a lot of
them because we just bought a giant
freezer for our garage cuz you gotta eat
salad to stay healthy and then you gotta
eat the burger to stay sane so I think
that sounds fair
so Charlie bought these for me last time
I don't even remember when that's a
while ago yeah but it's chai latte
concentrate I literally saw me oh my
gosh Jessica loves tri ki lytics I've
never really said that to him I've only
had every like well it turns out so he
bought it for me I'm like oh thanks what
made you names like hey you love them
right like
anyway turns out they are too freaking
delicious you Larry mix this with half
milk or almond milk or swimming whatever
dude still drink soy milk I don't know
anyway it's delicious over ice oh my
gosh I just have one he was right
there's a cooler here house like oh we
can just put it like on the back porch
they can have like friends and family
over you get your own drinks and stuff
got their grilling
kids get off the shed could you get off
the shed please anyone know what that's
from anyway that's a deep breath I'm so
we're getting our favorite this could
have been in here but I don't think I
talked about it it's like 18 things that
mom and if you dip it in hummus you've
worn these like literally I just warmed
in the microwave and then dip it in
hummus oh my god literally a two pack oh
yeah and it's awesome and it's awesome
but this we usually do pita chips but
this is a game changer yeah it really is
and like we'll have it with dinner
most nights what weren't you at Target
you said like four pieces were $12 it
was literally like a two pack of these
I'm not joking it was a two pack for
like $3 micro world where I can get 18
for 550 water fresca so we usually have
like two in the freezer just waiting in
the wings cuz they're so freakin cool so
we one thing downside of wholesale
places like this it's like we wanted to
get this a jar of Moo falada but it's
two giant jars you've never had to move
a lot of like sandwiches from New
Orleans but it's way too much move a lot
of spread it's like olives and like
stuff they move I don't say it I thought
it was moved a lot of we looked it up I
don't member what do you know that was
years ago I don't how I sound
how do we I don't know walk your mouth
feels weird
also moving lips stuffs everywhere cuz
I've been trying samples and they just
had their hazelnut spread
I'm Brad
so good too bad it's terrible for you
every time we've come here I've wanted
to buy this and I keep going but it's
like $7 for these three giant bottles
that's good yes
so Asians thing is with you I'm probably
had a honey barbecue too
they're only delicious but with that
popcorn chicken we just bought hmm
sorry I'm zooming in on the honey that's
the kind of honey we bought but we have
a smaller one I didn't know they had
giant ones here also it's also because I
think that's the one that has the camp
really good stockist honey does it ever
stops it it goes hey I'm like habit
pinches it off
20:18 yeah that's a big year oh dear
you've not tried Dave's killer bread a
co-worker told me about it
and it is amazing we're not going to say
he's really mean it because we still
have a 2-pack at home in the freezer but
it's really thick like nutty seedy bread
which I really like
but it's kind of a good it's like um
ex-convicts it's like they can work
there and kind of get their you know
kind of restart their life something
like that you can read it on the back
but I think that's really cool and it's
absolutely delicious
well do I really need this much Tylenol
no see then I'm like oh maybe I'll just
get this one but this is such a good
deal but I'm like but are they just
gonna expire it's so the housing
cabinets in there 500 milligram that's
like way more than I don't know I might
look at the expiration date 919 no way I
eat a thousand feet a thousand of those
before then maybe I do just get this
rapid release actually kind of sounds
good anyway this is the best deal in
town on that like coffee pods and
they're pretty good let's see what else
they got I love looking at all their
skincare and stuff
I never buy anything because I don't
need any of it but I like looking at it
like over here I'm like wow that was
pretty nice
I do get their makeup remover wipes here
they last like literally forever because
I don't use them on my face I just use
them to wipe off swatches and stuff this
makes me think of my mom she always used
Olay I wonder she still does
I don't think so cuz I think I always
give her skincare she always used to use
a little Olay thing and it has a certain
smell that makes you think of my mama
I think I need to put my feet up ha ha
ha
they always say walking is great for you
especially later in pregnancy to kind of
get things moving but oh man I'm tired I
think tonight does that put your feet up
kind of a night maybe Tyler will make
dinner he makes the best dinners he's
putting everything in the trunk right
now look at how cute he is
he cleaned out my car last night and it
was very sweet he vacuumed and detailed
and for what needed it alright we're
done five hundred dollars later oh my
god nasty we and we just got a freezer
yeah okay ready veggie like it's a giant
for our garage and we are stocking up on
that frozen stuff we figured just quick
meals will be nice right after having
the baby and we know some people make us
some meals and stuff when I'm done yours
already frozen three other loops of up
three meat Lopes yeah what I've got like
a book that's like make it and freeze it

that you could make you bake them and
you freeze them or yeah whatever but
that's gonna be nice yeah so it'll be
