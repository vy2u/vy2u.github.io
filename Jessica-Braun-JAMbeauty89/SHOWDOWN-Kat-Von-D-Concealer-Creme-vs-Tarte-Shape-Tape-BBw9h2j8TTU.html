a dupe video except for the dupes are
like the same price but I wanted to do
this comparison and I'm gonna actually
apply it for you show you how they look
side by side but I wanted to do this
comparison because I recently reviewed
the Tarte shape tape and I haven't
really done a video about this Kat Von D
locket concealer cream concealer wait I
said that too many times anyway I
haven't really done a video about it and
I kind of realized as I play with both
of these more and more separately that
they're totally the same product but I
think I figured out which one I like
more but there there's a two dollar
difference so let's kind of break this
down and if you're just wanting to see
the demo of these two side-by-side I'll
put the time stamp here on the screen
and a clickable time stamp down below if
you just want to watch the demo but I'm
let's talk about these products first
so the shape tape is only sold at Ulta
and I'm sure like on tartes website but
it's $24 whereas the Kat Von D lock-it
concealer cream is 26 so it's a
difference of two dollars I bought my
Kat Von D one at Sephora the Tarte one
has fourteen different shades the Kat
Von D one has like what is it twenty-one
shades if I counted that right so
there's definitely a bigger range in the
Kat Von D line although it is two
dollars more and they also have a
completely white one so if you needed
white or you wanted to mix it to lighten
something I think that's cool I don't
own that one yet but I just think it's
kind of cool that they offer that I do
think the Tarte
packaging is cuter that's totally my
opinion I mean obviously but it is cuter
but let's talk about the applicators the
Tarte applicator is a huge dough foot
which is kind of fun but the Kat Von D
one has this kind of more triangular
pyramid shaped one that I really really
like I like both but I think I like the
cap on the applicator better so let's go
and get into the demo and then we'll
talk about these products as a whole and
kind of read the claims that they have
online and see if they live up to those
claims okay so I've got my shape tape in
my Kat Von D I'm gonna do the Kat Von D
on my right side here and the Tarte on
the Left which might be opposite for you
so let's start with the Kat Von D so I'm
gonna use the Beauty Blender for both of
these I've realized this both of the
formulas it just works the best because
they'd use these do it's early in the
morning they do
these do have really high coverage and I
think they look the best when they're I
don't want to say sheared out but kind
of sheared out so that they look a
little more natural while still having
all that coverage I'm really not going
to put a lot on I'm just gonna kind of
spread it out with my Beauty Blender
definitely brightening
so it's definitely a brightening formula
you can instantly see when you compare
them this eye looks way less tired which
is nice you can still see my fine lines
again as I've said in past videos I've
never found a concealer where it just
like magically hides fine lines you know
that just doesn't happen but it
certainly sunk into them but I like to
kind of use my finger or something to
kind of see if I can get that to set on
its own before setting with the powder
so let's try the shape tape on the other
side I'll have when I did my shape tape
I still might be too much I put way too
much on during that because it's still
new to me and it was a lot this still
might be a little bit too much no that's
not too bad using the other side of this
beauty blender if you're worried about
them mixing I'm sure you're very
concerned okay so of course I've got
like little bags into my eyes because I
really am I will go early today to try
to film here and so I am a little tired
so looking at it you can see I mean I
still have like little bags under my
eyes which you know it is what it is but
you can definitely still see my fine
lines with both so I like to use the
heat of my hand to kind of blend that in
but they both have pretty much the exact
same coverage exact honestly the days
that I wear the Kat Von D versus the
Tarte shaped tape I have I like if I had
no recollection of what I'd use that day
I would never have known which it was
because they both always look really
good they last all day I'm talking all
day they have the same amount of
coverage they're really comfortable to
put on and blend especially when you use
less um I think I like the applicator I
like that the dark shape tape is so big
it's just kind of fun but I actually do
like the applicator the Kat Von D how
it's like a little pointed it doesn't
really matter because it's not like
you're using these to blend but if I
were to pick between the two I do like
the packaging
the cap on do you want a little bit
better so to see it up close this is the
side that had the cap on D and this is
the side that had the my eyes are Recker
this is the side with the chart shape
tape so honestly I'm like looking at it
now that's a birthmark by the way the
free show sorry honestly looking at it
this way I think I like the Kat Von D
one just a little bit better I think it
it's hard to tell and like I said I
haven't set these I just want you guys
to see how they are just the way they
are with no powder on them because a lot
of powders can brighten it and then it
kind of changes it but I think I might
like the Kat Von D one better all right
so let's start with the Tarte shaped
tape on Ulta the little blurb it says
about it is that it's cruelty free
gluten free and vegan and it says you
sculpt and highlight as you mask
imperfections with this - and one full
coverage concealer I totally agree it's
full coverage definitely the it's
hydrating long wearing formula delivers
natural radiant coverage across all skin
types so you can instantly brighten and
cover acne dark circles redness while
softening a look of pores and fine lines
where one is two shades lighter or
darker work it as a creamy highlight or
contour light blendable formula so it
says powered by Amazonian clay and
conditioning mango seed and shea butters
the nutrient rich concealer helps
promote skin elasticity and illumination
with each crease free application I
don't agree that its crease free
regardless of how much you use I know in
my original video a lot of you guys were
likely you use too much I agree I used
too much but as I've used this more and
more I still it instantly goes into my
fine lines even when I said it it still
does that's my fine lines I feel like
mine are just crazy I don't know but I
know that I'm not alone and that because
a lot of you guys are like yeah I notice
it creases too
not enough that it bothers me every
concealer I use does so it's not I've
kind of just gotten used to that and
kind of accepted that so it doesn't
bother me but I don't agree that it's
completely crease free um so let's read
that but I do agree that it's very I do
think it's pretty hydrating I don't
think it like illuminates dry skin by
any means and it's certainly high
coverage it blends really well
let's look at the Kat Von D claims this
is on Sephora site the little
it says it's got 24-hour we're an
instant full-coverage I agree I don't
know what 20 I don't think I've ever
worn anything 24 hours okay that can't
be true but that's not very often that
you'd wear something like this for 24
hours it says locket concealer cream
does everything a traditional concealer
does and then some it brightens the
under eye area I would agree with that
covers blemishes corrects discoloration
contours and bakes so again you can get
a darker shade if you wanted like a
cream contour type shade this next level
formula applies smoothly and blends
easily for a locked-down smooth even
finish wide array of shades offers one
of the most extensive shade ranges in
concealer that's probably true select
the perfect under-eye corrector and
exact skin tone concealing shade with
easy-to-navigate names that feature the
undertone and that's true so the one I
have is called l7 warm and it's it says
fair buttercream with warm undertone and
I really think that's accurate kind of
the perfect shade so it is almost a
little bit easier to try on line of
course I just looked up a bunch of
swatches as well of both of these when I
was ordering shade range even includes a
pure white called whiteout for dramatic
highlighting and mixing in two other
shades to create custom tones so it's
got complexion brightening pigments
ultra nourishing hydro boost complex its
crease proof and hydrating again I don't
agree that its crease proof you think
the Kat Von D one crease is a little bit
less than the Tarte shape tape but
they're both I mean they're still going
into your fine lines ideal for the
delicate under-eye area that the
applicator was modeled after an artist
paint brush with the tapered tip for
precise corners and a wide base to
efficiently coat larger areas I really
do like the applicator on the Kat Von D
one just a little bit better so I would
say both of these live up to the hype
and the claims that they both have it's
kind of what's in your taste when it
comes to maybe branding packaging if you
want to save two dollars if you've got
an Ulta gift card first is this a 401 I
mean it's kind of up to you I think you
can't go wrong either way I do think I'm
leaning as I really tried these
side-by-side today I've been filming
I've been looking at myself in the
mirror I really do think I'm leaning
towards the Kat Von D one because of the
shade range
I like the applicator a little bit
better I think it sinks into fine lines
just
little bit less they both have the same
coverage they're both easy to blend so
like I said you can't go wrong either
way but I do think these are pretty
close dupes for each other which I think
it's just fun to find fortunately I wish
I had drugstore dupes for these I
haven't found drugstore dupes yet if you
know of one that you think might be
please let me know below I know I'm not
the only one that's curious I'm sure a
lot of you guys watching would rather
save money and buy a cheaper one me too

you if you like these kinds of demo

lot more drugstore typically so if
