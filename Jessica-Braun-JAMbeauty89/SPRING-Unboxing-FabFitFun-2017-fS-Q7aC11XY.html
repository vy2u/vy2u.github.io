my fabfitfun unboxing for spring and
this is not sponsored they do send me
these for free as I think almost almost
every subscription box I get for free so
it doesn't really sway what I say about
it and you'll see that in any of my
other subscription box videos as well
even if I was sent it for free I will
tell you if I hate it or loved it that
month so please know that I will always
be honest with you guys but I know that
they give me a promo code for this so if
you are interested I will put the promo
code in the first two lines on my
description box down there if you want
to save some money if you're actually
thinking about ordering it but let's go
ahead and unbox the spring one so you
open it it always has like a little
magazine explaining different things in
it um little like coupons and things
will have woo so it definitely looks a
little bit springy
let's see what's actually inside so
let's talk about the like the beauty
products I see first the first one is
from BRE Oh Geo it's the rose Arco milk
leave-in conditioning spray now I love
there I have it in my shower right now
the Brio geo deep conditioning like mask
balm whatever they call it I love that
stuff Allah like it's so reparative to
my hair it's like a dream come true
so I'm intrigued to try this it says
it's ultra lightweight as a nourishing
blend of rosehip argan oil and coconut
oils rose Arco so it's rose so the RO s
and Rose are 4 Argan and then Co for
coconut oils that's cute vitamin E it
combats dryness restore shine heat
protects and strengthens hair so I
typically will put like a an oily serum
front on the bottom half of my hair
before I blow-dry it maybe I'll try this
and kind of switch it out because this
will be a little bit more more
lightweight I do have thinner hair so I
feel like this might be a little bit
better and keep a little of the volume
that I naturally lose when I use that
kind of an oil heavy serum so excited to
try that and that retails for $20 so the
next thing is from dr. Brandt it's their
microdermabrasion age defying exfoliator
we just got one of these in like a
boxycharm or something like
but it wasn't this exact one it was like
in black so I don't know what the
difference is but it says it renews skin
radiance polishes and smooths and it
helps diminish the look of fine lines
you dampen your skin with warm water you
gently massage it into your skin for one
to two minutes rinse well pat dry use 1
to 2 times per week allow 3 days between
applications so this retails for $79
that's a lot of money for something that
you can only use like once or twice a
week
wow so cool excited to give it a try
that's a lot of money though next thing
is from deborah lippmann these look like
miniatures though of their nail polishes
so it's their nail polish set in Blue
Orchid / like a virgin so the white ones
like a virgin blue the blue one is Blue
Orchid this retails for the duo for $19
it's a really pretty light blue color
for spring so that's it's like a light
periwinkle and I love that the white I
might use it has a little tip in their
magazine it says use a toothpick to
create a marbling technique with both it
says use a toothpick to do like a
marbling technique with both I've never
tried that but these would be pretty
colors to do that with especially for
spring so I have the only deborah
lippmann colors I've tried are their
glitters which are really good and
that's what I own and they're like base
and topcoat which I didn't really like
but I've heard you know generally good
things so I will definitely try that
that's awesome next thing in here is
this real her I am fabulous liquid
lipstick lip gloss and lip liner so it's
like a little set so as I'm opening this
it says it retails for 48 dollars and
it's got deep oh never mind I've got a
certain oh I've got deep red so the
options were deep red deep nude or
neutral pink and they sent deep red I
don't know how they determine that like
I don't know so when you slide it out
they're all full-size okay I love the
phrases on these this one here says I am
tough this says I am a fighter and then
this says be yourself be real her
so this is a lipliner oh it's so smooth
look at that just glides on it's a sharp
and tight but it is the creamiest holy
moly that is creamy the next thing is a
I assume this is the lip gloss and I am
a fighter I don't know if that's like
the shade name but it's more of a kind
of warm toned red I feel like the lip
gloss I feel like the lip liner is more
berry and this one's a little bit more
of a warm toned red it's still pretty
like I feel like it so go with it but
and then the lipstick and this must be
like a liquid lipstick and I am tough is
a little bit more cool tone that is so
pretty right there at recess for $48
next thing are these hair skin and nail
gummies how much should these retail for
I keep seeing these in the store and
almost buying them but then I don't well
it doesn't have the price in here it's
not on the list but this is totally
awesome it has a lot of biotin what else
is in it some vitamin C vitamin E there
are some calories I mean there's some
sugar in it so it's 3 grams of carbs 2
grams of those are sugar 15 calories but
I feel like I'm just way more likely to
take my vitamins I know because I'm like
a five-year-old I am way more likely to
take it if it is in coming form and I am
woman enough to admit that it's just the
truth
alright let's keep going next thing is
this Karuna hydrating plus face mask i
love sheet masks so this one retails for
$28 are you freaking serious now
there are three of these in here thank
goodness 28 divided by 3 that's a little
over $9 I know it's a 33 cents for each
one of these that is a $10 sheet mask
now would I ever buy this on my own
nah would I definitely use these oh yeah
but I'm gonna save them for special
events things like that I've tried a
coruña mask before and it was amazing
so but they're so pricey which is why
I've never bought it because it's too
pricey so that's exciting this is one of
those things and that is one of the
things I like about these kinds of boxes
you
kind of you splurge a little to get the
box but you get these really luxurious
items that you're not gonna probably buy
for yourself on your own so it is nice
so I'm excited about that
next thing in here it looks like it is
jewelry by Emerald and do or Dove it's
their joshua tree cage bracelet and it's
$80 are you serious it's cute though so
it's like a kind of bangle type bracelet
what I have to that's kind of fun though
I like that it's just like simple any
kind of size it it's not really easy to
oh yes yes it is so I kind of it's like
a cage bracelet almost but you can I
just kind of squished it together to get
it to fit a little better and I know
that weakens the metal but I'm not gonna
wear it otherwise so I'd rather I don't
know anyway but that's kind of cute now
would I ever pay $80 for it no that's
the freaking insane
yeah and it's a trendy piece that I
wouldn't necessarily have picked out for
myself but now that I have it I'll
actually wear it so it's fun it's a way
to get me to branch out of my own little
comfort zone next thing is this gypsy
boho Beach Roundy it says it retails for
$50 this is whether you're headed to a
picnic the beach or a concert get around
town with the perfect Roundy what is
around II has fringe on it I know that
much is it like a blanket yes so it's a
round I mean I'm not going to show it to
you it's a round blanket it's got this
fun like little fringe on the side kind
of fun so that's cool and it doesn't
take up much space this would be great
like if we know we're maybe traveling
and we don't have a lot of room in our
luggage but we know we're gonna be doing
something where we'd need something like
this this would be perfect cuz it
doesn't take up a lot of room and again
even for a beach that would be really
small my beach bag but it looks really
big $50 is a lot of money okay last
thing in here is this bag it's like a
little zipper pouch bag it's pretty big
though it's like 11 by 6 or something
like that 11 myself I mean it's pretty
big
call anis has beach please and it's the
Millie brand it's $45 that's a lot of
money um Wow
but I will say it's big it feels really
really tough like it's not going
anywhere fast it's a real
thick is it nylon is that what that's
called it's got a really good zipper
here and then something if you wanted to
hang it from something so that is fun I
mean again I'll probably use it you
think this would be in a summer box that
I guess spring as you're getting ready
for summer or like spring break I don't
know anyway so the retail value that
they said is three hundred and seventy
four dollars so they'd already tabulated
it so I mean you're getting a lot more
than what you paid for for this box but
again that doesn't matter if you can't
afford the box itself so you know you
got to think about what's in your budget
what makes sense for you if it'd be
worth it or if you'd rather spend that
money on something you know what it is
and you're not surprised but if you like
me like I like surprises so I think it's
fun every once in a while you know like
my stitch fix unboxings I love that box
because I like being surprised I like
them sending me clothes and me not
having picked them out I'm kind of going
outside of my comfort zone so if you're
interested in the stitch fix unboxings I
will link my most recent one below just
so you can kind of get an idea of that I
love that box but that's one that I buy
on my own with my own money so hopefully
this video is helpful if you are curious
about any of my other subscription box
unboxings I will link my entire playlist
below it is a very long place otherwise
I hope you'll subscribe in the meantime
and I hope you'll come say hi on my
social media and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
