he's so awkward anyway and we are here
to unbox two different things now we
together of unboxed try the world before
and I can leave that the most recent
video where we unboxed it below but I
usually unbox the cozy mug subscription
box by myself but I thought you know
what since my channel is obviously
makeup focused and his is travel focused
together you get this yeah that really
makes that round all make a cup a cup
tea tea tea food kitchen culinary and
all the letters so we figured we would
just do these together since they are
both like food and tea and drinks you
know and I'll just go together I'm gonna
figure we would just do together and in
the future we might do try the world and
cozy mug unboxings on his channel cuz I
do think cuz he does like on his web
your website you've got like a food area
donating food and travel so he's it's
just more catered towards them even
though I love it so if you're wanting to
watch these in the future you might go
over there maybe shameless plug he's so
cute I mean anyway Pooh Bear and if we
both look crazy okay Tyler you never
look crazy finally crazy it's been a
long day of teaching I'm just always
crazy inside and out yes definitely true
okay so we'll start with try the world
all the info of how much this is both of
these are per month and links and stuff
will be below especially if I have any
promo codes I think I have a promo code
for this one so definitely will like
that
let's my know whoever's ready locos
Argentina Argentina Spanish so I don't
it lasted so long
hola welcome to Argentina
ten seconds too long do you you can do
Argentina so okay why Argentina so again
if you don't know about try the world
they always give you a culture guide for
whatever the city is we didn't even say
what try the world is what are they
gonna do this company keeps getting
better and better it's crazy so it's
basically a culinary box you're holding
it up you were holding it down there
like Jimmy Fallon when he holds up like
a record like yellow shears performing
tonight you don't set the record they
close up he just helped me you guys in
here look he just closed up I'm gonna
show thank you miss I can't lift it up
there we go
thank you miss little thing I don't know
Whitney everything all right so do we go
okay anyway so you get food from a
certain country or city in the world
which is really cool so oh did you want
that I just took it off and sink to
believe like you were a student I'm
sorry it's like a tri-corner hat looks
good if it's a koala so they walk you
through they give you like recipes and
like famous things that go on in that
country and even like this is an
Argentine poem and some songs like if
you're making a playlist which we
actually really do do you do do so it's
Buenos Aires playlist from there so I
just think that's so cool and for us we
like to make specific cuisines like for
dinner on certain nights and we really
do have like Spotify playlist for
different things and when I do my things
on my website which I've only done one
so far more coming I promise I put on
there not only just like one recipe but
like every recipe we made for the
appetizer for the main meal dessert I
have to include the playlist to music we
listen to what so it says what can I
find in my when it's a taste box let's
not read it let's see P crisp thumbs up
if you know about cookie crisp is that
well I think it might only be America
though cookie crisp I have no idea I'm
not up-to-date on myself a plus cool
buttery cookie or butter cookies these
look really really yummy and
so it's Argentinean huh this looks
really yummy
don't check their legit no no Jake they
do sing Jewish state
I only said Dulce as well but I think
that's Italian it's a dual saying do say
hey number you what does do say de
memory it's a fruit spread enjoyed from
Buenos Aires to Patagonia did I skip at
the whole yeah I don't know how to exit
well but I'm wondering in dumber
dates back to the Spanish occupation
you'll favourable pastries with hints so
it's sweet stuff which makes sense to
know those days in the name fruit filled
pies cut into thin slices enjoy with
goat cheese or top it off of a piece of
toast also oh well cookies we don't need
to read about we know all about cookies
there you go you're alright next oh I'm
already excited okay this is memories of
Patagonia or Pat the holy eyes to red
fruits Malbec red wine it's our favorite
kind of wine and honey sauce so it looks
like it's kind of a jam with like honey
notes and some wine let's read about it
you can jam and I think Malbec is from
Argentina isn't it didn't we read that
somewhere
that sounds about back and head to me I
wish what is this okay it's a marinade
perfect for seasoning lamb pork or
turkey I thought was more like a jam
Malbec marinade will soon become an
essential okay barbecue
maybe with berries from Patagonia honey
from local pond bus and Malbec wine from
Mendoza
it looks pretty yeah looks pretty
liquidy almost like a barbecue sauce
love me okay yeah yeah no I could junior
be awesome once we get our little grill
mail okay Oh would your turn now
we were doing this we ordered groceries
from Vitacost and we literally sat on
the floor the other day just opening it
it felt like it was Christmas when
you're taking turns new errands in a
country it's more cattle than people
fresh milk is a given this core module
says de leche is made with natural
ingredients with best breeds of cattle
this milky marmalade is the National Jam
of Argentina a caramel topping that can
beam right out of the jar or on ice
cream chocolate cake awesome
that sounds awesome can't wait wheat
alright next recipe are there were a lot
of jars in this I love that because that
means you get to use it for a bunch of
meals that
is whatever it says pasta Oh green
olives
I remember how as I say doing us there's
something like that and then of course
better days is green um where is it
though I went oh you're gonna die when
you find out what else is in here time
that you're gonna die this is a green
olive paste kind of like a topping on
green olives are freshly pitted I know
I'm about to lose my mind
I could eat olives by the handful both
awesome do I do
show ministry you get on the vine and
you just put them all in I don't have
follows or finds an Argentine take on
the traditional southern French tapenade
this spread is the key to making the
tastiest cannot face kind of face I
never known how to say that your next
garden party well we have lots of garden
you have garden parties everyone all the
time so we're very big in today yes I'm
enjoying with a fern a cocktail a dark
liqueur with hints of licorice for an
authentic experience any port daniel
will attest to awesome fantastic your
turn next
Chim Cheree to me children chimichurri
of whom and oh now see I made Chim
Cheree but that's this versus
chimichurri that's how it's always been
spelled you just said it I just say it
so I say to treat but it's because it's
like Jim Jim Jim Jimmy but it is
chimichurri chimichurri chimichurri
chimichurri Jim change anyway so that's
what this is but I've made it at home
like Fred like with fresh ingredients so
I mention that I've never actually tried
it anywhere else even like right at all
so this will be awesome to try it looks
like we have it on lamb here in the
picture it says parsley garlic oregano
red pepper and olive oil combined to
form the Argentine staple chimichurri
this robot served on the side as a dip
for meat and vegetables during barbecues
known as asados our Itza creates
all-natural seasonings and sauces as a
brand right or no maybe not I don't know
steak and awesome that sounds good that
sounds really good all right is the last
thing in here jimana
is it tea I'm assuming this is herbal
infusion by E Nesbit moon aromas from
the Andean mountains and
from Patagonia or Patagonia I don't know
blended with the Orient wisdom of the
art of tea so yeah it is it's like oh
they're so fragrant you can smell them
even though you can never eat floral
sorry return small like a harmonica
flavor is perfect that is pretty cool I
like that you get to try a lot of
different ones so that is awesome so
that was everything that was a lot and
man I love these boxes I think they're
just so fun like if Europe
here's what I would say if you're a
person that you know you've got a lot of
makeup and you really don't need make-up
subscription boxes but you like the idea
of what you need is something kind of as
a surprise I mean of course you're
paying for it but you get it kind of as
a surprise in the mail and your your you
and your spouse like to cook I think
this is the coolest I really like every
single month when it comes to every
other month I get so excited I mean
don't you know my favorite we use these
things all the time when we are cooking
and it's just so different and we it's
funny because we'll see something like
this and we'll do like a little research
on it read the pamphlet whatever and
then we'll might face a meal off of this
and we love to cook from a specific
country so we'll do an entire meal
around one country and this is great
because we have all this different stuff
from one country also freaking faith
know you've got a cleanup
you got cleanups on my house all right
yes so the next thing is the cozy month
and they always have their cute little
owl and it's always like a tea box I've
watched the tea and coffee but I guess I
don't really ever get coffee and I don't
know why I've always said that cuz it
really is tea center but you always get
like random extras and it's safe on its
girlfriend
so there's take one back there does she
work at Hooters so there they are
you're welcome what I'm lady no say
quango go back in nap
Oh perfect
every slap when I see thumbnails or
pictures or anything or even video and I
see say fonts just crooked is laying
there in the background always reading
laughs mean really has a personality to
me anyway
this is their desert box so they always
have different themes like February's
you'd like love or like in the fall is
my favorite fall and the holiday boxes
were unbelievable but we've already them
they've already had like a stormy spring
night box which is the last one which is
really it was really cool this is desert
let's again you guys go okay so first
thing I'm seeing here or free confetti
so that's good we can add that to our
confetti collection we do have okay so
we got fairy tale cookies faced-off
fairy tales you eat it it turns into a
frog that sounds right so right yeah no
it was a frog it turned into a cookie
then you eat cookie it's toffee
chocolate chip that sounds awesome
it tastes a pure enchantment Oh
who's the guy who's the famous singer
right now this thing's really nice you
in chaunt me oh I love Sampath
so we're enchanted by this so this is
wrapped so you looks like a parcel from
Harry Potter you know they're always our
souls
yeah cuz it's got like actual like 12
yarn that might as well be fine we'll be
fine
I love when they wrap this stuff okay so
there's a bunch of this Davidson steed
we've got caramel peach with coconut
what what although I love coconut and
see our modern age and coconut vanilla
cream spice dessert see oh these are all
dessert teas that makes sense deserve
bucks
um we're not very creme caramel or
caramel and what was the other one I
didn't get anything it was this one
cherries Jubilee so they're all desert
teas so that'd be fun and then in here
it also came with organic blue agave
like a little packet
it looks you know some other like honey
if you will and it's a sweetener right
yeah a low glycemic sweetener agave do
you know what else comes from agave
tequila tequila tequila you always will
make sure when you're drinking tequila
you get a 100% agave because it's
everything from that plant so it's I
made sure to try that yeah actually I
understand what this tastes like tequila
can we distill it in tequila maybe a
very tiny though yeah anyway all right
so we got two more teas we got red
velvet chocolate and banana chocolate
he's really are a lot of desserts he's
these would be a nice like just tree
that's probably why this is the dessert
box right right
who thought my line these are from the
Republican team oh that's a good
brilliant I think we've gotten a few
things from them and it's always really
really good edges are so classy
I mean if you like silk well just keep
the packaging just keep it we can frame
it all right let's go the next thing in
here is also wrapped oh they always been
cute stuff like this so this time they
sent in an elf nail polish come on oh uh
yeah that's yours look how pretty these
colors though hey that's mine I called
it it's like a really pretty like light
salmon color but like it's like muted
like it's grayed out it's really really
pretty I'm excited it's elf brand by the
way which it's really inexpensive but
you guys know I love L me too
so we got some little cars i stationary
and they got little macaroons on her
owns macaroons I just learned
Romy's that's it and these have little
deserve some and their postcards they
mmm elopes to to go with it just plain
white ones this is cute
see I love that this box is so fun to me
just because they it's always random
like it's always tea but then there's
always like a nail polish or postcards
are like last time it was a CD I'm like
why like you never know what to expect
for the extra bonus but it's always
pretty cute so this box and I just love
how they're themed I think it's cool so
