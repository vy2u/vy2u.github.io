want to share with you a bunch of
products that I bought strictly because
of the packaging these were products
that I got sucked into because I saw
them either online or and soared I was
like drooling I was like I need that
it's so pretty and then I tried it so
some of them I like a lot some of them I
don't so it's gonna be a mixed bag I
thought this video was so fun I saw
Emily Noelle do this recently and I
thoroughly enjoyed watching it so I will
link her video down below if you're
interested in seeing some more products
that another youtuber has bought just
because the packaging alright so first
thing was this tatcha luminous dewy skin
mist now this is also in a lot of these
are so youtuber made me buy it kinds of
purchases but when I saw the packaging
that's what like sold it for me like it
sealed the deal so this is a spray I
mean come on how beautiful is this
stupid it's stupid beautiful the sprayer
is gorge wha this OH
just tasted it this however is very very
dewy so I've had a love-hate
relationship with this where you know
I'll spray it on I'm like oh my gosh
it's too much but then I'll spray a
little much okay that looks okay you
just it's kind of finicky you have to be
careful with it but the brand tatcha has
really grown on me a lot I've tried a
lot of their products I'm like I really
like their eye serum and their Camellia
lip balm oh my gosh a lot of their
products and I'm still trying out more
and more and more but I have fallen in
love with a lot of them so this is one
that I still kept because I want to
continue to use it and they're the
ingredients in their skincare is really
really high-quality so I mean so it
wasn't a 100% regret but it was more of
a did I really need that Jess did you
really need it yes I did cuz the
packaging live in this mug I've said I
know I've shown it in a past video but
every time I feel like I should show it
this sweet little makeup II mug that
what have you guys sent so next product
I bought for the packaging was this
Physicians Formula spotlight primer it's
like an illuminating one I really like
this product actually I bought it online
I saw it and it was a newer product I
loved it it reminds me the BEC light
Becca backlight priming filter I might
like this even more it's a beautiful
sheen and may
you look like you're glowing from within
when you put it underneath foundation so
huh for that reason I mean yes it is
beautiful but it's also really good on
that same vein I bought this one for the
packaging this is the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi cloche n' and it's honestly I use
it the exact same way but isn't the
packaging so beautiful you're gonna see
the gold and rose gold trend and all of
these I'm sure you won't be surprised
this one is maybe a little more lotion
light than the last one but I mean they
end up having almost the exact same look
I think the L'Oreal one might be a touch
cheaper depending on maybe sales and
stuff but they're both drugstore and
they're both so pretty
maybe it depends on if you like a
squeezy two versus a glass bottle with
the pump but they're both so beautiful
you could mix them with foundation as
well to get kind of a glowy especially
bits like a matte full coverage one if
you want to kind of glow it up a little
bit that's a great way to do that too
this next one was a pretty chunk of
change this was the Guerlain
lor primer and it's gano got all these
gold flakes in it and it's supposed to
be you know have these anti-aging like
tightening properties guys I keep trying
this I don't get it
and I certainly have a need for
anti-aging I mean I'm 29 years old it's
time ain't slowin down you know I've got
little crow's feet I've always had
under-eye you know little like crinkles
so I looked calm crinkles anybody I like
to calm I mean I just came up with it
and now I like to call them crinkles you
know I mean that there's anti-aging
properties and I love the idea of it
tightening before you even put a
foundation on top but it just and maybe
it's because I have drier skin I just
don't ever really like the way it makes
my skin look I need to try it more
because I'm like listen this is
expensive I'm gonna freaking make this
work if it kills me
so you know I'm not gonna give up on
this anytime soon but this is something
that I would say don't run out and buy
if you have maybe dry skin like me or I
don't know I don't know I know that
there are other youtubers that love this
and I'm I'm trying I'm gonna I'm gonna
freakin make this work so if you know
any like secret cocktails where you're
like oh you've got to do this and it
works best with this kind of foundation
or let me know because I just I really
really want the story and is in the back
stupid it's so pretty does anyone else
feel like they're coming down with the
flu I mean literally last week there
were like 15 teachers out and one day
I'm like oh my gosh
so that's scary I've got my flu shot I
have the few kinds of like cold e flu
medicines I'm allowed to take as a
pregnant person and I'm like no please
please please I swear I already had the
flu like in the fall so I'm like please
don't but I've got a stuffy nose I swear
I was having crazy dreams last night
like I couldn't sleep well I'm like oh
no no no no no no no okay this one was a
more reached recent purchase this is the
Catrice light correcting serum primer I
just showed this in my Ulta Tryon Hall
where I tried on this and a bunch of
other stuff so I will link that below if
you're curious so I'm still kind of
determining how I feel about this but I
mean look at the packaging and this is
drugstore drugstore price it's available
at Ulta and I kind of felt like it was
similar to those other products I just
showed where it was like the spotlight
kind of priming illuminating primer this
was a little bit thinner of a
consistency but it has a very similar
effect where it's not super obvious on
the skin when you put it all over but it
does add a little bit of that
lit-from-within so do you need all three
of these no I mean it's kind of like is
there a good deal on one or maybe which
one's the cheapest you have a coupon or
a gift card because they're all the same
effect and I really really like it but
you don't need all three but another one
I bought for the packaging is the Stila
shimmer and glow liquid eyeshadow in
Jezebel it's got this gorgeous rose gold
cap oh my gosh and of course the product
inside is like a similar color oh my
gosh it's so pretty
so I really really like it I like the
shimmer and glows better than the
glitter and glows because those the
glitter ones do have a little bit of
glitter fallout now this still has a
little bit of glitter in it I've
realized which I'm like huh interesting
but I haven't noticed that same fallout
so if you didn't like the original
glittering glow ones you might be
interested in the shimmer ones but but
it's a good product and it stays on all
day I don't notice it creasing on my
eyes I'll just like take it
but onto my lid and then kind of blend
it up into the crease and that's about
it one that I bought for the packaging
and I was disappointed in is I've
mentioned this recently so I'll just
touch on it for a second the Becca under
eye brightening concealer it's all
pretty and like light peach rose gold E
and I'm like oh and it's like a creamy
under eye corrector that is so up my
alley
well it's just too moisturizing it
doesn't stay in place it just it's just
too emollient and I do like an emollient
kind of thing but it's too much so I
can't get it to really stay in place or
it just blends away completely because I
just keep blending so I can't get rid of
it because it's so cute you know what I
mean another one I bought for the
packaging is the drugstore one this
one's from covergirl it's their advanced
radius press powder and this is nice
because it's like a almost like a powder
foundation there's some nice coverage to
it but it's a little bit more radiant
it's it's not glittery but it does have
a little glow and so I use it on my
under-eye a lot but I bought it because
of like the kind of pretty new packaging
I really really like it that's literally
the only reason I tried it last one is
kind of a stretch because I actually
didn't buy it but I was literally within
days of purchasing this on support' as
web said I had it business for Ulta I
don't know I had it in my cart and I was
like going to buy this and a few other
things and then Too Faced happened to
send it to me so I'm gonna consider this
I bought it for the packaging kind of
thing because I was done anyway because
I saw the color so I'm like oh that's
pretty but it was genuinely genuinely
the packaging that sold me it's so like
nice it's really it's like my favorite
palette when it comes to the way it
looks ever now the shadows inside are
gorgeous I mean I can't complain about
this palette if you don't like warm
tones however you're not gonna like it
it's all matte let me just watch a few
gorgeous gorgeous colors really really
pigmented but they blend really well I
have no complaints about this but I just
especially love the packaging so this
one's worth it
and I wish all of Too Faced palettes
were in this kind of pie oh my gosh I
freaking love it if you've never felt
this you need to like go into a store
and just feel how nice the closure is
how nice the just all of it is so those
were all products that I bought because
the packaging with kind of like many
reviews of each whether I'd recommend it
not let me know if you like this style
of video by giving it a thumbs up and
subscribing before you leave and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
