going to share with you products that
either I'm surprised to see on sale but
also some products that I'm not at all
surprised to see are on sale so I saw
Lauren May Beauty do this video I think
where she was just talking about
products she wasn't surprised to see on
sale so I will leave her channel in her
video below cuz I love this idea it's so
fun to watch just for fun just kind of
shared my thoughts on why I think some
products are working why some didn't and
just some other things here and there
and then some of these are products that
I might have tried that I can tell you
like hey these are on sale they're
actually awesome go buy it now while
it's on sale so let's go ahead and get
into it so first thing that I was kind
of surprised at first to see on sale
this is from Anastasia and it's their
prism eyeshadow palette it's on sale for
$31.50 originally 42 this was a
limited-edition palette so we all knew
that when it came out that it would have
it that it would eventually be conned
preffer and that's why I didn't buy it I
try to limit myself on limited edition
because of my job here it's fun to show
and share from time to time and I do
still do some limited edition stuff but
I try not to do too much because over
time you eventually can't get it and so
if I love it and I'm using it in videos
you guys can't access it so regardless
it was a really colorful palette it had
a Lumiere phrase it had neutrals but it
definitely had some fun pops of color
and it was kind of the reviews were
mostly good some people were saying oh
it's still a little bit powdery or a
little bit which you know that's always
gonna be the thing now with them because
of their what was the palette because of
this subculture palette drama that
happened around if you don't use one of
those things that if you've never tried
an honest Asya palette and you're just
dying to try one this might be the way
to do it because it's got four and a
half stars on on Sephora's website four
and a half stars out of 980 reviews and
you know there i think there is a decent
amount of neutrals i guess looking at it
closer it's probably got a little more
colored no probably kind of it's like
half and half and it's got half man/half
shimmer that kind of a thing so it might
be the way to go if you're just wanting
to try one and you don't want to spend
42 but 31 is a little
more attainable for you it's not a bad
idea so I'm not really surprised it's on
sale because we all new limited-edition
eventually they're gone but I remember
when that pouch came out I remember
thinking oh like I didn't even know they
were really saying I feel like it just
kind of came out of the blue and some
people were really excited about but I
didn't feel like there was a huge hype
behind it another surprise to me was the
naked basics palette it's on sale for
$19 originally 29 iLike this palette I
don't still own it because it was kind
of one of those things that even for
someone as fair as I am the three or
four kind of lighter colors all blended
together they were all almost the same
shade they were slightly different and
it wasn't different enough of a gradient
to really get a full look for myself and
I love neutral looks I mean you can see
all my eyes now
I love neutral looks but it just wasn't
enough for me so well I think it's okay
I think $19 is a great deal for it so if
you're just wanting just a couple
neutrals and then a matte brown and a
matte black to travel with or just to
have in your makeup bag 19 bucks I don't
think that's crazy considering drugstore
products are like a lot of them are like
$15 at this point the Becca liquid
crystal glow gloss it's only $11 now
instead of 22 I own this but I feel like
there was like more of a yellow till one
I don't know if I own this pink one
maybe I do
regardless it's just one of those kind
of super glittery shiny almost lip
topper kinds of lip glosses and while I
think there's definitely a market for
that
I think 22 dollars is a lot for that I
can buy a really inexpensive glittery
gloss from what wild anyone and get it
for like 5 bucks $22 a lot to spend on
that if you're only gonna be putting it
on the center of your bottom lip or just
from time to time you're gonna use it I
think that's a lot and I wonder if
that's why it does say limited edition
now that I'm looking at so maybe that's
the only reason but even if it wasn't I
wonder if it'd be on sale because it's
just one of those things that you're
only gonna use it so often and you can
definitely find cheaper versions of
something like that I'm seeing a lot of
urban decay like a lot some of them are
limited edition like they're trouble
maker eyes shadow palette I didn't even
know that
I literally didn't even know that
existed it's on sale for 19 bucks but
also something that was part of their
regular line their Vice special-effects
long-lasting water-resistant lip topcoat
again one of those things that it's like
I don't know they're vise liquid
lipsticks are on sale for nine dollars
for a collection again with them being
the in-house brand you know I'm not
surprised that a lot of this you know
they kind of shuffle things out over
time just because you know if it's not
selling it's like well it's taking up
space especially like in the stores
let's just put it on sale get something
new in place things like that but it's a
lot of Sephora collection a lot of Urban
Decay one thing that's on sale is the
Kat Von D everlasting obsession lip
liner collector collector's edition it's
like all of her lip liners it was
originally $200 on sale 440 I can
imagine that there's not a lot of people
willing to spend $200 on a bunch of lip
liners obviously there are some people
and I'm sure some of you guys watching
this have bought this and the lip liners
are really really creamy they're good
lip liners so no shade on that it's just
the fact that it's so many and some of
them are like kind of blues and greens
and even if you do wear blue and green
lipstick in terms of time you're
probably not wearing it every single day
and so again it's like well considering
how much money you're spending wouldn't
it be better to just pick out three or
four shades from her line and buy those
instead of $200 for a bunch of shades
you're not gonna wear it's I mean I
guess it's all in your thought process
and what your taste is but I'm not
surprised to see that that's on sale
because I remember when that came out I
thought wow that's a lot of money but
wow you get a lot of product but you're
probably not gonna use all of those
shades so this is surprising the Marc
Jacobs remarkable full coverage
concealer no I have not tried this but
the reviews it's over four star reviews
and it's on sale for $22 that mean
they're not selling it at all was the
whole line discontinued cuz that's kind
of that's kind of surprising to me
considering that it has high reviews you
know what I mean but again I haven't
really heard anything about it so it
must just not be out there you know what
I mean I feel like things
get highly reviewed but if you're not
seeing it and you don't know it exists
you you probably aren't ever gonna buy
it and so maybe it was one of those
things but that's kind of interesting
the milk makeup holographic powder quad
this is on sale for $30 I own this it
just wasn't anything special I think a
lot of us are movie not everyone I know
but a lot of people are moving beyond
the holographic thing just to the next
thing that's how trends work that's you
know what I mean we people move on and
then you want the next big thing I think
they came a little late to the game
which is funny because milk makeups
whole thing like all of their packaging
is like I don't know if it's actually
holographic I don't know but whatever
that is they always have that kind of
packaging on their stuff so it's funny
that they're holographic powder quad
came so late in the game so I'm not
surprised again it was limited edition
I'm not surprised it's on sale even if
it weren't just because I remember I
swatch did I wore a few times I just
like it didn't really do anything like
it was a little bit glimmery it
certainly wasn't holographic I mean I
know that much but I mean it's I don't
know it just it just was not anything
especially even for $30 I couldn't
recommend that what the cap on D lock-it
brightening powders on sale this is $15
originally 25 oh it's only one shade so
it's for a tan deep skin tone well I
guess that's why if it didn't sell
enough of those they were just trying to
get rid of him so that's what I'm gonna
talk about there are tons of things in
the sale and what I realize this I've
clicked through some of them I get all
excited and I click on it I'm like oh
it's only like one shade cuz it must
have been one that maybe they're done
with the collection and they just need
to get rid of this last bit of stock
they have and some of them have click on
and they were out of stock on my ah darn
so I feel like that Sephora needs to do
a better job of like cleaning up their
sales section like I don't know who's in
charge of that Sephora whoever's in
charge of that online they need to like
get through and if it's sold out
get it off of there because it's
confusing us but let me know if you
enjoyed this video it was just for fun I
didn't really know if I would have
enough to say but I figured and we'll
give it a try but if you enjoyed I hope
you'll subscribe and give this video a
thumbs up and let me know what kinds of
videos you'd like me to film next and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
