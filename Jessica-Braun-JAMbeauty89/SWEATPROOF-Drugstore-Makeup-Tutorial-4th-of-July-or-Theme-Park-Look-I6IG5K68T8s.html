sweat-proof
go to look whether you went to a theme
park Disney a barbecue outside any
wherever you're going to be outside for
a while and you know you're going to be
sweating you know you're going to be in
the Sun these are all a collection of
products this is a look I'm going to do
with you today that is totally wonderful
in the Sun in the heat when you're
sweating now this is not makeup to go to
the pool and just start swimming with I
mean I've done a video on completely
waterproof makeup if you're interested I
will link it below where I literally get
in the shower and just let the water hit
me for a minute so that you can see that
all of it stayed it was amazing these
are all I would say pretty much
waterproof but definitely sweat proof
beautiful in the Sun I give a couple of
different options for different lips
different cheek products that depending
on what you like and all of this will be
linked below all of it is drugstore
except for one item I'll talk about at
the end all of its drugstore and they're
all just amazing amazing products if you
like this kind of video definitely give
it a thumbs up let us know below what
your sweat proof makeup product
recommendations are down in the comments
I hope that you'll subscribe while
you're here to catch more drugstore and
high-end makeup videos and let's go and
get into it started with some lip balm
this is the shea moisture shea butter
lip balm it's got african water mint and
ginger I love this stuff next up will be
SPF I'm using this B or a UV aqua rich
watery essence my friend Laura told me
about this and I tried it and I was like
what this is the best thinnest most like
matte SPF I've ever used it's so perfect
for the face you have to buy it on
Amazon cuz it is not in the States while
depending where you live I guess but I
got it on Amazon and it took a while to
get here you can pay a little bit more
to get it you can pay a little bit more
to get it quicker but anyway it's just
like it goes on so thin it does a great
job I wore this in Vegas when we're at a
pool we were outside a lot and I had no
color on my face which I appreciate but
it's just great and it sits really well
on our makeup it doesn't look weird and
that's why I like for me I'm like it is
worth paying a little bit extra to order
from far far away because it is that
good is that good and if I didn't
China has SPF of 50 so that's the wind
right there now that that has sunk in
pretty well the next step will be primer
so this is the NYX angel veil the reason
I wife use this when I need to be kind
of sweat proof whether it's at a theme
park or maybe it I don't know at a
barbecue and it's really hot outside
that you want to look full glam this is
going to be a look that's certainly more
makeup than anyone ever needs to wear
for something like that but like when I
met Disney for example I like wearing a
full face of makeup because we're
vlogging we're taking pictures you know
we're going to dinner and it's something
that a I don't want to have to touch it
up throughout the day but B I just like
okay nice so you know I'm on vacation
and I noticed for some people that means
taking a break from like doing their
daily stuff but to me I'm like oh I get
to wear makeup so I love it anyway so
that's on that I love because it really
stays in place all day and holds on to
any foundation you put on so the
foundation that I love that I feel is
very very budge proof is the number
seven stay perfect foundation it's got
medium coverage is a medium to high I
have to mix colors I have like six
shades now and none of them are quite
right so I'm mixing warm ivory and
calico but this I love that it has a
pump it just stays in place all day it's
got beautiful coverage so what I do is I
literally just mix it on my hand by the
way and then I'm going to use a sponge
and just don't wipe the extra off there
I'm using the flower Beauty sponge with
this just to kind of get it on
but this is really nicely atop the angel
veil primer tips nicely atop every
primer it's the best
but this flower beauty sponge by the way
is like the squishiest sponge I've ever
used in my life it is so good so you can
tell you can still see some life in your
skin which is why I love this foundation
so when you're in the Sun you don't look
all cakey and yet it's still really good
coverage and that is hard to find in a
foundation the concealer it was a total
toss-up for me I wanted to use concealer
that'd be good for a lot of you so it
still has pretty good coverage but it
stays in place this is not my favorite
concealer this is the NYX HD but when it
comes to longevity at the drugstore this
is my favorite so and actually I think
it's a little bit light for me right now
this is this isn't fair but that's okay
so I'm going to use that same sponge
just kind of a corner of it this one's a
little bit trickier to do up here but I
don't want to go too heavy on concealer
when I'm going to be in the Sun because
I feel like almost every concealer ends
up looking kind of cakey and just not as
flattering sometimes it can age you
prematurely prematurely because it's
kind of sunk into your fine lines so I
don't love going heavy on concealer when
I'm at a park if you want a
recommendation look one of my favorites
from the drugstore is from number 7 it's
their radiant glow concealer this is one
that really doesn't have high coverage
but it looks so nice and glowy and it
doesn't make you look older than you are
and so for me honestly this is great for
many many people but if it were just me
straight aboard of the park this is
typically I wear but I wanted to give
you guys a more a higher coverage option
if that's what you wanted but I'll link
both below I'll link everything I
mentioned below to get everything to
stay I like to set a lot of stuff so
this is the NYX HD finishing powder in
banana I like to use this on my under
eye just to set it in place no matter
which concealer I'm using because I do
feel like it helps with the longevity of
it all just kind of lightly you can use
loose powders too but I find that this
does just as nice of a job and it's less
messy and just really quick so one step
you could do if you are super oily is to
add the superstay better skin skin
transforming powder I love this stuff
I've had this one for a while it's
probably time for me to replace it but
it comes with a this is this
however I'd like to carry it around the
parks with me because or wherever I'm
just thinking dizzy in my head because
this is what I would do it's great
because I have a giant mirror it has a
sponge that's pretty decent and you can
really get some on the sponge and really
get some serious coverage so like if you
do end up sweating here and like the
makeup does rub off just give some of
this and kind of brush it into it and it
instantly kind of melds back into your
look this powder is really good I don't
know why more people aren't talking
about it but for this look today just to
hold everything in you could use this or
a loose powder now I I struggle to
recommend wearing a loose powder when
it's summering only because oftentimes
in the Sun you can just see it you know
what I mean any peach fuzz you have you
can see where that power is on your nose
but on the other side loose powder is
amazing at increasing the staying powder
power of your makeup period I mean it
can't be beat and so that's why I kind
of struggle between should use more of a
powder foundation kind of thing or a
loose so I would say it's totally up to
you
for me I would use loose powder more if
it's like maybe it's like the second
half of the day and we're going to go to
dinner and I really want to look nice
nice I would use loose powder and not
worry about what looks on the Sun but if
I know we're going to be pretty much
outside most of the day I would stick
with either no powder at all or you know
maybe more of a lighter one like this so
I'm going to use the superstay better
skin on this side just kind of setting
it a little bit holding it in place it
does add a little bit more coverage
especially if you use this sponge I'm
just using a big elf fluffy brush the
loose powder I would recommend to the
drugstore is from number seven it's the
translucent perfect light loose powder
this stuff is incredible I think this is
a lot better I like my NYC one and I
like the hard candy one is okay but this
one is better at not looking terrible in
the Sun so out of all the ones two drops
where this is my favorite so if you are
looking for one I would recommend this
one so now I am going to do all weight
on my brows let's go ahead and do
bronzer blush highlights so the bronzer
I would recommend is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster it's got a
bronzer a contour in like a lighter
shade you could totally use this to set
your under-eye
could use it to you know light in
certain areas of your face down your
nose whatever you want to do with it and
it actually adds a little bit of
coverage I've even used it down here and
I'll show you today to clean up this
area without using loose powder so let's
I don't typically contour just because
if I'm going to be in the Sun I don't
know but I will Bron so I'm using the or
bronzey shade over here and just a
smaller fluffy brush and I'm going to
kind of contour life with it it really
this really is pigmented but I do I love
how it stays in place all day I always
forget how pigmented this is well that
ever happens just bring your sponge back
into the game and kind of blend it back
out I'm going to go ahead and do my
blush now I have two options I have a
cream blush this is the NYX cream blush
in natural I also love the one in boho
chic I need to buy that again but I also
have a powder blush this is the flower
pots powder blush and sweet pea
I love these flower blushes again it's
another product that I'm like why is no
one talking about these these are crazy
pigmented they stay on all day really
cute packaging totally reminiscent of
the Milani ones like this this one's
smaller and thinner though what if
you're really wanting to have like crazy
longevity with your blush and stuff I
recommend putting on a cream and then a
powder on top we're going to do that
with our blush and probably with our
highlight as well so I'm going to use a
stipple brush it's a morphe one guys I'm
not an affiliate I also you want to say
that because I know what I hear people
talk about more feeling like no I'm not
an affiliate I know they have no idea
who I am so I'm just going to kind of
lightly get this cream on the apples of
my cheeks and back I love this so much
it can get really pigmented so I am kind
of dotting it off on a washcloth beneath
me just so it's not like clown pink but
you want to have a nice creamy base
because then I just blew on this film
area because then when you put a powder
on top it is going to stick to that and
just stay it's awesome so let's try the
flower beauty one again I'm tapping
extra off and just kind of lightly
dusting it on
out of that and you will see it will not
budge all right done it's not going to
move I'm telling you it is awesome it's
the same idea behind you know you put a
foundation on and then when you put
which is you know usually a cream type
formula and then when you put a powder
on top it holds it in place it's the
same thing with blush if you put a cream
blush on and then a powder one on top
it's going to hold it in place
this elf beautifully bear liquid
highlighter I love it's so simple the
packaging it's so simple and yet it's a
beautiful product now I also have my
powder highlighter this is the essence
pure nude so if you are worried about
how the Sun will affect how your makeup
looks like if you don't want to look
powdery I would say just do the cream
highlight because if you put powder
there and you're worried about that it
will end up picking up imperfections in
your face whereas the creamy one is a
lot less likely to do that just because
of its nature so I am going to use this
sponge just another part of it and I
kind of spread this out on my hand and
I'm just going to kind of lightly tap it
in that area oh my gosh it's so pretty
now you can already see the stripes so
what I typically will do there is go
back to the foundation part and just tap
it in so it's not being brought any
farther up or down it's just being kind
of pushed into the area and blended just
a little bit better isn't this so
beautiful okay other side get the tip of
my nose I love it I feel like this is so
like summery and glowy and just so
pretty and it's so so cheap like I said
I'll link all of this below if you are
more concerned with staying power than
how it looks in the Sun this would be a
time to grab a loose powder and power
your entire face your still going to be
able to see the shine come through but
it's really going to lock everything in
I'm going to show you I'm going to go
ahead and do that because I want you
guys to see what it looks like it
doesn't look about it so it's beautiful
but just keeping in mind how it might
look in the Sun okay so I'm going to use
a big old fluffy brush and I'm just
going to take some of this just tap it
into here you could use a velour puff
you could use so many a velour puff is
going to give you a more thorough
coverage I don't necessarily want that
but I do so
a lot on my brush I'm going to focus
most of it down there and then just
brush a little bit up same thing I'm
going to focus most of it down there and
then brush it up and so you can still
see the shine of the highlight it didn't
detract from that but it certainly
soaked up other oil but it's also really
holding on to the makeup again the
highlighter I would recommend for
longevity if you wanted a powder is this
essence pure nude highlighter it is so
cheap one of the most beautiful
highlighters I've ever use you can't
swatches don't really do it justice it's
so beautiful on I just don't think I
need any more highlight right now
alright let's move on to brows I have my
L'Oreal what do they actually call brow
stylist frame and set and I have it in
215 be brunette this for reference I
where the anasazi a dip brow pomade and
medium brown this is the closest I've
found and these I mean any of these brow
pomade
any of them NYX has one this L'Oreal one
of course Anasazi but that one's not
drugstore they all stay on all day you
don't have to worry about any of these
going anywhere that's why pomades are
the bomb it took me a long time to kind
of get on board with it but I feel like
now that I'm in the game I you know so
I'm just going to kind of brush through
my brows and
I don't think this one is as creamy and
easy to work with as Anasazi I'll tell
you that right now it still stays in
place so I mean if you're worried about
that more than anything
and it still looks good I don't think it
looks bad but it definitely does not
like blend as easily the Anasazi one
really is a league above but this is
still really good so to lock in and I
like to use the Milani brow shaping
clear gel it's this stuff is just great
I love the size of this bully it's just
a clear gel but it's really going to
lock in the shape of your brows which I
don't do this every day because my brows
aren't super bushy or anything but if
you do have beautiful thicker brow and
you want them to stay in place this is
great it's not as strong as the Anasazi
a clear gel but I think I like this
better only because it's a little bit
more natural looking okay so next is eye
primer I love the Milani eyeshadow
primer its touted on YouTube as one of
the best because it is one of the best
so just getting a little bit putting it
all the way from my the bottom of my lid
to the top right under my brow bone and
oftentimes a little bit it's still too
much this stuff is really it's a little
tiny bit goes a long way so I end up
wiping off a decent amount no matter how
many times I do it I still get too much
how's that possible but this stuff
really locks in your shadow so that it
doesn't move throughout the day it's
amazing for that so I'm torn as to what
drugstore palette to use I love my NYX
perfect filter palette these are so long
wearing beautiful shadows they have a
couple I want to get another as if I
need another palette but I want to get
other ones this ones in all of you and I
just love it but I've already done a
look with this on my channel I will link
that below so I'm thinking about going
with one of my Milani little watch look
I've done tons of Milani today but
they're so good this is the Milani
earthy element squad this one is must
have natural trying to think of what the
kinds of looks I do for a normal day in
the park I think leans more towards this
must-have natural so I think that's what
I'm going to use and I love this because
it has a matte black in it as well but
these shadows do such a great job of
staying in place all day so I'm going to
start with a fluffy brush and this kind
of neutral kind of not peachy
shade and I'm just going to put that
everywhere to kind of set that eye
primer and then I'm going to get a
thinner brush and you get this um kind
of deeper brown here and I'm going to
put that all over the lid as well I'm
just going to kind of give it into the
crease and onto the lid just kind of
cleaning up the edges with that light
shade again kind of helping to blend it
with that shade so now I'm going to take
this kind of middle shade here with my
finger I'm just going to tap it onto the
lid it's a beautiful shimmery shade and
I just think it looks so pretty on top
of that deeper Brown that we used
getting a little bit more of the dark
brown in the crease with the fluffier
brush and blending it out so I'm going
to use this kind of pretty white over
here with a flat brush and put it right
under the brow bone now this is totally
optional this is shimmery and I know
some people do not like Schurman that is
way too much Jessica said it oh my gosh
some people do not like shimmer on the
brow bone I think it looks so pretty so
for me I like it I don't think it's too
much
I mean I had a lot but it blended really
well I think it's just so pretty even in
the Sun I remember seeing someone we
were like in line somewhere at Disney
and I saw someone with you know that
under her brow and I was like oh my gosh
like it just looks so pretty I don't
know why do I remember that still isn't
that weird we also have this beautiful
like cream I'm going to put that right
in the center we're going to blend it
don't worry
so now we've used almost every shade
except for this black one so for me okay
this is going to be weird I sometimes
when I'm at a place like a park or a
barbecue where I know I'm going to be in
photos I like to go heavier on the
eyeliner because I feel like it looks
better in photos especially if they're
taking from far away because a more
subtle look on just a normal camera with
a bunch of prints doesn't come across as
nicely as it does when someone take a
picture takes a picture of it for
YouTube or Instagram you know so I'm
going to use kind of a pencil brush and
this black and it is a true matte black
and I'm going to kind of tight line my
eyes here on top and I'm also going to
bring it down below so I love my
favorite liner this waterproof is the
Milani stay-put waterproof eyeliner I
need to sharpen it this stuff is amazing
it's so creamy and I'm just going to
tightline with it it does not budge move
and I'm also going to go ahead I'm going
to clean it up don't worry I'm going to
put it in my lower waterline this is a
fantastic liner for this it just stays
in place it's so good and you know you
could toss it your bag if you're really
that concerned about it okay so the key
to eyeliner lasting all day no matter
what and I just do this every day of my
life unless I'm in a hurry
is to triple-layer so put on a nice
pencil liner then a gel a cream liner
then a liquid liner and that's what I'm
going to do so I'm going to use the
L'Oreal lacquer liner in blackest black
I love this stuff and that's going to go
on next and then I'll top it with a
liquid liner
now moving on to the liquid this is the
NYX epic ink liner it is the best the
best liquid liner at the drugstore
period I've never I have tried I swear
to you every single one out there this
is the one this is the best one
it's super black really easy to use and
it stays in place here's the last step
before lips and before I put on my
mascara I like to spray my face so this
is the Milani make it last setting spray
it's so good and I always shake it it's
a 16 hour wear I mean it's awesome it is
so good totally comparable to the
expensive versions but I like to spray
down before my mascara so I don't get
mascara all over the place ah it smells
does it this is a great way if you are
concerned about having powder this is a
great way to easily help the powder meld
into your skin so it's not as obvious
and it helps to stay longer they also
have a make it do a setting spray that I
have that I really like but I like to
make it last just a little bit better I
currently don't have any waterproof
mascaras on hand but if you know that
either your eyes kind of get watery or
maybe it's allergy season for you or
your going to be near a pool and you
might get splashed
I would use a waterproof mascara I don't
wear waterproof everyday because I when
I used to my eyelashes were falling out
and it would you know I couldn't decide
if it was how I was removing it or and I
would try so many different things and I
thought why am i doing this myself
just use regular mascara and I did and
once I found great regular mascaras I
didn't feel like I was missing out on
the waterproof the nice thing about
waterproof is they tend to hold the curl
really well but they're just I don't
know it was literally making my lashes
fall out and I was using it for years
and shows and things like that so I
finally found my favorite cosmetic
superhero you could totally do the lash
princess as well that is totally a dupe
the one I have currently is like done
like it is absolutely way too old to be
using and I didn't want to use just a
random other drugstore I wanted to show
you so this is the only product that is
not drugstore I'm so sorry but truly the
essence lash princess mascara I'll put
it on the screen right now and I will
link it below it's absolutely just as
good so just pretend I'm using that
because they really do end up having the
same look and they both last all day of
course you can get the waterproof
version of that if you really want to
I'm just going to use the regular I've
not noticed with this that I really
needed a waterproof version when I'm
sweating it's just something go anywhere
now if I were like straight up swimming
with mascara
well yes probably in ago but I never
noticed it running at all
I have two options for lips two
different sides of the spectrum if you
want to put on a lipstick that is not
going to move all day I would recommend
the wet and wild liquid cat suits now
these dry out your lips like every
liquid lipstick I've ever tried they dry
out your lips period so after a couple
of hours I would say maybe four hours
you're going to see some wear only on
the inside and maybe in the corners so
you might just put it in your purse or
whatever you're carrying around with you
and just reapply every few hours if
you're into that for me it's just too
uncomfortable especially if I'm sweating
it's hot whether I'm at a barbecue if
I'm eating I don't even want to think
about it so for me I'll slap on a lip
balm most of the time maybe a gloss but
if I want a little color I love these
now these are not going to not those
they will live but they're comfortable
and I can apply it again without a
mirror and if I'm about to eat I can
just wipe it off really quickly you know
with a napkin and not feel like it's
going to be all over my face or hard to
get off this is the Neutrogena oyster
smooth color smooth color stick I have
it in the shade pink nude you can put it
on I have lip balm on you can put it on
right on top it smells amazing it feels
good on the lips your lips aren't dying
at the end of the day I love it isn't it
just so pretty you didn't need liner you
didn't need gloss anything it's just
beautiful on its own they have a couple
different shades this is just my
favorite and I feel like I should have
done anything with my eyes that wouldn't
have mattered I could be wearing any
outfit and I can just throw it in my
purse now the only thing that would make
me nervous
is if it was maybe melt I think if
you're moving around going I don't think
it would mount but like if it's sitting
in your car I am sure
so hopefully you enjoyed this if you did
give it a thumbs up if you have other
video recommendations for me please let
me know down below if you yourself have
done a sweat proof video I also love to
see that let me know down below as well
otherwise I hope that you'll stick
around and catch some more of my videos
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
