reviewing a nail subscription box for
you but it's actually nail wraps and the
brand is called
scratch and I think they're websites
like go scratch it or something I'll
have the link below but if you're
interested it's $30 a month I was like
um but it's no roughs which I thought
was interesting because I'm assuming
there are some of you guys out there
that really like nail wraps now that's
something that's kind of unfamiliar
territory for me I've used them a couple
times and kind of hit or miss so I
thought this would just be interesting
to share with you guys for those that
are interested if you're not then you
might not want to watch a video because
that's what it's about but I figured I'd
show you anyway so scratch comes with
three different nail wraps and they're
all done by featured artists that they
find and they kind of do their own nail
there do their own artwork and they use
it on these nail wraps which i think is
a really cool and different idea and so
I'm excited to see I know it comes with
that it also comes with an a little
extra each month and then like tools so
we're gonna see what that means so I see
there's the thing with the artists here
huh I found the extra little sunglasses
those are kind of fun I'm you know like
cheapo ones but who cares we break it
loose sunglasses all the time it's got
the scratch brand there these are great
to just throw in your cars like a backup
pair in case you forget yours and the
Suns in your eyes where you trying to
drive also just in your beach bag like a
cheapo pair to keep in there so if they
break if you lose them so I'll that
we're gonna do love using sunglasses
like that for this so very cool I just
think that's fun and I see the tools
first of all there's this red tape and
it's in lipstick red at sets which I'm
assuming yeah it's just tape in there it
also comes with these little tiny gold
palm trees like two of them that you can
glue and I'm seeing the glue I'm also
seeing like a toothpick like tool here
now they did say um that they offer a
lot of tutorials on how to apply these
things which I think it's great
especially for someone like me who's
kind of a novice when it comes to nail
wraps and nail art I'm not it's not my
forte that's what I'll say so I thought
I mean when I do these I will be
watching tutorials on I am further
but okay so those are the tools that
came with it now the nail wraps there's
three different ones now this first one
is Shark Week inspired and they're kind
of cute some of them have little sharks
and some just have stripes and just boat
in a little anchor and polka dots but
this is by the artist Nina from Nina
nailed it so really really cute kind of
fun funky I'm excited to try these
actually the next one I'm seeing is by
Clara and she says she named this design
is Isabella's summer because it was
inspired by a client of hers named
Isabella and it's just got these cute
little flamingos and pineapples and palm
trees and things like that just really
cute so far I like these the best I just
like that and then the last one in here
is by Lynette Sanae I might have not
said that right but it's called here
comes the Sun and it's really cute it
has the words here come the Sun on it
it's just a bunch of summery thing some
little darling she's cute these are also
adorable oh and it also came at the
little nail file that was one of the
tools so for $30 you get a lot and if
you really I mean I guess if you think
about nail wraps they can be around ten
dollars sometimes more but if these are
really good quality then that would be
worth it for someone that does actually
buy nail wraps if this isn't really your
forte or if you're just on being into it
it probably wouldn't be worth it for you
so another thing to keep in mind but I
think it's cute and I'm excited to give
them a try and of course I'll keep you
guys updated on how I like them how they
stay on are they easy to apply you know
think all those little details that are
really important especially when you're
spending $30 on something like that so
hopefully that was helpful for you guys
I know that was quick but I'll get you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
