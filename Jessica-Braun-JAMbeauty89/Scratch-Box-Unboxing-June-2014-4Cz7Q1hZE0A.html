reviewing a nail subscription box for
you but it's actually nail wraps and the
brand is called scratch and I think
their websites like go scratch it or
something i'll have the link below but
if you're interested it's thirty dollars
a month I was like ooh um but it's new
reps which I thought was interesting
because I'm assuming there are some of
you guys out there that really like nail
wraps now that's something that's kind
of unfamiliar territory for me I've used
them a couple times and kind of hit or
miss so I thought this would just be
interesting to share with you guys for
those that are interested if you're not
then you might not want to watch a video
cuz that's what it's about but I figured
I'd show you anyway so scratch comes
with three different nail wraps and
they're all done by featured artists
that they find and they kind of do their
own nail they do their own artwork and
they use it on these nail reps which i
think is a really cool and different
idea and so I'm excited to see I know it
comes with that it also comes with an a
little extra each month and then like
tools so we're gonna see what that means
so I see there's the thing with the
artists here I found the extra little
sunglasses those are kind of fun I mean
they're like cheapo ones but who cares
we break it loose sunglasses all the
time it's got the scratch brand there
these are great to just throw in your
car is like a backup pair in case you
forget yours and the sun's in your eyes
where you trying to drive also just in
your beach bag like a cheapo pair to
keep in there so if they break if you
lose them so I'll that we're gonna do
love using sunglasses like that for this
so very cool i just think that's fun and
i see the tools first of all there's
this red tape and it's in lipstick red
it sets which i'm assuming yeah it's
just tape in there it also comes with
these little tiny gold palm trees like
two of them that you can glue and i'm
seeing the glue i'm also seeing like a
toothpick like tool here now they did
say on that they offer a lot of
tutorials on how to apply these things
which i think it's great especially for
someone like me who's kind of a novice
when it comes to nail wraps and nail art
I'm not it's not my forte that's what
I'll say so I thought I mean when I do
these uh I will be watching tutorials on
I am for sure
but ok so those are the tools that came
with it now the nail wraps there's three
different ones now this first one is
Shark Week inspired and they're kind of
cute some of them have little sharks and
some just have stripes and just boat in
a little anchor and polka dots but this
is by the artist Nina from Nina nailed
it so really really cute kind of fun
funky I'm excited to try these actually
the next one I'm seeing is by Clara and
she says she named this design is
Isabella's summer because it was
inspired by a client of her sing
Isabella and it's just got these cute
little flamingos and pineapples and palm
trees and things like that just really
cute so far I like these the best I just
like that and then the last one in here
is by lynette Sanae I might have not
said that right but it's called here
comes the sun and its really cute it has
the words here come the Sun on it it's
just a bunch of summary thing some
little darling she's cute these are also
adorable oh and it also came with a
little nail file that was one of the
tools so for thirty dollars you get a
lot and if you really i mean i guess if
you think about nail wraps they can be
around ten dollars sometimes more but if
these are really good qualities and that
would be worth it for someone that does
actually buy nail wraps if this isn't
really your forte or if you're just on
being into it it probably wouldn't be
worth it for you so another thing to
keep in mind but I think it's cute and
I'm excited to give them a try and of
course I'll keep you guys updated on how
I like them how they stay on are they
easy to apply you know think all those
little details that are really important
especially when you're spending thirty
dollars on something like that so
hopefully that was helpful for you guys
I know that was quick but i'll catch you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
