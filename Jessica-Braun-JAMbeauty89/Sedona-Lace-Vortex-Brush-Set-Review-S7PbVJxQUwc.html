review for you guys of another brush set
now I previously reviewed some brushes
from diva beauty and some from Altair
beauty and you can I can like those two
videos below out of those two
I loved the diva Beauty brushes so much
and like I said in that video I'm a
Sigma affiliate and I love Sigma brushes
but the diva Beauty brushes are better
so this is a Sedona lace kit and they
sent me this vortex brush kit to review
for you guys and as always I'm always
honest whether it's sent to me or not
how I feel about them so there are some
great pros and there are a few cons so
in the kit there are four face brushes
eight eye brushes in one lip brush so
let's go ahead and dig in one of the
brushes and the main reason I was
excited to get this kit in particular is
the fan brush it is a humongous brush
really thick really just luxurious
feeling and I got it for the purpose of
highlighting and I have to admit I've
actually used it more for contouring
that I have for highlighting but you can
really use it in any way you want and
the whole purpose from my understanding
the whole purpose of this kit is kind of
to fill in the voids and the gaps
between when it comes to brush kits cuz
most brush sets come with the typical
powder powder brush blush brush you know
etc this one kind of fills in the gaps
and you'll see what I mean so this one I
was really excited to get the only
famish I've ever owned before this was
the elf one and it's really really thin
and it's not bad I mean it's still soft
but this is just so thick and if you
just get a little bit of highlight or a
little bit of bronze or whatever on it
it just so flawlessly applies that I
love it so and they all come with like
little guards and this one they say to
keep on it while you're storing it just
to keep its shape but I've washed all of
these and most of these were fine after
the wash except for like one or two
brushes and I'll tell you which ones so
another face brush it comes with is this
one it's the FBO 5 and I use this
there's product on it I've used this
actually for powder foundation like if I
just need a little more coverage here
and I've already
my liquid foundation I'll dip this in a
powder foundation like the Knicks stay
matte but not flat one or the laura
geller balance and brighten and I'll
just dip it in there and just kind of
swirl it there and it just applies it
really really nicely
it doesn't look cakey but you can use
this for contour which i think is maybe
what it's marketed to do I'm not sure
you can use it for anything for
highlight for you powder and your
under-eye really anything you want but
it's a nice one else sells one that's
really comparable to this one and I
would say either of those are nice the
other thing it came with is their FB o7
brush which I have been using this for
my liquid foundation most notably with
my what do I like this with my Revlon
Colorstay it's not as it's insanely soft
all of these brushes are super super
soft but it's not as dense as the Sigma
f80 just the f80 is that the one I can't
think of which one others it's not as
dense so I use my Sigma f80 when it
comes to like a mousse foundation like
my the Colorstay whipped I use the Sigma
one with any of my liquid ones I use
this one it works better but I don't
find that this one works as well with a
thicker foundation so that's something
you know to keep in mind my hair is a
mess this it's been quite a week we had
a garage sale here at my house recently
and my allergies are really really bad
right now and I swear to you no medicine
works on them anyway but and I was just
like a stupid rotten mess like my eyes
were red and itchy I couldn't stop
sneezing my nose is runny I literally
felt like I just wanted to immerse
myself under water and just sit there
for a while because it was just so itchy
and if you have allergies you know
exactly I mean there's nothing worse
there was no point to that story except
for this is my natural hair because I
wanted to
usually shower in the morning but I was
like you know what I'm getting all of
this pollen and all this nonsense off of
me so I showered last night and went to
my went to bed with my hair wet and this
is
naturally energized anyway Wow that
nothing is a day so I really do like
this brush oh that's really really soft
the other face brush is the FBO 3 this
is amazing this is a brush when I saw it
I was like I wonder how I'll use that
like I wasn't really sure how I
personally would use it I have been
using this non-stop for blush and what's
so bizarre about it is that point ends
up being perfect cuz you can kind of
point it right there and just sweep your
blush back and it is so nice I just love
this it's it's tapered it's perfect I
it's so bizarre because I never would
have thought I'd use a brush like this
for blush but I can't stop using it it's
the one I reach for every single day so
next we'll go ahead and talk about the
one lip brush it comes it's like a
little capped one and it's there lb 25
and basically you can take the back of
it and stick it on and it's just a lip
brush I've used it once I don't really
use lip brushes ever I don't have potted
lipstick really you know so I've used it
once but again it's nice to have a nice
lip brush for when I need it but I don't
use it often but I like that it is
capped that way if you can't clean it
off in time you know so onto the eye
brushes let's start with this eyebrow
brush it's the EB 17 it's very
comparable to the Anastacio duo one
where it's got the angled brush on one
side and the spoolie on the other I
really like it this bully's great and
dense which is exactly what I personally
want when I'm doing my brows and this
one is this is the thickest little brush
I've ever used and it works so well with
brow powder so well now you guys know
that lately I've been using the brow Wiz
so I've used this side more but I did
intentionally try the brow powder again
a few times with this and it really does
apply really well alright next we've got
this one that I haven't gotten as much
use out of its the EB 19 it's like a
thin liner brush I don't use this kind
of brush for a cream eyeliner I use
cream eyeliner all the time but I use
I'll show you which one I use I use the
EB 23 which is another angled brush but
I have been loving it's a little black
because it still has some of my liner on
it
I've been using this so much it works
really well creating a little bit of a
wing if you
to go out just a little bit it's just I
really love the angled one this one if
you like this kind of brush you can kind
of see I don't know if it's showing up
but a little bit of the hairs have
frayed there after I washed it so that
was one that didn't wash quite as well
which is a shame but I love the angled
one and then it also comes with the EB
21 I've been using this for what did I
use this for Oh
for getting a little bit in my outer
corner here just right there little
darker color can be really really
precise with it and then blend it out
with a fluffier brush like this one this
one has gotten a lot of use the EB 13 it
has a really fluffy end and I really
have been using this a ton for just
blending everything together for getting
a little bit of a buffer shade there I
just love this and speaking of buffer
shades this is the EB 15 and it's kind
of a tapered end there and this is great
again for getting right in that crease
because it's tapered and pointed you can
be precise but it's also fluffy enough
toward the bottom that you can really
kind of if you've got a medium shade
that you're wanting to get all over the
place it works really well at blending
that together too but this is another
one that didn't wash so well and a lot
of the hairs are falling off I've seen a
lot just like fall wow wow I'm using it
so that was a bummer because I really
like the shape of this but I really this
and that little tiny liner brush it the
only ones I noticed that after I washed
them they are losing hairs or it's
messed up all the other ones were fine
so it might just be those two or just
loops this one I love it's the Evo 9 and
I have been using this like crazy to
pack color onto my lid here and even up
here but I'll show you what else I've
been using for up there but it's just
perfect I mean it this is kind of a
brush that you can really go any brand
and find a good one but I like it it's
really great and the last one is the EB
11 and this is one that's kind of that
certain feeling I can't think of what
that texture is but it's got that kind
of glossy feeling to it and but I've
been using this and but too many
contractions conjunctions conjunctions
this is one that I've been using with
powder shadow just to get right under my
brow bone with like a nice light shade
so it just it works really well because
of the shape you can really get right in
there your arch or whatever you whatever
shape you got going on up there ladies
and I really really like it so all in
all this brush kit is expensive they do
sell these brushes individually as well
and fiber to recommend a few
individually I really would recommend
the FBO three that blush because I've
never seen a brush quite like this in
any other line and I just really like it
I can't stop using it and so that would
be one if you're looking at maybe just
buy one nice brush or a couple this is
one I would recommend the fan brush you
just can't lose with I again haven't
seen one like this anywhere else and
it's just so thick and luxurious it's
just one of those you just feel gorgeous
using it you know what I mean so so far
those two out of their eye brushes I I
think if I were to just recommend one
because they're all really good but you
can find similar ones and other lines as
well I really do like the EB 13 it's
just it's really fluffy it works so well
at blending and I just really like it
and it's a little denser than most eye
shadow brushes this shape which I liked
so that would be another one I recommend
but really the kit is really nice and if
you're someone that's looking to get
brushes that aren't in a normal brush
kit this would be a great one for you if
you've got the money to spend or maybe
you're a makeup artist and you want some
different options for brushes I don't
know this would be a great kit for you
because it does fill in that gap of the
brushes you don't most don't come with a
jumbo fan brush and you know all those
kinds of things so but I hope that was
helpful for you guys like I said I'll
list those other brush videos below the
diva brushes they're a little bit
cheaper they also don't have as many
options so you know that's another thing
to think about and of course I'll lick
link the altaïr brush kit below as well
which is very different from this so I
hope that was helpful I'll catch you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
