to talk about Sephora bestsellers this
is literally if you go to Sephora and
you look at their you click makeup and
then you click bestsellers I went
through the whole list and these are
bestsellers that I didn't like I've
tried them some many most of them I've
decluttered but all of these are
products that I just didn't like now
there's varying reasons why I'll try to
be as thorough as I can in here
obviously if people like these products
that they're on the best sellers list
not only are people buying them but
other people are recommending them
people like them so I know this might
rel pull some feathers but hopefully
we're all mature enough to know that we
all have different opinions and that
doesn't change your opinion you know
what I mean so I saw Lisa Stevens do
this here on YouTube I will link her
video below that's what inspired me to
do my own version I mean it's the same
video but my product side to clip anyway
uh-huh
but I really trust her opinion because
she worked at Sephora so it was very
illuminating to watch her so you should
definitely check herself anyway let's go
ahead an get into it so the first
product is the hee Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation I don't know what it was
about this but what I remembered and Too
Faced had sent me a bunch of these
shades if I'm remembering correctly I
didn't buy it no they definitely said it
and I ended up decluttering all of them
over you know that the course of that
year because I felt like it was just
kind of subpar I didn't think it was bad
like it wasn't something that I put on
and thought oh my gosh this looks
terrible like some foundations I tried
it was just one of those things that was
like this really isn't worth the price
point so I didn't really want to highly
recommend it cuz I didn't think it was
anything special so I know a lot of
people like it and the reality is if I
wasn't a youtuber with tons of makeup
what I have kept it and probably used it
all sure because it wasn't bad but I
just didn't feel like that strongly
about it and for that reason I just like
yeah I remember it kind of illuminated
some dry patches and that was one that's
one just big no-no for me I'm like nope
because I know there's other things out
there that don't do that
so next one is the Kat Von D lock-it
foundation this one will be brief it was
just way too drying for my skin way too
trying most high coverage foundations I
just can't do with my dry skin and I
know a lot of you dry skin gals out
there feel
you know there are some things you can
do to make it better so you could put
you know a facial oil underneath and
that does help really good moisturizer a
moisturizing primer but at the end of
the day if I'm looking in the mirror
it's like literally at the end of the
day and I look at my skin's all cracked
I'm like why am i doing that I'm not I
don't have that much to cover why am i
putting on this high of a coverage
foundation when it's just making my skin
look worse than it did before sure it
might not be as red but now it just
looks dry crepey and old so it's like
you're I'm kind of picking my battles
here and I would rather have maybe a
little bit of redness show through but
my skin looks healthy and glowy versus
high high coverage that looks great from
a distance but in real life it just
looks like a mess what do they say in
clueless she's like a Monet like you
know from far away she looks all right
but from up close it's just such a big
mess another ID cluttered in cosmetics
CC plus illumination I love their CC
cream I've been wearing it in light I
think I need to go a shade down to fair
right now cuz the light is way too dark
for me but the one with illumination I
tried to make work I've tried to even
mix it with the regular one thinking
maybe it'll balance it out it's it's way
too glowy
like shimmery glowy and it's to that
point where every time I'd look in the
mirror like this is too much and like
I'd put a bunch of powder on top and it
would help but I'm like I don't even
have Whaley's skin and it's making me
look like I have oily skin so I could
only imagine for someone that has a
really skin how ridiculous it might look
so that's just kind of my take on it I
do however like the cosmetics CC it's
like their celebration foundation
illumination I like the illuminating
version of the powder but I don't like
the illuminating version of the actual
CC cream The Naked heat the Urban Decay
Naked heat palette I got rid of that I
gave it to my friend because it was one
of those things that again they sent it
to me and I'm all excited and I opened
it like wow the packaging is beautiful I
mean look at it it's just so pretty the
colors super warm tones really really
pigmented but it is one of those things
I'm like it's almost too much for me I
could get like one kind of everyday look
and all the rest for really fiery looks
and while I do like doing that
time to time I knew I knew in my heart
that I wouldn't get very much use out of
it I'd much prefer a warm tone palette
that maybe has a few more wearable of
course that's my opinion wearable but
more like everyday kind of neutral
colors mixed in with it and obviously
that's not the point of that palette the
point of that palette is you know it's
naked heat but I just knew it wasn't my
cup of tea and so I just passed it on
again it's one of those palettes that
yes it's good quality you need to look
at it and be like am i buying it just
because it's new and exciting or am i
buying it because I'll actually use it
because you need to kind of you know you
know yourself better than anyone just
get inside that brain of yours and think
why am i buying this
next is the oh I might still have this
one hold on I do not so in fact I
actually have decluttered every single
one of these it is the beca prismatic
amethyst highlighter this I thought was
limited edition maybe it still is but
it's been around for a while so maybe
it's not but I bought it back when it
first came out maybe a year or so ago
and it's got this kind of purple hue to
it that can look beautiful on different
skin tones it just doesn't look good on
mine I wore it a few times and every
time I look at the mirror I'm like it's
just like like it just didn't quite mesh
right with my skin tone and I did feel
like that one was just a little bit
grittier than the other Becca
highlighters I've tried and for that
reason - I was like it is it grittier
because it's like limited edition
they're just not putting as much like
good quality ingredients in it is that a
thing I feel like that's a thing or is
it because of the color like it had to
have certain I don't know regardless I
just felt it was a little grittier it
didn't look natural on my skin and the
way I like it - or at least it didn't
mesh into my skin I know a lot of people
love it so it's kind of again it's a
your cup of tea kind of a thing another
is the Make Up For Ever HD stick this is
a stick foundation I I really like the
hourglass vanish foundation that's also
one of the bestsellers but this one the
makeup forever it was just a little bit
dry on my skin and I felt like every
time I blend it no matter how I was
doing it it would just kind of pull up
those those dry skin parts that I had on
my skin and it
just did not look flattering no matter
what I had underneath it now I was
talking to my friend Laura about it
because she absolutely adores that stuff
and she said that she used this so
little like so little I'm like well
maybe maybe I was using too much that
very well could be so if I still had it
I'd kind of try it again but you know
that's kind of my two cents again dry
skin kind of a thing that's really I'm
kind of realizing as I'm saying all this
out loud I'm like Jessica it sounds like
a lot of these are just products that
you didn't like because of your skin
tone or skin type and so I hope this is
still I've got a few more products
mentioned but I hope this is still
helpful for those of you that you have a
different skin type so maybe if I'm
saying it's too dry for me and but you
have oily skin then maybe it would be
great for you you know what I mean so I
hope this is still a helpful video I
don't know anyway okay another one is
the Tom Ford quads I've only tried one
and it's the one in orchid haze this was
terrible I returned this one I was so
upset because these pallets are freaking
expensive these quads and I do want to
try one more just for the sake of my
channel I hate that I'm having to say
that I hated this time for quad but it
was horrendous no pigmentation I
literally could not believe it I kept
looking like is this authentic but yeah
I ordered it from Sephora's website it
was crazy I so I've never been so
disappointed in something like ever
anyway but I want to try the one in
golden mink or Coco Mirage because I've
heard those two are so gorgeous so if
you know which one of those two you'd
recommend like for me if you know me you
know what I mean let me know below
because I do want to buy one more and
make sure maybe it's just that one quad
maybe it is or have you tried other
quads of his and you're like no this one
is also terrible because they do have
you know like seven or eight options
okay another one I didn't like I
remember buying this at Sephora and like
trying to color match myself um it's the
Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour full
coverage foundation it was a very thick
foundation you squeeze it out it's very
very thick and it just I tried it with a
brush a blender everything fingers and
it just was too much I think it was it
looked very very fake in every lighting
I tried it in and you know it was a
little bit drying but it wasn't the
worst worse it was just an
every lighting it just looks so fake and
it wasn't fake like in a perfected way
it was more fake like Anna ooh does she
know what she's doing kind of away
something cents I don't know so I that
one I ended up decluttering as well so
if you would like to see the opposite of
this video sephora bestsellers that i
absolutely love and recommend let me
know because i was looking that list I'm
like dude I've tried almost every single
one of these products so let me know I
would love to film that as well and then
with most of those I still have them so
I could actually swatch them show them
to you things like that so let me know
if you'd be interested in that and I
hope you enjoy it and that you'll
subscribe before you leave and I'll see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
