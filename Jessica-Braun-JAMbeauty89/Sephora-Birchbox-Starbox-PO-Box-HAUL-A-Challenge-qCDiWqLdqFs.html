have just a random video I wasn't gonna
film today and I thought you know what I
have a little while and I've been trying
now that I'm done with student teaching
and I'm kind of into my summer and I've
got a lot more free time I'm trying to
put up more videos cuz really I do it I
don't have a schedule and I don't think
I ever will just because I don't want to
feel that pressure because this is
something I enjoy and I think if I put
that much pressure on it it won't be as
enjoyable it'll feel more like work and
I really love doing this obviously why
else what I've started doing it but um
but I also want to put up more content
for you guys obviously cuz you guys are
a big part of the reason that I'm here
and that I still enjoy doing it so that
being said while I don't really have a
schedule and probably never will I do
want to put out more for you guys so I
had kind of a sprinkling of things that
I recently either received or bought and
I figured you know what I'll just kind
of make a kind of a mini haul peel box
um kind of thing you guys will see so
we'll just see how this goes so the
first thing that I'm the most excited
and that I was the most touched by was
this girl Lily and her mother
they both watched my videos and so
they're from Australia and they sent me
a package and actually I think this
package is from Lily who is 12 so Lily I
know you're watching I'm very excited so
this is how came and this is my very
first package from Australia so very
excited let's see if there's you see
something in here but I want to see if
there's like a letter or something first
oh okay there's first of all a picture
Thank You Lily this is so cute just in
time for Easter to Easter just happened
that's so cute and a little better ooh
little you have nice handwriting Oh
awesome she said she sent some gifts
that are specifically from her home in
Australia awesome oh my gosh
Lily this is so sweet I'm so excited
okay so the first thing is she mentioned
this in her
there is a little wombat she said that
this is her favorite animal and this is
absolutely adorable what's so funny
this looks like my pug of course a pug
is a dog but he's really really chunky
and like kind of low to the ground like
this little wombat is I'll have to if I
can't all insert a picture of him right
now he's totally totally chunks turd
just like this little guy is that is
adorable I love it I will cherish this
I'm gonna stand next to my little Minnie
Mouse that another subscriber of mine
sent to me and I can just be little
bunnies over there another okay so this
is really cool and she also mentioned
this a coin from where she lives
um in the Hunter Valley I can't say the
next it says knock your chest knock I'm
not sure CES s nos DK just a little coin
that's so cool this is so cool because
I'm getting to a Canadian subscriber
mine sent me some stuff and she sent me
socks and I cherished those socks it's
just so fun to get little things from
around the world because you know I will
eventually travel and that's one of my
favourite things to do but I haven't
gotten to travel that far and yet so
that's really exciting and then she sent
me this blush essence beauty beats this
is in the shade groupie at heart it's a
really really pretty color oh yeah and
everything I've ever tried from essence
I have loved and they don't have as much
of an essence selection here so oh my
gosh really excited it looks like these
are both eyeshadows from essence we've
got um I'm backstage and go glam is this
purple one these are beautiful and I
don't think I'd have shadows like these
at all so I'm really really excited
Oh Lily thank you so much and thanks to
your mom too because this is just I was
so excited when I saw this in my peel
box and and again you're my very first
person to send me sent from Australia so
it's very exciting anyway okay so that
was just so sweet and so awesome and by
the way the way that I've been
conversing with lily and her mom has
been on Twitter so if you guys don't
follow me on there there's certainly
links below always to my Twitter and
Instagram but I love Twitter because I
can really converse with you guys a lot
more so than I do on here I try and you
know I'll sit down
respond to comments but you'll see maybe
on one video I haven't because I just
been busy when I uploaded it but I did
on the next one you know and so it's
really kind of hard to keep track of and
it's not as easy to reply like on my
iPad or on my phone whereas with Twitter
and Instagram it's really easy for me
especially on Twitter to interact with
you guys so I definitely do a lot more
interaction on there than I do on here
unfortunately so definitely if you have
a Twitter and Instagram follow me on
those I would love to be chatting with
you ladies anyway okay so I also got the
star looks star box for this month I
don't think it's April I think it's the
May one although I got it a week ago but
I think it's still de meillan I guess
we're about to find out
thanks April it's the April sunrooms
here's the little car that comes with it
as usual it says that this star box
retail value is $51 and this cost $15 to
5 so it looks like there's three things
in this one and that's the thing about
Starbucks it really does run the gamut
they you know sometimes it'll be four
things in it sometimes they'll be two
sometimes it'll just be a big pallet and
that'll be it but the price value is
usually worth it so that you know what I
mean so I'll start with this smaller
thing what is dish says the color is
pout it's a lip gloss I've been kind of
going through my lip glosses and getting
rid of some older one so I'm excited to
get some new ones oh my gosh look at the
color of this I'm trying to see if it
focus to your theory pekin that is so
gorgeous oh my gosh so this is in the
shade pout I'm certainly gonna swatch it
for you oh my gosh that is absolutely
stunning okay good job good job star
looks because this is my favorite lip
product new scent I can already tell I
don't think it has a smell at all let me
double check again because sometimes I
hope it's like a vanilla I love no
really no sin at all which is nice right
now I'm wearing a NYX gloss and it has
that cherry scent and I'm still not a
big fan of it the Lighting's kind of
weird is it not maybe it's not I don't
know anyway hey guys I remembered
something to wipe my swatches off
Gomi they never remember okay next thing
is a way bigger thing this is a five pan
shadow palette but does it have a name
no it the Tokyo collection look at these
colors these are stunning okay let's see
if I can do a little swatch Arun oh okay
well just upon first swatches
they didn't swatch perfectly but I
wasn't really pressing but they're
really pretty colors I think that
they're the palette that I got the New
Year's Eve 2014 palette or whatever it
actually has a new name and they're
selling it again on their site so if I
can wear the name I'll write it below if
you guys know what some of you guys were
the ones that told me about but anyway
um I think this is not as pigmented as
the that palette but they're still
really pretty colors and again more
colors that I don't have yet which I
really really appreciate and I think
their theme was like spring and kind of
flowers and that's certainly a floral
type palette even though it's called
Tokyo anyway and then flour mix very
interesting that's cute um so I don't
think this month was my favorite month
but I have to admit that this is my
favorite lip product so I'm really
really really really excited about that
and I think I'll still get use out of
that eye shadow palette specially since
those colors I don't have so I can get a
little funky so yay next thing I need
your guys's help because I bought the
you guys know I'm a cheapskate so when I
buy something like expensive
it better be freaking awesome or I'm
gonna return it this is the hourglass
ambient lighting palette and herb just
powder just one there's just one and
it's in diffused light now it's this you
know seemingly super light powder but I
was reading reviews and this is one
that's not you can't see it this is one
that's not in the actual ambient
lighting palette that has the three
different shades this one's not in its
called diffuse light and I thought it
would be similar to dim light but I had
read reviews that for really fair
skinned gals even dim light is a little
you know most people
use that as kind of a finishing powder
which is what I wanted one of these for
not for a highlight or illumination but
just kind of as a glowy finishing powder
for all of the face
so dim light some fair-skinned people
were saying that it was almost too dark
and I was like and it's not a dark
powder at all but it was just that
little bit that have kind of turned a
little dark so I thought this would be a
better option for me however I don't
think it's doing much I'm wearing it
today
I don't think it's doing much by way of
anything I don't know you guys tell me
you guys are looking at my skin I don't
know is it worth it should I return it
the other thought is the ambient
lighting palette is I think a little
over $50 and this was like 45 or maybe
this was 38 and that was 45 the
difference was less than $10 between
getting the palette with three suckers
in it or just one but since this one
wasn't in it I wanted to get this one
but if I'm not loving it maybe I should
return it and get the palette and then
just have the options what do you guys
think I should do if your favorite skin
like me and you've tried the dim light
one does it work is it too dark how is
it finishing I know everyone loves it
but yeah I don't know I don't know I was
really kind of hmm maybe I should wear
it some I just don't know I really don't
but that's a lot of money and you guys
I'm not made of money here okay by the
way I got my hair cut it's still kind of
wet don't judge me
I've got to run a bunch of errands today
and I was in a rush but I did one of
films videos so it's still kind of wet
but it did they chopped off about this
much but it feels good and healthier but
like sweat and then it's still wet and I
feel just kind of today
okay so agave oil sent me this trio and
a beautiful packaging as you can see and
I was really excited because it came
with a shampoo and conditioner which are
these little puppies right here and then
it also came with the thing I was the
most excited about which is the agave
healing oil and this stuff smells
amazing all three of the products smell
absolutely amazing and I love the
packaging on this that it is like a
medicine dropper you know I just I think
that's really convenient however I have
noticed that it'll drip down the side of
my and I if you haven't noticed I keep
all my products in like pristine
condition because that's just the way I
am I like to get too messy I clean up
Dolf that sound stupid I know but I do
it and I bet I'm not the only one anyway
but I've used this a couple of times and
I'll do a separate video I've really
been liking this but especially this
this is the standout product and I know
they sell this in quite a few stores so
I can put a link below for it but I've
really been liking it I'll do another
review I'm really interested in their
they have their straightener I saw
Melissa Prado I loved here on YouTube
that she had the straightener that's got
like this vapor that you put the oil in
it and it like vapors through your hairs
are straightening I thought that is
crazy awesome and I don't straighten my
hair that often but I mind if I got
something like that I mean that sounds
awesome and it just sounds like it's
really good for your hair
I don't know so really excited to do a
review on that for you guys
the last thing I'll talk about is I
place an order with Birchbox not their
Birchbox subscription service because
you guys know I canceled that sucker but
they have really good when you order
products from them they have really good
like perks for example you can get
points for when you buy stuff and then
you can put those points towards your
next purchase but which is like support
or anything like that
but they have this bonus shop and you
can get all kinds of free stuff like you
spend $20 you can get this like they
have a clear acrylic organizer tray you
get for free I'm like what oh we're like
four you'll see one of the free things I
got with this for placing a smash
buckler so a lot of sites have that but
I really I feel like Birchbox has more
to offer so been love being that anyway
so I just literally got this in the mail
today
the first thing I got was this junior
Watkins foot repair sal and it's just a
little tin actually i am gonna open this
because I'm curious about the texture of
this I love Jerry Watkins products oh
it's got this peppermint but you know
and the oh oh yeah it's just a salad but
it's a little creamier than I expected
I'm sure you can't really see that but
you know in the summer time when you're
wearing sandals more your feet get more
dried out and that's how
in the winter might be have no problems
cuz they're all snug and cozy and my
socks and boots but in the winter boy so
I'm really excited I haven't tried any
products like this but I love I have the
junior Watkins spray for your like sore
muscles and I love it and again it's got
that peppermint I'm assuming peppermint
oil or something like that but I'm
really excited to give this a try
because I have loved their products for
a long time another thing I finally gave
in and got was the benefit gimme brow
and I got it in light to medium and I'm
really excited because if you guys
watched my I think it was in my ELF
video that I showed they have an elf
colored or tinted brow gel and the color
is actually pretty good but the spoolie
is way too long and I said I really want
one like gimme brow it's just this
really tiny little thing it's so cute
let's look at this sucker oh my gosh are
you kidding look how adorable small I
love it
so I'm really excited I want to see the
coloring on this though it does look
really light and I almost got the darker
one no that's gonna be perfect actually
I love it seems that it doesn't pull red
at all and it just seems like it'll make
everything way easier if I don't want to
use a pencil if I don't want to use a
powder we'll see how this does on its
own I don't know I'm you guys know I'm
weird about my brows but I'm really
excited to give this a try and finally
get it I have not you guys have asked me
if I finally cuz I mentioned that I
would cut the elf one that's way too
long that I was gonna cut it to make it
small like this and I tried with regular
scissors and of course it did not work
because there's like some sort of
freaking heavy duty wiring in that
sucker so I need to get the proper kinds
of things to cut it but I still even to
try that will let you guys know how that
goes if you have tried it let me know if
it worked for you and yes so next oh
okay this was a big purchase but I did
have some like rewards points on there
so I didn't end up really paying paying
for this which is always nice ant and
actually this is interesting
Birchbox I have to give them kudos
because they had screwed up and ordered
so mean they screwed it up I place his
order for like a Jew a Matt
bronzor it was like a full-sized thing
it was laying $16 I was like this can't
be right
place order because I was like this kid
this must be a mistake but I'm like I'm
placing it that way I can say hey it was
listed on your site and you guys owe it
to me I mean anyway so I ordered it
along with something else that I got the
other thing but that didn't come in like
so of course I contacted customers
there's a nice way and they were saying
oh my gosh we're so sorry like it was
backordered or there was a mistake so I
keep getting emails and they've like
four different times put like a hundred
points into my account which is
equivalent to ten bucks so I ended up
with like 40 or 50 dollars in rewards
points all because they screwed up my
order and I think they're still gonna
send it to me but it's like on backorder
so they keep saying sorry and here's 100
points sorry and then I got another
email saying 100 points for a refund and
then I got my refund in points and then
like all kinds of points like all right
calm down Xbox I mean you can keep
giving points but it's okay it's alright
we're still cool but I spent it on this
little buddy the Smashbox full exposure
palette I heard mixed reviews about it
but I love the colors and I was like I
want to trick myself if I don't like it
I can always return it I know that so I
figured because I just love love love
the colors in this and for me it I was
thinking about the lorac Pro palette but
it wasn't on there first of all if they
don't sell the rock yet on Birchbox can
I get this little buddy out and I like
Smashbox and every time I own a special
try it well that's not true because
their liner I hate it anyway so this is
what it looks like really really kid and
pretty I'm so excited
look at these oh my gosh these are
beautiful they have shimmer on the top
how many shadows is that seven and then
seven matte ones on the bottom
oh my goodness I really am it's just
okay but I've heard that the shimmery
ones aren't as well I like that one and
that one
these are gorgeous
what were people complaining about ooh
those are party they have it split up
not only Matt shimmer but they have
warmer tones here on this side and then
like like whites if you will and then
cooler tones I just think that's so
genius here's kind of some of the matte
shades there I I'm just really excited I
can already tell you I'm going to love
it and I just love that for when I'm
traveling I can have shimmery and matte
all together same like with the lorac
Pro but I'm really excited to have both
options it's a little thicker than I
envisioned though not that's a problem
but it comes with a brush a dual ended
brush ooh oh and it actually says let me
make sure it's not upside down for you
guys it actually says shimmer and matte
on the thing but I like that this is
more pointed and this is more flattened
that's actually it feels low mate to the
brush so I like that because the naked
one at Naked 2 brushes I hate hey hey
hey hey they're just boyfriend hey okay
well let me tell you this and I want to
give you guys a challenge because I'm
just thinking about this and I want to
mention it to you guys so it comes with
the Smashbox full exposure mascara
we'll see if I keep this I've tried it
before it didn't love it so I might give
this to a sister a friend or sell it and
then the free thing I got was the
Smashbox photo finish primer which is
one of my favorite primers and it takes
me forever to go through this so this
was free on Birchbox if you bought
something for Smashbox oh okay my
challenge to you all so I was recently
at a mini marathon here in my hometown
and my boyfriend ran it now he did not
use to run in fact I had been running
for like five years and he just started
this year and then his dad and his dad
is a runner and so they signed up to do
this mini marathon which is actually a
half marathon so 13.1 miles and he did
it and really didn't train for it and
was able to finish he got a good a
decent time and it was just such a fun
atmosphere and I was like this is so
much fun I want to do it so this weekend
I signed up for next year's half
marathon and so did my boyfriend so
we're gonna run it together of course
he'll end up taking off and going away
faster but I've been kind of nervous
even though it's a year away I'm like
you know even if I train that's a lot of
miles I'm not used to running 13 miles
and I'm thinking can I do it and I've
just been thinking to myself and I'm
like you know what I want to do
something that completely scares the
crap out of me this scares the crap out
of me and there might be people watching
they're like oh my gosh you can do it or
oh my gosh I've run 13 miles but I can
do it you can do it which is great and
that's what I need to hear because I
really it's a year away but I'm still
nervous about and it's on my mind so I
just challenge you all to do something
that scares the crap out of you this
year whether it's I mean it could be as
simple as you know talking to someone
that you've been wanting to talk to or
running a marathon or a half marathon
whatever or just whatever it is that
scares the crap out of you maybe you're
unhappy in your job and you're like you
know what I think I can find a better
job than do it I challenge you this year
let me know what you're going to try or
you know maybe you're gonna take a yoga
class and even wanting to maybe you're
gonna take a dance class and even scared
too so that's kind of my challenge for
myself this year I would love to know
what your challenge is for yourself this
year are please let me know down below
because I think that's just so fun and
so we can just inspire each other
because I think that sometimes what you
need I remember my boyfriend's dad was
talking to us about it and he was saying
that some of the best parts of running
the half marathon is when people will
run past you and you can kind of see
that they're struggling or they see that
you're struggling and you'll they'll pat
you on the back as they run by you
but they'll pat you on the back and say
you can do it like keep going you know
and just people helping each other and
inspiring each other there's nothing
more powerful in the world than
something like that so I just love that
so I can't wait to hear about what you
guys are gonna do for yourselves this
year that scares you and me
even things you've already done this
year that are scared you I went to a
hip-hop class and it kind of made me
nervous because I was around people I
didn't know and and I'm dance I mean
it's not like I've never been in
augmented millions of dance classes but
there was something about this situation
that just made me really nervous but I
did it and I had more fun that I've had
and so long so go figure anyway I can't
wait to hear from you guys and I'll talk
to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
