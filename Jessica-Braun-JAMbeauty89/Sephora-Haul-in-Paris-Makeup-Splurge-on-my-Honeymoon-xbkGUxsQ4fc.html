in Paris on my honeymoon with Tyler
who's sitting over there so if you're
like clicking Keys it's cuz he's editing
a video I think right now but I went to
Sephora here in Paris on Rue de Rivoli
that's the American nice way to say it
but I can't say the French way because I
sound ridiculous
suet at Sephora and it's really big and
if you saw vlog number I think - so
right 3 1 of the vlogs on this channel
where I go in there it is humongous
among us you if you see that you already
know you won't you have a good idea of
what I got anyway but I wanted to share
with you guys because I know a lot of
you guys are interested I have never
been to a Sephora out of the country so
I didn't really know I'd heard that it's
more expensive for some things and a lot
of drugstore brands more expensive and
they sold l'oreal at the sephora but it
was like 20 dollars and ups or 20 euro
enough it was very expensive so it's
just kind of interesting you know there
are certain areas where i feel very
lucky in america that are cheaper but
then there are other things that are
cheaper here you know it's kind of the
grass is always greener so let's go
ahead and get into its I got a lot of
things so the first things we knew both
Tyler I knew we were gonna get there
were a perfume in a Cologne cuz we I
don't know we're weird and we like to
get a certain scent to remind us of
certain trips and you know like one that
we did in the past
he bought me misty or as a Christmas
gift when we were at Disney World in I
think last year last Christmas and so
now every time we both smell it we think
of that so it just got happy memories
tied to it so we wanted some honeymoon
Parisian scent memories so we both gave
one out I picked out la vie a bell which
is by Lancome which of course is a
Parisian brand which I like of course
it's widely available in the US as well
but this is one I gotten with my scent
bird that I mentioned black
than my favorites that I love it was a
sense that they matched me with and you
guys it is the most amazing sense really
simple packaging but it's just it's
sweet but sophisticated and it's got
these almost like spicy sweet but not
too spicy and not too sweet it's like
it's perfect I don't know how to
describe it and it's one of those scents
that the second I smelled I was like oh
my gosh and Tyler's the same he loves
the smell so I was very excited to get
that and then he picked out blue de
Chanel which of course again as a
Parisian brand and this this is the
hottest for him stuff
it smells unbelievable it's like oh it's
gonna who sees I keep doing that to
myself it's so masculine he's looking
this way
get off that tomorrow you're so handsome
this is just such a masculine scent and
he's sprayed it on earlier when we were
walking around in there it's like it was
kind of you know warmer out and there's
a parade going on and we were bustling
through crowds and and I could still
smell it on him after a few hours of
wearing it it was just wafting I'm like
oh my gosh it smells amazing
so if you're looking for something to
get I mean this is an expensive cologne
or actually technically it's an Eau de
Parfum but it is so oh my gosh it's the
best one I've ever smelled on whole life
whole life okay so next time now we're
getting into all the makeup Oh
first thing we'll talk about what's on
my lips the keep in mind is my
and this is you know a trip we've been
so excited for we've been saving up for
and we knew that with our wedding we
wanted to spend more money on the
honeymoon versus the wedding reception
because this is something that lasts
longer than a day and these are memories
of course the wedding was memorable too
but that's just the way we decided to do
it so I've been saving up to buy and
splurge while I'm here because I'm so
excited to be here one thing I picked up
was the Marc Jacobs Lamarck lip cream
and it's in the shade o Miley and that's
what I'm wearing today you guys this is
the most perfect read I've ever owned
these are so unbelievably creamy and
they just stay on I put this on earlier
and we had we drank water we had some
bread and cheese and it stays on like it
doesn't go anywhere and he's even kissed
me a couple times and there's not there
so a little bit of transfer but not as
much as most red lipsticks have I wish I
had not this shade but a something
in this line of lipstick for my wedding
because this is very long-lasting and
the one I wore was not oh I will do
video now so everybody calm down
uh-huh I love this it's expensive but
it's worth the splurge and I think like
next Christmas I might ask Forks I don't
know that I would splurge on another one
maybe and I want to get it more like
everyday color but I love this in the
red I've mentioned in my other videos
that I really liked was Mac well bottom
is their old matte line and they're so
dry and it was is the same shade of red
and I really like it but mmm I don't
know I don't know if I can wear it too
much longer it's too it's too dry also I
burned my arm a long time ago curling
iron I'm an idiot somebody has been my
Sephora wishlist for a thousand years
and I have I keep going back and forth I
never into buying it but now here I am
like two years later and I'm finally
buying it it's the benefit creaseless
cream shadow and it's in the shade RSVP
and I love the packaging of the actual
thing anyway it just looks like a little
cupcake or whatever you want to call it
but it's this beautiful iridescent
almost light pink with like a little bit
of gold a little bit of champagne it's
kind of got it all but I love this oh my
this is one of those colors that you can
wear just on your lip and nothing else
and you look so put together and it
doesn't budge throughout the day I
haven't really found like it reminds me
in a way of Mac vintage selection which
I actually brought with me because I
love that color but this is even
prettier it's more your a deficit more
obvious I don't it's a little more
opaque I guess so so far really
everything I bought is stuff that's
totally available in America and I'm
doing that I have a separate kind of
like drugstore brand haul of stuff from
here that I can't get in America but
with this stuff Sephora it's kind of
across the board that most of it is
stuff you can get anywhere so I just
kind of use this as an opportunity to
just learn for myself
so a lot of this is available wherever
you are this is not however this is the
sleek I divided palettes and eyeshadow
palette and this was 12 or 13 euros and
did I say it's the the name of the
palace oh so special I think I already
said that but these are such high
quality palettes for as cheap as they
are and I've always heard that I can't
get it open
but they really are comes with twelve
different shades and they're just
beautiful I've been using this one here
they actually have names this thing's
called organza it's not one there it's
like a shimmery pink it kind of reminds
me of the RSVP that'd be pretty layered
I'm wearing it on my lid today and I'm
wearing this darker Brown right there on
my lower lash line and kind of in my
outer corner I love this so much and I
thought was the only palette I found
there from sleek dated contouring like
little trio kit thing but it was way too
dark and I was like I'm not gonna spend
the money if I know I'm not gonna wear
it so but I was so excited to find this
there and I'm going to London in
December and so I'm excited to buy some
more sleek stuff because I know they
sell
all right so I got two nice products
again these are all like wishlist items
that I've been like wanting for so long
that I never pull the trigger this is
the NARS bronzing powder in Laguna
everybody that loves NARS loves this
product it's like their classic bronzer
that everyone in the world has that's
like obsessed with makeup the way that
we all are and it's just this really
pretty you know bronzer but it's got
this tint to it that looks so natural
and I remember for the longest time I
would say I'm not gonna get it because I
don't think it'll look natural on my
skin but it really does and it's got a
little bit of shimmer but not really
it's more satin than anything actually
maybe it doesn't have share it no it
does but it's more of a satin finish and
you just look so put together when you
wear it but you don't if it doesn't look
fake I'm sure if you put way too much on
of course it would but I love this stuff
so I'm really excited that I finally did
it the other NARS product that I got is
a blush and of course their names are
ridiculous this isn't the shade deep
throat and it's this gorgeous I would
call it pink but it does kind of lean a
little bit peach colored blush it has a
little bit of shimmer in it but not
really again this is more like a satin
blush and I love it it's so natural and
it's like finally a blush that is I feel
like this is meant for lighter skin
tones like mine I love it I'm so excited
to give us more love now all of these I
bought these like two days ago when I'm
filming this so I haven't really I think
I've tried everything out at least wants
some of it twice so keep in mind that
you know I've only tried it a couple
times so I really don't know exactly how
I feel about all of these
so one that I was really really really
excited about is the naked 2 palette I
have the naked one the naked I'm sorry
Naked basics - I have the original Naked
basics palette and I found that it's
just way too many light colors and like
nothing in between there's one color in
between that's like a medium kind of
like lid cup or not lid crease color but
beyond that there's like nothing and I'm
like what and so when the naked 2 basics
came out I'm just like that looks
perfect you guys I cannot stop wearing
this I'm wearing it today I told you I
was wearing a few sleep shows but the
rest of it is all this so I'm wearing
frisk and cover kind of mixed in my
crease and then I'm wearing skin fright
here to blend it all together and like
on my brow bone oh my gosh this is so
much better than the first one it's
crazy if you found that that's like
which you lie and then you're like oh I
don't want to get this cuz I don't want
the same thing this blows that one out
of the water it blows out of the water
like crazy like this should have been
their original it is so amazing and I
love that there's like cooler tones and
warmer tones it's so perfect and I love
using undone which is like this kind of
black but it's almost like brownish
black I love using that also on my lower
lash line in the outer corner like the
outer V so the nail polish I'm wearing I
also got a Sephora this is an OPI polish
in luckylucky lavender and I just think
it is so so so pretty it's just like
this light purplish pink lavender I mean
and I wish I had posted this on
Instagram and I think my facebook tree I
think I put it on all of them and I just
said it it makes me think of like French
lavender like in a country home in
France it just makes me think of that so
now I'll always tie this color and this
nail polish to this trip - that's a good
tip if you are traveling like if you're
just wanting to buy a couple things
you're not wanting to buy you know I
bought a lot of things because I planned
for it but you know if you know you
don't belong money you spend you just
want to buy a couple things to river
your trip instead of
you know we're probably still gonna get
like a souvenir magnet and things like
that that we usually get when we travel
but you know you can get a perfume or
you can get a nail polish or lipstick
something that just will always remind
you of that trip love it okay I also got
because I forgot to pack want a little
pencil sharpener this is just one from
Sephora because I didn't bring one and I
had like lip liner that I was wearing
and I'm an eyeliner that I brought and
I'm like I literally can't use these
here in the day or two when they're too
dull to use so I was excited to get one
of those and then I also got an eyelash
curler because I brought mine from Tarte
and it's getting really old anyway so I
was I knew I was gonna have to replace
it soon but the when I packed it the
actual little squishy thing in it hadn't
fallen out it's nowhere to be found so I
was like you literally can't use it like
if you try it's comical you it's not
usable so I found this at Sephora it was
kind of pricey for what it was but I've
heard good things about the Sephora
eyelash curler so I bought it comes in a
little box
it also comes like on the bottom of it
with an extra set or two yeah extra two
of the little things but it's nice the
last two things I got are nail things so
I needed for my nails these are of
course fake these are like acrylic nails
for my wedding but I had like a light
white tie like whoa the Sun just went
away
everything's dinner in it anyway um I
needed nail polish remover pads I'm so
mad at myself because I had these to
pack up and then in the shuffle of the
wedding and everything I didn't pack
them but it's just plain old I don't
even see mavala
I guess is the brand but these don't
have axes honed in it and they're kind
of more like oil-based and it's actually
really nice it feels very moisturizing
it takes a few more you know swipes on
your nail to get it off but they're
great for travel I think I have to
assume they're healthier for your nails
I don't really know and it works and
they actually smell really nice too the
last thing I got is this glass nail file
from Sephora and I have one of these
from OPI and it really is amazing
it really is amazing it doesn't hold
all other nail files don't hold a candle
to these glass files so and what's nice
about them is they never really you
never really wear them out you can just
run them under water and they're
literally as good as new
so I have that one OPI but it's the only
one I have that I've been wanting one to
keep in my purse as well so I bought an
extra one from Sephora for that case so
yeah so those are all the things that I
bought from support here in France I
can't promise we're still here for
another day or two at least when I'm
filming this can't promise that I won't
buy more but like I said I do have a
drugstore makeup haul which I might film
right now as well while I'm at it of
some things from like Pooja
the things that you really can't get in
the u.s. that I'm so excited to find
here I've asked you guys on my Instagram
that you guys were like you told me some
amazing things that I got some of the
things you mentioned so I'm really
excited to try them out anyway if you
enjoyed please subscribe and definitely
