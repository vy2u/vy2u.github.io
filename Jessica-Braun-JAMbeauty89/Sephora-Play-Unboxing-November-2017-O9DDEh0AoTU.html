unboxing the Sephora play box it's the
only subscription box I've been unboxing
on my channel I say I've been also it's
it's Friday after work
I've got dry erase marker on my hand
sharpie everywhere I've been grading
like a fiend and planning breath like
ready to pull my hair my head hurt so
I'd like turn my ring light down like I
can't look at it but I was kind of in
the mood to film so I figured I would
set everything up and chat with you guys
so this box is $15 a month you buy it of
course through sephora's website I like
it I pay for my own and it's not sent to
me or anything
I like it just because it's stuff that
you can buy at Sephora and since I'm
shopping there anyway I don't know like
I said this in the last video which I
can link if you want to see last month's
but my thing with it is like boxy charms
and hip sees and stuff it was fun cuz I
got to try random brands but when like
if I really liked a product and I wanted
to buy like a full size it was always
like I don't know like I feel like it
was hard to get like I'd have to order
it for a weird sign or I'd have to order
through it see and I'm like I really
have an account on epsy and you know
beyond just my subscription and at least
was the for I've got like points I can
accumulate anyway I'm over explaining
that is just one reason why I like it so
I'm intrigued to see what's in it let's
unbox it I should have got a box cutter
alright so it says they always have like
this little like color poster Hema but
it tells you what's in it
but it also has a card for 50 Beauty
Insider points but I think you have to
go in store um yeah anyway but that's
still pretty cool I never go in store
that's the problem so this is the bag it
says me o'clock and it's got a lady
meditating on it so cute little bag I
never really use these to be honest like
I don't travel with this kind of a bag
so I I think I still have mine from last
month and I'm like I don't really know
what to do with it so let me know if you
have any great ideas but I don't like
using bags just to use bags like if I
don't have a use for it I just don't
need to keep it anyway um so it always
comes with a fragrant sample and
I see some things I already love five
samples and one fragrance sample so this
doesn't count as one of the five items
this is my Burberry blush Oh de Parfum
let's see I'm always like nur I'm gonna
spray it on the car not on myself in
case I don't like this smell Tyler oh oh
that's strong
Tyler knows makes fun of me because I'll
be in a department store and I'm like oh
I don't like that he's like why'd you
spray it on yourself Mike I don't know
Bo I just did that's not my cup of tea
it's like very floral kind of fresh but
it's just not my cup of tea I don't know
whose I mean it doesn't smell terrible
but I don't want to smell like it that
makes sense I don't know I really like
the the bottle looks like it'd be really
pretty but I mean the smell is most
important anyway but I think people if
you like floral scents you might like
that
next thing in here is this little
Sephora lip gloss it kind of looks like
what I'm wearing on my lips today this
is their gel gloss ultra brilliant ultra
shine lip gel that's way too long the
title what shade it's in the shade
perfect nude let's just see about that
okay oh don't put applicator of course
it literally looks exactly like what I'm
wearing today just the perfect nude let
me compare it I'm actually wearing a
Charlotte Tilbury one let me compare
swatches okay so this is Charlotte
Tilbury in the shade seduction so oh
they're pretty close I think the
Charlotte Tilbury might be more pigment
less gloss if that makes any sense
well not really but they're really
really close I think seduction might be
a little bit Pinker but I mean they're
really close and I am sure the Sephora
one is much much cheaper so that's
pretty cool
I didn't open it all the way and now
it's like stuck so stuck up frankly this
is a full size Charlotte Tilbury they're
not that far off this how did this have
a smell a slight smell but it's like
kind of nice like it's like light
vanilla but it's not very strong alright
next thing in here is something this is
what I saw with my eyes nose like it's
this Moroccan oil looking a little baggy
so it didn't spill the Moroccan oil
Moroccan oil treatment those redundant I
actually had this exact bottle and I
traveled with it for like I swear a year
I mean often on travel but it's just
perfect to put in your hair like today
my hair is just completely air dried I
didn't blow dry it to make it like more
textured I just air dried it and all I
put in it is some kind of a hair oil and
this is an awesome one right now I'm
using like I think it's one from dis
Onge I can leave it below I really like
it I'm pretty sure it's super expensive
but I really like it
but I really love this stuff and I love
this size because I can travel with it
but what it does is it just kind of
helps eliminate some frizz like
obviously it's not perfect and I mean
that's not what I use today but it's a
similar effect it's not perfect but it's
a lot less than if I put nothing in my
hair and it just kind of moisturizes the
ends as well I don't put it up in the
roots because then it's like greasy day
one alright next thing in here is this
Kota Lee vino source I love their vino
source line it's there SOS thirst
quenching serum apply morning and
evening to face and neck before your
moisturizer so it's a true serum these
are all wine based that's what vino
source is that that whole line and I
really like their radiant serum like a
lot I tore through a full-size of that
so I mean I'm intrigued to try this one
especially since it's like SOS thirst
quenching we're getting into winter and
my skin is already it tends to be dry so
I'm excited for this to kind of help
that next thing whoa this Marc Jacobs
Velvet noir major Volume Mascara that's
pretty cool
I love getting mascaras in these because
to be quite frank the deluxe or just the
sample size lasts me as long as a full
size they dry out just as quick you
never go through the actual formula like
it never really runs out so in my
opinion this might as well be a full
size because after three or four months
I would have to throw this away same
with the full size so that I think is
really cool and I have never tried a
Marc Jacobs thing I really don't think I
have so do you I mean to open it and see
the wand I'm okay fine I'll open it I'm
just gonna have to use it now oh it's my
kind of a want it actually looks exactly
like what I'm wearing today the
lore'l lash paradise that's my favorite
that's the exact kind of one very light
almost fluffy and just tons of little
hairs sticking out that's not the right
word I can never think the word butt
looks like my kind of a wand we'll see
the last thing in here is this origins
clear improvement active charcoal mass
to clear pores I'm going to give this my
husband only I freaking love origins
like a lot and I'm really into their
original skin line like I am obsessed
with like all of those products right
now I'll talk more about those in some
other videos but my husband was just
complaining about his pores the other
night and so I think he might really
really like this but I might try it with
him to just cuz I like masks like this
but I have so many but think about this
all in all you're getting a hair oil a
serum a like mask for your pores a lip
gloss and mascara I think that's a
really nice mix of things last month
I really liked it because it was kind of
like a curated thing all for your face
so it was like every step you'd need to
have both clear skin but then also like
foundation as well and I thought that
was kind of cool but I like that this is
still a good mix we've got hair skincare
and some makeup it's not all skincare
not all makeup oh it says that this lip
gloss is actually supposed to be
plumping excited because this is my
favorite I'm going back to this but this
is my favorite kind of a gloss like what
I'm wearing today it's so easy to throw
on I don't have to wear lip liner I
don't have to worry about it getting all
over my face it makes my lips look
healthy it pulls my look together it's
just so fuss free but pretty and
feminine and I think that's why I've
gotten soap into gloss again and I'm
just so moving beyond you know
straight-up lipstick or matte lips
because I think gloss is so flirty and
feminine and comfortable to wear so that
is my game so hopefully you enjoyed this
I will put a link to all of these
products if you're interested in looking
at the full size and how much they cost
things like that I was hoping it said

course I'll put a link for the Sephora
play box down below as well other than
that I hope you enjoyed this video I
