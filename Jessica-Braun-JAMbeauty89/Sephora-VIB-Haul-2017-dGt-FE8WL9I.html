my Sephora vib sale
haul I ordered my stuff online the very
first day vib Rouge could purchase and I
just got it in the mail today so I'm
excited it's kind of perfect timing
because the rest of the sale just
started today November 10th I've tried
some of these already and some of them
I'm wearing others I haven't so I'll be
able to give you a little bit of a feel
but I will do a haul update here in like
a month or so like I've been doing here
on my channel so you can kind of get an
idea of now that I've used them how do I
like them because I do feel like I love
doing hauls but sometimes they're not as
helpful as they could be if we all did
update so like I said I bought all of
this online at 20% off and I always use
Ebates when I'm shopping online if you
don't know about Ebates they're actually
sponsoring this video I've worked with
them for years I love working with this
company because this is a website that I
use long before they had any idea of who
I was basically what you do is you go to
ebates.com
or you download their little tool bar
that pops up anytime you're on a site
that is eligible for rebates so for
example Sephora is and tons of other
Ulta is target like everything so what
happens is when I go to Sephora it'll
pop up because I download the little
tool bar and it will say hey this site
is four percent cashback or whatever it
might be that day and so I can click you
know shop and it will basically capture
everything I buy in that shopping trip
and whatever my total is four percent of
that will go into my Ebates account you
get paid four times a year
there's nothing skeevy about it it
really I mean it's a genuinely good
company I've been using it for years a
lot of people I know personally use it
other youtubers use it it's just a
really easy site to use it takes you
five extra seconds but you end up just
getting essentially free money back
which is awesome especially as we're
heading into you know the holiday season
and obviously there are tons of presents
people buy online as well it's just an
awesome tool so I will put my link below
they are also doing a giveaway with me
and so we are offering two Sephora gift
cards each will be worth $100 if you are
interested in the giveaway my link is
below to enter I am so excited because
so many of these products that I have
tried are really really good and they'd
be great ideas for you to spend that
gift card on
so Ebates link is below giveaway link is
below let's go ahead and get into the
hall this is a lot to show you I'm
really excited I'm trying to think of
like where to begin so I like to stock
up on things that I genuinely love so
why don't I start there because these
are things I've already tried I bought
two of the Beautyblender
I'm gonna be honest like literally I
bought these and then the next morning I
was using my regular Beauty Blender
these are like a nude colored one I've
never used I usually have like the pink
or the black but I thought that'd be
nice because when I get foundation on it
it's not super obvious and it doesn't
look gross I don't know but anyway I was
using my Beauty Blender and I realized
like man I don't this is not doing a
great job so I literally got my L'Oreal
pink one which I can also link below way
cheaper like half the price and I was
like yes because it works so well so I
was like oh no like I feel like now I
just bought two more and now I just want
more of the L'Oreal ones so I'm gonna
see the pink one I was using is an older
one so I do wonder if after you know a
year of using it if it just maybe
doesn't work as well so I'm excited to
have some fresh new ones to play with
but I kind of wish I would have only
bought one of them but anyway so that's
that so another thing I bought not for
the first time I repurchase is the
blender cleanser I like this I even use
it for brushes I mean it's safe to use
really on anything but I've never had
this big of a bottle it is kind of
pricey I would never buy it full price
even at 20% off I was like but I really
did miss having it cuz I think it is an
amazing cleanser especially for sponges
I've used bar soap like right now I'm
using dove soap for my sponges it works
pretty well it really does but I did
miss this so I'm excited to have this I
was gonna say in my collection it's not
really in my collection another
repurchase was the Stila stay all day
liquid eyeliner it's waterproof it's a
felt tip honestly this was like my Holy
Grail writer dye I only used it like
this was the only liner I used and
finally I was like come on Jess there's
got to be something better out there in
the drugstore for a way cheaper because
it is like 20 bucks so I discovered the
NYX epic ink liner and I loved it and
I've like I've got my Ulta cart right
now like three of them to buy again
because I can never find it in store
anywhere it's so
here um anyway but in the meantime I was
like I kind of want to try this again
and see how it compares now that I've
been using that next one for so long
like that's what I'm wearing today on my
eyes anyway so I do love this it is
waterproof it stays on all day it's
super black but now that I've discovered
the NYX one I'm like do I really need to
buy this anymore but I am excited to
have it I will link the NYX one below as
well if you want a more affordable
option that might be better the other
thing I repurchase is this hourglass 1.5
millimeter pack of eyeliners now these
are not liquid these are like a pencil
retractable liner but they are the
smallest thinnest liner I've ever found
which is amazing for the waterline so
it's literally a pack of three it's in
the shade obsidian which is like their
dark black they have like a dark blue
Brown I trade all of them and they're
all really good but the black I mean
it's just what I wear every day and it's
so pricey like you can buy one of these
I think it like $18 which i think is a
lot and of course this pack was way more
but of course with the 20% off like well
it is a better deal and I'm constantly
refining this so I was so excited to
finally buy the 3-pack I'm hoping this
last me a while because I feel like I
fly through these but they're so creamy
they're amazingly quick for the
waterline you can do the thinnest line
oh it is the best pencil liner ever okay
I don't think anything else is they
repurchase all of these are new to me
these are the things I'm like really
excited about let's start I only bought
one eyeshadow palette I was very proud
of myself and it's what I'm wearing on
my eyes today this is the hooda CUDA
Hutta I'm gonna be honest I don't know
how to say it I think it's huda beauty
but I've also heard people say hooda
beauty I'm like what is it like why
don't we know anyway it's the desert
dust palette this is something I was not
even on my radar and I don't know what
it was about it but as I was looking at
it and then I looked up swatches I was
like I feel like it's just different for
me like some of the warmer tones aren't
that different but like the purples
I am spitting everywhere the purples and
just like like this shade Cosmo is pure
glitter I don't even want to swatch it I
can't use it like I don't know how
people use it because obviously you can
use a glitter primer you can use setting
spray like all these different things
but I'm like that is way too much work
I'm not ever gonna do it so I kind of
swatch it and I was like
it's just like dry glitter everywhere
fine I'll do it okay so it's like just
glitter and it's just like pure I mean
it feels like cheap dry glitter no I'm
not saying this is cheap I'm just saying
this isn't it's only the one shade
that's like this and it's just not up my
alley I love the color though
I'm wearing angelic all over my lid I'm
wearing amber in the crease and on my
lower lashline I kind of blended it with
desert sand and musk a little bit that's
pretty much it but I just I really like
it I've only used it obviously today but
I'm just digging it I'm digging the look
on my eyes today it's not insanely
different for me but it is a little bit
more dramatic than I usually do and I'm
just I'm digging it all so are you guys
liking my shirt please let me it is full
on Nickelodeon hey Arnold and Rugrats my
two favorite shows like all time
this is totally a guy's shirt I don't
care
is this palette worth the price tag
it's certainly creamy and buttery like
the mats are nice the shimmers are nice
the only weird shade is just that
glitter but I know some people really
like that I don't know I feel like
they're better not I feel like there are
pallets out there that are just as good
this might be a step better but it is
still really pricey so like if you don't
own any expensive pallets or you have a
gift card you're like I just want to buy
one I don't think this would be the one
I'd recommend I'd still recommend like a
Naked palette or the chocolate bar
palette because I feel like those are
more versatile for everyday and they
still have some fun pops of colors
whereas this they do have some great
neutrals in here but I don't know I
guess it's just what is your cup of tea
that's what you've got to keep in mind
but I do like it and if I didn't mention
I'll link all of these below I'm gonna
be jumping all around I've got so many
different things I probably got like 15
more items to show you I wanted to show
you this perfume
it's from nest and it's the smell indigo
I have never in my life smelled a smell
like this I really have not it's just a
really cool kind of different bottle
like one side is kind of a matte like
almost sticker the other side is really
pretty it smells like
sweet laundry but like sexy like it's I
don't know how to describe it it's so
mysterious to me maybe that's the word
it's such a mysterious scent that it's
sweet as well if you've not smelled this
don't just order it go smell it and then
you'll probably want to order it like
this has been on my wishes for six
months and I'm like should I buy it I'm
like no Jessica you don't need it but
this was the time that I was like I'm
buying it I don't care I love it it's so
different than anything I've ever owned
and I just think it's it's just such a
mysterious wonderfully sweet and deep
scent I think you'll like it but it's
not heavy I think that's why I like it's
it's deep but it's not heavy like some
things you're like whoa that's way too
much but this is still like Airy somehow
it's the weirdest thing
all right next up something I'm just
tired of hearing about I needed to try
for myself is the Smashbox primer Iser
primer and moisturizer and it's got
hyaluronic acid and niacinamide
and I love well my skin I feel like just
loves those and this is so up my alley
like something that is a primer
moisturizer one like it reminds me my
origins one that I love so much what is
it called oh it's the original skin
matte moisturizer I feel like this is
like a very similar idea where they can
both be a primer but they're also
moisturizer I love this I'm hoping to
love this is what I like that this has a
pump also if you haven't picked up like
this is old set up like I rearranged my
room to have a genuine work station and
let me know below if you want me to do
like an official tour of this room like
in-depth not just like an overview and I
can do an official tour but I now have
like a workstation and I finally
freaking got my YouTube play button for
a hundred thousand subscribers I'm now
at like over four hundred thousand it's
taken this long it's a whole long story
and I had to like talk with YouTube and
figure it out but they gotta figure it
out and I finally got it because I was
like what happened like why didn't I get
it think everyone else got it so I'm so
like proud of it and so excited to have
it so it's like above my workstation
with my computer for editing etc so but
now I've got like my old school set up
back here and it just makes my heart so
happy like it genuinely does
ah anyway okay so very pumped about the
Smashbox primer I totally got off on a
tangent hold on I want to spray myself
even though I'm just in a t-shirt oh my
gosh all right what I used in my hair
today is this Brio geo curl charisma I'm
replacing my Rusk wired flexible styling
cream that I was just talking about in a
video I don't remember which one and
it's my favorite like cream to get my
hair to its natural state like you know
but look better not frizzy so I tried
this today for the very first time and I
feel like it did the same I think it's a
little bit flatter but I think it's
because I let my hair air dry more than
like usually I blow-dry it earlier but I
it was kind of drying just through the
air most of the way and that usually
makes it a little more limp but I liked
it so far I want to try it more I don't
think I can give my stamp of approval
yet but it smells nice brioche EO
products always have a light nice
fragrance which I kind of appreciate
nothing too heavy but it does smell nice
Oh something I used today to put on
these let's just lashes was this little
thing again I was tired of hearing
people tell me about it I wanted to try
it myself
it's the tarte little lash helper do i
think it totally transformed my lash
game No do I need more practice than
wearing fake lashes yes so that's
probably a bigger part of it but I felt
like I ended up you know applying it and
then still needing to hold it down you
know what I mean
so I don't think it's one of those
things that you just go up and it's like
miraculous but again I need more
practice not only just with this but
just generally and putting on lashes I
used to be so good at it back when I
warm and shows and I just I didn't don't
wear them as much and I'm trying to wear
more because I do feel like they make a
difference like in videos I don't wear
them to work but not that there's
anything wrong with that but anyway so I
mean it's fun I think it's pretty cool
again I don't think I would have bought
a full price I liked getting that 20%
off on it that's pretty cool if you
really struggle I think it would help
you I've tried it with tweezers no like
I have like ripped my lashes I've like
poked myself in the eye
but these aren't sharp or anything which
i think is pretty cool okay next thing
okay this is a weird thing these were in
the box of stuff I ordered and actually
was two different orders
I didn't order these and I'm looking up
the price no like day like these were
not Jie
they were just in the box and Sephora is
no idea who I am it's not like that like
it was through my regular support
account but I was like I'm not saying
anything so it was this brand
kapowie and this is their lip lub holy
crap I put this on this morning I swear
to you I have like the driest lips the
past mmm four days and I've done like
scrubs I'm like nothing's happening
what's going on with my lips so I'm like
chugging water thinking that's gonna
solve the problem it hasn't yet but so I
put this on I'm like I wonder if it's
any good I have never worn something
like this on my lips this is the crazy
it's like insanely oily if you will I
feel like I just wasted a bunch so it's
a creamy almost gloss like but it oh my
gosh it's like coconut but like better
like if you it's just an amazing smell
like I can't describe it it's not cheesy
coconut it smells good and it just like
I swear to you I feel like it healed it
like I got this this came in yesterday I
literally feel like it just healed it
overnight and I was like what is this
stuff so then I realize and I haven't
even opened this yet they had also sent
this 3-pack but I think it's like tit
yeah they're tinted so I'm like oh my
gosh so there's my time which is kind of
like a peachy there's hibiscus pinky
nice and obviously the more you spread
it out the more it's gonna shear out
like anything like this but it is more
tinted than I thought it would be which
is kind of fun cuz I feel like this is
just one of those things that they're so
comfortable for my lips so I assume and
hope they're good for my lips and so
it's kind of nice to have different
color options I can throw some in my
purse leave one at work things like that
so this is awesome I'm what a happy
mistake I don't know how it happened but
this whole kit is called their coconut
kiss kit so I'll link it below but don't
know how it happened so thankful and
happened so some of these were purchased
oh oh oh
do you want to know about a
disappointing one and this I've been
like genuinely sad I have been waiting
to buy a Tom Ford product for forever
like I for
so I finally bit the bullet and I bought
one of their eyeshadow palettes I was
pumped like when I opened this box and
this was the first thing I grabbed out
coz I was dying to swatch it and see it
in person I picked out and maybe this
was my first mistake I picked out the
palette market orchid haze packaging
beautiful there's like the little velour
thing in here that says Tom Ford awesome
so there's like the gold bar on the
bottom so you open it up these are the
shades so I'm like those are just
wearable shades well to be honest when I
looked at them online I'm like oh yeah
like perfect I would travel with things
I was thinking I want it I'm gonna buy
an expensive palette that's small I want
it to be great colors for travel that I
can wear all the time so I thought this
looks pretty good I'm so disappointed in
my old life how is this as expensive you
guys are gonna die when you see this
okay the dark shape pretty good the next
shade kind of weird and then the next
two are literally nothing nothing I
literally I'm like oh it's gonna be so
buttery so I'm like oh yeah so then I'm
trying it with brushes no difference
look what in the heck like who are they
trying to pull the wool over here I feel
like an idiot like I so this is being
returned and I'm so genuinely upset
because this is something like this I
don't know I'm just so like I know there
are big youtubers that love the Tom Ford
quads I don't get it and now I feel like
I was being lied to but but I would see
swatches and they were good so I know
that like they're really glittery
shimmery palettes which now I want to
like swap for but then I'm like do I
even want to spend the money on it you
know but I know like there's that one
that's like crazy glittery and shimmer
in its core just have seen swatches and
in all fairness I hadn't seen swatches
of this when I should have known but
you'd think at that freaking price tag
can you tell I'm like genuinely upset
like I really am so boo Tom Ford boo to
you really truly boo
get out of here fly so
the next thing I got was only because
Lola Lin here on YouTube who I met once
in person and she was so absolutely
lovely um and I felt so bad because like
I know her name's Laura and when I saw
her I said we it was like out of
Starbucks and I was like hey and she's
like hey Jessica how are you I don't
like go ahead and then we're like
talking and then I said Lola lit like I
couldn't remember her actual name and I
felt like such a heel because I was like
I know her name like I watch all of her
videos and it was just one of those
bright parts and I felt so bad cuz I
didn't want her to feel like I don't
know you guys know what I mean anyway
she was lovely but in one of her recent
video she was talking about this Sephora
like it's their volume effect lip gloss
I'll link it below but it's in the shade
outrageous it is gorgeous I put it on
not I mean it's not what I'm wearing
today obviously because it's just a nice
kind of peachy nude it does give that
plumping feel now she was talking about
how like people she knows would be like
oh my gosh like did you get fillers
whatever my lips are already decently
big so I hope he's like I don't want to
look too much bigger but I mean healthy
plump is nice so I like the tingly
feeling I didn't really notice yet if
there is a true plumping effect but I
love the shade outrageous it's such a
perfect everyday it looks beautiful on
its own and if you like that tingling
feeling you'd like this and she was
saying it's a total dupe for the Dior
like lip Maximizer but that's like
double the price of this which yay for
dupes and I think that was still like
twelve or fourteen dollars so it's still
not drugstore price although drugstore
prices are totally creeping up towards
that the next thing I got to try is the
Urban Decay Velvet Iser again everyone
was talking about I'm like now's the
time
it is cool packaging it's like the
little velvet kind of feel although that
just made me feel like nails on a
chalkboard so the idea is this is that
you can mix it with foundation I've seen
people put it under foundation and it
just seems to create this like really
satiny blurry kind of effect so I'm like
that's so cool so I just wanted to give
it a try to have fun it says UD on the
sifter it
I had oil on my hand from I think like
that lip gloss and it just like
completely like Hilda
that's so gross I mean obviously you're
not putting it on over and that's the
idea
so I'm so so curious again wait for that
hall update video here in about a month
on my channel cuz I will try these all
out numerous times and let you guys know
how I feel so I got two brushes this
okay this is the Sephora Pro airbrush
concealer I love brushes like this for
my concealer um I just noticed that
they're so quick and there's one I think
it's a deli um tools one that I love but
when it's dirty like when I've been
using it for like a week or two and I'm
like okay it's time to for real clean it
I don't I didn't have like a secondary
brush to kind of use in the meantime so
I was really excited to see this it's so
it's just like it it's just kind of a
kind of fake e synthetic feel but it's
perfect for concealer because it just
kind of blends it quickly you don't have
to get a sponge dirty you don't have to
use your fingers it's absolutely awesome
so I was so excited about that feels
supersoft and then I also bought just
because it looked different the
Anastasia a23 and it's there like I want
to say it was like they're targeted
highlight blush something like that
brush nut blush it's pinched in which I
didn't realize this when I bought it
it's pinched in but then it fans out you
guys see us so it's fanned out and then
it's pinched in so it's kind of perfect
for just applying it just to the areas
that you want it I thought that was neat
because I've tried fan brushes and I
feel like that just gets everywhere and
then bigger brushes it really gets
everywhere so this is kind of right in
between and I really thought that was
cool so I'll have to let you know I also
bought because um Ingrid from well it
was like missglamorazzi I don't know if
she still goes with that but Ingrid
Nilsen here on YouTube has loved this
for years and I just never tried it it's
the NARS smudge proof eyeshadow base at
least I think this is the one she always
use it was bigger than I thought I used
it today for the shadow I do feel like
it stayed on all day it's just kind of a
white but it becomes mostly translucent
when you blend it in classic eyeshadow
base
I really don't own ones like this
anymore I always have like the thick
creams that you kind of squeeze out so
I'm excited to try one of these that's
supposedly really good and see how I
like it because I don't feel like I've
found any in this format that I do like
so
again it's super pricey so I'll have to
let you know how it performs so I also
picked up the Urban Decay afterglow
highlight a lot of people are talking
about this recently however mine came
freaking broken no it's not terrible but
it's kind of those things that I'm like
since I'm already returning the Dior I
might return this and buy a new one
it's like coming out of the pan here and
it was cracked there now I did try it
I'm wearing it today
I just kind of applied it lightly but
here why don't I apply a little bit more
I'll use my new Nastasia brush but it's
in the shade sin I can't see what I'm
doing so I'm really hoping yeah that
looks amazing
I mean again it's like see it from space
kind of a highlight oh my gosh I would
just just put it on my upper lip I
didn't even like get it in the Cupid's
bow just right on the lip um so it's a
really pretty shade it really is and I
think I still do want to own it but I
think I'm gonna return this one
hopefully get a better one since I'm
already returning the Dior thing I think
if I weren't I'd probably just keep it
repress it make it work but since I'm
already doing it I might as well keep
the train rolling and get a fresh one
because it was still expensive you know
I think we deserve a brand new one not a
broken one not that it's Sephora's fault
but anyway okay next okay those are
samples I'll show the samples at the end
this is something that swept me off my
feet this is the Kiehl's midnight
recovery i I had had a sample for ever
and I just did like a travel sized
declutter video which again I can link
below and this was one of the things
that I was like a hit it was almost gone
I love traveling with it in the winter
because it's such a luxurious eye cream
and I just feel like it works I feel
like it moisturizes really well and it
just feels good on your under eye and I
just put it all the way around 360 um
anyway but it was a tiny one and I
finally used it up I put it my bathroom
and used it up because it was almost
gone I finally about the full size I
just love it it feels amazing on my
under eye and I feel like I noticed the
difference when I'm using this versus
other eye creams and it's really one of
the first eye creams I felt that
strongly about like I feel like other
ones I try and I use
I'm like it was pretty good I think you
know but this is one that I feel like I
do notice some a noticeable difference
now are my fine lines magically gone no
I don't think that's ever gonna happen
and that's fine but I just feel like
they're moisturize like I tend to get
dry skin sometimes in the winter
especially on my like lid and this I had
recently and a lot of you guys were
commenting different things but I ended
up using the rest that sample and it
like healed it up so love this stuff
okay the next thing I'm trying out is
from way it's their memory mist I
haven't heard anyone talk about it in my
head it's gonna be like a texture spray
oh it's a heat protectant oops oops says
for use before you style this
multitasking priming spray adds heat
protection shine and long-lasting memory
to any look curls and blah see that's
still gonna be good though using a
one-of-a-kind formula the lightweight
spray memorizes your hair shape and
texture until your next shampoo think
you could still use it as a texturizing
spray I'll have to let you know I'll use
that the heat protectant but I don't
often I don't do my hair where like a
heat style it all the time other than
blow-drying which is heat styling but I
feel like it's not quite as bad as like
irons and things like that straighteners
um it's not quite as direct I guess I'm
saying so I will let you know I'm kind
of sad though I they have a texture I
need spray I knew I should have just
gotten that but I might still try it
anyway and let you guys know I also
bought from Kiehl's cuz I was just on a
kick there creme de coeur it's expensive
I'm gonna be very clear with you but I
suffer from the itch iasts legs and I've
tried like and I don't I know a lot of
years like you have X amount I'm like I
don't think I do I haven't gone to a
dermatologist to ask because it's not to
that point where I feel like it's that
bad but I've used some anti itch lotions
they usually work and I've but I feel
like it's really just it only happens
the winter I think it's just dry skin
and then I just subconsciously
itch it so I want it a lot of people
have said they just love this it's so
moisturizing and so I feel it figured
it's worth a try and I think if this
doesn't work then I might but again like
it's not so bad that I've got like scabs
and stuff like that it's just kind of
uncomfortable I guess I'm going to bed
the sheets of it my legs and tickle um
and I just want to itch um that kind of
a thing so anyway total tangent but it's
insanely expensive so I'm very
intrigued to try this out and let you
guys know if it lives up to the height
because a lot of people swear by this
stuff which means they're buying it all
the time and I'm like that's a lot of
money for a Body Lotion essentially so I
will let you know if it's worth it I
almost hope it's not but then again of
course I hope it is because I spent the
money but if it is that means I'm gonna
want it again next thing is this set now
this I don't think I bought I think it
was with points
I bought it there are four products in
here from Peter Thomas Roth I bought it
just for one product because it was
already in my love's like wish list and
then I saw it was a part of this a month
perfect cuz I haven't tried it and so I
thought well this is kind of the perfect
way to try it so it's a little set of
four thing so it's got the anti-aging
cleansing gel and we're traveling like
two different times this like over the
holidays so I'm totally gonna use these
this is their hyaluronic cloud cream
this is not why I bought it but I'm very
excited to try that because like I
mentioned the hyaluronic acid my skin
just loves it drinks it up oh this is
thing so then it also comes with their
Irish more mud purifying black mask
which I'm excited to try I'm just
curious this is what I wanted this is
their firm ex peeling gel and it says it
visibly you visibly roll and lift and I
can't read this visibly roll lift roll
they don't have commas
you'll visibly roll lift and sweep away
dead skin cells cells when massage on to
skin multi action enzymes and cellulose
help uncover smooth fresh new complexion
I just want to see this in action I'm so
curious about this and I think it's
perfect to try it because if I hate it I
don't want a bill thing that I'm not
gonna use considering this expensive so
this was I want to say probably a
500-point perk I'm embarrassed that I
have as many points as I do I really am
I mean I get it it's my job but I'm
still like it's awesome but then there's
a lot of times that I'm like like none
of those look good but right now they
have a lot of really good ones the other
samples I picked up the other ones I got
were like little perfume ones and little
packets of things I didn't think those
are really worth showing but these two
were like legit 100-point perks this is
the nest so that same brand is the
Indigo one but it's in black tulip let's
smell this I thought that's actually a
insane deal considering this fragrance
is expensive
it's a rollerball see they come up with
the craziest fragrances this one's a
little bit more musky than the other but
again it still smells fresh and sweet so
it's like the perfect like winter I'm
excited to have us in Charles that's
perfect and then also this isn't
expensive the Sunday Riley CEO
moisturizer it's C and E so vitamin c e
and then anti oxidant that's the O
moisturizer
I just heard amazing things about Sunday
Riley in general I was just recently
talking about I really want to try there
what's the one you guys know it not the
Luna I mean I want to try all of their
products but it's the like lactic acid
treatment I'll put it on this you guys
are probably screaming at the screen
right now um anyway and so I'm thinking
about they're like you guys told me
about kits they have with that in it and
so I'm like perfect but this was a
100-point perk I'm just curious
smells like or oh this wasn't orange
sherbert holy moly it smells so good so
I'm totally totally in for trying this
considering how ridiculously expensive
Sunday Riley products are so those were
