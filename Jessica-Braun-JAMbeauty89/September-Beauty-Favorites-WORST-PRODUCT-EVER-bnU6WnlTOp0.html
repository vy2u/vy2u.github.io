have my September favorites guys it is
October best month of the year because
it's like real fall like it's like
legitimately autumn and guys look I have
some autumn decorations back there by
the way the Dollar Tree is an awesome
place to find decorations like I've
always known that but this year it's
like out in full swing like droves of
autumn related items they even if like
like leaf shaped candle holders and just
like little owls statues and just
everything you could want the Dollar
Tree hasn't it's all a dollar so anyway
that is besides the point so I'm excited
to share with you some things that I
loved and do I have anything I didn't
know I think everything I have are
things that I love there are no big
misses that's not true there's one big
miss that I'll share with you anyway so
the first thing I want to share with you
is fall related and it's not beauty
related but I don't care so this is the
Bath and Body Works sweater weather
candle and this one it's almost as if
there's a bite to it like when the wind
is getting chillier and you feel it and
all of a sudden there's like a certain
crispness to it that's like what this
smell captures I don't know how to else
to explain it
it's almost spicy it's not what pumpkin
E or anything like that which I like
pumpkin smells but sometimes they make
me feel nauseous I don't know why and
this one is very different but I love it
if you haven't tried this or smelled it
give it a smell give it a sniff okay so
let's see one thing that I rediscovered
lately is my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray this is the old packaging
I've had this forever and I used to use
it every single day and then it became
more off and on and I hadn't used it in
a while and I just recently started
using it because I've been student
teaching and boy howdy these days are
long long long and this stuff my makeup
stays not like I put this makeup on that
I'm wearing other than the
I put this makeup on at like 5:30 this
morning and here it is about 5:00 p.m.
when I'm filming this and I would say
it's pretty good I did use like an oil
blotting sheet on my face and like I
said I reapplied lipstick but this stuff
is amazing I'm telling you there is a
difference between when I don't use it
and when I do especially if I'm working
during the day you know so I love it if
you haven't tried it and you've tried
maybe cheaper setting sprays and you're
like oh I don't think they make a
difference then maybe it was because
they just weren't that good because this
one really does make a difference I
highly recommend it
all right um another thing I've been
loving and I I had no idea whatever like
this it's the elf tone correcting powder
it's the one that looks like a dish and
this one's in the shade cool they also
have warm which is like a little
different variation of these four colors
but I've always seen this and never
thought to get it and I finally did and
it's fair I'll swatch it for you it's
certainly like almost pigmented if you
want to call it that and it's just I use
it as just a setting powder but it
really does have a corrective quality it
does tend to load you can't see of
course it blends out but it does tend to
look a little bit powdery when you first
apply it and I only apply it to my
t-zone but if you you say a setting
spray and Urban Decay has the one called
do me de W me and it makes your face it
kind of adds some moisture back into
your face an elf even sells the makeup
mist and set if you use that with this
it'll help you know kind of get rid of
the powder enos but really leave the
tone correcting quality that it really
does have so I love this stuff it's
three dollars okay another thing I've
been loving another rediscovery is my
bare essentials handy Buki this is a
brush and I bought it a long time ago
because my sister had it and I just fell
in love with it and what I've been using
it for is bronzer and just for
contouring and I love it because it
really can get in there without looking
too much like a line like some brushes
might tend to and I think this is a
great brush if you're more inexperienced
with contouring
this is a great type of brush whether
it's this one or not this type of size
and shape because you can really kind of
get in there without getting everywhere
and without making it look like a line
so I really really love this and I
hadn't use it in a while and boy howdy
the past two weeks I can't stop using it
I just fell back in love with it okay um
so a few nail polishes that you guys
threw the best fall nail polishes ever
okay one is Essie
it's called wrapped in rubies you guys
look at that color oh isn't that
beautiful okay my nails are not painted
in fact right before this video I was
like I need to like do something about
my nails so I just removed the nail
polish cuz I had been like picking at it
you know you know how once it starts
feeling you're like well I guess I
better peel it the rest the way off and
then you have like two nails with
nothing and then the rest are okay so I
took it all off why am i explaining this
anyway
this color is absolutely stunning on
your nails and I'm fair-skinned and a
lot of deeper colors look kind of funky
on me but this one looks great and it's
like all the colors of fall wrapped into
one
oh and then another one it's the Sally
Hansen complete salon manicure one of my
favorite nail polish lines and this is
called guilty party I don't know if
you're me let's see the spelling it's GI
lty but look at this color and it comes
across that way it's almost not chrome
that's not the right word but it's
certainly metallic and really pretty and
I really think these would be pretty
paired together with like this as an
accent nail or even vice versa but I
love both of these for fall so much okay
toasty so here's the product that I
hated and I'm so sad that I hated it it
is the tom's of Maine deodorant
basically here's what it looks like I
always see it in the store and I thought
I should try natural deodorant see if it
works on me it's healthier for you blah
blah blah blah blah and it is however
you guys I know this did not work for me
at all like literally within like a
couple hours of putting this on Mike's
is that me like oh my gosh I was so
embarrassed
so I mean pretty quickly I real
this did not work I still I would say I
gave this three weeks of a shot I would
say that's plenty of time to determine
if I like this I wanted to give up day
two I was like nope this is terrible but
I gave it a try and it is terrible for
me now every cue if you want to have a
totally different body chemistry with it
and it might work great and I'm jealous
if it does doesn't work for me I'm gonna
be trying out some other natural
deodorants so so in the meantime I'm
using just like a bad for you deodorant
because well that's what I still have
and well it works on me so anyway okay
oh there's so many favorites you guys
I'm so excited to share these with you
so this one is the down boy blush from
the balm this is like the one blush for
the balm that I feel like never gets
talked about very often of course all of
the blushes from the balm are very very
pigmented this is just such a pretty
light pink it makes me think a pink
swoon from Mac but I think I think pink
swoon might be a little more cool toned
but it's beautiful it's matte and it's
my favorite when these go on sale on
HauteLook these are usually about ten
dollars so it's it seems pricey for a
blush drugstore end but it really is
kind of I would say it's a high-end
blush and I think the original price is
like twenty dollars so it's a pretty
good deal and I love it and you're never
gonna run out of it well you might but
anyway okay another this is like a kit
that my friend Alexandria sent me and I
love it it's the Cabana glamour kit and
I know that there's a good deal on this
I want to say at the Ulta it might be
support I'm not sure but it's so awesome
because it comes with a lot of stuff it
comes with the some kind of gorgeous
comes with the hoola bronzer which that
in itself is like $28 this three
eyeshadows and then it comes with a
little tiny brush for your living and
then posy tint now what I'm gonna talk
about with this kit are these two things
the hoola bronzer it is my favorite I
have a separate one I just love it it's
and then but really the hit of the land
is the hit of the land guys I've been
working the kids see long I'm saying
like crazy things that make no sense
anyway okay so these three eyeshadows
are gorgeous and look at this
pigmentation I lost my mind
well okay I will admit that the middle
one is not no it is is picking say it
just blends in with my skin tone look
those they're so beautiful and these
three colors together I usually let me
wipe this off on my well my arm the
light would of course on my lid this one
in my crease in this one on the outer
corner that's the classic you know the
way you use shades but it's beautiful it
really is these shadows stay on all day
of course I always prime with it so I'm
not sure how they would do without but I
love it and this is such a good deal I
gotta find the price but it's such a
good deal I haven't really gotten to
play with Posey tonight very much and
some kind of gorgeous I think might be
too dark for me it's medium now I'm
going to Florida soon so maybe I'll be
dark enough to use it then I don't know
but I love this kit love it
okay so what I'm wearing on my lips is a
favorite of mine and this is like this
week I was like this is a favorite I
love it it's this color right now okay
um it's called blushing mauve and I
isn't it pretty
it's just such a pretty color I know I
have it on my lips but I'll swatch it on
my hand anyway it's such a like I don't
know it's a different color than what I
typically wear I really like this
lipstick it is absolutely stunning I
think it works okay with my skin tone
it's a little deeper than what I usually
wear but I do like it a lot and I just
love the Revlon lipsticks in general
they seem to be a little bit more
moisturizing like right now it feels
like I have a lip balm on which is
pretty cool anyway okay so another
another rediscovered this is the NYX
single eye shadow and it's in the shade
flamingo and it's just so pretty now
this to most people might look like a
lid color which absolutely it could be a
nice pretty lid color but I use it a lot
for like just when I just want a simple
look which is pretty much my everyday
I'll put this just in my crease and it's
a really light way to add a little bit
of dimension to your eyes without really
looking like you're doing much at all it
is shimmery though but not it's really
nice it's just a really nice shadow I
love it
I
if I ran out of this I would repurchase
this shadow which is so rare but if
there's something about the color that I
just I love this color I've had it for
three years okay okay there's two more
things I'll share one and then I'm gonna
share my most most most favorite of the
month ever ever ever okay so this is the
covergirl flamed out shadow pencil and
it's I don't know the shade I'm sorry it
was on the wrapper it says 3:40 here so
maybe that's like the number but you
guys oh my gosh is that showing right
there you see that shimmery strip that's
this this stuff doesn't move it doesn't
move you put it on within probably 10
seconds it's set and it does not go
anywhere it is amazing I used a lot just
under my before I put my mascara on as
just like my lower lash I don't line
with something dark this is really fun
and it's like a really nice shimmery
thing and then your mascara over it it
just looks really nice together and like
I said it doesn't go anywhere it's
probably not obvious on camera but it's
still in person it's still there the way
I put it on it's pretty amazing I don't
think this is the setting spray but I'm
pretty sure it's this innocence
okay one last thing and I dropped it you
guys this might be my new Holy Grail
mascara that's all I'll say
it's the Palladio curls rule herbal
curling mascara it's green that looks
like this
there's hmmm I love this stuff the brush
is really nothing special it's just you
know it's not humongous which I know
some people like it some people hate the
big brushes I'm trying to notice if
there's anything interesting about the
shape but I really don't think there is
but it's kind of almost like messy if
you look at it but there is something in
this stuff and it's not waterproof and
this is just in black there's something
in this the curl from your lashes stays
all day I've never used a mascara where
it genuinely stayed all day like I kept
looking in the mirror and thinking oh
everything's gonna look kind of messy
nope no weird fall out no smudges no
like it literally looks like I just
curled my lap
all day I cannot stress to you that this
semester is amazing the only thing I'll
say is if you're inexperienced with
mascara this is not a starter one
because it it doesn't clump easily but
it would easily if you're layering a lot
it would very easily start to look it
might start to clump or it might I mean
it's a lot this is a very I guess wet
mascara so you have to be careful with
it however a great thing I've done if it
did get clumpy on me oh I'm getting
ready I just used my covergirl clump
crusher and brush through it and it's
like BAM and it holds the curl all day I
just can't I have not found a mouse gear
like this that works for my lashes this
way I love it I love it so much I could
talk about this all day I mean I need I
just need to simmer down this past month
