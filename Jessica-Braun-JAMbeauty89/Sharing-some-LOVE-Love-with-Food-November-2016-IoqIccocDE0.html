the holiday season is among us and I am
so excited to share with you one of my
favorite subscription boxes this video
sponsored by them this is love with food
and I'm excited I worked with them a
couple times now this is the company I
have a history with so it's always
exciting to share some of their new
boxes and this is their deluxe box that
I'm gonna unbox with it being the
holidays before I even start tasting all
this stuff talking for real about you
know the season of gift-giving this is
one of those things that it's a company
that for every box that you buy they
donate a meal to a family or someone in
need and I think this is one of those
times that we are so lucky and if you've
got a phone or device where you can
watch this video or you you know aren't
starving
you know a bunch of days in a row we're
so lucky and there's so many people
countless people that are not that lucky
there are people that live you know
within 20 minutes of me are that are not
lucky and you know keeping that in mind
I think it's really cool that you know
if you were to buy this for yourself or
you were to buy this as a gift for your
mom or your coworker whatever um you
know they're donating meals and it's
something that I think is important in
this season to keep in mind and I know
that so far love with food is donated
like over a million meals so far I mean
it's incredible and it's all just people
like you and me you know supporting them
and buying boxes like this so I'll get
off my high horse but I just think
that's really cool and that's why I like
working with them so keeping that in
mind this is the deluxe box and they
gave me a 25% off code if you are
interested in buying this for yourself
or as a gift 25% off of your deluxe box
link will be down below they also have a
tasting box which is a smaller version
of the deluxe box and then they also
have the gluten-free box and all of the
things in there are like celiac you know
approved and that's awesome because my
mom is gluten free and so I'm thinking
about gifting her the gluten free box
just because it's the perfect time and
actually her birthday's on Christmas so
it's always perfect but if you know
someone like that that would be the most
thoughtful awesome gift for them because
you know it can be hard there's a lot of
gluten-free option
out in the world but it doesn't mean
it's super easy to be eating gluten-free
so I think that's awesome so this box oh
my gosh I can't wait to try all this
look at all these goodies so so many
goodies I am so excited to give these a
try so let's just dig right in this pump
it comes the - of the Cinnabon popcorn
oh my gosh it's cinnamon roll flavored
stop it oh my gosh I thought it would
have like a slight taste of it no it's
like full on it tastes like a cinnamon
roll
mmm my best friend Sarah I might save
this for for the next measure she loves
like Cinnabon and things like that she
will love this the next thing there are
two of these PB thins peanut butter
crackers only a hundred tab calories oh
my gosh they're so cute mm-hmm they've
got like this gosh it reminds me of
peanut butter Captain Crunch which by
the way is my favorite cereal so that's
a cup that's a huge compliment mmm just
the right amount of peanut butter you
guys know what I mean hmm and they're
not too sweet either they're right
between I love it I'm gonna bring a lot
of these to work the things
next thing oh I love these and actually
my mom loves these - these are the snack
factory pretzel crisps and my mom loves
these I've had them at her house and you
know pita chips
I love pita chips like dipped in hummus
but pita chips can be kind of expensive
but these are really really good and
crunchy and they're amazing dipped in
hummus as well or anything for that
matter but they're really really thin
crisps these are so good mmm and because
they're thin you can you know totally
layer toppings on top of them so I love
these I drink some water here all right
next thing there are two of these new
nutrit Eva banana bar sits banana and
chocolate okay you know how to say can
shake they have
side-by-side milkshakes well my favorite
side-by-side milkshake is banana and
chocolate called binocular so I am so
excited since what is better than one
banana three bananas and one so one
nutritive of banana bar brings natural
goodness for your benefit and enjoyment
oh my gosh mmm they have like the chewy
texture similar to bananas but it's not
you know I thought it I almost thought
it might be just a chocolate-covered
banana but it's way better and I love
the Nancy's but it kind of fills that
chocolate need that you have throughout
the day like that I have like all day
long so so good so much in here so this
next thing is a biscotti yay it's a soft
baked biscotti and chocolate chip
brownie and it's from the brand Marlo's
Bake Shop it makes me want to get some
like afternoon coffee to go with this
maybe I will when I'm done filming here
mmm it is soft baked like you know it's
still crunchy it's got that biscotti
crunch but it's not so ridiculously hard
like a normal biscotti is I really like
that
but it's still definitely crunchy and
it's got that chocolatey taste mmm
that'd be great with like a cafe au lait
just some coffee and milk with that mmm
all right so the next thing in here is
this Zook I think Jubilee mix spicy
wholesome trail mix and it looks ooh it
does it looks like there's like some
peas and stuff in there I love mixes
like this so yeah it's all like a bunch
of little things mm-hmm it's definitely
got spice to it
ooh mmm
and it's definitely crunchy again like I
feel like when I get home from work each
day
I am dying for something crunchy and
salty I don't know what's wrong with me
my mom is the same way I must have like
learned it from her I don't know but
this would be one of those most perfect
things that when I get home I'm not
gonna sit down and like eat a bunch of I
don't know tortilla chips and stuff like
this would be a little bit better
really satisfying then it does have that
spice my husband's gonna love this as
well awesome wow this really big thing
in here this is the thin stirs cookie
thins and pumpkin spice awesome it's
awesome that it's got such a big one in
here so yeah there oh my gosh they smell
so good
want to bottle this up into a candle so
they are thin they smell so good I wish
you guys could smell them man these are
so good I'm so glad it's a big one these
have like this buttery taste to them
which I love but they're also coarse
sweet they it reminds me of like a
gingersnap
but with pumpkin flavor to it I love it
oh my gosh those are so good
alright so it also came with these tasty
brand organic fruit snacks it has no
high fructose corn syrup real fruit
juice let's go I love fruit snacks
mmm all different little shapes and
textures so so good hmm then I do want
to mention that like if you get
something in your box that you love you
can like if you want to buy the full
size or buy more of it you can go on
their website and then buy it so like
I'm sure you could go on and buy like a
box of these if you really like em or
you've got kids that really like them
but either way really good they also
have this Sun right fruit to go little
roots trip oh you see fruit strips all
the time like I swear like when I was in
high school it's a very interesting kick
but they are really good let's go yeah
it's like a just gonna bite it out of
here mm-hmm Apple raspberries the flavor
so good they also have this what it's
from shine organics and it's their
revive it's a blend of organic fruits
veggies in Micronesian
pear celery coconut lime green tea and
Chia this would be great for you know
like I try and make a bunch of smoothies
like at the beginning of the week for
both of us and then we just have them
throughout the week but if there's a day
I mean these would be kind of a perfect
swap for that because it has all those
kinds of nutrients cuz we put like Chia
and ours as well let's try it do you
remember oh I'm gonna tell you what it
tastes like actually it's really good
do you remember when they and they might
still sell it this way so let me know
below but when they you know you can get
like the apple sauce in the little cups
well I remember there was like a flavor
and it was like pink flavor you know
what I mean like something like that
this reminds me of the pink apple sauce
you used to be able to get this is
really really good it actually kind of
reminds me of the taste of the smoothies
we make sometimes too awesome and again
it's something if you had a bunch of
these in your fridge or somewhere you
can just toss it in your bag or in your
lunchbox whatever and go that's awesome
so the last thing in here are these
little looks like they're little caramel
Zoar chews it's from go organic and it's
just been choose and the flavor is
chocolate ginger wow that was such an
interesting combo of flavors I had stuck
to the roof of my mouth and I could not
get it off I was freaking out my tongue
was like come on anyway
what ginger is so good and like my
favorite way I've had it is like in
ginger ice cream oh my gosh but with the
chocolate it was such a really cool
combo another thing I love is that they
always have like some coupons and stuff
so like they have $1 off of the pretzel
crisps oh and you can find them at the
store they also have $1 off of the shine
organics little squeezy thing that I was
just trying it also gives you a $40 off
