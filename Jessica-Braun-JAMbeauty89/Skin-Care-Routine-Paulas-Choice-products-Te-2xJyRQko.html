I am very excited I am going to be
reviewing polished choice this entire
line of skincare that they sent me and
you guys have known if you follow my
channel for any length of time Paula's
Choice is like what changed my skin and
I've never had absolutely terrible skin
but I struggled with a lot of
hyperpigmentation here and I've
struggled with just lots of hormonal
breakouts and just dry flaky skin but
then it would be oily the next day and
it just never seemed balanced I guess is
what I'm trying to say and when I would
get a breakout it would be so painful
that it would just it would take forever
to go away and they'd be painful for
like two weeks they'd be deep under the
skin and polished choice skincare I
finally started looking deeper into
skincare and I was like gosh these
things are so expensive are they worth
it and when I would look online for
reviews I found out about this site
called Paula's Choice and they had this
beauty pedia like an encyclopedia for
skincare and makeup and you could look
up virtually any product whether
skincare or makeup and they would rate
it these dermatologists that work for
Paula's Choice would rate it best good
better bad terrible you know whatever
the scale was and they would tell you
why this wasn't good or why this was
good what the ingredients were in it
what was bad about the ingredients what
about the packaging I learned so much
just looking products up and I ended up
going through my makeup collection and
skincare collection and getting rid of a
ton of products that were really
expensive that were horrible for my skin
I mean I had some skincare products that
were like hundred dollars that I thought
oh this will help with you know the
little fine lines that are starting or
oh this will help with breakouts that
were actually doing nothing absolutely
nothing or they had ingredients in them
that were actually really bad for my
skin so that's where I began with
Paula's Choice then I started buying a
few other products I actually bought
their resist cleanser and what else I
bought the resist moisture Iser and fell
in love
with them and they in the realm of
skincare they weren't as cheapest
drugstore but they weren't as expensive
as like $100 which is why I ended up
buying these and this is when I remember
I bought these when I didn't really have
a job job I had my youtube channel which
really I wasn't making a ton of money
off of still am NOT but um and I didn't
like now I've got a teaching job
I bought these before I had a teaching
job because I knew even though these
were a little pricier than drugstore
that it would it would help my skin and
it did and I'm so thankful that I made
that small investment then because now
my skin I'm now I'm not scared to go out
without foundation on like I'm proud of
the way my skin looks that I'm not
scared to show my skin in front of the
camera when I'm doing like foundation
demos and things like that I don't mind
the way my skin looks and this is like
the first time in my life that I felt
that way and I really feel like it's all
thanks to all of this so I'm going to
show you all the products that are in
like this one particular kit they sent
me I went through like the whole process
where they on the phone they ask you
questions like okay tell me about your
skin what are you concerned about what
are you noticing how old are you things
like that
and they sent me this kit and then they
also sent me a few extra things for
particular skin concerns so I'm going to
go through the order that I apply them
in so you can know and maybe see if you
don't want to buy like a whole kit
because it is pricey when you're buying
an entire kit maybe you see a product or
two that you're like you know what that
would be good for my skin you can try it
out of course I will link all of these
products separately below as well as the
entire kit if you are interested in it I
am so thankful that Paula's Choice was
collaborating with me on this because
this is a company that i 100% believe in
everything they stand for i've got the
goose was talking about it it really has
changed my life i'm not going to tear up
because i almost about to but our skin
is so important and for for someone to
find a brand a company and a bunch of
products that work so amazingly is I
mean it's so important this is more
important than any makeup review I could
ever do because makeup just covers it
and this is the stuff that's actually
making that
basse that I'm putting all my makeup on
to the way that I wanted to be so let's
go ahead and get so the kit that I have
is called the resist advanced kit for
wrinkles and sun damage and that's what
she had kind of paired me with based on
what I told her about my skin that it's
kind of combos sometimes it's dry here
sometimes it's a little bit oily that I
sometimes have hyperpigmentation and
that you know early signs of aging like
fine lines and wrinkles there things
like that so this is what they paired me
with so if you have similar skin to that
this might be a good option for you this
kit comes with seven of these products
and there are a few that were extras
that I'll tell you which ones are like
separate products but all of these are
also sold on their own the first thing I
do day and night is I use the cleanser
and I love that it's got a pump and you
know it's just a very milky type
cleanser it I mean I feel like it really
gets everything off I do remove my
makeup first so you could use I right
now using a cleansing oil but and there
are a ton online you can also use makeup
remover wipes I don't like to use the
wipes too much just because I feel like
I have to tug at my skin whereas with
the cleansing oils it kind of breaks
down the makeup when I'm gently rubbing
whereas with the wife I have to like
kind of pull on my skin so once I've
removed my makeup I use this cleanser
morning and night and I just love this
is now the second bottle I've had of
this I love this then I use the toner
and with toner you just grab like a
cotton pad and you scored some on it and
you're just it removes excess makeup and
anything else that might still be on
your skin what I notice with toners is
that for me it calms down any redness I
have so and that's been true for any I
don't like to have alcohol based toners
I used to use those and I realize that
it's like making my skin more red I
really like this one a lot then I use
this it's an exfoliator now when I used
to hear the word exfoliator I used to
think the kind with the microbeads and
you can use that kind just as like a
surface level level exfoliator but these
are more chemically based this is an aah
a and it's really good for dry skin and
it kind of
chemically mixes with your skin and gets
down in there and helps to get rid of
the dead layer of skin
chemically whereas you know those
exfoliator B type things just kind of do
a true surface level this really renews
your skin now this is 5% AJ they also
come it also comes with a 10% aah a and
this is supposed to be used weekly so
for me I just use it once on the weekend
typically on like Saturday night and
it's a higher concentration to really
get rid of it but you don't want to use
this every day so I use this one every
day that's more of a lotion it's got a
pump and this one is more of a liquid so
I scored it onto a cotton pad kind of
similar to the toner and I use that once
on the weekend so I really I like the
aah a for my skin type they have BHA as
well and that is better for if you have
oily skin it gets a little bit deeper
into your skin because this AJ's don't
typically get through like if you've got
really oily skin it won't get through
the oil clogged pores but I don't really
have the oily skin so it's not a problem
but if you do you want to you want to
try out a PHA so the next step is the
serum now what I'm using at night is
this it's a retinol serum
it's the resist intensive wrinkle repair
retinol serum now this doesn't come in
that kit it's a separate one but I love
the packaging and it's more of it's a
clear thick serum that you put on all
over your face and let it sink in and
brenell it's just so good at for
anti-aging the one thing I was told that
you want to be aware of with retinol is
if it's starting to dry your skin out
maybe don't use it as often she said you
should be fine to use it every single
day unless you're noticing it's drying
out your skin I have had no problems so
far and I've been using this for quite a
few weeks now so um but for the daytime
I use this and this does come in the kit
this is the super antioxidant
concentrate serum and again it's the
same texture where it's like a clear
thicker serum you just put it on and let
it sink into your skin and you do do the
do do you do put on the serum before
your moisturizer so once your serum is
sunk in that's when you apply your
moisturizer for the
day time I use the cellular defense
daily moisturizer it has an SPF of 25 I
love this again with moisturizers if
you're going to put foundation on top
you want to make sure you give it time
to really sink into your skin first for
nighttime this is one of my favorites
this is their barrier Repair moisturizer
it's got a pump again this is the second
bottle I've used of this this stuff is
absolutely incredible I have brought
this on vacations with me same with the
cleanser I'll squirt it into like
littler or smaller bottles to be able to
bring these with me because I love them
so much if I were to only get two
products it would be these two they're
my favorite um so the last thing is
another separate thing it doesn't come
in the kit and it's the vitamin C spot
treatment this is really good if you've
got I told her that one of my problems
is when I told you like when I'll have a
breakout it's very painful and they're
big and they just hurt this is meant to
once it's kind of gone down to lighten
that area it's a high concentration of
vitamin C it's 25% so you just put it on
that spot like right now I've got a dark
spot here that I'm just starting this
treatment on that that way it'll lighten
the area and get rid of it quicker than
if you were to not do anything so if you
have nagging dark spots from past
breakouts this would be an awesome
option because it pretty from what I
understand it should pretty quickly get
rid of it I haven't gotten to try it yet
and like I said I'm going to start
trying it on this so I'm excited to try
that out some more so those are what I'm
using right now I've been using most of
these products for some of them I'm
using for months and months and months
some of them I've been using for now a
few weeks and I just love them and again
they have so many different lines of
skincare you should really go to their
site and look at you know for your skin
type what would make the most sense for
you if you've got dry skin like I do I
think you love this if you don't have
dry skin you'd probably still like all
of this but they do have other lines
that are catered specifically for your
skin type which is just wonderful so
definitely check it out if you're not
looking to buy any skin care maybe you
already have a regimen you like
definitely go to their Beauty pedia and
check out what you
half already and see how they rate it
and why because there's so much to learn
and there's still so much for me to
learn
it's very illuminating when you look up
your products on there and you see like
wow this is good for my skin and it was
really cheap that's great or oh wow this
was really expensive and it's terrible
for my skin things like that is just
it's crazy so hopefully this video was
helpful for you guys if you have any
questions for me definitely comment them
below I will try to answer all of them
that are below because I know skincare
we all have a lot of questions about it
but we also all are you know we're
worried about our skin and where we want
to make sure we're doing what's best for
our skin so definitely ask me any
questions I'll try to answer them below
of course I'm not a skincare guru I
don't know that much but I do have a
little bit of knowledge up in here so
definitely ask away
subscribe for more videos like this and
I'll catch you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
