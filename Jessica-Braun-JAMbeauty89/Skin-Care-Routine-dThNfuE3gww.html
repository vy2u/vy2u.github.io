skincare routine video and I've held off
for a long time on doing a skincare
video really just because I hadn't
really fallen into her routine yet so I
think I finally kind of got the same
thing going on month after month and I'm
happy with it for once so I figured this
would be a great time to share it with
you guys especially right before the new
year just kind of like a maybe if you're
looking for maybe a new face wash or a
new makeup remover or something like
that would be a great time to start a
new routine so I will share with you
what I do of course keep in mind
everyone's skin is so so different so
something that works wonderfully for me
might be terrible for your skin so keep
that in mind but if you're someone
that's been watching me a while and you
know that a lot of the recommendations
I've given you have worked well for your
skin as well then you'd probably really
like a lot of these products so and all
of them are really inexpensive so you're
welcome okay so one of the first things
that I do when I'm washing my face at
night I really I wash my face at night I
really don't wash it in the morning I
noticed that when I used to do it
morning and night my skin would just get
really really dry as if even if I was
just kind of rinsing it off in the
morning it would just really affect my
skin in a negative way and it would be
really kind of blotchy so I finally just
stopped doing it in the morning if I get
in the shower in the morning it depends
on if I shower at night morning if I'm
in the shower in the morning I might use
this sponge that I'm going to show you
to kind of just help slop off some dead
skin cells but other than that I really
don't wash it in the morning okay so the
first thing that I do when I'm taking my
makeup off is I use some sort of
waterproof eye makeup remover I usually
don't use waterproof eye makeup but some
of it is just so difficult to get off
I'd rather just use the really strong
stuff and get it off in one swoop so
this is the all main long-wear and
waterproof eye makeup remover it's the
kind that has the oil in it so you have
to shake it I don't love this more than
I love any other one I really like the
Maybelline Express one I really like the
up-and-up brand one
the one I just finished before this so
for this I'm not that particular but I
do use some sort of with some sort of
makeup remover with a cotton pad just to
get it off I use one side and then I
turn it around get some more on it and
use the other that way I'm not wasting a
ton of these either so I just do that
really just to get my eye makeup remover
off or my eye makeup off and that's it
then I move on to some sort of makeup
wipe a lot of people will use a makeup
wipe to get their eye makeup off to this
I just don't because I'd rather just I
don't know I just never have because I
really haven't found one that I love to
get all of it off but this I love to get
my face makeup off and it's the FPL
brand green tea cleansing tissues they
have so many different kinds this one is
the collagen and vitamin E one that I
just discovered I buy these at Big Lots
for a dollar for a 30-pack hold on sorry
I'm like dropping all of my little
things um I really like these like I
said I don't use them to take my eye
makeup off though so if you're looking
for one that does that you might not
love these but they stay really moist
they do a great job getting your face
makeup off I just I love them and
they're so inexpensive oh my gosh so if
you have a big laughs new you go check
it out they have this kind is kind they
have aloe vera oh my gosh um green tea
is my favorite by far they had a citrus
one I wasn't a big fan of but they have
all kinds so um alright so after I take
my eye makeup off and my the rest of my
makeup off I typically then wash my face
with some sort of face wash now this is
something I'm excited to mention I've
been trying it out for a decent amount
of time because I really wanted to see
how it worked with my skin because it
seems weird this brand called dr. sponge
they set me on two of their sponges and
I was really skeptical at first because
I was very interested in them but I just
didn't understand how they worked they
come in they're hard as a rock and this
is the green tea one which is said to be
good for dry skin and the one in this
box is the pearl powder one and it's
good for dull or uneven skin this one I
haven't used yet actually because I
figured I would use one at a time but
the
I wanted to save this one for maybe the
spring summer but this they say they
last for like 2 or 3 months depending on
how often you use it I've been using it
for a few weeks now and I have dry skin
right here in the wintertime and
sometimes on my nose and it was really
bad so when they said that they were
gonna send these to me I was like ok
definitely a dry skin one would be great
so what you do is you take this it's
hard as a rock you just put it in your
sink turn on your hot water after about
30 to 45 seconds it'll get completely
soft and it'll grow just a little bit
and it'll be like a wet sponge now this
is made from natural things I where does
it say what it is it's so interesting ok
I'm going to probably butcher some
pronunciations cone konjac it's KO njaa
C cognac or cognac is an exotic plant
native to Asia for centuries it's been
used in varieties of Asian cuisines and
medicines for its natural richness and
protein vitamin potassium iron iron and
many skin benefiting ingredients which
are wonderful nutrition for healthy and
balanced skin so this is made with pure
and food-grade cognac or cognac fibre so
it's an all natural product and you guys
it is amazing I haven't had any dry skin
issues basically this entire month of
December it has been oh my gosh
in every winter I suffer from this dry
skin and so any foundation I put on no
matter how I apply it and always kind of
you know after a couple hours looks
really try up there I have had no issues
I mean none it is this is the first
thing I have discovered that works and
it's really really cheap I don't know
the exact price but I'll list it below
it's really inexpensive it's so exciting
so this is definitely something although
they sent me these for free I will be
buying this once I run out of this
because I've never seen anything like it
and I'm so glad that it's inexpensive so
I really like this for dry skin the
green tea one the pro powder like I said
it's for uneven adult skin tone so I'll
have to get back to you on how that
works but they come with like the little
rope so you can hang it in your shower
it's it's just fantastic and they say
you can use this with or without a
cleanser I've used it both ways so when
I use it in the shower I don't use it
with the cleanser I'll just use it to
get it off because by then I've already
my face anyway but if I'm using it
during my regular skincare routine I use
it with my favorite face wash which is
the johnson's baby head-to-toe wash now
i have a big huge one in my with like a
pump in my bathroom but this one i
usually fill up to take with me when i
travel however it always spills anyway
the reason I love this is because it is
the most gentle thing in the world if
you don't have really bad skin problems
or you don't have really bad acne but
you just notice maybe a little bit of
unevenness or just a few breakouts this
is wonderful it's just gentle it gets
everything out of your pores and out of
your skin it just feels fresh but it
doesn't feel too dry and Tuggy on your
skin and it's just so nice with this cuz
this gets rid of any dead skin cells
this cleans your pores it's just it's a
really nice just a sensitive way to
clean your skin now when I feel like I
do need a little bit more I reach for my
Palladio facial scrub I really do like
this and I mentioned it in my Palladio
video where I reviewed a ton of
different products that I do like this
it's formulated with aloe vera and green
tea clearly I like green tea because
this sponge is green tea my facial wipes
are green tea and this is drain tea but
I really I noticed it really does
wonders with my skin this has the like
the little exfoliating beads and it has
a really nice smell all the beads it's
not too rough but it's just the right
amount so when I notice maybe I've got
some blackheads or anything like that
I'll reach for this stuff just because
it's a little bit stronger but these are
my two favorite face washes and this
I've been using for years I just love it
okay so if I feel like I need before my
face wash if I feel like I have more
makeup on and maybe the wipes didn't do
well the toner that I typically use is
100% witch hazel this is Dickinson's
brand I bought this I think at Walgreens
Meyer sells it you can pretty much find
it anywhere it's inexpensive maybe a
couple bucks and it's just not it even
says it's non drying it doesn't dry your
skin I know a lot of other toners that
I've used for me they just really kind
of wreck up my skin so this is gentle I
don't use it all the time but if I feel
like maybe when I'm in a show and I wear
a lot of makeup I use this to make
sure before I wash my face I use this to
make sure I've gotten all the makeup off
especially here in my hairline and just
like in little crevices where it's not
as easy to get to so I use this with a
cotton pad and I'm good to go I've loved
this stuff it lasts forever okay so when
I do have a breakout which of course
happens all the time and it's usually in
this region I reach for my tea tree oil
and this is the brand Jason I bought it
at Meijer I think it sold a lot of
places you can get tea tree oil anywhere
you can get it at health food stores and
things like that but you'd be surprised
where you'd find it so it's pretty cool
this it smells like like peppermint
almost you know it's really really
strong I use a q-tip with it and all
usually it's really bad I'll just use it
straight up and all you get the sum on
the q-tip and just put it right on the
breakout technically you should put a
little bit of water on it so if it's not
that bad I'll put it like a drip of
water on it and drip of this because
this really is pretty harsh so you don't
want to be wiping your skin with it or
anything crazy like that but tea tree
oil I might do a whole video on all the
benefits of tea tree oil cuz there's so
much you can do with it it's kind of
insane but I really love a freak-outs it
dries them up overnight like crazy but
it's a more natural way to do that and
it smells good it's certainly strong but
it smells good so I love that now for
moisturizing my face I have a few
different things for my eye cream I'm
still using my Mogador nurturing eye
cream I bought this at Marshall's some
people have said they found it online
but just find an eye cream you really
like put it on morning and night that I
used to only do it at night but I
started to do it in the mornings because
you know I'm yes I know I'm only 24 but
you know you start to notice little
things and you really no matter what age
you are you should take care of your
skin so one great way to do that is to
moisturize especially in your under eye
area when I put it on I tap it on I
don't rub it or anything like that
because you do want to be gentle with
that skin you don't want to pull on it
and that's something I'm working on
because I didn't always do that but I'm
trying to be better about it I really
like this I love the way it smells it's
lasted me a long time just you really
don't have to use that much and I even
put it not only here but I even put it
here I remember when I was first taking
a makeup class like 5 or 6 years ago I
remember learning that when you get
older I was learning how to
you old people makeup you know to make
yourself look old not anyway I remember
learning that this skin here even starts
to kind of sag so right when I learned
that I was like I'm gonna start
moisturizing there too I don't know if
it'll help but I figure it's worth the
shot so I just moisturize all around
anyway okay so for my all-over face
moisturizer morning and night I use my
vital Kerr vitamin E cream I have talked
about this since I started my channel
it's like two dollars and 80 cents at
Big Lots big let's have some good
skincare items but this is my favorite
it's a huge jar it lasts me like half of
the year if not a whole year I'm almost
done with this one actually it's just
vitamin E cream it's simple as pie but
vitamin E is so good for your skin it's
just my skin once I started using this
about a year ago it was just like wow my
skin's actually soaking it in when I
wake up in the morning my skin still
feels nice and moisturize it's just it
lasts all day it works really well under
makeup it doesn't make you look too oily
if you have really oily skin it might
but I'm kind of a combo and it doesn't
make my skin look oily at all even if I
put it on right before I put on
foundation so you really don't have to
even let it sink in for that long I love
this stuff and it's so cheap from that
same brand vital care this is their
vitamin E oil you can get vitamin E oil
anywhere it doesn't have to be this
brand I use this when I'm really really
dry so I've used this a few times this
winter especially like I said in this
region where I get really dry it's just
a really concentrated vitamin E so you
could even take vitamin E oil and
probably I don't know how well of a mix
but I bet you can mix this with your own
moisturizer just to add a little bit
more so that's always a thought Royals
are just so great just like tea tree oil
because there's just so many different
ways of things you can mix them with and
you can just make your own kinds of
skincare things that you just that are
perfect for your skin that are catered
to your skin did I get through it all
that's my skincare routine I'm sure that
seemed long but I don't do every single
one of those every single day but just
to kind of show you the different ins
and outs of what I use and when I use it
and what problems I have and what to do
about them I hope that was helpful and
beneficial for all of you
I would love to know your skincare
secret
please list them below because then we
can all read them and learn even more
about different ways to take care of our
skin because our skin what I think isn't
it the largest organ in the body or is
