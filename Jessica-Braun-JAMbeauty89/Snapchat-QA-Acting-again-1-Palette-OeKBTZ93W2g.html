gonna do something different on my
channel I typically I'm doing you know
drugstore makeup reviews or hauls or you
know top 5 things but I
everyone smile do Q&amp;amp;A s but I've seen a
lot of people I need to do these
snapchat q and A's and they're so cute
to watch and it's so cool because I look
at least for me it always feels cool
opening your snapchats because I feel
like you know when I'm in a room alone
and I'm talking about makeup I feel like
I'm talking to a lot of people but I
also feel like I even talking to myself
so it is really exciting to actually
hear you guys and hear your voice and
see your face so I love getting snapchat
videos so I figured this is such a cool
way and I love I don't know who invented
this or came up with it but it's such a
cool idea so kudos to you I was so
excited to do it here on my channel so
let's go ahead and get into it please
just know that I am drinking wine
there's no standing I'm 26 years old
there's nothing wrong but I mentioned it
I filmed a few videos today which is
what I do since I teach and I have been
filming a lot today and this is my
second glass of wine so if I sound a
little goofy that might be why and if
anyone is offended by that I hope you're
not it's just wine but I'm just I
figured I would let you know is only
fair okay oh my gosh my favorite
eyeshadow pal actually I have it off
because I was talking about it in a
video I just filmed I think my number
one okay it's a tie
let me pull out the other one I used
both of these ah see I just looked at my
tour and I just saw much more money like
old like original prankster is this Too
Faced natural eyes palette and love it
so much there this is everything I would
ever need for a complete look like it's
got these matte shades over here a few
right there
just enough shimmery shades they're just
different enough that it is exactly what
you need and I travel all the time and
of course my husband has a travel
YouTube channel and he's in the works to
becoming a travel agent so we travel a
lot and so this is a problem that is so
trustworthy for me but another one and
this one I brought on my honeymoon to
Paris is the lorac Pro palette
both of these are expensive but you guys
it's worth it because they do have the
mash mate and the shimmery everything
you could ever ever ever need but I do I
think that the two-faced one might be a
little bit more favorite if you watch
Brian Regan's
um his stand-up he says you know Tara I
really like cherry but grapes more
favorite grapes more favorite so this
one's more favorite than this one but I
love them both by the way that chat was
that snapchat was from DN Papa's eight
one three love you do sweet oh my gosh
this is so fun okay so I own some home
I've done some videos on what I notify
I'll link it below this shadow is my
number one favorite this is their super
shock shadow and I heart this and I'm
wearing it on my lids today actually it
is the best glitter shadow I've ever
like true glitter not just shimmer but
if you want a glitter this is the king
I've never and it like actually stays on
its so I love it so much I just did my
wet and wild best and worst video where
I talked about like um you know the
there's this glitter that they have
that's just terrible and I I think I've
already gotten rid of it I just hate it
this one is amazing
there lippies are okay I like them I
don't not like them but they're a little
drying for my taste so I haven't found
that I what I have
one that kathleenlights did I think a
lot of people tell me I look like her
older sister but loo yeah Lumiere
Bursar's right that one is nice but it's
almost too dark for me I mean I know I
wear dark I don't really know how to
describe it but anyway I think it might
be eyeliner because like if I'm leaving
and I want to look at least semi put
together the one thing that I feel like
makes or breaks me is eyeliner like I
feel like my eyes just I mean they're
not the same without eyeliner I still
feel fine and I still feel beautiful
without makeup but if I want to feel at
least some I put together eyeliner is
like my one thing that I'm like I will
not go to work without eyeliner on and I
don't you know lipstick I love guys you
needed to tell me that the wine had made
the lipstick go I'm sorry about it you
need to tell me these things
but eyeshadow I can do without blush I
can do without highlight or bronze or
whatever eyeliner is kind of my thing
and my favorite eyeliner like buy can I
usually layer my eyeliner but if I can
only put one on it would be the sila
stay all day waterproof liquid eyeliner
this stuff is amazing it does not budge
I'm wearing today I wore it on my
wedding day I love it and that was from
Vanessa ah x3 by the way this next one
is from Lily van Lew 10 you so sweet you
so beautiful all of you things are so
beautiful
huh I think my favorite like my favorite
thing to do when I'm doing my makeup I
would say is my lips and I feel I'm
trying to be better about actually
wearing lipstick to work not that it
matters but I'm like I've got so much
lipstick and I love it but I feel like
oh there's slap on chapstick and go
because I know I've already wished it
but I
so it's I'm a fifth grade teacher I
don't have the time to be putting it on
even during my prep you to my lunch I'm
grading papers I'm talking to parents
I'm doing you know a million other
things but I'm trying to be better about
using because I do love lipsticks so I
think that really is my favorite thing
about makeup this one is from Cairo CFG
let's see I have not been to Grand
Rapids I've been to Khaled Michigan with
my family we rented a lake house up
there and it was one of the little I've
traveled a lot but that was one of my
favorite trips I've ever taken Michigan
is beautiful and we also went to like
the Sleeping Bear Dunes there in
Michigan which isn't too far from
Cadillac but I have never been to Grand
Rapids I would be interested to and I'm
sure one day we will so hopefully I will
see you there this one is from Leslie
iCloud hi this is sweet I remember I
started wearing makeup when I was in
middle school so probably around 12 or
13 and I didn't I mean I didn't wear all
that I wear no I didn't even wear this
much in high school but I just remember
my mom you know she kind of talked to me
about it and said you know you want your
makeup to look natural and that's always
stuck with me and even today she'll
still tell me that of course right now
I'm wearing bright pink lips and I wear
but you know compared to a lot of
youtubers I do wear a lot more of
natural makeup and I pride myself in
that because that's something that my
mom has really instilled in me and it's
one of my favorite things my mom has
instilled in me and she wears makeup
every single day she never leaves the
house without it she always looks so
beautiful because it's very very natural
and so when I was like 12 or 13 in
middle school I remember wearing like I
was in place so like in plays that we
wear like bright blue eyeshadow
and I didn't know what I was doing but I
loved it I'm a bright blue eye shadow or
I remember I used to take like a white
like eyeliner pencil and just color in
my lid with just white and that would be
it looks so good terrible but um but
that's what I love so you know then I
really didn't know what I was doing and
I really wasn't natural looking back I
wish I would have scaled it back but I
mean that's what middle schools for you
experiment with you know those little
things but I always wore lip gloss I
didn't wear lipstick but I would wear
clear lip gloss I know I didn't want
blush or anything like that but I really
started getting a little more into
makeup in high school where I wear a
little more liner and mascara I didn't
wear eyeliner and mascara really in
middle school and I don't think you need
to I teach fifth grade and my students
I've noticed a few of them will wear
they'll wear lip gloss which is cute you
know but I don't they don't really wear
anything else and they're all so
beautiful and I wouldn't change that
about them and part of me I wish I would
have waited a little longer to wear
makeup because that when you're younger
your skin is so perfect and you're
you're just perfect we all are perfect
during way the middle schoolers and L
imagine your skin is perfect you don't
need make-up for as long as you can wait
just wait I love makeup but you just
don't need it okay this one is from
little teacher tech it's te IC h09 oh
I'm sorry dude that got in the way and I
love you too one foundation right now in
sixpence I hate to say it but I'm going
to give you a drugstore option did you
know that's the way I roll sorry I read
where everything is okay so I would say
my favorite high-end foundation that I'm
wearing today guy glove is this gorgeous
cosmetics foundation their base perfect
liquid foundation I have in the shade
one NB VP it is amazing amazing but my
favorite drugstore is the Revlon
Colorstay whipped and I have it in 150
buff however I think I need to go like
to 200 or maybe 180 it is amazing it
just looks beautiful on your skin I love
it so much so I couldn't pick one I just
can't this is from Hannah Kat 2001 hi
Hannah I've seen you on snapchat
actually quite a bit thank you you know
you have the best brows I'm diggin those
like
brows okay right step out before left I
had to think about when I run I
literally wear socks and no other time
than when I'm running I guess I wear
with boots but it's been a while and
then tacos or burritos tacos all the way
that sounds so good Tyler's making Thai
though what are you making tonight
what's it called
that's it Hungarian Goulash and I'm so
excited we always try and make like
different
that's nothing to do with this but
anyway why am I talking oh yes it does
and I'm so excited to try it's got like
some meat and has got some potatoes and
just some spices and I am very excited
but I love tacos I love burritos - but
tacos this is from Alexandria okay if
you don't know we went to Paris we've
logged every single day on our honeymoon
it was a three week uneven every single
day is on my husband Tyler's channel
I'll link it below
it's a shameless plug because AI love
him be he's amazing and this travel
videos are amazing but all of our blogs
are there if you're like wanting to see
even just one video but we went to Paris
then we went to Disneyland
and then we went to Disney World in
Florida we've been to Disney World
million times but we say that the crabby
flirty in which we usually stay at the
value resorts because duh but we were
like well let's flirt or just our
honeymoon so we say that the Grand
Floridian my favorite part okay
I'm gonna break it down to a moment my
favorite moment on our honeymoon was in
Paris the river there we were saying
nearer the Sun River and one night like
you can just have a but it might be
illegal there I don't know but speaking
of wine you can just have a bottle of
wine and just open it in public and just
like drink it so we were we just had
this bottle of wine we open and we did
that like everywhere in France but there
was this one night it was like the night
before we left and we had a bottle of
wine we had some bread and cheese and we
were just sitting on the river and it
was like probably midnight and there
were a lot of people still out and so we
were just drinking the wine we were just
talking about maybe one day moving there
and I don't know if it'll ever happen
but you know if I could ever just do
YouTube for a job and he's working
towards just doing YouTube for a job as
well we'd have so much more freedom and
with that freedom we would love to
travel and maybe live in other places
other than Indiana we've both lives here
or whole lives I guess I did live in
Chicago for a couple years for college
but and so we were just talking about
that what our lives would be like and
there was something about that moment
with it just being dark and Moon was out
and it was so romantic and just you know
we drank probably a glass worth of Y and
we were working on our second and the
water was so beautiful with the lights
in Paris and oh my gosh something about
that moment was so perfectly romantic
and kind of existential in its own way
and it was amazing thank you for asking
that question it was nice to reminisce
this question is from kso 89 euros there
is no balance I literally I have to
stuff all of my YouTube excitement and
delight my weekend so I can't film
during the week
tried but with full time I used to be
able to do when I was student teaching
but with teaching for real there's no
way because I'm lesson planning grading
talking to parents emailing there's what
there's too much there's just too much
so keeping that in mind I just can't I
can edit on a few weeknights and that's
what I'll put them up but that's why
you'll see you hit my life saving
wonderful outfit whatever I picked for
that weekend and I'll build like two or
three videos and that's it for the week
so that's my balance but like I
mentioned I would love to do this
full-time eventually I don't the time is
not right yet but I think eventually it
will be and I'm excited for that time
but I do love teaching so it's been
interesting balancing it but it works
and Tyler helps me alive they'll help me
with you know like helping me focus the
camera and getting the light and that
helps me a lot because I'm not I'm tech
savvy to a point but he really does know
a lot so he helps me big-time there is a
fly in here this one is from mums the
word 83 okay well same thing I had
mentioned and I figured I'd get a lot of
questions about this because there are a
lot of teachers in this world a lot of
people that like beauty as well watch
beauty videos I think it's just the
balance you know like there's so many
times that I like I maybe would have I
maybe I went shopping for makeup the
night before and I go to work and I'm
like I want it like I want to film the
video so badly but by this time I get
almost retired and you know the lights
not quite the same so doesn't work so
it's just finding the time and and
trying to stuff it into one session of
filming if you will when really what I
want to be doing is filming a couple
times a week like I love it I love
clearly I love it because I started this
a couple of years ago because I love it
so much so it's hard to kind of almost
stifle that into just one weekend hi
Jess my question is
do you entirely think about doing
theater again yes and like I mentioned
before if we ever did do YouTube as our
career which one day we will and I like
to think that way then we would be able
to because like I said our schedule
would be freed up so the problem is a
lot of rehearsals are either during the
day which is not even an option so like
professional theaters near us that we've
done before and if you live in India
we've done like beef Awards before if
the rehearsals are during the day for
like a week and a half so there's an I
can't get off that much time at work
neither can he so there's no way whereas
if we had a free schedule we could do
that when we wanted so it leave be our
own boss so definitely when that day
comes we would definitely want to now
community theater wise we actually just
saw a little women here in town which is
the show I did a long time ago which I
loved it was kind of one of my like
favorite favorite shows favorite roles
I've ever played Joe March but we were
invited to see and I guess they saw a
subscriber there which was so cool and
very very surreal so hi if you're
watching thank you for coming up to me
and saying that you knew who I was
because it was very surreal for me as
well but we definitely talked about it
we both love theater that's how we met
it's one of our passions I went to
school for musical theater for like two
and a half three years in Chicago that's
how much I love it I have a lot of
student loan debt because of it but yes
one day we will but right now with our
jobs so that's just the problem there's
no way now I don't know that either one
of us want that to be our main career I
mean it'd be awesome if it was but it's
more it's more fun to me when it's
something I'm choosing to do for fun
rather than having to do it because it's
my job because I need the money it kind
of takes away the fun of it and that's
what I noticed when I was doing some
professional theater I was like I'm
taking these roles that I don't even
want to play just because I need the
money or I need you know or I need the
experience whereas if I'm choosing to do
it just for fun then I'm picking or I'm
accepting the roles that I want to play
I'm doing it because I just enjoy doing
it so that's what I want to get back to
oh this video is getting really long so
I'm gonna have to cut it off there but
hopefully I'll be able to do another one
of these here soon in the future let me
know if you enjoyed this video down
below in the comments and any other
questions you might have for me I like
doing Q&amp;amp;A videos I don't do them often
enough I don't think especially as I
gain more subscribers a lot of you guys
don't know things about me that I take
for granted that you already know like
the fact that I was in theater the fact
that I'm a teacher in fact that I just
got married the fact that I travel a lot
you know I think a lot of those things I
assume you know because subscribers that
have been subscribed to me they've seen
videos and q and A's in the past but I
need to know that a lot of you guys
don't know that stuff about me so
definitely keep the questions coming if
you enjoyed please subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
