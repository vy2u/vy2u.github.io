do a comparison video between two of the
exact same product but different shades
so I will be comparing with swatches the
Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre versus the
Mac Paint Pot in painterly let's go
ahead and get into it so the reason I
wanted to make this video is because
when I was trying to buy a Paint Pot
originally I was looking not just for a
cream shadow but I was looking for a
shade that would get rid of like any
veining or discoloration on my eyelid
before I put eyeshadow on but also that
would stay in place and hold the
eyeshadow so it doesn't crease so it
doesn't wear off so I knew I wanted to
get these I knew they were really good
but I wasn't sure what shade to get for
my skin tone so if you're close to my
skin tone this video is going to be
helpful if you're a really deep skinned
person this might not be helpful because
these aren't going to be really neutral
colors for your skin let's start with
the first one I ever bought which was
painterly now this one as you'll see in
the swatch has a little bit more of a
pink tone to it so it's a little bit
more cool and so you know if you swatch
it kind of on your wrist on your hand
honestly anywhere you could do it on
your neck like people say you'll pretty
quickly see if it meshes well with your
skin or not it's not supposed to be like
a foundation but if it's completely
different than your skin then it's not
going to give you the effect you want of
just an eye primer
whereas soft ochre as you'll see in this
watch has a little bit more of a yellow
base to it so this is going to be great
if you have a more warm skin tone now to
be honest I lean a little warm but I'm
kind of almost neutral so for me they
both work however when I run out of
these I will be repurchasing soft ochre
because I've decided that I like the
look of the little bit more yellow tone
on my skin because I do pull a little
bit warmer so if you're kind of neutral
you could really pull either one off
it's not going to look any different so
if you know that your cool tone paint
really is the perfect choice for you if
you know your warm tone soft ochre is
I'll show you the swatches side by side
right now you can tell even on my skin
soft ochre really does blend just a
little bit better
to my skintone you can't go wrong either
way but just know yourself you can
swatch it if you're out of mat counter
that's probably the best bet but if
you're ordering online which is what I
did I mean the swatches are pretty true
to exactly how they are if you're a lot
deeper they have other colors you can
look at on the site and I'm sure there
are other youtubers that have talked
about the deeper tones but I love both
they're both creamy they kind of have
like a it's a very slight scent but it
almost smells like a little bit like
frosting but it's so slight you can
barely tell but I know that it has a
scent so I smelled all the time just cuz
I liked it but you wouldn't notice it
otherwise they really do hold on the
shadow all day I had rubenesque for a
while but it was really glittery and
like almost orange and it looked weird
on me so I ended up getting rid of that
one I had bear study but bear study is
kind of like if you mix these two but it
also has like shimmery glitter in it and
I just it kind of just looked like a
wash of nothing on my eyelid so I ended
up getting rid of that one too after
after a while because I was like it's
not really doing anything whereas these
do exactly what they claim I always
travel with one of them because they're
amazing these retail for $22 they are
sold matte counters of course and
department stores also on Macs website I
always buy mine on Nordstrom because I
can use Ebates for get money for it it's
like for buying it and then they have
free shipping on or trims website anyway
and I just always order high-end makeup
from there I don't know why I just
always free shipping it gets here
quickly and there's never been any
issues so um plus like I said I get
Ebates from it so it's a win-win so
hopefully this review in comparison was
helpful for you guys I will link my
other review and dupe videos if you're
curious about maybe like cheaper
versions of this I will link goes down
below and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
