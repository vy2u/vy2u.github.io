my essentials for spring video so the
first essential and thing that I love to
wear in the springtime are espadrilles
or wedges and these are some Steve
Madden wedges they have like a taupe
colored straps here and I love that
there's the ankle strap they're just so
cute and chunky and they're actually
surprisingly comfortable and honestly I
don't know that I've ever owned or even
met a pair of wedges that weren't
comfortable so I don't know what it is
about like the way that they're
structured but for some reason they're
really comfortable to me I think you'd
be surprised so if you've never tried
wedges or espadrilles on you might be
surprised at how comfortable they are
or maybe you won't I don't know but for
me they seem to be pretty darn
comfortable which which is surprising
given like the height of some of them
and the fact that there's like a little
platform up here but these are
surprisingly comfortable and I really
love those and of course I got those on
sale at Nordstrom Rack I think for like
a really really good deal ok another
thing that I love all year round but
especially in the springtime are like
sense in the car and this actually my
boyfriend's mom got me it's this cute
little bath and Bodyworks
it's I think these are called scent
portables and there's so many they have
like little animals they have so many
different kinds but I love this one
because it's got like these little the
little bow and the sparkly pink it's so
cute and you can clip these on your
visor like up in your car or mine
actually fits right in my cup holder so
I can see the cute little thing and it
fits perfectly in there in the scent
that's in there now is lavender vanilla
and it smells so so good it's such a
spraying clean scent um so if you like
those types of cents you'll love
lavender vanilla oh I love it
speaking of cents this is the carried
away
body lotion from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and
this is one of those smells that when I
first smelled it I was like nope not for
me but the more I smelled it my roommate
at the time actually owned this and wore
it a lot and the more I smelled it the
more I grew to like is now I love it and
actually I think this is one that she
got me and I've had it for a while but I
just recently started using
again and oh it smells so good I wonder
if they have a candle in this scent if
you know that they have a candle about
the body works in that carried away
scent let me know down below because I I
genuinely really really want one smells
so fresh but like sweet at the same time
it's a really nice mixture of smells um
I also use body sprays a lot more in the
spring than I would other times of the
year and in the summer as well because
perfumes they're just a little bit
heavier and musky ER and so when it's
you know nice and breezy out I don't
necessarily always grab for perfumes I
usually will reach for body sprays more
often than not so this is sold at
Victoria Secret but it's also sold a
bath and Bodyworks it's the pink line of
body sprays and this is in the scents
wheat and flirty and it smells exactly
like that sweet and flirty and it just
it smells really nice it actually
reminds me a lot of that carried away so
go figure and then one last smell oh
that's not true there's okay so this is
the body scrub also from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works it's in the scent pink chiffon and
this might be my all-time favorite scent
from them ever and if you haven't
smelled it you guys you need to make a
pit stop frankly because the last four
things I've shown it been from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works sorry but this is their
glowing body scrub in that scent and
it's it's you know a nice coarse
material just for exfoliation in the
shower but the scent smells incredible
and I have the lotion in this smell as
well and oh it smells so so good again a
really nice bright scent for spring
another thing that I love to wear in the
spring are just fun bright and colorful
earrings these I bought from shop lately
calm and I'll have a link down in the
comment box and I think I've linked at
the past couple videos because it is my
favorite website for jewelry you get
like I think these were like four or
five dollars and what's nice is if you
buy more than one item from one seller
on there and my favorite seller on there
is glint and gleam because they always
have the cheapest but cutest and
funkiest jewelry but if you buy more
than one thing from one seller you only
have to pay for shipping once so if I
buy four pairs of earrings that shipping
is I think 290
I only have to pay $2.99 one time for
all of those so that's always nice
because you know shipping on other
websites can get so pricey it just seems
ridiculous to be paying for earrings and
pay like more for shipping than needed
for the actuary's but I really love
these these are bright it's not picking
up the color well that kind of is it's
like a bright fuchsia pink and I really
really love those and let me think I
think I got this from if you can even
see it from shop lately as well and
these I don't think are from shop lately
okay so also this candle I've been
loving and guess what it was only a
dollar ninety-nine it's in the cents off
cotton blanket and this is from the
brand candle light I think that they
might sell this brand at like Walgreens
and CVS I got it at a local store near
me called Meijer so if you have a minor
near you great but I don't think many
people - but it's so cheap and so I was
thinking you know maybe it won't be that
great but it is surprisingly fragrant
when I like this it I mean my whole room
smells really really good so if you like
cotton II smells you'll like this and I
honestly haven't liked cottony smells
but for some reason this one is just
it's just right you know what I mean it
is just right and it just makes me think
of like breezes blowing in the window
and like fresh laundry and just like all
those quintessential spring things all
wrapped in up into one candle and I love
it okay so oh another thing that I love
to wear in the springtime is just like a
breezy scarf like one of those like
really thin sheer scarves so this one I
actually bought from shop lately calm as
well I know I'm like an advocate I I
just love that website like genuinely
but this is so cute it's got like this
you know sort of animal print but then
it's got these bright fuchsia hearts on
it and so when it's all wrapped up you
can't really tell what it is but it's
just got these bright pops of pink in it
and it's just so flowy and sheer and
light and I just love scarves like this
for spring so definitely check them out
I know that they've got a lot and I'm
pretty sure I only paid like five
dollars for this it was so inexpensive
another thing I love to wear just like
light cardigans and this one is from New
York and company and I think one of my
best friends bought this for me
Emily anyway but it's just so cute and
it's bright and I love that there's like
the
pink and then the bright like mango
orange and then like this taupe color in
the middle it's just cute and they're
comfortable to just throw on you know if
you're gonna be out in the evening just
nice okay almost done so some of my
favorite spring nail polishes I'm
wearing one of them today and I posted a
picture on Instagram I think it's fresh
paint I'm pretty sure I took that
picture with my nails still wet so that
was some seriously fresh paint so this
is the Sally Hansen complete salon
manicure in Barracuda and it's just a
nice like robin's egg blue like I
wouldn't call it baby blue and it's
definitely not mint green I don't know
how it's coming across on the camera
it's definitely not a mint green but it
is just this nice baby blue oh I just
love it I love the consistency of these
the complete salon manager line another
one that I was wearing the other thing I
think I talked about is the Revlon
charming nail polish I just love it's a
nice lavender and then this is I just
like the pastel yellows this brand I'm
not a huge fan of but I just love the
color
this is julep and it's this buttercup
yellow and I think oh it's in the shade
Blake but it's just a nice buttercup
yellow just reminds me of flowers and
then another one this is the Revlon
strawberry cream and this is one of
their scented ones and if you haven't
tried their scented perfumes you're in
for a treat
because when you paint your nails with
it you don't necessarily notice it right
off the bat but as your nails are drying
whatever scent like this is strawberry
cream so this smell like strawberries
and cream it smells like that it is
amazing and I own like three or four of
them and they smell so good but of
course the downside is after about a day
and a half the scent isn't really there
but for that day and a half it's like
dreamland it's like I'm smelling mine
this isn't scent it I'm just I wish it
was I would be awesome it is amazing and
seriously though if you haven't tried
these you should try them because
they're so cool but if they have it
literally will say scented parfum I'm
butchering it anyway but yeah it's
wonderful
so okay some of my favorite spring lip
products that I know some people I'm
requested to know I'm wearing one of
them right now it's in Revlon it's the
revlon colorburst lip gloss in papaya
and it's just like
it's not too bright but it is a little
bit of a pop of color it's just a nice
like coral color I can swatch it for you
even though I would look better on my
lips which that's where it is anyway
okay so that's the papaya it's just a
nice bright color kind of a no-fuss lip
gloss you know you can throw it on and
it does the trick this is um a bright
lipstick it's I'm not sure what this
line was called if you know what it was
called let me know but I know it was one
of the color sensational but I think
this line had a specific but it's
Maybelline and it's in the shade fruit
punch and it's just this nice like
almost sheer red like it's there but it
has like a sheer tone to it and it kind
of smells fruity not really but a little
bit but maybe that's my mind playing
tricks on me dude does that ever happen
to you happens to me way too often and
then also the Revlon kissable balm stain
in this one is in darling and it's like
a purple tone and it doesn't look
fantabulous on my skin tone on my lips
but for people with darker skin tones
this would look incredible it definitely
has a purple tint to it but seriously if
you have tanner skin to me or dark skin
this would be beautiful on you so you
should give it a try and again these are
so long-lasting they smell like mint I
swear the color stays on for like ten
hours it's incredible um oh I love it
and I think those are all my spring
essentials and I hope that you enjoyed
watching this I hope you enjoyed it as
much as I enjoyed making this video
because it's a lot of fun to go around
and find the things that you love and
then talk about them for a while um but
anyway so yeah again leave comments down
below with videos that you'd like to see
me make and I really appreciate all of
you that have subscribed and I hope all
of you will subscribe if you've enjoyed
