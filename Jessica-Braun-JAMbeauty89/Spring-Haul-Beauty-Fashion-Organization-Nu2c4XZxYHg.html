like seventy thousand minute long video
for you okay so I'm gonna go through I
actually filmed this the other day and
it was it ends up being like three
videos long I was like forget it I'm
putting it all together the footage was
kind of weird and part of it didn't get
taped and I was like oh my gosh it's one
of those things I was just so frustrated
I was like I'm gonna sleep and I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow and we're gonna do this
again and I'm just putting it all in one
because I just think it's gonna be
easier because there's so many great
companies and products that I want to
tell you guys about but none of them
makes sense alone kind of so we're just
gonna do it so we're gonna start with
the thing that's right in front of me
agave healing oil they sent me this trio
and it came with a shampoo conditioner
and then an oil treatment that comes
with it all of these are made from the
agave plant and that ship basically to
keep it simple at the shampoo and
conditioner is a little bit too heavy
for my hair my hair is very oil prone so
by like the second day even dry shampoo
doesn't cut it like it's pretty it's
pretty darn oily but for that first day
with it it's beautiful so if you don't
have oil prone hair or if you wash your
hair everyday then you'll love it
because it's great for that one day I
will say if I were to only if I didn't
want to buy the trio and I just wanted
one of the things I would just buy the
oil treatment because it I think this is
the miracle worker you know it's just
it's really luxurious it does again wear
your hair down I wish they would come
out with like a light version I think
that would be best
but I'll link the trio and agave
products down below if you're interested
I really really like them I might
repurchase the oil I don't think I would
buy the shampoo conditioner not for my
hair anyway but it's definitely D
frizzing if you've got a lot of problems
problems with frizz you will love that
trio
okay the next thing I want to talk about
is a brand of brushes I've never ever
heard them talked about here on YouTube
they're called diva brushes and again
the link will be down below you guys
know that I'm a Sigma affiliate and yet
I love these brushes and I think that
they're better than Sigma and
kicker is there so much cheaper so they
sent me to different kids I picked out
the contour kit which comes with the bo
5 precise contour the bo 7 round contour
and then the bo 6 pointed contour these
are all amazing I don't really use them
for contouring I use this one for
contouring and it looks like that NARS
eita or Ida brush that's always sold out
that cost like a million dollars this
entire kit I wrote it down is $28 and
you can buy the brushes separately but
they're $28 for the kit this contour
brush unbelievable I don't have contour
on today but and if you notice my eyes a
little red I've got allergies really bad
right now so I'm like trying not to each
them and I've used eye drops but it's
just past the point of no return anyway
I really really like the bo6 contour
brush for setting my under eye actually
and then this round contour actually
really like for highlight so you know
I'm using them for whatever I want but
the quality is unbelievable
they have diva beauty like itched into
this really pretty rose gold ferrule and
they're just heavy they literally are
nicer than Sigma brush and they're way
cheaper and the other kid they sent me
was their basic eye kit this runs for
$15 for the kit you can also buy them
separately and they have a ton of other
different kids all of them are gonna
expensive the kit comes with the so5
eyes shader the so7 Pro blender and
they're so six tapered blender I love
them all I use them all you can tell
they're dirty they're dirty I've been
using these like crazy I was like I
don't even have time to clean these I
use them every single morning I love
them oh my gosh I love them so I also
place an order on shop lately comm one
of my favorite sites and look at the
purse that I got oh my gosh this
everything keeps falling the way I am so
obsessed with this purse its small which
I love because the satchel that I have
now is kind of bigger but I love that
it's structured in this one structured
as well but not too structured and look
at the print inside is that not
absolutely adorable I think this was $30
oh I love it
so it's just this really cute color they
had it in a few other colors as well it
comes with the strap that you can use or
take off if you want but I just love
this so
munch there's not a ton of storage space
there's just a zipper here and then
someone's up here as well but that's
about it but the days that I'm using a
smaller purse like this I don't need
that much storage space anyway but what
I love is the company this came from on
shop lately was glamour Adi not
glamorous eva glamour Adi and they sent
a handwritten note and they don't know
that I'm like on YouTube I'm just like
to them I'm just a random shopper which
I mean I am anyway but you guys know
what I mean so it's not like they just
did this special for me they I think
they just do this for everyone so they
wrote a handwritten note and it says
thank you for your order we hope you
enjoy your purse and a little surprise
too they send an adorable little scarf
just for free didn't order it just
ordered the purse anywho so that was
awesome so love that seller holy crap
but this purse obsessed obsessed perfect
for spring and summer can't wait to use
it to death it's gonna be torn up by the
end of the summer because I'm gonna use
this like crazy so I will link this
below for sure oh my gosh
so I also ordered an Erin Condren
planner oh my gosh now before you get
too excited and you want to buy one
right now they're not selling them
anymore for this year you have to wait
to order for next year I must have
gotten it just in time because I still
got this year and it only includes like
I think May yeah May through the April
through the end of the year so off to
order a new one dove for next year but
you get to choose and personalize and
I'm gonna do a whole video on this with
how I organize it because it's oh my
gosh oh it's very exciting if you like
organization and stationery you're gonna
be obsessed like I am so I can't wait to
do a video on that eventually I also
placed a few orders on HauteLook no
surprise there I know so you a lot of
you guys if you follow me on Instagram
or Twitter I always post when there's a
really good deal on there because there
have been I ordered some stuff from
Laura Geller I got the spackle tinted
under makeup primer which this actually
all of these will our gala products you
saw if you saw my everyday makeup drawer
cuz I put them all in there this is the
Laura Geller lip spackle which it's just
a nude colored kind of lip thing that
new mutes out your lips so then you can
put lip color on top of it I also got
these
this is the laura geller cheek duo I
also got the balance and bronze and fair
which is just that you know glitter it
has balance and brighten on one side and
the bronzer on the other and then I also
got the balance and Brighton in fair
which I can't stop using this product
here all of those were like 60% off or
50% off so I got all of them for way
cheaper than like probably the price of
just one of these on a normal site then
they had a josie maran on there and I
was like well I gotta because I love
their cleansing oil so I got a pack of
two of the smaller size these are the
1.9 fluid ounce for like $12 which
that's insane the big one is like $45 so
I can just pour these in the big one
here is the downside though this is
argan cleansing oil for body does anyone
know if they have the same ingredients
for the one for face because I've never
even seen this and I just thought it was
the one cuz their package is exactly the
same so if you know please let me know
if this is really truly only for body or
if it's the same ingredients as their
face oil because i'm hoping i also got
this josie maran argan balm which is
really just a kind of waxy feeling bomb
I've only used it like once cuz I just
got it but it smells like wax don't
really have a smell but it's infused
with argan oil
cuz I had to use this like on my
cuticles I think this will be really
nice in the fall and winter honestly but
again like five bucks on they're so
cheap and then this was a little duo
it's a cheap stick Argan color stick and
red carpet which the packaging it's all
like beautiful rose gold and beautiful
but look at the color on that
isn't that pretty I just really really
liked that color I just thought it was
really really simple especially for a
spring in summer which obviously that's
the time it doesn't know and then I also
got this Argan illuminizer which is this
is really really pretty I'm gonna mix it
with foundation see how it looks I think
it'll be really nice another okay this
is just a fun one so this company called
splendas they're a like subscription
service and I'm trying to make sure I
have them all but I do you get three
pairs of undies for I think it's $12 a
month but I have a four dollar off
coupon code
you get it for $8 a month and you can
cancel it any time but these are the
pair once you choose your size you know
they can send it to you these are the
three pair they got me or sent me this
one adorable this one my favorite and
then the last pair are these gray ones
which I think are so cute oh so I think
that's a pretty good deal all have that
linked below as well so I also went to
Target I got a lot of things but I'm
just gonna show you guys the shoes
because a lot of the stuff I got on
clearance and it's not gonna be easy to
find now so I figure it's not right it
wasn't nothing was that exciting really
but I needed some new black flats so I
went and just got these these are the
Massimo Supply Company they're simple
black flats they're just fantastic they
seem they seem to get better made each
time I buy one because I always get
plain flats from there and every time I
get them they seem even more well-made
so yeh these I am so excited about and
this is like the only pair of shoes I
bought full price in a long time these
are the Moroni I have no idea what
they're called but they're this like
light gene material kind of like a light
denim and there's a slight heel I mean
but not really and oh my gosh they're
just so cute and they're so flattering
on I think because of this ankle strap
they make your leg look really thin and
it gives you that little bit of heel so
it gives a little bit of height but I am
just in love with these and then and I
think these are still like 25 or 30
dollars but these were on clearance for
ten dollars originally 20 but I had to
show them to you oh my gosh
are these not so adorable what I love is
that they have this nude strap so they
all know it almost like disappears on my
skin and then it's just got this really
pretty detail I am so in love with those
had this young alright so I also got and
Influenster box and this was a Fitness
one and I think if I can find the car it
was called the go yes the go box box hmm
so it's got a list of things first of
all first thing made me laugh so hard
because this is like the third
influencer box where I've gotten tampons
tampons yet again please export yeah it
again would I complain never in a
million years because boy do I need him
every single month so
like if this could just keep happening I
just won't ever have to buy them that
would be great right ladies anyway so it
also came with a I guess it was supposed
to have a Mueller I probably said that
wrong
yogurt product but came at the free
coupon so you can just go pick it up for
free cuz obviously they can't really
send that to you know alright it's got
this pro foot pedal rock what it says
squeeze me I'm soft it is kind of soft
it's just this huge thing to remove
calluses and dry skin well boy this is
for runners this is really nice cuz I
just signed up for that mini marathon of
course it's in a year but I'll certainly
be training up until then so that's
gonna be really nice also came with this
aqua spa relaxed body cream lavender and
chamomile full-size that's for sure it
smells like hay oh no it is open oh it

I forgot how much I like lavender I used
to have one of those Yankee Candle
lavender ones and I loved it okay it
also came with these Blue Diamond
blueberry oven roasted almonds how fun
skippity do I'll probably love them
alright umm this is I think these go
together so the brand is the vitamin
shop and it's their next step this is
like a shaker but the one that the thing
that's inside it is like shaped like a
jack so I wonder if it's gonna like mix
better we'll see and then it came with
