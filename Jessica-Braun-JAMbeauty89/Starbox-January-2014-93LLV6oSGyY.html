unboxing and unboxing of the star box
for January 2014 and they've been kind
enough to send me I think this is my
third one from them and it's kind of
cool because last month's was this
eyeshadow palette and I loved it and I'm
still using it all the time it was their
New Year's Eve 2014 palette and I just
all of these colors are perfect is there
like the fun ones and then the neutral
one and they were kind of up to 70 this
ones as well and it's $15 a month you
get three to four full-size products now
they're all from their brand which is
called starlooks
and what I think is kind of fun about
this is that it's a brand that most
people haven't heard of so it's kind of
fun to like be on the cutting edge of it
honestly I mean it really is kind of
cool and so far I've been so impressed
with their quality now their products on
their own are really really expensive
like this eyeshadow palette is a $99
eyeshadow palette could never would that
be I mean that's so much money but the
thing about Starbucks is you're paying
$15 and that's what I got for my box so
essentially I got it for $15 even though
they sent it to me for review but you
get what I'm saying so each box is 15
and like this one for example comes with
four or five different things so okay
they always have info inside and like I
said that's what I'm saying everything
is really pricey on its own but when
you're getting like three or four
different products in one box you're
only paying $15 you're definitely
getting your money's worth and so far
everything I've tried has been really
high-quality so I'm excited to see what
they've sent this month so the first
thing I've noticed is the eyelashes now
you guys know me and know how I'm not
really the eyelash Queen I really never
wear them and it's kind of funny because
I used to wear them all the time for
shows and like you know if I was dancing
or acting in show or if it was show
choir
I was always wearing eyelashes I wonder
if I just got I just got tired of him
you know so I literally never ever wear
them but maybe I'll hold on to these and
actually if I ever do want to wear them
at least have some so they look nice and
then also a little mini nail file
perfect for the purse actually my nails
I need
do my nails anyway okay so another thing
that they sent was now this looks like
one I've gotten before the star looks
infinity eyeliner but it's in the shade
Milky Way last time it was like a blue
one this one oh it's like a white color
okay so this is more like a cream shadow
it's an eyeliner or cream shadow
obviously I would probably wear this oh
my gosh look at that iridescent oh my
gosh this reminds me of like the NYX
jumbo eye pencil of course that's in a
pencil form and milk but it's like an
iridescent version of it and this is
really really creamy oh my gosh so this
might be one that I'm like I would just
put on my lids and just leave like
that'll be all I need you know what I
mean this is really exciting to me I
love cream shadows so much okay so that
is awesome
another thing is Oh a lip gloss this is
in the shade pearl necklace I've never
gotten any of their lip product so I'm
actually really really excited look at
the color it's like a mile of pearl
color okay so it's got just a doe foot
applicator Oh what wouldn't I just drop
oh it's just the wrapper or whatever oh
you can't see it so it's just uh it's a
translucent pearl color you're not going
to see it I should you know what I don't
want to like dip the brush in it but I
might like oh this is really nice
I'm doing the sticky test okay it
doesn't feel sticky which is great and
it just feels nice it almost feels like
moisturizing but I'll have to wear it
for longer than like two seconds to be
able to let you know but I really I like
the way that it feels so far so and I
like the way it looks I mean it's just a
nice glossy overcoat to any color so
that's nice by the way if you're
wondering what I'm wearing on my lips
right now is the Rimmel apocalypse and
nova really it's just a nice pink
alright and the last thing in the Box is
what is this a or the lipstick
yes it's in the shade Pusey or puzzie
it's PU zzy like fuzzy but with the P
but it's there tender gloss lipstick I
like the packaging it reminds me of the
matte cream
Chane packaging it's like that heavier
metal you know what I mean so it feels
really nice oh this is like a peach like
a shear toned peachy kind of color it's
a lot of courses not coming across it
really it is pretty sheer but it's it's
nice I know this makes me think of
summer and like juicy peachy type colors
and getting some color on your skin and
oh that makes me excited that might be a
favorite this summer actually cuz it's
nice and you don't need a mirror with it
and none of these have a smell which is
also nice because you know some lip
products have I think of the NYX lip
glosses that smell like cherries or the
Milani lipsticks that smell like
watermelon I love both of those products
very much but the smells kind of drive
me nuts so neither one of these have a
smells so you know what this might be my
favorite Starbucks I've gotten because I
these are all useful colors to me you
know me I don't wear that many bright
colors that often so I'm actually really
really really excited about this and it
also came with the oh it's got some
forty forty percent off coupon code
