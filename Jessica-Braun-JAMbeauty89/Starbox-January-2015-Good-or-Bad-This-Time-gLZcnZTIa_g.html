just gonna quickly unbox my star box for
this month which is January 2015
this box is $15 a month they send it to
me for free to show you guys know it's
not sponsored they don't pay me to show
it I don't have to show it if I don't
want to but I'm choosing to show up to
you every month so I'm excited to see
what's in here these boxes for me seem
to be kind of hit or miss because
sometimes it's amazing and there's a lot
of good very useful products but other
times they'll send colors and products
that I'm like I'm never gonna use this
like it's so wild or like like I
wouldn't have a problem if one problem
was like a wild color but then the rest
of the products were you know more
useful but sometimes they'll send like
three or four products and all of them
are crazy colors so I'm excited to see
if this is a useful lately they've been
so much better so I feel like hopefully
it will be just as good as it has been
so let's go ahead and dig right yeah
okay so it doesn't say ooh
it says marsala okay so there's
something marsala in here and I'm
already excited so let's dig right in
the first thing I'm seeing is this big
oh it's brush shampoo this is the Malibu
soap works brush shampoo and when I look
inside it's basically like a hardened
you know soap and I they have like the
Beauty Blender they have the Beauty
Blender solid soap that comes in a
similar package and you just kind of you
know you get your brush whatever and
then you just swirl it in here to get
the suds and get the soap into the brush
so that's pretty cool i'm i'm sure i
will use this this is great for
traveling if you know you're gonna be
gone a while and that you might actually
need to clean your brushes this is
easier to travel with in a liquid of
course although in a pinch you could
really use any kind of soap maybe it
won't be the best for your brushes but
in a pinch I mean this would take up
some room anyway I'm rambling so that's
pretty cool I've never seen anything
from another brand in this box it's
always star look so it's kind of
interesting but it says it's coconut
let's see it just smells like soap it
doesn't like coconut but either way
useful awesome and different okay the
next thing ooh is this
looks brush its says I contour like with
the letter I 853 and it looks like it's
just this brush that's certainly useful
for the crease I would use this like
crazy the next thing in here is an
eyeliner it's their coleye pencil so
this is in the shade chestnut which is
like a deep brown a very deep brown but
if the pencils really soft so you can
see when I did the swatch it really took
a lot out of the actual liner so I mean
it's really really creamy and soft which
is great but that means it's gonna be
it'll go away quickly
like it'll I'll use it up a lot quicker
than a normal liner but that is also
useful the last thing in here is what I
think must be the marsala thing and it's
a lipstick in yes it's in the shade
marsala this is awesome if you don't
know I'm sure most of you do the color
of the year from the Pantone color
whatever is marsala which is this well
I'll show you it's this color here oh my
gosh this is so pretty it's just this
gorgeous oh my gosh
kind of like a rosy color and this is
really really creamy doesn't really have
a smell at all their packaging seems to
get a little bit better each time I get
a lip product so this is awesome I am
really really excited I will certainly
use this oh my gosh that color is so
pretty I'm so excited so that was
everything that came in it all at all I
mean this was worth the $15 because the
liner in the lipstick alone are in the
okay everything in here was incredibly
useful like I actually am going to
incorporate these I feel like a lot of
times like one or two the items I'll
actually keep and use and the rest
either get put in a drawer and then I
eventually get rid of because I never
used them or whatever so this is awesome
they keep getting better and better and
really excited so hopefully that unbox
thing was fun to watch if you enjoyed it

subscription box unboxings I have a
whole playlist I can link below I know
