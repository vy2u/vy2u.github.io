unboxing of the star looks star box now
this is a company it is $15 a month and
you get I think three to four products
from their brand and their brand it's
really really good quality makeup and I
don't think I've any I've ever received
anything from them that I thought was
low-quality you know what I mean and
it's kind of tricky because this is a
brand that most people haven't heard of
so it's one of those things or you're
like I don't know if I want to spend $15
a month I've never heard of this brand
I've never tried anything but I had
tried some other stuff from I think past
hypsi bags and I really liked it so when
I found out they had a box I was really
excited when they said that they would
let me review these for them so let's go
ahead and dig in
and I actually have not opened this I
know a lot of my unboxings I've already
like open and use some of the things but
this one I actually have not opened
because I just got it so it's there
February Starbucks and it says at the
top that the retail value of everything
is $41 so you're paying $15 and you're
gonna get forty-one dollars worth of
stuff so alright hmm it looks like
there's three full-size products and
then this like extra little thing so
let's just start with the extra thing
what is this it's a surprise
oh it still holds your hair back while
you're doing your makeup which actually
I do use a thing like this you go ahead
and open it and see kind of what it's
like I actually do use a thing like this
when I do my makeup so that's kind of
nice
and I like to wash it like in the washer
when I'm washing clothes so it'll be
nice to kinda have a backup and this one
actually might be better than the one I
have hidden matches my hair - Wow almost
perfectly so that's a nice little extra
something that is useful to me for sure
okay so into the makeup let's start with
this this is a lipstick in the shade BFF
see so they always have really pretty
nice packaging like it's like heavier if
you know what I mean so looks like this
might be the shade which seems pretty
nude to me
yeah it's a really really neutral color
oh my gosh like almost way too nude you
guys see that hmm let me see
cuz I'm wondering if this is supposed to
be like to put over darker ones because
this alone would be so nude on me it
would look crazy it says it's super
moisturizing a long-lasting it did feel
really creamy the color you received can
stand alone as its own shade which for
my skintone it might work for darker
skin tones it actually might look nice
or to me pay off can be paired with a
bold lip color to give it an extra
metallic boost or can be used as a
highlighter to create the perfect ombre
lip okay well that makes sense to me so
that's probably how I would have to use
it I think alone on me it just it almost
looks like a really pretty eye shade you
know what I mean but anyway but that's
nice and their lipsticks I mean that
feels really nice alright moving on so
this looks like is this it's a pigment
and it's in the shade tungsten hmmm so
I'm betting it's some sort of metal kind
of shade it looks like it's like a yeah
like a steel gray color can I open it
I'm like a little nervous okay so it's
got a little opening like that at the
top I'll just hear it here's what we'll
do perfect so I got a little bit on my
finger here you guys see that looks
pretty let me do another little bit of
it oh yeah it's more like a greyish
steel it's a really pretty color it's
not a color that I would wear all the
time I don't think but it's nice and I
think a lot of people would wear a color
like this that's for sure and it feels
nice and what it looks like is that
they've started having a few different
options so like for example on this it
said you either got tungsten or Wall
Street someone so other people got other
shades same with the lipstick I think
there were three different shades that
were sent out so but that's nice and
then the last thing in here is this what
is oh it's a cream shadow yes I love
cream shadows okay I don't know if I has
a shade right on it or if it's on that
let's see I can get it out of here okay
okay it's in the shade called core and
again just really simple it looks like
it's this like dark gold oh my gosh look
at it it's like a burnt gold color I
really like that I'm so excited to use
this as a shadow base oh my gosh it
feels really really creamy like crazy
creamy trying to think of what it
reminds me of I can't think of what it
reminds me of it's certainly creamier
than like the Maybelline Color tattoos
cuz those those are creamy ish but you
know how they can kind of get like thick
in a way this is like milk I mean that
doesn't make sense but you know what I
mean so those are the things so for $15
you got a pigment cream shadow which I
really like a lipstick and you got this
little extra it's not too bad I think
past boxes I've gotten from them have
been much better my favourite box still
is the one where they sent a whole
pallet for that month and it is one of
my favorite palettes I've ever I shadow
palettes that is that I've ever I use it
all the time oh my gosh all the time so
they but there are always goodies and I
don't think I've ever been completely
disappointed in a box like I am
sometimes like with Birchbox so if
you're looking to try a new box or to
try some higher-end makeup this is a
great starting place because it's $15
and you can you know cancel it at any
time you could just get one month and
see how you like it
and just kind of get a feel for some
nicer quality makeup then I don't want
to say then the drugstore because
there's a lot of you guys know I love
the drugstore and there are some amazing
products in the drugstore but still so
if you wanted to try it in from brand I
think this is a good one and so yeah I
hope this was helpful and I'll catch you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
