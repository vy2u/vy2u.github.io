doing an unboxing this is a brand new
box to me this is called stitch fix this
video is not sponsored by Stitch fiction
I just paid for this box on my own
because I really genuinely wanted to try
this my sister is actually the one that
got me into it and basically what it is
is it's a clothing and fashion box so it
could be purses shoes you do like a
style profile kind of quiz type thing
where you say yes I would like that I
like these outfits I don't like these I
kind of like these things like that but
then you um get assigned to stylist and
you basically tell them okay like what
kinds of things do you need right now do
you need a pair of black flats you need
some tops for work do you need some
summer clothing whatever and you can
also tell them what you definitely do
not need like for example I've got tons
of dresses so I said no dresses I don't
need any dresses things like that so I
had said I wanted some spring clothing I
told them that I you know I'm a youtuber
but I'm also a teacher so I'd like it to
be able to work for both of those jobs
and everything that was sent to me was
so cute so you get five different items
and the price ranges depending on what
the piece is so you once you get your
box you do pay a $20 styling fee which
can be applied to towards items in your
box you want to keep so for example if
there were only one item in my box I
wanted to keep and it was $40 the $20 I
paid that month for the stylist to pick
the items will go towards that so I'd be
getting the shirt for 20 dollars instead
of 40 even though really I'm paying 40
you guys see what I'm saying
so what I like is you don't have to keep
anything if you don't want however the
one caveat is sorry my dog explains this
way the one caveat is that you lose that
$20 at 7 fee if you don't at least buy
one thing so that's kind of how they get
you there but um everything was really
cute this month and I haven't decided if
I'm going to keep everything but I'm
almost positive I am there are certain
pieces I know for sure I'm keeping and
just gonna buy but what's nice is it
comes with let me find it in here a bag
that you send back to them and it's free
so it's a really big bag and in that you
can put everything you don't want and if
it's all of it then that's all of it and
you don't have to pay for shipping or
anything which is really nice so then
you don't feel like traps
I don't feel like sending it back they
make it really easy thank you for that
so let's go ahead and get started the
first thing I saw in here and of course
I've already like torn into this tried
it all on but when they first arrived
I'll show you a picture right here um it
was so adorably like folded and
presented it was so cute so what's nice
is you actually get a note from your
stylist and it you can tell it's
actually specifically for you because
she mentions very specific things I said
um and it goes through and it shows you
what's in your box and how you could
style it and I love that because I mean
it's like Pinterest unit that's why a
lot of us love it you can see a lot of
outfits and how their style so the first
thing in here I was really excited about
it's this yellow flowy tank top and it's
by the brand Pixley sorry I have a
swatch from another video wait I can't
get it off it's a color tattoo and I
can't get it off anyway um I love this I
thought oh my gosh it makes me think of
like lemons and it's so springy and it'd
be cute on its own but it would also be
cute with like a blazer I have a navy
blue blazer that I've gotten mine in my
closet that I know I would love to wear
this with so this was like I literally
saw this first and I was like yes that's
exactly my style and I realized I love
tops like this that are flowy they're
comfortable I mean it's kind of like
what I'm wearing today um and a lot of
them have this cute seen on the back
right there that I just think is cute
this one that I'm wearing does as well
so this one I know that I'm keeping the
next thing in here that I was like oh my
gosh was these mint green skinny jeans
oh my gosh they fit like a glove like a
glove and they feel really well made the
brand is called just black and it says
it was designed exclusively for stitch
fix so that's pretty cool um I I just
love them these are the kind of thing
pants like this are so amazing in your
wardrobe because you can wear them with
so many different things you can wear
them as pattern tops you can wear them
with really neutral tops they're at
their great adding a pop of color and
they're comfortable and they can be with
sandals with heels with boots I mean
there's so much you can do with them I
love it so again that's the definite
thing that I'm
to keep the next thing and this is one
that I'm pretty sure I'm going to keep
is a top that's really similar to that
yellow one it's navy blue but it has
these scalloped sleeves that are so cute
and it also has on the back this little
peekaboo little slit with a button and I
just thought oh my gosh this is so cute
it makes me think of like kind of like
Peter Pan in a way and navy blue is one
my favorite colors because again you
compare it with so many different things
like this I think would look cute I have
a pink blazer that I think would look
really cute over this but um it's kind
of more one of those things like okay
budget wise what can I afford to keep
him what can I not so I need to think
about that with these next thing in here
is a blazer now this is one I'm pretty
sure I'm going to send back it's a
really I like the color it's kind of
like a tangerine it might come across as
different in on the camera versus in
person but it's more like a red orange
and I love the lining on the inside but
it just just kind of flimsy like it's
really thick up here and then it's
flimsy here which I don't mind but you
know I want to be able to roll this up
to expose this but it like does the
linings like slips from it and it
doesn't stay and I don't know something
about it I'm just like you know this
isn't the right fit for me like
literally it's it's just not exactly
what I wanted and for the price I think
this is like $90 I was like no I will
say that 90 for like next month's box
when I want to keep something else that
I truly love the next thing it was these
shoes and it actually came in this cute
little canvas bag that says stitch fix
which i think is cute and I'm again this
is like the same color as the Blazer
look at these colors together aren't
they so pretty
um these shoes are by the brand say
shells or Seychelles
I never say shell so no and there are
these sandals and they kind of look like
flats from the back but they are more
sandal like in the front and they are so
cute I tried them on thinking oh they're
probably not going to be comfortable I
like a little bit wider feet they are so
comfortable I was shocked so this is the
thing that I am pretty sure I'm going to
keep these as well so the one I know I'm
going to return is the Blazer the navy
blue shirt I'm thinking about but I do
really like it and it fits me well too
but I'm deaf
about the mint-green pants and the
yellow top and these I'm pretty sure man
keep as well so um you have a couple
days after you get your box to let them
know online like here's what I'm gonna
keep here's what I'm going to return and
you can even tell them why so like for
the blazer I might say you know I really
don't like the fit of that blazer I'd
want something a little more fitted or
whatever which i think is great because
then the next time you get a box if you
decide to get one then you can they'll
have a better idea of what you like
another thing that I didn't do but I
think I'm gonna do before next month's
box ships to me is they said you can
share what your Pinterest board you can
create one called stitch fix and share
it with them and then you can just pin a
ton of out but you like and they can
look for items like that stuff like that
which I thought that is actually really
cool and that'd be a great way to get
them um you know really honed in on what
I like
another thing I've already sent them a
message for my next one and told them
like I know that I need a pair of black
flats the ones I have are getting really
old and I know I need some kind of dark
black cardigan cuz though I just got rid
of the one I had it was really kind of
ratty and I wear a black cardigan all
the times kind of a nice surprise each
month what you'll get um it's like
having a personal shopper cut it it's
kind of just weird I don't know if I'll
do this forever I'm gonna do it again
for another month and just see so if
you'd be interested in me showing you
guys what's in my next month's box I
definitely can just let me know down
below this is one of those boxes where
you there's no commitment at all you
don't even have to cancel you schedule
when you want your next pick so it's not
like you pay once and you're already
roped in for the next month you schedule
at each time so if you don't want one
you just don't schedule one and that's
that and that's one reason I know my
sister really liked it so hopefully this
was enjoyable for you guys if you're
interested in more of my subscription
box unboxings I will link my entire
playlist of those below so other than
that I hope you enjoyed and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
