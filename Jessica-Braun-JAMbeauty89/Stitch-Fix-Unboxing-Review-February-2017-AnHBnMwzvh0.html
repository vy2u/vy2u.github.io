sharing with you guys a stitch fix
unboxing
I've already unboxed it and I've already
worn a hostess I love this box so much
if you have never heard of it it is a
clothing fashion subscription box this
is not sponsored or anything like that
I love stitch fix I buy it with my own
money I mean it's one of those
subscription boxes that you know what my
makeup subscription boxes I love but I
get a little not tired of that's the
wrong way to put it but I've got a lot
of makeup but clothing wise I feel like
there's always room to grow and there's
always new stuff there is - and makeup I
think you guys get what I'm saying I
wanted to share it with you guys a
couple like things you need to know if
you're thinking about doing stitch fix
you pay a $20 styling fee but that $20
can be applied to what you buy in the
box what I love is you can get the boxes
you hate it all send it all back and I
don't think I've done that yet there's
always at least something but there's
usually like two or three things out of
the five items they send you that I love
this time there were five items and I
loved all five so you can also what I
think is really neat and the reason I
like situates more than some other
subscriptions is you can choose how not
how much you want to spend but kind of
the level so like you don't want to
spend very much you're willing to
splurge a little or like really really
high you know expensive stuff so I think
that's really nice because it kind of
gives you some wiggle room and so you
can tell your stylist
you know you sign up and they just kind
of assign you to someone and you can
tell them like hey I'm a teacher this is
my job I need clothes for worker I need
clothes for on a stay-at-home mom I want
some cute stuff for date night but I
also want some comfy stuff for home what
I told them this time I was very general
I just said I just want five new trendy
cool pieces that's what I want no rules
you know whatever I think I said I
didn't want any shoes or purses I have
my referral links below if you want to
go through that of course with referral
links I get a little bit of a kickback
from it if you're not comfortable with
that I will also link just a regular
website you don't have to feel pressured
and clicking my link it's not that free
with you okay so let's go ahead and
unbox so the first thing before I hope
with the box is what I'm wearing I told
you I've been wearing
put all this back in the box this
turtleneck so it just is cozy like kind
of looser it's a little bit longer I'm
wearing it was actually like if you can
see it like red leggings I just bought
these red leggings like literally at a
grocery store they were like $5 and I
was like perfect but it's the comfiest
like lusus cowl neck kind of a hybrid
turtleneck kind of thing it's so
comfortable it doesn't it's worn but it
doesn't make me feel like hot like some
other turtle X I own because I have one
very similar to this that I love that I
wore recently in videos but I feel like
this one is a lot more comfortable if so
you know they send you a USPS bag that's
really really big as you can fold it
that you can send everything it back in
or like say you're buying two of the
items and sending three back you can
come all in there it's already stamped
you don't have to pay postage you just
drop it all to the post office all right
next thing okay this one was really
exciting to me there were this last
night when we were having people over
it's this gold bracelet and I feel like
I never buy jewelry I don't know like
ten degrees in a very long time since
I've gone to a jewelry section and
thought oh yeah I wanna get some new
pieces like they never buy jewelry so
this was really exciting to me and it's
a cuff but you can totally resize it and
for me like you know everyone has
different size wrists so I feel like
like this is too big on me in my opinion
but I can just squeeze it and it
actually holds the shape I feel like a
lot of ones that I have like I'll
squeeze it and it doesn't really change
but this one stays in place I think it
is so cute and fun and I'm I just love
it and if something what I like about
this is these are pieces that I don't
think if I saw them in a store I would
have been like boo but because they were
sent to me and I was kind of in a way
forced to try it on I'm like oh actually
I do like that so it's a great way to
just kind of freshen your wardrobe I
feel like it should mine just so stale
the next piece is this it's literally
inside out because I wore it last night
it's this floral polyester shirt and
it's loose-fitting which I like because
I can wear it to work but I loved it was
kind of a floral that I haven't really
seen anywhere yet it was this nice navy
blue with different splashes of teal and
orange and
and green it has buttons and pockets on
the front all insert a picture of me
wearing this I just literally took it my
mirror but I just love this shirt it was
so comfortable wearing it last night it
can you can dress it up like you could
put a blazer just wear it alone dress up
or you can just put it with jeans and
wear it just on a normal you know
weekend date what I also like is this
next piece this is a quilted grey bomber
jacket
I love bomber jackets because they're so
comfortable you can throw them on
anything and it instantly makes it look
just a little bit edgier without really
being too edgy at all but this one is so
cute again all in certain image of me
wearing it over the floral shirt it's
just it's really comfortable it's not
super fitted but it's not super baggy
either it's kind of right in between and
again I can be really picky about that
but I really liked the fit of this
bomber jacket it just it's got little
pockets it's just comfortable again it's
actually really really warm and so I
just fell in love definitely time that
the next pair of jeans I kind of went
back and forth with I thought about
sending them back but I like the fit of
them so well and I need new jeans that I
decided to keep them but these are the
kind of medium toned denim jeans and you
know the back pockets are very normal
but they have some distressing on the
knee like real bits of like holes and
stuff but it's not too much so I don't
mind that but the thing that made me
think I'm not sure are the bottom so the
bottoms when you wear them they're
afraid on purpose and the front half
like where it would be around your the
front part of your leg is a little bit
higher than the back part so it's kind
of one of those things are look I don't
know how I feel about it but I wore them
yesterday with the floral shirt I was
like you know what I actually kind of
liked them because it adds something a
little bit edgier and a little bit
different but I mean at first glance it
just looks like jeans it's a little bit
of distressing so I thought its I that's
fine just like I I think it's just time
for me to be a little bit more brave
with that kind of stuff so I'm I am
going to keep these in these feel they
fit amazingly so that was very exciting
so they give you the prices of all this
stuff I chose the I don't remember the
option I think I chose the like medium
level or maybe like I don't mind
spending a little
more on clothing just cuz I wanted to
see what they would spend so the jeans
were 58 dollars but for me I'm like you
know what if they're nice jeans that I
like that's worth it and these fits so
comfortably and I could totally put them
in boots as well and they still look
really really cute and comfortable and I
needed them so for me it's worth it when
they're really nice the bomber jacket
and I'm going to wear to death
this one was $78 so it is much much
pricier but again I chose a little bit
pricier of a plan the floral shirt was
let's see hmm $54 I feel like this is
the kind of shirt you probably could
find for cheaper but again since I chose
that pricier option and I just love that
shirt heat cuff that I love was $32
which I thought like I thought about not
keeping like is so much money but there
was like you know what Jeff truth treat
yo self and I really really loved this
cuff and I've never seen anything like
it so I was like I'm doing it for me I'm
doing it oh I'm looking for the fifth
item I'm wearing it
so this cowl-neck pullover with 78
dollars but when I put it on I'm like it
is it is worth $78 so I'm I was just
very excited to treat myself with Tyrone
because usually I only keep like one or
two items so the other kicker is so once
it's top total with $300 and then a I'm
looking at they send you like a little
statement so the subtotal for all five
items is $300 but if you buy all five
they're smart you're so smart because if
you buy five you get 25% off and so I
would get $75 off and then the $20 like
styling fee that you pay is also taken
off so in the end and says $300 I'd be
paying 185 dollars so if you think about
that I mean it's a little bit cheaper
but if you don't buy like one item it's
not 25% off it definitely behooves you
to buy all five items if you like them
enough and if you can afford it because
you do save I mean a ton of money but it
just kind of depends on if you actually
like them or not because like I said
this might be the first time I've kept
all five items I think maybe one other
time anyway like I said I'll have my
link below as well as the regular link
if you are interested in this I love it
I think you will too I stopped getting
it for a few months over the holidays
because I was like I need to focus on
gifts for people and stuff but I think
I'm going to get back into the habit of
buying it more often and sharing it with
you guys because I know a lot of you
guys like seeing this other than that I
hope that you'll subscribe to catch more
of my videos I can link my past stitch
fix unboxings if your cheers to see more
and get an idea of other items you might
get and I hope to see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
