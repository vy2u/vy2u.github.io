an unboxing of my ditched fix for this
month and I actually have a giveaway
ditch fix was kind enough to reach out
and ask if I'd be willing to do a
giveaway on my channel in like yeah yeah
so they're not paying me to do this
video but they are offering you guys a
giveaway so I thought that was awesome
since I already do these unboxings on my
channel every so often so all of the
info for how to enter the giveaway will
be down below if you don't know what the
trick is it's a fashion and accessory
subscription box you pay $20 for like a
styling fee and you can apply it at $20
toward whatever you buy in your box
you don't have to buy anything however
if you don't buy like at least one items
you do lose the $20 so it's kind of like
this so it definitely behooves you to at
least buy one item as I told you guys in
my past videos but you can let them know
what kinds of things you're needing in
your wardrobe right now what kind of job
you have the size as you are and you can
also what I've done the past few times
is I have a Pinterest board and I linked
that to my account so they can see it
and they see all the things I'm pinning
in on that stitch fix board that I
created so that gives them an idea of my
style and maybe pieces I would like in
my next box so that part that I think is
really what sets it apart makes it
really cool so you can keep all of your
items and you do get like a 20% off I
think discount 25% off discount you buy
all five well you could just buy one you
could buy two by three by none of them
they give you a bag that arty has posted
on it so you don't have to pay postage
and you can send it all back in that bag
so it really is one of those they do
make it easy for you if you don't like
something they don't make it difficult
to send it back and I really appreciate
that you also decide what price range
you want you can pick the lowest price
range or the highest etc but I'm really
excited I linked to my Pinterest board
and let them go to town and so I'm
really excited to see what is in this
book let's dig in so the first thing
right on top I'm seeing are the oh I
like reading hold on there no they
usually leave like a know why they
included what they included she says
that since spring is finally sprung I
know you like to dress from desk to
dinner I've got two complete outfits for
you yes I know you will slay in
sweet alright so the first thing in here
is this navy blue skirt so it's a pencil
skirt that is so cute it's got this
little very slight pattern on it like a
little texture that I think really is
pretty and makes it not just super basic
this would look so pretty with like a
white button-down tucked into it don't
you guys think with like a bright
colored shoe so that is really cute and
now that it's warming up I can actually
wear skirts to teach hints the next item
is this cute blouse so it's it from
Alice blue and I've gotten a couple
things from this Alice blue brand and I
love like everything but it's a really
slowly tank top that be so pretty
actually this would be cute with this
skirt wouldn't it but I feel like you
can wear it with white jeans you can
wear it with gosh a lot of different
stuff but I love that it has this navy
blue tie there I think that's really
pretty and it's so springy and next
thing ooh is a blazer from the brand
Kenzi and it's like this
gosh like a really pretty coral but it
has almost that like tweed look to it is
that the word I'm looking for but it
does have like little shoulder pads I
love how it's rolled up a little bit
here
it's so cute so that okay so thinking
about that ideas I think this is meant
to be together
that's really really cute together so
the next item in here ours oh my gosh
I've never owned pants this color the
brand is just black and it's these kind
of blueish teal tinny pants skinny jeans
because they are kind of Jean but
they're elastic love that but it's got a
real button in zipper which I also love
real pockets this is such a pretty color
so are the shoes - okay the fifth item
joy confide items are and then with them
in like a nice bag these shoes oh my
gosh are so cute I love the color
honestly - all of this goes together but
I love that they pointed tell that it's
got little laser cut out holes is that
laser cut out I don't know they look
like they'd actually be comfortable also
it wise I could wear these skinny jeans
with the cute floral blouse
with the coral flats and then I should
put on the blazer if I need it I could
also do that same outfit but instead of
the jeans do it with these skirts so I
love that these were more curated like
outfit wise you don't have to get outfit
but they always give you those kind of
suggestions of how you can pair them
together what you could wear it to and I
just think that's so cute and it makes
me feel like way cooler than I actually
am do you know what I mean like I don't
know how else to describe that but it
makes me feel cooler that I am to be
like yes yes this outfit was curated and
it's actually styled for me because I
can't really say that about like
anything else in my life so as I
mentioned I love the tricks I've been
doing this for has it been a year you
can have a full year I'll link my all of
my past did chick videos below if you're
interested I think for this I always
tell you guys what I'm going to keep of
what I'm not I might keep it all I've
there have been some times where I've
kept absolutely everything there have
been other times that I've only kept
like one or two things so I really you
know I love that you can return it and
not feel like you've lost a ton of money
