gonna do an unboxing of my latest stitch
fix box and if you haven't seen any of
my previous stitch fix unboxings I will
link them below because I've done I mean
it varies month to month depending on
what I've asked for if you don't know
what such fix is in a nutshell it is a
clothing and accessories subscription
service they send you five items you
pick what you want to keep you send back
what you don't you decide how often you
want it so you might only get it once
every few months
so you schedule when you want your
stitch fixed but the biggest caveat is
that you have to pay a $20 styling fee
for the stylist to read your requests go
through pick out the items and send them
so if you don't buy any of the items in
your box then you still lose that $20 so
it kind of behooves you to buy at least
one item I'm excited to show you these I
actually have already sent back two of
them so I have pictures to show you
but it was kind of I was traveling at
the same time so I kind of had to send
them back so they didn't charge me for
them so I have pictures of them however
but I'm keeping three of them one of
them let's go ahead and start is the one
I'm wearing today so I'll show you in a
picture so you can see it full on this
is just a really cute white
short-sleeved kind of like almost like
macrame shirt with a little black detail
I thought it was so cute and I think I
could totally wear it to work I think
and it's just cute you could wear it
like I'm wearing it today with like this
little choker type necklace you can wear
it with whatever you want and I thought
this could look dressed up it could look
dressed down you could do a lot with it
so this is one I definitely kept I'll
have prices of all these below they sent
me two of the same I had asked for five
different short sleeve shirts so usually
I'll get like some pants and shirts and
pair of shoes but this time I
specifically said for work I need short
sleeve shirts just like a various amount
so the next item they had sent was this
navy blue kind of tank top is short
sleeved tight shirt and it it was okay
it was wasn't very flattering on me it
was kind of boxy and it was nice and
flowy which I do like but it was just a
little bit too big and I thought you
know for the price I didn't really need
another navy blue shirt right now so
that was one I was willing to send back
but kind of in the same family that navy
blue this one was just like a cotton but
I loved the pattern and the colors on it
and look at the cute detail on the back
it has this adorable like lace open it's
not really open though and that's why
it's perfect for work it has this lace
overlay in the middle but it's still
covered because the pattern cut the
pattern fabric is right behind it as
well I thought this was so cute again it
was a little bit loose but not too loose
and just was comfortable and that's
exactly what I was hoping for so this is
one that I absolutely loved definitely
kept it's clearly already on a hanger
the next one was from the same brand as
that navy blue one so it was around the
same price and it had this kind of
bluish orange Paisley type pattern to it
and it was the same fit so I already
didn't really like the fit in the cut of
it but I also hated hated the pattern
and I know some people love that pattern
actually I think my husband loves
Paisley I hate it so for me I was like
no that was that was like the first one
I saw on was like that's definitely
going back so the last item was that
probably my favorite maybe next to this
one it's just this beautiful ivory color
just polyester shirt but what I loved
about it is this cute like tulip blossom
sleeve it's so cute I kind of want one
in like pink too and I'm almost positive
that like all lists the exact names of
these below I don't know if I've done it
in past videos but I'll do it for this
one I'm almost positive
you can request specific items from them
and I don't mean just from anywhere but
since these are for sure in their stitch
fix closet if you will you could request
that specific item when you write your
note to your stylist and I'm if it's in
stock in your size I'm sure they would
send it to you which i think is great
because obviously if you know what you
want then why not and this is one I
would highly recommend it feels really
well-made it's really comfortable of
course I have to wear like a camisole
under it because it is it's not sheer
but its sheer enough well I guess it is
kind of sheer that you would definitely
need something under but I love it it's
so beautiful for work and I love finding
great white or ivory shirts cuz they go
with everything I mean you could
literally wear it with any
and I oh I just love it so and I feel
like white is so flattering on everyone
so I'm just really excited about it I
know it was a pretty quick video if
you're kind of in the mood for unboxings
I have an entire playlist of unboxings
on my channel I will link the playlist
below you Cashmore not just stitch fix
but tons of like food unboxings and
makeup subscription unboxings things
like that other than that I hope you'll
subscribe to catch more of my videos and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
