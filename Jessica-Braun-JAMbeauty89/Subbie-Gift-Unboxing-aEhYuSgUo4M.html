have a very exciting video so I for the
very first time in my life met one of my
subscribers and um her name is Amy and

her and it was the most surreal and cool
cool cool feeling and I mean I've met
friends of mine that are also
subscribers but this is the first
subscriber I've ever met that I didn't
know before I started doing this you
know what I mean and it was so cool Amy

to the show and it was just so cool to
finally put a face to a name that I've
seen comment on my videos you know um

had brought me a little gift bag so I
figured I'd open this here so one of the
things that wasn't like raft was this
little Minnie Mouse she's gone and if

that I am a total Disney nut and so this
was really cool to get and I actually
