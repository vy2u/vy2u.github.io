going to share with you guys an unboxing
of three different subscription boxes
I've got epsy boxycharm and this time I
also have birch box I haven't subscribed
to birch box in a while but I decided
this month to Reese absque Ribe just
because I was like you know I feel like
I've been doing it see for a long time
and birch box is the same price and a
lot of people love it and love seeing
that so also I spoke coffee on the
boxycharm that is my life today I feel
like that's thinking alright so let's
start with the birch box because I am so
excited then we'll move on from there so
birch box is $10 a month this was the
box this is these are all from August
I'm a little behind this month but this
is the birch box and it's just this cute
box let's see what's in it so it says
it's time to eke out every last bit of
summer and for that you'll need products
that don't slow you down so in it ooh
first thing oh this is expensive this is
from or BAE it's there après beach wave
and shine spray there are products are
really expensive and I've tried their
dry shampoo no I've tried their dry
texturizing spray and that's amazing but
it's stupid expensive but it really is
nice I just kind of I don't want to like
waste any but I also don't want to oh
okay smells really good all of their
products smell really really nice it
says you can spray it on wet or dry hair
so go figure next thing in here speaking
of hair is this Beauty protector protect
and detangle leave-in conditioner and it
says it's a UV protector it seals the
cuticle to lose your hair locks in color
adds shine weightless I mean there's a
million things from what I remember I'm
not gonna spray this one but I do want
to smell they I have their Beauty
protector like oil and it smelled like
cotton candy it smelled amazing yes this
one smells that same scent it's very
very very sweet but I love it but if you
don't like sweet smells you might not
like it but I'm excited to give this a
try again it's that perfect travel size
next thing in here I'm currently opening
is from manna kadar and I remember
loving manna kadar had this like I mean
I'm sure they still have it I just have
used it up it was like a lot or a lash
primer and it was unbelievable it was so
amazing I need to buy it again but
anyway this is a little eyeshadow duo oh
I'm sorry
it's a bronzer and
read it Jessica here's the thing right
off the bat they're really pigmented
which is awesome really really pigmented
but they first of all you totally could
use these as eyeshadows but I don't like
that the pan is so small that it's gonna
be really tricky to get your brush just
in that side of it so I would almost
rather just get the bronzer or just get
the highlighter so that I can dip my
brush in it and not worry about getting
the other product on my brush so that's
one thing I'll say right off the bat I
never really understand why they do
duo's for bronzers and highlighters like
that but really really pretty really in
the end what I could do is just kind of
swirl my brush in all of it and just
kind of get a bronzy glowy blush type
look with it so that's something that's
the way I might use that because it is
really pigmented the next thing in here
is this the organic pharmacy enzyme peel
mask with vitamin C and papaya powerful
gel mask to renew dull skin improve
elasticity and even your skin tone
and it says it has a 71.4% organic
content this is one I'll definitely use
this might only be a couple uses but
Tyler my husband will usually do things
like this with me just for fun and it's
good for her skin too of course so I
will definitely try that probably this
week and then another face I have this
this is the Marcel Hydra C 24-hour
energizing hydrating gel oh no I just
have a similar so I have the Marcel
Hydra C like exfoliating scrub and it is
amazing I love it so much in the reviews
of that are amazing like on Paula's
Choice as well which is why I bought it
it's kind of pricey though but it's
lasted me forever because I don't use
that it's like a physical exfoliator I
don't use that kind of exfoliation any
more than like once maybe twice a week
but usually just once so this is
actually a hydrating gel that you leave
on so I will definitely give that a try
so all in all certainly and make sure we
had two skincare items a makeup item and
two hair items again I kind of like that
it's a mix because at least for me I've
got tons of makeup so I like that I'm
getting a little bit of everything
awesome
I'm glad I researched crabbed I mean I'm
curious to see what's in this at ten
and as we get into fall like October I'm
always so excited for subscription boxes
so the Ipsy this month is a really
well-made back I always talk about how
they I feel like they switch back and
forth like one month it's kind of and
then the next month the bag is nicer
it's like they just switch back and
forth but it's got like it looks like
kind of a mermaid type character on
there it's pretty and I love the light
pink a zipper so going in
what's the dive in there's a full size
something this is the it haircare 12 in
one amazing leave-in treatment I've had
this before a long time ago and I liked
it but I remember I passed it on just
because I had tons of hair stuff I
passed on to my mom and she loved it so
honestly I'm probably gonna pass on her
just because I know she was on the
lookout to buy a new one so that's
actually pretty cool but it's got all
these benefits like you know helps your
ends in it kind of like the same as that
beauty protector thing I read sookie
sookie hair protects your color repairs
dry damaged hair protects split ends etc
so that is awesome and I love that it's
a full sized that alone is almost worth
the $10 I don't know how much it costs
at the store this is the this works
modern natural beauty in transit camera
close-up it's a mask moisturizer and
primer and one apply to clean skin and
massage until absorbed so this is
actually a really cool idea because I
like the Too Faced hangover RX primer
because it is like a moisturizing primer
I feel like I'm putting on a moisturizer
but it's also working as my primer and
that's why I love it but it's really
expensive and so when I think about like
okay I'm starting to run out do I really
want to buy it again I don't know if I
want to just because it's pricey so I
don't know how much this is and if she
never really says the prices but I'm
excited to try this so I'm probably
gonna break this baby out this week and
give it a try because I love the idea of
that for me I've got normal to dry skin
so that's exactly what I need in a
primer next thing
oh is this Tarte product it's the tarte
lipsurgence lip cream in the shade
wonder and it's one of their smaller
sizes but these are expensive this is
such a pretty color just kind of a red
with a little bit of a pink tint to it
these smell like mints if you like these
kinds always feel like
these are the products I end up getting
rid of like the pencil type you know
like chubby pencils just because I never
find myself reaching for them in my
collections so I've made myself stop
buying them at the store because I never
and I'll use them for maybe the week I
buy it and then I never reach for him
again because I would rather just have a
lip gloss or lipstick and call it a day
so and I I mean this essentially is that
I don't know there's nothing wrong with
them it's just my preference but I will
definitely give this a try cuz I do
really like that color and I like the
minty feel this next thing is an
eyeliner by beauty for real and it's
their eye line 24/7 eye liner in black
magic and it's a retractable one which I
love traveling with retractable ones
because you don't need to worry about
bringing a sharpener it's just always
good to go this was very creamy just
like once white does that do it justice
I can never tell it is really really
black really really creamy so I loved
that already I will definitely use this
I'd go through black eyeliner pretty
quickly and the last thing in here is I
gotta open it firm japonesque I see and
it looks like it's makeup Jeff and esque
makes pretty nice brushes too though I
don't own any I always just touched them
at the store and then I never actually
like buy them so it's japonesque oh it's
a blush it's their Velvet Touch blush
and shade zero two looks like a really
nice neutral peachy tone which I wear
all the time it's kind of like what I'm
wearing today on my cheeks you can kind
of see it there just a really nice
lighter peach this would show up as a
highlight if you've got a really deep
skin tone so just keep that in mind this
is not a shade that would work on
everyone but but it's nice it was creamy
looks like it blends really nicely
awesome so the Ipsy in the birch box
they are both always so neck-and-neck
that's what I remembered from when I
used to get birch box every month as
well but if she really kind of showed
them up with this full-sized product in
here and then like the blush I feel like
might as well be full-size I mean not
gonna go through that anytime soon the
lip product is awesome it's the
full-size eyeliner so I feel like it
kind of kicked birch boxes booty this
time around but I'm gonna keep getting
birch box for a bit because I am excited
I still have coffee everywhere you guys
it's like a never-ending spill
last thing is boxycharm and this one is
like double the price it's like $21 a
month but there's usually more full-size
things in it so it makes it I think a
little bit more worth it but again it
depends on what you can afford at the
time etc so it says express yourself
this one actually has the prices so I'll
tell you the prices as we go first thing
wow this thing is filled let me just
show you it's filled with a bunch of
like full-size products Wow first thing
is this Amplatz khara mascara serum okay
this is originally oh the brand is by
makeup eraser and this is originally $23
that is definitely the full-size and
what are the claims it says designed to
be your daily go to mascara a bold full
long-lasting look okay it says the tube
seals really tight
so the rich black mascara serum keeps
fresh until the last use the pro quality
makeup brush is perfect for applying the
mascara to your lashes which builds
volume with each stroke it gives you a
false eyelash full feathered look pair o
paired this with their amplify BER lash
extensions so I don't know I am
certainly excited it says it's safe for
contact lens wearers as well because
tried a couple mascaras that I'm like oh
my gosh so I don't want to open cuz I
don't want to get air into it and I
promised myself when I just did my
mascara declutter which I think I just
very recently uploaded I can link it
below I promised myself I would only
open like one maybe two mascaras at a
time I already have like two open so I'm
going to wait even though it's hard but
I'm excited about that next thing in
here is by beauty for real and it's
their shadow sticks STX Stix and what
shave midnight marathon this one is $19
originally and it looks like it really
is just a classic shadow stick it has a
little point it's a really pretty deeper
gold shade that's the kind of shade I
love on my lids just that kind of blend
it into the crease and that's all you
need it's so pretty and this is one that
you could totally do on your lower lash
line or even just in the inner corner oh
my gosh so that is one I will definitely
use I don't have anything like this
right now
my collection so this will get used a
for sure the next thing is is my dirty
little secret this retails for ten
dollars and it's their velvet matte
liquid lipstick oh it looks like Minnie
Mouse doesn't it oh my gosh all the
polka dots right red oh my gosh it is
bright red it's that one right there wow
that is like Taylor Swift back in the
day red that's awesome kind of an orange
II warm tint to it so I just went to the
bathroom and I wash my hands and
literally the only thing that didn't
come off that red lip stain or the matte
lip was really hard to get off and then
this shadow stick did not move I was
scrubbing it is amazing so that's pretty
cool all right so two more full-size
things in here this is the aloe pure
skincare time Repair Serum Alouette is
the brand and it's $48 what so it really
is just a serum I like that it's got a
pump to smooth away the appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles with age-defying
green tea extract and alpha and beta
high beta hydroxy acids by a small
amount to clean skin in the morning and
evening so I will definitely use this I
am currently working on my advanced
night repair serum that I love but once
that one's out I might give this one a
try and the last thing in here is big
this is this blush and bronzer it's
Coastal Scents okay and this one retails
for well it says Oh 1395 but then
there's a bonus item there's a brush in
here that retails for six dollars a year
where's the brush the brush is a set so
this brush I'll show you first if I can
get it out I'm trapped at the end um
it's like a mini brush this one retails
for six dollars it's really soft I don't
love this shape it's really small so
you'd have to be very very precise which
I am NOT um this one I love how pink and
fun it is this is very spring-like and
it looks like it's got two blushes a
highlight type shade and then two
bronzers shades so let's see yeah
they're really pigmented you can see you
wipe that off my fingers let's do the
bronzer
jiae's pretty pigmented as well kind of
did it on either side of it there so
these are really really pigmented let's
try the highlight I'm gonna put it right
between the blush so you know where to
look mmm I mean that's nice too but
again it'd be way too light for some
people but not really the only shimmer
is in this blush here in this bronzer
and it's a very light shimmer the rest
seemed to be more of like a satin type
finish so I'll definitely give it a try
I never ended up using palettes like
this very often but if they're really
good I will and these all seem pretty
nice so that is awesome for the money my
goodness the boxycharm the total price
would be I'm gonna kind of round here
like a hundred and twenty dollars
actually I think that's a couple dollars
low like a hundred and twenty dollars
for all of those things that's insane
first of all that's a lot for those
things but that I mean if you're paying
21 dollars for that's a pretty sweet
deal so I need to go wash all these
swatches off my hand if I can actually
get them off with some makeup remover
hopefully you enjoyed this I have tons
of subscription box and boxing's on my
channel I will put the playlist below I
hope that you'll subscribe before you
leave and I'll see you guys my next one
