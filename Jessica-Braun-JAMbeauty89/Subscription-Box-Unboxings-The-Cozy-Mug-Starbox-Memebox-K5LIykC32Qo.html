through with you guys so if you are a
subscription box fan you're gonna love
it if you're not you're gonna hate it
so Cheers wise if you want to watch the
video however okay so I have a Meany box
this year with you a Starbucks to share
with you and then a tea subscription box
to share with you this I'm gonna start
with that one because I could not be
more excited about if the brand is or
the company I guess is called the cozy
mug and this is my very first experience
getting one of these and I am so excited
to see what's inside because I freaking
love tea love your phrase I love tea I
also love coffee and I just recently
learned they also have a coffee
subscription box so I'm like maybe I
need both if my boyfriend actually like
will heat love's coffee but he likes see
to so it's good at the ha I'm just so
excited so I can't wait to see what's in
here
so opening the box up these are by the
way or 1995 a month but I think about
what I spend on coffee and tea anyway
and I'm like I mean okay so first thing
I'm seeing is this full moon spice black
tea and this is loose tea I can tell
let's see I see another one that's even
bigger fairytale dreams herbal tea okay
so I'm a much bigger fan of the herbal
tea than I am a black tea but like she's
okay I have to be in the mood for that
you know but really excited I'm excited
that the herbal tea has more in it but
if you don't have I wonder okay looks oh
my gosh okay wait I got it
these must be like stirring spoons you
know to kind of sweeten your tea up but
one of them is in the shape of a teapot
what does this card says some stuff I
wasn't gonna read it but now I want to
know
little buh-buh-buh-buh where is it okay
it says assorted honey spoons or
lollipops these are so cute you'll have
three spoons and surprise shapes and
flavors so I'm really excited about
these these are like big - that is such
a little treat and then the last thing
I'm seeing in here
and here's this baggie of things so it
looks
oh is this a muslin okay it comes that's
genius it comes with a little muslin bag
that you can put your loose tea in so if
you don't already have something to
steep the loose tea they give you
something and these are reusable you
just wash them like rinse them out and
reuse them so that is awesome and then
I'm just oh yeah these go with those
loose teas like they're little twisty
ties that you can use to close them to
keep them fresh so that is genius
gosh they covered their bases here Oh No
so now these must be yes this is enough
I'm looking at it in the light yeah this
is a bagged tea this is the art of tea
white tea fusion white coconut cream
with medium caffeine and it comes it
look it says it's a pyramid sachet in
there I love the pyramid once they're
cute and then the next one is this art
of tea green tea jazz members are oh my
gosh I love jasmine green tea so I'm
gonna love that one so I'm really
excited that they give you a mix of
loose tea and bags teas and then this
last thing it looks like a lip product
hemp organics is the brand
it says hemp shine and it appears to
just be a waxy you know clear completely
clear just lip balm but let's see what
it says why they would include this
that's just kind of funny cuz it's not a
beauty box obviously says it's a very
healing lip balm great for dry lips
filled with organic ingredients and the
perfect protective coating to keep your
lips
burnfree while sipping your hot tea
that's really cute this wow
this retails for $17.25 that's insane
anyway so that's everything it came in
this box is this box not the most
adorable thing you've ever seen okay so
it says we hope you enjoyed this month's
box and are excited to get the July box
out it won't be long before our cozy
autumn boxes ship they love autumn are
you guys autumn dirts like I am oh my
gosh
and I just love even just the logo this
might be my favorite thing I've ever
gotten ever oh my gosh okay calm down so
I don't even know what else to say I'm
really excited just like you guys know I
know I mentioned every freaking video
but I'm sick and I'm tired of being sick
so this tea is just gonna be so nice
with the little honey
and now I'm really excited about the
autumn boxes okay
you know what that would be awesome for
like gifts if you know someone loves tea
or something like that that would be
such an awesome gift to give them the
next thing I'm going to open is this
meme me me box I always say mean box
it's me me box but it literally has
lured me minute that's very tricky this
is their mini box global number 12 like
I said in the very first Mimi box video
that I had there there just seems to be
a ton of boxes they sell and it's not
like a subscription you buy them one at
a time if you want and this one's $23
most of them are so let's see what's in
this one I don't know if it's makeup or
what I don't know we're not gonna look
at the card you know I want to all right
I'm gonna wow it is packed full of stir
this first junkie thing I'd like huge
honkin thing that sound came out very
weird
it's the smooth sensitive removal cream
spray type removal cream it's you can
remove hair anywhere it says okay I mean
I'm willing to try spray type it looks
like it's yeah it is it's like an
aerosol spray okay it's like a lotion I
don't want to like remove the hair on my
hand huh so there's that we will see it
okay it comes with some of the little it
says it's licensed by the Korea Food and
Drug Administration sanitary aide it's
safe and won't harm your body we'll see
we'll see I mean I'm willing to try it
because gosh if this worked that would
be amazing especially in the summertime
but you see I'm is anyway I'm curious
because I'm always like hmm about hair
removal creams or whatever anyone have
any experience with either this or any
kind of hairy moving cream that actually
works because I'm always curious to try
them but I don't wanna spend the money
then they'd not work and then I'm stuck
with it you know so let me know if you
found one that actually works and please
let me know cuz that'd be awesome
the next thing oh so cute the next thing
it looks like it's a nail polish Elvita
is the brand and it's this bright blue
nail polish I don't see like what that
shade name is Oh fat and low it says but
it's cute it's got this little elastic
thing that has the loop see how we're on
it that's really cute
I just know and you know what I don't
think I have a blue this color right now
well I might but I'm trying to I'm got
rid of a lot of nail polish I am down to
like now you know the spice rack that I
use to put my nail polish in I'm down to
like I feel like I'm only using two rows
of it aren't you proud of me and then
the rest are like base coats and top
coats I have too many of those but those
I actually use so I don't want to get
rid of them cuz I'm like well use those
but when I had more than one of the same
color I just picked my favorite and got
rid of the rest cuz I'm never gonna go
through them all ever so anyway so I've
already done that so that's exciting
this next thing is called pledge entra
looks like the word placenta pledge
entra white mark cream what that's the
one iffy thing about getting things you
know from any other country when they're
translating it doesn't quite things get
lost in translation don't they hmm all
right let's see what it says I gotta
know
well retails for $38 geez Louise stretch
marks oh cool okay it's for stretch
marks you know what one day I'm gonna
have kids I might save this do you think
it'll still be good I mean oh no what
I'm gonna have kids but it looks like
because this is says white mark - it's
like a I'm assuming or is it the same
product
yeah just like pouches for travel I
don't know alright next thing anti hair
loss treatment and the rest is in Korean
I feel like I'm like I don't know
all right that's why I'm to say over wet
hair so it says it prevents hair loss
reenergize and strength and then you
know what that's nice because I feel
like us ladies we're all that guy is
back
boy he's truckin but what is he carrying
it's like an elderly man that's what I'm
saying
good for you buddy get out there walk in
but it's kind of stormy out and he's
carrying something huge and he's now
walked around the neighborhood like
twice I'm being nosy
stop Jess it's not your business good
for you buddy still curious though
curious like a kitten okay what I was
saying was you know us ladies we lose
hair all the time and I know it's
natural to lose you know hair but I feel
like part of me it's like I still freak
out a little bit so this might be nice
to use maybe as a treatment every couple
weeks or you know I don't think it'd be
something I'd repurchase unless it was
like amazing and I never lost any hair
ever again but I think it's healthy for
you to lose your hair all right Oh what
is this the packaging is adorable
it's the clay patch for a mineral salt
clay pack what is where do I use it it
looks like a really thick you know clay
like a max is it a clay mask let's see
retails for $21 100% pure mud extracted
straight from the Dead Sea okay that's
awesome removes excess sebum dead skin
and external pollutants that are
clogging up your pores yeah you leave it
on for 10 minutes then rinse it off so
it's a clay mask that is awesome you
know I'm about to use the crap out of
this mmm so that'll be nice I might use
that tonight it's just kind of like a
okay the last thing in here this just a
lot of stuff is the cry cents
professional organic hair essence so
this whole thing was like a face and
body thing I guess it wasn't really
makeup like the last one which is fine I
mean that's nice to get a mixture well
what is this one it retails for $72 who
is paid who has that kind of money okay
towel dry after shampooing apply this
evenly throughout your hair dry your
semi wet hair to finish off
so I'm assuming it's like a leave in
like conditioner or like a well now I
want to know I like the packaging that
it's like a pump like that oh yes so
it's like a hair lotion if you will I
can't really smell oh no I can smell
that one I was gonna say I can't smell I
think is my coal but that one I can
smell that punches right through my clog
nose and so okay I'll try it I mean I
like the packaging I think it's gonna be
easy to use which is kind of nice
sometimes I get annoyed with like that
like right now I'm using that you know
agave stuff with like the medicine
dropper if you will or whatever because
it's a smaller size I think the bigger
size is the pump that the smaller size
has the little medicine dropper so it
sucks it up and I just get annoying I
feel like I get the wheel everywhere and
I'm making a mess and then the bottles a
mess so this pump is gonna be nice I'm
excited to get that a try so that was
everything in that certainly a lot of
stuff but again it's I don't know I mean
I feel like a lot of the stuff I don't
know if I'll use or so but they were
they were nice enough to send it to me
and I'm excited to try some of it some
of it I might pass on to friends but
I'll put a link below for this box if
you are interested and the last thing
sorry this video is turning out to be
longer than I had anticipated the star
box now this is for june and star box
it's $15 a month what is going on in my
neighborhood there's like a lynx and
I've seen this cat before it's a cat but
it's like big like it literally looks
like a Lynx where'd it go at find the
tree but it really is Simba my little
paw guide to pugs but poor semi he'll be
out there and the other name is barking
it like on our side here just freak it
out just losing his mind like dude
what's going on so I go out and I calm
down buddy what's going on and now I
look and I see that freaking Lynx cat
hiding like crouched in the bushes just
like like terrorizing Simba it was
hilarious and you know that cat could
tear Simba apart I'm like three
simmer down because when that cat comes
near you you're gonna run and cry and
scream you won't find that because
you're a baby okay okay
start looks whoa so all of their things
come in their cute little white and
black package mother's thing is cute I
know it sounds silly but I love how
simple it is so weird whatever kind of
like the Mack packaging is all black
with white writing I like that
simplicity okay so this see it's like a
peach color some cream blush and it's in
the shade fallen angel and it looks let
me get it out yeah it looks like this
just kind of pale peach
I don't know watching it it looks like
it might be more of like a creamy
highlight which would kind of be nice
because it has a little bit of color but
really it's more looks like some
condensation is growing on this looks
like more like a highlight shade than a
blush I don't know how much you still
get out of this to be completely honest
it's not really a shade I would wear I
you know what it would probably be
absolutely beautiful on people with
darker skin because on me you kidding
that like blends right into my skin I'll
try to supreme by light all right the
next thing it's the infinity lipstick
please be a good color please
tired I feel like I always get Reds from
starlooks I'm like okay this is in
limitless please be a pain for a peach
it's a dark dark red I just feel like I
keep getting Reds from them and it's not
a color I'd wear I mean I like having a
few Reds have options but we did get I
think last month we got a lip liner that
was that would go really well with this
so that's kind of nice maybe that was
the idea behind it but and I like the
packaging I actually like that but I
don't know if it's coloring where I
might pass that on we'll see but I'll
probably pass them but we'll see here's
no I'm decluttering so this is hard like
I'm trying to be picky I'm like okay
what am I really gonna keep because I'm
if I'm just gonna get rid of it in two
months
why even hold on to it now you know all
right the last thing in here is the star
looks well what does an infinity eyeline
if they keep sending these in son I
would prefer liners that are colored to
just be a
it's just easier I'm not gonna get out
of brush I think I know myself but you
can use these also as cream shadows so
what that is a like pure striking golden
yellow that could actually be really
pretty and you know that could be pretty
like under a shadow like under
half-baked just to add even more like
Vava voom to it yes I just said fommy
how old am I hmm anyway so this is not
my favorite Starbucks not my favorite by
far but again that's kind of a way it is
it seems with any subscription box there
are awesome months and off months last
month I really liked it I think if I
remember correctly that's like the past
few months from Starbucks but this
wasn't my favorite they're just not
really shades I would use but hey it
comes with the territory
and again star look sends these to me
for free to review so I like sharing
with you guys and letting you guys know
you know what you'd be getting if you
were to spend your money that way so I'm
thankful for that to all the companies
that send me things whether I love the
box that month or not so hopefully that
was helpful for you guys and if you
