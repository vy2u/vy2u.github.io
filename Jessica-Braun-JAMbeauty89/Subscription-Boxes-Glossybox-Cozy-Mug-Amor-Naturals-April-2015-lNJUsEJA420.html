bringing you three different
subscription boxes to be unboxed and i'm
gonna start with glossy box which is the
very first one i've gotten from them i
get all of my subscription boxes for
free because this is one of my jobs this
is what i do i'm very very grateful to
all the companies that send me boxes but
you guys know that I'm always going to
give you an honest unboxing a review
because that's my job my job is to be
honest so just trust that even though
I'm getting these things for free I'm
still going to tell you exactly what I
think about them so we're gonna start
with glossy box cuz I am so excited I've
been getting boxycharm for quite a long
time and I love it and it's the exact
same price boxycharm is $21 and glossy
box is $21 and someone is mowing the
grass so loudly
it's $21 you get free shipping and it's
usually got four or five like full-size
products in it just like boxycharm which
is why it's more expensive than like
itse and Birchbox those are $10 because
they're usually sample size or like
deluxe trial size type things which
those are great too i feel like if you
buy one of these kinds of boxes you're
spending your money a little bit wiser
because you are getting full-size
products so I really like that about it
let's go ahead and dig in
so the theme I guess is like pop art
type thing in the box is usually nothing
like this from what I've seen that it's
wrapping it's really cute I'm so let's
do it so right on top is that same pop
art picture oh and it goes through the
products I don't want to look at it yet
so oh it's Pocket packaged all cute so
let's dig and I'm so excited so right on
top is a makeup bag interesting this is
really it actually makes you think of
the Rocky Horror Picture Show but let's
open it it seems like it's actually
pretty well-made the zipper on it is
like gold and it's like a canvas bag
with like this plastic kind of overlay
and then on the inside it says glossy
box by Thursday Friday so I'm assuming
that's a brand - very very cute I might
use this I I'll be traveling a lot over
the next few months and this would be a
great one to travel it because it's just
different and cute I like it okay I just
saw some of the things I'm so excited so
this first thing is by the brand
Marrakesh and it's their ends Argan and
hemp oil therapy and I guess it's a
split end says it's a split end mender
and preventer and it says our powerful
blend of nutrient-rich argan oil from
Morocco hemp oil wheat protein and pants
and all seals and repair split ends
while preventing future split ends from
forming ends will naturally look and
feel thicker with long lasting frizz and
static control so you put it on wet or
dry hair concentrated on the ends
leave-in and style it as usual that
actually might be nice right now I'm due
for a haircut like big-time and this
would be great now from what I have
learned I don't know that much about
but I do know that it's virtually
impossible to actually heal split ends
but you can certainly use products that
make them appear that they're not split
so I would definitely use this and give
us a try I might try it tomorrow when I
do my hair just because I am I think
this is something that would be great
for when you know you need a haircut but
maybe your appointments not for another
week or two this is something that's
great to reach for just to make your
hair look a little bit healthier
especially on the end and especially if
you have long hair like I do so this is
pretty cool
well it's time for a break for coffee
because apparently this person is not
letting up I don't why I'm mad it's a
beautiful day I do not blame people for
cutting their grass today that's still
don't they know I'm trying to film I
don't even know you guys probably can't
even hear him cutting the grass but it
just seems really loud in person so the
next thing this is by the brand Aaron
and it's their water lily Sun Oh de
parfum spray oh okay this is adorable
it looks so high-end it reminds me of
like those the nest fragrances and
things like that what is this
okay I'm gonna spray I'm gonna spray
this card cuz I don't know I don't want
to spray it all over myself and then
hate it it's definitely got a floral
scent to it I like it it's here's what
I'll say it's perfect for spring it's a
very floral spring fresh scent which I
like but I don't like this year-round
like I don't know how people wear
perfumes like this all the time because
for me it's too much but I could see
myself okay I'm just gonna do it I got
it in my mouth actually that smells
better see that's what I get for
spraying it on a car and how could I
even that actually does smell nice it
does have more of a fresh than a floral
scent I like it it's different it's
different than what I usually wear you
can see my perfumes back there I usually
wear like those really like Viva La
Juicy a really sweet kind of scent but
not too sweet it's got to be like spicy
and sweet but I'm moving more into a
spicy and musky stage so we'll see but
I'm excited again perfect for traveling
it's so cute the next thing is oh these
probably the prices on them doesn't it
yes so this is actually $5.99 for this
and this is the full size so that's not
expensive at all this whoa well hold on
how much jeez okay this is a point three
fluid ounce little bottle but for the
full size and 1.7 ounces it's a hundred
and ten dollars the good news is Eau de
Parfum so it'll be a little more it'll
stick around a little longer than like
an Eau de Toilette would do so I'm
excited about that
so the next thing is a julep product I
haven't tried a julep product in a very
long time and it's their Joe I glider
and it looks like it's like it yeah it's
in the shade olive and it's just a liner
of course and I would assume it is whoa
what that's weird
oh it's very very creamy and it
certainly is like an olive green um and
just really creamy you know I feel like
every subscription box I feel like I
always get liner in colors that I made
me will wear but not a ton so I mean
I'll use it probably or maybe I'll pass
it on to a sister now because there's
nothing wrong with it but I just I have
so many liners that are colored and I
just feel like I never give them enough
love and so then a year passes and I
hold on to them and then I never used it
so then I pass it on I might as well
pass it on while it's brand-new to one
of my sisters so it's nice I mean it
really is nice and full size so the
price for that one is $16 and that is a
full size oh and it says that it's
clinically proven to last for more than
10 hours I wish this were in black then
I'm sure they sell it in black but I
wish we'd gotten it in black
oh it says colors will vary so some
people might have gotten black and other
colors I just happen to get olive okay
next thing oh it's a full size OCC lip
tar
however it's like orange like not even
light orange it is orange but I've never
tried one of the OCC lip tar so I'm
actually excited to see what this
formula is like I know these are meant
to be like mixed or you know you can do
all kinds of custom shades if you mix
these things but I mean this is a
straight-up orange and they're kind of
more like a lacquer colors will vary so
other people didn't get orange why do I
need something Orange but the full size
of that one
is $18 and this is the full size so I
mean certainly getting your money's
worth but only if you're getting a color
that's useful to you I mean anyway okay
the last thing ooh oh it's an essay
louder or Lauder enlightened
dark spot correcting night serum now I
have heard amazing things about their
serums and I have this size serum of one
of their other serums I just said that
ten times but this okay it says if you
could see your skin four weeks from now
you'd start tonight from the story
beauty brand comes this intensive serum
that helps reduce the look of uneven
skin tone with a proprietary technology
which works on contact to brighten dark
spots and impart moisture apply on clean
skin AM and PM before your moisturizer
so yes if you don't use a serum yet you
already use serums before you put on
your actual moisturizer and you put the
serum on and you let it sit and sink in
for a minute or two then you put on your
moisturizer and the idea of the serum is
that it's got even more skin benefits
than just a moisturizer typically does
it's got more vitamins and more just
different active ingredients that sink
in your skin and then the moisturizer
helps kind of lock it in but you do have
to give your serums some time to sink in
now I am really excited to try this
because I've got some dark spots from
like I had burnt myself here from
curling my curling wand I'm a moron and
then I had what else did I have Oh like
I had a really big pimple here that I'm
still trying to lighten another one here
so I've got dark spots that I've been
trying this one I don't even know it's a
random ramp it's not really working and
I've been using it for weeks and weeks
so I'm excited to give this a shot and
see how it works I also have
hyperpigmentation here and then like a
bunch of freckles so I'm wondering if
that would work to lighten those as well
I don't know so I am very excited again
travel friendly so when I'm traveling
here soon I can actually bring this and
have a really good skincare formula with
me so that's going to be awesome and the
full-size is $62 this how many ounces is
this one this is like 1/4 of the
full-size this is 0.24 fluid ounces and
the full-size is one so but a serum a
little bit usually goes a long way so
this will probably last a while and this
will be nice for me to decide like if I
like it I can buy the full size because
if it if it works then I will because oh
my gosh skincare is just so important
like once I finally started taking care
of my skin all of my found
Asians look better and I mean everything
looks better when the canvas is going on
looks better so awesome
so that is awesome I would say my
favorite things out of this are the
perfume oh my gosh
the serum and this split end thing I
would have loved the OCC lip tar if it
were in a different shade because this
is awesome I mean these are expensive
and the liner again it's useful and it
seems really really nice and pigmented
and dark but I just wish it remained in
black but so pretty awesome for my first
glossy box I can't wait to see what the
next month's bring to it I'm here oh
yeah the makeup bag Oh awesome
okay so the next thing I'm going to open
is this a more natural and I haven't got
one of these in a while the woman that
is like the owner creator of this has
been sending these to me once they like
first got going and it is $20 but then
it's five dollars in shipping so it ends
up being 25 dollars and they've kind of
what's kind of cool to have been with
them since their earlier days is that
they've kind of they just get better
each time I get a box so that's what
I'll say I think it's really amazing
they always have their car so cute says
hello spring and it goes through all
their different things now it looks like
it's got step one step two three and
four and then one or two other things so
it actually has sent you a whole
skincare regimen this is cool so you
usually this box is like it's usually
like soaps and just a lot of soaps and I
like soap but I don't use it enough I
usually go for more body washes so it
looks like they're branching more out
into bath stuff and facial skincare
stuff so I cannot wait just looking at
this stuff has got me so excited so the
first thing I'm seeing well I'll try
going order step one is the almond rose
so okay so it says step one is to
cleanse your face with this artisan
facial soap and almond rose and it's got
the little sleeve on it but oh it smells
so soft like it's got a really delicate
scent it feels so nice so that's what
it's meant to do first and it says a
lather bar mixing bowl cocoa it says to
lather the bar mixing both colors under
water and lather it on the face rinse
and pat dry and in this description is
it's a balancing bar with nourishing raw
almond milk and over in rose French clay
I love oh my gosh so many of their
products have this rose French clay and
I don't know what it is but they had
sent like a bath bar with that I think
it was like a bath bomb and it is the
most like moisturizing smooth luxurious
ingredient oh my gosh so it says it's
made with organic coconut oil and raw
shea butter so what I love about this
brand is that they're all like totally
natural like oh my gosh so you you know
what you're putting on your skin I love
that so very excited for this now step
two says it's the honey avocado mask and
it's in this little here let me kind of
open it it's in this little jar
it's the face mask and it says apply
math can leave on 5 to 10 minutes use 1
to 3 times a week and let's see a
nourishing mask made with local raw
honey honey replenishes moisture is
antiseptic for problem skin and
regulates excess oil the mask also
contains avocado oil packed with omega-3
fatty acids and vitamin A and eat
awesome so let's see this so it's oh
it's close let me open it oh it's got
more of like a oh my gosh it really is
like a honey-like consistency I am so
excited to try this I feel like most of
the masks that used are like a totally
different consistency so I am oh and it
totally smells like honey and you know
I've heard that using local honey of
course this isn't local to me now this
is local to wherever it's from but using
local honey and eating local honey is
good for allergies to help with your
allergies and I have terrible allergies
in the spring so very excited that is
step 2 in their regimen so step 3 is
there a Gua rose a hydrating rose water
okay so it's a little spray bottle it's
like a rose water mist right says it's
the facial mist designed to balance tone
and moisturize winter parched skin made
with natural rose water Moroccan rose
oil witch hazel and vitamin E oh my gosh
the shake well and mist with eyes closed
to tone him or fresh skin and makeup I
want to try it right now mm-hmm
it does a pretty fine mist so that's
good oh my gosh it just feels nice and
it just kind of refreshes like if you've
got like dry skin here I feel like that
would do a really nice job of refreshing
that okay so step four is there Rosa
Chia face elixir where is that oh look
at this tiny little bottle okay so it
says this potent this potent elixir
nourish your skin and improves
elasticity with organic jojoba oil
rosehip seed oil to correct dark spots
calendula and organic chia seed oil chia
is packed with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty
acids that moisturize and regulate sebum
formulated with luxurious rose absolutes
for a delightful natural scent so it's
literally this tiny little bottle okay
here we go
and it oh my gosh look how cute this is
I want to like feel it without using it
all okay it is truly just like an oil oh
it does smell nice it it sounds like a
buttery rose does that make sense it
kind of smells like oil mixed with rose
I mean that's and you can't see it of
course cuz it's an oil but it did like
blend away like right away oh my gosh
yeah this is apply a few drops to areas
of face required so like it said it's
good for correcting dark spots and
things like that and it regulates your
sebum so if you're really oily here it'd
be good to put it there probably before
you go to bed so awesome and then
there's still more oh my gosh this is
the best box I've ever gotten for them
so the next thing is okay these are some
bad things yes these are my favorite
things so this is their bath melt and
they always are so adorable so it says
drop bath melt into warm water and it
says caution tub may become slip it's
like slippery so it does this one have
the this has rose clay in it as well yes
so I love these I usually Oh
this is softer than most it is a truly
amount I just squeeze sitting it like
kind of crunched down so it's a lot more
melty than most like bath bars are but I
am so excited this is something that you
could cut and maybe use a fourth up for
each bath I am so excited and the last
thing in this box is their bath milk
salts and it says add to warm tub keep
water at a constant temperature so for
10 to 15 minutes while sea salt minerals
detoxify and coconut milk and honey
hydrate skin that is awesome what does
it say about this relaxing bath yep same
thing mediterranean sea salt coconut
milk honey awesome so this is my
favorite a more natural box they give
better every single time and I finally
feel like they're hitting their stride
like the fact that their skin care and
bath stuff just makes it all the better
and the fact that it's all made with
like good natural ingredients not just
random things that don't need to be in
there I love it and they're just so I
feel like they're very picky about what
they make and what they send out I love
that about them so love that again links
for all these boxes will be below the
last one we show you today is from the
cozy mug which I've been getting for a
while and I live so it says did you
notice that instead of a sicker sticker
to see what you box we use a special
surprise magnet so it came with a little
magnet that was on the outside of it
that is so cute and their little thing
is this little owl and I always joke
that say Quan back there my little owl
pillow is like dating this one because
last time they all had a little bow so I
was like oh it's a girl so they're
dating you know so alright so woo so
this time it's all like wrapped up like
truly wrapped so this box is usually
coffee and tea type things and I love it
I love it so much so let's open this one
love the girl wrap this
is $20 in month ooh so this has some tea
yay okay it's the yogi bedtime tea which
I actually have a box of this and I love
it so awesome but if you hadn't tried it
this box is how I've discovered some of
my favorite teas so I love when they
send just random teas so I love yogi
bedtime T and then Adagio teas is one of
my favorite brands this is their long
goddess tea it says it's they're the
most famous of Chinese belongs rolled
leaves that expand with the bouquet of
soft orchids so I'm excited to give that
a try the next thing I've seen in here
is some more Adagio boom
these are like a little blossom tea like
balls it says it's black tea blossom a
hand-woven tea cluster magically unfolds
to reveal a pink flower hidden within oh
my gosh that is so cool so I'm so
excited to try that these can get really
expensive and in such a treat don't you
think so the next thing is that Netaji
oh I love when they send the bags of the
loose tea and it seals itself these this
is the Earl Grey moonlight tea and I
have to be honest I think I've only
tried it all very like once so I'm
excited to give it a try again
oh then they've got like a little like
bag to use for the loose tea in case you
don't have one they sent one so you
could at least try it and what I love
sorry I just started reading this cuz I
just kept going and we realized I wasn't
really saying much about the teas and
they actually give really cool stuff
like cool info like the OL on one I
showed you it says very light and tasty
you can accidentally leave the bag in
and forget about it and the team won't
be super bitter and it's great reused
for a few cups which that's really nice
and then like the Earl Grey moonlight
tea it says time for some magical loose
tea that pairs well with our nighttime
stormy weather box theme oh that is cool
okay you guys know that I lose my mind
over this kiss like it's always themed
like fall or Christmas or holiday and
it's always so wonderfully themed while
this theme is like spring storms now I'm
kind of seeing it here and everything is
packaged in like it was all a gray and
blue and brown pearl gray moonlight okay
bedtime okay now I'm getting it this is
really cute I wish I would have read
that before anyway so it says which one
am I talking about
so the Earl Grey it says this is a
gorgeous balance of flavors the vanilla
lingers longest as an aftertaste and
delicious harmony with the bergamot as
it fades it really does taste like the
top of a cupcake but with the strong
black tea base it makes a great comfort
tea yes we included one empty tea bag
for those without a strainer but when I
was going to say is I use just like a
metal strainer from Walmart and they're
like $2 you can get other kinds and I've
got a few other kinds that they've
actually sent in their boxes that I
still have like there's a burlap is it
burlap I don't even know what it is but
one that you can actually watch and
reuse a million times I use that one too
so okay the next thing in here I see is
chocolate what does it say it's a 70%
dark chocolate yes by divine we are
chocolate lovers it's a kneaded treat on
a daily basis we absolutely love
Divine's line of chocolates especially
this yummy bar of pure dark chocolate
perfect to have at night with a cup of
warm tea while calming down for the day
it's a known fact that dark chocolate
aids and stress relief so enjoy yeah I
will probably eat that after the video
so then the last thing in here oh that's
cute that's like a stretchy oh my gosh
you can actually use it it's like it
okay that's cute that's cute I might
wear my hair okay it's a CD it's a CD
what it says blue stone bonus worlds
apart CD along with the special music
video on the DVD by blue stone I mean
this is straight-up full seat I guys I
can't even tell you the last time I've
owned a CD I'm not even joking you if it
says we love New Age music and this
amazing band is one of our absolute
favorites we especially loved the song
worlds apart which also is a music video
in it blue stone will take you into
another magical world be sure to like
them on Facebook oh that's cool I'm
actually excited it says ethereal sonic
bliss I'm said steroids headfirst into
lush garden soft skies and insoluble
enchantments with rich textures and
flowing melodies I wonder if there's
like if it's all like instrumental
there's words I would be interested to
play this like if it is instrumental if
it's nice ambient music to play this in
my classroom we listen to music when
they read I guess we'll see I have no
idea what to expect but very cool
different I love when they include rando
things like that
so those are the three subscription
boxes I'm in unbox today I also have my
boxycharm &amp;amp; Ipsy on the way so I'll do
those let me know if you'd like me to do
like the cuz this is kind of a mixture
of subscription boxes which I think it's
just kind of fun but if I think what I
might do in the future is do like the
boxy charm of glossy box together and
maybe the Ipsy one since those are more
Beauty focused and then the other ones
are well the so is the more natural see
I don't know anyway let me know what you
think about how to pair these videos
it's hard to do all of them together
because they all come at different times
of the month which is why I include a
glossy box in this one cuz I wanted to
get it up before like the next month
starts so let me know if you enjoyed
this I will link my entire subscription
box unboxing playlist down below if
you're interested and definitely
subscribe to capture my future ones and
I'll see you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
