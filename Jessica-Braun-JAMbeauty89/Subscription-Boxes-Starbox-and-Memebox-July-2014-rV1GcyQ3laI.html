subscription boxes to open with you guys
so I'm going to open a Mimi box and a
star box both of these were sent to me
for review on my channel and why I but
I'm not affiliated with either one of
them so but the links an envelope if you
are interested the star box is $15 a
month and they only give you their brand
of makeup which is starlooks that's
their brand and it really is I mean all
the ones that I've tried they really are
pretty professional there been a few
products they send that are just like
weird colors that I never wear but other
people would so it's kind of you know
hit or miss when it comes to that but it
looks like nylon pink is the theme or
I'm assuming this is like a group I just
never heard of them makes me want to
look them up though they look fun
they're wearing cool makeup anyway so
it's a special edition box which they do
from time to time oh it looks like
there's more in here than usual so the
first thing I see is this star looks
eyes shadow and it's in the shade
traffic yellow hmm and it just looks
like this kind of gold but almost like
greenish gold if that makes no it's
pretty much just gold it's really pretty
though and it is certainly pigmented and
then be a really pretty lit color I feel
like you're wondering what's on my lips
I grabbed it cuz a lot of you guys might
ask its the two-faced two-faced no that
is two-faced
it's the Too Faced la creme lipstick and
loganberry
and okay first of all the package
packaging is adorable but I bought them
these are like originally
twenty-something dollar I don't know
around $20 for one lipstick but on whole
look they were on there recently like
some weeks ago for like eight dollars a
piece I literally bought every color I
was like I don't care because these will
never be that cheap again but I'm
assuming usually products that come on
on HauteLook once they've been on there
once they'll come on again so keep your
eyes peeled
I had the link for hit list below but
this might be my favorite find I've ever
found on HauteLook so I was really
excited but this is in loganberry and I
like it I think it's kind of fun okay so
back to the star box so so far just that
eye shadow
next thing I'm seeing is a tender gloss
lipstick now I have one of their tender
gloss lipsticks before but it like broke
like that I rolled the lipstick up I
guess too far I don't even think I
rolled up that far and it like broke out
and fell out I was a pom so you know
it's in the shade Pooh Bear whoa it's
like this bright orange lipstick it's
pretty though and it's a really seems
like a really moisturizing formula which
is really nice
I hate drawing those that's one thing
about that tooth this - first one it's
really really moisturizing so like that
and this is certainly a fun color I
don't know how often I would wear it
wonder if it'll make my teeth look
yellow or not you know I guess we'll see
so the next thing is this eyeliner in
the shade blue chill now what oh I'm
gonna use the heck out of this it's this
really pretty kind of like aqua blue or
like baby blue almost but it's
definitely got a metallic tint to it
it's just really beautiful and I love
their green version of this it's called
exit to Eden and it came either last
month or the month before and I love it
so I'm really excited about this and it
certainly seems really creamy like it
glides right on okay the last thing in
here is a lip pencil please be a good
normal color ooh oh it looks like a
quarrel it's in the shade tipsy and oh
my gosh it glides right on oh my gosh
it's such a beautiful coral color I
don't have a lip liner in this color but
you know what it is so creamy that I
don't know if this is meant to be just a
lip liner
you're supposed to color and your whole
lips I mean half the time I color my
whole lip with lip liner anyway but this
is absolutely gorgeous oh my gosh so in
this one actually has nylon pink on the
packaging which is cute the other ones
did not and they still don't think they
can I want now I'm wondering about the
lipstick that the lipsticks and go on go
on no only on the lip liner but that
that is oh man that alone is a win oh my
gosh I'm really excited about
that the last things in here just like
looks like a tattoo or a sticker and uh
more things and then it says indulge and
save $15 on what on panty you buy post
in the promo code of Starbucks 15 if I
remember I'll put that below so I guess
it's $15 off panty by post or you get
panties by post makes me laugh okay
grow up Jessica just funny okay so that
was actually a better Starbucks than I
have been receiving most of them are
wearable colors like I'll wear the heck
on the eyeliner I will wear the lip
liner the lipstick we'll see it's
certainly bright which I don't mind but
I feel like I have some of this color
already so we'll see and then the eye
shadow is a really pretty gold and I
like gold like on the lid so I'll
probably wear that as well so all in all
good ones for that one might be one of
my favorite months ever because lately
it has not been as great but that was a
good month okay on to the meaning box
these are usually like I want to say
like $27 ish I feel like each box is a
different price but I don't really know
but I'll be sure I'll look it up
obviously and I'll put it down below for
you guys but let's see what box it is
okay it says Meany box special number 11
okay cacao cacao or cocoa you know from
the cacao bean cacao
I can't stop it's hot okay I'm going
through a lot if you can hear like noise
it's my fan I just realize it's on and
it's really loud okay so in this box
it's chock filled with a whole lot of
stuff so let's dig in alright um I'm
just gonna grab the first thing I see
this says milk tank and it's from the
brand etude house which I have heard of
it's retails for seven dollars it's full
size and it is a body wash and it says
it's got a sweet chocolaty fragrance
okay
this choosy lip scrub love my lip in the
chocolate a chocolate in this is clearly
a lip scrub it retails for $11 and it's
got like beeswax ciao cacao extract
jojoba oil macadamia oil shea butter or
sugar this sounds nice I could use a
good lip strap I don't have one
currently so that will actually be
really nice to use and the packaging I'm
going to open it I know this is
something to eat it's kind of cute haha
it smells like brownies but it's kind of
who this is kind of a nice scrubby feel
but it doesn't feel too - oh there's the
granules this is gonna be nice I'm
excited about it it really is like
straight-up chocolate though I need to
wipe this off but if you don't like that
chocolate smell I would stay away from
this box because I have a feeling that
all of it will smell like it cuz so far
that one did and then the other one said
it did alright the next thing I'm seeing
in here is this pure smile
chocolate milk essence mask and it feels
I mean clearly it feels like a mask and
let me see what it says
yes bull s'eye or the truth of retail
price is $1.00 chocolate milk mask rich
and milk protein nutrients cacao
extracts vitamin collagen they hydrate
and smooth out your skin texture sounds
nice I might try it I've never I have
not found a mask that I just totally
love so it might be worth a shot if I
love it I know that it's only a dollar
of course I probably to order it from
Korea so that's something but anyway
okay next thing so all of this so far is
like kind of skincare isn't it I mean it
sort of knows poor strips
chop choco cacao that's a great name
it's got witch hazel extract which I do
like instantly cleans clogged pores it
says and removes blackheads and there's
six strips so that's nice I mean I'm
sure it's just like the pores or the
Biore ones you know I'll probably will
at least give those a try my boyfriend
loves like the nose strips like that so
I might let him share these I might
share these with him because I have a
feeling he'll like although he's not a
fan of that like fake chocolate smell so
we'll see
all right the next thing well it looks
like there's two more things this is a
cacao brightening mask from wonder
russia sounds sound like one direction
it's not one direction they're not
making chocolate masks whoa this is like
hefty like really well made like glass
it's a mask I think I already said that
let's see what it actually shares your
Barrowman Oh retails for $38 which I'm
not surprised this is like really like
it's made of glass like this is like
it's really nice ooh
so it says that enjoy a luxurious aroma
massage effect with the brightening mask
right in your home
the real cacao components components
alkapone that's what it sounds like for
the mask cleanse away dirt impurities
the mask texture also looks feels and
smells exactly like real chocolate so be
careful not to eat it I'll be the judge
of that
okay
okay this actually looks like real
chocolate also side note totally smells
like brownie batter
this one out of the ones I've smelled so
far which really able mint smell like
what one thing smell is the most like
chocolate it literally looks like
brownie batter which I used to work at
Dairy Queen and one of my favorite
blizzards and I don't know if they still
sell it
what's the brownie batter blizzard oh my
gosh and literally the way we made it
was with real brownie batter while I
mean it was some sort of thing we had
fro you know whatever but it was like
real brownie batter and then just like
brownie bits and I was saying you mix it
with vanilla ice cream is the best
fricking thing ever oh my gosh okay last
thing in here is okay this is adorable
little packaging isn't it
vitamin cleansing dessert oh well it's
kind of cool packaging it looks like you
pop this up oh and then it's closed do
it can I get it out this I got no the
other way well what is this what is it
Ava's or Eva's vitamin cleansing dessert
magic cream soap coconut and cacao
retails for $18 it says um this cream so
works gently and thoroughly with micro
foam particles that reach deeply in your
pores so it's a face a face wash face
okay interesting it this has the really
fake chocolate smell but I don't I
really don't mind it that much it's not
my favorite but there could be worse
smells but look at it it's like a
whipped texture that's actually really
cool so that could actually be really
fun to use you know the only downside is
fragrance and skincare it's not always
the best so that's the one downside
clearly all of this is heavily
fragranced but I might still try
something because I just want to you
never know how your skin will react and
it all just seems so fun and like just
different for a change so especially
like the masks and things like that that
I'm not leaving all my skin I'm taking
off and then rinsing off we'll see we'll
see we'll see but I mean that was
certainly a lot of things is that
something I would have bought for myself
doubtful because that's a lot of
chocolate but if you're a chocolate
lover I mean this would be right up your
really and if you're just wanting to try
different kinds of skin care that's a
fun way to go so I'll leave all the info
for both of these boxes down below
hopefully that was enjoyable for you
guys and I will catch you guys very very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
