a collab video for you guys and I'm
doing this collab with my friends Koli
and desi and their channels are linked
below but Kohli I love because she first
of all I've known heard like since i
started my channel a little over a year
ago um but she does a lot of
decluttering videos and you guys know I
freaking love decluttering video so if
you like that kind of video definitely
check her out desi who I just recently
got to know really really sweet and she
does a ton of like really bright I look
so if you're into that the really
colorful looks you will love her channel
she does tutorials on those and she also
does erin condren videos which you guys
know I'm obsessed with erin condren oh
my goodness so if you also like that
kind of thing check her channel out but
i love these ladies so their videos the
summer essentials videos they're doing
will also be like below of course you
guys know hot collapse work anyway blue
moment before footboy you guys like my
mickey cup duh it's like old school did
I say Mickey I met many that's totally
Minnie Mouse I always get these at big
lots for like three dollars they have
all kinds of Mickey Mouse once all kinds
of like charlie brown ones and at
Christmastime stopped because they're
amazing they have oh my gosh I love
Christmas okay get into it Jess stop
blabbering alright so I'm going to show
the beauty summer items that I really
really like and then I do more like body
and hair stuff so if you don't want to
hear the beauty go ahead and click skip
ahead and it'll take you to the rest of
the stuff if you want to watch the
beauty here we go alright so the beauty
items that I love in the summer first
thing the Beauty Blender whether it's
the actual Beauty Blender brand or the
real technique bran or whatever one you
like these are amazing you get them
moist and then whatever foundation
you're using it makes it look less cakey
and that's the main reason I think why
most people like this it's very flawless
and even in harsh sunlight which sits
around in the summer obviously it
doesn't look powdery and weird that is
my biggest the worst thing is when you
get in the car and I wonder if you is
there maybe when you get in the car and
you like pull down your man you looking
like it's like all powder in your coat
Oh what happened but this I
never ever have to worry about that when
I use one of these so really amazing i
buy mine through Birchbox and I'm going
to talk about that with a few other ones
just because you get points you know you
can buy the beauty blenders anywhere but
you get points that you can use towards
like I think when you spend a hundred
dollars you get ten dollars in like
credit and they sell everything Birchbox
has every brand under the Sun and like
no one shops ever I'm like did you get
better points because with Sephora you
get points but you have to use it just
on certain items with Birchbox you get
those points and then you just get cash
to spend in their shop instead of having
to just pick from six items that make
sense love to be a vendor okay i just
said blue tube london or Bodhi blender
anyway okay speaking of Birchbox I
always buy my polish choice products
from there and I know I keep randomly
bringing up polished choice but I'm
slowly falling in love with it now I
love the website Paula's Choice calm
because they go through and like rate
all of your like skincare items see if
they're actually good or not depending
on the ingredients but they also have
their own line of things that I never
buy them from the website bio for
Birchbox to get the points but this is
the resist super light daily wrinkle
defense with SPF of 30 this is a tinted
sunscreen tinted sunscreen if I sound
different it's because I'm fighting a
cold and I'm like suffering right now
anyway it's a tinted sunscreen which is
amazing because it provides coverage I
literally have been wearing this alone
all the time I almost wore it alone for
the videos like I'll do a little more
big muscle with a little butter but it
really is amazing because it provides a
good amount of coverage and it's making
your skin better as um as you're wearing
it it's got any oxidants in it and all
of the Paula's Choice skincare is just
amazing for your skin but it also like
mattifies in the best way does it look
greasy most sunscreens are so greasy
even if they're marketed for the face
they still are always frizzy on me so I
really have been loving this you can
wear alone it's almost it's like a BB
cream but better just say it another
thing I like to wear in the summer is
cream blush just because it doesn't
again it doesn't give you that powdery
look of a powder blush and I
love the Knicks cream blush in boho chic
it's just this really pretty it almost
looks glimmering on your face but
there's no sparkle to it there's no you
know there's no shimmer in it at all but
it just looks gorgeous I should have
worn it today it really is absolutely
stunning and I just love the Knicks
formula and of course you could always
put a powder blush on top to make it
stay but then again you're back to that
powdery look so I just love this lip
product wise you've got to have a good
lip balm that has some SPF in it every
lip oh I've come across that has SPF
dries my freaking lips out like crazy
but this one is the Alba Botanica very
emollient sunscreen with SPF 25 it
actually doesn't dry my lips out finally
and this I bought on vitacost um that
work yeah and oh that's right because
you couldn't just buy one you had to buy
three like there was a minimum just cuz
they're so cheap I guess they want they
don't want to ship it less I don't know
so I had to buy three but I ended up
putting one of my beach bag one of my
person I gave one of my boyfriend so you
know when that big of a deal and they
were only like five bucks for three
yourself like that but it really is nice
it's perfect um can't say enough good
things about this and speaking of
vitacost you'll see some other ones but
vitacost there's a ten dollar off link
below it's a referral code so when you
get when you click on it you get ten
dollars off I also get ten Mellish off
so it's kind of a win-win so it's up to
you but either way it's vitacost calm
and I love this sunscreen okay my
favorite toenail polish because you lay
these you're probably the same as me
there are certain colors that I just
don't put on my feet you know like they
just don't look right or not cute and
sandals but I have found the most
perfect reddish-pink color that makes
your feet look kind of tan and it just
looks so good it is the Essie nail
polish and watermelon it's just it's red
but it's got a tint that doesn't make it
look like bloody red you know what I
mean there's certain Reds I just can't
do I'm like this looks like blood like
it what I don't know but this one is so
perfect it stays on pretty well I'm not
a big fan of SES formula but I just love
this color and usually your toenail
polish will stay on for a while and
especially if you top it with such feet
it's just like glamorous oh I love it I
just love being at the pool like seeing
my little toes with this on it I love it
all right so live Wise my favorite lip
color right now is this bright coral I'm
wearing it I have gloss on top of it but
I'm wearing it today it's by mary kay
it's their creamy lip color in carefree
coral now this is a limited edition
color it's still available right now my
friend Katie said this to me and she's a
Mary Kay representatives so I'll put her
link below if you're interested but
either way I just love the color any
sort of coral color is fun I have
literally like double fisting I've got
coffee and water and both of them have
lipstick stains on them I'm trying to
stay hydrated because of my cold but I
like neat coffee cuz this morning so
what do you do you just do both anyway
another product i've been loving is this
lacquer bomb from revlon it's in the
shade demure and its really it's got
this kind of glitter in it but it hasn't
bothered me and for me it doesn't wear
off weird and i can apply this without a
mirror those are all wins for me and
it's just a really light kind of nude
color but it's got a little bit of
pigmentation so it doesn't look like
you're washed out I really not
pigmentation but a little bit more color
i guess i should say i really like this
a lot i know some people don't because
of the glitter but i think it just looks
beautiful makes your lips look really
full and just juicy ok so for body care
my number one thing for summer is my dry
brush this I got this I don't remember
the brand but you can get dry brushes
anywhere I find them at marshalls and TJ
maxx all the time you can get the kind
of the handle and then I just took the
handle off it just slid off because I
don't use that I just use it if you're
interested in me doing a video on dry
brushing I'm willing to it's pretty
simple the way you use it you're just
you're working your lymph nodes
basically you're just brushing your skin
towards your heart and it's supposed to
help with cellulite it's supposed to
help with just uneven skin tone I mean
there's so many benefits and on top of
that just helps with flushing toxins
from your body now I've got a skin care
profession I'm not a health professional
so I don't know
you know all the ins and outs of it but
I do love this and I noticed that when I
do it I feel better I always do I try
and do it year round but I do it more in
the summer just cuz you're showing more
skin and I notice that my skin just
looks better it looks more glowing so I
love this alright so deodorant most
important thing in the freakin universe
i buy mine from vitacost and it is the
crystal body deodorant roll-on I love
that it's fragrance and paraben free it
doesn't have that deodorant sent so
you're not like it's not combating with
your perfume or whatever but I really
love this one I noticed that it works
the only downside is you have to let it
dry it is a liquid rollerball so I
usually when I'm out of the shower i'm
doing my makeup I'll put it on like
under my robe and just let it drive on
do my makeup because if I get to the
point that I'm getting dressed and I
have to put this on it tastes like five
minutes to dry so it's but I love it
otherwise and its natural doesn't have
all those weird ingredients and
chemicals that are like stopping up your
system in keeping toxins in this just
it's just good I like it okay in regards
to hair you got to have a good humidity
resistant hairspray for those nights or
whatever that you're going on you
actually do your hair you know a lot of
the summer I'll we're messy buns are
just kind of beachy waves and just chill
but what I do want it to stay or when I
straighten my hair and I don't want to
be frizzy I love this hair spray it's
the rusk freezing spray and the best
part about it it holds well but on top
of that it's still kind of touchable and
it has this smell that is just beautiful
I was wearing the other day and my
boyfriend Tyler came up and like kiss me
right here and she was like is that a
new perfume smells really good i was
like no hairspray awesome keeper love it
love it love it thought that was really
cool dad this year okay so next thing
your skin you want it to look glowing
you don't want to go to the tanning bed
because of course on so two things that
i use on an everyday basis i use the
Jergens natural glow it now comes in a
pump they also sell the firming version
which I like but I just got this one I
don't know what but I was going to
medium to tan because the light to
medium you know I'm fair-skinned the
light to medium just doesn't cut it
really doesn't add enough
but this one adds just enough that you
you know kind of evens out your skin
tone it's just if you really use it
every single day faithfully it really
does darken your skin but it never looks
tricky or weird because it's gradual but
when I really want to look like tan
maybe it's a special event or I'm going
on vacation I want to look good until I
get that tan from the vacation I love
the st. moritz self-tanning mousse this
is comparable to the almost expense once
the million-dollar tan the st. Tropez
but it's way cheaper i think i got this
for under fifteen dollars in i get it in
dark because again if you're gonna do it
go all out and get the dark it's still
it's not like crazy but it looks good
and i just bought the myth that comes
with it the st. boards MIT and it's
lasted me this is the second season of
using it and it's still alive and kickin
it's not ripped up or anything like that
so um i just love it and it's so much
cheaper it comes in a pump and I I have
not noticed streaks I definitely looked
up tutorials to make sure I was doing it
right the first few times and then once
you get the hang of it you're fine but
even the first time I did it it wasn't
streaky so I was pretty excited by that
so hopefully that was fun for you guys
to watch if you stuck through to the end
good job but anyway I hope you'll check
out the other ladies channels in their
videos cuz he should just fun to film
and I'll catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
