out of town and long story short I'm
stopping at Target because I feel like
it and I just watched Holly eats
lipstick one of my favorite youtubers
she did a target like shopping target
with me I don't member what she called
it
and it was so much fun to watch and I I
know I've done like a at least one like
shop with me kind of a vlog style haul
but this is more of a I'm gonna buy a
lot of makeup because there's a lot of
my list of things I just want to try
that's at the drugstore and then also I
just need some new like I want some
fresh jewelry I need a fresh purse
I'm just kind of that mood to treat just
treat yourself treat myself and so
that's what I'm gonna do today I'm just
you ever get one of those moods like you
know what I work really hard I'm gonna
I'm gonna treat myself today so I'm
excited I'm gonna try not to get too
much we'll see all of these myths this
one was interesting the vitamin makeup
mist the orange blossom and citrus
extracts
I'm looking at pics and the only thing
that seems new to me that I haven't
tried are these highlighting duos this
one dozen delicate do it can I try that
what I'm gonna try this and then this
looks like it's a liquid liner but you
like dip it in that you like
squeeze it out so it's like maybe more
creamy yes please are you kidding oh
they have cars too and my trusty
favorite drugstore mascara I'm gonna buy
another one of those shadows because I
really like one that I own so I wanted
to try the glow down Oh cocoa and then
this is soft pearl okay this is another
favorite but I always get it in
waterproof it's amazing for lower
lashline stuff or if you just like
separation more than anything but I'm
gonna try the regular and very black
also I had no idea that number 7 had my
shadow palettes are you kidding me get
the nude one also gonna get a matte
lipstick in the shade whipped to caviar
because I saw someone they were actually
declaring it but they loved the shade
when I saw this watch I was like mmm
gonna need that
so remember jimboy pencils I'm gonna get
the shade cashmere for like inner corner
that's so pretty
so I'm thinking about trying one of
these quads from Revlon then I caught my
eye of course is super boring but I love
it and lit but I'm
those are totally cut like that's a
complete look to me like I could totally
get away with that for every day maybe
okay
what
getting one need to try it doesn't even
talked about these because I'm gonna buy
this on that one I don't think I like
those colors but if you're getting in
her these okay I don't need one but my
favorite types are lip gloss is eat
Rimmel one and blushing Belle grace it's
so goodness freakin 399 it's so pretty
oh and by the way now Sonia Kashuk only
sells brushes no more makeup kind of sad
I get it but I'm kind of seven oh my
gosh they are so freaking soft what give
up they let her have one left a fair
like which I think I would be I've heard
these powders are amazing and their post
when other drugs are favorite this is
the best sponge I've ever used very own
like we're gonna see only on two maybe I
get another one they're so good getting
a few things I actually need
and some things I kind of need but it
mostly craving like orange juice no no
no no recess that's really all that's
gonna tell my gosh
the baby I also make my heart start
pounding so cute and this is where I
feel overwhelmed any recommendations
guys we registered for one but I don't
know we want one that we can use our
smartphone with I know that much so any
recommendations so I always come look at
the organizers and I like never buy
though I love looking at them no I want
all of them I even like the wooden ones
those are nice too I have some similar
to the ideas here kind of digging the
size of that not digging the price 1699
geez I get so much in there
it's cool that they stack although I
don't think I would really stack them
but that's like that's kind of cool I
don't know guys what do I need I don't
think I need any of this I mean I know
hey Joe but these Isabelle maternity
tops with like the ruched siding are the
best I think I own like two and now I'm
back for more so I'm gonna get this
color I think I own gray and like pink
maybe I only own one now that I'm saying
that out loud they're so good they're so
comfortable
okay the target near me this is the
entire maternity section that's it
oh yes two for 22 Maternity tanks the
ones I got are like way too big and
they're not fitted and I really want
fitted one so I'm just gonna get a black
I'm getting a small and a white I'm
thinking about a grey but I think I'll
be fine without it I think I can make do
with just a white and black okay know
maybe agree how cute this is it's like a
sweater tunic oh my gosh yes these are
so cool they're like stretchy headbands
and I get ready using these so I'm
totally gonna use this in real life
answer videos the movies aren't those so
cool they're like so 3d sometimes I see
my own shadow in the mirror with a baby
bump and I'm like who's that oh my gosh
that's me if you look at these cute
spring purses
I love the lavender but I don't like any
of these bags like I need something a
little less structured for right now and
so I'm kind of leaning towards this
cause it's still structured but there's
plenty of room and I can just put on the
loan
thank you and I always get sucked into
the Clarence jewelry look at how cute
all of this stuff is it cracks me up
though sometimes I'm still like okay
that's still $10 it's not that cheap so
I'm gonna grab these they're $2 aren't
those so cute and then these really fun
like bright blue ones
they're like six bucks oh yeah that's
not cheap I'll just average them out so
they're $4 apiece I'll just hide it up
really quickly I grab some sports bras
and some other stuff it's gonna be a
little money getting it okay I just saw
this bag and I think I might like this
one better than this one it looks like
it's more more feasible for everyday
well spent way more than I anticipated
and now I've got to go home and I'm
gonna eat some Reese's on the way and
it's gonna be amazing so thanks for
tagging along with me and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
