get something off of a registry for a
baby shower tomorrow coworker and then
get some more groceries for our
Christmas meal because half the hain't
okay first of all him is so expensive
like I knew it was kind of pricey but
not like 40 50 60 70 80 90 dollars
pricey I was like oh my gosh what in the
world it's just I am I love him but geez
so that's what we're planning on having
for his family when they're over this
weekend's were like well we need to buy
it so I'm kind of shopping around we
were at Meijer store near us yesterday
we were like mm so I'm gonna look at
Target and Walmart want to go to Walmart
but um I just always feel like I wait in
the longest line at Walmart at least the
one we live near like forever so anyway
so I'm gonna start at Target and see if
I can get everything I need there we're
gonna see but yeah so that's on the
agenda I'll vlog while I'm there so I
walked in the door before going to the
store and I saw that Tyler has already
set up for our meal what are you crying
about
hi puppy boy mm-hmm you're getting fixed
tomorrow I know you're not gonna be
happy with us anyway but um doesn't that
look nice he's been cleaning the
apartment all day it looks so lovely
it's perfect because we've still got a
couple days beforehand and we'll still
have to kind of wipe down a lot of the
stuff but um it just makes me feel a
little more ready what about you mister
yeah you know we can focus on cooking
and we still and we wrap presents yet so
we got to do that too
yeah that's true at least all the
cleaning except is done yeah it looks so
nice
love me some target you to also look at
the sky oh my gosh awesome you got a
primo parking spot we got here at the
right time yeah we did you guys I
finally found it
it's the javel yeah they do those like
lattes I showed you guys in like one of
my blogs givings well I've been looking
for the Pope peppermint mocha latte
forever my sister told me about it and I
finally got it at Target these are
amazing though I'm trying really hard
not to go to the makeup aisle so I don't
find more but I really want to so the
hands we were looking at yesterday were
forty dollars for ten pounds this one is
$23 for ten pounds yeah
I cannot believe the price difference I
mean it's I mean it's Archer farm which
is the classic classy stockings so I'm
finally relaxing and we are about to
watch the Disney parks DVD which we used
to get this from the library but we
finally found it was like five dollars
on Amazon for the blu-ray and it's just
like a bunch of behind-the-scenes Disney
World Park stuff which we love so we've
both seen this like a thousand times but
I'm excited to watch it and I'm drinking
that peppermint mocha stuff that I
showed you guys that we got and it is so
good oh my gosh so it's just nice to
relax and I'm editing at the same time
I'm gonna edit the vlogs from the other
days and hopefully get that up tonight
so I just got back from the post office
after work and these two boxes were in
my few box so I'm gonna open them and
see what they are and I'll share that
with you guys so it is from what's the
it's at quirky Stewart collection and I
think it's for that time the month like
it's a box that's supposed to be so if I
can find I'll link any websites I find
for that but I see hot patch and you
know other essentials but don't see some
like candy and just yummy goodies for
that time in this is cool so I thought
mahogany teak wood oh that's one of
Tyler's favorite scents from there so
that was awesome and then I think in
this box oh yes I might get some of this
right now some tea and some chocolate
that's awesome it's from the candy club
and they've asked me a lot to do videos
for them and I always just say I mean
what I typically tell companies is feel
free to send me stuff if you want but
I'm not guaranteeing that I will unbox
it on my channel you know sometimes they
will like if I'm really interested but
I'm like no cuz if it get more candy
I'll eat it I have very low self-control
so but I guess they sent it anyway but
oh
what kind is that does it say oh here we
go
no it doesn't those look good though
they look like little gummies and then
ooh some more gummies lots of gummies
but then there's lots of hard candies
and stuff so that's pretty cool so right
now I am waiting on Tyler to bring
Pinocchio home from the vet because he
had his very special procedure today
that young puppies get if their owners
so choose so I'm excited to see him I'm
sure he's all groggy and like mad at us
but I already miss him I can't wait to
see him hi handsome oh my gosh he was he
was not having a great day he so they
said didn't you tell me they says we
like wouldn't sleep all day he's used to
sleeping like when I haven't work and
stuff never wonder both at work and so I
well we should get like I love you they
won't they said yet they said if he
won't leave it alone we can get a cone
but they're like he should be okay yeah
especially so he's used to sleeping all
day and he didn't sleep at all so he's
he's so tired but he won't just lay down
and go to sleep he can't commit his eyes
are so red they said he just was
screaming all day because he's a big old
beast very vocal and I walked in there
like oh he was loud I'm sorry I love our
men no oh yeah they're great they're
absolutely right boy she's lay down
buddy
sleep ice are so good I know that you
can put like a lube on his eyes because
he wouldn't even suppose him yeah he's
like I'm worried sick about mine and
they say every time that they walked by
he would start crying and so you know
tugged at their heartstrings they would
go and like touch him for a second and
then they'd walk away and it'd be ten
times worse after they walked away
give him how's the cookie with we all
right Bobby just give it a dare
yeah okay all right so right now I'm
drinking some jasmine green tea and this
is a little mug one of my students gave
me this week are those cute so hi I just
