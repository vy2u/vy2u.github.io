I'm using a different computer than I
did for my last live hangout whatever
because I was using my own computer last
time and it just kept freezing up and I
think it was partially out Internet and
also partially my computer I've had my
like MacBook just standard regular
MacBook for ever it seems and I I guess
I don't treat it well because it's
always broken it never works like
everything like loading iMovie where I
add in my videos I will click on iMovie
and wait like five full minutes before
it's like actually ready for me to do
anything with it it's terrible and then
all you just like I'm right now I'm on
my husband's MacBook Air and like I
clicked on things it's just like
instantaneous I'm like I need to like
debug my computer like take it to
someone that actually knows something
about computer isn't like actually fix
it anyway so right now what I have
learned is that I have to actually go to
this video on YouTube to find your
guys's questions and comments because
like if you were seeing what I was
seeing I'm actually on Google Hangouts
and it would be like on the right side
and the first time ever did this well
recently I'm like no one's here no
somebody has me questions but I finally
realized that you guys were there but
you were elsewhere so let me find I need
to actually go to my video oh oh okay I
think I see it okay yes wait it says
comments are disabled no that's not what
I wanted how do i edit it hold on I'm
literally using two computers right I'm
so high-tech let me go advanced settings
allow comments it says a lot of comments
sort by newest first as Norma um I don't
know how to do this you guys this is
horrible
wait my on blonde and a displaying eye
certain ad before my live thing please
um hopefully you guys are there
you only don't know what to do
I was recently watching oh my gosh this
is ridiculous
make it like edit this video video
manager um I was watching Colleen
ballinger or Miranda sings here on
YouTube
and she was doing like a live thing and
she was having the same problems I'm
like yes like that made me feel so much
better so I'm like I feel like such an
idiot with these kinds of like
technology things I just can't figure
them out how do I allow comments like
why in the world would comments not be
allowed yeah it says allow comments all
creates me okay now let me see is anyone
commenting wait I see it oh my gosh
there you are okay wait I see it on the
hire thing let me see if I can like get
it on this how are you guys doing this
you guys literally don't put that such a
dummy
alright oh there you are okay oh my gosh
you guys have commented a lot sorry it
took me well alright let me go to the
top Sue's be asked what my favorite
perfume is right now it is the UM oh my
gosh I gotta close this or something
it is the versace bright crystal
I just recently talked about in a video
and it really is so so so good so then
um it just smells like clean and good
and everything um a great do I teach
Madison won't be I teach fifth grade so
I teach everything and I love it um
alright hi Guys hi Dinah or Dina sorry
Cassandra Cindy Lou
Selma how do you grow your channel fast
I don't think there's I don't think
there are shortcuts but I mean there's
not unless you're like one of those
people that would pay for things like
that and I just don't get that because
you know you're gaining things in
organically at a word and it's not real
like why even have the numbers like even
my 5th graders they love YouTube they
watch youtubers and they'll say oh I
know what a hack it or I know how to
whatever so it looks like you got you
know a million subscribers I'm thinking
in my head cursor fifth-graders but I'm
thinking my head like why would anyone
want to do like what would be great so
someone else thinks you've got a million
but in real life you don't so there's no
I just don't get it
um hi Menna from Egypt Romina hi Julie
from Belgium that's so cool Sarasota hi
I see you she said we're here I'm Indian
- I jag
thanks for saying my hair looks nice I
it's just my natural texture um hi from
Virginia baby girl
Julie hi from the UK that's the coulomb
dislike everywhere um oh yes Danielle
asked where my new desk is from so that
one back there which I don't know if you
guys can even see it is from Outlook
shocker because I buy everything I own
from hautelook but um it's I want to say
it was like 100 dollars it was like
originally 300 or something like that
you can kind of see it back there but it
just has two drawers that pull out and
um I just love it and I've been wanting
that forever because I do those everyday
makeup drawers and I haven't done them
in months I literally film one today
actually um I haven't done one in months
because I feel like it's just I don't
know I was just tired of my house Shores
I guess I like those but like it was too
many drawers so I would just fill them
with stuff I didn't need or want or
whatever so I really downsized except
for I do need to declutter and I'm also
filming today I live 60 clutter of that
top drawer right there I asked you guys
on snapchat which my snapchats Jim
buting 89 but I asked you guys on there
like if you wanted to see a lipstick
declutter - screenshot that snap and wow
it was overwhelming so I will because
I've got way more lipstick than I had
before when I did my last lips to
declutter which wasn't even that long
ago alright Kelsey I'm so high tech
Jessica you make me laugh thanks hi
Anita from Argentina um Casey cow asks
or Cassie I'm not sure if any of my
students or staff watch my videos I know
a lot of the people I work with at my
new school know I do videos I don't know
that they really watch watch them I know
they've seen some um in my first a boy I
went on an elf trip recently so I had to
take like two days off of work so they
knew I was gone and I told him where I
was so they saw some and stuff I'd
posted on my like personal Facebook page
they saw some pictures so you know they
figured it out they asked me about it um
you know some of the ridges did some art
and that's kind of normal my kids my
students know and they watched some of
them feel like in my old school more of
my students watch my videos which I I i
think i prefer it now where less of them
watch come on
I don't do anything inappropriate
there's nothing but even still it is
kind of just it's a very different
dynamic I will say that it is very
different um hi who Lisa or julissa from
Houston hi from Scotland Alexandra hi
Monica hi wings ballerina thanks my
lipstick is I know my lighting is like
really weird I have like partial I've
got like my ring light over here and
I've got my just like some box lights
over here I just look it just looks
crazy um anyway my lipstick is NARS
Barbara I think or something like that
hi Amanda from Kansas um so the reason I
wanted to do this is because oh my gosh
I'm seeing so hi Sara from New Zealand
that's so cool um I'm trying to scroll
down to like the newest just to see what
you guys are asking now the reason I
wanted to do this
is Kyra said hi from a boring place a
cave Pennsylvania oh my gosh
um the reason I wanted to do this live
video is I wanted to talk there's been
something on my mind guys there's
something on my mind two things actually
firstly I feel like I'm so far from you
guys and I want you to know that I love
my YouTube job and because I'm also a
teacher it's it's really hard to do both
it is so hard and I'll actually like I
should like turn this down or off no
it's almost like worse off alone just
you like low whatever just steal that
guy's I can't I my hair looks crazy
alright anyway I feel like because
teaching takes up so much of my time
naturally because it is my day job and
it's you know a certain amount of hours
I have to devote
it and then lesson planning and grading
papers and just thinking about it
planning reset cleaning but anyway um it
takes up so much my time so as you guys
probably know I pretty much only film on
the weekends and then throughout the
week I can edit not flow so obviously
you'll see me in the same outfit for
like 3 or 4 videos etc and honestly I
have never I mean I don't remember ever
reading a comment not even a single
longer people like oh my gosh why are
you standing like no one you guys are
all so amazing nobody says like weird
mean stuff to me like that because
reality is it doesn't matter be you guys
are just I've got this amazing group of
subscribers that are better than anyone
elses subscriber like you guys are just
incredible but I do feel like I want to
connect with you guys more I'm
constantly wanting to talk to you guys
more and it is so hard um to keep up
with you know my Instagram and my
Twitter and my facebook and my snapchat
em especially my YouTube like I want to
come back to all of you guys sorry I'm
like losing my breath I want to comment
back to all of you guys and I want to
feel like I'm connecting with you guys
and I feel so far from you guys because
I can't say is up to date with you
because I'm filming only once a week and
then uploading so you know those videos
say I filmed on Sunday for example and
I'm uploading it on Friday or even the
next Saturday sometimes you know I feel
like sometimes it's not as up-to-date or
I I don't know I don't really know how
to describe it but I feel far from you
guys makes me think of that song so far
away my husband Tyler loves that song
and I like it drives me nuts I don't
know why anyway but that's how I feel
and so these kinds of videos make me
feel closer to you guys and make me feel
like I'm actually talking to you guys
but I told you there were two things on
my mind the other thing on my mind is
that I watch a lot of like gossip videos
and I don't mean like well I don't
really know how to explain this and I'm
not gonna say names you'll probably be
able to figure them out I'm subscribed
to a few gossip channels not because I
like watching the
but honestly it's more well I guess it's
entertaining but not because of who
they're talking about because typically
everyone they're talking about like I
watch and like so it's not but it's more
like I'm just seeing you know what are
you guys thinking when I first started
my channel I looked at like guru
gossiper I don't need more I just don't
and a lot of you guys gave me that
advice you're like you know there
there's no good that will come from it
people are gonna think what they think
and they don't know and you know what
kills me is just makes me laugh I talk
to my family about this all the time I
am a totally normal person with a normal
job like I'm wearing a normal shirt like
the people like will look at my
subscriber count' be like ol 307,000
you're they're definitely rich and
stuck-up and you know live in that
youtube life I'm like what is that
YouTube like like there's no it is
totally a facade something somebody just
dreamed up that is like what youtubers
must be like and even when I watch like
jaclyn hill or you know anyone else has
got you know millions of millions
millions of subscribers their life is
normal yes they do these weird you know
things where they travel and that makes
their life a little bit abnormal i say
weird because it's abnormal but it
doesn't mean they're any less of a
normal person it's like actual
celebrities like they're not any less
normal i was watching on does anyone
watch that sunday morning show on CBS
I am literally monologuing right now I'm
sorry I haven't answered any questions
right now I'm just modeling but I
watched the Sunday morning show on the
CBS we watch it every Sunday and I don't
know if it was today or maybe we were
watching some ones that we miss from
past Sunday's but any Redmayne was being
interviewed and I've never really seen
any any movies he's been in but he's
going to be in the new Harry Potter
movie which I will definitely see but um
he was being asked about uh you know
something about being a celebrity or
something like that and he said you know
that's a sillies question I'm a normal
person I have feeling like there's
nothing different about me I just also
happen to be in movies but that's just a
certain you know for some hours of a day
and then I still live my normal life you
know and it's it's so humbling to
remember that everyone is a
and it doesn't really matter what you do
I mean that's just your job and just
because one person's job might highlight
their life more than other people's job
everyone's still the same there's no
difference and that's one of those
things that you just have to keep in
mind you just have to keep in mind and
so what kills me is when I used to read
guru gossiper it used to make you feel
like oh my gosh like I just want to tell
them all like no that's not true or no
but I'm like it doesn't matter if they
already feel like they don't like that
person whether it's me or Jacqueline
hill or Jeffrey Stewart ever even funny
for myself to compare I'm it's funny for
me to compare myself to them because I'm
not even close in totally different but
but you know if someone's already made
up their mind about someone odds are
against you that you're gonna change
their mind what why even waste your
breath like it's not worth it it doesn't
affect you and one of the things that I
always keep in mind you know when my
feelings get hurt
usually you know more so now in real
life if my feelings your real life like
where it's not just someone buying a
keyboard saying something mean about my
eyebrows or my hair or my nose or my
mouth whatever you know if you keep in
mind that it's not something that
physically hurts you you know I can't
physically feel it let it go like it
doesn't matter that's someone you know
especially if it's on YouTube
that's someone I'm probably never going
to meet your life and if I did ever meet
them in real life they probably wouldn't
say the same things to my face maybe
they would maybe they're just that mean
and they would but it's just a different
world you know it's just very weird very
weird all right so the reason I'm
telling you all of that let me get back
to my questions um oh my um lots of spam
same spoon
thanks.thanks saying saying um but what
the questions I want to um you guys are
so sweet um I have asked if someone
someone asked me if I'm LGBTQ support um
I have so many friends that are lesbian
gay bisexual you know you name it I was
in theater there's I believe tons of my
friends so yes
all right it's totally out something
though so the questions I would like how
to stop procrastinating I know Sofia
stop I know this is like you should see
me teaching my students I've taught them
to do this if I get off on the tangent
they just do this to tell me you're
getting off on a tangent go back to math
or whatever you teach anyway um so what
I want to know from you guys is what are
your questions about the deep dark
dungeons of YouTube like what do you
want to know about sponsorships or um
what else or just even like PR samplings
or packages you know what a what a
companies tell you to do what do they
tell you not to do because I've watched
a lot again getting back to those gossip
channels I have watched so many that are
horribly misinformed they have no idea
and I'm like you can't say that if you
don't know what you're talking about
like and I'm not a person that like
speaks out I'm not going to get on there
like comment really mean but I think it
but I'm like you know what if I actually
know the background of that they don't
know what they're talking about none of
its true so I feel like someone needs to
get out there and say what's actually
happening yes there are a lot of
terrible companies out there but the
vast majority are not terrible companies
they're normal people that it's their
job and they want to be a good company
they want to be honest they want so a
lot of what you're hearing on a lot of
gossip channels and just channels dinner
are not true now some of it is true so
again there is a dark side to it but
what do you want to know so what
companies do I get product samples from
oh one on e I mmm
one seven I'm sorry I don't know exactly
how to split your screen name apart so
what companies do I get product samples
from here's the thing some companies
will just put you on a PR list so no
matter any time they're going to send
out a package you're on that list you'll
always get it whereas others they'll
just send you an email like I just got
contacted by MAC Cosmetics that's the
first time it's very big deal to me like
I literally cried because I love Mac but
you know they're more Spense if I don't
buy from them all the time but some
companies like Mac will put you on like
a PR sampling email list I don't know
how to describe it but we're basically
don't eat excuse me I was drinking like
um mineral water it's picking me
that's the downside about live I can't
edit that out like I used to
anyway um but like Mac will email me
just there like when there's some new
collection that comes out they'll now
email me and if there's something from
that collection I want to try I would
email back and say I'd like to try this
this and this and then there's a chance
they might send it to me a lot of times
are sold out so I can't but that's how
that works
and then there's another version where
um you know you're just kind of randomly
sent stuff I don't know if they have
like different lists because you know
I'll see other youtubers that have about
my size will get different things than
me so you know I have no idea it's very
weird but typically it's just like
you're on a PR mailing list but
sometimes it'll just be a one-time thing
and I don't know if it's companies like
Urban Decay it's very random I'll get
things from them and it's it'll be a
random thing like I'll get a random
eyeshadow palette and like there's one I
got one of their new ones spectrum
palette that I'm planning on doing a
giveaway giveaway with because I opened
I'm like wow that's beautiful but I'm
never going to use it so that's one that
I would you know using a giveaway for
you guys um but so Urban Decay has sent
me stuff
pixie wait yes yeah pixie Pacifica I
just did a video with them so they're
like fresh on my mind not with them less
like about certain products oh sorry
sorry I've got like two computers in
front of me I think I'm closing it um
what else I've never got anything from
like NARS um why am I like blanking on
it the companies of semi-things L'Oreal
has sent me some things um mmm
I've gotten a lot of things through
Influenster so it's like from companies
but it's not necessarily directly from
the company it's either through a PR
company or it's through you know
influencer so like I've gotten thanks
from Maybelline and covergirl things
like that through them but not directly
from them um what else I feel like I
need to look okay I'm gonna get up you
guys gonna laugh cuz i'm in p/j bottoms
just look these are pretty awesome
though look look at these babies I got
my slippy slippy all right let's see um
Oh
all right I got a few more in my head so
like it cosmetics pure cosmetics
um I don't know I mean there's a there's
a lot there's a lot o Alf I get things
from I mean I've got connections through
them and I've got to know a lot of them
from the company so of course I get
things from them um it's a lot and again
like I said it can be kind of sporadic
but again speaking to PR packages I see
you know some other people asking about
like how does that work like you know
all that with a PR they send you things
you could throw them in the trash
like you have no obligation whatsoever
unless you've like emailed them and you
say yes I will feature this in a video
or something like that you have no
obligation to them to show any of it to
ever mention it which is why there's a
lot of things I just don't show you
because you know in a given week I'm
getting anywhere from like 5 to 25
packages from companies whether it's my
peal box or to my actual address you
know depending on whatever but there's
no obligation so you don't have to show
them so I want you to know that if you
guys are watching a youtuber that's
showing something that they even say or
maybe you learn from their Instagram or
snapchat that was sent to them from the
company it doesn't mean that it's
sponsored that just means that yes they
happen to be sent it but then they tried
it out and maybe they actually liked it
heaven forbid they actually liked a
product that they were sent and they
want to actually mention it in a
favorites video or a tutorial or
whatever you know there's nothing wrong
with that I mean the company's trying to
spread the word about their own company
and you happen to try and like it
there's nothing wrong with that I don't
see anything ethically wrong I mean the
only thing ethic wise is that it was
sent for free but typically myself and
other youtubers youtubers would mention
hey this was sent to me for free but I
really like it you know things like that
um another thing that's happened to me a
lot is you know I might have done a
sponsored video with the company because
I really love to product and then I
happen to mention that product in
another video or an Instagram post or
whatever and those aren't sponsored just
because I'm just mentioning like for
example I just filmed a video today in
my empties video it'll be a
probably sometime this week but it was a
vino and I would did like Instagram
sponsored posts with them like months
ago like over the summer actually I
remember I was in Disney while posting
one very weird anyway but um it was no
Vee no post and I love you know and I
loved these products so I was really
excited to do it and I just finished
like one of the products so I mentioned
an empties and I'm like you know just
because I was sponsored in the past
doesn't mean this is sponsored like a
vino probably has no idea I'm filming
this video I just love this product like
genuinely loved it that's why I wanted
to do the sponsored video all right
what's a - I live in um I live in
Indiana we do a double date at
Disneyland
it's awesome yes pajamas um how do you
get sponsorships so I've talked about
this a couple times you know you can
throw a million websites there's really
oh and rough fluence and fame bit
although famebit was just bought by like
google so if you've ever used it or
heard of it they were just bought by
Google so I don't know what's going on
seems like it's like a really big deal
but um those are like platforms where
you can just sign up it's free and you
know link your YouTube channel or your
Instagram whatever and then companies
can find you and they can contact you
and then of course you know most of the
time like no thanks you know if it's
nothing I've ever heard of or I'm just
not interested or I don't think it's
gonna make any sense or you know maybe
I'll even get to the point where they'll
send me it and I'll try it and then I'm
like okay no I don't like it so I'll
write back and say no thank you I don't
like it you know and it is what it is um
so um alright so Kate
and asked your honest opinion about
companies taking youtubers on these
trips and accusations that product
quality is going down do you think they
should focus more on the people who are
saving hard-earned money I will say it
is kind of it is such a weird world and
the thing is it's all new it's still
very new in the reality of time even in
the you know the timeline of computers
in the internet it's still very new that
beauty companies are sending so many
products to youtubers and influencers
and bloggers and instagramers whatever
and that they're you know putting all
this money into trips and stuff I
watched a video of some youtuber Iman I
think oh my gosh she went on this trip
to like I think was Morocco or somewhere
and I was like drooling I was like Tyler
you need to watch this this is
unbelievable
her trip is amazing if he was with
either clinic I think was Clinic um
anyway but like elf to sent me and like
others on this trip to NYC although
actually I think I was only one of a
couple that were flown out there most of
them were from New York City
but regardless that doesn't matter the
money they're sinking into that you know
you asked like you know how is that
affecting the company like how worth it
is it to them to put that money into it
what are they expecting to gain out of
it and you know like for example my
parents were like you know why would
this company elf do that why would they
spend so much money you know for you and
maybe 20 or so others to you know go on
a helicopter ride through New York if
you haven't seen the vlog I'll link it
it was really thought it was amazing and
elf is a really amazing company but why
you know is it so that there's a chance
I mention them on my channel because
that seems like a lot of money to spend
for the off chance that because I like
the company I would mentioned products
of it you know what I mean so it's to be
honest with you guys it's kind of a
mystery to me like it just seems wild
that they would spend so much money and
New York is one thing but they've got
like you know somewhat of a base in New
York you know thinking of like that
video I watched Morocco like that is
that had to be an exorbitant amount of
money what is the company Clinique
expect to get from the youtubers and
bloggers that they brought there you
know like it's just interesting to me
and I don't know the answer that I'm
honest I don't know the answer that
they've never said oh because we're
sending you on this trip you needed it
that's never happened um now the reality
is I've only gone on one trip like that
that one to New York because I you know
I do have a full-time job and it's very
hard to take off time and you know to me
I wanted to be a company I actually
really liked and care about in health
I've always loved and I've done tons of
videos for them before I they even knew
who I was um all right let's keep going
I gotta get beyond that I could talk
about that forever um
oh is it caress maybe Oh Mariana is from
Morocco that's awesome um did I change
my background not really I mean a little
bit that's now over there and it's kind
of catty corner and I talked about the
desk at the beginning that I got and I
just I just simplified like one youtuber
I love to watch his a Marie or Allison
Anderson anyone else watch her comment
if in there if you watch Allison
Anderson I love her now I will say she
does a lot of sponsor videos and you
know there's not I can't talk because if
a company contacts me and I love that
company it's hard for me to say no
because I'm like why would I not take a
sponsorship from someone I believe it or
a company I believe it or a product I
believe in like that just seems dumb to
me I'm being honest with you guys that
seems very dumb to me if a company
contacts me that I love or a product I
love why would I not say yes of course I
will do a sponsorship with you I mean
it's like almost saying here's a raise
would you like that and me saying no
thanks like but if it's I mean you
should know that in a given day I'm
turning down like 15 different companies
every day so it's not like I'm accepting
everything that comes my way it's not
like that at all but yeah I see like
Breanna just Allison Anderson I do feel
like I will say this I love her so I
watch every video hers I don't care what
it's about I watch them all because
she's got like a simplified background
it's just so like I just love the feel
of her videos I don't know what it is I
just love her but I will say I feel like
she's only done sponsored videos like at
least for me like if I know like I've
got a lot of sponsored videos coming up
with products and companies I love like
I did a sponsor video a Sephora just
recently and that was the most exciting
thing I've done in so long because I
love support like why would I not
support a store that I shop at every
month like it was so exciting to me um
anyway but yeah I feel like for me like
if I'm doing a ton which like its
holiday season there's a lot going on so
if I'm doing you know a couple sponsored
videos in the next month I try to be
good about spacing them out and putting
you know normal you know my videos that
you know you would see regardless of
sponsorship in-between so you guys don't
feel like I'm just doing sponsored
that's it and I don't even take the time
to film regular videos for you guys so
hopefully that makes sense um but I
don't think there's anything wrong
response for videos for the right
reasons hi Isabelle young she said
notice me um alright so hold on I'm
losing my place I was talking about
Allison Anderson someone said who are
you talking about Zehra
sire said that um vlogmas a lot of
people are asking about wellness um
probably it takes so much time you know
and like it's hard because obviously I'm
teaching most of the month so it like I
can't I just don't feel right vlogging
in the middle of my day like even doing
prep for lunch I don't know I just don't
feel right so I don't usually do that um
but I'll usually vlog like in the
morning as I'm getting ready and then
like once I'm off the rest of the night
so it's a lot of my holiday shopping and
um things like that
now we're gonna be traveling over
Thanksgiving and I think this is the
first time we've ever traveled ever
Thanksgiving the actual holiday so I'm
planning on doing a vlogs giving as well
and um that is always fun and it did
vlogs giving last year and it was like
the whole week of Thanksgiving that was
really fun because we did Black Friday
shopping at Target in other places and I
got a ton of stuff so I'm hoping to do
another Black Friday's vlog as well as
like my Black Friday um like wish list
or not a wish list but like Black Friday
gift guide like I'll go through Sephora
and Ulta and like I don't think I did
Target I would like to do target this
year though and just talk about what
they're offering this year and what you
should look out for if you're thinking
about doing it things like that that was
a lot of fun I can link those below as
well um
okay a lot of you guys are asking for
more singing videos now I have to be
honest with you guys
if you've noticed my voice is a lot like
scratchier than normal I don't know I
think I might have vocal notes I and I
don't know if you've ever had it you
could probably speak more to it but um I
literally like I can't sing the way
here's to like it's the saddest thing
like I want to cry even talking about it
because like I'm like literally about to
cry I'll be in the car and I'm used to
like singing on the way to work and on
the way from work but like since like
April and so April May June July August
September
that was not countering April May June
July August September October
so like seven going on eight months I my
voice is just like gone like I can speak
from like the decibel I'm at not the
decimal but like the level I'm at in
lower but like anything higher like
nothing comes out and I've never ever in
my life experienced that it's really
emotional for me clear exam like legit
Aaliyah bout to cry but anyway um so I'm
just now on my insurance at work so I
want to like go to an ENT or someone and
look into that and see if there's like a
surgery I can do because it's so sad to
me like I singing is such a big part of
my life and I don't really share that on
YouTube much because it's it's just
different like if my channel is based on
beauty and stuff I don't always feel
right singing all the time on my channel
it's not quite what I started it for but
everyone small include it like a vlog or
like there are tons of videos um if you
look up my maiden name Jessica Murphy
when I started my channel um there's
tons of videos on other people's
channels that they've uploaded to me
singing just sit random you know and
performances and shows I've done that's
how my husband and I met in a musical um
anyway so what we need to figure that
out but we just got my insurance started
like with my new school district that
I'm teaching in so I need to get into
that and like figure that out because
it's it's weirdly depressing it really
is and I just need to calm down
um editing software Christy I saw you
asked that I just use iMovie I would
love to eventually use like Final Cut
Pro there's a lot more you can do with
it but I haven't seen enough of a
difference between them that I feel I
mean it's a couple hundred dollars I'm
like so far I mean I've been doing this
for a couple years now and I don't
feel the need yet I think eventually I
would like to but um yeah okay I gotta
like hold my tears back um they have
nasal sprays that will get rid of vocal
notes okay well yeah you're I'm gonna
have to look into that
what lighting do I use I never have of
course the lighting here is crazy but um
for my regular videos I have I can show
you these box lights and there's my
camera I just kind of pushed it off to
the side right now and I have my ring
light there um I usually have the ring
light in front of me and then I have the
box lights usually have one like kind of
over to the side because I have my like
daylight there's a window there when I'm
filming in daylight which is rare um and
then I have the other one all sometimes
you just kind of like I said hair light
kind of from behind on the side it just
kind of depends
I haven't still after all these years
still never found a system of lighting
that I like now I got these like box
like shadow box type lights Tyler got
them for me for Christmas last year and
Ashley was a set of like I think six but
I've only sent two up because we have an
apartment there's nowhere to keep them
once you like set them up so we have the
rest like hidden away and locked away
just for now we're looking at getting a
house in like April when our lease is up
here we lived here for about two years
and um well maybe like a year and a half
now so it'll be about two years so we're
looking in the housing we've talked to
you know art we've got our realtor and
stuff so we're looking at April and I'm
so excited because we're waiting on a
lot of things for house so I'm very
excited yes this is natural I see Julia
just asked that do I play pokemon go I
do not do IP record makeup with Mack yes
I have I just have to because I'm a
teacher that's what I was mentioning
earlier I just record a bunch on the
weekend I wish I wish I could film
throughout the week like that is my
dream there's just I could but it would
be the most stressful thing in the world
like there's an it wouldn't be worth it
because if it show through in my videos
excited for Christmas Annabelle
yes I am I just shopped if you saw my
snapchat I just shopped to Ulta um for
like different gift sets and I'm filming
it soon I want to need a couple more
things so it'll probably
more weeks before I actually film it
have the video up but it's gonna be a
drugstore gift guide of like beauty
thing so I got some stuff in Ulta but
it's not nothing from like the high-end
side it's only from like the drugstore
more affordable side of things for the
most part and I want to go to like
Walgreens in the CVS and get some of
their gift sets and let you guys know
what's actually worth it what's not what
you should get people that you know you
don't really know what to get but it's
still not you know breaking the bank
because the reality is like I did my
Sephora gift guide but a lot of it stuff
is really expensive like it's not
realistic if you're buying a bunch of
people things so I'm really excited
about that
yeah I agree Heather said some of these
comments are a little too personal I
totally agree um but you let it roll off
um Joffrey Baratheon said would you like
to be the queen of Westeros that's so
funny if you want to Game of Thrones
that's awesome I can't wait til Game of
Thrones comes back um why are why am I
so confident I don't know but I just
knotted about it um I wouldn't say that
I am but I guess I've got a part of me
that is only because I used to be so shy
and I don't know feel like I just hit a
point run like you know what whatever
like I used to be so concerned about
like what people thought of me and like
every little thing I wanted everyone to
like me and me to do everything that
pleases everyone like you just can't
there's no way and maybe Miss YouTube
that taught me that then after a couple
years of it I was like you know what no
matter what I do no matter how careful I
am what I say what I show what I there's
always going to be a million people that
find fault with it so why try and cater
to that small demographic of people that
are gonna hate me anyway and why not
just cater to the people that love me
and that like care about me and that
aren't so mean and that are kind and
thoughtful and understanding and smart
and so you know I just feel like I don't
know that's been a realization of mine
that you know I'm 27 years old
I cannot believe I still feel like I'm
like 22 in my head I'll be 28 in January
but and maybe that's part of it too but
I just I just kind of reel
guys it doesn't matter I'm gonna do what
makes me happy and what makes the people
around me happy and then you know if
that shows through in a video and it
makes most of you guys happy awesome
there's gonna be people they're gonna
hate it anyway or hate me or whatever so
why try and cater to them like I'm not
going to change their mind so who cares
um people are asking about babies um who
knows who knows
um preach it girl thanks Isabel um how
do i man it a lot of people are asking
about how I made it to being a teacher
and a youtuber like I said filming on
the weekends helps editing throughout
the week but I'm going to be honest with
you guys there are times it happened
last week it happens every other week
where I get home and I'm so exhausted
and mentally and emotionally and
physically drained from teaching and if
you're a teacher or you know a teacher
you understand and then I also like a
need to edit a video because it's been
five days and I want to edit a video I
want to get videos up and comment back
but I'm so exhausted I'll just cry and I
you know I'm getting emotional again but
like I just you know I'll get that point
where I'm like Tyler I am so exhausted
and I you know why am i doing two
full-time jobs why am i doing this to
myself
but then I remember how much I love
YouTube and you guys and I remember how
much I love my students in teaching and
I can't see a day where I would quit
either one I just can't and so I'm just
kind of in this really weird crux where
I don't want to quit either one so I
just don't think I've ever gone on I
would be fine ish on either salary and
that's the honest truth with you guys
I'd be fine on my teaching salary I'd be
fine on my YouTube salary but it's not
you know it's kind of it's not about the
money I do them both because I genuinely
like it I genuinely love it and so I
don't know that that's ever gonna happen
um thank you I see some people saying as
a teacher I respected so much know noria
son stall sorry it went away before I
saw um
somewhat I'm trying to like keep up okay
what okay I see Bri Burch said I've
noticed a lot of beauty givers don't
want kids because they think a child
will stop them from doing what they're
doing how do you feel about that love
your channel thanks Bri
um I've never really thought about that
I heard that but I will say I guess you
know thinking about like a lot of the
really big youtubers mmm but most of
them I can't think of any that have any
kids but you know when you think about
your life in the grand scheme of things
it's not about your job as like if
YouTube is simply one of my jobs which
is simply not because it really is
deeper and just totally different more
personal than that
but you know if you think about your
life and the grand scheme of things
babies and family are so much more
important not baby's necessarily but
family is so important and and it is to
anyone I mean whether you're religious
or not doesn't matter family is family
and you know so if you're inclined to
have kids I wouldn't think that would
stop you from having kids so it's sad to
me if that is true like if there are
beauty gurus or you know whoever that
would not have a kid because of that
because of their career that makes me
sad if they were inclined to have kids
now they're one of those people that
they just it's just not in their
interests or you know for whatever
reason they don't feel like they're
called to have kids or maybe they are
trying they just can't then you know
that is what it is that you know that's
a totally different beast so I don't
know that's something interesting I've
never really thought about ever honestly
um alright oh thank you
GSXR kicks to lease that she's over 50
and she enjoys my channel thank you I
really appreciate that because you know
sometimes I feel like you know there's
some subscribers of mine that are
younger and I don't mind that but it is
nice to have people that like I that you
know I don't ever want to feel like I'm
totally out of base when it comes to any
demographic I want to be able to be
accessible to all of you guys because
the reality is like some of my friends
are way older than me
my friends are younger than me so it is
it's nice to have that balance where you
know I do have a range of subscribers
and it's not just twelve year olds or
just eighteen year olds or just 25 year
olds you know it's I like that that I
can relate to lobby guys so thank you um
how do you get paid from YouTube um I'm
just being so many funny questions sorry
um how do I get paid from YouTube so I'm
gonna be honest with you there's a lot I
don't understand about YouTube period I
genuinely when people ask me that I I
mean obviously I get paid from like when
an ad plays before my video I get I
guess some chunk of that you know some
but from what I realized you know I can
monetize your unmagnetized video and
that means there's literally in my
settings when I'm uploading a video or
later I could do it whatever I can click
monetize or unmonitored now it usually
it defaults to monetize you haven't said
that way and that's what most of my
videos are I mean naturally this is
still a job of mine but you know there
are some videos I'll do that if they're
too random no it seems that you know
even if I monetize that no ad will play
before because either there's no brand
or no um you know no company that wants
to advertise before that subject matter
you know what I mean like it's very
weird I do not understand this world at
all there's so much I don't know and
it's so frustrating because no matter
how much I look up stuff about this I
still don't understand it and I don't I
don't think I'm an unintelligent person
like you know I feel like I can learn
stuff pretty quickly but after years of
researching it I still don't fully
understand it so it's still kind of a
mystery to me but you know obviously I
get that obvious and paid from the ads
and if my video is watched more often
than I'm gonna make more money on it but
I'll even see videos that I don't know
if it's that there are certain ads that
will make more money than others but you
know I don't really have a say in what
ads play before the video whereas like
um there are I remember there was one
thing where I was able to choose like I
don't member something like if it was
like you know if it needed to be 18 or
over should I allow that and I think
click no like I want it to be
family-friendly ads only something like
that I remember exactly the wording and
that was a while ago I haven't seen that
since then but um anyway so yeah and
then of course like if you do
sponsorships you get paid for those if
it's a true sponsorship that's one other
way you could um yes I see the trolls
and it's fine you guys you just overlook
them and it is what it is um um to do to
do to do to do what I love about trolls
is that they spend the time on here
they're spending the time with us guys
don't you feel happy that they're
spending their time with us how special
do we feel that the trolls are here with
us and they're wasting their own time
doing that like that's what kills me
like when you rather be doing something
more intelligent no apparently they
would all right would I go back to work
if I had kids probably again well used
to definitely I mean that wouldn't
because you know like I'll watch
youtubers telling the youtubers i watch
have kids or they just had kids or
whatever but you know those so have um
they'll still do videos you know when
they're napping or you know if someone's
watching them whatever it might be so um
yeah almost Ahmed said how many
subscribers you need to make a living
well it depends on what you view as a
living I don't know um I don't know what
the threshold is for like when you can
start being monetized like you have to
be like a YouTube partner or whatever
because it was a while ago but I know
like for example my husband has I don't
know exactly how many subscribers I want
to say like 13,000 or so on his channel
and he's been monetized for a while um
you know what I'm saying so let me
search I'm going to look like on my
phone could my case by the way I really
like this case it's from I honestly I
don't know what that brand is if you
know what it is say it but I just like
it it's like a soft but it looks like
Marvel it's a cute tie they're brown no
bran um okay Oh
I was way off he has like almost 17,000
is Tyler good for you
um anyway but he's been monetized for a
while like a YouTube partner now does he
make a ton of money off of that no no
not a living so and of course he's a
traveling like he is a totally different
day job but um he just does it for fun
and it is fun but I will say we
sometimes will argue over like hoot not
literally argue but like kind of riff
over who will get to upload a vlog on
whose channel so I got a song like oh I
want to do vlogs giving like a lot of
people are asking about that the week of
Thanksgiving what we're traveling he's
like we usually do travel vlogs on my
channel Mike I know but like I do Bob's
give me on mine I love to draw mine
he's like but I was like well we could
just film
tons of vlog footage and you whatever
you film on your phone can be your vlog
and whatever I show a mine will be mine
so we'll see what we actually end up
doing because um we'll be in Asheville
North Carolina and I'm so excited I've
never been there I don't even know that
I've ever been to the Carolinas it's
only like a seven hour drive for us but
we're gonna bring Pinocchio we found a
cabin in the mountains and it's gonna be
so nice and it's exactly what I've been
like wanting just kind of a more naturey
trip but it's not so far because I still
want to do Black Friday shopping so I'm
really excited so um yeah so if you live
in Asheville or you've been there what
do you recommend that we do I'm very
curious
cuz I've got some ideas like are kind of
already written out that I want to do
but you know I've never been there so
it's all so new to me it's kind of
basing a lot of it off of a Trip Advisor
um all right what kind of camera do I
use I use a Canon t5i in it sorry it was
it I mean it's a really nice camera but
I feel like they're nicer cameras out
there for on the same price so really do
your research
Kathy asks how I'm liking the morphe
palette she sent me I love it Cassie I
was literally just looking at it I
didn't end up using because I was using
some some eyeshadows I was featuring
today in a video I love that pal it's
amazing um side note
shameless plug my husband is a Disney
travel agent so if you want to book
anything to Disney World or Disneyland
or Disney Paris or whatever contact him
he can also book any other travel like
he does trip said Ireland Ireland London
Italy I mean he's done so many amazing
trips for people or play
one like a river cruise and I'm really
excited through this company called Alma
waterways which they're like if you look
them up they're like top two you're
amazing but he's found some amazing
deals through them I am so excited
because like river cruises you can do
them through Europe and see like cities
you maybe wouldn't see if you just flew
out there like you wouldn't necessarily
spend the time to take a train out to
them but on a river cruise you know it's
kind of like you know you're
disembarking in those places so it could
be a little more random and I'm so
excited I hope it all works out um
London shout out hi Marcus thanks
Rosaria Rosario she said you and Tyler
Rock um how did we start getting into
Disney World I I don't know um as I told
you before and some like q a's I've done
like I was engaged before I met Tyler
and it was just a bad match just
all-around and I thank God that I meant
Tyler what I did and I mean anyway
that's all in the past but um that was
actually my first trip to Disney World
was with my ex-fiance and it was such a
negative experience I just like forgot
all about it like I you know you had
white things from your memory that were
bad wiped it from my memory it's the
weirdest thing like I'll think about and
I cannot remember a single instance with
that man they're weird anyway but I went
with Tyler like you know a year later or
however long and that was just when we
were dating and it was just this is the
best experience and it just totally
erased all the bad and so from then on
we just went but I never went as a kid
like we just didn't sorry I forgot I was
like zoning out reading a bunch of
questions hi everyone um yes Joffrey
Baratheon you just got a sub from the
King Joffrey I thought you were dead
feel like uh
I got like a ghost subbing to me but
that's pretty cool not that far beyond
uh October um Melinda asked if I'm still
running yes and no I will say I've
gained a wee bit of weight lately um but
um yes I mean I still run like each week
at least once but like I used to run
like three or four times a week I want I
need to get back into it because I'm
technically should be in training
because I'm running the half marathon in
G an early early January in Disney World
I'm so excited and Tyler is actually
doing the mayor the is that the dopey
challenge where he does the 5k 10k like
the 5k Thursday 10k Friday half marathon
Saturday and then the full marathon
Sunday but today he literally ran 20 wet
like he hadn't run in months in those
months literally other than like three
or five three to five mile runs he
literally left today it was gone for
hours and came back ran 20 miles like it
was nothing like are you kidding me he
ran like all the way to my school and
back which is like a really long drive I
was amazing
anyway um all right yes I'm excited
about the beating to be smoothie I and
of course please know that beating the
beast my favorite is move all-time but
knowing that it's Hermione playing it
like I love Hermione

I'm like you know I'm gonna know like if
I ever really want to do that I will
know when it's right you know I'll just
feel it but I haven't felt that yet I'm
like why spend the time effort etcetera

an emotional journey I don't know but
you know I wanted to really mean
something and to really feel like I'm
backing it for the right reasons so so

against it by any means but I want it to
be bright so um
