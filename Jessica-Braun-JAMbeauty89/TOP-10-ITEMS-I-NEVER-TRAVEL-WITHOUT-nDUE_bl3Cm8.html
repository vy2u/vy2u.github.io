gonna share with you ten products that I
always travel with I never travel
without these are not necessarily some
of them are very specific some of them
are more general but they're things that
you know if you're packing for a trip or
you're planning a trip whether it's a
big trip like a honeymoon or something
like that or maybe it's just a road trip
these are still products no matter what
that I don't travel without I'm saying
that like ten different ways I don't
know why but I'm actually really excited
Tyler my husband thought of this video
idea because I was like you know I just
filmed to get ready with me today and I
was like I just feel like filming some
more do you have any great video ideas
and he's like why don't you talk about
like the things you travel with all the
time because he knows he's got he's a
travel agent we travel a lot he has his
system of packing he has his packing
list I have my own packing list I have
my phone and I use the same one no
matter what the trip is and I kind of
just copy and paste and then delete
things as I packed them that has nothing
to do with this video I guess other than
um sorry I put a setting spray on just
now and it's like still drying on my
cheeks it still feels wet anyone you
know that feeling anyway alright and I
might throw in some bonus items at the
end because I keep thinking of more
things I should mention that so we'll
see first thing I always travel with
this one's not necessarily beauty
related but I always travel with a
really comfortable sweatshirt hoodie
something so like this one I got at
Victoria's Secret I can find it was
honestly kind of pricey am I kind of I
mean it was extremely pricey but it's
one of those things that I'm like it's
so comfortable I wear it all of the time
it's like my favorite color in the world
and they had of course different colors
so I'll try to find it Lincoln I'm
assuming it's still available I just
bought it like a month ago but I always
travel with at least something even if
we're going to a beach where I know it's
gonna be 8090 degrees
I still will bring at least one sweater
whether it's for the plane ride whether
it's because I get cold at night whether
it's cuz it's chilly on the beach at
night whatever the reason might be I
always end up meeting at least one warm
you know sweater II item and I usually
don't need more than one unless I'm
going like a couple years ago we went to
London over like Christmas and New
Year's
it was cold I was bringing a lot of
sweaters so on to beauty items one thing
that is worth the splurge in my opinion
is find your favorite hairspray in
travel size so
reason I say it's worth to splurge is
because my favorite hairspray is like
$20 it's the bedhead masterpiece it
smells amazing it is it's my favorite
air spray I've never found a hairspray
better where it holds my hair but it's
not super crunchy but it definitely
holds it it smells really good
throughout the day it will add texture
to my hair and the way that I need it
too especially like if it second day
hair I like this more than dry shampoo
because I can just spray it in my hair
it gives it that texture so I can throw
it up in a cute messy bun and it holds
so this the travel size of expensive
hair sprays are still expensive like I
want to say the travel size is like
eight bucks or something but I found a
sale like last year and it was like
three for ten dollars I was like done
and I just bought like six so I invested
because I knew I would use them and
traveling with your favorite hairspray
there's nothing better it's like
traveling with something you know always
works for you whereas before I would
just grab whatever was in you know like
the Travel section at like Target or
wherever I'd be like oh Tresemme that's
fine well trust me it's not my favorite
and so every time I travel my hair never
looked as nice as it does at home and
I'm like well and then when I found
these I'm like duh totally worth the
splurge so that I know that's a very
specific tip but for me it's kind of
changed a lot for me and it's really
made my hair look a lot better warmer
traveling
another thing I never leave home without
beauty wise is a really good travel
mirror this one I bought on HauteLook a
long time ago I can look for similar
ones to link and of course I can link
HauteLook cuz they'll have travel e
kinds of things like this on there all
the time and it's like 50% off but the
reason I love this is cuz the mirror
itself is protected this takes up
virtually no room in my luggage I can
slide it in my makeup bag and it's
perfect but I can set it on a table top
and get ready with it it's just big
enough I need to clean it before our
next trip it's just big enough that you
know I can see my whole face but it's
not so big that it's like difficult to
pack so I love this it totally again
like change the game for me when it came
to travel there's nothing worse than
being in like a hotel and like trying to
get ready in like a tiny mirror because
your husband's in the shower and the
mirror happens to be where the show you
know what I mean so that kind of solved
that problem for me next thing I never
leave without is my
favorite perfumes so this is just a
little travel oh I bought at Sephora a
long long time ago you just take the cap
off your perfume and just kind of pump
it into there it's easier than it sounds
and right now I think I have Miss Dior
in there which is my favorite perfume
and I just love it it's so nice again to
have your favorite perfume I sometimes
will bring little perfume samples but
again if it's a perfume that I don't
really know that well in a sample and
I'm like oh I've tried it once or twice
it's good but then I bring it as my only
perfume and I don't end up liking it I'm
like oh man I'm stuck with this and I
wear perfume everyday I'm a I'm a big
perfume person so I'd rather just bring
what I know I love now sometimes this is
just a fun little side note sometimes
Tyler and I depending on if we need like
a new perfume or cologne you know if I
already have too many perfumes at home
we don't but like for example on our
first cruise a while back ago we both
went to like the you know the nice shops
they have on cruise ships and we both
invested in a nice perfume and cologne
and it was so fun because the entire
trip then we would use that perfume and
cologne and so we started to have that
scent memory with that perfume and we've
been doing that for quite a long time
now every time we travel or many times
when we travel and it's so fun so like
now I have that when it's YSL black
opium I guess that wasn't the first
cruise we went on it was just anchored
anyway but now every time I spray it it
makes me think of that trip and it just
so every morning I'm like ah anyway
that's just a fun side note next thing I
always bring is good skincare you guys I
can't emphasize this enough if you're
already into skincare like when you're
at home do you need to bring your entire
skincare regimen no and for me we're
usually flying and we almost never check
a bag so I've gotten really good at
taking clear bags and fill in that
sucker up with travel size so for me
like when I've got Sephora perks you
know like you can get 250 Point perks
500-point perks I will look for skin
care sets for that and they oftentimes
have them because those are perfect
travel-sized toiletries especially if
you find a brand or specific products in
there that you know you already like now
I say this with the caveat because I am
always nervous
I don't usually travel with skincare
I've not you
cuz you never know how your skin might
react to it and you don't want to be on
a vacation where you're taking pictures
and your skin have a bad reaction to
something you know so I try to be really
good about either trying it out a couple
times before I go or just making sure
it's a product I already know so for
example this is something I've actually
just been refilling this one I clean it
out and refill it
it's the Clinique take the day off
makeup removing balm and I love this
stuff
I will refill it all by a full size I
need to refill it before we go but it's
just really easy and I like that this
doesn't have to go in my liquids bag
because it's a bomb
I can usually just scoop it and it takes
my makeup right off I know I can trust
it I know it's sensitive on my skin the
drunk elephant Lala retro whipped cream
it's not my favorite moisturizer but it
is one I've been using so I know my
skin's fine with it
so that's one I feel comfortable
traveling traveling with now the other
thing like within this same one bring a
serum if you're used to what using
serums every single night bring a serum
with you because when you travel you
know you might be in a different climate
all of those things do take a toll on
your skin and of course if it's a long
flight it definitely drives your skin
out you know all of those things so
keeping your skin healthy while you're
traveling is huge because that's gonna
affect how your makeup looks when you
put it on in the morning before you go
out and take pictures and all these
different places and so for me I used to
say oh well I need more room in my
liquids bag so I'll take the skin care
out and I'll just put in you know
whatever I need room for I started to
realize like you know what Jessica you
need to cut back on the makeup and bring
more skin care because that's what's
really making the difference in how I
look on the vacation does that make
sense so I kind of had a shift when it
comes to that but love bringing skincare
with me does that mean I bring every
single step like a toner and all that
not necessarily but I always bring a
serum I always bring a good moisturizer
things like that next thing I always
travel with is my favorite lip balm so
right now my favorite lip balm is the
cap re lip love that's actually what's
on my lips right now because if for some
reason I forget lip products at least
having a lip balm now the reality is
anywhere you go you could buy a lip balm
it might be more expensive depending on
where you go like for example we're
going to Disney everything's more
expensive there and they probably are
not going to have what I like genuinely
we use but lip balm is so
important your lips get so dried out
traveling mine do anyway and I feel like
when I'm traveling I try to drink a ton
of water but it's never as much water as
I drink when I'm at home and that as
well I feel like takes a toll on my lips
so I love bringing my favorite lip balm
of course my favorite lip balm I feel
like changes all the time but this is
one that I really like another thing I
always bring is something to hold my
hair back when I'm getting ready this is
one of my favorites I don't know where I
got it but it really is my favorite but
just some kind of a stretchy headband or
a headband so that way when I'm getting
ready I can just hold my hair back get
ready really quickly and I don't have to
feel like I have to pull my all of my
hair up this just holds it back enough
especially like if I've already done my
hair ish for the day and I don't really
feel like you know throwing it up and
maybe ruining that style these kinds of
things are the perfect answer and I
always bring them I use them when I'm
washing my face at night I use them when
I'm getting ready in the morning it's
one of those very used things that for
the longest time I didn't travel with
and I really missed it so that's
something I always remember to bring
another thing in the idea of skin care
depending on how long you're traveling
if you're traveling for like two days
you might not need to worry about this
part but I always bring a mask or two um
I don't bring like five mass like that's
kind of crazy I don't bring a big old
tube of masks that I'm because I know
realistically we're probably not gonna
have the time to do masks but I like to
bring at least one so one of my favorite
quick ones is called pet it's from the
brand Pathology all of their masks are
good but they have these flash masks
that are five-minute really quick masks
sometimes I'll do them in the morning
before I'm getting ready like maybe I'm
brushing my teeth with it on no that's
kind of hard to do brush your teeth of
the mask on is kind of weird and gross
and you get toothpaste in it's really
gross but like maybe I'm drying my hair
or I'm kind of drinking some coffee I'll
throw one of these on and it really
again it gives you that moisture back I
freaking love these but then there's
other options too like Sephora has these
sleeping masks where really you get a
couple uses out of them and they have
different ones for different skin meats
like for example this is the green tea
one that's good for mattifying and anti
blemish but you just put it on your face
like a moisturizer and you sleep with it
it's it's so easy it's so quick you
could share it with your partner whoever
you're traveling with nug has really
good face masks these are not sleeping
ones these are ones you leave on for a
while and wash off but those are great
also even like I
treatment so then actually my student
and her family actually got me these but
they're the college and gold powder eye
mask so there's all kinds of things like
that that you can bring you know for me
my eyes get tired so I really I think I
am gonna bring like these - probably
with me on our trip um so just bringing
a mask again if it's a shorter trip you
probably don't need to worry about if
it's a longer and you know you might
have a little bit of time you know even
doing it right like at the halfway point
of your trip I think can make a big
difference another thing I always bring
is jewelry however I'm bringing this up
for a reason first of all I always save
like when you get like little things of
jewelry I'll save the bag I don't save
all of them like these are the only
three I have but that kind of limits me
on what I can bring because I used to
bring so much jewelry way too much I'd
bring like six pairs of earrings and
five necklaces and like four bracelets
and I'm like I don't even in my normal
life here at home wear that many
different types of jewelry and get in a
given week so I've really gotten better
about you know pick one or two fun pairs
of earrings a pair of studs to wear to
the airport maybe a dainty necklace and
a statement necklace and maybe one to
two bracelets and if it can't fit in one
of these bags it doesn't go because
these are just so simple again they
don't take up much room you can even
throw in your makeup bag if you wanted
you know but that way I'm kind of
limited I used to bring like little
travels jewelry boxes and truck but it
was giving me too much room to fill up
and it really it was just more than I
ever needed and that's just less stuff
that you need to keep track of when
you're unpacking maybe in a hotel room
you know I used to have so much then I'm
going on and I'm like got jewelry
everywhere it just wasn't worth it so
totally keep these kinds of things I
always travel with jewelry but a very
limited amount the 10 thing and this is
again very specific I always bring a
setting spray you know there are things
that I obviously always bring of course
I'm gonna bring concealer and a
foundation and SPF and those kinds of
things but this is something that I used
to not worry about making room for in my
liquids bag but I have recently this is
just one I have right in front of me
this is the mac fix+ into travel size
but really anything they have drugstore
ones and travel size you'd be amazed
what you can find in travel size
especially if you look online you'd be
really amazed but the reason I it's that
important that I would include it in my
top ten things I would travel with is
because you know when you've traveled
and you're using a mirror you're not
used to and you end up looking in
natural light you're like oh my gosh my
skin looks crepey and dry and gross this
kind of helps any kind of setting spray
because when you spray it all over
especially actually the mac fix+ and
this is cheaper than you'd think
I'll see if I can find this travel size
to link because I want to say it was
like eight to ten dollars it wasn't as
bad as you'd think and this is lasting
me forever
you know but I'll spray it all over I
sprayed it on today because I felt like
my under eyes were looking kind of dry
and crepey so I sprayed it all over and
it just helps your all of your makeup
your powder your foundation everything
melt together I really think it does and
not only that but it's also refreshing
if you get off of a flight or maybe
you're halfway through the day and
there's like I need to refresh my makeup
just spraying that on just completely
refreshes it it kind of cools you it
wakes you up so it's one of those random
travel things that it's totally worth
having room for in your liquids bag
because it's really I've used it way
more than I ever thought I would when I
travel and frankly I feel like I use
setting spray more when I travel than I
do when I'm at home so those are the top
10 items I always travel with let me
know down below what your favorite items
to travel with are even whether it's a
specific product or maybe it's just kind
of a general category of things that
you're like oh my gosh I always bring
this I'd love to know I know a lot of
you guys would love to know as well so
definitely mention that down in the
comments and we can get a conversation
going about our favorite travel items I
love to travel do you guys love to draw
I just I love it I think what's weird
and I wonder if anyone else the same I
like preparing for travel almost more
than the travel itself well not more
than but I love like these days before
we travel where I'm like okay what
makeup I get what lipstick I'm gonna
bring what you know and just being very
particular because again I used to
really over pack I used to bring three
to four lipsticks and three lip liners
I'm like again in a given week I never
wear that much lipstick or lip liner so
I've gotten so much better about
bringing one lipstick one lipgloss you
know and being very particular and it
almost makes the travel more fun because
you're forced to use this kind of
curated collection of products that
you've curated for yourself you know
what I mean and I just think that's so
fun so anyway let me know what your
favorite travel items are below
