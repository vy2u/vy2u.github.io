share with you my favorite brushes I
don't have I ever even like done one of
these videos I don't know why are my
hands so high in the air I don't know
that I've ever even done one of these
videos and I have been doing making
videos for years so I'm like well it's
about time Jess I know I've done like
where I've talked about specific brush
lines maybe I've done at least one I'm
gonna search and see if I can find an
old Jessie video of me talking about my
favorite brushes actually I'd be
interested to rewatch that and see like
do I still have any of those brushes or
have I repurchase you know etc cuz if
it's super old I probably should replace
the brushes okay I'm gonna be really
real with you guys most of these brushes
are dirty because I use them every day
and I thought about cleaning them and
I'm like I really want to do this video
tonight and I don't know that you know
we don't have to try - hello I have a
ten thousand excuses they're just dirty
sorry but I have so many have so many I
brushes face brushes I have some sponges
and tools different things to talk about
but these are like when I pull out I
have I have a drawer full of makeup
brushes and out of all of that out of
the brushes I have on my vanity and the
brushes I have in my bathroom and my
little area of dirty brushes that really
need to be cleaned I pulled out my
favorites and so there's under 20 I
tried to get it to like ten please and
it's like 20 but these are brushes that
I absolutely adore they like change the
makeup game for me in one way or another
and I would I would if I lost it I would
buy them again so let's go ahead and get
into it let's talk I brush is first so I
have one from ELF that I have like three
of now because they're so cheap these
are the this is the elf crease brush
these are around $3 this is not a big
fluffy crease brush this is just a
little bit more detailed so you can
really get in like if you want to of
course they did a really like boring I
love today but if you really want to get
in the crease or even the outer corner
you can get so detailed and precise but
it's not so dense that it's like hard to
move if that makes any sense
it's just fluffy enough that you can
like
kind of buff a color out oh my gosh I'm
just obsessed with this brush and it was
the first one I ever had this size and
it helped me do so many new eye looks
that I wasn't able to do with the
brushes I had before and I think it's
because it's fluffy but precise it's the
perfect mix again I won't like all of
these brushes I mentioned below in the
order I mention them but I love this
brush I own like three of the exact same
one another one from ELF just while I'm
on that train
this is there I don't move nothing it's
called I'll find it below but I always
use this brush it's like synthetic and
it's flat and kind of rounded I use this
for my brow bone every single day I used
it today because it's just the perfect
shape to perfectly get under there and
because it's synthetic it can really
pack on like if you really want a
shimmery brow bone if you really want a
really defined brow bone with you know
maybe a matte shade it's so good at that
it cleans so well I've had this for
freaking ever it feels like and I adore
it I probably should buy a second one
cuz when it's dirty and I like really
need to clean it I really miss it
because I don't have another brush that
does that for me
one from Mac I think this is the only
Mac brush that I'm mentioning this is
their 260 again I'll link it below I
literally put clear nail polish over it
because it was starting to wear off and
I didn't want it to and even that is
wearing off this is an eyeliner brush
this eyeliner brush changed eyeliner for
me forever I love using gel and cream
liners every single day I'm wearing one
today as well because I like to layer it
and then put liquid liner on top that's
just the way I roll and this is so well
angled and so so thin because the
problem I found with a lot of liner
brushes is that they're not thin enough
this way and so then it's you know I do
like a thick line on top but it would
get too thick and then I'm a crap and
you can't I mean at a certain point you
can't fix it you just got it even it out
and then I've got like a thick line
that's going all over my crease anyway
this is so amazing now again I really do
need to repurchase this because it's
definitely getting old but it's
withstood so many washes it does such a
great job because the angle you can
totally do a wing with it if you want I
don't do it anymore with this just
because I find it easier with the liquid
liner to just go
we do it I'm just faster that way but I
love this liner brush I have one from
Sedona lace this is their EB 21 I
freaking love this brush it's really
really small and thin but it's still
kind of fluffy I love it for doing my
lower lash line
oh you usually only do the outer kind of
half ish of my eye and it's just so good
it's great like if it were if there was
nothing on it you could use it to smudge
a color out if you want you can use it
to apply powder it's just thick enough
that it looks a little smudgy it doesn't
look like a precise line because I
typically don't want a precise line it's
perfect and I've never again I don't
have any other brushes that are exactly
like this I have some that are similar
but this is the best one for that if -
from Del am tools this is their golden
triangle line I have the whole line I
honestly am really really enjoying it
but these are the two that like really
stood out to me that I'm like oh my gosh
these are amazing so this one I use
everyday this is their tapered blending
in 785 this is a fluffy crease brush so
today I used it just to blend kind of
this lighter kind of peach shade all
throughout my crease then the look is
done I mean it's it's so soft it washes
so well my thing is I've gone through so
many brushes like this and there are a
lot out there like this but I've washed
them so many times like I have a sigma
one that's like from way back in the day
I'm like it's time to throw it out it's
so just in tatters you know what I mean
like the when you know you're brunt you
know your brushes are bad when they're
like facing ten different directions and
so then it can't do its job well and
those are just a little bit rougher this
is so so soft and they're called Golden
Triangle because the brush is actually
like a triangular prism kind of a shape
it's just a little bit easier to hold
this is the same line but it's their 783
small tapered blending this is similar
to that elf one I mentioned but it's a
little bit bigger but I really like it
for like outer V kind of stuff there's
actually a little shadow on this I'm
actually darkening this up without
meaning to I love this brush I love it
so much again it's so soft it washes so
well the shape of it is so nice for that
outer v i these are like my whole
Crale i Rush's I love them so much all
right let's talk about face brushes I
have two from it cosmetics I'm gonna
mention this is their heavenly luxe luxe
angled radiance number ten brush I I
think it supposed to be like for
highlight and I use it a couple
different ways I actually really like
this for foundation just going to town
I'll use it for concealer because these
are so soft and there's something about
them that makes blending those kinds of
cream base products so well again they
clean really well they hold their shape
beautifully after many many washes so I
really fell in love with this and then I
was sent this and it's their heavenly
loves complexion perfection but it's in
number seven I typically get annoyed
with dual ended brush it's cuz I'm like
I can't I can put it in a cup but then
this brush is just like on the bottom
and you know I just don't like that but
this is amazing did I end up traveling
with this on our last trip I might have
so I'll use this side for foundation and
it works so beautifully I'll use it for
powder foundation you can use it for so
much but then the other side is so good
at concealing at concealer it'll blend
it so so seamlessly and you know you I
don't usually go for this small of a
brush for concealer but there's
something about this one especially
right there like where you've got all of
your you know me I've got all my
crinkles also play a little under-eye
you know fine lines it does such a good
job of blending in the area I love this
brush it's super dirty I probably
shouldn't be rubbing it all over my face
so I need to clean it but I both of
these brushes this heavenly luxe line
they're expensive but they're so so good
but if I were to recommend one of the
two I'd recommend this one because I
feel like this does the same thing this
one does but then you get the bonus of
the concealer brush that I love this is
another kind of one I'm mentioning
together this is the RT sovel number
seven brush I really do adore this
however there's another one on Amazon
that I adore just as much it's just much
bigger it's from Laguna get out of stock
in stock and then sometimes it's not
there at all so I don't recommend it all
the time that's why I wanted
because the artiste one is amazing it's
so expensive you just use it it pushes
out your foundation so seamlessly
there's so many dupes out there though
but this is the best soup I've tried so
hopefully it's in stock on Amazon so
I'll link it if I can but it is much
bigger I did a comparison video of these
two but it's just as soft I mean I'm
telling you it's like the same quality
I'm just like this is like 12 bucks
versus like I don't know 40 50 60 bucks
from that same brand the artiste brand
this is their palm brush mini I love
this stuff I've been using it for
concealer now I know it's gigantic and
you're probably Ken what like why would
you it's so good for that
it smells like coffee because one
morning I need to clean this one morning
I accidentally dropped two in my coffee
mug getting ready and I think I was like
snapping at the time so a lot of you
guys know about it but still need to
clean it that's pretty disgusting but
it's it's so good for that there's a
little like fingerprint for you to put
your finger to do it you could do it the
other way around you could use I think
the intent is you can use it for
foundation and things like that but I
just really like it for concealer all
right speaking of concealer I really
like this again I don't know if these
are even still sold the diva Beauty so3
mini angled this is dirty as well again
it's a small size but it's so good at
blending out concealer so quickly it
cleans really well I've had this for
years and every time I clean it it's
like its brand new no weird you know
bristles sticking out in weird
directions it is so so good and this
whole brand has amazing brushes I talked
about them a lot early on when I first
started my channel and I still use a lot
of those brushes so I hope they're still
in business next is from Sedona lace
this is their FBO 7 again an amazing
foundation brush here's the thing though
this is one of those brushes that is so
soft and so seamless at blending I'll
grab this and I'll just blend everything
with it I'll blend this then I'll put
concealer on I'll use that it somehow
even though it's a bigger brush it gets
into those corners so well just brush I
love so much I like forgot about it and
I rediscovered it in my collection like
a month ago and I was like I forgot
about how much I love a brush and I was
so excited to use it again and I use
that many men
many mornings so love this as well I do
I think this blends things quicker than
it cosmetics one does they're a very
different feel you know this is more of
a flattop
a little more synthetic feeling this one
feels a little more natural and it's a
little more rounded okay but speaking of
it's eight cosmetics this I don't have
the name so I'm gonna try to find it
online this is my favorite blush brush
of all time I like my blush to kind of
go back into that area this is the
perfect perfect brush like when it's
dirty I'm like dang it and I'll try
using other brushes and then it never
looks as seamless and as even as it does
when I get to use my very favorite it
cosmetics blush brush it's again I've
had it for years and I if I ever lost it
I would try to repurchase it it's so
good now there are other companies that
make blush brushes similar ly but
there's something about this one that it
just always looks more seamless another
favorite is the Anastasia 823
highlighting brush
it's just that perfect size for throwing
highlighter on but Milani makes a dupe
and it's like dead-on it's like the
exact same and it's much much cheaper
and actually in the lobby one's much
much softer you can't tell the
difference when you use them so I love
both I love the shape of both of these
but I discovered that Anasazi one first
fell in love with it then bought the
Milani one and I was like oh my gosh so
they're both so good but you can totally
save the money the Milani one's even
softer and it does the exact same thing
but I like these because on the kind of
flat side you can get the highlighter on
it and just just use that flat side to
get it where you want it to be more
vibrant and it really does a great job
at that last I'm gonna mention brush
wise then I have some tools and stuff
and sponges this is the Luxy brush 522
tapered highlighter I have like two of
these in two different handle shades
this is just the fluffiest best brush
this brand came out of nowhere like I
got some of their brushes in boxycharm
gypsies things like that over the years
and their brushes are so soft they
always have really cute handles like
this is like pink the other one I have
is like a periwinkle so beautiful you
can use it for highlighter I've used it
for blush abused if a bronzer I've used
it I've used it so many different ways
I've even used it to blend out concealer
it there's such
versatile brushes it's so funny that
they call it a highlighter brush because
that's totally how you could use it but
it's so universal and they're so soft
they wash really well and I'm just like
I really really like them before I talk
about my sponges the Clarisonic
foundation brush head I really I don't
use for foundation I've discovered that
it's okay for that but it tickles my
nose too much I just can't handle it I
use it you turn it on and vibrates and
you could take this off and put on a
cleansing brush head to it you know but
this is the foundation one and I use it
just for bronzer I really do cream
bronzer mostly I used it for powder
bronzer today I just really really liked
it now do you need to spend the money
for that no but if you already have a
Clarisonic try the foundation brush yet
I think you'll be amazed I really really
have been liking it that way I've used
it a lot for cream bronzer just to get
it there cuz it blends it so seamlessly
it just looks airbrush and it's so quick
my favourite sponges L'Oreal the pink
L'Oreal sponges are my number one period
now I feel like it's so hit or miss
because I'll buy one at the store and
it'll be like dead-on exactly their love
and then I'll buy another one online or
at a store and then it's not as good so
I don't know what's going on
but I own like four of these and I just
love them again these are dirty they're
the best brushes out there they get nice
and squishy but they actually blend the
foundation so seamlessly even when put
up against like the Beauty Blender I
still like the L'Oreal ones better and
they're way cheaper
I do feel however the sponges are very
personal and you know someone will love
a sponge and then like I'll be like oh I
didn't like that one people are really
it's a very personal thing I think we
like different looks we like different
feels and so the l'oreal lore'l what
happens to my favorite now a close
second is the Laura
the flower Beauty sponge this one's very
dirty I need to get another one these
get so big and they're the softest
sponge you've ever used I mean if you've
never had one of these and wet it you'd
be amazed it's nothing like any other
sponge you have they get humongous and
crazy soft and squishy but they do a
beautiful job as well so I really really
like this and then the other one I just
don't happen to
in front of me hold on I think I have
one right here what I use today is just
a standard beauty blender I do really
like these I bought the black ones over
the years I bought the nude ones the
pink ones I feel like the pink ones work
better and I don't know if I'm just in
my head but the black one and the nude
one I feel like they didn't get as big
or as squishy
I don't know so I've gone back this is
an old one it's actually starting to rip
but I just the beauty blender really is
good but I still like the L'Oreal one
better than the beauty blender but I
like them all so those are all of my
favorite brushes and makeup applicators
if you enjoyed this kind of a video
definitely give it a thumbs up to let me
know and other than that I would love to
know what are your Holy Grail brushes
sponges things that maybe I haven't
tried I'd love to try them and other
than that I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
