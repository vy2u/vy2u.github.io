gonna talk about my three favorite
lipsticks now I do have two that are way
more expensive and then one that is
cheaper and they're all really good so
let's go ahead and get into it my first
favorite is from NYX so this is the
cheaper option it's the NYX matte
lipstick and it's in the shade whipped
caviar so let me just show you a swatch
so these are a matte lipstick formula so
they are be a little bit more drying so
while I love this shade in particular I
do feel like generally you want to make
sure that your lips are well moisturized
and you might even consider topping them
with a lip gloss because I do think they
look better that way my next favorite is
from Marc Jacobs and it is the Lamarck
lip creams so the packaging is really
nice and I have three shades to show you
so the first shade is Sonic truth and
this one is a lot lighter of a color and
so if you have really pigmented lips
like me this one's right on the verge of
you know it makes your lips look better
but it's a little light my next shade is
Oh Miley and this is the fast it is a
bright red
look at that pigmentation oh my gosh
bought it in Paris on our honeymoon so
it's it's a special color
me next one is called infamous and this
one's kind of in between it's like a
spicy color and again the formula of
these is so creamy it stays on really
well definitely wear lip liner with
those brighter colors just to keep the
look clean
my last favorite lipstick formula is
from NARS and it is their audacious
lipstick I have the shade Raquel and
again this one's a little lighter but I
do really like it I'm interested to buy
more shades from this range because
these are incredibly creamy gorgeous on
the lips and I just want more shades
like maybe a berry tone did you think
that would look really nice on my lips
so those are my top 3 favorite lipsticks
