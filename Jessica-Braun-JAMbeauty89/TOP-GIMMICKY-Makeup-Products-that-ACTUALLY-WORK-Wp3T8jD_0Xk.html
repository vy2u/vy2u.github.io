else like hold I always do my thumbnails
before I like start the video and so I'm
like you know before and I hold my
breath
does anyone else hold their breath when
they're taking photos but I'm always out
of breath and I serve videos cuz I
always started that way and I'm like and
I just like hold my breath like why why
do we do that does anyone else if I just
crazy I can't be the only one okay so
today we are going to talk about
products that I thought were a little
bit gimmicky and by gimmicky I mean
there was something about them that I
was like oh that's kind of this new
fresh idea but does it really work you
know that kind of a product so I have
one two three four five six here that
actually surprised me we're actually
really good and they have most of them
have become staples in my collection I
am wearing five of the six products on
my face today so I will show you me
applying them as I talk about them for
each product so you can see what they
look like on my actual face so let's
start with this product here now this is
not the only brand to come out with this
kind of a product I'm very well aware of
that but the product itself is still
kind of gimmicky and this is the butter
LONDON glaze and eye glosses a lot of
you guys have asked you know how do you
apply this what does this look like on
so today I'm gonna show you but I'm
wearing on my eyelid today I have no
other shimmer on my eyelid but this and
I have the shade icing it's this
gorgeous kind of bronze II almost rose
gold like color there's a lot of glitter
and shimmer to it but there's no fallout
there's no glitter fallout like not even
a single freaking speck it's crazy so it
looks like pudding and when you tap it
it's just kind of weird but I'll show
you me applying it now I just dip my
finger in it I tap it onto my eyelid try
to get it all the way up into the crease
which I've got a lot of lid space and so
sometimes I forget to go all the way up
but it's like for me it really does make
a difference when I do and when I don't
so then I'll just grab a smaller crease
brush and I'll just kind of fluff that
into the crease so that it doesn't look
like a you know like a defined line I
want it to be a little bit more soft and
then of course I'll go away
with whatever palette and maybe do some
other colors in the crease like I did
today and if you're curious reaching
into my everyday makeup during here I am
trying out the Too Faced natural matte
and so if you're just curious how I
finished off the look I used this darker
Brown sexpert in the outer corner and a
little bit of unnatural to just kind of
blend it all together that's it I really
didn't do oh I might have used less as
more a little bit of that to kind of
blend as well I think I did but other
than that that's it usually I put stuff
on my lower lash line
I didn't today just because I feel like
this shimmer is so pretty it didn't need
much else you know but that palette by
the way I'm still trying out but I do
like it I think it blends really well
and I so far the looks I've done with it
have looked very nice anywho so this eye
product stays on all day for me it
doesn't crease now I'd be curious to
hear from you guys I don't have very
oily eyelid so if you do and you've
tried these butter LONDON glazing
glosses let us know below
like how does it wear on your eyelids if
you have oily eyelids have you found a
primer that works really well with these
kinds of products like for me my
favorite primer sorry I keep reaching
back but I want to show you is my Ulta
my Ulta matte eye primer and nude I just
put that all over and that seems to hold
onto it pretty darn well but again I
don't have super super oily eyelids but
I'll link this below it's like 5 bucks
and it is amazing so kind of seeing
gimmicky cuz of this pudding texture but
it's actually really nice really long
wearing and just beautiful they have
other colors as well but I purged my
collection and really only kept a couple
things and this is the only shade I kept
and I freaking love it so many people
made fun of this products I'm like don't
make fun of it I love it it's the
benefit hoola quickie contour stick now
in all fairness I was probably on the
other side of things and I was like mmm
first of all it looks like a hot dog
which is the funniest I didn't come up
with that someone else I heard someone
else say that and I laughed so hard
because I'd never realized it literally
looks like a hot dog more like a Vienna
sausage anyway when I was a kid my mom
would always buy Vienna saw
from all these and I would like go into
the pantry and be like it might eat all
the Vienna sausage oh my gosh
I haven't had those in so long I'm sure
they're so unhealthy for you
anywho I just apply a little bit of this
before I powder my face I'll apply a
little bit to kind of my contour areas
if you will
/ really bronzer areas because this
really is more of a bronzer tone but for
me since I'm not doing extreme anything
I'm not doing extreme bronzing or
contouring I kind of use it as both
because it doesn't really matter so I'll
use a wet sponge to kind of blend it in
just by tapping it into it and it ends
up looking so natural and pretty and I
haven't you know I'll use my light cream
bronzers like my really expensive so
late and a Chanel again I might as well
show you this and I really do like this
stuff it's this really expensive cream
bronzer where you know I'll get my wet
sponge dip it into it and apply it and
that looks beautiful too but this is
even quicker and I feel like it blends a
little bit easier and then if you top it
with like if you really wanted to amp it
up you could top it with a powder
bronzer or powder contour whatever and
it's gonna set even longer but I don't
really feel the need to I feel like it
wears really well and naturally
throughout the day and that's what I
want I don't for me dry skin I don't
really want to add a lot more powder to
my face so I'm all about the cream
products and that's been a learning
curve for me because for the longest
time I was just intimidated by them but
really I just learned that your best
friend is your sponge and it can do
everything it can do absolutely
everything so kind of seems gimmicky cuz
it's like oh yeah benefits coming out
I guess the product itself is not super
gimmicky it's just that people like Dino
do you really need it is it really any
good I don't know but I freaking loved
it I guess now that I'm like talking
about I'm like I guess that's not that
gimmicky but oh well forgive me by the
way my I bought this Starbucks Disney
parks cup the last time we were in
Disney World for our babymoon in like
January and so when I bought it
you just before that it doesn't matter
anyway I'm sad cuz I drop it all the
time but I
the other day and there's like a big ol
crack and I'm like now you're garbage
I'm just kidding you're not garbage I'll
still use you all right
next product is extremely hyped up right
now and very gimmicky in my opinion
except for also it's incredible
so this is the Becca Hydra mist set and
fresh powder it's like um it's a high
percentage actual water and yet it's a
powder it's very weird you guys I
thought it'd be oh it's just a powder
that maybe has some maybe has some stuff
in it that makes it hydrating but it's
still just a powder it's seven left
outer II I've never in my life if you
saw my snap when I originally snapped
about this when I first got it I was
like because I didn't know what to say
I've never tried anything like this so
you have to open this which is not that
crazy for a powder and there's this mesh
screen but here's the thing you touch
the powder and the powder itself is cold
it's cold and when you put it on your
face whether you're using like a brush
or a sponge it's cold I've never it's
the weirdest thing very applied it today
is I used my little sponge from L'Oreal
and I got some of the powder on it and I
just set my under eye it does darken
your under eye for me a lot of the
concealers I have are a little too light
for my under eye anyway and so it
doesn't like I'm wearing it today and I
don't feel like my under eyes look
overly dark by any means so for me it
almost kind of tones it down in a way
that makes it look more natural and yet
it sets it completely does this look
crepey or does it make my dry skin look
drier no does it make my dry skin look
like amazingly hydrated no it doesn't do
that either that would be insanely
amazing but no but is this something
that I like using on my under eye yes
and all over I think I like it on my
under eye better than all over my face
but even still this is that powder that
I want to go to when I just look up
maybe I like one
crazy on the glowy primers and the glowy
foundation and everything and I'm just
looking just straight-up greasy this is
the powder I'll grab for and just dust
it on my like forehead and it soaks up
just the right amount where I can still
look like I'm lit from within but I
don't look like oh she used way too much
glowy product so for that it has a
secure place in my curated collection
because I'm finding that I'm reaching
for it more and more for that reason
because I do I'd much rather be glowy
and so I end up going crazy and then
I'll like go to my bathroom and look I'm
good oh my gosh
geez Jessica you look crazy and so then
I'll run back grab this dust some on and
it's the perfect amount of modification
I really was impressed with this stuff
it is bizarre if you can go into a store
and feel it see if you like it I mean
get a little on your finger maybe and
tap it on it's unlike anything I've ever
tried in my entire life but I do like it
another product that I thought would be
gimmicky and oh my goodness I love it
I'm wearing it today this is the
Maybelline lasting drama matte lacquer
eyeliner so I bought it on a whim on my
I don't know like my target haul I think
where I took you guys along with me I
can link it below where I took you guys
along with me while I shopped at Target
so it's this squeezy - and you squeeze
and the product comes up into this
little tiny reservoir and it's got a
little lip around it so it's not like
getting all over in fact it's been
really surprisingly easy to keep this
clean you just have to wipe it off once
you're done with it and then it's it's
actually been really nice so then I'll
just grab any liner brush that I love so
I you know grab one and I apply it as if
it's kind of a cream gel liner now it
does it's certainly more liquid like but
it's a little bit thicker than just a
liquid liner I mean it's not just it's
kind of like the consistency of
chocolate syrup
now that sounds crazy but it kind of is
it's like a liquid but a little bit
thicker but when you're using it with a
liner brush already used to using it's
so easy to quickly get a black line it
is very black it stays all day long it
definitely dries so much so that I do
have to be really conscious when I put
it on - like before I put on my mascara
I need to brush
with a lash comb because right at the
base of the lash where this liner dries
it'll hold lashes together does that
make sense so I'll brush through it
really quickly before I put on my
mascara and it's just fine but it is
something that because it does just dry
down once it's done you do have to be
cognizant of that but stuff is amazing
like it's easier to use I think then
like a pot of gel liner
he's just easier to maneuver is really
what it is so if you're more of a
beginner you might want to give it a try
this is the one I'm not wearing today
because well they're both liners this is
the essence cushion liner this is
literally a cushion drenched in liquid
liner so it is more liquid than the
Maybelline one is I think if I were
choosing between the two I do think I
like this Maybelline one better again
it's easier to maneuver to maneuver
that's a good breeze anyway so then I'll
grab my liner brush and dip it in and I
can you know do a wing with it because
it is really more like a liquid liner
however it dries out the brush you use
so unless you straight-up full-on wash
your brush right after you use it like
all usually every morning I have my
little washcloth for the day and I will
usually just kind of wipe off the brush
on there and then it's fine for the next
day and then I you know spot clean it
throughout anyway umm but with this I
mean even when you do that it's still
hardened to the brush so I don't know
I'm reaching for it so much less now
that I discovered this Maybelline one
because I don't feel like messing with
having to fully wash my brush every time
I use it does that make sense so I think
it's not gimmicky it's really actually
fantastic it's a very black stays on all
day but you do have to just be aware of
that that is something to think about
this is a product that I guess is less
gimmicky and more just
it was super hyped up and no one that I
had seen had really done this yet and it
was this RMS beauty living Luminizer now
they have two other shades have like a
rose gold one and then they have another
one that's called
master mixer that's just a little bit
more golden tone this one's like white
but what it is is it's a highlighter and
it's cream but it's a very thin layer
very translucent more like a gloss but
it dry Sun on your face and stays and so
I'd originally I've told this story
before on my channel but I'd originally
heard about it from like some model was
like oh yeah for my like effortless
beauty I'm dropping it for my effortless
beauty um I just like dab a little tiny
bit of concealer and then I'm not making
fun of them it's more jealousy that like
I wish I looked that beautiful after
just going tap tap tap tap and then just
like walking out the door anyway so with
this stuff you know she would just dab
and then just like tap it here and it
looks spectacular well the thing is it
really does look spectacular and so that
to me is why I was like this seems
gimmicky like it's just this weird clear
gloss like there's no way it stays on
your skin all day
it totally does I have it on today I'll
put it on the tip of my nose and what's
amazing about it is there's no glitter
or shimmer it really is kind of like a
glassy youthful look it's the craziest
thing now I did have master mixer and I
need to clean this off I did have master
mixer the different shade and I ended up
getting rid of it because this really
even though it's like whoa that's white
it really is appropriate for my skin
tone so you'll have to look at them and
decide if you were think about buying it
what would be appropriate this is gonna
last me forever however it says 12
months so I need to make sure I'm using
this like crazy but I really I really do
like it you can also if you're not
comfortable doing your finger you could
use a clean sponge and tap it that way
that is probably the most foolproof way
to apply it I didn't do it that way
today but what I did notice today is
when I applied it I literally had a
strip and I had to like take a second to
kind of blend it in but when I apply it
just with my sponge to those areas that
ends up looking really flawless so
that's just something again to think
about those were very thorough
explanations I'm realizing I only talked
about six products but that was like
kind of a long video for that so I hope
you enjoyed this style of video if you
did let me know by giving a thumbs up
and I can work towards maybe exploring
some more gimmicky product
whether they're worth it or not and
other than that I hope you'll subscribe
and tap that notification bell so you
get notified when I upload new videos
and I'll see you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
