doing another unboxing of one of my new
favorite subscription boxes which is
called stitch fix you don't know what's
it fixes it's basically a subscription
box for clothing and they also do shoes
I don't know that they do handbags I
thought they did but I keep requesting
one and not getting one so I'm like I
don't know like maybe they don't do it
but it's basically one of those services
where when you sign up for your account
you can pick like alright I like these
kinds of clothes but not these they show
you pictures you kind of rank what you
like what you don't like and then you
can give every single piece of
information about your size you know do
you like form-fitted do you like you
know kind of fitted you like loose do
you like baggy all those kinds of things
and they will really tailor your box
based on what you actually like and also
you can send them a message saying hey
to your specific stylist I really need a
new pair of black flats this month which
is actually what I told them I also said
I needed a pair of khaki type work pants
like dress pants and I also said I
wanted a black cardigan so some of these
things are in here I'm going to show you
they really do actually listen to what
you say you can create a Pinterest board
as well called stitch fix and Link it to
your account so then they can also see
like oh they really like floral little
bomber jackets which is what I'm
planning on asking for in my next box I
also want I just watched the second Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel the other day with
Tyler and in it at the very end the
bride I don't remember the character's
name she was wearing this light light
pink fitted blazer and I was like oh my
gosh that is the cutest thing I've ever
seen in my life so I want to ask for
something specific I want to see if I
can get a screenshot like sent it to him
what can you find this I want this
anyway Wow let's go ahead and get into
what I got in the box I'm also gonna do
a try on with this so you'll see them on
me as I'm talking about them I know I
didn't do that in the first video and a
lot of you guys asked so let's start
first thing in here are these shoes now
I had asked for black flats and these
are so flippin cute now I kind of have
wide feet so these don't fit me
awesomely so since you don't have to
accept everything in your box you could
get none of it you could get one thing
whatever you this is probably something
I'll send back and I think in my reasons
why I don't want it I'm going to tell
her my feet are a little bit
than this it's just not comfortable but
these are so cute and what I like is I
asked for a pair of black flats but I
kind of liked that she sent me something
with a little bit more style you know
just a kind of funky up funk funk up an
outfit that doesn't really make any
sense
I'm so not cool I turned 27 this year
and I'm like am I like starting to not
be cool at all like I'll say things and
my students would be like like oh my
gosh I'm like already an old lady
whatever anyway so these are really
really cute they're just not quite right
for me the rest of them are close so one
of these this is a surprise one I love
blouses like this and it's mint green
which I also love and it has these
little like birdies on it and it just
kind of got a three-quarter length
sleeve that's just kind of flowy the
whole thing is really flowy and I just
think it is so comfortable it's the same
brand I loved from last month that was
my yellow tank it's from a brand called
Pixley and I just apparently I really
like the brand because this is the
second thing I've got for them that I
love I actually already wore this so I
need to wash it
another thing about stitch fix that I
like is you can get them as often as you
want or not so like I'm on the plan
where I schedule when I want it so I
could go a year and then suddenly say
okay I want one in schedule one so you
don't have to feel obligated every month
to cancel it's kind of one of those
things where you're doing it on your own
time so I could get one this month and
then wait a few months and say okay I'm
ready for another one or I have enough
money maybe to do another one I really
went into the into detail with pricing
and everything in that first video I'll
link and I show you kind of literally on
the screen how the website actually
works so if you're really interested in
the details of it I'll link that first
video so the next thing is what I asked
for a black cardigan but again they
didn't just send a plain black cardigan
they sent one that has a little bit of
style I told her I wanted it to be
somewhat fitted but it has this little
lace kind of crocheted detail that just
makes it so cute I wear black cardigans
all the time and I recently got rid of
the one I had
it was just old and it was like faded so
I was so excited to have another one of
these they're the best for work just
love throwing them on top of a really
cute patterned like tank top or
something like that they're just perfect
for that it's like the biggest staple in
my wardrobe ever next thing was another
surprise item this is a sweater but it's
like a thin kind of spring white sweater
and I love the color again it's like
that light pink in the Blazer that I
want and so it's like a turtleneck
that's like got that loose neck but it
has this little hole in the back
it's so cute it almost looks like a faux
scarf on from the back it looks so
beautiful this is one of those things
that I don't think I ever would have
bought for myself but I ended up loving
so that's what I've kind of liked about
this so far is that I feel like I'm
getting outfits added to my wardrobe
that I wouldn't have necessarily seen
and said oh I'm gonna love that but I
tried them on and I was like oh my gosh
I really do it's just kind of making me
just kind of helping me blossom into my
style the last thing in here there's
always five items are these pants now I
had asked for a pair of like khaki type
pants but I did specifically say I like
it to be a little bit deeper of a color
whether it's like a deeper tan color or
whatever so I love the color of these
the fit just wasn't right it fits really
well in the hip and they're like my mint
ones from last month that I loved the
mint skinny pants but they're just a
little bit too baggy from the knee down
where they're kind of a relaxed fit
which look really cute on some people
but it doesn't look right with my frame
so it either needs to like flare out a
little bit or it needs to be pretty darn
fitted or else I just look crazy because
I have really long legs and a short
torso I just got kind of a weird body
sight but I really love the color though
so again this is another thing I'll send
back but I am gonna keep the three tops
I'm gonna send back the shoes cuz of the
fit and these because of the fit I love
this service if you can't tell like I
think I'm kind of getting to that point
where I'm so I love makeup subscription
boxes and I do and I continue to do them
every month because I do love them but
you know in my everyday life I don't
need more makeup
I need more you know I want more clothes
that I can wear to
work that are really practical I don't
need anymore eyeshadow palettes I don't
need anymore blushes that part of me is
for my channel but for this it's awesome
for my real-life teens that make sense
out of them I think it makes sense so if
you're interested in this or you're
still not sure definitely check out my
first video on this service other than
that I hope that you'll subscribe and
become a part of our little family here
on YouTube and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
