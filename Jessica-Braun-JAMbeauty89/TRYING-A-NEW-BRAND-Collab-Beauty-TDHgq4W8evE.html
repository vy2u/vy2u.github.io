with me today and we are going to do a
kind of Tryon version of a video where
I'm going to try a bunch of videos nope
try a bunch of makeup on for the first
time as I told you guys in the past I'm
not a huge fan of first impressions
videos however I don't mind them if
they're followed up maybe a month or two
later with like a follow up so that way
you know you guys can see how these
perform now but then after a month or
two I can let you know like hey after
trying these for a lot longer hear my
thoughts you know I ended up still
loving this and I didn't like you know
things like that
so that is kind of my goal on my channel
with these kinds of videos so today I'm
going to be talking about collab I don't
know if it's collab or collab and the
reason I say that is because they
separate the let me just pull one of the
products they separate the Co L from the
lab and the idea is and this is why I'm
really excited to do this the idea is
that it's a bunch of youtubers and
influencers here actually Savage is the
first youtuber I ever watched ever so
that's cool coffee break with Danny I
freaking love who else do i watch here I
sometimes watch Lizzie and I sometimes
watch X bar catch and the other people I
I didn't even know about yet so I'm kind
of excited to check out their channels
cuz always looking for fresh new
channels I just spit everywhere I tell
my students all the time like I'm so
sorry I will spit on you this year and
it won't be on purpose I promise anyway
why would it be on purpose so they all
collab to help kind of come up with
these products and colors and formulas
and all of those things and so they sent
a bunch of them over the brand did and
I'm excited it's funny because I'd
honestly forgotten about this launch
I had bought I just spit again guys I
had been excited about this launch when
I first heard about it and I added a
bunch of stuff to my cart because they
sell out at Sally Beauty Supply and I
never pulled the trigger and bought it
and months pass and I keep like in the
back of my head I'm like oh I still want
to order some stuff from collab or
collab whatever and I never had so then
these shut up my doorstep my perfect so
we're gonna try it out completely
non-biased
as I always am because I mean the
reality is if a brand doesn't want to
send me things because I'm talking
negatively
about a product then that says a lot
more about them than it does about me so
alright sorry I'm like trying to figure
out what also I've already put on some
face makeup like I've already got
concealer BB cream powder on just
because and my brows just so I mean
they're enough there's nothing here to
try in that realm but the first thing I
do want to try let's just start with
like the blush so here's their blush the
packaging is really really pretty and of
course I'll have these listed and linked
below the price of their blush is 1199
it says they have six shades so this
shade that they sent is called just for
fun I like the packaging it opens
sideways a way that you might not expect
based on how the wording is I mean I
guess if you look at it this way then
it's not sideways duh totally a color
for my skintone I don't know how much
they curated these depending on who they
were sending them to or not but this is
totally like a blush I would have picked
out for myself in any line so it was
that was very very soft to swatch that's
like two or three times over the same
spot so if I just did it once that's
what it looks like I mean it's not that
different it's my kind of blush
sometimes when I have one of those like
POW kinds of blushes it's so much and I
end up looking like a clown and anyway
so they also spent their multitasking
face brush and I'm gonna use this it
says you can use it for blush bronzer
highlight whatever you want this retails
for $11.99 the it's like a matte all of
the packaging is like a matte black kind
of like NARS which I really really like
that even though they get fingerprints
eat I just like it I don't know why
anyway but it says cool app on the
handle it feels really nice there's like
it's not just a cylinder there's it's
like a geometric like they're like faces
to it if that makes any sense
feels really soft it does not feel super
I don't know there's something about it
that does feel cheaper but not like in a
super obvious way I think if you've ever
felt that you might know what I mean but
it's really really soft it's kind of
domed so let's just see how this applies
I just tapped a bunch of it off but then
I felt like it kind of tapped all of it
off it's not my favorite shape of a
for blush but I could totally see myself
using this brush for like bronzer maybe
highlight I could even see myself using
it just for face powder because I don't
need a huge brush necessarily okay I'm
really digging the shade this was easy
to apply I mean you just saw it it's
it's not too much it's not too little I
really like this again it's up my alley
because it's a it's kind of a fuss free
formula it's not anything that is really
tricky to work with you know sometimes
if like I was saying if it's too
pigmented you put it on you're like oh
my gosh just like a stripe but I felt
like this the blood the brush did a good
job applying it kind of evenly I might
need to kind of even that out of it
maybe even with some powder but and I'm
also really digging the blush so so far
so good I could see myself like I said I
I think I probably won't keep this as a
blush brush I'll probably use it more
for bronzer or even just all-over face
powder so we're gonna go in with this
eye shadow palette this is their palette
Pro eyeshadow palette in best of the day
and this one retails for $14.99 they
have four different colorways or four
different palettes so they have like
kind of on the back as I'm trying to
peel the tape off they have like little
ideas for looks you could do but these
colors in this particular one this again
this is probably one I would have picked
out for myself
very warm toned but pretty we've got
some mats over here get a light a nice
matte just kind of blending color for my
skin tone a nice crease color a deeper
color really most of these are matte the
only two shimmers are these two so let's
just watch some of these I'm curious Wow
so there's this deep brown and this kind
of light bronze oh my gosh that was way
too sure that I expected cuz you know
when you first are up your finger I'm
like it feels pretty nice but that was
like smoother than I expected
let me roll these sleeves up because I
can just foresee myself gettin making a
mess so let's go ahead and swatch the
rest of the colors just so we can know
you know are the mats as
nice and a smooth and buttery as the
shimmers yeah I think they are so
they're by the way are the ones I just
swatch let me swatch two more I mean
these are pretty nice let me get these
two lighter shades probably should have
started with that but okay so the
lighter shades they might not be the
beige might be as pigmented it's just
hard to see but that one wasn't nearly
as but again that's the one for me
personally I'm gonna be using to blend
so I don't really mind is that it's not
crazy crazy pigmented but some people
might especially since the rest of them
are a little bit more pigmented yeah I
don't know I was trying to swatch it
again it might be just as pigmented but
so far I really like it but let's
actually put it on the eyes and see how
it looks so I'm really into this I'm
just putting it on I've mentioned this
in a few videos the Catrice prime and
fine brightening eyeshadow base because
it's like it is super brightening it
cancels some stuff out it holds on the
shadow and a little bit goes a long way
clearly cuz that was already too much
and it's really cheap I want to say it's
like six or seven bucks maybe even
cheaper might even be like $4.99 at Ulta
you can order it online um it sounds
like I'm sponsored by them I'm not I
just freaking love this stuff
and I can't stop mentioning you see what
I mean by it's like super brightening
but it's not a stark stark white and
again I use stark white sometimes on my
lid but I don't always use it like all
over cuz it's a little bit too much for
me but I know some people do so you
might want something a little more white
but I'm really really loving this turret
so I'm gonna go in with the kind of
beige color here and I'm just gonna kind
of start my look by putting this
everywhere I always start with by doing
this with whatever palette I'm using
sometimes I'll even pull in like I have
a single shadow from wet-and-wild called
Brule oh it is the best it is the best
it is Larry the best beige colored
eyeshadow if you're near my skin tone to
just kind of set your whole thing so
that way no shadow gets stuck to little
sticky parts of the primer this gets rid
of all that so now I'm going to go into
the
um I'm doing a classic Jessie look I'm
just letting you know since this is the
first time I'm trying this I just want
to do a kind of an eye shadow look I'm
comfortable with because if I do
something totally outside of what I
usually do that might affect my opinion
on it when it comes to like oh I didn't
like it but I might be thinking that
because I didn't end up like in the look
I create does that make sense so I want
to do something I'm used to doing to see
how it performs with something that I
know I do all the time so I'm grabbing
that medium brown same brush and I'm
just kind of putting it in my crease and
you guys know I had someone comment on
the last video I laughed and then I
deleted it because my channel gosh darn
it
and she was like um I didn't recognize
her name like I recognize your guys's
names when you comment all the time I
really do
especially over the years um this is a
pretty color
anyway she said that was the sloppiest I
look I've ever seen anyone do on YouTube
ever you need to quit look that was so
constructive thank you
delete it's like the reality is I've
never claimed to be like a like a makeup
art and I'm sent anonymous I just you
know kind of self-taught just be really
it's more than I just like makeup
I've taken some makeup classes in the
past nothing like huge to learn basics
and like it was really more like stage
makeup but I just do everyday looks like
I am a normal person so it just made me
laugh anywho okay I want to put okay I'm
thinking about how these blended I feel
like it blend in really nicely a little
too nicely that's why I stopped for a
second like look because I'm like wait
is this like even go out but it is let
me get this shimmer on first so I'm
gonna use the pretty kind of champagne
II shimmer
ohoho and I'm just putting it straight
on the lid with my finger oh it's so
pretty
gosh this was like a good combo of just
neutral for me
neutral everyday kind of a look it's
really pretty I might throw a little
something deeper into the outer corner
maybe we'll go with this dark brown
we're
using this quad over here I know that's
so boring that I feel like my last few
looks have been really orangie here on
YouTube so I'm kind of wanting to do
maybe something I want to say cool tone
just because I'm using this like cooler
Brown it's not really a cool tone look
because the rest of its not but just
kind of putting it in this outer corner
I'm impressed you guys I mean this feels
like I'm using any $50 palette that I
own um so I'm gonna do my browbone with
that same shade I started with that kind
of beige I'm just kind of lightly
sometimes I'll even take a different
fluffy brush and get the beige color and
just kind of do it on my inner corner to
kind of blend that I learned that from
Emily Noelle and I my mind was blown
I was like holy moly how have I never
done that it works really well because
again this beige is not nearly as
pigmented let me show you the white wine
out single please this thing is the most
pigmented thing for a dollar ninety-nine
you've ever tried and this I'm actually
just going to do it so you can see this
but it kicks up a lot of powder but I
will use this to literally almost like
set my inner corner and kind of blend it
and it's just like perfect it's like a
it's almost like a concealing powder
it's crazy
oh my powder all over the place but it's
so good I don't even care I don't even
care how powder is because it's so good
at its job it's like it doesn't matter
that I mean I know that's such a like
boring look but that is the look that I
like to do but I am gonna grab a smaller
brush and I'm gonna do my lower lash I'm
at that same cool tone dark brown just
kind of mostly towards the outside and
then just a little bit inward just kind
of define that just a tinge but nothing
too crazy or fancy eyes like made a mess
of this palette um I'm liking it so far
now the next thing I wanted to try is
they have two different eyeliners one is
just their collab bold face liner
waterproof eyeliner pencil and this one
retails for $8.99 they have six shades
and this is just their black unless it's
like blackest black I think it's just
black oh it's called drama queen fat
it's black and then the other one is in
a different kind of packaging and this
is their killer Kohl self-sharpening eye
pencil they have six shades it's $9.99
and this one like it says it's self
sharpens so I want to use the black one
to be honest with you because that is
what I would use typically and that that
would be the one I would be interested
in so again you'd have to sharpen this
one but I like to kind of tight line
with it just a tinge whew
okay it glides on like really really
well
it really is pretty easy to apply I'm
one of those people that no matter how
bad it is for me I can't not pull on my
eyelid to line my eyes like I can't I
can't do it and I know I'm not alone
because so many of you guys have told me
like dude me either and then there are
those few that are like you're gonna get
wrinkles I'm like whoa I'm getting them
anyway
bring him on I don't know like I've
tried so I mean I cannot tell you how
many times but I have to pull on it just
a little bit but this is the liner that
I don't feel like I've to pull too much
because it's so creamy you know what I
mean sometimes if it's not as creamy you
feel like you need to pull it more and
the reason is because you're trying to
get that line on there and straight I
cannot get this even though so that's
something I'm trying to cover you know a
shimmer and sometimes that tells a lot
about a liner when you're trying to
cover a shimmery shadow with it and
you're having difficulty there are liner
pencils out there that are really good
at so while I do think this is creamy
and black it's not the best when I tried
I think that the Milani
one I will link up a lot I can't see the
exact name but it's got a gold lid and I
really really like it it is insanely
black that might be my favorite
drugstore pencil liner and it would
cover the shimmer perfectly now this
still did a pretty darn good job but I
just think that one's better but this is
so good so if you had like a Sally's
gift card or you already buy and stuff
maybe they have like a sale or something
I know I'm really I don't shop at
Sally's often and it's not really
there's no reason I don't just I feel
like there aren't a lot of brands I'm
super interested in there
holy moly though I'm trying to wipe this
off with an elf makeup remover pen it's
like giving me some hex so does anyone
else follow like Dawg rapes on social
media where the dog like they're saying
it's like oh heck and it's H H asterisk
is ck and I think that's the cutest
thing they sell hats that say oh heck
with the little star instead of the e on
the heck and I kind of completely want
that because it's so cute and I'm just
such a dog thing like anyway all right
so I'm going to finish my
I'm really fast I like to put on some
liquid liner on top and then I have a
mascara to try some lip products eye
highlighter stay tuned okay so I by the
way I use the NYX epic ink liquid liner
it's my Holy Grail favorite it's like
$8.99 and I just kind of did a mini wing
and then went over that with it so the
mascara again the packaging feels very
high quality and that's kind of I feel
like most of these feel really nice it's
called the Worx wow effect all in one
mascara there's three shades it's $12.99
and it says unbelievable false eyelash
effect for a dramatic volume and length
we'll see about that
so let me brush through my lashes and
curl them I always brush through my
lashes and I feel like that makes such a
difference for me I mean you can use any
that you want and I just kind of gently
push my lashes through it because I feel
like especially when you put liner on
like I do it can it can tend to kind of
clump the lashes together in a way that
doesn't look nice so that just kind of
quickly separates them and it only takes
me like you know a millisecond and then
this is just a tweezer Minh lash curler
I have that's like really good for my
eye shape but I don't remember like
there were like two different versions
anyway so I'll curl the under oh not my
favorite kind of a wand but I'm not
gonna judge a book by its cover
it's um got really really short bristles
very rubbery
I don't always love these but let's just
see it's definitely the shade black
which is good for me the reason I think
I don't like this kind of a brush
typically is because I feel like it
doesn't it's a very wet formula I just
feel like it doesn't always how do I
explain it like it doesn't volume eyes
the way I want it to although I have to
say this is doing better than ones I've
used in the past but see now it's like
really clumping huh oh no what have I
done I have to film a lot today I hope
this looks alright so it's really like
it definitely volumizes quickly
which surprised me but it's clumping and
not in the way like I like the last
paradise because it clumps but like in a
feathery way I'm never gonna be able
explain this but this clumps like in a
plasticy like you're lit you have like
five lashes total it's like if you watch
Rugrats Angelica's doll Cynthia how her
hair is like in like three clumps I'm
gonna put a picture on the screen of
Cynthia the doll
that's what I feel like my lashes look
like it's oh crap and it's so wet it's
ruining my eyeshadow look above I'm
hating this you guys I haven't felt this
strongly about a massacre in a while
it's instantly like shorten these lashes
here I can't get like any length and
it's just like clumping them but again
not enough light I wish you guys could
see it in person cuz it's so hard to get
across there's literally 1 2 3 4 5 6
lashes over there and I like more of a
fanned out like I said feathery look I
know some people like this so if you
know you like this style then this might
be your cup of tea I don't think you
know from afar stop piling it on Jessica
um I don't think from afar that it looks
so bad but for me
knowing what I like and knowing that
there's other stuff out there for
cheaper cuz this is still what it's a
$12.99 I mean it's so kind of a pricey
mascara it's it's volumizing and clumpy
but it's clumpy right away so you need
to decide you know do you like that
style or not if you do then you might
actually really like it because like you
can even see I mean it it doesn't look
bad I hope I'm making sense
that's not one that I'm every purchase
again I'll tell you that well I didn't
buy it first time you know I mean
alright so they also sent this
highlighting liquid and then we'll do
some of their lip products it's called
the filter highlighting liquid and it's
in the shade porosity I'm just gonna put
some on my hand first it's a pump it's a
that was a nice glass bottle I like to
with stuff like this you could put it on
underneath all of your foundation I like
to just kind of tap it in the area I
want it's better with the Beauty Blender
but to be quite frank all of my dirty
I'm just gonna kind of use my own oh
this is sloppy I'm sorry you guys okay
so it really doesn't add anything
you see how it just like went away it's
just gone
let me blend I could see okay so like
that's it blended it really is almost
gone there's a very very slight thing so
I think this would work better and maybe
it's intended this way it just doesn't
say on there it would work better all
over your face underneath the foundation
not as an actual highlight because this
is not I mean you can see a tiny bit but
not it's hardly enough for me even for a
subtle look you know what I mean so I'm
gonna put a different highlighter on but
I'll have to again when I update you on
these things I'll have to let you know
like once I tried the other way how it
looks if you are curious I'm putting on
the Laura Mercier matte radiance baked
powder and highlight oh one that was
more than I intended but that's okay
first of all this is a lip pigment it's
their glitter and glow lip pigment and
top it off and this is $10.99 as three
shades it is truly like a pigment
there's no like little stopper anything
so it's a shimmery let me see if I can
like truly okay there's full-on glitter
in it it's a beautiful shade but boy
that is a glitter on your lips so it's
literally a powder you could put it on
top of lipstick you can probably wear it
alone I don't know how I'm not a big fan
if you can't tell if this kind of a
thing I think the idea is cool but after
about 30 minutes it's like so let me put
it on my lips to show you and then I'm
probably a white girl I had vaseline oil
or something to wipe that off so I'm
having to like literally now this is
gonna be best applied like over like
something like especially in the center
of your bottom lip I mean this is sloppy
I just want to give you an idea what it
looks like I know it's sloppy I don't
feel like doing the whole thing cuz it I
don't like the feel of like it rubbing
together my lips it's grossing me out
I'm gonna wipe it off so that's my own
problem I don't like that like I I
physically don't like that so the other
two products are much more my speed one
of them
is the map addiction liquid lip color
it's 999 there are ten shades right the
way the pigment did I don't know if I
said that has three shades so it says
insane color payoff in a single swipe
ultra matte finish for a second skin
feeling whoa
that's nice and like wow that is very
thin but it is a lot of color so and how
much should I say this was ten bucks
it's not bad it feels a lot like the Kat
Von D one where it really is like a
second skin so again I'm gonna put it on
but I'll probably wipe it off maybe wear
this today let me show you the other one
put it on wipe it off and then I might
put this on to like stay for at least
another video so this is their full body
lipstick there's 16 shades again they
have that matte black packaging for all
of these and it says eight of them are
matte eight is eight of them are satin
$10.99 this one is yes ma'am it doesn't
say if it's satin or matte I'll be the
judge of that Oh satin for sure very
pretty pink color it's just so
comfortable very standard lipstick not a
thick formula by any means you might
want to line it just because well I
guess it depends on the color I mean
this looks alright but I think it would
just look cleaner with a lip liner and
I'm not sure if they sell lip liners or
not but regardless I mean this would be
an easy shade to match but it feels
comfortable kind of moisturizing but not
like it's gonna rub off I mean obviously
there's gonna be transfer but not like
crazy so I like the formula I'd be
interested to try more shades now let me
put on the liquid lip one
pretty right so definitely a thinner
formula I mean it's a nice liquid
lipstick I would assume it's going to
dry down and kind of create that line in
the middle of your mouth because if you
think about it any liquid lipstick is
going to do that over time because where
your gums are it's wet with saliva and
you know for something to dry there
makes no sense
so it's going to create that line I can
already tell you but again I can update
you in that video but it's almost sticky
but not like in a transfer way
let me see still a little bit of
transfer I mean I just put it on that's
probably still drying but for the most
part it's dry I like the shades I even
mention it the shade is blood rush
mm-hmm perfect I feel like it's
appropriate with this thing obviously
I'm not wearing this this is just to
hold my hair back so I feel ready to
film some other videos I might for some
other videos pop some lashes on and
bronzer I didn't put that on but I mean
this is still a pretty glam ish look
it's like neutral glam the second you
had red lips it's like way more
glamorous than you intended you know but
it doesn't feel bad you guys know a lot
of us are moving away from liquid lips
because they're just so drying they're
not super comfortable
I don't mind reapplying lip products
throughout the day and the idea behind
it liquid lipstick is that you don't
have to but they're just so
uncomfortable and then you start like
wondering like how is it looking is
looking weird and crusty you know and I
don't just not worth that like mental
strain I need like I should put some
gold hoops on so anyway I'm gonna film
some other videos but I hope that you
enjoyed this style a video let me know
