my review and tutorial plush demo
with the new why is it so far away from
me hold on prop start the new Neutrogena
hydro boost foundation actually
technically it's called a hydrating tint
so I would like to think of this more as
it is and moisturizer than a foundation
but I'll explain why in a second let's
go and get into it so the price point on
these is $14.99 I'm on the Neutrogena
website so I know depending on the store
and coupons and sales that can totally
differ I don't think I spent $50 I think
I got it for like $12.99 or something
like that I have two shades the first
one I bought was classic ivory tend a
little bit too light for me so that I
went back and I bought nude 40 and this
one I think is a little bit more
accurate I'm wearing this today so let's
go ahead and get into the demo of me
applying this so you can kind of see the
coverage etc and then I'll talk about
the pros and cons of the product
okay so I've already put my glossy a
priming moisturizer that I love I've
already put that on my face and let it
kind of sink in so I've got two shades I
have nude 40 and then I also have
classic ivory 10 the shades in between
didn't seem to be right but obviously
number 10 is much lighter than 40 but it
was honestly like it worked but it was
just a little bit too light 40 was kind
of the right tone and it was a little
bit darker so that's what I'm going to
put on today I better get this mane of
hair out of my face
in the meantime so here's a huge doe
foot applicator I'm just going to kind
of take it all over the thing I have
notices there's never enough on the
brush you have to dip in a bunch of
times not that that really matters but
just for your information I want you to
put so much on the chin that's way too
much on the chin so I'm going to do half
of my face actually I need a little more
on the forehead eyes will go to town I'm
going to do half with the Beauty Blender
like I always do in half with a brush
today I'm going to use my our teeth
brush I for the last foundation demo I
did I used my drugstore dupe they're
both just as good it doesn't matter and
I'll link the drugstore version but
let's start with the Beauty Blender I'll
do that on this side
here
certainly covered up some of my
discoloration I mean it my skin
certainly looks much more even than it
was before and it does I think look a
lot more moisturizing with a Beauty
Blender let's try the rest with a brush
so looking at both sides okay this is
actually the perfect test when I touch
my skin this side is almost instantly
not matte but set it's not sticky or
tacky this side is still tacky now if
you've got dry skin I would say you
definitely want to opt for this this is
not a drying foundation by any means the
idea of it is that it's hydrating so
it's not that it's a really drying
foundation but I would just say general
little thumb if you have drier skin
Beauty blenders are going to be much
more friendly to dry skin than a brush
would be and I'm finding that I'm
reaching for sponges way more often
lately I want to see how much coverages
can get so let's put on another layer
so I just turned my lights down a bit
more so you can really see this I didn't
realize that had them on so bright you
can see a little bit more that you know
you still can see a little bit of kind
of redness that I naturally have on my
cheek I also have like a dog hair on my
nose
I wonder packaging wise if eventually
you just won't be able to get to the
bottom you know what I mean I feel like
there's going to be a lot of wasted
product and it's just based on the way
it's packaged I actually like the way
it's packaged but I do wonder about that
so I would say this is definitely light
to medium coverage I mean you can put a
bunch of layers on but it's not really
making a difference in to coverage so
that's what I mean when I say it's not
really buildable it's very comfortable
though no matter how you apply it I mean
I've got dry skin and you can see my
regular skin is breathing through and I
feel like it doesn't illuminate any dry
patches I usually have dryness here
especially right there oh my gosh anyone
else a dry skin right there and like
when you're in horrible like overhead
fluorescent lighting the first thing I
noticed is like dry skin right here and
I'm like oh my gosh like I said it
doesn't cover everything but for an
everyday look or just for a fresh-faced
look I think this is really nice if you
have a lot of redness or discoloration
or things that you want to cover this is
not the foundation for you period it's
just not that's not what it's marketed
towards however if you're wanting to
kind of look more put together and have
a more comfortable comfortable feel on
your face this is perfect for that and
again even though I have a feeling
there's going to be a lot of product
that you can't get to in the end in its
packaging I do feel like the packaging I
like the doe foot applicator maybe it's
just because it's kind of new for
foundation to me and so it's just fun I
don't know so obviously it is a lighter
coverage it is moisturizing the
packaging is really neat I think smell
wise it just kind of smells like classic
foundation it doesn't have like a strong
scented scent but it I mean it just kind
of smells like foundation if you will
they have ten shades a lot more lighter
shades than deeper unfortunately I mean
they're definitely different tones like
cool versus warm but still only ten
shades so it's not ideal the claims on
this on Neutrogena website it says it
applies flawlessly while instantly
quenching skin leaving skin so hydrated
it looks smooth and fresh all day
this foundation moisturizes and plumps
skin for 24 hours it creates a natural
moisturize and fresh look so it has
hyaluronic acid in it which my skin
loves that and I do feel like my skin
does likes it found a
I just think that it's not one that I
would pick for like if it's a special
event or I'm going out at night I don't
think this is ideal but I do think it
makes your skin look nice so if you're
going to be in weird lighting this might
be better than a full coverage
foundation because with full coverage
foundations for me because I've dry skin
it can really highlight weird areas
whereas the fist if I'm going to be in
weird lighting at least this makes my
skin out I just hit my funny bone
at least this makes my skin look healthy
so even if I'm not looking perfect it's
looking better than it would otherwise
does that make sense so I do like this I
would say this is not really a
foundation it's more of a tinted
moisturizer as I said at the beginning
it says it doesn't settle into fine
lines I mean I don't know I have some
like kind of pre wrinkles here and I
feel like it because it doesn't really
settle into them it's just not like I
don't know it's not suddenly getting rid
of wrinkles but again I don't have
enough wrinkles yet to know whether or
not how that makes it look because it
does say it's plumping so if you've
tried this and you do have maybe more
fine lines or some wrinkles and you
notice a good effect let us know below
if anyone else is curious and just if
you see someone comment that just like
it so it kind of gets bumped up to the
top as I wear it throughout the day I
don't notice it I do notice that it kind
of breaks apart throughout the day I've
worn this enough to know how it looks at
the end of a work day and you know I'm a
teacher some days can be more strenuous
than others but I don't think it's
necessarily a job where I'm like
sweating you know throughout the day I
do notice especially in this region here
it breaks down a little bit and again
because I've got more redness there I
tend to see it more throughout the day
so that is something to keep in mind you
might want to bring it with you or have
something to touch up if you know you're
not going to be able to go home and
touch up or whatever the case may be but
I still like it it's not you know I like
it it's one that I think it's really
comfortable for like a weekend if you're
just bumming around the house but you
want to look a little more put together
it's a really nice product it's got good
ingredients in it
it's just not my favorite for like glam
looks or you know when I really really
want to look flawless
