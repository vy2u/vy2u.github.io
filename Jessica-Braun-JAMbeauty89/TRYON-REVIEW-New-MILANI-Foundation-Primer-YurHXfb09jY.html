gonna be sharing with you a review and
Tryon of the brand new Milani conceal
and perfect two-in-one foundation and
concealer and also a Tryon review of the
Milani prime perfection face primer in
hydrating and pore minimizing and this
is oil free so these are $9.99 each at
the drugstore I found mine at a at an
endcap at Walmart I also I found mine at
an endcap in Walmart
I've also I'm online right here and I
see that online to buy it online
Walgreens sells it so I will link the
Walgreens links for both of these
products below again $9.99 let's go
ahead and get into the Tryon review I
did this side of my face with a brush
and this side of my face with my hand I
just I don't usually do my Tryon reviews
with the Beauty Blender because most
women in the world that aren't part of
the YouTube Beauty community don't they
don't know about our own Beauty Blender
so I like to do it with two more common
methods of applying it so let's go ahead
and get into it
so I've already put a moisturizer on I'm
just using a serum a moisturizer and I
let it sink in for a couple minutes I
usually do that like right when I get
out of the shower of course I've already
done my hair today but usually I just do
that right when I get out of the shower
but we're gonna go in first with the
Milani prime perfection face primer and
they had to
I picked the hydrating one because that
is kind of my problem is if I tend to be
anything at Bea I tend to be more dry
especially in the winter so just a
squeezy tube in it you know it's got
kind of an Elmer's glue type consistency
doesn't really have a smell it doesn't
seem so I'm just going to kind of Pat it
in the areas and the thing that I
struggle with with primers is making
sure I'm instead of just rubbing it
around kind of patting it in because you
want it to sink into your skin so you
got to rub it a little bit to get it
spread out but just kind of pushing it
into the skin so that it sits where you
need it which for me I feel like is
everywhere but I'm even going to put
some under my eye to see if it helps
hold on to concealer foundation
so it feels kind of um you can see it's
moisturizing it feels kind of knives it
does feel hydrating it doesn't feel like
oily I wouldn't say it feels like
hydrating but like it's sinking in so it
almost has like certainly like a lotion
II feel but it almost has that silicone
like velvety feel as well it's kind of
like a weird mix which would explain why
it's marketed as hydrating and pore
minimizing because you kind of need both
of those feels to make that work so it's
already sunk in I can tell it doesn't
feel tacky at all anymore
so I'm gonna wait about thirty more
seconds and then I'm going to put in put
on the foundation so for me the true
test with this will be if it covers like
I've got just little bits of
discoloration here my nose is always red
you know I've got veining and stuff here
so I'm just gonna apply it everywhere to
see how it covers that I chose the shade
zero one creamy vanilla it's got a pump
obviously and it's a glass jar so I'm
gonna kind of put it on my hand here and
we'll see about the color match I'm just
gonna kind of rub it in a little bit
first and then I'm gonna take my brush
and apply it where I want it this is
just a Sedona lace FBO 7 I've had it
forever I'm just gonna use it for this
um I'm gonna put I've already started
playing I'm going to put it I'm going to
do brush on this side and hand on this
side like I typically do with
foundations this might be too much
actually now that I'm seeing it the
color is a little more yellow than my
skin tone although I do have a little
bit more more skin tone so I'm not too
worried about this alright so lets blend
this in ooh okay this is yellow so not
the most ideal color match now we know
but let's at least look oh my it's
definitely not but let's at least look
at the texture of it and how it looks
once it's blended in and see if it
highlights dry areas if it conceals it
looks like it is concealing I mean
pretty well if you compare this side to
this side I mean it's definitely
concealing some stiff we pull my mirror
a little closer I mean it does conceal I
have to admit I mean this looks so much
more perfected than this side
let's try the rest kind of with my hand
and see how it applies should have like
wore a headband for this hmm I've got to
kind of blend that middle area I think
it's more perfected with the brush but I
also think I applied more over there so
let's let's put a little bit more on
over here and see if that does the trick
so I'm kind of thinking it it does a
good job of concealing that I think with
one to two passes you get pretty good
coverage so that is nice about that I
like the packaging if you've got really
dry skin I think it would claim cuz it's
clinging a little bit but usually once I
apply the heat of my hand or if you used
a wet sponge it would tip that it'll
dissipate so I don't think it's too bad
for you no normal to dry but if you've
got really dry skin I don't think you'll
like it think if you have oily skin you
would really like this because it's got
the good coverage it's kind of
mattifying and perfecting but without
being too much I think it's a good
balance to that I just need to get the
right color for sure it only feels a
little bit tacky it's been about a
minute now which isn't too bad I mean I
don't really mind that do I think it
looks super natural actually it doesn't
look bad you just really got to make
sure you blend it in well I think a
brush does do a better job in your hand
a Beauty Blender would probably do
really nicely too especially if you do
have dry skin because it'll kind of make
it melt it'll help it melt into your
skin a little deeper if you've got drier
skin but I think actually a brush did a
nice job with it a hand mmm I think the
brush did better so I started to do my
brows I'm sure I look like Frida Kahlo
right now but I was doing my brows and I
had a check back in because as I looked
really closely at my forehead now that
it's been a little you know a couple
more minutes there are like big-time dry
spots so I'm wondering
I don't know like I think if you even
have mild dry skin this might not work
like I've got a dry patch right there
and you can see it's oxidizing in that
area really badly um I think what I
realizing is I like the primer so I want
to try this with other things but the
foundation I'm going to need to try this
foundation with other primers maybe but
you know if it's not going to work with
other primers that I really really like
like the Maybelline blur and illuminate
I really like um and I also really like
the Too Faced hangover because they're
really moisturizing if it doesn't work
with those then I'll know like okay it's
just not good for dry skin but I also
want to try this primer with that
because this one out of the two this one
I think look the nicest on my skin so if
I were recommending one of the two it'd
be this but you know it is what it is so
obviously I'm kind of torn about the
foundation and we'll start with that
because it does have high coverage it's
not a perfect shade match although now
that I've kind of finished my face it
does look a little bit better but shape
match aside it does kind of eliminate
those dry spots so I am going to try it
with some other ways but you know upon
first glance for a drugstore foundation
I actually think it's pretty good do I
think it's the best one out there no I
really like the Revlon Colorstay whipped
if you have more oily skin I really like
that just a regular Revlon Colorstay I
also really like Neutrogena has a really
nice BB cream and you know there's so
many foundations out there for the
different types of skin so you've got to
keep that in mind I think if you have
oily skin this really would be a nice
foundation because if I didn't have just
those few dry patches it really does
look nice so I also love the packaging
another Pro I love that it's got a pump
it you know so many drugstore
foundations don't and it drives me
bonkers because they're you know when
you're trying to shake it out and you
can buy like little pumps for them
online they don't have a very big shade
range I'm looking at it on online and it
has eight shades and they do not go very
dark at all so if you're a deeper skin
gal there is no way you're going to find
the color you need so that again as
usual is a shame the smell of this
actually it doesn't have a strong smell
but it almost like it's just a kind of
clean smell but again it's one that I
barely notice I only noticed because I
intentionally smell it for my reviews so
not one if you're sensitive to smells
this won't bother you at all not at all
um so let's talk about the primer this
first of all only has 0.688 fluid ounces
it's only filled to like here so that is
like a lie there's like nothing in this
but in it you can tell like when you
feel it I'm like what like what it
literally is half full so that's kind of
a shame especially for $10 for a
drugstore primer that's a lot I really
like I had it here because I knew I
wanted to talk about the Maybelline
master primed blur and illuminate this
one has a full fluid ounce so it you
know not quite double this has almost 27
but it's definitely got more it's a
little bit cheaper I want to say this is
under $8 might be even cheaper and with
the coupon of course you can get it
pretty cheaper but I love this stuff I
love it so much so if you're kind of you
know looking I know I love this one I
would recommend it especially if you've
got normal to dry skin um this one I I
do like I again want to try it some more
it's it's the type of primer I like
where it's hydrating it just feels good
so I'm going to try it with a couple of
like BB creams that I use and some other
foundations and I'll have to get back to
you so for both of these I can update
you on my social media I haven't really
done that ever but I was thinking I'm
like you know this is so hard these
first impression Tryon reviews because
it's only a first impression like
there's only so much I know so um I will
update you guys on my social media
definitely on my Instagram and Twitter
so follow me on there the my I handle on
there's Jam Beauty 89 as it is on all my
social media so stay tuned for that so
quick rundown the pros of the foundation
high coverage better for oily skin great
packaging no smell $10 is a
kind of becoming a normal price for a
foundation definitely see if you can
wait for a sale if you got normal to dry
skin though I would say steer clear the
primer again $10 I think it's a little
steep for the less amount of product
that you get I do think it is a nice
primer though on upon first glance so
it's worth a shot
hopefully this review is helpful for you
guys if you'd like to see more of my
drugstore Tryon reviews that I've done
for tons of different foundations

Sun I will link some videos I've done
