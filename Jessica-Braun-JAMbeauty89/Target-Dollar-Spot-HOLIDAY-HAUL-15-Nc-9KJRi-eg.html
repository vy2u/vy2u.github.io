going to share with you guys my target
dollar spot haul this is all Christmassy
things some of them are gifts I'm
planning for I've got like a kind of
secret pal at school and I've got a
hopefully she doesn't watch my videos
they're just now thought about that um
and I just got some other ideas for
stockings and things and they have so
many amazing things so if you don't know
about the target dollar spot well you
probably know about it but if you don't
not everything's a dollar some things
are three dollars some things are five
they're all marked on the label which is
nice you at least know because things
get really jumbled around and they're
and of course it's really hit or miss
you know it really depends on the
targets that I go to because some of
them they're dollar spots just aren't
well stocked other ones they're just so
picked through you know just because it
is the holiday season and people are
already starting to shop for little
things like stocking stuffers and cute
little decorations etc so I've got gifts
like I said I have some decorations some
candles and I even have some things I'm
going to use in my classroom so let's go
ahead and get into it so the first thing
that I found that I was really excited
about were these candles and it's in the
scent holiday spices and it says has a
burn time of up to 15 hours and it just
is that really nice kind of like spice
cupboard type smell very holiday like
but it's not pure cinnamon it's kind of
a nice mix I would say though if you
don't like cinnamon you wouldn't like
this but these were three dollars so I
got more than one I'm gonna keep one and
give one as a gift but I even thought
they're decorated really cute
you know the tin is just adorable I like
that it's got a little bit of blue I
feel like you don't see a lot of navy
blue and holiday things and I think it's
really pretty this next thing I got I'm
not sure where I'm gonna put them I'm
thinking in my classroom there are these
little stars and they're LED string
lights and it's six feet long you have
you need a some batteries two double-a
batteries it says so I haven't tried
them but they just look so cute and like
kind of delicate and I thought it'd be
really pretty maybe just on my desk
especially since it's battery-powered it
doesn't need to be plugged in maybe I'll
even use it back here I never even
thought about that
so anyway I'm really excited I just
think these are cute and these were five
dollars so they were a little bit
pricier so they also have these tins
and they're so cute I actually use these
exact tins for different holidays
throughout the year to hold my pens and
highlighters and stuff on my teacher
desk so I loved this one it's like looks
like a little Christmas sweater with the
red and white these were only a dollar
they're pretty sturdy for what they are
they I mean you can if you squeeze it it
will Bend so it's not like crazy sturdy
but I mean they're it's ten it's not
going anywhere anytime soon and then I
figure for the wintertime I might switch
to this one so for like January in
February
it's just that really pretty kind of
blueish green with silver little
snowflakes so I thought these are so
perfect and I don't think you know that
doesn't scream Christmas so it's I don't
think it'll be expensive or anything
like that in school okay so they had so
many cute socks I'm gonna make sure I've
got all the socks I bought okay I had to
I literally had ten in my hand because
they were all a dollar each and I was
like I'm buying all these some of them
for guests and I was like okay Jessica
you need to be realistic so I put a
bunch of back but these were my
favorites so I got two pairs of these
cuz I'm gonna give one to someone else
but they're the fluffy socks and my
thing is I don't like to spend a lot of
money on fluffy socks because I feel
like the minute you do you wash them in
the washer and dry them and then they're
like never the same so for a dollar I
don't mind if they don't last me two
years you know whereas their ones a bath
the Body Works I love but they I mean
they don't last very long for me and
they're like six dollars so I love that
I love that they were running a mini
honestly but then it's got the green
little cinched part so I love that I got
two of those and like I said those were
only a dollar and then I got another
pair of fuzzy ones and they're just kind
of more you know you can wear them any
time of year but they were just so cute
and then these these are not the fluffy
kind they're just normal socks but I
loved that it had the pretty like kind
of purplish pink and then it's got the
little reindeers with it so I'm very
excited all of those for a dollar and
they had so the next thing I got were
these little gell Klingons I've never
had this gel kind before but I thought
these little lights were so cute and we
like to decorate kind of our patio door
and things like that so I figured these
could kind of go along with any other
window clings we put up just
the Christmas lights so love that
definitely gonna use that and these were
only a dollar
so something nerdy about me and my
husband is that we love like really
cheesy holiday plates so for Halloween
we from the target dollar spot got four
different like kind of Halloweeny
cheap plates ones that you can't even
put in the dishwasher they're so cheap
so we always said again wash them but we
love them they're just so fun so they
had four different Christmas ones as
well they were only a dollar and they're
the same exact style but this says
little Santa it says ho ho ho and then
this one striped with the reindeer and
then this is a little gingerbread man
with candy canes and then the cute
little let it snow snowman so it even
says not microwave safe not dishwasher
safe hand wash away so you know there's
not a ton you can do for these but if
you wanted like a cookies for Santa kind
of plate for really inexpensive this
would be a great option if you've got
kids and you do that or maybe you just
do it anyway I just thought those are so
cute and we love them and you know they
don't last forever but while we're using
them it's just fun okay I am very
excited about these these are kitchen
towels and I'm kind of like a snob with
kitchen towels like there's a very
particular kind that I like that
actually you know if you're drying a
dish with it it actually dries it and
doesn't just wipe water around you guys
know what I mean or that you know just
you know you're wiping a counter down
and it doesn't ever properly dry out
that drives me bonkers so these were
just so cute I don't know that I'll
necessarily use use these although they
actually feel really well made but it's
a 2-pack and it was three dollars for a
2-pack and they're kind of a nice like
woven texture but it's got the cute red
and black plaid and then it's got this
kind of cream one that just says joy and
I thought these are so pretty so cute
they had a bunch of different dish
towels but these just happen to be my
favorite I there was another one I had
in my hand but in the end I went with
these but for three bucks so a dollar
fifty each these would be great too I
ran into actually an old co-worker of
mine in while I was shopping for this
stuff and she was saying she always gets
these especially ones with patterns like
these so if she makes some kind of
basket for people for Christmas which
she does she'll use that to kind of
the stuff and then you know when they
take the Raskin hole and they also have
this little towel to use so I thought
that's such a cool idea again kind of a
gift-giving little tip from her all
right so Tyler and I also love having
people over we love having like little
dinner parties and I wish we did it even
more often than we do but we do it a
decent amount and we've realized we
really need more like platters and nice
dishes not like expensive but just like
cute dishes to put things on other than
just our plates that we have so these
were three dollars it was a pack of two
and it's this red and black you know
again it matches that the red and black
plaid and I just thought these were so
cute for the holidays you could use them
any time I just fell in love with these
and he's excited about them too so I
just think they're really cute you can
put little cookies on him you could put
you know cheese's if you have that or
crackers out just like little finger
foods some more things I got for my
classrooms I'm so excited about one of
these is the this little thing of sticky
notes it's a little snowman and I liked
it was lined I've never owned that's not
true not never but I don't typically own
post-its that have lines on them and I
kind of like that because I usually use
them for a little quick daily to-do list
but these were only a dollar and they're
so cute and I figure if I got one that
was specifically Christmas I probably
wouldn't use it up in time well I
probably would but this I could use
throughout you know the season into
January February and not feel like it's
purely a December kind of stack of
papers then this one this one says let
it snow and it's a stamp and I am so old
school raise your hand if you're a
teacher and you use stamps I do and so
I've got like the smelly stamp pads it
smell really good like blueberries and
strawberries and I have a huge stamp
collection because I love using them but
these this one says let it snow and I
figure again I can use it all throughout
winter and it's not offensive it's not
one specific holiday over the other so
I'm so excited to have this and stamps
can be so expensive so I mean like
weirdly expensive 1015 dollars I've seen
like in craft stores so for this to be a
dollar I was like yes I was wishing they
had some more but this was the only one
I felt made sense for me to use in my
classroom
so a couple more things this is a card
display and it's just like I mean
literally it's like yarn you can see so
it's yarn but it's got all these little
kind of miniature clothespin hooks that
you can just hang your cards on I
haven't decided we're gonna have it here
or if I'm gonna use it at school kind of
depends I mean we get off on winter
break like pretty early so I might not
use it at school I don't know so I think
I'll use it here but it's so cute I just
thought and how much this was $3 and
they show like an idea of how you could
use it where it has the star on the top
and then you kind of drape it like this
like a tree that would be really really
cute so it's shaped like a tree the last
thing I got in the target dollar spot
and I'm not kidding when I say I had
like 20 more items in my car and I put
them back because I was like Jessica
calm down but it's just a cute little
advent calendar and this was three
dollars and you know it's not super
well-made it's just felt but you hang it
by the little string here and then you
have your little Christmas tree and you
just put it in the pocket of whatever
day it is now this is the part where
because it's cheap it's really hard to
get it in there there we go so I just
thought there it is it's just so cute
and simple now one thing I know that was
really weird
was that on the 25th it looks like
someone just wrote it in like it
literally literally looks like a sharpie
or a paint marker where they wrote
25-inch so that was just kind of odd and
it was kind of funny but this is one of
those things that I love advent
calendars and I would love to like buy a
really nice one from like Disney World
or somewhere in the future once we have
a home and not an apartment we're kind
of waiting on those kinds of things
because we don't want to just move them
but anyway that would be one I
eventually want to spend money on a nice
one since I love them but in the
meantime this is so so cute and if
you've never had one this is the perfect
kind of little starter one I guess but I
just thought it was adorable you just
hang it on a door handle or just on a
hook somewhere you know whatever but I
love it hopefully this was helpful
hopefully you maybe got some ideas for
things you could put in someone stalking
some things to give to your child's
teacher oh my gosh I mean there's a
million
you could do things to help you build
little baskets for people maybe even
things just for people on your list
regular presents like the socks and
things like that I hope that you'll
subscribe to catch more and I'll see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
