haul for you and I know you're probably
thinking you have been doing so many
hauls lately but in all fairness I had a
gift card and I also had a coupon and
this is a target haul and on target.com
they have coupons all the time and a lot
of times pretty much more often than not
they have like clothing coupons so for
example I used to keep on that was five
dollars off of a twenty dollar women's
clothing purchase and you just have to
look at the fine print and make sure and
see what brands it includes because for
example this coupon it had to be
Massimo or Massimo Supply Company and
exhilaration were like the three brands
and you could mix and match with in
those brains but those had to add up to
$20 then you could get the $5 off but
the good news is it includes sale and
clearance items so everything I got was
on sale or was on clearance and you'll
see so I got the $5 off basically I got
like a free shirt out of it so win-win
so that is my excuse for why I have
another target haul so here we go
okay so one thing I picked up right off
the bat was this four pack of the
chapstick classic I talked about it one
of my previous videos I have been loving
just the original chapstick formula and
like I literally see a change in my lips
they're just so moisturize all the time
and they're just healthier than they
used to be because I used to use all
kinds of medicated chap sticks so anyway
so I've really been loving this and so I
got this four pack it's three bucks for
four so it's awesome and I've only seen
these like value packs or whatever at
Target I haven't seen them anywhere else
so definitely go check it out if you're
interested in these or if you know you
like them and you'd want a million of
them okay so another thing I got is this
was on clearance and I was so excited
because I'm going out tonight actually
so this is perfect this is this little
like wristlet type thing but it kind of
got form to it or structure I guess and
you push the button to open it and it
has a slot for like cards and things
right but then it also has this little
these little elastic things here so you
can put your phone inside of it and it
doesn't fall out when you open your
purse it's so awesome and it's in the
phone I've already tried it like with my
phone in it case it fits in there
perfectly and still shuts it's got this
wristlet I just love it and it was on
clean
for 388 and it's as cute like melon
color win-win okay another thing I got
okay so elf now has this smudge brush
and it's like I guess I could take it
out of packaging it was only a dollar
because it's part of their professionals
line and those are the dollar items for
the most part and you know they have
tons more products online but I really
don't look at their website too often
but this is like this really really
short brush and it is so cool and
perfect for smudging you know eye shadow
underneath your eye there if you want or
just smudging out eye line or anything
it is doing this though I haven't used
this and you guys can't see it's like
powders like coming up I don't know what
the deal is
mmm anyway also side note sorry about
the lighting it is so rainy out so I'm
having to like rely on like my own
lights which are no go so sorry it's a
little dark okay oh my gosh one of my
favorite finds these were on clearance
and I just saw someone on my Instagram
commented on I took a picture of all
these things and put it on there and I
think it was crispy commented and said
something like I see a clearance tag on
those earrings I'm like but of course
but these look how cute these are oh my
gosh there they have this baby blue and
then this like darker blue and they're
just these huge fun funky earrings I
love these earrings and I'd be getting
really into baby blue and you'll see in
a second I also have a baby blue shirt
so cute and these were only 398 and they
were originally you know like $8 $7.99
so cute they had a ton of earrings on
clearance whoo okay um also I got these
little things and they're leopard print
with some pink and they're perfect to
hold brushes and they were a dollar each
in the target dollar section I should
have gotten more than two I might go
back but um I figure like for face
brushes and I brushes how perfect you
could store so many things in these nail
things I mean anything the world is your
oyster I love them and they have a few
other patterns I think they have like
black and white one and then I think
they had some plain colored ones too so
cute and they were only a dollar okay
onto clothes so first things first I'll
show you this shirt okay this was on
clearance what I like about it that's
gonna be difficult to show it like is
high in the front and low in the back
right and then it's just long-sleeve
just a plain scooped neck tee tee
but it's kind of this nice like woven
texture but it's still thin it is so
comfortable oh my goodness is so
comfortable I love it and it was like I
think seven dollars in the clearance
section but the other three shirts I got
were all on sale they weren't
necessarily on clearance one they have
these dressy tees and I have one that I
think my boyfriend's mom got me for
Christmas that's like a dark purple that
I love so when I saw they had white I
was like yeah just a plain white v-neck
but it's really like this nice drapey
material I don't really know how to
describe it elastic and like just like
really flowy and drapey and these are so
cool especially a white one it's nice to
just have a nicer white shirt in your
closet that's just kind of simple
because you can wear so many different
colors with it you know there's just so
much you can do with them and these were
only I think this was only like seven
dollars right now and they have tons of
color so definitely if you're they're
perfect for work but they're also
perfect for just like any day so I love
that about them so I also got this
really bright it's almost like
fluorescent melon colored shirt it's
another v-neck these are only like six
or seven dollars but they're only
originally eight so even if they're not
on sale it's still a really good deal
but I just love these this one has a
little pocket detail here but they're
just so comfortable and again you can
dress them up at night like with funky
necklaces or daar but you can also just
wear them with a pair of jean shorts and
just you know be throwing the frisbee
out in the backyard which is what my
boyfriend and I do like all summer long
we're total nerds anyway if you guys saw
my Instagram picture last night of us
playing our Disney trivia game and like
watching another like Disney classic
movie I think we were watching like
prints in the popper and like quick
total nerds anyway okay and then also
this maybe blue v-neck shirt and oh my
gosh when I first saw this color I was
like yes it is so beautiful and again
these were like six or seven bucks I
think these were six and they have so
many colors they have some with patterns
but they're just so comfortable they're
not too form-fitting you know what I
mean but they also don't make you look
like you know really wide either they're
just the perfect amount of that so I
love those and I think that is all I got
at Target so if you're enjoying these
please subscribe and I'll see you guys
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
