target haul makeup but it's actually
really honestly truly just Sonia Kashuk
makeup cuz I went on a rampage the other
day because we were at Target and I was
like you know what I feel like I own a
couple of Sonia Kashuk products I don't
hear a lot on youtube I mean you hear a
decent amount like their blushes are
pretty good some of their eyeshadow
quads are okay and that's some of what I
own but I was like you know I want to
try more I want to see what's out there
and show you guys what's out there and
kind of give you my two cents so I put
this back in the target bags but I've
been trying all of them out so I'll give
you my two cents on them I've been using
them for a couple weeks now so I'm not
totally solid and how I feel about them
but I do have at least kind of an idea
of whether you should just stay away
most importantly or if maybe it's worth
thinking about by looking into so let's
go ahead and get into it should we start
with the dot or should we start like
positive mmm let's just start with the
Doug cuz I'm thinking about it this is
the Sonia Kashuk duh extreme where I
primer and it comes in this little pot
it's got like frosted glass and then
like a matte lid it's heavy it's made of
like glass and it has this nude for my
skin tone not nude for everyone but nude
colored but kind of cream beige colored
primer now I expected this to maybe be a
dupe for like like the Mac Paint Pots in
like painterly or soft ochre something
like that no like it has no coverage at
all that would be fine that would be
fine if it was a really good primer mmm
like it's okay I can't say that it's
terrible it's not like the worst thing
I've ever tried but I will say about
halfway through the day my eyeshadow
just wasn't looking as good as it
usually does with like anything else I
ever use like the Milani eyeshadow
primer I've use the Too Faced one
drugstore high end didn't matter they
usually work but this primer really just
didn't and on top of that it's hard to
get your finger into this tiny hole and
that's driving me nuts
because I feel like when I get lowered
down like if I really liked it and
wanted to keep using it it would be
impossible I be like scraping it out
with my nail will be gross so they need
to make this bigger and they also need
to make the product better so I know if
you curious about anything I'm wearing
whether it's my shirt my lipstick my
eyeshadow whatever it's all listed and
linked down below alright let's get into
some face products that I bought these
seemed new to me and maybe they've had
them for a while I don't know the first
thing I picked up out of those is the
primer base perfecting brightening
primer and I thought gosh this might be
similar to like the Mac strobe cream
which I've been trying out lately thanks
to a lovely subscriber that sent it to
me it's it's alright I've used it a
couple times now I will say if it looks
like I have a beauty mark right there
and there and there and like there it's
because I'm breaking out and I'm trying
to figure out what it is and I think
it's one of these two products it's not
both so I don't know so I'm like nervous
to try this anymore right now I want to
give my skin a break but it does have a
similar look to it as like the Mac
strobe cream does where you could mix it
with foundation you could just put it on
first as a primer as it's marketed but
it does have kind of an iridescent look
to it I wouldn't say it says iridescent
as the strobe cream is but it's still
nice so I only use this a couple times
before I paused using it because I was
breaking out but it's yeah it's got a
very soft feel to it not quite like a
silicone feel but it is soft I liked it
is it like my favorite primer ever
didn't make a huge difference no but I'm
gonna keep using it and kind of feel it
out because if it's a dupe for the
stroke cream that'd be awesome I don't
think it's exact so far but even if it's
close that'd be pretty awesome the other
thing I've only used a couple times is
there perfecting luminous foundation
this has the same packaging where it's
like hard and it's got the pump and it
was nice it was kind of luminous it
didn't make you look oily though which I
liked
is it a favourite of mine no the
coverage is okay it was enough for what
I like cuz I usually use a BB cream but
again I want to keep using it a little
more once my breakups clear up so I'll
have to get back to you on these
I want to say go run out and buy them
right now just yet so kind of a fun
product they sell and it's cute
is there dramatically brightening Kajal
crayon and it's like this white I mean
it's really long it's literally a white
crayon for your face so you could use it
you could literally highlight with it if
you want I used it and I'll kind of put
a little bit on on the inner corner of
my eye right there
you do kind of have to blend it cuz
otherwise it just kind of looks like a
white crayon I also used it under my
brow bone and it was awesome for that
because I just literally took it and
just like right under my brow and a
little bit under and then I just used my
ring finger to kind of blend it down it
was awesome for that because of that
really pointed tip which I love for
exactly that reason it's also great for
that because of the pointed tips so I
just thought this is fun useful and
really cute packaging too so this is one
you might want to look out for another
thing I finally purchased is the Sonia
Kashuk blush in flushed and a lot of
people talk about their blushes I've
only used this a couple times it is very
pigmented the first time I used it it I
had too much on I had to try and blend
it out with a powder foundation because
I had to go to work beautifully
pigmented you really have to use a light
hand with it but or like a stipple brush
really kind of nip that in the bud
but it's a beautiful pink color I am
curious to try the other shades but I
want to play with this some more before
I invest any more money into it but it
did stay on all day which for me on that
day that I tried it the first time was
not great because it was too much so
it's just kind of funny but if you use a
light hand apply it properly it stays on
all day it's beautiful so the next thing
I can't believe it has taken me like
three and a half years to buy this
I remember hearing about this it's their
hidden agenda concealer palette people
talked about this on YouTube years ago
and they still are and I hadn't bought
it and I finally did cuz I was like you
know what it's been years I need to
finally try this but I'm not big on
concealers that are in pants like this I
like liquid type concealers so I bought
it I tried it
have like a lighter and a little bit
darker of like an ivory color and then
more of a yellow tone one and then they
have like an ivory powder the creams are
creamy there they are there they don't
blend as well as I had hoped the powder
is okay as well again this is one that
I've tried it on my face on the many
breakouts I've got right now I've also
tried to under my eyes I liked it better
on breakouts that I did under my eyes I
just felt like it was too dry under my
eyes and I have a little bit of dry skin
right there right now and it just kind
of accentuated it and the powder
definitely didn't help I've tried it
with a brush and with my finger so I
don't think it's a bad product
it's just compared to things I tried
like the mac prolongwear concealer is
incredible even like I just pulled this
out of my drawer even the L'Oreal
visible lift one is incredible this
concealer is so good I would recommend
this both for face and for eyes over
this any day so just you know keep that
in mind but I know a lot of people love
this so that could just be me because
I've got dry skin right now so the last
Sonia Kashuk products I bought are two
different eyeshadows things I'm going to
start with this little six pan one it's
called
bare necessities and it just looks like
a really pretty neutral palette and you
know to be honest it needs probably at
least one darker color but these are
shadows that are so up my alley for
everyday as a teacher then I'm just like
I just want it here they are there I
know it's kind of a weird spot they're
really pigmented they blend beautifully
Sonia Kashuk really does have nice eye
shadows however I have some of their
quads and they have like this these
glitter shadows and the glitter is so
chunky in them that you can't they just
go everywhere I mean they really end up
all over your face so for me I would
definitely stay away from those but
their other shadows are gorgeous and so
buttery it's so blendable this palette
is one of my favorite things I've bought
like ever it's their ion neutral shimmer
and it's just got all of these no okay
well I will say I love the packaging I
love that it's simple but some of the
shadows like falling out like this
literally needs to be glued in I don't
know if you can see that it's falling
out but anyway of this one is two but
they're so shimmery again so they're so
beautiful i swatched them here which is
a weird place but they're so metallic
and beautiful and they blend beautifully
I just love them taking up a little bit
of powder but not really much I mean not
enough that it would be a problem at all
but they're so gorgeous they can be worn
I mean honestly like even this shape you
can wear alone on your lid and leave
like it is so gorgeous so those were all
of the products that I bought from
Target from Sonia Kashuk hopefully you
