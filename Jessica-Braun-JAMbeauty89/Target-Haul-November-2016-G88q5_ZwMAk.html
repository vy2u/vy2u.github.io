a target haul I haven't done a target
haul and I don't even over the last time
I did one like a million years I've got
hat hair because I bought a hat and I'm
gonna show it to you in a second you
might have seen it in the thumbnail
depending on what thumbnail actually
chose alright so I got a couple things
that are very like fashionable and not
necessarily makeup related so I wanted
to do this video separate from like a
drugstore makeup haul which I will also
be filming so if you're interested in
the fashion side of it this is the video
for you so the first thing I got I
finally gave in and got one of these
cute freaking hats
this was $24.99 it was in the you know
like hat section duh even my husband
liked it I was so surprised because I
pulled it out he said you never wear
hats
oh it's like funny it's like oh my gosh
it looks so pretty alright but I think
it's so cute also you could go as like
Carmen Sandiego which I might be doing
for Halloween because there we go but I
think it is so pretty I think the color
is gorgeous we travel all the time in
different places and I feel like this is
something I could easily travel with and
mix with so many different outfits I
just really like it I think the details
are really cute it's just a really thin
you know kind of faux leather brim or
ribbon around the brim that's pretty
much it I mean that it's so simple so I
really really liked that I was very
excited to finally have what next thing
is this purse I don't know why I love
this so much I'm really into smaller
more structured purchase purses this one
was $29.99 and it's a crossbody and it's
adjustable they just had it tied in the
store so I haven't undone it um although
I might wear it that way who knows so
the back has like this pocket here and I
loved the navy blue I think they had a
couple of colors but when you open it it
just is just a little snap to show you
how big it is inside so it's just an
open inside but it has like a little
pocket right there on the side and then
the other side has an actual zipper
pocket and the brand is Moroni but it's
so simple I like that it was the gold
hardware with it that it was simple
again great for travel great for
everyday whatever I just liked it a lot
I don't know again I don't know
what it was about this that caught my
eye and I thought I need it because it's
not like it looks like anything
spectacular but I just really liked it I
think it's so cute especially for fall
and winter so very excited about that
the next thing I got are these
sunglasses look at these aren't these
emits hard to see like in the ring light
aren't these amazing they look like you
know Faure bands I love that it's got
like that classic my gravy and type top
in the same shape but I liked it was the
color like the bluish green I don't know
if that's coming across on camera it's
like a bluish green tint to it but I
liked it because I own Ray Bans but I
wanted to get like a really standard
like I'm gonna spend the money on a pair
of ray-bans or anything's but I want
them to be something that will match
tons of outfits I don't want to get a
crazy so like these bluish green tint
which again you're not really seeing on
camera you can kind of see it there um I
get I wouldn't want to buy a $120 pair
of this or 200 or whatever so for this I
was like $14.99 is perfect because I
will wear them all the time but I won't
be as concerned if they break so I can
just kind of throw them around a little
bit more why am i throwing around my
sunglasses I don't know I also got this
shirt okay I realized I need more
pajamas and loungewear and I know that
sounds so weird to like go shopping for
pajamas have you ever but I need more
pajamas so the only thing I saw that
really caught my eye this time was from
champion it's actually in there like
activewear line but it's just this
really simple like sweater I liked how
it was just kind of different
I liked the green and it's just comfy
it's kind of baggy and just like cozy
calm for fall Tyler always makes fun of
me for sometime he doesn't make fun of
me but I always say I'm kind of getting
cozy comes like he knows what I mean get
into those cozy camps so it was a very
quick haul but I wanted to show that
stuff to you guys let you know there's a
lot of cute stuff at Target there might
be a future target haul on my channel
soon because there were a lot I was kind
of in a rush when I was there and there
were a lot of things that I almost
bought and I'm now I'm still thinking
about my life that's a sign that
bought it so we'll see but yeah so
hopefully you enjoyed if you have any
target all on your channel please
know about it because I love watching
these I'm kind of in one of those target
moods right now fall always gets me in
the target mood I don't know what it is
fall and Christmastime it's just like I
always want to go to Target I feel like
in the spring and summer I don't go that
often that's not true I'm always at
Target but you guys know what I mean
anyways I hope you'll subscribe before
you leave and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye
