going to share with you guys some of my
favorite and least favorite products
that I bought at Target so all of these
brands I mentioning today are ones that
are found at Target in the United States
some of them are brands that are still
sold elsewhere they're sold in other
places especially online but I know like
for example one of the brands going to
mention is number seven which I know is
sold like in the UK elsewhere but here
in the United States the only place I've
seen these brands is in Target other
than online these are all brands that
you know I've tried little bits here and
there of them and so I've kind of got an
idea of products I would recommend to
you guys maybe if you have a Target gift
card and you want to buy some makeup
that's not just the traditional
Maybelline covergirl kind of drugstore
brands but that I still think are really
good and there's also some that I think
you maybe should avoid I will link all
of the products that I mentioned of
course down below if you're interested
in checking them out or seeing how much
they cost whatever I will put all of
that below okay this is future Jessica
and I needed to butt into the video at
this point to let you know that this is
gonna be a long video so strap in as I'm
getting towards the end of filming this
video I'm looking at the time stamped
I'm like oh my gosh is so long so I felt
like future Jessica should warn you guys
in the past that that it's gonna be a
long one so you might want cup of coffee
or cup of tea let's start with the brand
that makes my heart happy and many of
the products I've tried from them I've
really really liked and that brand would
be pixie you can tell you're looking at
the pixie section when everything is
like this light green color one of my
favorite products is their pixie glow
ssin de doo and I have compared this to
the original Mac strobe cream it's just
kind of a white cream you can put it on
as almost like a primer so your skin
looks glowy you could mix it with your
foundation or BB cream you could just
strategically place it in certain spots
on your skin I love this stuff it's
really really good price-wise I mean
it's still kind of pricey and really
that's true for some of these for most
of these brands some of their products
really are kind of pricey where it's not
necessarily drugstore prices but it's
not necessarily called drugstore I mean
it just kind of depends on your
definition of it I guess but I love this
stuff
it just makes your skin look glowy if
you have really dry skin this helps to
at least make your skin not look dry I
don't know that necessarily moisturizes
your skin very well but I do know that
it helps bring that glow into your skin
whereas really mattifying products can
really make your skin obviously look
really matte maybe
accentuate any dryness that's a problem
I have so I really like this I don't
typically put this like on my nose my
nose is always shiny it's always red so
I don't like to bring attention to it
but I love this stuff everywhere else on
my face especially like on my cheeks and
maybe even maybe on the tip of my nose
that would be about as far as I would go
but I love this stuff another product I
did not think I would like and I don't
know why it kind of sounded gimmicky to
me I don't know it's a toner they sell
I've actually only tried this smaller
size but once I run out of this I'm
probably going to buy it the full size
it's their glow tonic and it's an
exfoliating toner and if you're used to
hearing exfoliators and you think of
like you know something with some like
roughness to it so that it can rub away
those dead skin cells an exfoliating
toner with like say glycolic acid like
this one has works on a deeper level
almost on a chemical level where it's
just encouraging like the kind of
turnover of the cells or as you know an
exfoliator one is just like a surface
exfoliator so this one goes a little bit
deeper and I really like this stuff
every time I've used it whether it's at
night before I put on like my serum and
everything or I've even done it
sometimes in the morning when I've had
enough time to let it kind of sink in it
really does like kind of even out my
skin it makes my skin look fresh it's
kind of like the look that my face has
after I do like a sheet mask how it just
looks really nice and like just ready
for makeup or for sleep whatever this
makes it look really really good as well
and so I don't know I don't know how
long lasting those benefits are like you
know if I'm using this every single day
is it really really improving my skin I
don't know but I will say ever since I
started using this I don't have any more
dry skin I used like I swear a couple
weeks ago I had dry skin here
I had it all over the place here I
always have it here I don't have any dry
skin anywhere so I'm trying out a couple
of things so I don't know if this is why
I really like
the way my skin looks every time I use
this so I don't know I'll have to keep
you guys updated with my natural wavy
curly ish textured hair today just cuz I
felt like my hair needed like a heat
break for a while so I have three of the
next product I'm going to mention these
are the pixie multi balms and I've got
one that's like more of a light baby
pink and it's called watermelon veil I
have one that's more of like a kind of
coral pink and it's called baby petal
and then one that's really like mauve
and kind of blue tone pink called wild
rose these I would say they are a nice
product and of course the idea behind
any kind of multi balm and these are
kind of everywhere using multi balm
multi balm the idea behind these is that
you can use them anywhere you can use
them on your lips you can use them as
like a you know cheek color
I'm sure you could maybe use them on
your eyes but I don't put this kind of a
pink on my eyes often anyway but these
are really really big which I appreciate
because I've got some of the bolt bite
multi sticks and I also have some of the
like pure ones I've got a couple and
they're all so small that the way I like
to use them is literally take a
stippling brush and just stipple it into
there and then put it onto my cheeks as
like the blush and with these I can
actually do that where as with the other
ones they're so small it's like okay no
that's not going to work but they just
twist up it comes with it I would say a
decent amount of product and they're
creamy enough that you can apply it
without like making your skin look crazy
but like for me there are some cream
products look how bright this is there
are some cream products that just look
crazy instantly um I will say the shades
do matter the shade you get is what's
going to make the difference between you
liking it or not of course base it on
your skin tone but my favorite is this
shade here the one in baby pedal it's
kind of that more everyday coral ish
pink and it just is really pretty really
kind of natural-looking whether you just
put it on your cheek and blended it in
really quick or if you use like a
stippling brush this bright pink one is
just too bright so I think for this to
work you have to use like the lightest
hand of all
or you if you've got really deep skin
and like a bright pink looks beautiful
on you then you would love this but for
everyone else outside of that I don't
think you will like it at all so this is
one that honestly it's not like I'll
never use it I just wanted to show you
guys the color but I also really like
the one in wild rose I will say Wild
Rose is a little more I almost want to
say patchy whereas this other one in
what was it called again
baby petal is just really a smooth color
so if you're gonna buy one I really
would recommend the one in baby petal
it's so beautiful and it's the only one
I've cut up towards the front of my
blush or because I actually use it in
these two I had to pull out of the back
of it so if that tells you anything ever
have I'm grabbing wipes to wipe off the
swatches do you ever have things where
like this every it's a Clinique set of
wipes and I only use them for swatching
like wiping off swatches these every
time I pull one out it pulls three out
I've never successfully only pulled one
out anyone have that problem with like
makeup wipes or even baby wipes like if
you've got a baby oh my gosh drives me
nuts cuz I'm like the only only one one
always spit the next product I'm going
to mention is their Beauty blush duo in
peach honey I love this stuff if you
watched my blush declutter video where I
was going through my blushes this is
like the only peachy tone blush I kept
out of all of that cuz it really was
like when I compared it to every other
blush I had it was like the prettiest
kind of highlight II but still peach
toned color blush it really is more of a
highlight or like a blush topper if you
want to put it just kind of on top to
kind of add this glowy nature to it I'm
wearing it today but I to be honest with
you I kind of toned it down a little bit
just with some powder foundation cuz it
really can be a lot if you focus your
brush more on the deeper color of course
it's going to be more of a deeper color
but either way it's really frosty I love
this though and this is one that you
know I don't know if I would get rid of
it anytime soon because I really do love
it but it is one of those that you know
I love wearing highlight and I really do
not need a highlight when I'm wearing
this so I feel like I don't reach for it
that often for that reason
no that's a really dumb reason it's a
beautiful product it's really pigmented
it stays on all day and if you're like
one of those people that you the less
products you use in the morning the
better this really is a multitasker
where you just swirl your brush and
throw it on you you've got your blush
and your highlight done all in one fell
swoop literally one fell swoop Tyler
says one foul swoop and it makes me off
every time because it's one fell swoop
but it's one of those weird phrases that
you just hear like what was that phrase
when I was a kid it was like
I mean people still say it oh when
people say you might as well do that I
thought it was mine as well like all one
word and then when I realize it was
three words I'm like oh so then the
three words are mine as well you mine as
well and so I still say it that way even
though I know in my head that it's might
as well
weird things like that anyone else have
like phrases like that that in your life
you you never say it right or you learn
later in life that you've been saying it
wrong oh yeah so I don't have any other
pixie products to show you but one that
I wanted to mention that I don't have
right now they have it's kind of in the
same kind of pop maybe a little smaller
they have these like kind of bronzer
shades and I love those the only thing
about them they are they are really
pixie powders are totally different
consistency than anything I've ever
tried and the bronzer was the same as
this but the bronzer like got these
little bumps really easily and I just
didn't feel like messing with it and
I've had two of them and both of them
had those little bumps but I do want to
repurchase it because it was a really
like light bronzer that was so easy to
throw on in the winter it just looked
nice and I love their green packaging I
just think it's so different and so cute
like in my makeup bag I love seeing it
in there a couple products I tried from
pixie that I didn't like in the past and
I'll have to put pictures on the screen
if they're even still sold is there was
this one like just regular powder or
maybe it was even called like an Oliver
brightening powder that I liked for a
while and then as I use it more and more
I realize it just looked so dry on my
skin you could just see the powder so I
really didn't like that I got rid of
that years ago so the next brand I'm
going to talk about is number seven and
I have four products from them I adore
and I can't find the lipstick I've
talked about the lipstick a million
times
the shade I think it's called their
moisture drench lipstick and it's in the
shade romantic I'll put it on the screen
now I love it I can't find it and I just
had it the other day so my only guess is
I left it at school because I bring
lipsticks there cuz I put them on in the
morning and I just leave them there
because I put it on later on in the day
and then I just never remember to bring
it home so that's my guess as to where
it is but I love that color it's just a
normal kind of peach ish brownish
everyday neutral color it's nothing
crazy it reminds me kind of what I'm
wearing on my lips today I'm wearing
NARS Barbara I think on my lips anyway
so I love that lipstick those lipsticks
the moisture drench line are amazing so
if you're looking for something just
different you'd like that a lot
so this foundation I'm wearing today
I've loved for a while it's the lift and
luminate foundation I've been trying
this for months and months and months
now and I love it I wear it in the shade
warm ivory honestly it's a pretty darn
good shade match for me but it's got a
pump I know that a lot of people love
the number-7 there's another foundation
it's like the airbrush away or whatever
I think it's got like a little dropper I
haven't tried that yet that's kind of on
my list but as if I need any more
foundations right now oh my gosh but I
really love this stuff it's kind of
almost got like a whipped texture here
I'll show you a little bit umm it really
is like almost whipped and it just is so
comfortable and like I feel like my skin
loves his foundation when I put it on
today I hadn't put it on and probably a
couple weeks and my skin was like yes
like I feel like it just like drinks it
in in the weirdest way it doesn't look
too glowy at all but it also doesn't
look super matte it's right in between
it's just healthy I would say it's got
low to medium covered maybe more like
medium coverage it certainly is not a
high coverage foundation but it's not
like a BB cream I mean it definitely has
coverage I have two layers on today and
I think it did a really nice job I did
put some powder foundation on my nose
cuz like I said my nose is always red
like all my life
I'm Irish is that an Irish thing if
you're from Ireland no there's no way
that's a night that doesn't even make
sense
but people have always told me that
they're like oh you're Irish you got red
nose my what so I feel like I've just
like grown to believe that but that
doesn't even
any sense why would that have anything
to do with it I don't know all right so
I love that foundation absolutely we're
trying it is just a gem in the drugstore
or at Target and I'm sure in the UK
obviously you can get this as well I
love it so much another one that I'm
kind of feel meh about like I really
liked it for a while but then I tried
the Laura Mercier powder and I was like
that Laura Mercier powder is amazing
I've and I don't even know how to
describe it anyway this is so really
really good though and I want to try
them out side by side to see maybe they
really are doing the same thing I'm just
like in my head I don't know but this is
their perfect light loose powder in
translucent and I love the shape of
their packaging they just kind of do
different stuff with their packaging and
I think it's cool but you just twist the
cap off it comes with a powder puff and
of course the loose powder it's kind of
more of a beige color which I appreciate
of course the idea is that it's still
translucent but I feel like when it's
white like stark white like the
Maybelline master fix one that I have it
just really does like it really leaves a
white cast on your skin whereas this
because it is a little more beige it's a
little more closer to my own skin tone
it doesn't look as white if you will the
next number 7 product that I love so
much except for one thing about it this
is their radiant glow concealer if
you've been wanting to try like the YSL
Touche clot like you know concealer I
have that it's really nice it really is
this is absolutely just as good
absolutely if not even better and it
reminds me of like the Maybelline Dream
Lumi but maybe a step up from that maybe
a little bit better I'm wearing this
today as well as my only under-eye
concealer it's got that same kind of a
tip like the YSL and the Maybelline one
does and you push the bottom and it gets
product into it but it's just this you
can't really see it I don't even want to
waste it because I'm almost out of it it
is this amazing light yet radiant
concealer but it's not so radiant like
sometimes like the you know the
Maybelline age instant Asia I'm ones
that you twist up and it's kind of that
pink tone that I really like but it can
be so brightening and so radiant that
you kind of look ridiculous in real life
this stuff is perfect
so nice on you can barely tell you're
wearing concealer and yet it just looks
so gorgeous
every conceal I've ever tried sinks into
fine lines I have never ever found one
and everything I've tried that doesn't
but this one sinks in the least out of
all of them and usually it only takes
like one time of me doing that and then
it's good it just sets and it stays and
it is amazing amazing amazing I've been
talking about this for a long time and
if you've been watching me for a while
and you saw the gone to Target and
bought this shame on you because it is
amazing it really is so good I can't say
enough this probably is my favorite
number seven product I've ever tried and
one of my favorite drugstore concealers
ever ever ever next brand I'm going to
briefly talk about and then we'll go to
Sonia Kashuk is Pacifica now Pacifica is
more of one of those kind of natural
brands and they've got you know all
these great ingredients all this stuff
or at least that's that's their claim I
haven't really looked deeply into it but
they send me a lot of products
throughout the time and I've tried like
their underarm deodorant wipes are
amazing they're in my gym bag if you've
never tried them they are incredible
because they're literally just like a
baby wipe they're in you know like a
container like this but it you know you
can just wipe it on your underarms and
you're just fresh you're good to go I
mean really you could use it anywhere
and it smells I think that one smells
like coconut they've got some facial
wipes that all smell amazing I don't
really use facial wipes often that's why
I'm using the clinic once just for
swatches because I really don't use
makeup wipes to remove makeup unless I'm
traveling cuz it's just easier but um
they do have some makeup and I haven't
tried a lot but what I have tried I have
not loved and so if you've tried some
Pacifica products that you would
recommend please let me know so one
product they have sent me like four
times and I hadn't tried it because it's
a mascara and I've got like 20 mascaras
right now so I'm trying to try some like
new one so I was like you know what I'm
gonna try this and see maybe it's like
awesome it was terrible it was terrible
and first of all the packaging could not
be cuter it's got it looks like a little
dream there's like a unicorn and some
gold there's like a blue rainbow with a
unicorn it's called dream big it is the
cutest packaging ever I mean really
probably the
mascara packaging I've ever seen I
wanted to love this I've tried this for
weeks off and on and I just cannot do it
there was one day that I was like forget
it and I literally like took a makeup
wipe and just tried to remove just the
mascara so I didn't have to wipe all my
eye makeup I it doesn't do anything and
then it'll start to clump when you're
trying to layer it but I like the brush
the brush is a good shape but there's
something about the formula for me and
my lashes that did not work if you've
tried this and you found a way like
maybe you know I've had it for like
maybe three weeks that I've had it open
you know some mascaras you've got to
kind of wait and almost let air get into
them for a while before they're really
really good maybe that's this kind of a
mascara so if you've tried it and you
love it or you've made it work please
let me know because I've got this and
I've got a backup now oh my gosh I just
realized something okay so at the top
there's this thing you can turn and it
says length or volume so what does it do
to it okay that actually is really cool
so when you twist it towards the volume
side the oh my gosh okay so now I need
to try this again so you twist this and
if you want length it literally the
brush extends and so that but it
literally is like going like this so the
brush isn't the brush is getting longer
but it's because the things are spacing
out more like an accordion and then when
you want volume it squeezes them
together so maybe I'm doing on the
length and I like volume more than
length so I'm gonna have to try this
again maybe I'm speaking too soon cuz
that is so cool and I can't believe I
didn't realize that shame on me because
I think I remember now seeing that on
the packaging and I just thought it was
just some guy like I just didn't pay
attention so I'm gonna try this again
I'll have to let you know I'll probably
let you know on my snapchat which is
right there on the screen because that's
something that I do things like that on
snapchat all the time so if you're
curious about makeup things just on the
fly every single day I'm doing something
makeup related on there um so the only
other pacifica one I have to mention is
their Pacific and natural minerals
that's all it says it doesn't even so
just eyeliner I think it's just a black
eyeliner it's just okay like it's good
use it I've used it a couple times it's
just nothing special and that's why I
don't think you know it's worth seeking
this out and buying it when there are a
million black eyeliners that are
probably even better so I really I mean
it is what it is
you know if there's some crazy sale I
wouldn't say it's terrible but it's
certainly not my favorite I'm really
forcing myself to use that I'm not
really reaching for it willingly if that
makes sense the other Pacifica makeup
product I've tried is their eyes shadow
palettes and their eye shadow really is
nice again it's not my favorite but it's
not terrible and frankly I don't have it
I sensed a cluttered it omits all my
other ones it just was nothing really
special is kind of meth but it wasn't
bad so again if you have a really good
deal or if you see one of their palettes
you like oh my gosh I love the colors in
it it is still a good products and you
never wear these kinds of earrings ow
and like they squeezed too tight but if
you loosen it like it's it just falls
off so there's no when I brought these
by the way on HauteLook as I did with
everything I own ever I literally use
HauteLook constantly every day I'm
checking it because that's where I
bought like I've bought herbs on there
I've bought everything I own I swear all
my toms are from there most of my
clothes this is from made well they had
like a sale and these were like nineteen
dollars or something just these like
regular v-necks and I was like and
they're just so comfortable and so nice
and they're made well I was what must
make it fun to me while I was there he's
like so is everything here made well
what yes anyway um yeah so these hurt
that's the bottom line of this story but
if you've never tried hold look I will
link it below because it's like 50% off
of like tons of high-end makeup that's
where I bought a ton of high-end makeup
and it's literally 50% off and tons of
just like I said like ugh and Tom's and
all that stuff 50% off but it's a flash
sale site so it'll be on for a couple
days and then off my desk is actually
from there as well
and I think it was like a hundred
dollars marked down from like 300 and I
was like sold all right let's keep going
this is the longest video ever all right
so the last brand I'm gonna mention that
I buy from Target is Sonia Kashuk and I
have tried tons of their products over
the years tons but I'm going to mention
just a couple and then there are some
that
since too cluttered just omits all of
the makeup I have but I still think are
good let's start with the product I hate
though you might already know this I've
mentioned it before this is the Sonia
Kashuk hidden agenda concealer quad
there was a huge hype around this a long
time ago when it used to be in the white
packaging I don't know if they change
the formula or maybe everyone was just
crazy then I don't know or maybe it's
just me but this I love the packaging I
love the idea it's three different kind
of tones of concealer it's an awesome
idea and then there's a powder these
don't blend into your skin I have
applied this so many different ways and
they don't blend in they just rub back
and forth they just show every weird
imperfection imperfections that I don't
even have that it's like creating it was
horrible and then the powder was alright
but honestly was more of like an eye
shadow like you could straight-up use
that as an eye shadow it is brightening
I will say but again it did no favors to
the other products in here and I don't
think it's worth keeping this for me
just for that but if you already had it
and you didn't like it I think the
powders okay again you could just use
this and eyeshadow but I really would
stay away from this I think they must
have reformulated it
I'll show you swatches anyway because
you know everyone's different so you
never know I again I love the idea that
it's three different tones I mean isn't
that such a cool idea but it just didn't
blend it just looked cakey and bad on me
there are some people didn't love it and
I think they still do so I could be
crazy and maybe it's just my under eyes
so I don't know I wouldn't recommend it
I cannot put the June Beauty 89 stamp of
approval on that one I have to mention
the Sonia Kashuk eyeshadow palettes
quads ones that I wouldn't recommend
I've already gotten rid of I've
mentioned before and products I regret
buying videos which I can link if you're
interested I can find my latest products
I regret buying anyway I don't even know
if that was in it because I do those all
the time but um this is amazing their
quads are good but they have these
glitter shadows in them that look
amazing but it is fallout city I mean
you will have glitter on your face for
four days whether you shower every day
or not you have glitter everywhere so
it's not worth it and so honestly I was
it's just not worth any of it so I get
rid of it but there are other shadows
like these are amazing amazing these are
so kind of pricey they're like $20 I
think but they're so beautiful this is
their ion neutral shimmer they also have
their matte one they've got a couple
different options these are incredible
you guys the only thing is they're
clearly kind of cheaply made like four
of the pans have just fallen out like
the day I got it I just I saw them glued
them in but they're just like like that
one oh maybe not well that one's like
basically popped out it doesn't really
matter but it's just kind of one of
those things it's like come on guys
anyway but I love the range of these
shimmers so like if I'm wanting I use
these two on my lower lash line today
just the black kind of out here and then
the kind of more greenish color just on
the inner part of it I use something
different on my eyes I mix a bunch of
different shadows I was trying a bunch
of things but these are all gorgeous
gorgeous shadows really pigmented easy
to blend almost all of these are kind of
one shadow colors that you can just put
on your eyelid and go and that's what I
love about I think that's so wonderful
when every single shadow in here is
gorgeous so if you've never tried any
other shadows this would definitely be
one I put my stamp of approval on I've
also tried the Sonia Kashuk blushes and
those are highly highly pigmented and I
just have not found they're really good
but I just haven't found a shade that I
like of theirs because they're all just
so bright or so deep that for my
skintone none of them really work I wish
they had a few more options I love their
brushes now I will say it's kind of hit
or miss in that you need to feel them or
look up review because some of their
brushes like some of the limited edition
ones are not very good and other ones
are really good these are some of their
singles and I love them so I've got
clearly because I've bought a few they
are kind of pricey this is their number
one brush it's a powder brush this is
their number 29 I use it for blush is
just like a rounded fluffy brush and
this one's rounded but a little bit
pinched in so I use it oftentimes for
like bronzer and this is their number
two brush these are all amazing I think
they're awesome I love the handles kind
of ergonomic so it's comfortable to hold
no matter how you hold it
that way it's like people that eat like
that like they're shoveling food into
their mouth I love these brushes so much
they clean really well they keep their
shape I love them for quite a while
every time I go to Target I look at the
brushes and think about buying like
another one
I really haven't played too much with
their eye brushes I play I've had a
couple in the past but none that have
stood out as amazing but I do want to
kind of dip my toe in the water of their
eye brushes soon anyway that is
everything I wanted to mention today if
you know of some amazing standout
products from these brands or maybe some
other brands that target cells let me
know below because I'm always wanting to
try new things other than that I hope
