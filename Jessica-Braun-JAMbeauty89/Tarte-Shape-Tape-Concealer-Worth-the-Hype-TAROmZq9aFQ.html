going to share my review of the tarp
shape tip concealer now the first thing
I want to show you is a demo of me
applying it because I think that that
speaks volumes to how this product
performs and then afterwards I'll talk
about the pros and cons and whether or
not I would recommend so let's go ahead
and get into the demo so I'm going to
use two different tools to apply this on
both of my eyes I'm going to use a
Beauty Blender for one side and I'm
going to use this our teeth brush I'm
actually planning on ordering the
smaller ones but I love the way this
brush and I found a dupe that is
literally just as good it's not better
it's just that it's bigger and so I'm
going to use this today just because I
love the way to splenic and sealer out
even though it doesn't fit as ideally as
smaller brushes would but I love it so
since these are my two kind of favorite
methods for concealers that's what I'm
going to do I'm just curious to see how
it's performed so if you haven't seen
the packaging I am sure you have it's a
huge dough foot I think it's just fun I
think that's why a lot of people
initially like Lulu which is kind of fun
and on my face by the way I actually
just did a side by side of the L'Oreal
cushion and the Maybelline and the
L'Oreal's on this side and the
Maybelline one is on this side if this
video is up I will link it below
otherwise stay tuned but just so you
know so I'm just going to let's see this
will be my Beauty Blender side so I'm
just apply it where I always do just
kind of only in that region might as
well bring it down since I'm filming
today I like to really bring in that
area for everyday I don't do this much I
just don't I know a lot of people still
do but I just don't all right so Beauty
Blender let's see this is actually my
first time doing this with abuse
you
so you can totally see the difference
between the side that I've used it with
and the side that I haven't and I will
say with the Beautyblender you know like
when I look at it up close I can still
see creasing under there but I never
found a concealer that doesn't crease
and I know a lot of you guys say this
doesn't crease on you well it creases on
me but this looks a this looks very very
flawless I mean other than a little bit
of creasing which I don't mind I'm kind
of used to it but wow I mean very very
brightened let's try the other side
maybe I'll put a little bit loose all
right so let's love these brushes this
video is up where I talk about the dupes
I will link that and you get to see me
applying foundation with this versus the
do it's just so quick but I mean I could
literally spread this concealer all over
my face with this brush so I'm going to
wipe a little bit of it off
yeah I'm still noticing a lot of
creasing on both sides so those claims
to not crease I mean maybe I've just got
an unbelievable amount of fine lines
under there but it definitely creases on
me and again I've applied a lot less and
it still creases so I don't know I mean
obviously it's going to create some of
more texturized like any product would
the more you put on and I did put on a
decent amount today but the amount of
brightening and cancelling out of any
dark circles is unbelievable so if
that's what you're like if you're more
concerned about that versus fine line
you're going to love this Wow so that
was today as I was applying to makeup
I'm wearing currently and I do feel like
the Beautyblender worked the best when
it comes to applying this but they both
look nice but I just feel like the
Beauty Blender did a better job because
it is so pigmented and it has such high
coverage I think even though the Beauty
Blender typically sheers things out I
think it was a good balance because with
the brush it really I think just kind of
I don't know like I just think it
doesn't think as well into the skin when
you use a brush the packaging is really
really cute like I mentioned it's got
that larger doe foot applicator which I
like I'm in the shade if you are curious
light sand I think actually it's a
pretty good match it's certainly really
light but I think that's what I want
when I'm using this I don't think this
is a concealer I'm going to use for
everyday just because it is I don't want
to say it's heavier because it doesn't
feel heavy it's surprisingly lightweight
for how high of a coverage it has but
since it does sink into fine lines
anyway I think I'm going to reserve this
for what I really want to look nice and
photographs or when I'm filming things
like that you know this might be one
that I would travel with because we do
take a lot of photos of ourselves we
blog when we travel the price point on
this I'm looking on altas website is $24
is not sold at Sephora and on ulties
website it has one two three four five
six seven times to fourteen different
shades it looks like it stretches pretty
far but they only have a couple of those
deep shades so I'm not sure how well
that works when it comes to those that
do have much deeper skin like sand is
actually well says it's currently out of
stock on whole - what
checking but it's the fifth one up which
kind of surprises me because you guys
see how light it is so it really depends
on your undertone I have in my opinion a
little bit more of a yellow undertone
kind of bordering on neutrals kind of
in-between but this works well it does
have a little bit of a scent but it's
not one that I noticed until I just
pulled it up to my nose to smell it I
almost want to say it reminds me of
hairspray but it's so light it's not one
that's going to bother you I don't think
that if you're sensitive to smells that
this will bother you by any means I
didn't notice it at all when I was
applying it today my other concern is
that because a lot of concealers come
like this I always feel like I'm not
going to get all of the use out of it
and I mean most concealers are in
packaging like this so it is what it is
but in a way this reminds me of the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer the pro longwear
concealer I think is a little bit more
liquidy it's not as thick as this is but
they have a very similar ending result
and I love the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer I just recently got rid of it
cuz I've had it for too long I really
really liked that one as well so I feel
like this is maybe a little bit better
only because the mass Pro Longwear
concealer you would squeak you would use
the pump and so you wouldn't be able to
get to the bottom anyway but you use the
pump and you could never control how
much came out and it was always way too
much because a little bit went a long
way whereas at least with this you
really can kind of control how much you
put on I think a little bit more so than
with the Mac one and usually when I do
reviews like this can think of like a
dupe from the drugstore that might be
similar and I really can't think of one
but what I did want to show you is I
feel like the tart shaped cake is a
cross between these two drugstore
concealers I feel like it's a cross
between this L'Oreal visible lift
concealer it comes with tons of product
I love the stuff it's really really kind
of swatching for you it's a really
neutral tone the shade I have is 3:01
fair very neutral almost grey light
which I kind of like but it's the very
light weight easy to blend but it still
has decent coverage kind of a concealer
and I feel like no one talks about it I
love this stuff I actually like the
foundation as well I feel like if you
mix that with this NYX got you covered
because this stuff is really really
thick it's nothing like the Tarte shake
tape but I feel like coverage wise this
one has a
and covered so if you mix these two you
get this so I kind of feel like you
might as well splurge on this if that's
what you're looking for really
lightweight high coverage concealer easy
to apply a decent shade range few
packaging and of course the idea is that
you can also get darker shades to
contour with it to highlight weight that
I mean there's so much you can do with
these but again I feel like you could do
that with a lot of really good
concealers you know just get a couple
shades lighter so you don't have to get
this line to be able to do that with it
I guess what I'm trying to say is other
than the Mac Pro Longwear concealer this
is kind of in a league of its own and I
get why there's been so much hype around
this so is it worth the hype yes but is
it the most perfect concealer in the
world no like I said it does settle into
fine lines but everything else has it
going for it so I have to admit I was
kind of skeptical because everyone in
there mom was talking about it but I
feel like I get it now and you know now
I am considering getting other shades
and things like that to play around with
it because I do like the formula so much
so I hope that this review and demo was
helpful for you and your decision to you
know perhaps buy Cibola and buy it I try
to stay really grounded on my channel
and let you guys know you know there's a
lot of times I do these videos and I say
guys it's not worth it it's not worth
the hype don't spend your money on you
don't need it but this was one of the
cases where it totally is worth it if
you're interested in more of my reviews
and demos and also my is it worth it

expensive products I will link those
playlists below other than that I hope
