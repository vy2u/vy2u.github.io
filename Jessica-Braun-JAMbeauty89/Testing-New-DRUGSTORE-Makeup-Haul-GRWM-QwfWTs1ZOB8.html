going to show you how I got ready today
with all drugstore products so this is
actually a haul video all drugstore but
I'm using these products that I'm
hauling on my face to show you how they
look how they apply and really give
either my first impressions of them or
maybe just my general impressions
because some of these are repurchases
and some of them I've used earlier this
week just trying out and you will also
see that I get about I get a few minutes
into the look and I end up wiping
everything off because I hate one of the
products so much so you'll see what that
product is and I hope you enjoyed let's
go and get into it I have a couple of
options for primer I bought two primers
from NYX recently this is the NYX hydro
touch which is hydrating and then this
is the NYX angel veil which by the way
was crazy expensive I had no idea like I
don't know I didn't look at the price
tag I figured it would be under $10 I
think this ended up being like $15 one
so bought that this is supposed to be a
skin perfecting primer and then I also
bought a shawl from NYX I didn't know
the NYX honey do me up and it's the
honey of the natural antiseptic gold
flakes increased skin radiance and
collagen for some of their skin now I've
got like these breakouts and this I
think was a bug bite or something weird
so I kind of want to try this honey do
me up one and plus I'm just curious
because I've never tried one like this I
know some people compared it to that
really expensive lower or lower one
I can't think of the brand but it's got
like this spatula and its really drippy
hmm kind of goopy I'm just going to
press it into my skin it kind of has a
honey consistency and it's definitely
making my skin look oily I'm sure some
of it will sink in it has a very strong
kind of clean almost antiseptic like
scent it doesn't really smell like honey
I might put a little of the angel valent
on my nose just because that's where I
got really I don't know noticeable pores
uneven
and this is more like a kind of a
smoothing primer so I feel like that'll
be perfect for that and I might get a
little bit up in this region as well
where I tend to look uneven and kind of
patchy just kind of in this middle area
so the only one I didn't use is the NYX
hydro touch I've used it once before it
reminded me of a lot of hydrating
primers I already have I mean it was
nice kind of lotion like moisturizing
primer so Tyler made this like coffee
cocoa date prune smoothie and I have to
admit and actually is way better than I
thought it would be it really just
tastes like a jamocha shake type thing
but everyone trying to get like a chunk
of a date or a prune on one but it's
actually really really good all right it
is clipped back enough for now all right
so for a foundation I have a couple
options
I bought the elf foundation serum I
think oh this isn't fair like I think
this might be too light for me I may
know maybe this one wasn't the one it's
a very very light thin formula oh no
this is the perfect shade match I think
although I said that last time and it
was not so I might do that I also got
two foundations from number seven this
is the number set an airbrush away
foundation and says to always shake it
it's got a little dropper and this one I
have tried this week and I didn't love
it again it was a similar consistency
what was very thin and like anywhere I
had redness it did not cover that
redness period like not even close so I
ended up having to go in with the powder
foundation to cover it because it just
kept wiping through I tried it with the
sponge everything the others that I also
bought is this number seven stay perfect
foundation this I tried and it was the
wrong shade however I mixed it with my
custom cover drops in a lighter shade
and it was this foundation is amazing
alright I got any different things does
that clip my haircut falling out of it
and really interesting my hair held back
but I'm kind of curious about this elf
foundation serum so I think that's what
I'm gonna try today I'm using a real
technique
sponge I forgot how good these are I
bought a 2-pack actually when I bought
all of this dust on here and one of them
if you are looking to save money and not
buy the beauty blender because these are
really really good the best and closest
I've ever found the beauty blender I
don't you know I never notice the
difference when I'm applying versus the
beauty blender versus this can I put
some of this this is a lot thinner
though it's always weird to apply
something like this with a sponge yeah I
don't know I don't know that it has
super great coverage because already I
can still see like I've got this huge
blemish here my nose is usually the way
I can really tell about the coverage I
am not loving the coverage on this now I
don't think it's necessarily meant to be
a high coverage foundation by any means
it's a serum foundation it's thinner but
today I just got like all kinds of
blemishes and I actually did a sheet
mask this morning when I woke up and my
face was like even more red and like
what usually it calms it down but I use
the face masks that map that I'd never
use before I do not really like this I
think if you've got like really perfect
skin and I don't think I'm bad skin by
any means but it's not perfect
especially today like I don't know so I
don't know I don't think I would
recommend this to most people you'd have
to have really flawless skin for this to
work I can't do it guys I'm starting
over I like looking at my skin I hate
the way it looks I've got to just start
over I literally I don't think I've ever
done this in a video where I've hated
the look of something so much that I
just straight-up wiped it off that elf
foundation is terrible and it's crazy
because my favorite foundation is the
elf flawless finish foundation that
serum foundation looks horrible on my
skin so we're going to start over I'm
going to try the NYX hydrating
foundation because I know my skin needs
it well I guess the good news
is we're getting to try all kinds of
stuff I'm going to do the number seven
stay perfect foundation but what I'm
going to do is I'm going to put it on my
hand it really is too dark for me I have
it in the shade warm ivory and I'm going
to take this and put a dropper to and
treat it kind of like my custom cover
drops where I can kind of lighten things
because this is lighter and really
really thin so I don't feel like it
messes with the formula too much so that
is what we're going to use to make my
face look way better than it did just a
few minutes ago already better coverage
this definitely is giving a very dewy
finished high skin which I like I know
not everyone does but it says it's like
medium coverage I would agree but I
totally think it's buildable this is the
NYX HD concealer I'm not going to put as
much on with this this is a much thinner
formula spreads really easily you just
kind of do a little bit of brightening
nothing too crazy I don't think this is
like the best concealer in the world but
I liked it enough to rebuy it
I hadn't had it for a while I don't know
I don't remember I probably decluttered
it but I just wanted a really quick easy
go-to pretty good concealer you know
I've got a lot of like the Tarte shade
tape the Kat Von D and I like that when
I want to look like as flawless as
possible but for every day I don't
always need all that so I kind of want
to just a really quick one and this
one's great for that all right after
that debacle well in the end I got to
try out everything one of those things
that's kind of awesome so I'm going to
set all of this not with a loose powder
what but with just a straight-up powder
I don't do this very often but this is
the NYX no filter powder finishing
powder it honestly has a coverage of a
powder foundation I don't know why they
don't just label it that way I'm going
to use this elf fluffy brush that I have
and I'm just going to kind of press it
into my skin because this definitely
needs some setting of some kind and I
don't have any other loose powder to
used for this video right now unless I
just use one I already have
I think that definitely toned down I can
still see some of the doing this which I
like that's where I look for in a powder
of
where my dry skin is right here you can
still you know you can see it still but
it's not it's not the worst that's ever
been but that's how it is with powder
always I usually avoid that area but it
really needed to be set sometimes I'll
just go in and do this with it just to
kind of read I don't like moisturize
here need to do my brows I did not buy
anything so I'm going to go ahead and do
my brows but I will show you that I did
get the NYX control freak I shadow gel
no eyebrow gel I've owned this before
this is a repurchase I like it it's not
a super stronghold in its previous so in
case you're curious I use the Anastasia
dip brow pomade and medium brown which
is like an health eyebrow brush as a
spoolie on one side so I'm going to use
my NYX control-freak brow gel like I
said this doesn't have crazy strong
coverage and it's just clear but I just
like it it's perfect for everyday I
don't always need like hairspray brows
you know just something kind of white to
hold everything in place now that I look
like Frida Kahlo let's keep going I have
a bronzer that is the coolest prettiest
bronzer so it's from number seven it's
their golden sand bronzer and it's a
really light matte bronzer and I've been
loving this this week I've used it every
single day I just love it so I'm going
to use this Luxy 522 it's a highlighter
brush I'm going to use it for bronzer
it's really fluffy and I'm just kind of
kind of bronzed up very lightly I say
lightly we'll see what it ends up
looking like but this is such a good
simple Rhonda I mean if you got fairer
skin like I do you'll love this they had
I think just a couple other shades they
didn't have a huge selection at least at
the target out of that next up I got two
of the butter blush I could not find
these anywhere you guys know I like the
butter bronzer but I got two shades they
have plum rose which is kind of like a
satiny matte color it's kind of liar
than I thought kind of grayish I really
like it though
and then I also got natural glow which
is like a peachy shimmer but again these
are both way lighter than you would
think
but they go on really well so I'm going
to put on this one in plum rose just
because I really like this one like I
said it's a little bit more matte than
like the other one is really really
shimmery I love it and of course they
smell amazing like coconuts so I really
dislike this formula it's really very
buttery really pigmented but not too
much like it's easy to work with I just
really really like it now don't tell on
me but I'm going to pull in this is
actually stuff I'm doing a separate
video on today from pixie but I didn't
buy a highlighter this time around and I
still want to highlight so I'm going to
show you this one sneak peek of my other
one my pixie video it fits up all them
I'll link it but this is the pixie Plus
Epson Aspen oh god I don't know this
youtuber saw a picture were cheap
absolutely gorgeous from sorry if I
pronounced that wrong but it's this
highlighter that is unbelievable it's
their glowy powder in London luster and
it says very white yellowish white I
would say highlight but it is like
unbelievable do you see that oh my gosh
like probably too much is amazing like I
really need to blend that out because
that's way too much I think it just like
boom right away I mean truly that has
quickly become one of my favorite
highlighters now I got this NYX jumbo
eye pencil in black seen my friend Laura
who's also really into makeup shouldn't
have a youtube channel keep telling her
she needs to make one anyway she was
telling me about how she loves black
underneath shadows because it really
makes them pop so I thought that it's
pretty cool and I love my one and milk
so I bought this one in black bean it is
very very black but I also bought this
shadow the Maybelline New York shadow in
nude glow this reminds me
oh my gosh of amber rush from l'orÃ©al
isn't that so pretty oh my gosh so I
really want to put that all over the lid
right now just using my NYX this is not
a new one but my next jumbo eye pencil
in milk as my primer today and I'm
actually going to use the little thing
it comes with to pack this on because
sometimes that works better than
anything Wow okay there's a lot of
fallout but it's not glitter and shimmer
so I have a feeling everything will be
fine
I'm also scooping up way more than I
probably should so pretty though
so I love just taking a brush a clean
one and blending that color just up into
the crease I mean that's like done you
know what I mean you could easily use
only one shadow and have a whole look
okay so when we talk about blending well
this just blended from my lid all the
way up beautifully I have astounded at
how well that blend it I just grabbed a
palette that was near me this is the
naked ultimate basics I've done a whole
video on this palette it's nice but I
don't think you needed like round get
but honestly I only have it because I
need something on my brow bone so that
was just nearby so I'm really liking
that shadow now I do want something on
my lower lash line so I think I'm still
going to take this take a pencil brush
and just grab like a black matte black
shadow so I'm using again this is not a
haul item but it is drugstore this is
the Milani stay-put waterproof pencil
eyeliner I'm just going to tightline a
bit with this you know what before I go
ahead and farther I want to take this
bronzer and I have the number seven one
and I just want to put that in my crease
to see if that kind of brings the look
together a little bit more so perfect
I bought two different gel eyeliners one
of the repurchases is the essence gel
eyeliner in Midnight in Paris which is
just they're black I love this gel liner
this is what I've never tried so I want
to try this one this is the NYX I kept
ik black mousse liner so I want to see
as it's like the same consistency as my
gel and cream liners or is it actually a
little bit different maybe more
lightweight so this is the packaging
that like little frosted glass bottom oh
it's sealed
alright that was harder - unfilled and
it probably should have been okay so I'm
just grabbing my Mac 266 a little brush
and then yeah I feel it's not
technically movie it's just a really
thinner formula I've tried lots like
this I never know if I love them or hate
them because they are so slippery almost
they can usually be really black but
they can be really slippery so it is
very black very easy to apply so that
I'm very very impressed with I don't
think it's necessarily any better than
the essence show liner that's just as
amazing and probably a little bit
cheaper but it is really really good so
I mean I will definitely use that
speaking of essence I also reball well
know this is different this is their
essence eyeliner pen and waterproof but
I bought this before and I liked it but
this is the superfine version so it goes
to a very very small point so we're
going to see what we can do with this
wing here I really like this
I don't think this is the blackest thing
I've ever tried is not very black at all
so I love the tip it's black enough but
I have a feeling like it already looks
kind of faded I have a feeling
throughout the day it's going to fade
even more so I also bought this
physician's formula mass carrots their
lash contortionist fiber lock technology
this is an ultra black it says it's a
one-step mascara infused with our custom
xtreme lash fibers delivers an easy fast
last transformation instantly packaging
kind of reminds me of the cosmetic
superhero I mean it's not I guess not
really I'm kind of just stretching there
but it just reminds me of that so let me
brush my lashes out here oh it has a
brush that is all twisted similar to the
actual container and it has a lot of
product on it so we're going to see if I
like this I don't feel like I don't know
I feel like I don't really have control
with this but it's not like clumping by
any means which I thought for sure with
this brush with all the product that's
on parts of it that it will clump up but
it's not try the other side and then
I'll layer on top again so I'm sneaking
in one more thing because this is
another pixie item I'll show in that
video but it's there extra eye bright
liner and it's this like white pinkish
really creamy liner that's supposed to
go on your bottom waterline to make your
eyes look bigger and I never tried it
and I'm dying to try it
now what I like about this I don't think
it is like life-changing but what I like
about it is it's not a stark white so it
can make them look a little bit bigger
but it's not like the most obvious thing
in the world do you know what I'm saying
so I like that
I keep going over this mascara over and
over again and feel like it's not as
volumize as I like it I did not buy any
lip products I am quickly realizing so
let me find something new and drug story
this is one I actually showed in a
recent PR haul from L'Oreal up there
Balaban paints this was in 312 nude star
let's see awesome this color is perfect
for this look right now just simple
really like this I thought it's like
based on the packaging I don't know it
looks like it might be a little deeper
but this is totally up my alley
so I'm really digging this it's not
sticky at all very comfortable
honestly the formula reminds me of the
NARS oh it looks like very comfortable
Wow so new dark go figure
so this is the completed look I really
like it ended up being pretty dewy with
the amazing highlighter and I mean
honestly I think like the winner of this
video is this eye shadow because the
fact that I pretty much created a whole
look with this and then I just threw in
the bronzer as well amazing it's such a
pretty simple color like when I travel
and I know that I maybe I don't have a
lot of room I know that I could bring
this and it ships so pretty on its own
oh my gosh so impressed but all in all I
don't think the only kind of duds there
were was the glaring obvious one the elf
foundation theorem I really did not like
everything else though I liked or I
loved what else I love well I love this
pixie highlighter again but that's a
different different video I really do
like this NYX hydrating mask mascara
homeboy this NYX hydrating primer I felt
like it just calmed my skin down and
then you know paired with this say
perfect foundation I want to get my
correct shade so that I can um not have
to mix it at all but I really like that
a lot the angel veil primer I do like
I've used the earlier
and of course I wiped it off along with
the Knicks honey do me up I didn't like
applying the honey to the up it was
really kind of a weird feel to it and I
don't know so I'll have to keep trying
this out and let you guys know see
Nick's no filter powder I felt like I
feel like it's good it reminds me of the
wet and wild one it's not bad I mean my
skin like I said still looks dewy and
fresh but of course it still highlights
some drier areas and it's not like coal
full coverage but of course it's not
labeled like that it's a finishing
powder so the butter blushes I think are
really pretty and easy to apply my
favorite shade is this one the plum rose
one that also might be worth mentioning
I also bought the Herbal Essence dry
shampoo I didn't I don't need to do it
today but um it's the white grapefruit
and most cement I was just so intrigued
to like I'm buying that so that was
another thing I did pick up but I didn't
really demo it today so that is
everything for this video I hope that
you enjoyed it and I will see you guys
in my next one hi
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
