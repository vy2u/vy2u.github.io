filmed right before this video for his
channel where we're announcing like
where we're going for a honeymoon and
we're we're just traveling to like next
Christmas and just all kinds of European
travel and other travel that we're doing
and that of course since his channel is
travel it makes sense over there so if
you want to check that out I can link
that video below in his channel it's a
shameless plug I don't care because he's
my fiance and he's awesome so I will
plug him all I want cuz I think he is
awesome and you guys will love him and I
got a lot of you guys are subscribed to
him already so anyway alright so today
we are doing the boyfriend tag I all
right come on stop don't really clock
that this and also I don't have enough
blush on so actually make me bless you
anyway you're adorable
so there are 25 questions in this tag
and actually guys III literally like
Clint Eastwood no maybe just one only
when you feel like it's the most
appropriate how about a challenge I
challenge you Christian Bale's version
though so the barrel
sorry this video is gonna be 10 no wait
longer than 10 minutes anyway so I just
youtube search boyfriend tag and picked
a random one of someone I don't know and
because the questions are honest so I
hope these are the right questions I
guess we're gonna find out because to be
honest with you I've only watched a few
of these and it's been a long time but
I'm excited and I tried to get him a new
boyfriend or fiancé really does my
makeup but he won't will you ever do
boyfriend does my makeup
you will know see what I deal with
ladies maybe I don't know anyway LOC
probably she's cute I'll do whatever she
wants and my name is cute without the
makeup on cuter
alright so question number 1 where do we
meet hold on whoa whoa whoa
drop the computer that was most
terrifying thing alright let's start
over
wait hi guys it's Jessica look I made a
bogey you expounded on myself I am five
years old
alright me this is tough you don't know
me
alright question one first one obviously
where did we meet Boca Raton wasn't it
oh my gosh you have to answer these like
some we're being honestly yeah no we met
doing a show back in a former life when
we did shows yeah Matt a little dinner
theater cuz we were the best so we
worked in dinner theater dinner theater
for those who don't know it was like the
butthole of the theater community case
anybody's blundering so we met doing
dinner theater
she's crazy talented so yeah well thank
you but you are crazy taunted no she's
happened to be in town so she did it
she's out doing Broadway and everything
no literally no go on anyway except for
most of its not but most of it is life
so he met doing Aladdin
a dinner theater here in Indy and I
played Aladdin and she played jasmine
and I thought she was awfully cute right
there
that's just it though I think what was
the first thing I ever said to you you
said we were about to kiss for the first
time because we were rehearsing the kiss
scene and you said sorry I have dairy
breath because I'd eaten a yogurt
ironically now I'm lactose intolerant
wasn't then what happened what did you
do to me I gave you lactose intolerance
I made you intolerance of lactose duh
all right question two what was our
first date well yeah it's true well I
guess I would say like we went to
Bennigan's which is his Bennigan's even
around anymore there's a little
restaurant I think I got it I got a pita
pocket filled with maxi chicken I don't
even know what I got fish because I was
trying to be like cool yeah I mean they
did seafood then but now I'm not so
again ironic what what have you said to
me you just didn't like coffee she also
didn't like wine and now she drinks more
coffee and wine I don't know where I was
going with that you you've helped me
grow she drinks a lot of coffee in one
okay she drinks a lot of coffee even
more wine no okay she drinks stop you go
on sometimes wine for say yeah so we
went to Bennigan's which is this little
restaurant because I don't think it's
all right anymore so that was where we
had our first date though I think we
well I know like a couple times you went
like out with the cast of the show but
those were like those like don't count
like went to dinner or like alone yeah
and I remember my heart was racing one
time cuz the cast was all going out
together and like I was like I wonder if
tethers going and then you did show up
like a little bit late and my heart was
like I was like I hope he sits near me
and I'm like trying to like find a way
to like scramble to get a chair anywhere
near where I'm sitting in the middle of
his long table anyway okay
question three where is our first kiss
and how was it we were on stage
dang it yeah you're right our dear
friend who's a choreographer of the show
was like because there was no kiss
written into the whole play yeah but he
decided like of his own
women he's like okay so at the very end
I want you guys to to come in and hold
hands and then you're gonna smooch and I
was like and I was like we were both
like we were all we're writing our
blocking and our scripts we're
professionals totally cool kiss you know
it's like kiss underline underline
underline underline summation XY XY you
write you smiley face yeah emoticons on
paper and it was adorable
what almost also our five year
anniversary is coming up really soon and
actually like our anniversary of meeting
yeah but our anniversary meeting was
like shortly after my birthday because I
went to Disney World for the first time
with someone else that ended terribly so
then yeah it doesn't matter but okay for
did you know that I was the one yes
how when you were cute no talk to me
nobody else had done that up until that
point I mean obviously I did cuz I just
knew he knows I cried like daily it's
always happy though like mostly it
really is just emotional happy-go-lucky
tears okay
first impression of me I know actually
funny enough I thought you were
extremely annoying the very first time I
saw you do you remember what you know
cuz I was with my friend we won't say no
say well yeah nextly not the very first
time cuz actually well shall we go back
a little bit it's Beckett yes first time
I ever talked to her like I said in a
former life I was obsessed with theater

thank you we met you know we hadn't even
met yet I saw her on liner I figure I
you should some but being in high school
or something so we were like I knew we
were like close to the same age so I
sent her an email
and I was like hey I'm a high school
Aaron in a theater - we should tell me
he said you'd see me and show us before
like in the message we found like from
eight or nine years ago you'd message
and said like cuz if yours don't know
I'm a couple years older than him so
cradle-robber the way to go guys older
ladies know more okay
alright I'm not gonna older lady and say
we're lady anyway so we contact each
other before well you would drive me I
can't take it her and she's like okay
cool
and that was about it so that's why I
was like super cool in high school oh
yeah

extra eat and I was like for the female
version Oh fiance and so we looked it up
she was right but he can admit that was
right and I can admit he was right when
when you're right which is quite often
so we're good about that
yeah okay kiss he goes like yeah cuz
you're also we're both trying to learn
everything possible in life ever so I'm
cool with learning new things for you
and my swords I think Ivan looked at the
camera like at all I keep looking at you
is that gonna be a problem I just
stopped eating blood those are all the
questions that video was 10,000 years
what is this so recording because
there's no timestamp up there okay
you certainly ER okay um okay so that's
all let us know if you want any other
videos with us too
I would love to do the boyfriend or
fiancé does my makeup just because of a
hilarious he probably you'd probably be
surprisingly good at it because of
theater yeah oh I never really wore
makeup yeah I was gonna say and I
remember okay this is actually kind of
funny I remember when we first started
dating you had like your every actor
like male actor has some sort of if
you've been doing it professionally
which we both had he had like a little
kit of like some makeup he had cuz you
do have to sometimes like powder your
face or maybe put on a little I'm just
depending on the show and depending on
the venue so he had some makeup like in
a kit and I remember looking through it
and this before I'd ever started a
channel remember though years ago yeah
yeah and I remember being like oh my
gosh this is the worst makeup ever like
it was the work and I don't mean she cuz
you guys know I love cheap makeup it was
just the worst like it was worse I know
I'm pretty sure I honest
think when I got that kit I'm pretty
sure it was makeup that my mom had like
from the 90s it was all dried out maybe
it makes more sense like it was like old
stuff the moment was like yeah I'm not
gonna use this anymore I'm lucky okay
that made more sense it maybe it wasn't
terrible it was just old or dried out
whatever that was so funny though I'm
pretty sure you through it all I think I
had like what two eyeliner pencils and
like in there like that was like oh I
wish I could remember what I want both
the theaters in Indiana which that's
really all I ever did except one show
out east but yeah like every issue every
theater is pretty small like you didn't
need to wear makeup
there's no unless you're in like a big
Broadway house that's what always
cracked me up like even in small venues
we performed in here like pee would be
like oh just me think you need to take
on more of Lashley I'm like no I don't I
literally go on naked face and you'd be
able to see my expressions from the back
of the theaters not that big the
furthest point away from he's 30 feet
okay I don't think I need to like look
like a clown and it always made me upset
because it was after I had taken theater
makeup classes and I'm like I actually
kind of know what I'm doing and so it
was very it was almost upsetting I'm
like thanks for your advice but I have a
decent idea of how to do it like I'm not
that proud but at a certain time I'm
like I pay a lot of money for those
classes I at least know what I'm talking
about when it comes to Theater makeup
for the most part although I'm not a
makeup artist I knew no I knew nothing
about anyway all right we'll shut up I'm
sorry this video is so like hopefully
you enjoyed definitely subscribe to his
channel subscribed in mind if you are
not subscribed yet and we will catch you
guys in the next one online it flop me
on the flippity floppity is that it's
one of those like
like what do they call it like the
coconut infused or I don't know it's
nice it's okay it is not my favorite
it's not as good as the sweet mint so
this is gonna be a maybe as well this is
gonna be a big video of maybes until the
end when I decide this one is this Pixy
tinted bombs there's literally not
really a tent at all to it I mean truly
I don't know it might like adjust when
it's on your lips packaging is cute
which is why I want to keep it however I
never use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
