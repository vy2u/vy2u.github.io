my cozy mug unboxing and I'm drinking my
cozy mug here that I got at TJ Maxx or
Marshalls same thing um that I love and
it was like three ninety-nine and just
got a J of course but anyway I'm
drinking my coffee which I also love te
but it is more anytime so I'm on I'm in
my like my coffee face of the day and
then eventually I get to my tea face but
I always start with coffee
who's with me there okay anyway the cozy
mug is a subscription box that is like
coffee and tea related and this this is
a company that I started working with
them and I use that term loosely because
I'm not if like I'm not an affiliate I'm
not I'm not sponsored they just send me
this each month which a lot of companies
do and I'm very open with you guys about
that but this is one that the guy that
created it he like since like my channel
was tiny he's been sending me these so
it's just really cool and I will just
always love it for that reason that they
were willing to just you know send me
something even though I really didn't
have that many subscribers long story
short and this has a special place in my
heart it's also amazing so and you guys
know I get tons of makeup subscription
boxes and I love those but this one is
just awesome because it's different and
it is something that every single day
I'm drinking coffee and or tea so it's
something that affects my everyday and I
love it so much so anyway it's 1995 a
month I can put the their website below
where you can buy it and if you're just
kind of tired of getting the same types
of makeups nutrition boxes this is the
type that I would recommend because I
love it so that always comes packaged
really cutely and the owls are like and
you guys can see my owl pillow which you
guys ask a lot where I got it I got it
from hautelook and it's on there a lot
whole lips a flash sale site but it's on
there all the time you just kind of
gotta keep your eyes peeled in the home
section for when it's up but it was like
I want to say at 15 bucks best $15 ever
spent Tyler has named that owl say Quan
because it's covered in sequins and so
he says but that owls got some added
to say Kwan and sequin I don't know it
cracks me up every time every time I'm
your uncle and say con anyway there are
always Al's involved in the cozy bug
which is just so cute so let's dig right
in okay the card that comes with it
usually this is white but this month
it's pink and it says happy Valentine's
Day and then on the back it goes through
all the different things that are of
course in it let's dig in okay oh okay
this is zayna's or zena's tea and it's
red tea and this is in the flavor
chocolate truffle now this is exciting
to me because they I've gotten a few of
these tins from them before like in the
fall when it was all fall themed and
they were really good and I hadn't
really ever had red tea but they come in
like the kind of sphere shaped ones and
it certainly smells like chocolate but
also like that red tea which to me kind
of smells like pipe tobacco which I
actually really like that smell so I'm
excited to give it a try and I just
think these tints are so cute you could
use them afterward for I don't even know
what but they're so cute and sturdy the
next thing in here and there seems to be
a wat in here is this stache tea and it
comes with Ruby missed breakfast in
Paris and vanilla nut cream who L like
that probably so this is nice
I mean I'll certainly I kind of like
when you get a few Reina ones too
because there have been a few teas that
I've ended up going out and buying on my
own just based on one that I had tried
I love teas so that is awesome oh yes I
might have this today this is the
nanny's visco d and it looks like it
says Viva chil Khiladi oh my gosh it's
huge I am going to tear this apart I'm
gonna get a refill on my coffee and I'm
gonna eat this with it this is gonna be
amazing
awesome don't tell Tyler about it cuz
he's gonna want some tell her it's a
little pencil Valentine's Day pencil
that's so cute
see that's what I love like they always
throw in something extra that's just
like random and cute but you like I only
actually probably use that so awesome
the next one the the Metropolitan tea
company limited Lovers Leap foreign poco
its picot right
I don't know PE koe I've never known how
to say that one so I'm gonna somebody
give me a pronunciation guide down below
if you know it says it's a good
after-dinner tea in it yeah it's a loose
tea which is great because I've got one
of those little loose tea balls you can
put it in
oh and there's another one oh cool okay
so there are two of these loose teas
this one is an iced wine which I've
never had ice wine I've heard it's like
crazy expensive but I've never had it
says it's got pear notes berry and
caramel that is awesome so that's pretty
cool and then the last thing in here is
this really nice pink satin bag that I
will totally be using for traveling this
is so nice
okay okay this is Old Town spice shop
spoon lovin fudge and it comes to the
little spoon it's got the in great so is
it just it's just straight-up fudge it
says Irish cream so I don't know if
there's something you just try to eat or
maybe you spread it I would probably
spread it on like maybe like well gosh
you can spread it on that biscotti but
spread it on bread or toast kind of like
a hazelnut spread like Nutella but it's
like fudge I don't know if that is
awesome that's like I've never this is
so fun sorry I'm getting excited cuz
these boxes are getting better and
better and they're starting to include a
lot more things that aren't just tea and
coffee but things that would go with it
which i think is cool anyway and then it
also came with this nail polish but it's
Valentine's themed so this is so cute
it's a one wild one wild shine and it's
in the shade dreamy poppy which is a
really it's similar to the color I'm
wearing right now but a little deeper
and this polish even though they're
inexpensive these are pretty good
because as long as you've got a good
base coat and top coat on it they last
just as well as a lot do I actually use
this brand for my white polish if I'm
gonna put a glitter on top of it because
it's thinner and it doesn't peel up as
easily when there's a good base coat and
top coat so anyway so essentially color
I would probably wear maybe I'll wear on
Valentine's
it's so cute Wow so that was everything
it ended up so in the end it came with
these tees and then to lose tees and
then three bags tees and then remember
the biscotti and the fudge and then the
nail polish and the pencil so all in
Auto in that cute satin bag all of them
oh I love what a cool mix this was this
month certainly check out my other
videos if you're curious about this and
you're not sure you want to spend the
$20 per box check out my past cozy muck
videos so you can kind of get an idea of
what it looks like month to month what
the box - how it can vary I love them I
love that they're themed based on the
holiday or the season I think that
they've done it themed every single
month which is so cute
gosh I just love it so hopefully that
was enjoyable to watch check out my
other subscription box unboxings if
you'd like please subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next one bye
okay the next lipstick I bought is
another matte one you see a trend and
this is the Milani matte blissful and
this is one that I was nervous because
the Milani lip sticks up their normal
line have that smell to them that makes
me sick and I had to get rid of my
Milani lipsticks cuz I couldn't wear
them like it genuinely made me sick but
these have a totally different smells
it's honestly almost like a non-existent
small but maybe a little hint of vanilla
a little bit of a sweet smell but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
