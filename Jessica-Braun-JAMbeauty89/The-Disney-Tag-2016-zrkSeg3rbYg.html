gonna share with you guys the Disney tag
and I know that Colleen for mirandasings
created this I don't know how long ago
but I was tagged by someone here on
YouTube to do it and I was so excited
because of course I love Disney and it's
so cool and crazy to me because I've had
a lot of new subscribers ask you know
say basically I didn't know you liked
Disney and I'm like oh my gosh like I
feel like I talk about all the time that
maybe I don't talk about it as much
anymore but I love Disney
my husband and I just became annual
Disney World pass holders even though we
live in the Midwest but we go all the
time so fiscally it actually is gonna be
cheaper for us to be Annual Pass holders
this year anyway we're going very very
soon in fact as you're watching this we
might be there because I'm not sure
exactly what I'm uploading it so we're
going to Disney World for a couple days
and then on a cruise and then the summer
we're going for even longer and taking
my parents so I am so excited let's go
ahead and get into the tack so the first
question on the Disney tag is a scene in
any Disney movie movie that you wish you
could experience and the first one I
think of is a whole new world from
Aladdin just because they're like on a
magic carpet and they're flying through
the air and that has to be that would be
the coolest feeling in the world because
not only aren't flying but you there's
nothing like restraining you're holding
you in so it's got to just be so free
and yet they feel so safe on it well I
guess they would I don't know it just
seems so magical and it's like at a
beautiful time of night and you're like
near the Stars and oh my gosh of course
I also have a soft spot because my
husband and I met playing Jasmine in
Aladdin so I will always love that song
but I just love that scene I always have
these ears by the way I bought the last
time we were in Disney this past summer
and these ones specifically are so tight
they like hurt and it makes me so sad
because like literally I would wear for
like an hour and then have to take it
off for an hour like in the parks off
and on because it just hurts like me and
it's my head that big I've heard other
youtubers complain about it though - all
right next one an unforgettable
experience or moment you've had at the
parks okay I like ten came to mind one
of them was when we were staying at the
Animal Kingdom
a couple of years ago and when we walked
in they like knew no it wasn't the
animal kingdom that we were saying just
said an all-star and we say that the
all-stars quite a few times and we were
saying at one of them and as we came off
the Magical Express from the airport the
person there had balloons that set our
names on them and to this day we still
don't know how they they knew our names
like they said I just can't I they're
welcome we were like like are we wearing
name tags no like what and though it was
already written on the balloons our
names princess Jessica and Prince Tyler
I mean it was the coolest thing my only
guess is like the magical Express they
can like say who's on that I don't know
it was just crazy that was so poor I
remember we Instagram that years ago if
I can find that Instagram post I'll put
it up right now as I'm talking it was
just so so cool another unforgettable
experience when we were in Disneyland
Paris we were eating at this place
called waltz restaurant and it's right
on Main Street and of course it's like
got all this Walt memorabilia and it's
just wonderful but we got a table during
the parade and we receded right next to
the window and we've logged this because
it was so surreal so again I'll link
that specific vlog if you want to see it
but the moment was so unbelievable
because we were like eating this food
and we could hear the parade through the
window we were watching it and we were
just I mean we had like front row seats
up above no one nothing I mean it's just
unbelievable because if you've ever been
to Disney parades I mean you're just
like standing you're sweating you can
never see everything but this was just
lovely so that is it was so surreal it
says the next question is what non
Disney song reminds you or brings back
memories of Disney or the parks this was
hard I couldn't think of any because I
listen it just Disney music all the time
and like Disney Parks music as well and
I really do mean all the time but the
thing I thought of in the morning I
listen to a classical radio station not
every morning but many mornings and
sometimes a certain piece of classical
music will make me think of like music
they would play in the background at
Disney parks like either in the
Hollywood area or you know wherever and
I just like I just feel this feeling of
joy every time and so I love when I
catch a classical piece that I'm like oh
my gosh just makes me think of that so
it's kind of weird but it's the truth
next question
the first time you went to a Disney park
when I turned 21 and it was actually it
wasn't the tire that was right literally
right before I met Tyler like a month
before I met him and it wasn't a very
fun time the Disney part was fun it was
everything else going on in my life that
wasn't so I actually it was a really bad
time the first time I went and that's
the honest truth but then I met Tyler
and it's all history thank goodness and
now I'm Disney is full of amazing
memories um next question if you could
choose any Disney character to be your
best friend who would you choose
the first person I thought of was Anna
Anna from frozen is honor Anna feel like
it's on it but I've heard some people
say Anna anyway just because she's like
so just like sweet and naive but not
really
it won't kind of but she's still also
smart and she just seems like she'd be
fun and kind of just normal to hang out
with and so I'm just attracted to that
in her like I feel like we would
actually be friends next question who
are your favorite Disney Princesses
Pocahontas
I love Pocahontas so much and I I
realized that I'm so obsessed with that
time in America's history where we were
colonizing and well when I say we I mean
European ancestors were colonizing and
you know it wasn't the happy of
sometimes for Native Americans and it
was you know a lot of bad things are
going on but it's such an interesting
time to me that I just I love it
and so Pocahontas is just one of my
favorites because she represents so much
of what I aspire to be and I'll talk
about that in a second for this other
question but the other one I had to name
also is Belle because she's just so
smart and perfect but just a little bit
imperfect by the way fun fact I learned
that the animators drew Belle always
with like a little piece of her hair
like out of place because they wanted to
show that she wasn't perfect that she
always had something a little bit
imperfect about her which just makes her
even more endearing and I'm sure that
was why they did it
next question name is seen or momin and
he does new movie that never fails to
make you cry okay Pokemon is I'm gonna
talk about her quite a bit but the song
just around the Riverbend makes me cry
because it's so like when you're at the
crux of like a decision in your life
like a really big decision whether it's
relationship or a job or moving or
whatever it might be that song is so
important and the lyrics in it are so
gorgeous like at the very end she says
should I choose the smoothest pass
steady as the beating drum and then she
then the second one is very simple she
says should I marry kocoum which is the
man she's essentially being told to
marry is all my dreaming at men so it's
like should you choose all of that where
it's smooth you know staying in the same
job or you're unhappy or staying in a
relationship or you're unhappy or should
you go after the thing that maybe it's a
different path but it's and it's a
little scary but maybe you're gonna be
happier and you don't have to stop dream
I just love that song I love it so much
if you haven't listened to it in a long
time like as an adult you should go back
and listen to it because that song is
absolutely gorgeous oh my gosh all right
what is the first Disney movie you
remember seeing I think it was
snow-white because we had it on VHS and
I watched it all the time and I loved it
I loved it the other one I remembered
like I thought it was the Lion King but
I'm sure I saw snow white before the
Lion King but we didn't like go see
movies a lot of kids like at all and we
owned some movies but not many but I
know we owned the Lion King Snow White
we all like return of Jafar before we
owned Aladdin it's very odd so I know
that sequel better than I know Aladdin
anyway next one what is your favorite
Disney movie I literally listed like six
the first ones that came to mind were
Prince's in the Frog I loved the music
to that I loved the setting
I loved the storyline and I loved the
characters in the music oh my gosh but I
also thought of Pocahontas of course
then I thought of Oh a monster date
because my like definition of one of my
favorite movies would be one that I've
seen enough because I liked it enough
that I can have it on like in the
background while I'm cleaning or
organizing whatever and I'm just
enjoying even just hearing the movie in
the background and like Monsters Inc is
a big one for that Toy Story one two and
three I love them all I also found a
tangle
I love Aladdin there's too many there
are too many Peter Pan oh no I could go
I could literally new every Disney movie
it's terrible I mean that I love them so
much
next one who's your favorite Disney
villain this was hard to pick and now
I'm starting to change my mind about the
one I originally picked my original
choice is Maleficent because I'm reading
the first book of the kingdom keeper
series which is set in Walt Disney World
thal twizz new world and she's like the
main villain in this book and I just
literally today ordered the second one
to come in to read I can't even wait but
um she's just so like beautiful and like
vain and like sassy like her lines are
holy you ever go back and watch the
community her lines are hilarious
they're so ridiculous I love it though
and when I see her like in the parks
like in the castle show I'm like yeah
Maleficent this is so crazy like so I
feel like she has to be my favorite but
I also love seeing at the Halloween
parade at Disney the Evil Queen from
Snow White
she was at the back of the float in that
parade and it was so like haunting and
cool so I don't know and I was a little
buggy buggy from Nightmare Before
Christmas they're all so good what is
your least favorite Disney movie storm
the stone I knew that one right off the
bat and I even asked my husband I was
like what do you think my least favorite
Disney movie would be and swords the
sohmas ii guess so I'm like yep that's
it
I watched it on a plane because we have
it like in our Disney movie like Rewards
Club thing we have the digital copy and
I've never seen it so I was like I'm
gonna watch this it was the most boring
thing and I can deal with old Disney
movies just because I love Disney and I
love the animation of it but that movie
I could not get into I just couldn't and
I wasn't even in the musical Camelot so
I even like the storyline you know the
background of that time period but I
hated the movie I hated it
all right what is your favorite Disney
song okay this is gonna be weird for
most of you other than like just around
the Riverbend and like anything from
openness I love this song called meet me
on Main Street or me me down on Main
Street maybe I think it's on Spotify but
it's like this barbershop quartet type
group and I don't I don't think if the
actual it's not the actual group the
dapper Dan's that sings on Main Street
but it's this old reporting and it's
like a Disney World Record type theme
park MIPS and I listen to it all the
time when I'm just like missing Disney
World specifically because it's just
it's the lyrics are so cute it's like
meet me on Main Street like you're my
sweetest girl and it's so cute okay you
got to look it up all right next one
what Disney character has your
personality or has your dream
personality so I asked my husband I said
what Disney princess do you think I am
alike might not just look like but like
that I'm like personality and he said
Belle because she's beautiful
okay thanks but then he also said she's
strong and intelligent I was like ooh I
like that a lot but and I love Belle and
she's one of my favorites and I connect
to her because I like to read the same
way she does and it was just one of my
favorite movies I need to add Beauty and
the Beast of my favorite movies list
how could I forget that anyway but I
also thought about 9 psycho K dream
personality I thought of Cinderella but
not necessarily the same exact
Cinderella from the original movie but
the one that was the newest one with
what's her name she's blonde I can't
even I love her she's also in Downton
Abbey for a little while anyway
just the idea of having half patience
and be kind and how kind and forgiving
she was in that movie oh that movie gets
to me I love it if you haven't seen the
new Cinderella you should and the
soundtrack just the background classical
music behind it is unbelievably gorgeous
I play in my classroom all the time when
we're reading quietly okay next one if
you could change any scene in a Disney
movie what would it be and why this was
my husband's idea making brave a musical
because Brady was so good
but we both have talked about like gosh
should be even better if there were just
some socks like they have some songs
playing in it but like to have Meredith
sing and like some characters because
that movie is so amazing and I feel like
it could have been even bigger if they
made it a musical I think of how big
frozen is and really what we know about
it is the music from it last one my
personal favorite if you had to get
stuck on any ride in any Disney park for
more than 30 minutes what would you want
it to be ie have you answered this
question assuming that if you're stuck
for 30 minutes you can like get off and
like explore the ride and so I chose
from Hollywood studios or in
nasty the great movie right because if
you've ever ridden that ride they go
through all these old movie scenes that
I've of course been recreated but like
there's an area where they go through
the Munchkinland in Wizard of Oz and
then the witch comes up through a cloud
of smoke and it's all audio-animatronic
but it's so cool and it's huge and there
are so many bunch khun's I would love to
just go back in there or like the
Indiana Jones part where huh and so I
just want to be able to explore so that
would be my choice I just love that so
those were all of my answers for the
Disney tag I will put the questions
below I tag any of you guys that would
like to answer these definitely send me
your links like through Twitter or
whatever because I love watching these
it's just I just love Disney so much so
the more Disney in my life the better
stay tuned on my channel to watch some
of our Disney blogs that will be
upcoming as we go they're here very very
soon I cannot wait and I'm also gonna
whatever I buy there I'll do a Disney
World haul as I usually do if you'd like
to see my last Disney World haul where I
got these and like 30 minutes of other
things I will link that below as well
