share with you products that I tried in
sample size and I fell in love with them
most of these I've already actually all
of these but one I've already bought
again in full size but I originally
tried it as a sample and fell in love
and I feel like this is rare like I feel
like a lot of us we get sample sizes and
we're like oh this is so exciting I'm
just kidding I feel like every time I
get sample sizes I'm like what why why
do I have such a stigma against small
tiny things I know some people just love
their aegyo they're so cute I'm just
like yeah we'll see if I try and then it
goes on my trowel jar but these are all
products I ended up trying and loving
and ended up buying the full size I've
seen a couple of other youtubers do this
um and I usually like type it into my
note like a filming ideas who did it I
don't remember but I will find if I can
find who I originally saw it from I will
link it below but it's floating around I
think this is just such a fun idea so
and a great way that if you happen to
have these sample sizes to actually give
them a try
so let's start with my most recent love
that I fell in love with and this is the
one I have not bought yet in full-size
and actually I think it's sold out let
me look real fast yes okay it's not sold
out I feel like it was the last time I
checked but this is the Peter Thomas
Roth skin to die for no filter
mattifying primer and complexion
Perfector okay there's a story behind
this this I got in my Sephora play from
like last month or two months ago
depending on when you're watching this
and I was like oh interesting and so
it's saying you know focus on your pores
your fine lines your imperfection so I'm
like there are a million pore filling
primers out there but because Peter
Thomas Roth is more of a skincare brand
I was really intrigued to try it because
I was like well maybe it's actually
better for my skin though and anytime I
can put something on my skin before I'm
putting foundation everything on that's
good for it I feel good about myself you
know I'm like okay yes I'm protecting my
skin it says it gives long-term benefits
or aspheres and grande sill ep9
instantly blur fill and reduced look of
pores fine lines I freaking love this
stuff so the full-size of $28 I am I am
planning on buying this let me add it to
my loves it's it's just this kind of
beige color it works for any skin tone
it doesn't matter because it's
essentially translucent once you blend
it in but there's something about this
that's
front its silkier than any primer I've
ever used but in a very different way
it's not like the thick silicon evil
vidi primers that I've used in the past
that I feel like it's okay my nose
everything breaks down on it so I put
this on for the second time maybe a few
weeks ago and I put just foundation on
whatever my dad was over and he looked
at me he said Jessica your skin looks so
smooth today I'm like thanks like he's
never you know what a weird specific
compliment and he said it just like
everything it just looks so smooth and
I'm like thank you and so I'm thinking
through my what in the world did I use
like it's a nice compliment it was this
it was a foundation I've used a million
times I don't even remember which one it
was honestly I feel like it was this cuz
that's where I put it and oh my gosh so
because of that I'm all-in I've been
using this for weeks and I really do
feel like it helps hold foundation into
my nose and these areas and especially
up here where I've got little fine lines
really really nice primer I'm so excited
I've got the Clinique take the day off
cleansing balm I had originally tried
this in sample size this is almost empty
I actually refill this tiny one for when
I travel it's one of my favorite
cleansing makeup removing balms because
you just get a little bit you put it on
dry skin and it just breaks everything
down then you get water you introduce
water to it and it just kind of rinses
off then I go in with just a cleanser
and get off any last remnants that might
be there but it does such a great job of
removing my eyeliner and my mascara and
all of that I just really really like it
it doesn't have a scent which I actually
do like I mean maybe it's a slight scent
I don't know I really don't think this
one has a scent I think I might have
refilled this now that I'm saying that
with the it cosmetics v my makeup
because I needed to travel with some and
I that's all I had so I just refilled it
with this but it's it's really really
nice it is and I feel like it's actually
not crazy expensive in the realm of
cleansing balms that actually work so
they have a one ounce tub so this is
half enough they have a one ounce tub
that's 950 and then they have a 3.8
that's 29 so I guess it is more
expensive than I thought I swear they
had a size in between that was like 19
but I guess I guess not
anyway I really really
like this and I'm so glad I discovered
it that's something I've repurchased
probably like five different times next
product that I fell in love with from
the sample is the belief moisturizing
eye balm I just recently bought this and
I'm so glad I did like I bought the
full-size it's a really nice eye cream I
use this at night I could totally use it
during the day too I just end up using a
different one because I keep what I use
at night in my bathroom and I keep what
I used here in the day in here so it's
just easy to have two different ones um
super moisturizing kind of a gel like
bouncy formula and so I just kind of
bounce it in that region and I just feel
like my under eyes like thank you you
know after a long day you've been
wearing makeup you've been out and about
in the elements I just feel like it
feels so nice and so that leads me into
the other belief product I fell in love
with this is their true cream
moisturizing balm I'm completely out
there's like a tiny bit left I use this
up and finally I was like okay Jessica
you just need to buy or buy like the
full size and I already have and I've
already gone through that so I need to
buy it again amazing moisturizer again
you could use this during the day before
makeup or at night I'm just have only
been using it at night super
moisturizing again gel like but deeply
moisturizing and if you're like me
normal to dry I think you'll really
really like it because I feel like I
wake up the next day and my skin is like
actually moisturize it doesn't look dry
and gross it actually looks like it's
still moisturized from the night before
another product I'd originally fallen in
love with from the sample is the sundae
Riley good jeans it's just so good you
guys
it's a lactic acid kind of chemical
exfoliant type treatment so it's deeply
doing things for your skin it's just
reviving it this is another sample I got
in something I don't even know where I
think it was like a hundred point perk
from Sephora but regardless I have the
full-size now this one in all fairness
they sent to me the full size I had been
planning I'm fine because I've already
gone through like a little half ounce
sample and I was like oh my gosh I'm
just gonna bite the bullet and buy it
but then they sent to me and I like
cried and threw up and I was so excited
regardless I will buy it again
even still when I run out of that with
my own money because it's so so so good
it's so good and I'm actually really
excited to have this teeny-tiny sample
how many ounces it's so tiny
yeah point one seven fluid ounces
because even with traveling like I do it
every few days I think you can do it
every day if your skin can handle it
I just do it every two or three days
because just I feel like it revives my
skin it helps with the cell turnover so
you know the dead stuff is just getting
off of there and you don't need any
physical exfoliant to do that for you
when you're using something like this at
least I don't so I really love this
definitely fell in love with it I wish
it were cheaper and then another trial
size I fell in love with is the YSL
Touche clot blur primer I fell in love
with this little thing and I actually
used it all up
I've since refilled this with my
full-size from YSL this is the full-size
so about half way ish through this but I
fell in love with it originally here and
I don't even know where again I'm maybe
it was a point perk I don't know how I
got this but it's again a very smoothing
primer very skin smoothing primer I feel
like it does a great job holding on to
foundation I love traveling with this
because I feel like my foundation
actually stays on while we're
sightseeing and going out to eat and
grabbing drinks I can put this on and
know that my foundation is actually
gonna stay and I don't need to bring
three other primers I can just bring
this so a really nice primer now it's
expensive for the full size do I really
think you need one bite no honestly I
think that well I know this is cheaper
and I might like this even more honestly
so just depends on your preference in
your price range you're comfortable
spending but both are great so those are
all the ones I can think of oh I have
one more the Kiehl's midnight recovery I
don't have it anymore I have the full
size but I actually gave it to Tyler cuz
he needed an eye cream it's a long story
I was trying a new eye cream and oh well
actually I'm it's the belief one I'm
using the belief one and I love the
Kiehl's midnight recovery eye but he
needed one so I give two anyway um I
originally tried that in a sample size I
remember traveling with it to Chicago in
like the middle of winter and it was so
cold and I used it on my under eye in
the morning at night and I loved it so I
ended up buying the full size and loving
it as well it's thicker than the belief
so I like to use it more in the winter
time I think it's just a little bit I
don't know that it's necessarily more
hydrating I just think it's it's just
that more
luxurious thick kind of a cream if
that's what you prefer so it's really
really nice I really really like it I
still recommend that I'm just trying the
belief one right now while I have the
full-size and I'm loving that too so
those are all of the products that I had
in sample size fell in love with them
and ended up buying again in full-size
for the most part if you enjoyed this
kind of video definitely give it a
thumbs up so I know and subscribe before
you leave and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
