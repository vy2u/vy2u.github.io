doing a very serious video but a video
that is semi serious I wanted to talk to
you guys about sponsorships and PR which
stands for public relations I know some
people have asked just the whole
behind-the-scenes of YouTube when it
comes to paid content versus you know
products you're sent for free and what
that actually means and what they expect
from you and how to get a hold of
companies how companies find out about
you all that kind of stuff or in a cover
today so we're gonna start with
questions that you guys had for me on
snapchat and then we'll just see where
we go from there if you have any other
questions for me as this is going along
wait till the end because it might get
answered but then if I solve an answered
it by the end of the video definitely
let me know below because if I feel that
I really haven't answered enough about
it I wouldn't mind doing a part two of
this at some point in the future so let
me know below but wait till the end okay
it's a teacher in me I'm sorry I can't
help it
alright so Jen hearts B &amp;amp; B says hey
Thank You Jen um you know your makeup
her makeup looked really good for being
sweaty you couldn't tell sometimes I
feel like when you sweat somehow your
makeup sometimes that's really good
because you kind of look glisteny and
like glowy and dewy anyway that's a
great question there's not necessarily a
certain number of anything you have to
have to be able to receive free products
for example when I was first starting
out I couldn't have had I just don't
know I don't think I had very many
subscribers when Palladio the company
sent me a box of free makeup I remember
being like surprised that they were
willing to send me anything because I
felt like I didn't really have a huge
following and so I mean there's really
no number and there are still companies
today that won't send me anything
because I think they want my channel to
be bigger I feel like I've got a solid
base of lovely people that follow me but
some companies still only want bigger
channels so it totally depends on
the company and it depends on the fact
that some companies really utilize
youtubers and instagramers and people
that are big on social media of
different kinds they really utilize that
with their PR department but other
companies just don't and so that's what
I've come to realize that some companies
just haven't used that yet and others
have already started that and I don't
know that eventually all companies will
they might not but it is something kind
of interesting but when I was first
starting out what I would do is I kind
of created this stock letter and it
would be something like um you know hi
I'm Jessica and I have this YouTube
channel and I would have the link and I
would say how many subscribers I have I
would typically say you know if it's a
brand I really like that I want to try
more from I would say I really really
like your brand I'd love to try more or
I might say if it was something that a
lot of you guys had asked about I might
say a lot of my subscribers are asking
me to review some of these products is
this something we can we could make
happen
another simple question you could ask is
could you add me to your PR your public
relations list you have a mailing list
for bloggers or for whatever and some
companies do some companies don't some
companies will respond some companies
won't and you know a lot of companies
will have a stock thing because
sometimes you have to go through
customer service if you can't find like
a PR email or a marketing whatever so
it's totally based on the company but
you can just click around their site
look at their about me look at their
contact us see what you can find it
never hurts to try if you know you're in
a spot and that's where I was where I
didn't have enough money to buy a bunch
of stuff but I really wanted to review
things it's a great way you might as
well try it doesn't take you that much
time you're making a connection with
brand and even if not you tried it
didn't hurt you know and that's the
beauty of emails I mean everything so
unperson 'el so it doesn't really hurt
your feelings as much if they're like no
your channels too small which they never
actually said that but you know what I'm
saying that was an awesome question I
hope that I answered it well enough I
guess in a nutshell no matter what size
channel you have whether it's YouTube in
Siri or whatever or if you don't have
any you could try I don't know I don't
know what they would do but it's
certainly I mean it doesn't hurt to try
let ik Danny
oh good question she said have you ever
said anything negative about a company
and had them stop sending you PR I think
I don't know it's gossiped I bet the
spill did t I do our slept eat here I
don't want to fill it though it's really
good I think that starlooks
stopped sending me things because I
would unbox their star box and I'm
always honest with you guys
so like boxycharm if see they send me
their box but they know I'm gonna be
honest and if there are things in it
that I don't like or I don't think it
was worth the money that month I'm gonna
tell you guys hopefully they know that
you guys would value honesty more than
just a robot telling you that this is
good so I don't know for sure
I really don't so if I'm wrong and
starlooks you're somehow watching I'm
sorry but they stopped sending me their
boxes and I was just like because you
could tell in those videos I didn't love
them I didn't even have to show them but
I chose to because I figured you guys
might be interested in those um and that
was really during like the subscription
box craze when it was all first starting
out and everyone was coming out with
subscription box so it was really big
then but I have to wonder there any
other companies I don't think so I feel
like a lot of the companies that send me
things are really good about like elf
for example all do videos about elf
products and I'll say here the best and
here are the absolute worst and they're
still like amazing to me and I love that
in the company because elf products I
could buy my own they don't need to send
me anything but I love that they still
do because they want the word to get out
about some of the cool new things
they're doing and they really do have
some amazing products but I love that
they're willing to risk that you know
obviously not everyone's gonna love
every product so I think that's really
dignified of a company when when they
can accept that and know that that's a
huge possibility just part of the game
isn't it so that was the angel 120 um so
she was asking how do you get sponsored
okay so there are a million ways for a
company sponsor you
the
primitive simple way is that a company
will find your email so you know if
you're a youtuber or even an instagramer
you can have your business email you
know right in your profile your info
whatever I have mine in my description
box so if a company just straight
forward emails me and that happens like
I mentioned I think in my live video
like five times a day or so that I can
read through and they'll usually say
this is our company we do this that and
the other we'd love to do responsive
video with you guys
some of them will say we'll pay you X
amount of dollars or they'd say can you
send us your rate card which is
basically just saying here's how much I
would do a sponsored video for like if
it was a dedicated video where the whole
video is about that here's how much I
would charge if it were I'm just
mentioning a product for a minute or two
like maybe in a favorites video whatever
here's what I would charge for an
Instagram post for a snapchat post
whatever I remember when I first heard
rate card I was like what anyway that
answer like a separate question about
rate cards but anyway so that would be a
company - straightforward asking you and
the other way you can get sponsorships
is of course you can reach out like I'd
mentioned before that would be a little
bit trickier I've never done it where I
just go to a company say hey I want to
do a sponsor video for you that would be
awesome because then I can pick products
that I already know I love which is even
easier versus trying a product and then
deciding if I like it enough to actually
do a sponsored video
the simplest way in my opinion to snag
sponsorships that really fit what you
like and what your channel is about and
what your subscribers would want to
watch is through different platforms so
these are free websites you can use
where you just sign up you put in your
YouTube info or your social media info
and they will capture you know your your
subscriber count your video views etc
and with that they can pair you with
companies that might be a good fit for
you so if they see that you're a beauty
person they might say oh you might want
to work with these companies and the
companies that they recommend on these
websites and I'll have all these
websites below if you're interested in
them the companies that they'll
recommend for them oh that was the
cutest thing I've ever seen in my whole
life I just saw two friends running from
alt like they're probably my age but it
like they haven't seen each other they
ran from all the way across the parking
lot to jump and hug each other that was
just made my heart so happy it makes me
miss my friend Sarah anyway so don't
match you with companies or they might
say you might be interested in
contacting these companies that are a
part of they're not really platform but
really yeah I've recently done some
sponsorships where it was on there that
was a company that I saw like I did
Polish choice I love Polish choice
products anyway I done a sponsored video
for them a while back ago and it was
through one of those platforms where
they said oh I see you do beauty in skin
care you might like this company and so
then they had had like a campaign and so
a campaign is basically when a company
says you know the month of January is a
big sale on our website we would love
someone to promote it something like
that or maybe they have a new product
out that they want someone to promote so
you can create a pitch and all that is
it's really simple on these websites
it'll pop up and you'll say yeah I want
to try to work with them to collaborate
with them so you might say okay here's
the price I might charge and here's my
video idea I would like to incorporate
it maybe in a favorites video or a get
ready with me whatever it might be and
then they can go through and look at it
and maybe you know a couple days later
they'll look at all the people that had
pitched to their campaign and then
they'll decide okay I'm going to go with
this person and sometimes they'll pick a
couple people so if you've ever seen
like and you probably have I know I have
we're a couple youtubers on the same day
or on the same time or doing a video
about the same thing and and they say
their sponsor because you have to say
your sponsor I mean and as well it
should be you have to say your sponsor
and it kills me when people will say you
know usually not to my videos but to
other people they'll say oh my gosh this
is clearly sponsored but nowhere in
there it says it's sponsored they never
say it I'm like then it can't be
sponsored it just can't be because it's
completely against the law they could
get in huge legal trouble and so I you
know it's just very very unlikely that
if someone's saying it's not sponsored
it can't be sponsored then I mean just
simple did that make sense anyway these
platforms are amazing they help you
create the pitches they're really simple
and the beauty is again there's no harm
in it because they could just say no and
you move on but there's lots of
different companies
to look at so I think that is fantastic
and so some of the websites I like Rev
fluence is one of my honestly read
fluence is my favorite it's the easiest
to use and look at and like see where
I've talked to companies really I was
really good
famebit I've used it's not my favorite I
don't think it's as user friendly but
it's still a really good one
but yeah so I'll have all those links
linked below this is from Shan r6 yes
you are absolutely beautiful
um favorite thing um honestly some of my
favorite videos I've ever done weren't
necessarily sponsorships they were where
I was sent something and I decided to
talk about it and um so I'm not really
gonna answer your question directly I
guess cuz I really don't know I mean
I've just gotten to know some awesome
people at certain companies I know that
I've also had some really really really
bad experiences with some companies and
and again typically its companies that
they didn't want me to speak the truth
or um I don't know it was always just a
nod and that it hasn't happened a lot
recently but you know people where they
would almost try and push you around and
that really bothered me to my core
because I'm like listen I'm creating
this content I don't have to do this now
once I've signed a contract technically
yes I have to but if in the contract it
didn't say certain things that you're
telling me now I need to do like no no
way and it just you know they some
people will push you around and so not
letting that happen is huge and it can
be hard because you're trying to
communicate through email and not and
things don't come across the right way
all the time like three or four people
asking what the difference is like how
or something sponsored and other things
where you're sent like a whole bunch of
stuff from the company how is that not
sponsored it really is all in the
meaning of the actual word the reality
is either way the company gave you
something and you're giving them
something
returned in that case a video now with a
sponsorship they'll typically send you
whatever it is you're supposed to be
talking about but they also pay you
whereas a company just sending you stuff
so I'll call it like PR public relations
where they'll send you things to help
market their brand that typically is
done with the understanding that I the
YouTube creator don't have to do
anything with it so usually and I think
I've mentioned this before if a company
says hey we're this this so-and-so
skincare company and we want to send you
these new products we think you'll like
I'll usually say sure but just know that
I might not try them I might not mention
them in a video at all etc and I would
say probably 95% of companies are fine
with that and they'll say that's fine
what's your mailing address so it's not
I used to feel like if a company sent it
to me especially when I had just started
my youtube channel the first year I felt
like oh they send it to me like they're
watching my channel like a hawk waiting
for me to post something I don't know
that that's the case i think they send
especially bigger companies they'll have
this whole list of a bunch of bloggers
and youtubers that they'll send all this
stuff out to and they might be watching
your channel like a hawk i don't know i
just don't think that could possibly be
true i feel like that would take up too
much manpower wait for but I don't know
regardless I've never had a company now
maybe once or twice but typically I've
never had a company say hey we sent you
this why is there no video yet so for me
I had pressured myself so much like oh
I've gotta do videos on this this and I
would get so overwhelmed with all these
things that I wasn't even doing videos
on what I actually wanted to do videos
on so I finally hit this point where I
was like oh oh yeah I don't have to so I
started using what I said I'd say in an
email where I just say I might not show
it I might not mention it whatever and
so ever since I've started doing that
it's free myself up to do what I want
because the reality is they're not why I
have a channel you guys are why I have a
channel and myself is why I have a
channel grammatically that doesn't make
sense but I think you guys get the point
so appeasing them doesn't do anything
for me
it's like in politics it kills me we
were talking about here where we
live apparently there was some
referendum where they were going to try
and do like some kind of really cool
high speed train near us and there are
these people in our county that really
really wanted they're pushing really
hard but they were trying to get the
downtown area to go for it well finally
after pushing and pushing and pushing
downtown was like alright you know what
let's just do it I think that's a great
idea and all of a sudden the people in
the county were like oh never mind
and they backed out and both Tyler and I
when we heard about it we looked at each
other we were like hmm I wonder who
suddenly gave them money for something
what company what what person or
business that has opposing interest
suddenly is helping them out which is
why they're suddenly doing a 360 on the
whole deal it's just politics
anyway that's what kills me when I watch
some youtubers that that's all they do
I'm like oh my gosh like they'll do one
video a month and it's always sponsored
it kills me I'm like you got so big
because of your subscribers and here we
are we're all waiting for videos and you
do one maybe twice a month and usually
one of the two is sponsored I wouldn't
care if someone did a sponsored video
every single week like right now I
actually have a couple sponsorships
lined up for things I really believe in
and so I know that if I'm going to put
out say three sponsored videos in a
month I know that I have to fill in the
gaps with other videos or else it's not
really fair to you guys and while I'm
absolutely honest with you guys in
sponsorships I know that you probably
watch them like mm-hmm
because that's just the nature of
sponsorships I do the same thing when I
watch other people so I want to make
sure that you understand I'm never going
to just sink to just sponsorships so Wow
long story short I don't even know what
the question was anymore
let's talk about contracts read them if
you are doing this and you've got a
sponsorship I don't care if it's your
first sponsorship to your 50th
sponsorship whatever I don't care if
it's for Instagram snapchat YouTube I
don't care
read it there have been too many times
that I just kind of glossed over it and
then I missed something huge like um we
will be able to use um I don't remember
it was like it was like you soundbites
of what you say and rearrange the words
too
fit our need basically saying they could
take what I'm saying rearrange it
however they want to make it sound even
better for them for whatever purpose
they might use it for marketing and I
was like what and I didn't read it now
luckily they didn't and I ended up
talking about it but you know there
could be things that company slip in
there that you know a lot of them will
say you know we have if you sign this
contract we have the right for 12 months
to use your face your video your voice
whatever in any of our marketing
campaigns you know anywhere so in
honestly usually that's not that big of
a deal that doesn't really bother me but
it is something that you want to be
aware of because if you don't know that
and all of a sudden you're you see
yourself popping up in a feed of some
company and you're like what and you
didn't realize that was in the contract
anyway you'd be I don't know you might
be upset I don't know but it's just
something worth noting really really
really read your contract when a company
sponsors you I would say about 75% of
companies will send you not a script
because it's really not but kind of
talking points and some of them will
just say they're here's three talking
points just make sure you maybe hit on
these if you agree with them others will
send you like 20 talking points and when
you get to that point right through them
pick the ones you believe in and say
those because getting through all 20 you
guys would see right through it I see
right through when I watch sponsor
videos - and it's like I mean really a
company cannot expect you to say 20
verbatim things it's just ridiculous and
the good news is a lot of companies that
are getting used to this will say you
know I want you to say it however you
want to say it you know whatever your
experience with it was that's what we
want to hear about it I don't want you
to do any of these specific things so I
love that a lot of companies are
realizing that the more honest we are
the more likely you guys will trust us
the more likely you guys will watch it
versus being a robot saying what they
want to say but being completely
unbelievable because it's not what we
believe so if you ever get in contact
with a company where you feel like
something's not right or they're just a
little bit too pushy and you haven't
signed a contract yet get out there's a
reason you're feeling that way I had a
really bad experience with the
subscription box actually with two
different subscription boxes where you
know one of them was saying you know I
had agreed to
responsive video this was like two years
ago and I never got the box that I kept
telling them like I haven't gotten it
yet and I'm like oh that's weird and
then they just stopped contacting me and
then like three months later they were
like you don't put up the video it's way
past the due date I'm like I told you
guys I have it got in the box I'm like
if you send another one I'm fine filming
it that was the whole idea and it just
got really weird really fast but then
luckily they realized oh you're right
okay never mind so that was like one of
those things I was like this is
terrifying you know you've got to really
um be I don't even with that you can't
even be wary because it was just I think
it was just a weird happen Stan shil
thing but save your emails I'll tell you
that but I had another issue with the
subscription box company where it was a
guy that was really really pushy and he
was telling me there was no contract
with this one and like I said not all of
them do some of them are just word of
mouth it's probably in your best
interest to do a contract because just
to protect yourself but also to protect
them most companies happen but everyone
saw they won't and I would say you might
want to be leery of that if there's no
contract um because if there's no
contract and you make that video and you
do all that work and they say oh well
sorry then you're out of luck so make
sure there's something you're signing
and they're signing and that you have a
copy of it on file just you hear about
all these nasty stories of companies
that are just like kind of seedy and it
can be really scary so I would say just
trust your gut you know if there's a
contract you'll be fine just keep it and
I would say more often than not my
experiences have been absolutely
positive whether I've come in contact
with company through email or through
one of the platforms so a couple people
asked if a video could be sponsored
without saying it and I kind of touched
on before but absolutely not every
company I have ever worked with has
always said like in bold letters you
must disclose that this product was sent
you for free or that this video is
sponsored or that you're collaborating
with a company whatever verbage it
doesn't really matter but as long as
you're being honest about what's going
on now a lot of companies will have you
will ask if you'll put it lower and the
thing and I'm like mmm I think almost
every sponsor video I've ever done
have it in the top few lines because I'm
like it upsets me when I watch a video
in about two minutes and I'm like this
is sponsored and I don't see the top
line I'm like really
so I'll click down and I'll find at the
very bottom and usually I have my
disclaimer at the bottom but I usually
have it at the top if it's sponsored as
well so um yeah I think it's just kind
of sketchy to hide it you know what I
mean
another a couple people asked how else
you can make money without doing
sponsorships that is probably my
favorite question so there are these
sites my favorite is magic links there's
another one called like real style and I
think I haven't count with them but I've
never actually figured it out or used it
I love magic links that's the one I
always use and I'll have a link for this
below but basically this is a way for
you to get paid and it's honestly you
guys like cents on the dollar it's not a
lot it can add up but if you're you know
just starting out it's not going to make
you a ton of money but it does help
so through magically Spacek aliy if I
mentioned say this brow crayon in the
video I don't like this brow crayon so
this is actually promised I regret so
don't go out bye anyway if I mentioned
this brow crayon in a video and I say
you know I've always got a list of the
products I mentioned below in that I can
I can copy I can find this say on ulties
website or whoever's website I can copy
the URL and then I paste it into this
create links area of magic links and in
there it'll create a link for me that's
connected to my account and then I can
copy that shorter link and put it in the
description box and what that does is it
traps if you go in my description box
you know who that brow Crenn
but anyway yeah blue that brow cream you
click on the link it'll track that if
you buy that I'll get a tiny percentage
of it so I think it's such a genius way
to you know if you're putting the work
to find all the links for all the things
and I know that sounds easy if you've
never done it but when I've got you know
even 10 favorites it takes me a little
bit of time so if I'm putting through
the work to find a good working link at
a you know reputable do like old-timer
Sephora for all the different products I
mentioned I might as well make a tiny
bit of change on top of it so like I
said it's not going to make you a ton of
my
but it is a little chunk of change that
why not if you're getting the links
anyway why not so I'll put the link for
magic links below
but it's my I just absolutely love it
you can also they also have some things
that are like a pay per click and it's
very rare but if I type in a product
because you can also search your
products on their site so if I type in a
product say it's a matte lipstick and it
they if they do have it they'll say oh
this is a link that if depending on
however many people click it you'll get
you know a penny per click I have no
idea what it is but you know what I'm
saying so it's just a really cool site I
really really love it so I definitely
recommend it especially if you have a
blog as well oh my gosh and definitely
recommend it so I think I covered most
of the things I could think of if you
think of anything that I did not cover
ask me below I'll either compile them to
do another video or if there's not a ton
of questions I might just answer them so
look to see if I've already answered it
