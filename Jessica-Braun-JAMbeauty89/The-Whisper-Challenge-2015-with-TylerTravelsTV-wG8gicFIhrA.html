and if you guys don't know he has a
channel here on YouTube called Tyler oh
you can sit no you were gonna do better
Tyler travels TV and it is awesome and
so if you're ever interested kind of
like in well first of all if you're
interested in travel you would love a
channel but you're also interested in
like my daily life or our daily lives or
his daily life
he also uploads like our vlogs and
things like that especially travel vlogs
we're thinking about we've talked about
it before in a video maybe doing like
daily vlogs once we live together after
we're married in a few months but we'll
see we'll see and I know some people
want us to and then we're the ones that
are like I don't know but if you want to
see you can let us know but look it'll
be easier once we live together yeah and
it is totally true so if you're
interested in his channel we can of
course think of below duh or well maybe
well link it all around if I want to get
fancy I always laugh when I watch
youtubers and Tyler I wonder if you
noticed this too I laugh when I watch
youtubers that say I'll link it here and
then they never ever link it or they'll
say I'll you know they'll always
mentioned like all insert a photo here
and they never do it now I'm probably
guilty of it maybe once or twice maybe
even three times in my little short
youtube career but it makes me crazy
because I'm like cool and then I just
wait it happened this morning twice I
was watching two different youtubers and
they're people I love but it just made
me laugh I'm like and it totally happens
when you're Eddie one my team tournament
I don't are you laughing because I'm
getting off on a team well yeah did you
read it I did not so if you don't
obviously this video is the whisper
challenge and the reason I was freaking
out about him reading something on my
sorry okay yeah yeah yeah I get it I
can't no I can't whistle
so I think they can weekend anyway so
the whisper challenge is where each of
us will like one of us say tie though
put on the headphones and I will say
something to him something I've planned
which is what I was hoping he did not
see that I'd typed on here and he
listens to really loud music with over
the year headphones and he tries to
guess what I'm saying it's funny
honestly there were a bunch of people
that uploaded this and I finally watched
a couple recently and I was like okay
these are actually really funny so
that's why we've decided to finally do
it and if you follow me on Instagram I
just posted a post asking posted about
posted an Instagram post asking what you
guys were on Instagram too much too many
verbs and nouns adverbs
I know sentence party too but that
neither one of those unless you say it
was like an Instagram II Instagram that
would be an engineer Amelie I
instagrammed an Instagram in an
instagramming Instagram what I Instagram
ly instagrammed an Instagram II
Instagram that would be all for those
noun verb adjective adverb not in that
order but I teach that folks I do not I
remember nouns nouns are thing right and
participles past participles Oh
infinitive verbs periods exclamation
marks which is it marks or points I say
both exclamation mark points Moines
parks exclamation marks tangent all

like that that would have been fun but
we had to do things we're like we'd be
quad like I would be quiet for a minute
or two while he would talk about
something and then I would instead of
responding to what he said I would have
to repeat what he said in my own words
in less time just as like an active
listening activity was so much fun we
should do that tonight later anyway it
was so much fun and just really
illuminating but in a way that's similar
