late to the party
I'm finally going to review and do a
tutorial with the two-faced sweet peach
palette but I'm also doing a giveaway
because when I went through the event a
long time ago while in December they
it's a long story I have too many boxes
how it happened I have no idea
they sent me one because they ran out of
them at the event so I was like hey guys
I really want that box so does the only
reason is there and they ran out no but
and then they'd also like accidentally
already sent me one so I don't know it
was an awesome accident because now you
guys get a box so info on how to enter
will be below it comes with the sweet
peach palette a cute little peach purse
that you'll never use but it's cute the
sweet peach glow palette the Papa don't
peach blush and then their entire line
of the peach lip oil so I probably I'm
going to be honest if you win I probably
won't send it in this box screw that
will cause me like a million dollars but
I will package it really safely to get
to you just FYI this box would cost like
$40 is and I wish I were that rich
but I'm not I'm going to time stamp the
tutorial it's the eye look I'm wearing
today that I put on using the sweet
peach palette
so if you want to just see the tutorial
I will put the time stamp on the screen
and I'll also have it clickable down
below go ahead and skip ahead now if you
want to okay let's get into my review of
the actual products so the palette
itself is $49 and it comes with 18
shades it's absolutely gorgeous
it smells like peaches if you like
peaches you're going to love it it
tastes like peaches if you taste it just
like their chocolate bar palette but I'm
wearing it today I do feel like this is
one of their best palettes the quality
of it is really good there's not a
single shade in here that I think is
poor quality you know some palettes you
get there's like one or two shades that
are weird the entire palette is nice the
packaging is really well made it's cute
I mean they kind of got everything going
for them with this palette now as I
always say if you look at this palette
and you think to yourself I'm only going
to use buy four of those shades then
don't buy the palette it's not worth
buying for four or five shades or just
because everyone's talking about it
because in a year no we'll be talking
about it and
that's just the reality of things like
this but it really is good product I
didn't like because you guys know I'm
always honest with you and whether it's
sent to me or they send me to LA for an
event it doesn't matter I'm always going
to be honest with you guys because you
guys are why I'm here
not the companies so I did not like the
peach glow palette I tried it and then I
tried it some more and then I tried it
again and every time I thought is this
really this bad not yes it really is so
it again smells like peaches the
highlighter is pretty good I mean right
so there's nothing really wrong with
that there the blush is all right
you certainly like if you're going to
buy this or the Papa don't peach you
don't need both they're pretty much the
same thing it's this bronzer it's like a
glowy bronzer but it's not really it
doesn't really do much you guys see what
I'm saying so I guess one thing is this
isn't it isn't horrible but it's not
worse
what is the price on this it's not what
$42 it is not worth $42 go for the
eyeshadow palette over this or virtually
anything else the highlighter is good
but they're a million highlighters of
slices the blush is okay but again you
could just separately get the blush if
you're dying for that but the bronzer is
not that great again the packaging is
great it's the same kind of nice
packaging as the eyeshadow palette I
know it looks so pretty and you're dying
to try it but if you know you don't need
it it's definitely not worth $42 and I
don't feel like they last on your skin
that long the highlighter does but the
rest they don't really last that long
either so the next thing in the
collection is the Papa don't peach
little blush this one is nice it's got a
nice peachy color like I said it's very
it's not the same thing maybe a little
peachy err than the one that's in the
trio but I think it I don't think it
necessarily last all day on the skin but
it definitely swatches nicely it's more
pigments that I think than the one that
trio as well it's nice again if you know
you don't need a peach blush you don't
need it but it is a nice blush that's
maybe you have a gift card and you're
wanting something fun and you know you
really like this shade it is a nice
blush but I don't think it deserves
the last thing in the collection are all
of their sweet peach creamy peach oil
lip glosses okay a lot of people like
these because they are kind of
moisturizing more of a lip oil than a
gloss but it definitely is a lip gloss
still but I do think that they kind of
have a weird look on the lips like I
feel like they illuminate my dry patches
which is very rare for me for a gloss
again I don't hate these I have one or
two at work in my little makeup bag and
I wear them almost every single day but
I don't think that they look awesome on
me I'm kind of just wearing because I
have them and once these are expensive
they have a really nice smell but I
don't love the way my lips look in them
now it could be the shades I'm wearing
at work I know it's some of the more
peachy shades this is the one in pure
peach it's really really pretty this is
the one and pop adult peach I don't even
open this one see this is the one I need
to try then there's a lot I haven't
tried because there's so many in the
collection and I'm trying out a lot of
things the packaging for this is all
right kind of feels like cheap lid the
lid is kind of cheap but it does have a
cute little it's just a sticker though
and I just peel it off whoops I mean
it's literally just like a dollar store
peach sticker and I just peel it off you
think that maybe like in grey not in the
actual the cloth instead of it just
being a sticker that you can peel off
just saying for what is it $19 a piece
you think that would be just part of
packaging like I feel like they wouldn't
even do that at the drugstore I'm just
saying but so these aren't bad I think
you really need to determine what shade
I'm thinking that the nudes maybe are a
little bit better than the brights and
the bright peaches just because they do
really illuminate because they're not
like a super opaque formula and I think
because of that I don't know it just
catches weird on my lips so you can tell
I'm kind of met about a lot of these I
don't think any of these are absolutely
horrible but I other than the palette
which I totally do think is worth the
money if you like these shades
the rest I'm just kind of like I don't
think you need to run out and get it of
course I'm late to the game this videos
going up late but I couldn't I couldn't
move on with my youtube life without
doing this giveaway because I've had
sitting my closet for quite a while and
I figure why not review and show you a
tutorial so let's go and get it to the
tutorial of the look on my eyes now
so I've primed my eyes already with the
NYX jumbo eye pencil and milk it's a
nice white primer and it makes the
shadows really pop so now I'm taking the
shade just peachy and putting it with a
flat brush all over my lid you could
apply it with your fingers as well I
don't think it really matters with this
shade but the white really does make it
pop so then I take a clean fluffy brush
and just blend out the edges of that
color before we move on the next color
is pure a which is a nice warm medium
brown and I'm taking a more focused
crease brush and I'm just working it
into my crease from the outer part
inward and of course after I pack that
color on I'm going to also blend that
out with a clean fluffy brush you're
going to see me doing that a lot because
I did want this to be a more kind of
washed out look then I'm taking Peach
Pit which is a deeper plum color with
shimmer and I'm applying it with a more
detailed brush to the outer edge now
this one I did feel like I had to pack
on a lot for the outer corner but of
course once I packed on enough then I
just grabbed a brush to blend it out
with to blend it into the rest of the
look here and of course you're going to
see me doing a lot of blending for this
next shade is peaches and cream which is
a nice matte cream shade and I'm just
kind of sloppily putting this all over
my brow bone and kind of blending it
into the crease just to kind of get a
nice wash up there then I'm taking
cobbler which is a cooler medium
shimmery brown and just putting it my
crease I just felt like I needed to
darken it just a little bit more I'm
using that same elf crease brush and I'm
kind of throwing a little on the lid as
well then my favorite shade luscious
such a pretty shimmery champagne and I'm
just with my finger packing it on the
very center of my lid and then I'm just
going to take another fluffy brush and
just kind of blend the edges of that
next I'm going back to Peach Pit with a
little pencil brush and focusing this on
my
lash line on the outer half and a little
bit on my upper lash line as well just
to kind of be a precursor for the liner
I'm going to put on then I'm taking
nectar which is a shimmery nude and
putting it on my brow bone there another
elf brush I really really like if I can
find it I'll link it below but I'm going
to take that and then of course blend it
into the look just a little bit that's a
really nice Sheen to the brow bone if
you like that if you don't you could use
peaches and cream up there then taking
nectar and putting it on the inner
corner of my eye with a pencil brush
again just adds a little bit of pop and
then I got I don't have a lot of footage
of me applying eyeliner this is just a
creamy pencil eyeliner from I think this
one's from Milani I don't have a lot of
footage because I was out of frame for
most of it but then I took my Maybelline
gel eyeliner that I love and put that on
and then I'm curling my lashes with my
Sephora lash curler and now I'm applying
my mascara so honestly you can use any
mascara with this look I think I'm using
here the Clarins super volume and I love
this look it's so simple it doesn't look
like you know a really dramatic eye but
I think it's really nice so obviously I
think the shadows are amazing they're
super buttery they blend really really
well I do wish that they had one more
light medium shade to help blend
everything together but I still think
this look blended really well together
lots of shimmer so beautiful if you
wanted to get more of a punch with these
you could get some of the shimmery
shadows on a brush and spray it with a
setting spray that has glycerin in it
just to kind of really I mean it amp it
up big-time but I do think it helps with
any shadow to have that white base
underneath if you don't like the pencil
like milk NYX pencil that I mentioned
you NYX also as an eyeshadow base in
white that's more like a lot creamier
easier to blend into your eyes but it's
not that white look to it to make it
really punchy so hopefully this video
