have 10 products that I absolutely
cannot live without so here we go my
first one is the Revlon lip butter in
the shade peach parfait
and it is this beautiful peach color
kind of coral E and it has like a nice
gold shimmer to it but it just looks so
nice on the lips it's very moisturizing
you don't have to wear like a lip balm
with it you know how some lip colors can
be that way but this is just a
moisturizing thing that's the idea
behind them but this shade is just
beautiful and as you wear it throughout
the day it just wears off so nicely and
just kind of leaves a nice shimmer and
color to your lips even hours and hours
after you've put it on this lipstick or
lip butter has been in my bag ever since
the day I bought it like a year over a
year ago and I've just worn it out and
this is all I have left so I'm gonna
have to repurchase it and I will
repurchase it even though I have other
lip butters because this is just the
best and I wear all seasons it doesn't
matter I just love it
ok next product is the elf makeup
remover pen and it is just that a makeup
remover pen it's I don't know if you can
see but it's got this little tip here
and so it's perfect for if you you know
maybe get mascara up here you can just
dab it away and just fix it or down
below any where you've got makeup you
don't want it it removes it that's what
it does but it's just so great you know
I know all Mae sells like the little
packages of q-tip looking things where
you break the tip or do something and
the makeup remover liquid goes into the
tip of it and you can use it but this is
so much more convenient I mean it's just
ready to go at all times I've had this
for probably like 5 months and it hasn't
dried out it works just as well as the
day I got it so oh it is lightning out
Lightning that's not how you say it
that's do you guys hear the thunder you
probably can't it is an awesomely stormy
day ok now if there was like a tornado
I'd be freaking out I don't mess with
tornadoes but storms I can deal with
storms they're pretty cool anyway ok
back to this so the next product I can't
live without is the Urban Decay all
nighter spray
says the excel just means it's a bigger
size but um I know that you can get
crazy good deals on these usually
they're in the sales section on Urban
Decay's website but also at Nordstrom
Rack they have these for like half the
price and they also have the small
travel size one which I think I have a
travel size of another one of their set
experience these are made by
skin-to-skin Danai via and they're just
great um you spray it on your face to
really fine mist the nozzles really
really good and your makeup just lasts
all day and I really do notice a
difference between the days that I do
wear it in the days that I don't wear
this my makeup just kind of stays even
all day I just love it
it's worth the money and I've had this
like a year and I've used maybe like
this much so I saw a ton left ok the
next product and I've mentioned this
already in a few videos is my Revlon
Colorstay for normal to dry skin in
mine's in the shade 150 buff I'm wearing
it today I wear pretty much everyday
unless I'm wearing like a BB cream or
just something else but I just love it
today I applied it with the Beauty
Blender and I the video I just recently
uploaded the tutorial my everyday makeup
look I used a sigma brush a sigma f84
around 56 I never remember it's the
angled kabuki it looks beautiful with
both it looks beautiful when you apply
it with your fingers it really doesn't
matter how you apply it
because it just looks beautiful okay and
this is one I've repurchase the color se
foundations this is probably like I
don't even know what number bottle I'm
on I also really like the color stay
whipped foundation but I notice it's
just a little bit more drying on me so I
could probably get away with that in the
summer but probably not in the winter
but I love this okay next product I know
I know and this is actually a new one
for me but I've mentioned it already a
lot as well but there's a reason for
that it's the elf clarifying pressed
powder and it's in the shade light slash
beige and I wear it as my contour
because it's just a light color it
really it doesn't look like a bronzer
and if you are darker skinned this would
work for you as a bronzer but I just
really like it it stays on all day it's
the perfect shade for me so if you are
more fair-skinned this is a great great
contouring bronzer or contouring powder
um just because it isn't too dark it's
not orange here anything like that on
the skin it just it's just right I this
is the first one I found that is just
right so
I really like it um okay next is okay it
looks kind of junky because it's on the
way out I need to get a new one but it's
the Revlon Colorstay base coat and I use
this under my nails of course as my base
coat before I put on under my nails
under my nail color before I put on the
nail polish so this is just really nice
this is probably like my fifth bottle
and you can usually you know get good
deals on the Revlon and I really like
the topcoat - it's not my favorite but
I've bought it a few times and I have it
right now but especially when they use
it in conjunction junction with each
other they it's just like kind of like a
sandwich and then your colors in between
and they really kind of protect it and
it's really really nice
so I I mean I can't live without a base
coat and this is so far my favorite I've
been using the OPI nail envy because I
recently bought it and I'm not really
sure how I feel about either way um so
but this one I know I love so okay
next is the wet and wild blushes I just
can't live without specifically this is
the pearlescent pink I recommend it to
anyone that asked me you know what blush
to get and I just love it it's like 399
I think in most stores maybe even $2.99
and some but it's like I said it's in
the shade pearlescent pink and it's just
this beautiful like um I don't even know
if you can see that but it's and I don't
think it'll swatch well it kind of
swatched um it's just beautiful it's got
a little bit of shimmer to it so if you
don't like shimmer you probably won't
like this but these are so incredibly
pigmented like you tap your brush in it
just a little bit and then you have to
like shake it all off because otherwise
you have way too much I have it on today
but it's a very light dusting of it
because again this has so much color
payoff it's like ridiculous for the
price so I highly recommend any of the
wet wild blushes but especially for
lesson pink okay three more products my
Rimmel stay matte powder I've used since
I was like 14 and I just bought it
because it was cheap and I fell in love
with it and I swear to you I've always
had one of these on hand at all times
ever since then and that was like ten
years ago so do the math this is
ridiculous like it's it's just the best
like it doesn't it mattifies your face
nicely enough that you don't have too
much
Shyne but not so much that it looks
powdery or cakey and I always get it a
shade or two darker than I would
actually use because it kind of warms up
my skin but not it doesn't look weird do
you know what I mean I don't really know
how to describe that but and I don't
even know how I got started on getting
two shades darker maybe it was a mistake
when I was younger but I always get oo
for sandstorm they also have translucent
which I actually haven't tried a
planning on tried soon because you know
obviously you can use that for any color
and it'd be nice but I love this if you
haven't tried it please go try it now if
you have overly oily skin it might not
be the best for you although it might be
especially in the winter I don't know
but if you just kind of got combo skin
it kind of goes back and forth you will
absolutely fall in love with this I
promise you and just love it okay next
is the tarte smooth operator Amazonian
clay finishing powder it's the longest
title ever but it's just this white um
you can't see it but just a finely
milled powder I use it to set my under
eye concealer I just love it and
honestly elf has really good do for this
their High Definition powder that comes
like in a bill thing I used to own and
it's essentially the same thing and I
just use a small brush to get in there
and just tap it over my concealer and if
you're curious is how I use it I use it
in my everyday makeup tutorial which
I'll link below but love this honestly
couldn't live without it now that I own
it and the last thing is my urban decay
naked palettes eyeshadow palette and
they are pricier and this is definitely
the most expensive thing on here but the
shadows are just amazing everything I'm
wearing on my eyes today is from the
Naked palette I have this gold color
half-baked all over my lid and then I
have naked in the crease and what else
smog on my outer corner and then I have
a virgin up right under my brow bone I
probably have another color mixed in
there because that's what's so fun about
these you can just mix them everywhere
and it doesn't matter I think I'm no I
don't think I put any buck on anyway I
absolutely love this it was one of those
things that I kept putting off getting
because I was like I don't need it like
I have
I shadows but I just love it and I use
it almost I literally have to make
myself use other eyeshadows because I
just love this and it's great for travel
because you can just grab it and you
know you've got a ton of different eye
colors and there's
darker colors here over here um you know
for like if you want a darker vampy look
whatever more lightning that was awesome
anyway but it's just lovely and I use
all the time if you're thinking about
getting it and you have the money to get
it I really do recommend it I love it
but try and get it where there's a deal
you know usually it'll come with a free
like eyeshadow primer or something like
that so I definitely would recommend
looking for things where you can use it
in conjunction with things or I know
Ulta will give like those you know 20%
off coupons are like three dollars three
dollars or 350 off of a $10 purchase at
least you know you can get at least a
little bit off or use rewards bucks on
it things like that um and I think that
is all and I'm probably filming another
video today but um yeah that's all and I
hope you enjoyed and subscribe if you
did and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
