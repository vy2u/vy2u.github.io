my top ten products that are all under
$10 and I am doing this video alongside
my friend Candice from the channel fancy
that with Candice and I just love her
and she's gonna do her own top 10 under
10 video these are some of my favorite
videos to watch because first of all you
guys know I love drugstore products duh
sometimes these videos that I've watched
on other people's channels are what have
helped me discover some of the makeup
that has become my holy grail and
sometimes it's things that people
mention that no one really talks about a
lot of them are and so in this it's kind
of a mix of some products that people
talk about and some other ones that I
haven't heard a lot about but that I
personally love so definitely check out
her video I will link it below I think
that you guys will like her we have very
similar channels we both do a lot of
drugstore we I don't know she's just
really bubbly and sweet and she's a mom
which I am NOT a mom but I've said
before in videos like in my top
youtubers that I love video that I
recently put up I am some for some
reason I'm drawn to people that are moms
and I don't know if it's because they
remind me of my sisters that are all
moms and so I just feel that kindred I
don't know but she's so sweet and I love
the style of her videos and she edits
them beautifully she's so professional
and she deserves so many more
subscribers than she has because she
really is absolutely a gem on YouTube so
definitely check her out and check her
video out and let's go ahead and get
into it the very first product I wanted
to mention is the hard candy natural
eyes palette I'm wearing this today what
amazed me about this product was not
only that it was so cheap it's only like
eight dollars but that it's almost an
exact dupe for the $36 to face natural
eyes palette and I actually did a video
on my channel where I compare with
swatches and with like one I'd um at the
hard candy one and one item at the
two-faced one a demo so I'll link that
below if you're interested but this is
$36 this is eight dollars and it's
amazing I think it's really good quality
there's a few differences in the palette
but not enough that it
makes or breaks it's absolutely
beautiful I ended up reaching for this
so often over my to face one I really
really liked it the next product is one
that I have used for years and that is
the wet and wild reserved your Cabana
bronzer and of course this is a light
shade so it's more of a highlight and
this is just a really finely milled
powder that ends up giving the nicest
highlighted glow without having any
shimmer any sparkle nothing it's almost
as if you can't tell it's on and I'm
gonna apply some more right now I'm
wearing it today right here and it just
looks like a really luminous but nothing
kind of in-your-face
but just a luminous glow it's kind of
one of those things where you look at
someone that's got something like this
on and you're like oh like what are they
wearing like what is it on their skin
that's making them look so nice but not
like glittery and it's not like a stripe
of highlight or anything like that it is
so perfect I absolutely think this is a
really good dupe for the hourglass shade
from their palette in this I don't know
which one it is
I think it's dim light or maybe it's
radiant light but it's this one here
that doesn't have a ton of shimmer or
anything it's just again a finely milled
kind of gray tone powder that looks
beautiful in those strategic places this
is even something that you could dust
all over your face like you would with
these finishing powders I loved it so
much and it's like 399 my next one I'm
kind of cheating I've got two products
and they're both from hard candy and I'm
I had 11 and these were both separate
I'm like oh they're so similar these are
the hard candy baked products and this
is the hard candy bronzer highlighter
intiki and a lot of people talked about
this one for good reason I finally just
recently bought it and it's this
unbelievably gorgeous kind of golden
highlight and the thing about it is it
doesn't like I've got my Mac soft and
gentle on products like that that are
beautiful and glittery and shimmery but
sometimes you can get too much this is
something that as long as you're not
going crazy with it
it always looks perfect it always looks
perfect and I was so torn today between
which one I wanted to wear but I went
with this one just because it's the bomb
so is this one though I think it is
amazing and you can buy
at Walmart and I'm this is something
that I can tell you right now if I ran
out of this I would go buy it again and
again and again I love it the other hard
candy product I wanted to mention which
is part of number three is their what is
it called their ombre baked blush and
punch and there's two different shades
there's punch and then there's another
one I think it's called like sunburst
and that one's a little bit deeper or a
brighter I don't remember but this one I
like the best because it was like a
lighter pink and that's usually what I
gravitate towards I'm wearing it today
it's got some shimmer in it and I just
swirl it all together it's this gorgeous
shimmery pink and it's so light you can
tell but when you apply it it can oh my
gosh like I just love this blush I love
it so much I end up I'm like forcing
myself to use other blushes because I
can't stop using this I literally can't
I can link the hall where I hauled a lot
of these hard candy products and a bunch
of other drugstore below if you're
interested in seeing all the other
things I got the next one I actually
just filled in a review for today and
I'm not sure if if I don't think it'll
be up yet that it will be up soon and
this is the $3 NYC smooth skin loose
face powder in translucent and I'm
wearing this today just in my t-zone and
this is amazing at mattifying your face
but not so much that you look like a
porcelain doll because I don't really
like that look on myself but more so
that you it soaks up excess oil but it
still let your skin breathe like it
still gives you kind of a bit of a dewy
look or at least kind of more of a
radiant look but there's no glitter no
shimmer it's I mean it's a matte loose
powder but it just does a great job of
kind of bridging the gap between
something crazy mattifying and then
something that that's a powder that just
doesn't work it's right in between and I
love it I reach for this over my really
expensive
bye-bye pores from it cosmetics and all
kinds of other things this is my
favorite the next product I'm wearing
most of these on my face today which of
course I did intentionally so I think
every I'm wearing everything so far
except for this hard candy highlighter
I'm not wearing today so my next
favorite these are my favorite drugstore
lipsticks these are the Revlon ones and
they're super lustrous line they have
like cream formula matte formula
lustrous formula I mean they've got
quite a few and then if you've ever
really
I feel like I always overlooked it for
years because you see all of these and
there's just tons but there are so many
options it's unbelievable and some of
these colors have been around forever
decades and decades I think it's so cool
because that just shows how long these
have withstood the test of time like
they've never needed to redo this whole
line like it is just amazing the way it
is and two of my favorites are Primrose
which is what I'm wearing today it's
kind of a nice baby
pink color but it's a little more
wearable than a lot of the baby Pink's
that are out there I think and then the
next one I love which I've mentioned
recently on my channel is pink in the
afternoon and it's got a little more of
a deeper tone to it but again just as
wearable for every day I love these so
much I actually had quite a few more but
I got rid of them recently because I'd
had them for a long time but I want to
go back out and maybe do a true review
on these because no one talks about them
because they've been around forever but
they are amazing and I want to get quite
a few more shades and the packaging is
so classic to me like it's classic
Hollywood just black with the gold and
then there's the gold not feral but like
bullet casing it's just so classic
lipstick to me I love these so much the
next thing I wanted to mention is a lot
more practical than all of these and
this is the CEO Bigelow my favorite
night bomb this is a lip balm that's
meant to be used obviously at night like
before you go to bed and it's a really
nice thick luxurious lip balm and it's
like maybe six or seven dollars at Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works and anywhere else online
you can buy CEO Bigelow I actually have
them my favorite lip balm which is like
the day version it's actually bigger but
I've noticed that this I love the smell
it's kind of a nice like vanilla II
smell but it kind of dries my lips out
and this one is amazing I end up using
it in the morning when I first wake up
just to really moisturize my lips I used
it this morning while getting ready and
then throughout the day I need to buy
just like three of these to have one in
my car one of my purse one of my nights
and one of my I need to buy like a
million but a lot of times the Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works will do they're like buy two
get one free or buy two get two free and
I think I might do that the next
they do something like that and just buy
a bunch of these so this one was kind of
a letdown for me but this one is
absolutely amazing I use it every single
day constantly the next thing I just did
a demo and review and I'm wearing on my
eyebrows today it's the elf essential
instant lift eyebrow pencil and I'm
wearing natural brown and they have two
other shades taupe and then deep brown
but I'm wearing it on my brows today
this is the only drugstore pencil I
found that actually doesn't pull red on
my eyes that's actually a similar shade
to what I want and I actually like this
the actual pencil is thicker than most
eyebrow pencils are like I love my
Anasazi brow is but this was thicker
which i think is kind of nicer because
it's a little easier to work with in a
way I don't know why but it really is to
me and then these fully on the other
side is much bigger than most brow
pencils come with but again I kind of
like it it really gets in there and you
can still use the tip to brush through
but again I have a demo of this I can
link I know I'm mentioning that for all
these but there's a reason I've demo
unreviewed most of these products it's
because I love them and I want to share
it with you guys so anything I've
reviewed I will link below this is
amazing if you're looking for a brow
pencil these are two dollars you can't
even go wrong it's two bucks even if you
hate it I mean it was two bucks it's
like nothing this is my favorite
drugstore foundation it is the Rimmel
lasting finish 25 hour foundation and
I'm wearing it in the shade 100 ivory
today this is probably what I'll wear on
my wedding day I've got to figure out
though it's got an SPF of 20 which is
great for every day but it might have a
flashback so I need to check that but
this pump I actually got from a website
called Beauty MP comm they sell a few
different pumps for different
foundations that they sell like I bought
one for Revlon Colorstay
and they sell the NARS sheer glow pump
and they're like 5 bucks so it's not too
bad and worth it to me because I'm using
this everyday and I was tired of dumping
it out I know that in the UK they come
with pumps I wish I don't know why the
US I don't have any way this foundation
is amazing I actually have two different
change I went and bought one and I fell
in love with it when I did my demo but
it's a little bit deeper than my skin
tone the
is 101 classic ivory so then I went back
and got 100 and these I mean I can wear
either one it's actually more of the
undertone that's different
this I think the 100 is a little more
almost grayish yellowish tone and this
one's a little bit warmer so anyway I
think these are absolutely amazing
they're so cheap even for a drugstore
foundation they're cheap they're like
$5.99 maybe $6.99 so I can't recommend
this enough it just gives such a
flawless I think high coverage finish
and I just apply it with my fingers I
found that I like this one best
just apply with my fingers it's so
smooth and it feels so light and yet it
covers so much I've got a lot of
hyperpigmentation and freckles and it
covers things so beautifully oh my gosh
it's like the most flawless foundation
I've ever used and I've used a lot of
high-end ones too and this is still my
favorite the next one I wanted to
mention is a lip liner which I'm also
wearing today under that Revlon one and
this is the Rimmel exaggerate full color
lip liner in East End snob
now I recently hauled this and then I
even more recently hauled the another
similar shade in enchantment and it's
just a little bit deeper than this but I
love East End snob because it's for me
it's almost exactly my lip color but you
can fill in your lips and it makes them
look beautiful and and plump and and
matte but it also is unbelievably
amazing at just lining your lips or
filling in it and then putting a
lipstick on top which is what I did and
I think that what's cool about this lip
liner is the shape of it it's a little
bit thicker and it's actually shaped
like that like a lipstick would be
instead of like a classic pencil is and
I think that is really really cool and
useful I feel like they can get the
corners of my mouth a little bit better
with this shape you last thing I'm going
to talk about number 10 matte like
number 11 is my L'Oreal voluminous
mascara now I'm actually not wearing
this today because I also filmed a
review while I was getting ready of this
YSL one which I got for free I would
never spend $32 on this although now
that I reviewed it I might because it's
amazing and I hate that it is because
it's so expensive but a very very
similar mascara to that is the L'Oreal
which I have loved for years it's got a
really perfectly shaped natural bristle
brush and they sell this in waterproof
and non waterproof and they sell one
with ones with curved brushes but this
is the non waterproof straight brush in
black and it just it does such an
amazing job of not only being black and
adding volume and adding length but it
also actually holds the curl even the
non waterproof actually holds the curl
all day most mascaras that I've used I
love the way they look when I first
apply them but then they totally look
different by the end of the day it looks
like I didn't even dry but this is
amazing and you don't even have to like
I feel like waterproof versions and most
mascaras will hold the curl but to get a
non waterproof one that still holds it
is amazing so I can't recommend this
highly enough
I bought probably like 25 of these in my
lifetime so those for all of my top ten
under ten dollar products if you're
interested in me doing maybe a top 10 or
worst 10 under 10 or like a worst
drugstore products have a video because
as I was looking through my makeup
collection and picking out my absolute
favorites I saw a ton of things that I'm
like oh my gosh but remember how bad
this was and oh my gosh Mira how bad
this was so I think it might be fun I
don't know that I would have ten but I
have quite a few that I would love to
share with you guys that I think are
just terrible that you should stay away
from but I like the idea of keeping it
just to the drugstore once for one video
and maybe doing a separate high-end one
that I regret I don't know so let me
know if you'd be interested in me doing
a video like that if you enjoyed this

all of these products that's why I'm
