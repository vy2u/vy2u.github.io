gonna share with you 10 products that I
think deserve more height I would say
this video is about half drugstore half
high-end so I'm gonna do the drugstore
at the beginning and then we'll finish
off with the high-end products these are
all products that I feel like I don't
really hear a lot about especially here
in this youtube world that many of us
kind of live and breathe in like I watch
videos all the time like all day long
okay I wish it was all day long when I
go from work all night long yeah anyway
um and I just feel like they deserve
more love now it's not to say that no
one has ever talked about these products
obviously some of these there are
youtubers talking about but I feel like
they haven't really been hyped up as
much as they deserve where has there
been other products that are maybe hyped
up more than they deserve let me know if
you'd like to see a video about that if
you enjoy this kind of video subscribe
if you would I hope you'll give it a
thumbs up and hit that notification bell
so that you are notified when I upload
new videos let's go ahead get into it
one product that I feel like doesn't get
enough love is from all May first of all
that's a brand that doesn't get enough
love I used to love there there's like a
white mascara this isn't the product I'm
talking about it was like a white
mascara it was a mascara the tube was
why it's called like there one coat they
still have it and I want to try it again
and see if I love it as much I loved
that stuff anyway this is the all May
instant glow highlighting duo and so on
one side it's in the shade 100 soft glow
and on one side it's got a doe foot
applicator with a liquid highlight in it
can use the other it goes and the other
side has like a stick so there are very
very similar shades but the reason I
think this product is so good is because
it you can get a really soft glow with
the liquid one by just putting a few
dots right there taking your finger or
your sponge and just kind of patting it
in and it just gives you this gorgeous
glow and it's a little bit more subtle
whereas the like you can see that's the
subtle glow there this is the cream the
kind of stick and I feel like with that
the way I'll apply it is I'll usually do
that with my fingers I'll just get a
little bit on my finger and tap it in
the spots I want and I just feel like
it's so
soft and pretty and especially if you
have dry skin or aging skin a lot of us
have like crow's feet and you know
wrinkles and stuff especially in this
region where we're putting highlighter
and many highlighters especially powder
highlighters can really accentuate any
texture you have on your skin anything
you might want to mask its accentuating
it's drawing you know literally light to
it and the attention to it so but with
products like this especially this one
especially the liquid side I feel like
it's so like soft and it melts into your
skin it just looks natural and pretty
and I'm so surprised not many people
talk about this
I had another shade I really like to but
this was the one I've really been
reaching for a lot mostly because of my
skin tone but they do have I know at
least one other shade maybe two but
definitely we're checking out another
drugstore product worth checking out is
from flower beauty now I know these are
typically sold at Walmart but a lot of
you guys were like no they're being
pulled out of my Walmart I'm like what I
know you can definitely buy them online
but I'm pretty sure they're still
available at Walmart and if you can't
you could order it on Walmart's website
either way I'll find links for these
these are their flower pots powder
blushes these are so amazing I'm wearing
one of these today this isn't the one
I'll show you in a sec this is peach
Primrose this is gorgeous peach shade
these are super pigmented but they look
so pretty on the skin I kind of blended
that so you could see what it actually
would look like on your cheek maybe a
little less pigmented than that so
pretty and I think I like these because
not only are they pretty but they wear a
really long time and I think even the
packaging this is the one I'm wearing on
my cheeks today it's more of a pink tone
called sweet pea and I just think these
are they're doing blushes right some
blushes I'll swatch them and I'm like
wow amazing pigment this is crazy but
then when I put it on I'm like oh this
is crazy
like it's too much and I'm just so bad
about that like I tap my brush off
whatever but I'll still put it on the
mic glue but this I never feel like I'm
like huh too much like it always just
looks really really nice and it stays
that way all day long and they're enix
so definitely definitely recommend these
by the way all of these have the shhh
chan beauty 89 stamp of approval I
figured you'd get annoyed if I did that
for every single product but all of
these do these are products I absolutely
would recommend to close friends family
you guys everyone I absolutely adore all
of these products so another product
that I've recently fallen in love with
is the ultimate e matte eye primer in
nude this is a better primer than so
many high-end expensive primers I've
used for my eye so you know when you put
this on before you put on eyeshadow this
is kind of a base shade it definitely
cancels out a little bit of
discoloration which I appreciate it kind
of turns out to be a little grayish but
for some reason it really really works
like I can't really describe it on that
it just works I'm not a hundred percent
sure how many shades like if they have
darker shades if you've got deeper skin
tones I would hope they do so I'll see
if I can find that and link that below
too but it really does an amazing job
it's a matte eye primer it really is
matte and so I think that's great if
you've got oily eyelids now keep in mind
I don't have a eyelids so I don't know
how this reacts to that if you do have
oily eyelids and you have tried this let
us know your experience below and if you
see someone commented thumbs it up so it
gets its way to the top so anyone that's
curious can find out the next product is
what I'm wearing on my lips this is from
Revlon it's their Ultra HD altro I said
that so like flawlessly usually I say
Ultra try that time I said ultra Oh
careful why anyway their ultra HD matte
lip color metallic so it's a matte lip
color but it's metallic so I was like
Revlon what are you trying to pull on us
metallic and man that doesn't make any
sense and that always drives me nuts
with other products make a little more
of a ruckus buddy no makeup trash a boy
listened good boy
it's Pinocchio by the way of course okay
you just hit whitetail volley good boy
we're all so weird all of us with
animals we put on our fake voices and
talk to them and we are also weird
so this stuff blew me away it's what I
have on my lips today and it's all I
have I do have lip liner on I put like a
really expensive oh no it's like
Charlotte Tilbury like their pillow talk
one that's really close it but it's so
pretty I put that one on but that's it I
didn't fill in my lips with that just
this is what's on my lips it's in the
shade HD gleam I have been reaching for
this so much because it's got like a
matte feel to it like it's not a super
sticky lip gloss but it's not super dry
like a matte liquid lip color thank
goodness but it really does have like
this like kind of shimmery it's not
glitter but it's definitely shimmer in
it I love it so much it doesn't make my
lips look like healthy and it's like the
perfect lip color for many people
Pinnochio it's amazing and so I feel
like it's got a really flat dough fit up
okay which I appreciate it does have a
smell like a kind of fruity smell you
know like a fake fruit smell but I
really like it I need to try more of
their shades but this is the one shade
very specifically that I am like why is
everyone not talking about this line why
is everyone not talking about this color
I love it I love it so much
it's like an all-in-one lip color that
just looks so nice especially if you
know this metallic trend that's coming
in is fun and I like looking at it on
other people but I don't love it on
myself every single time but this is
like the perfect amount of metallic can
we feel so brokenhearted when I kick
Pinocchio out and he just looks back at
me in the dark of the hallway like like
I'm sorry just go downstairs go see dad
anyway okay next product from the
drugstore that I really feel like more
people should be talking about is this
pixie lower lash mascara I I use this a
on my lower lashes I've been using like
everyday because I love my lash paradise
but it's not great for lower lashes it's
a lot this is so similar to so many high
end
versions of this like there's like that
isn't there Clinique one there's the it
cosmetics one that's really thin that I
really do like oh it's called their
tight line mascara this is the exact
same thing for half the price
now pixie is kind of borderline it's
like it is drug source at Target but
some of their prices are a little bit
like like kind of creeping up so I don't
know if I consider this one drugstore
not but this is one of their more
inexpensive products it's just amazing
it's because it's like literally almost
a non-existent wand you just can really
like I don't know like flawlessly get
your bottom lashes no clumps like it's
not getting all over your skin it
deposits the perfect amount of product I
love it also this lasts way longer than
three months like I'm talking I've been
using this for quite a while so I mean I
feel like it's one of those things cuz
it is a I mean it's still a mascara but
it is a little bit different it just is
lasting a very long time moving along
another product I can't believe more
people are talking about we're getting
more into the more expensive products is
this it cosmetics bye bye lines
foundation this stuff this was sent to
me a while ago and I've kind of I had
been trying it off and on but I started
to realize that a lot of the times I
look in the mirror like at work and be
like ooh like your skin looks really
nice today like Saint Jess you've been
drinking a lot of water and I realize it
was always when I was wearing this it's
an anti-aging they say anti-aging skin
smoothing and visible coverage I feel
like it's got nice medium coverage maybe
medium to full and it just is so pretty
now if you have oily skin you will hate
this this is for my dry skin gals it is
so pretty
it's so like your skin just looks
invigorated and youthful and dewy and
glowy
but like covered I feel like a lot of
dewy foundations I've used don't have
the coverage I need but this one has
both and that's why I'm like why is no
one talking about this is crazy
so I really like it but like I said dry
skin people probably only maybe combo
but oily I don't even know but either
way I am I love it so much
and
again this is pixie but because it's a
pallet it is more expensive so I'm kind
of including it later in this video is
the pixie and it's shootie time get the
look pallet in its eye time this pallet
is unbelievable I want to say it's
around $20 I'll put the price on the
screen because I'm not 100% sure but
when you start thinking about comparing
this to like 50 and $60 pallets that are
out there this is definitely just as
good if not better
very similar colors to what's out there
in like every single pallet very popular
you know the Reds the warm tones
it's got matte and shimmer it's gorgeous
so let me swatch some of this for you
the shimmers are freaking unbelievable
there is a little bit of powder kick up
but if you tap your brush off you're
gonna be fine
so look at those are you Seri are you
Cyrus and then the mattes oh my gosh I'm
wearing some of these shades today I'll
tell you in just a second which ones of
course my sleeves gonna get on it
gorgeous stunning these I'm wearing this
red that I just watched right there in
my like outer corner increase I think
that actually I think that oh and I put
that on my lower lash in so I guess
that's all I'm wearing I was trying a
few other things out too today but I
love this palette so much this is one of
these that every time I use it I always
have a good eye shadow day I always do
and I think it's because they blend
really well they're not crazy thick but
they're not too thin of a shadow they're
pigmented but not so pigmented that
they're like kind of hard to work with
but like I said there is a little powder
kick up on just the shimmer so you
always want to tap but unbelievable and
I actually think the packaging it's kind
of cute this is a classic pixie like
light green no excess packaging to it I
love that you can see the shadows
unbelievable why isn't everyone talking
about this
so another product that I talk about a
lot and I think this used to be a really
like cult classic but I haven't heard
about it in years and it's one of those
things I'm wearing it today one of those
things that's like my secret weapon like
genuinely my secret weapon product this
is the Bobbi Brown corrector
I have the shade like this because they
have a lot of shades this is like a
concealer but it's I use it as an under
eye corrector meaning it's correcting
the blueness you know the dark under-eye
circles I have I'm really dark like
right there like I have some here but
I'm really dark right there and I
remember one time like my brother we
were like walking the streets of Chicago
or something and he was like did you get
like punched in the eye or something
I remember how what he asked and I was
like what and I was like wearing makeup
but he was like you're like you got like
blue there's like I said I'm like no I'm
like what so like you know the next time
where he little go guys ever look in the
mirror I'm like it's just like the
darkness I have there and I never really
thought about covering it very much
other than just regular concealer then
this came along this is the best product
I've ever found for covering that now
this is not crazy thick it's really not
like when I start thinking about like
those thick like Tarte erase paste kind
of thick that's like like my mom I
remember had a black eye a long time ago
just because of like an injury it's kind
of a funny injury but it was sad it was
funny she's fine now guys you can laugh
about it anyway I gave her that erase
paste and it freaking covered this is
not that caliber but this is the perfect
thing if you do have that darkness and
you're wanting to wear this every day
the erase paste is just so thick this is
just thick enough but it's got this like
quality to it that's like emollient and
so it doesn't look dry and cakey like
like I think of the NARS soft matte
complete concealer this is a very dry
concealer I can't use it there it's too
dry this is just the right amount of
amoliant that it looks like skin and it
like I'll put it on I put it on today
and I'm like but I'm amazed every single
time I use it every single time this is
one of those things that the second I
hit pan I'm buying it again because if I
if they ever discontinued this I would
buy probably way too many and they'd all
go bad but it's so above it's like on
its own level above like every other
product I have tried so many if you have
that problem save the money it's like 20
I want to see around 25 dollars worth
every penny
worth every penny I can't stress that
enough if you've tried this and you love
it let us know if you've tried it and
you don't like it let us know
I haven't heard anyone say anything
negative about this but I have an asked
a lot so I'm very curious about your
experience with this but I freaking love
it now I will say you need to find the
perfect shade for you because if you're
getting one too light it's not gonna
look like your skin if you get one too
dark well it's not gonna do its job so
you've really got a you know maybe go in
a store or I don't know you've got to
find the right shade but light bisque
was just perfect for me and I'll just do
this and that's it it's blended in it's
done
like it's oh my gosh and you don't need
to put a concealer on top of it nothing
it works amazing on its own now one
other thing doesn't settle into fine
lines of course it does like anything
but like especially if you're coming
right here as long as you're not going
too far out I think it can look gorgeous
can you set it with the powder of course
you can then it's even then you're
taking it and amping it up to the next
level okay I'll shut up about next
product a lot of people don't talk about
are these butter LONDON glazing eye
glosses man are these good this isn't
the shade icing and they're like this
gross light looks like a pudding it
really does kind of look gross but oh my
gosh and it feels like cold like a
pudding but it's this gorgeous liquid
eye shadow that dries of course but the
way I'll use these if you're intimidated
by it don't be all you need to do is you
know get a little bit maybe tap a little
bit off and just tap it all over your
lid all the way to the crease and then
just grab a brush and kind of blend into
the crease so that way there's no like
weird defining line where it starts and
ends unless you want like a cut crease
kind of a thing and that's all you need
to do it looks gorgeous sometimes I'll
do it and I'll put like a little bit of
a deeper shade in the crease to kind of
blend it together a little better but
you don't even need to do that so this
is the shade icing these do not budge
once they dry they're so pretty and the
other shade I really like is called
moonshine and this one is a little bit
more cool tone if you like that like a
very topi if you're a taupe lover you
will love this this one however has like
actual glitter in it but again because
the glitter is like suspended in it
there's like no fallout at all it's so
pretty so highly
do I think they'll go bad quicker than
some of the shadows maybe because I mean
it is just like this exposed bit you
could always get a tiny spatula and use
that if you're not comfortable putting
your fingers in it you know that's
totally up to you but stunning need i
say more
the next product that no one talks about
is from the brand studio makeup I'm not
100% sure where you can even buy these
so I will find the best link I can for
these and link it down below I got these
separately in two different like boxy
charms and so I know a lot of people
have them or at least I assume we do and
this was one that I thought I'm like ok
and I opened it this is the one called
warm up and I opened it I'm like not bad
this became one of my favorite palettes
of like all-time they're super fun but
actually a very similar formula to the
pixie shadow palette where it's not a
super thick formula but they're just
right they're pigmented enough to make
beautiful looks they blend so
beautifully and I loved the combo of
colors again very boring palette but if
you like boring palettes like me you'll
love it um but here's the thing these
are like weirdly expensive like I was
like it's in a boxy charm it'll probably
be a $15 palette no it was like $50 I'm
like what but it's still so good
the shimmers are really really really
pretty the mats are really really pretty
there are some of the shimmers this one
probably well it might show up on my
skin tone this one's really close to my
skin tone so it's harder to see but
gorgeous so the other one I really like
is the cool one called cool down and you
know it's obviously got some cooler
colors but I love oh my gosh these are
so freakin pretty so there's some of the
shimmers there let me get some of the
mattes like this really dark like
eggplant color
come on sleeve anyway so so gorgeous so
if somehow you can snag these from
someone or maybe you have in your
collection you really didn't give it a
try give it another try I'm so surprised
I travel with these a lot because
they're crazy thin again no excess
packaging but they have like every color
I could ever need
the looks that I typically do so those
are all of the products that I feel like
are
under hype they deserve more love
they're definitely worth checking out I
like I said if you enjoyed this video I
hope you'll give it a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
