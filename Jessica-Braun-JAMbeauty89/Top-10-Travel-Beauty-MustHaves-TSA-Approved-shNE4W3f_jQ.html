going to be sharing with you my top 10
makeup and beauty must haves for when
you're traveling so let's get into it so
the first thing I think of when I think
of traveling especially in an airplane
it is dry skin because for me I don't
really have the driest skin anymore but
I know that when I'm flying no matter
what I can just feel like the moisture
being sucked out of my skin and my hair
and my hands and my eyes I mean I just
lean feeling very dry whether it's a two
hour flight or a 10 hour flight so the
first thing I thought of when I thought
about dry skin was this thermal spring
water
I thought this when I was in France
actually this past summer
and you can buy it online here in the
state so I will link it below it is just
this aerosol mist that you can spray on
your face when you're feeling really dry
and it just adds moisture back into your
skin and I find that it feels really
refreshing but not only that but it
makes my skin let's look less crepey and
like if it were powdery just from just
having makeup sit on your face this is
awesome to just throw on top whether
you're in the airport like bathroom or
maybe you're even on the airplane in the
bathroom right before you're getting off
and you just want to spray it of course
they sell bigger bottles of this but I
just buy the small size because I don't
use it every single day in my regular
life but I always use it when I travel I
love this stuff so speaking of dry skin
the first place I noticed that I'd have
dryness when I'm flying is right here so
any like concealer I maybe have here
anything like that I can see it like
where my crow's feet are my miracle
product is from ELF and this is a really
really inexpensive product it's called
their daily moisture stick and it's
basically a stick that you can roll up
and it's a clear balm and the way you
use it is you could use a brush but I
always just use my finger and get some
of the clear balm on my finger and then
I just Pat it in this
and anything that was dry just is
instantly moisturized it's like it's
kind of like it blends together your
makeup with your skin and it adds a
little moisture so it ends up looking
flawless again the way you applied it
it's not even better than when you
applied it and I remember being really
doubtful of this product when I first
bought it because I thought well it's
gonna mess up my concealer or my makeup
or you know whatever's going on there
but it doesn't it really is as long as
you're not rubbing it back and forth as
long as you're just kind of pressing it
and tapping into the skin it is amazing
the next product I would recommend is an
awesome lip balm not just any lip balm
but one that is truly moisturizing my
favorite is from CEO Bigelow and they
sell it at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and online
it's called my favorite night balm and I
use it morning day night anytime it's
just so it's a thick foam but it's still
kind of creamy and I like that it's in a
squeezy tube so it's really easy to use
whereas like a potted balm you're
constantly putting your hands in and
like on airplanes you're touching so
many different things so I love this and
it's just so moisturizing and it stays
on for a couple of hours whereas some
bombs I've tried I'll just wear off
really quickly and it's inexpensive as
well so this is one that I swear by I've
used for years and I would recommend to
anyone the next thing I would recommend
is an awesome hand cream I've been
loving this skin fix one it's just
called their hand Repair Cream I think I
got this in a subscription box a couple
months ago but it's just a really creamy
one L'Occitane makes really nice ones I
mean there's so many brands that make
really nice hand creams so you really
can't go wrong if it's one that you've
tried before that you like because again
especially right now it's wintertime but
any time of year in fact I'm gonna put
some on right now it just feels so nice
to get some especially on the back of
your hands I feel like I always end up
rubbing most of it on the inside of my
hands so I try and apply it first to
like my knuckles on the outside that way
that gets most of the moisture since
that's really the part that gets the
driest for me so I love having a great
hand cream with you at all times in your
carry-on the next thing I would
recommend to kind of
your hair because for me my hair it
falls really flat really easily but not
only that it gets oily really quickly
and so even if my skin is dry and my
hair just gets kind of gross and matted
down on like eight or ten hour flight so
I've got two recommendations kind of in
one I would recommend a dry shampoo
above all else this is the batiste one
they have a million different cents this
one's in the scent blush and it just
smells really nice but you just spray it
in your roots let it sit and kind of dry
for a minute or two and then you just
kind of use your fingers to kind of
tousle it and rub it in and if you put a
lot it can have a white cast so if you
have dark hair like me you want to be
aware of that there are some that have a
brown tint to it I know Oscar blondie
makes a really nice brunette one but
teased to mix a brunette one too but it
ends up getting all over my hands so I
don't love that but anyway but it's just
a great way to add volume back to your
hair suck up any oil and like if it's
matted down just to help with that and
it really helps if you're wanting it
maybe you got on the plane with hair
like down and then by the time you're
getting off you're like I just want to
throw my hair into a cute messy bun this
is a great way to kind of add some
texture to your hair and give some
volume so it's really easy to throw into
just a messy cute updo when you get off
the plane and then another one kind of
lumped with that this is a really
expensive one but I've fallen in love
with it night I had to mention it it's
the Caribe dry texturising spray similar
to a dry shampoo and that it doesn't
it's not necessarily sticky and it kind
of just adds volume and texture to your
hair it doesn't soak up oil the same way
a dry shampoo does but it's amazing it
really helps make updos look awesome
speaking of hair and staying on that
note I would also recommend this
macadamia healing oil treatment this is
great if you tend to have really dry
ends to your hair you can get a tiny
tiny bit and even just work it through
your ends just throughout your day there
are lots of other dry oils that are
great for that too if you have maybe you
tend to have oily your hair but this is
also just great to bring with you for
your trip because it's a small little
bottle and then I just have my bigger
one that I refill this with so I don't
have to bring my big one and I don't
have to repurchase this all the time but
just how--
some sort of oil it works great for your
ends on your trip because if you're
going to a different climate you don't
really know how that's going to affect
your hair but it's nice to have
something that you know works with your
hair with you and maybe a smaller
container like this the next thing I
would recommend is investing in a good
quart sized clear bag I used to travel I
mean I travel all the time and I used to
use just a true quart sized ziploc bag
but then it get all ripped up by the
like halfway through the trip and then I
need a different one to be able to take
that stuff back home and it always just
stressed me out so I've used the old one
that's all a mess
finally I invested like I think four or
five dollars for this at I want to say
CVS somewhere like that I'll find some
that are available online that are
similar and lengthened below but I
bought this years ago it has lasted me I
can wipe it out I can clean it but it's
a really thick one
it's TSA approved which virtually any of
these are as long as it's clear but you
can even buy ones that say tsa approved
on it but as long as you can see through
it and it's the right size you're good
to go
and I just like that I had a little bit
of paint to it but it was just a
worthwhile couple dollar investment that
has saved me a lot of kind of stress
with that the next thing I would
recommend investing in is a really good
not just makeup bag but kind of toiletry
all in one bag this one's from a brand
called Kestrel if I can find it online
I'll link it I bought mine on HauteLook
calm which that stuff on there kind of
comes and goes so I don't know but I
will look for this online it's really
really well-made it's got a handle it
zips up but it's got enough compartments
that I can put toiletries in there I
mean whatever I need and I would say
this is better for a checked bag because
it is bigger and I don't always check
backs in fact for many trips I just use
carry-on you could put this kind of a
bag in here but you just have to
remember that when you go through
security you're gonna have to take it
out so you'd want it to be easily
accessible if you're carrying this on
but if you're checking it you could put
anything you want I mean you could fit
full-size things if you're just doing a
road trip you can put a full-size
hairsprays in this so it's really
well-made I love that I has different
compartments it was a very worthwhile
investment the next part I'm gonna
recommend is some skin care stuff um
invest in some makeup removing
towelettes I use
I don't use makeup remover wipes on my
face every day when I'm at home but I
will buy little packs of them because
they're so much easier to travel with
rather than bringing like cotton rounds
and a little bottle of the stuff that
might spill this is easy I don't have to
put it in my liquids container so it
doesn't take up that precious space so
these are both from the brand love fresh
there's a bunch of brands out there that
sell stuff I just have these on hand I
like this because it comes with eight
wipes so if it's just a week-long trip I
can just pack this tiny little thing I'm
good to go for like eight nights of
taking my makeup off these are great for
weekend trips these are like separately
wrapped ones so I can just grab two of
them and not worry about bringing an
entire thing of like 30 wipes or
anything like that I like the smaller
packs for that reason they're not really
practical for if you're using them
everyday I don't think but I mean for
trips they're perfect and they don't
take up a lot of room and you don't have
to worry about bringing them back home
with you because you'll have used them
up and they're not even in your luggage
anymore the last thing I'm gonna
recommend is bring a face wash that you
know works with your skin
I am so guilty of for a couple of years
I would just buy a cutesy little you
know travel sized face washes that were
cute but I never really tried them maybe
I tried them once before I went
but it wasn't my the one I had already
used with my skin and I had ended up
there not cleaning my skin well enough
or my skin reacted really badly there
was one trip I remember blue went to
Disney and my skin reacted terribly to
whatever I had been using that face wash
and I had to end up buying like another
law there it was such a to-do because in
Disney it's not as easy to get to like a
regular store anyway so this for example
is one that I ended up buying online
specifically because I knew it worked
well with my skin and I wanted the
travel size for that purpose so this is
the first a beauty face cleanser it
works well for me this doesn't mean
necessarily recommending this one I'm
just recommending that even if it's a
couple dollars more to buy whatever face
wash you're using or just buy one of
those cheap little refillable containers
take your face wash and squeeze it into
there or pump it into there that way you
have what you're used to using and not
you're just buying you know a double
face wash because it's there
you've never used it you know what I
mean I'm not knocking down face wash
I've never used it but you get what I'm
saying so those were my top ten travel
beauty must haves I hope that this was a
helpful video for you guys
I certainly have tried a lot of
different skincare and makeup and lots
of trial and error when it comes to
traveling both with carry-ons and with
check luggage if you'd like to see more
