share with you my favorite skincare
products of the moment I have a lot in
front of me so I'm not gonna do a huge
intro let's just go ahead and get into
it
so I do have some drug stores some more
high-end it really does range I've got
some things that are you know around $10
and I've got some things that around
like hundreds of dollars so I I try out
so much skincare so it's always exciting
for me to do these videos because I feel
like this is the time I can really tell
you like alright I've been trying you
know 50 products this year skincare and
these are my you know 10 to 12 favorites
or whatever it might be so this video is
sponsored by PMD and I'm going to show
you how I use the personal
microdermabrasion device here in just a
second but I like to be very upfront
early on in the video
this is sponsored I'm gonna show how I
use their product and then I'm gonna go
into a ton of other skincare products
I've been loving the PMD device looks
like this they have a few different
colors my husband actually has one too
and he's been using and he's been loving
it I used this product once a week after
I cleanse my face it's completely dry
and I'll show you a demo of me applying
it kind of as I explain how I use it and
then what it's been doing for my skin
this basically is kind of suctioning out
and exfoliating my skin as I use it so
what I do is I make sure that my face is
cleansed and completely dry and I start
from the inner parts of my face and just
work my way out and you want to make
sure that as you're using this you are
only making one pass on those areas of
your skin because doing it too much is
it going to exfoliate it more it's just
gonna start to irritate it after time so
making sure that you're only making one
pass in those areas sometimes I'll hold
my skin in place kind of holding my skin
taut so that I can get a really snug
nice pull against my skin and so I
continue to do that for all of my face
on both sides of my face and immediately
afterwards I'll put on a nice hydrating
maybe an essence something to kind of
calm the skin back down but here's the
thing I want to show you a before and
after of me who's in this because I've
been using it for six weeks and I've
been very thoughtful before you know
ever sitting down to do this video I
wanted to really have a good feel for
like does
this thing work cuz you know with any
product out there you we're all kind of
we're all kind of skeptical because
there's so many products out there and
it's like okay what really works what's
really worth the money so I wanted to
take some pictures along the way so
here's a picture of my skin when I first
got started you can see lots of redness
I mean you can just see it speaks for
itself and here's another picture about
halfway through using this so this is at
about the three week mark so you can see
some of the redness has gone down a
little bit and then this is at the six
week mark so this is my most recent
photo of my skin with nothing on it so
you can see when I show you where I
began and at six weeks so much of my
redness has gone down no makeup on or
anything like that it's just naturally
making my skin more even tone and for me
I wear a lot of makeup and over time I
think that ages my skin as well so just
cleansing my skin and putting
moisturizers and serums on I felt like
was doing a good job of helping with
anti aging but once I started
incorporating this and it's just once a
week I feel like my skin was suddenly
deeply cleansed but not only that but it
was just evening everything out it was
minimizing my pores just a little bit on
my nose and this is something that I'm
gonna continue to use every week because
I'm seeing that difference so if you
have a product like this or you do end
up buying this product I recommend take
up a for picture and and after you don't
take pictures on the way so you can see
because for me if I weren't to have
taken pictures I think I'd be like I
think it's working but when you can see
that black and white you know take the
picture in the same lighting at the same
time after you've done it every time
you're gonna be amazed because I know
that I was because I am skeptical it's
part of my job to be skeptical about
beauty products cuz I review them so
they did give me a 20% off code for use
on their website and anything on their
website so I will put that below its
Jessica 20 and like I said my husband's
using it too this is a good gift even
for husbands spouses friends male or
female it doesn't really matter because
we all have the same kinds of skin
problems pores that you want minimized
redness you want and another thing it
does I don't have a lot of acne scarring
and by a lot I mean I really don't
any from time to time I'll have a
breakout that's taking a while I had one
here and it really helped to get that
one down which was great but it helps
minimize acne scarring in those darker
spots on your face it helps to even
those out so if that's a problem you're
facing this would be a great tool for it
but one other thing I wanted to mention
just for education purposes is it does
come with different little discs that
you replace you use maybe two or three
times and then you replace this I worked
my way up I started with like the
training disc and then you kind of work
your way up through the different discs
and now I've got the green one so right
now I'm on the moderate so there's the
white is the ultra sensitive gray is
very sensitive blue is sensitive and I
literally worked my way up through those
and then green is moderate and I feel
like that's a good spot for me but red
is very coarse and then black is one you
use for your body so that's another
thing if you've got like you know
redness maybe on your arms or anything
like that
because they have a wider opening kind
of a cap for if you're wanting to do
larger areas like on your arms or on
your body so I thought that was really
great especially if you've got acne
scarring even on your body to help with
that and we're like those little bumps
on my arm I tried it in a few spots and
I was like whew I need to do this more
often on my arms too because I feel like
it would make a huge difference there
and I just look coffee all the way down
my shirt this is my life now okay so
let's start with some of the more
affordable products when it comes to
actual skin care products that you put
on your face one of my favorites I just
repurchased this this is the yes -
coconut ultra hydrating melting cleanser
this is a really beautiful smelling
product if you like coconuts if you
don't you probably won't like it but
it's 99% natural it's paraben free it's
got coconut oil Moringa seed oil this
stuff is this thick bomb basically that
you use on a dry face I'll usually rub
up to my fingers rub it all over my face
and it just breaks down all of the
makeup and dunk and gross stuff you put
on your face and it rinses away so well
I notice for me this works on my mascara
and liner now I don't wear waterproof
mascara so I just noticed
when I do my lashes start falling out
and so I just avoid it I don't know how
well this would work on that because I
don't wear it and if you are used to
wearing waterproof mascara one
recommendation I have is to really get a
really good makeup remover for that
because if you're tugging it there's
like that's what's gonna make them fall
out so I'm always hyper aware of that
but this stuff is amazing I haven't had
it in a while and I was excited to
repurchase it because I own this a
couple of these in the past and ever
since we moved into our house I kind of
forgot about and I've been trying new
ones but this is one of my favorites so
I highly recommend that for removing
makeup but I also have these these are
from Costco so you do have to have a
membership and we just recently got one
so I've been trying the Kirkland brand
daily facial challenge you buy a giant
box it's a ton it's an incredible deal I
don't use these on my face I use these
for swatches like all my hands and they
do a great job now do these work really
well with like again waterproof like
liner no I had some eyeliner on my hand
that I could not get off of this I had
to go get something else to remove it so
I think it's great for swatch removal or
just to like for me if I screw something
up on my face I can wipe it away really
quickly and you know fix that area so I
do love this and the deal I mean it's
such an amazing deal they don't break me
out or anything so I highly recommend
actually I have one right here that's
like almost gone here so that will be my
replacement so in other drugs too our
favorite is from sea reveille this is
their hydrating facial cleanser I can't
tell you how many of these I have owned
this is my favorite face wash period
doesn't matter drugstore high and it is
my favorite I've tried so many expensive
face washes that I've really liked but a
lot of them have fragrance in it and I'm
like you know what for a cleanser I
don't need a fragrance in it I just need
it to clean my face you know and
fragrance of course can be an irritant
for many many skin types and I'm gonna
be mentioning products and some of these
do have fragrance in them so it's not
like I 100 percent blanket statement
don't use things with fragrance but for
a cleanser I'm like I just need to get
my face clean I don't need it to smell
good but I love that it's got a pump
this is so flippin good especially if
you have dry skin even normal skin types
because it doesn't strip your skin but
it's definitely cleaned it you know what
I mean and it's it's the perfect balance
I recommend this to literally anyone
even in my personal life that asked me
what's the best drugstore skincare this
is the first thing I think of the first
thing I mentioned all right so some
cheap masks I love I'm just mentioning
one brand these are from patch ology
they've sent me some things I've got
these from octa Lee for free as well
a lot of this stuff was sent to me
honestly you guys I feel like across the
board I buy a lot of skincare my own but
I also get sent a lot and I kind of
organize them into drawers and then when
I'm ready to try one but you guys know
I'm always honest with you whether it
was sent to me or not that's just the
reality of my job anyway
so my original favorite from patch ology
are these hydrate masks these make loops
these make me smile they are so good
they're 5-minute masks so this is
amazing like if you're getting ready for
a special event but you don't have all
the time in the world that sit with a
sheet mask for 20 minutes then take it
off then start putting on makeup these
are amazing so when I've traveled for
events I'll bring these frankly just
when I travel I almost always bring
these Pathology 5-minute masks cuz
they're just quick now if I'm getting a
bubble bath and do a little thing I
don't use these up because I want to
save these for that five minute quick
purpose but they really hydrate your
skin so the hydrate ones are my favorite
another one I really like are they're
smart mud ones these are these detox
masks again I think they're five minutes
as well I might have left these on a lot
longer yeah I don't think these are like
flash ones yeah so the issue leave them
for longer but it's basically a clay
mask but you it's not messy it's the
most genius invention ever so it's got
the save detoxifying qualities as a clay
mask you'd be kind of painting your face
with but you put it on leave it on for
10 to 20 minutes and then you peel it
off and there's no mess but you kind of
your skin feels that same way it's a
genius genius invention and I am so
excited I discover these because I would
literally I just started avoiding my
masks I'm like my sink is a mess my
faces I mean everything is a mess trying
to get the mud masks off and this solves
that problem a product that's literally
gone I need a pack again this is the
belief the true cream moisturizing balm
they have an aqua version too that's not
quite as hydrating I like this version
specifically I flew through this quicker
ever flown through a moisturizer this I
use at night it's super moisturizing but
it still has kind of a gel like texture
so it's still lightweight in a way but
it feels deeply moisturizing you don't
feel like like there's some wishers have
used that people swear by like the drunk
elephant la la retro whipped cream one I
use that completely up and if you saw my
empties video it's kind of like mad
about it I feel like it was just I never
felt like my skin was moisturize with
this there is no doubt that my skin is
moisturize even when I oh I just love it
so much I love it so much I need to buy
it again I'm already like I have one
more use out of it I think and then
that's it which here's the thing this is
I think in the upper $30 range I want to
say maybe 38 it's worth every penny your
skin is so worth it when you can swing
it it's worth swinging and I love this
now another moisturizer I wanted to
mention this is another one I got from
octa Lee it's the Saturday skin
featherweight daily moisture cream this
I don't use at night I love before
makeup it's so good the packaging course
is adorable but you push this down and
you know fight to your skin really
hygienic packaging in that way it's so
nice and lightweight and yet
moisturizing I have it on under my
makeup today and I feel like it sinks in
quickly it doesn't mess with any primer
you might put on top of it or anything
like that if I'm using a facial oil I'll
usually put the facial oil on first then
this so I feel like the oil is kind of
penetrating then this then I can put a
primer on if I want foundation etc but
that's the way I've been using it I
really do like this for day-to-day daily
use now it doesn't have SPF so you'd
still need a layer of SPF as well
another product I'm wearing today is the
origins ginseng refreshing eye cream it
brightens and deep puffs you guys I have
two of these now I've got one in my
hospital bag to take with me and then
one like in my little drawer over here
to use every morning I don't use this at
night this is not the eye cream a use at
night but it is the best daytime eye
cream it I don't it doesn't necessarily
have a tingle it's kind of more of a
cooling feeling but it's got this color
too it's kind of a beige color and it
just kind of
right into that area it's not a
concealer it's not going to conceal you
know dark circles but I do feel like it
brightens it does kind of deep puffs
just a little bit it's a little bit
cooling and I feel like when under-eye
area is so moisturize which for me
hugely important because then I'm
putting concealer and powder on and with
dry skin it's just like a really bad
combo and you know like little crow's
feet things like that fine lines I
really really like this stuff if you
have not if you don't use an eye cream
in the morning when you get ready you
should it will make a difference with
your concealer and this is one you
should try seriously it's lasting me
forever it's in jar packaging which as
long as you're gonna use that by the end
it's fine you're using clean fingers
hopefully to apply it but I love it I
love this so much there's a reason I now
have two of them I was like this is
worth owning more than one of have it
all over my house this one took me by a
complete surprise this is from al Janice
and I really not tried a lot from al
Janice but this is their power
recharging night pressed serum so I use
this at night it's got this slightly
sweet smell that I am in love with it
every time I put it on at night which is
pretty much every night I'm like like it
smells like actually it kind of reminds
me of the sweet spun sugar candle I have
back there from Target like a lightly
sweet smell anyway which again fragrance
is not always great for skincare but
sometimes it's like anyway I know I'm
like contradicting myself completely I
don't know anyway this is a serum but
it's in a like its suspended in a cream
and I'm flying through this I mean
there's a ton in here but even still
it's the most enjoyable serum I've ever
used because you know I get a little bit
and I just kind of Pat it and it's a
really really thin formula once you get
it kind of once it comes in contact with
the heat of your skin it really quickly
fins out all over your face and I feel
like my skin is like like literally
every time I use it I'll stop and I'll
just look in the mirror and let it sink
in I'm like you're welcome skin like it
is so and I'm now really felt that way
about a serum really ever and it is
different it's not in the you know kind
of more of an oil type format but I
absolutely obsessed with it again I've
already got a backup
I'm incredulous at how much I loved it
another one that took me by surprise
that I've been waiting a while to try
because they sent me this a long time
ago
it's from tatcha it's their polish
gentle rice enzyme powder I was like
what is this so it says this one's for
dry skin they have a few different
levels so this is the gentle one then
they have a normal rice enzyme and then
they have like a one more level but
anyway it says you pour about half a
teaspoon into wet hands so what I do is
I actually pour it into dry hands and
then I literally get a little dab of
water it says add water create a creamy
foam do you massage it onto your wet
face for 10 to 20 seconds oh my gosh so
I have been using this instead of a
cleanser because this is literally
unopened I bought this but I'd open this
and I'm like I'm gonna keep using this
so I've used it almost to the end and
then I'll go back to this probably but
then I might but maybe every by this
it's such a weird product and I don't
even know that it's necessarily meant to
be a straight-up cleanser but I'm like
but that's why I've been using it and
it's been working really well I've had
like no breakouts so literally it's a
little you know thing with a lid and you
just slide that back and it reveals a
little hole I always remove my makeup
before I do this step obviously because
I don't think this would be a great
makeup remover at all but just to get
those last little bits off my skin it's
really gentle I feel like my skin loves
it and again since my redness has gone
down so much this is just a lovely
product to use last few items this is
from pharmacy I know something I talk
about this all the time but I I almost
thought I'm not gonna mention I don't
but I'm like no but it really is one of
my favorite skincare products this is
their skin do it's an essence mist they
say you can use this study setting spray
I really pretty much only use it it's
the first step in the morning that I
take on my skin so I will take this bare
face and spray it everywhere let it sink
in it just again does a great job of if
I do have any discoloration on my face
this is amazing it just wakes your skin
up especially if you're getting up early
like I'm a teacher used to getting up
really early this is a great way to wake
up it again kind of evens out that skin
tone if you need it it's got lots of
antioxidants in it which is great for
fighting against free radicals and just
all the environmental stressors out
that affect your skin but I also like
it's got there free of artificial
coloring or anything so this is the
natural color of these ingredients so it
even says you know the color might
change over time and you know there's
nothing wrong with that I'm like that's
awesome
all right so next product is from Sunday
Riley I wanted to mention more than one
Sunday Riley product but I'm like you
know what there are a few products I'm
really really enjoying but I want to use
for longer to continue to make sure you
know what I mean because they are
expensive but this I've gone through a
whole one and they sent this to me a
while ago and I was like literally
throwing up excited it's they're good
jeans lactic acid treatment you guys
this is a chemical level exfoliant so
it's not something with beads that
you're kind of rubbing into your face
because those can kind of cause little
micro tears things like that and that's
more of just a physical exfoliation this
does that the chemical level and so for
me I'll use this a couple times a week
usually every other day kind of
depending you can use it everyday but
you want to kind of make sure your skin
reacts well to it over time before you
start using everyday frankly it's just
so expensive I want to use it everyday
but I'm trying to just space it out so
it does have a slight tingle on your
skin when you put it on and it really is
like a cream texture and you just put it
on almost as if it's a moisturizer but
I'll leave it on for a few minutes let
it sink in and I then I'll put on so
I'll still put on a moisturizer on top
and things like that because I still but
it's just sorry my little girl and my
tummy is kicked at me I am at the time
of filming this I'm like almost 37 weeks
pregnant I'm pre filming a lot so I
don't know when you'll see this she is
just moving around in there it's
starting to get RORO uncomfortable for
her and for me anyway
I feel like my skin looks so revives the
next morning but when I do use this
honestly my skin looks so revived in the
morning and more evened out I'm not
having breakup I mean it is just it's
one of those things that it's like one
of those secret weapon products that
people with really great skin are
probably using something like this a
chemical exfoliant and once you figure
out what it is younger that's why their
skin is so nice so their description is
that exfoliates dull pore clogging
skin cells to instantly clarify and
reveal smoother clearer skin and I will
completely agree with that so those are
all of the products I wanted to mention
today again if you're interested in the
PMD device that I'm obsessed with I will
link the product down below as well as
the 20% off code which is Jessica xx
