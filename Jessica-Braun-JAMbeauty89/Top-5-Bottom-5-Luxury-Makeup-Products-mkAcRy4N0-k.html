new kind of video for you I guess it's
not like that new but I don't think I've
ever done one of these on my channel and
so today I'm going to feature my top 5
luxury or high-end products and my
bottom 5 I used to do this series on my
channel called Fast Five and it was
where I would feature like you know my
top 5 of whatever but I never mentioned
my bottom 5 so I've seen a couple
youtubers here on YouTube that was
department of redundancy department I've
seen a couple of youtubers do these
kinds of videos top 5 bottom 5 and I
love the idea I enjoy watching them I
figured you guys would as well so let's
go and get into it oh my gosh I'm going
to make so many people mad in this video
unintentionally because some of my
bottom 5 are ones that I know a lot of
people love and I don't think are worth
the money but let's start on a positive
note let's do my top 5 first I'm so
excited I've been excited to do this
video for a couple days now so I'm
excited that it's the weekend I'm done
teaching for the week and so I can like
breathe and film so well it's the
weekend when I'm filming this I'm not
sure when this is going up okay Jessica
stop talking alright so the first one
that I think is absolutely worth the
money
is this RMS beauty highlighter and it's
called their living Luminizer now this
product is a highlighter but it's a very
different style so it's actually really
small it's like the size of a cream
eyeshadow and this one is a white kind
of base color but it doesn't come on as
white so it's a really creamy product
but it is more like a gloss and I don't
own anything like this in my collection
it's just a really glossy finish I put
it on today let me put on a little more
so you can get an idea of kind of what
it looks like so you just kind of Pat it
on and it just has this really glossy
luminous finish to it and I think it's
so I can't say natural but more natural
than anything else I've used while still
looking nice and it looks like you're
glowing and it's just like that kind of
the effect you see like I think of like
a lot of the models that are marketing a
lot of kind of glossy highlighting
products this is
exactly the kind of products I feel like
very using and this I have the living
Luminizer shade which is this one so the
other shade I have is master mixer I
like this one as well as more golden but
I like to the white one a little bit
better probably because I'm fair fairer
more fair but this one is really pretty
as well again it has more of a golden
tone these are hard to swatch and see
because they're not that kind of a
product but they're so beautiful
I love that the packaging is like
frosted with the lid I don't know why
but I do they have another one out
that's like a more rose gold one
although master mixture is kind of that
rosy gold as well anyway I haven't tried
that one but I love both of them they're
absolutely gorgeous the perfect light
like when you see people only a handful
of you guys are going to understand this
and if you do know what I'm saying
comment below but I feel scary watched
some people and they're getting ready
and it's like and it's like absolute
flawless I'm like what but I'm like so
jealous I'm like man I think that was so
simple there's a full moon and it was so
beautiful this is that kind of a product
where I feel like I'm like and it's just
like freakin flawless that's this kind
of a product does that make sense I bet
it makes sense of some of you next
product is this hourglass eyeliner this
stuff has completely changed my life
seriously and it's the hourglass 1.5
millimeter mechanical gel eyeliner in
the shade obsidium which is like they're
black so its retractable it is the
thinnest tiniest eyeliner I've ever seen
now they sell these in single packs
which is what I bought because I've
never tried it before from Sephora but
they also sell it in triple pack so you
can buy a three pack which honestly I'm
probably going to buy that next time so
it's a super skinny thin eyeliner you
don't have to sharpen it's mechanical
but it is the blackest thing you've ever
seen
creamiest thing you've ever used and I
put it today I can tightline like it's
done I can do my waterline and it stays
all day it's so precise so creamy so
long wearing I've never tried new
product like this before my
life it's amazing if you feel like
you've never really found a mechanical
eyeliner that you've loved that stays
put maybe you want a waterline one maybe
you just want one to tightline you want
it to be super precise this is amazing
now I've never done like winged liner
with it only because I always use a
liquid liner that's got like a really
pointed tip to kind of create that shape
and fill it in but I feel like you
probably could it might be a little too
thick it just kind of depends but it's
so amazing I totally recommend it hands
down totally blue every other eyeliner
now there's a lot of other eyeliners I
love but this one because it's so
precise as well is why it's kind of just
jumped up in the ranks for me the next
product I have to mention I'm wearing on
my eyes today I try to wear I think I'm
wearing everything that's in my top 5 on
my face today it is the milk eye
pigments now these they sent to me a
while ago but you guys know a lot of the
products I own or sent to me and I will
tell you whether I love them or hate
them in fact some of the products that
I'm going to mention that I hated were
sent to me so I'm always honest with you
guys that doesn't sway me one way or the
other but these are amazing and I keep
showing them on snapchat as I I always
show these on snapchat when I'm getting
ready in the mornings because I usually
snap and show like what makeup I'm using
that morning etc well these keep showing
up because I'm using them everyday so
the shade I'm wearing today is called
after party and it's this beautiful you
know these are just little creamy
pigments you need the tiniest bit in
fact this is a ton but this is like a
really pretty pinky shimmer and I just
love it these freakin stay put in fact I
need to wipe this swatch off right now
because it will stay there until I get
like an oil-based cleanser to clean it
off but they're so amazing they don't
budge if you want it even if you don't
want to put it like on your lids or
whatever if you want to do like an inner
corner highlight and you did not want it
to move which why would you want that to
move and I feel like inner corner
highlights are notorious for like
disappearing after an hour too but these
like if you get dip you're a thin thin
tiny brush in it and put it in your
inner corner
is not moving you could be crying and it
doesn't move so the sheets I like of
course are the more neutral one so I
have the after-party one I just showed
you this one is gig which is more of
like a bronzy gold then like a nice
light gold is hotel lobby then they have
oh I like this one too this one's in the
shade all-nighter but then they have
these fun like silver colors they also
have a purple a green a blue and let me
just show you these are so ridiculous
okay
it's like comical how unbelievable it is
I mean these are so amazing so what talk
about like packing a punch these pack
the punch you want so if you do want
some color if you like that kind of a
thing this is amazing you could dip a
liner brush in it and use it as liner if
you wanted because again it doesn't move
so now my next favorite high-end product
that I bought are these NARS Velvet lip
glides I own two shades I think these
are the two most natural in the bunch I
think so but this one is in the shade
bound and it's this beautiful kind of
blue toned and put it on top of the
green but it's a beautiful blue toned
pink but then I bought very recently
this shade and pit
I almost said Pigpen like from freaking
Charlie Brown that's awesome play a pen
and it's a more peachy shade and I'm
wearing today but I'm going to been
drinking coffee so I'm looking in a
mirror over here I'm sure you could have
figured that out just looking in the
distance and wistfully applying its so
these are really pigmented but they're
not like totally see-through opaque
they're pretty much opaque don't talk
and apply just but they're really more
just like this beautiful I can't even
say a wash of color
let me swatch this next to bounds you
can kind of see both to see the
difference so this one is bound that
one's placement I almost said Pigpen
again
but these are so comfortable and they
look so healthy on the lips so for me
for my
everyday I'm not wearing all the time a
bright red lip a bright berry lips I
love red and berry lips some of my
favorite looks I've ever done on myself
but for every day most of us are just
wanting something that make sure let's
look nice but it's not hard to keep up
it's not something that you're worrying
about looking crazy and smudged all over
your face throughout the day and these
are the answer they're really pricey but
they're comfortable they're beautiful
colors they look so healthy on the skin
and that's why I love them they're kind
of like this whipped mixed with gloss
formula and they're comfortable and they
don't feel sticky and so for me that is
a total win okay so number so my number
5 is this Weiser busy art palette and
it's in the neutral matte shade now they
it's not necessarily this one that I
think is totally worth the splurge it's
any of them these shadows are on a
completely different level than any
shadows of ever used by war I'm wearing
only this on my eyes today mixed with
the milk pigment in after party if I can
find it so this is all over my lids and
then I use this for everything else so
the thing that's amazing about these are
I mean the packaging is no-nonsense
they're not trying to sell you on the
packaging it's completely like you can
tell these are geared towards makeup
artist even the little symbol is like a
makeup artist kind of directors type
chair but what's amazing about this is
the blend ability and the pigmentation
any eyeshadow even drugstore can be
crazy pigmented but the difference might
be that they're not as easy to blend and
these have both I felt like and it I
love this and I also love my Kat Von D
shade + light eyeshadow palette that one
is absolutely on par with this one but I
do think this one is just like one step
above but they're both so close and even
similar shades that either way you go
you're going to be so blown out of the
water but this is the one I picked for
this video because I feel like and I
work today I'm wearing some of these
neutrals
I'm wearing actually just kind of like
warm brown color all over my crease and
then I on my outer corner of the darker
brown and I also
that on the lower lashline I use some of
these I use the white one under my brow
bone I use these to kind of blend
everything together I think I use a
little bit of this brown in the crease
as well but the thing about this is
everything like you start to put
something on you're like oh I
accidentally got that a little farther
out so you grab a clean brush and you
start blending and it blends like
freakin a dream I've never ever tried
shadows like this in my life they and I
think I've always thought like oh wow
this shadow blends really well but then
I tried this and I was like holy moly
this is this is what people mean by it
blends really well this so now I compare
everything else they own to this and I'm
like oh my gosh like this is just like
if you hadn't clearly at a loss for
words if you've never tried this and you
have like a gift card or somehow you
have it in your budget or you can save
up and buy they have a couple of these
palettes and I'll put them on the screen
right now the different options they
have find one that really speaks to you
shadow wise and if it's in your budget
try it out now I will say the Sonia
Kashuk dupe for this I can do what it's
called but I'll put that on the screen
as well it's really close to this one
again the blend ability is different but
it's still a really good palette so if
you're really attracted to these colors
try that out see if you like it because
I mean it'd be better to spend less and
at least try the colors out first and
see if you like it and then maybe
splurge because it's not worth buying
something like this if you don't even
like the colors who cares if it blends
well if you are never going to use the
colors in it right okay I have a sixth
item that I like well that ruins the top
5 and top 5 is way catch here but
there's one more that I feel like
mentioning because it is so so beautiful
and it is it is really new too it's the
Marc Jacobs do you do drops and it's
their coconut gel highlighter now this
reminds me a lot of the Becca shimmering
skin perfecter liquid and I have that in
opal let me show you a comparison of
this versus that so the Marc Jacobs is
you know it's expensive it's really
expensive but if you're watching this
video you know all of these products
expenses and just strapped in because
I'm about to tear five products apart as
well but this is the beautiful packaging
it's the same as their coconut gel
primer which I have they've got a lot of
products packaged like this package just
like this where it's this nice frosted
heavy glass not ideal to travel with and
I travel like once a month but I love it
and it's got the nice you know white
little lid great pump the pump is one
that you can totally control how much
comes out so the shade of this by the
way is do you I don't know if I don't
remember if they had other shades so
it's this beautiful light gold shade
which i think is beautiful on every skin
tone I've got a lighter skin tone and it
still looks nice I actually put this on
my decollete today I'll put a little bit
more just because I had put the RMS on
today and I didn't want to like mix that
but oh no can you were here but it's so
beautiful everywhere you can mix this
with a body lotion you can mix this with
a foundation you can put it on on its
own though which is typically how I wear
just in my kind of highlight regions on
the tip of my nose etc so that's what
that looks like now I have the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in opal now
the shade white honestly formula wise I
think the Marc Jacobs one is maybe a
little bit thinner but it's so slight
but opal is a deeper color it's a more
kind of bronze E but again even if you
have a light skin tone don't be scared
of this because it still looks gorgeous
it's not it looks kind of deep compared
to that but it's still beautiful so if
you're like dying to try it that's not a
reason to not buy it because it really
is beautiful but I think I like the Marc
Jacobs one better now that does sell
different shapes and they probably sell
a shade similar to this and I'm sure you
guys that have tried it can tell us
below and we'll all kind of thumbs it up
so it can kind of climb to the top of
the comments but I'm sure some of you
guys can tell me what is kind of the
equivalent shade of this in this but I
guess the reason I'm mentioning both is
that they're both amazing but I was
really blown away with how the coconut
gel highlighter I feel like it stays on
all day it has this beautiful
not smell and just this gorgeous
packaging and just all of that combined
and I think with my skin tone this shade
looks better you know it's a little bit
closer to my skin tone not that if you
have a different skin tone then you
can't wear it because of course you can
it's a highlighter but I was just so
blown away and I haven't heard like
anyone talk about it so I had to mention
it thank you for letting me say my six
items now on to stuff I didn't love
first thing so many of you guys are
going to be mad mad mad mad
it's the anasazi --i cream foundation
what do they call it's their thick
foundation here's the thing I am
obsessed with the packaging which is why
this is been on my little and I know I'm
not alone but I have like on my phone in
my reminders app or maybe it's a my
Notes app I probably have it on both
let's be real but anyway I have a list
of products on my phone that I want to
try to all watch youtube videos because
I watch youtube videos more than I watch
TV and I know a lot of you guys do too
so I watched tons of YouTube videos and
every time I see something that I'm like
no I want it well this has been on that
list forever
so I finally bit the bullet and bought
it it sucks if you have dry skin now you
have oily skin this might be amazing
because again the packaging is literally
I don't know why I mean it's so simple
there's nothing that special about it
but for some reason I am so drawn to
this packaging like I feel like no
matter how much I declutter I don't want
to get rid of it because it's so pretty
and I want to be able to compare it to
my hourglass vanish Foundation which I'm
wearing today which is like mine again I
wanted to mention there's so many
products because I mentioned that I love
that are high-end I had to cut it off
but I do love my hourglass vanish
foundation stick it is the best
foundation stick I've ever found if you
have dry skin it glides on you could use
it with a Beauty Blender you could use
it with a brush I love actually the
hourglass brush I will link both of them
below I have like five shades
I love the hourglass foundation stick
anyway this one is horrible for dry skin
because it just cleans
everything now it's not to say that the
hourglass one doesn't cling a little bit
because it does but the hourglass one is
so unbelievably flawless and way
creamier that I forgive it for that
because anytime I've gone to any makeup
event what was I wearing hourglass
vanish foundation stick anytime I knew
my photo is being taken with flash
photography hourglass foundation stick
any time I travel hourglass vanish
foundation stick like I always wear that
one so it's this have like big shoes to
fill
and it just didn't fill them now I do
think this shade is a good shade match
for me so if you're similar to me and
you're dying to try it or maybe you have
oily skin and so you know like this is
very mattifying in a way and again like
if you have dry skin it cleans right to
that but I have it in warm porcelain and
it is perfect for me so beautiful
packaging I'm really sad because I love
my Anasazi a dip brow that's what I'm
wearing on my brows today I love the
freaking triangular brow pencil they
have I love the regular brow Wiz I have
all that medium brown I love the Anasazi
uh Renaissance cow Modern Renaissance
palette and I cannot get my hands on the
freaking Mario palette it's like sold
out every time I try to buy it anyway
but I love Anasazi I hated their
foundation sticks that's my two cents
another product that has been touted a
lot on YouTube and it's not that I hate
it it's that there's no way it's worth
the freakin price tag and it is the Yves
Saint Laurent or YSL Touche clot radiant
touch little wand now I always group
this with my concealers but it's kind of
in between a concealer and a highlighter
and when I say a highlighter I don't
mean something that's glittery and like
a boom glow I mean something that's
brightening and that's where I kind of
put it right in between but I always
house it with my concealers and if you
seem like my concealer declutter video
this was with them I kept it because I
don't hate it
but who how does that just drip out so
you click the back and it's a little
brush and it's this kind of concealer
shade I have it in the shade number two
it's a concealer shade
but when you blend it out it's not
necessarily meant to cancel out dark
circles things like that it's more meant
to just brighten but even for that I
don't think it does a great job like I
feel like okay I mean I have a drugstore
version of this that's way cheaper that
does a better job so this is the number
seven radiant glow concealer this stuff
does a way better job of concealing and
brightening this stuff is way way
cheaper it's not like half the price
maybe a little bit more I bought mine at
Target and I've had this for as long as
I've had this probably a year maybe two
years and I keep talking about this one
because it's better than the white sl1
I'm telling you this number seven one
from Target is so gorgeous and when you
put it on your under eye especially if
you don't have like big things to
conceal I'll just use my finger to tap
it in and it blends instantly and it is
so gorgeous and so I'll never ever ever
buy another one of these I'll use it up
because I spent the money and you know
it's not bad it's just that there are
cheaper alternatives that are better and
when I can find a drugstore dupe that's
better then this is not worth the price
tag of course it's in my bottom five not
that it's bad but because there's one
better for white paper this next one is
so expensive now this one I didn't buy
this was sent to me through hasta li
which is amazing because they'll send
you free products from all these really
nice brands as long as you talk about
them and they don't care if it's
negative or positive you're just
supposed to review them I'm like perfect
and so a lot of youtubers a lot of
Instagram is a lot of people with bigger
social media presences use oculi because
it's like the easiest thing in the world
but I love that you know if you've got a
negative review okay then sharing but
they want people just trying all of the
products and I think that is so awesome
because you know there's a lot of shady
companies out there that are like you
can only talk good about our products or
we won't send you anything and I'm like
then no thanks
either send it but know that there's
might be a negative review or don't send
it at all because I'm not going to
guarantee a POSIX 101 anyway
I'll link it below if you're curious
about it anyway so I was sent this
through them and I had just been trying
it out I posted on Instagram about it
when I first got it on something I'm
trying this out so far I like it well
this is their Rouge inter D lipstick and
it's in the shade 13 Rouge introduced so
it's like their classic red I just felt
like it was nothing special it's not
that it was like you know it's like the
words dry and most drying lipstick ever
know it was that how is this as
expensive as it is for just a normal lip
lipstick like I feel like the r-mo
lipsticks are exactly the same where
they've got pretty good pigmentation but
they don't stay all day so you have to
reapply and that's about it
like it nothing like the Marc Jacobs
lipsticks I love because I freaking put
those bad boys on and they're so creamy
and my crazy pigmented and they they're
beautiful they're comfortable they last
so long well they're about the same
price tag as this and this is just like
a normal drugstore like Revlon Super
Lustrous lipstick which I love but for
the price tag I'll buy the Revlon one
why would I spend way more like six
seven times more for something that is
the same thing as the seven dollar
lipstick you know what I'm saying so for
that reason alone this is a huge pass
the packaging is okay it's got like that
kind of in my opinion cool but kind of
weird packaging I mean it is what it is
but not worth it this next one I did a
whole is it worth it video about it if
you've never seen my is it worth it
series it's a whole dedicated video
about different really expensive
products and I demo it I try it on in
front of the camera close up and show
you like is it actually worth the price
tag or not and I love doing those videos
so I'll link to playlist below I did one
about this this is the top out luminous
dewy skin miss Jaclyn hill talks about
this all the time I love Jacqueline this
is the top chat luminous dewy skin mist
and she loved it now I do know that a
lot of times when she'll apply it she'll
like cover an eye and do it just because
it is oil-based it'll mess with your
mascara and liner and stuff like that
this is just too much the only way I
found possible to wear this is like if I
put it on maybe right after foundation
with nothing on my eyes or maybe before
foundation
like a primer but again I've got a
million primers I like way more now I've
got dry skin so if anyone would want a
dewy skin mist it would be me and it's
two months it's a beautiful packaging
beautiful spray that's about the only
way I can do that where I just kind of
like I just breathe that in hardcore now
adoption is known for having pretty good
ingredients I mean great stuff that this
brand is doing but I just didn't feel
like this has a use in my makeup
collection I feel like I can't get rid
of it yet because I want to just keep
trying out like why did she love it so
much why do people love it so much but I
don't know like this is one that I'm
like now try the beautiful Milani
setting spray that I love that is way
cheaper that stuff is amazing I will
link that below as well underneath this
because I use that every single day I'm
already like halfway through it and I've
never gone through settings for that
fast my last product that I'm going to
mention that I thought was absolutely
not worth the money
this is nearly $70 and it's from Mac I
just bought it a couple weeks ago it's
the Mac in the flush palette now I
didn't get ready with me with this and a
bunch actually some of these products
were in it a huge like Sephora haul get
ready with me first impressions kind of
a video and this was so unimpressive now
I like Mac shadows I do but like they
were this is so expensive when I should
have gone in and bought all these
shadows separately and bought this like
holder without saying in the flesh for
even cheaper and I thought wow when I
looked online I'm like these shadows are
totally right up my alley I will love
these well there are way more lighter
shades than it appears online and some
of the shimmers like this one here is
like this weird patchy like almost
pigmented but it gives you fallout it's
just kind of patchy and then the rest of
the shades are just so similar I thought
what like I love the matte black I love
a lot of these but like this silver
color I'll probably never wear these two
are almost the same exact color
same with these two here like I don't
know I just felt like for the price tag
of $70 you could spend $20 less and get
a naked palette or the chocolate bar
palette for the freaking lorac Pro one
two or three and find shades that you
really love totally not worth the money
the looks I got was it we're okay I mean
it you know the blendabilities all right
I mean it's max shadows have you ever
tried one they all differ so much that's
what's frustrating I feel like so many
max shadows differ wildly and so you
never really know what you're going to
get and I feel like back in the day that
wasn't the case but I don't know lately
I've been very disillusioned with a lot
of Mac products and this was just
another one to add to that list and I
met on on Mac's PR list it's not like
you know I do like a lot of Mac products
I love their fix plus I love their cream
paint pops I love their strobe cream so
there are products I love and there are
a lot of Mac shadows that are absolutely
holy grails but I felt like out of this
what I'll probably do if I don't end up
returning it is popping out some of
these shades and replacing the ones I
don't like with other shades so I don't
think it's worth the money so those were
my top five bottom five or really top
six bottom five products that are
high-end or luxury that I loved or hated
I hope that was helpful I hope it was
fun again it's just makeup don't take it
personally but I hope you enjoyed it and
while you're here I hope that you will
subscribe and tap the little bell to get
notified whenever I upload new videos
