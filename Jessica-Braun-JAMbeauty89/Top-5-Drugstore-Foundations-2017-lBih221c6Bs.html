going to share with you my top 5
foundations from the drugstore you guys
know that I love the drugstore I do a
lot of high-end stuff but I love
drugstore these are things that I wear
all the time it's not just that I'm
talking about them because they're
drugstore and separating them into their
own category these are things that I
genuinely love and wear and travel with
all the time so I hope that you will
subscribe before you leave if you enjoy
this kind of video check out some of my
other drugstore reviews and let's go and
get into it ok so I'm going to rank
these from number 5 to number 1 now in
all honesty these are things that all of
them are great and they're all great for
different reasons so some of them are
more high coverage some of them are
better for if you really don't have a
lot to cover and things like that so
even though I'm ranking them just know
that there might be one here that I
ranked at number 5 that might be totally
your number one and that's awesome
because we all have different skin types
so my number 5 is the L'Oreal infallible
total cover now this is the foundation
that they say it's full coverage that
it's weightless I think that it is not
weightless but it really does have that
full coverage that just makes a huge
difference when it comes to if you get
acne scarring or just hyperpigmentation
freckles whatever it is that you're
wanting to cover that's one of those
things that it totally covers it but it
doesn't look completely flawless does
that make sense so if you're wanting to
coverage more than you're wanting to
look natural you will really like that
foundation now for me I still like it
and I do wear it when I've done events
or if there's flash photography things
like that but beyond that that is not an
everyday foundation for me I would never
wear it to work just because you know
the fluorescent lighting at work it
would just look really bad so that is
not one that I go for my number four is
the Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating
tint now this is something that would be
great if you do not have a lot to cover
the packaging on this is actually really
cool because you open it and it's a huge
doe foot applicator which I just think
is fun feel like you're painting your
face but it has a very light weight feel
unlike the other one this is something
that you can just put all over your face
really quickly blend it in with your
fingers with the brush of blender or
sponge if you want and it just looks
natural and your skin can
breathe you don't have a weird like mask
on and so this is one that I reach for
all the time when I'm working or even
just in the summer when I just don't
want like a ton of stuff on my face I
just want it to look a little more
natural a little bit more perfected the
number-3 Foundation is a new one to my
collection into my mind it's the
covergirl vitalist healthy elixir
foundation and if they say it's got like
vitamins and all this stuff I don't know
about the skincare claims I'm not a
dermatologist but I do know that when I
wear this it's kind of like I'm bridging
the gap between a full coverage
foundation and one that's more
lightweight it's right in between and I
think that is so amazing because most
days I do want a little bit more
coverage but again I don't want that
cake face and this says that for me my
favorite way to apply it is just with a
sponge just cuz I feel like it does a
great job of making it look more natural
whereas when I put it on with a brush I
feel like it just kind of rubs it back
and forth and it never really sinks into
my skin the way I want it to with this
kind of a foundation also the packaging
is really really pretty and it has SPF
of 20 always a bonus especially for
every day so my number two did I say
that last one was number three
this one is number two that one was
number three I forgot that I was
counting down I started count up in my
head this one is number two it is the
Rimmel lasting finish foundation this
was one that I remember like five years
ago or whenever I started my channel
I loved this stuff but I hated that it
was that kind of managing where's the
glass like pour out kind of a lip and
you just got to pour it out you make a
mess you waste more than what you use
I'm just liking it so old school but
it's not a good foundation and I wish
they'd put a pump on it I know that you
can buy some pumps like online to put on
it in fact I might have even had a pump
for it long ago and I'm such entity for
getting rid of it because this is
amazing it's another one I think yeah it
has SPF of 20 as well but this one has
really good coverage without being as
thick as like that L'Oreal one and
that's why this one is so high on my
list because again I could wear this
every day I just choose not to because I
don't need this much coverage but if you
did this is an awesome everyday option
because it gives you the coverage but
it's a little bit more comfortable it's
not as thick not as cakey if you are
sensitive to smell however
it definitely has a very obvious smell
so it's kind of one of those things that
if the smell bothers you like - loriell
freakin lipsticks that smell I can't I
can't do it I cannot wear those
lipsticks because it's such a strong
smell and I don't like this smell this
is a smell of strong but I don't mind it
so it kind of just depends on your taste
but it is amazing and it's really really
inexpensive number one number one
the elf flawless finish foundation this
thing when I first tried it like year
and a half ago I was so blown away
because I had never I tried tons of elf
products I've done tons of videos on
them best and worse and all that but
this is one of those things that I'd
never tried any their foundations
because I was like elf foundation like I
don't want to put that cheap stuff all
over my face I'm going to break down
like it's not gonna have good
ingredients I had all those snobby
thoughts this stuff is amazing it oh my
gosh I don't even know where to begin
this is my number one Holy Grail like
high-end drugstore doesn't matter this
is my favorite because it's got a pump
which is just a huge bonus but I think
it's six dollars at least the last I
remember - the six dollars and it covers
so beautifully it looks like your skin
but it is so perfecting it's one of
those things that it makes you look like
you've got that Instagram filter on your
face naturally but we all know it's not
natural we all wish it was natural this
stuff looks incredible they don't have a
huge shade range I know they added maybe
four or five more shades very very
recently but again with any drugstore
range they just don't typically have as
much of a range that's not true about
all of them but it's true about many of
them but it's getting better else has
heard a lot of our cries about extending
their shade range so this stuff is
amazing for everyday it's amazing for
photography it has SPF of 15 that I've
never noticed any sort of flashback with
flash photography with this because I've
also worn this to events - and it's just
gorgeous my favorite way to apply it is
with a sponge but you can totally apply
it with your fingers you can apply it
with a brush you can do anything you
want with this I've even gotten it to
the point where I have like three shades
and so depending on where I'm at I'll
mix them if I need to you can mix it
with moisturizer you can mix it with
anything it's just a foolproof
foundation if you haven't tried it and
you've been watching my channel for a
while I've been talking
of this for like a year and a half in
like all kinds of videos you need to go
out and try it if you can find your
shade it is totally worth the six
dollars you will love it okay so those
are my top five drugstore foundations if
you enjoyed this kind of video
definitely give it a thumbs up I hope
you come say hi to me on my social media

platforms other than that I'll see you
