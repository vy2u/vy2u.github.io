going to share with you guys my top 5
favorite skin care products for dry skin
if you have oily skin you I mean you
might like some of these products it's
not that you won't especially there's
about three that you'll probably love so
but I do want to make it known that I
have very dry skin especially in this
region on my nose up here even sometimes
on my chin sometimes around my eyes so
if that's you you're going to love reuse
products if you kind of have combo I
still think you're going to love them
and if you have oily skin I think there
are about three products that you will
still like so I'll mention those aspeed
beginning so that you can kind of get
those and then you can move on with your
day I also want to say that four of
these five products are not drugstores
so if you're more on the affordable side
of things I'm going to mention the very
first product which is a cheaper product
so I wanted to let you know if you are
into affordable skin care or if that's
just more in your budget I totally get
it I have my elf skincare video my best
and worst of what they offer and they
have some amazing products and I will
link that below so that you can kind of
get your feet wet when it comes to more
affordable skin care but otherwise if
you're going to stick with me let's get
into it so the first product as promised
is my drugstore product I have bought
this like eighty thousand times probably
like seven times so that was an
exaggeration obviously this is the serum
a hydrating cleanser oh my gosh it's for
normal to dry skin this stuff feel
unless I don't know how to explain it I
never try to cleanser like this and I've
tried so many high-end ones and so many
drugstore ones but this is one that is
withstood the test of time you you know
you pump a little bit like maybe two
pumps into your hands what I'll usually
do is put it on my face and then I'll
get my hands wet and start wetting my
face inches lathering it in and it does
such an amazing job of getting off any
makeup residue but it also hydrates your
skin and when you first use it you'll
know exactly what I mean
and if you use this before sound off
below because there's no way I can't
find the words to describe how it feels
when you start adding water to it but
so moisturizing it feels like you're
taking a lotion and and washing it into
your face it's the weirdest thing but it
does an amazing job of cleaning your
face but also moisturizing at the same
time I've never found a product like it
if you have any other recommendations
let me know below but this is the balm
for dry skin for normal skin I don't
think you'd love it if you have oily
skin like I said but it's amazing so my
next favorite is the way that I get my
makeup off every single night this is
like the fourth one of these that I have
owned I think I bought my first one and
then it cosmetics sent me my second one
and then I bought my third and fourth
fluffens this is the it cosmetics bye
bye makeup it's this cleansing ball it's
the weirdest thing I just opened this
one the other day I feel like I fly
through it which stinks because it's you
know it's not like crazy high-end
expensive but it's not cheap by any
means but you all usually with dry hands
dry face I'll just get my hand in it get
a little gloss and I will rub it all
over my face first and I'll get a little
bit more and do my eyes really gently so
it's not you know you're not pulling on
your skin and that's why I like it but
you just rub it on your face and then
again you get warm water and just splash
it all over and it removes everything
but again it doesn't dry your skin out
because it really is oily base and I
always follow it up with a cleanser of
some type typically this one but it's so
amazing because first of all it's not
drying your skin out and second of all
it's not like it's like a cleansing
wipes like for example I have these out
I wiped swatches off with these these
are the Guardian ones but I feel like
with the towelette you're like rubbing
at your skin a little bit more than you
probably should especially to come to
your eye region where you're so likely
to get wrinkles and fine lines etc this
is such an amazing product because
you're not using anything but your
fingers and you're just gently rubbing
and within like one two three four five
six your makeup is gone like it is so
amazing oh my gosh the next process so
amazing I can't believe I've lived this
long without it and I want to shout it
from the rooftops
how much I love this product this is the
first
Korres products I've ever tried but sent
to me from octiline which is the site if
you don't know about I think even if
you're not a youtuber you can do it I'm
not sure but i will put my i have a
referral link for it it's not a
sponsorship or anything like that but
it's a referral link for Offaly but this
karez the Greek yogurt was sent to me
from that it picked it out from my like
free store and when you join you'll know
what I mean you can pick out free
products and then you just share about
it like on your social media or
something like that like I usually share
about these on my Instagram for example
but oh my gosh it's a sleeping mask and
if you've never used one of those before
you just open it it's just the cream you
put it all over your face as if it's a
moisturizer you let it sink in you know
you don't put like a stick go off like a
regular mask it you'd wash off this you
put on like a moisturizer but you go to
sleep and it does its work overnight my
skin looked so amazing every morning
I've used I try not to use it too often
because again it's more expensive and
you know I don't want to overdo it but I
use this two to three times a week and
it makes my skin the mornings I wake up
after this I think I use it like twice a
week it just is like you know what I
mean like I wake up and I look in the
mirror and I'm like I don't have redness
all over my cheeks like I normally do my
nose doesn't look crazy oily and red
like all those little imperfections that
I hate this takes care of so this is the
karez Greek yogurt advanced nourishing
sleeping facial and oh my gosh the next
product number four is the Scandinavian
post makeup recovery spray this one is
much newer to me however this is amazing
so the idea of this is and I've
mentioned this in videos before but I
want to mention again in case you're new
to my channel or whatever but
Scandinavia does not make many products
at all
they are very picky about what they make
and what they put out and that is why I
love this brand because they're like no
we're not just going to jump on the next
bandwagon and put something out that's
crappy just because it's trendy right
now
no they take their time they perfect the
formula and then they put it out and
this is their post make up recovery
spray distance to me a while ago but
I've been using it because I was just
intrigued by it and I was kind of
skeptical because the idea is wash your
face get your makeup off and they say
after five minutes of removing your
makeup you're supposed to spray this all
over your face
now Scandinavia is known for their
setting sprays that's why I have heard
of them that's why I love them their
makeup finishing spray I repurchase like
a six times but this is different
because it's more like I mean I guess
it's all skin care but this is more like
skin care on its own not to be used with
makeup necessarily and so I was really
intrigued by it but I sprayed it on and
after a few minutes I look to myself
knows like the redness that I have after
I wash my face was gone clearly that's a
big problem for me and I just it was
refreshing and cooling but not only that
but you could see a visible difference
now I don't know if it has long-term
benefits the same with any of these I
don't know I mean you'd never know until
you're like much older and you look back
and think wow I'm glad I use that
product to the made a difference but I
do know that it feels good it has
instant results that look really nice
and again the next morning it just looks
really my skin looks great so I love
this and it's one of those things that
you know I don't know where you put this
in your skincare regimen like if you do
toners and exfoliants and moisturizers
and serums I feel like this would be
similar to a toner in a way but it's a
spray-on toner and I wish more tolerance
would be like that but I really really
like it this next product I love so much
and I hope you don't roll your eyes
because I did a sponsor video with them
and I know a lot of you guys are like oh
it's sponsored I don't know if you're
telling the truth I hope you guys know
that whether I was sent the products or
not I get sent a ton of products that I
hate and I tell you that I hate them so
that doesn't that doesn't sway me at all
I get sent enough I could buy what I
want it doesn't matter but this is one
that I had tried years ago and loved
because takia recommend
this video like I said they have no idea
I'm filming it I'm not even going to
tell them I'm filming it I'm curious if
they even watch the rest of my videos
but it's this be nygma cream this stuff
is the most moisturizing stuff but it is
very expensive and when you go to their
website it will - really good icky and
that was my first thought I was like
what the heck like you click on the link
below you'll see what I mean like it's
very gimmicky it looks like an
infomercial straight up I'll tell you
the truth but it's made from bee venom
which I learned I did some research it
does not harm to be shoes and look on
their website like it's a very safe
practice doesn't harm the bees at all it
doesn't kill them I mean there's no
harming of these because I know about
the population issue etc but it smells
like honey and stuff like that
but it has manuka honey bee venom and
shea butter this is the most
moisturizing product I have ever used
like you put it on your skin and you're
like oh my gosh what is the product that
this is the second jar I've had and the
more I use it the better my skin look
when I did that video and they gave me a
discount code I think it's still good
I'm telling you guys this is really
expensive but they gave me a 25% off
code I will link it's actually a link
I'll link it below and you'll see what I
need about the website but it is amazing
so if you if you've got dry skin or
you're starting to age maybe you're like
I'm 28 maybe you're in your late 20s
early 30s 40 50 60 whatever and you feel
like I want to do something really good
for my skin I'm telling you guys I've
tried so many products and none of them
are as moisturizing as this one is where
I feel like I'm really doing something
anti-aging for my skin you can say what
you want the comments this is not
sponsored I feel like I need to
re-emphasize that a million times I
genuinely love this product in all of
the products that I've mentioned so
those are my top 5 skin care products I
hope that this is helpful for you if you
have any recommendations for me or
anyone else please let me know down
below I'm always down for trying new
products I just ordered a bunch of
products
from glossier if you've ever heard of
them I'm just so curious they're very
new they only have a couple products but
there are few products are like highly
recommended here on YouTube so I'm
curious to see like is it worth the hype
or not so stay tuned for that definitely
subscribe down below if you are curious
to see my thoughts on glossier and so
many other products if you like makeup
as well as you drugstore and high-end
makeup reviews and if they're worth the
money or not I hope that you will check

is right down on the screen other than
that I will catch you guys in my next
