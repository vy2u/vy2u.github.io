sharing with you guys what I brought in
my travel makeup bag when I went on a
trip to Disney World
and then we went down to Miami and went
on a cruise to Cozumel Mexico where we
saw the Mayan ruins which was awesome
the Bahamas the Grand Cayman Islands and
also Jamaica so let's go ahead and get
into it
there's no I'm always up front with you
guys when I'm doing a sponsored video
and this video was sponsored by
Scandinavia now I don't accept sponsored
videos from companies that I don't
believe in then you guys buy now if
you've been watching me long enough to
know that so one that I really do love
is Scandinavia this is their makeup
finishing spray and I I wish I could
show you I'm literally down to here at
this point with this I use this stuff
like crazy and I brought this with me
and I use it every single day of my life
because I feel like since I have normal
to kind of dry skin my skin can just
tend to look a little like blah and so I
like to wear aluminized products and I
like you know anything that can recreate
kind of that glow on my face I love and
I think it kind of makes me look even
more youthful so with this I love it
because it it doesn't really give a glow
but what it does is it holds on to
whatever you've done to your face but it
also takes away any powder enos that you
have going on and I brought it with me
I'm going to show you how it works here
in a second I brought it with me because
I knew I'd be sweating a lot and for
like especially when went to the Mayan
ruins that was the time where when we
went to the beach I didn't really wear
makeup at all
in fact I didn't wear makeup at all but
like when we go to the Mayan ruins so
much we're going to take pictures we're
gonna do some videos there be flog the
entire trip if you wanted to see if it's
on time this channel shameless plug but
I knew that I wanted when I did my
makeup I didn't want it to sweat off and
I know I can trust this so the way I
apply it the nozzle is actually really
really good I always shake it before
just to make sure it's all mixed up and
and I kind of pull my hair out of my
face and then I just spray it everywhere
like tons and it's a really fine mist so
you never have like weird bluffs like
I've used a few other brands and I feel
like they're like klopse
everywhere and so then like it just
never looks even but this actually
really is even so it feels refreshing
but not only that it actually holds your
makeup in place so I love this stuff I
also have their primer spray I didn't
bring that with me but I do like that a
lot too because me I don't wear primers
every day because I feel like it clogs
my pores whether it does or it doesn't I
don't know but with the spray I like it
because I hold on to my foundation but
it doesn't feel like it's a thick layer
over my skin so I really do like their
spray as well but the finishing spray
really is my favorite allergy season is
starting and I'm already feeling it
I'm feeling the effects so speaking of
face one of the things that I brought
with me is this it cosmetics your skin a
better CC plus illumination now everyone
talks about the CC cream that they sell
and it really is nice but this one but
the illumination is my favorite I'm
wearing it today and again I feel like
it just makes me look glowy now for
everyday I feel like it almost is to
glowy
but for something like that where it's a
trip where I'm in the Sun and it has SPF
of 50 or even at night like when I
wanted to look glowy this was perfect
but I think for everyday I don't know if
I would trust this because I think it's
a little too illuminating but I loved it
on the trip and of course I'm wearing
today and I think again I think it makes
my skin look just a little bit glowy
without looking like too much so I love
this and I love it it has a pump I
should probably mention this makeup bag
that I have is from Disney worlds that
I'm such a nerd and this is a beer
brownie bag but it's from Disney World
so you'll notice there's like Mickey's
head throughout anyway so I got two
eyeshadow palettes with me the first one
I brought is my Sephora Z palette if
you've been watching my recent videos
you know about this I love the palette
itself it's pretty inexpensive from
Sephora but the shallow center are matte
shadows and makeup geek shadows and
carroty shadows I love them all so much
I'm wearing
today actually if you're curious about
what charity and Mac shadows I have I
have a video on the ones that I really
liked the dupes I have I'll link below
but other than that it's just a mix of
my favorites so for me travel wise this
is great however I will say that some of
these like this one from makeup geek
called shimma shimma which is like my
favorite I'm wearing on my lids today it
was already a little bit broken because
it's so soft and it broke even more and
got all throughout on the two legs of my
trip that we had so that kind of stunk
the good news is it didn't break
completely but you know the other pad I
brought is my old standby the Too Faced
natural ice palette and I just love it
there's enough matte enough shimmer you
can do anything with this and I love it
I can't talk highly enough about it I
also brought for my face the it
cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination now I have mine in the
shade light I actually have the shade
fair as well but I just sold it on
Poshmark because it was just too light
for me but light is pretty good I feel
like I can go one shade up right now
based on you know I did get some Sun
there even though I was wearing like SPF
55 anyway I love this stuff because it
gives you higher coverage if you're
wearing like a BB cream or maybe you're
wearing nothing but you want a little
bit of something it gives you really
high coverage but it makes you look
glowy still it's the weirdest thing I
love it
sorry this is like in the most random
order I also brought my hourglass the
ambient lighting palette and this is so
good you guys I know
let everyone talks about it but this
isn't like I mean it's way past its
prime of when it came out and it is so
good now I almost wish it were a duo
because I never used the bronzer okay
it's not a bronzer shade but the more
orange tone I never used these two I
used this one which is dim like
everywhere I use it all over my face I
used it today and then the one in the
middle which is incandescent light I use
just on my cheekbones and sometimes got
my nose and then I never really used
that one but they just make your skin
look flawless like there's no pores that
the light is coming from
within I mean it is just incredible
worth every penny I love it
the only bronzer I brought is the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and I
know this is really big right now and
everyone's talking about it but smells
like coconuts first of all it's got the
most adorable like Saved by the Bell
early 90s packaging and it really is a
nice light bronzer if you have light
skin like I do if you're darker than I
am I don't think it would show up at all
because it is not a deep bronzer I mean
you can barely see it when I swatch it
but I used it today and it really can
add some color because the SPF on my
face I reapplied like every freaking 20
minutes so I got no color on my face
like maybe a little bit and so to make
it match the rest of my skin I really
did need to use bronzer so this was a
saving grace and I will love it another
thing I brought is this Yves Saint
Laurent YSL Touche clock blur Perfector
I almost got rid of this quite a while
ago I got it in an influencer box and I
almost got rid of it cuz I wasn't sure
how to use it but it really is like a
weird like bomb but what you can do with
it is get a little bit on your finger
and tap it anywhere you feel like you
have an oil slick and it mattifies it
without adding any powder and I think
that is so ingenious and they came of
like this little pop I've since gotten
rid of because it would get the
foundation on the puff and I'm like like
just grossed me out
but of course my finger is not much
better but it at least applies a little
bit easier for me and I just really like
it also the packaging really is cute and
I'm so glad in the end I had it in the
declutter pile and I'm so glad I pulled
it out because it has become a favorite
for me because in the summer you want to
be you know if you're crazy oily you
don't want to look that oily but you
also don't want to look all powder in
the Sun so this is the perfect
in-between and I love it the only blush
I brought is actually kind of bronzer
like it's the NYX HD blush and nude tude
and what I love about it is it's kind of
this peach tone I'm again wearing it
today it doesn't look like I'm wearing
blush and that is what I loved about it
because it makes it look like I've maybe
got a little bit of Duffin
in here but nothing like I'm trying too
hard and it really is almost a bronzer
color but it does have a little bit of a
peach pull to it and for my skin tone it
just works really well now the NYX HD
blushes are notorious for kicking up a
lot of powder which really is not that
big of a deal if you kind of tap it off
before you apply it and they're really
inexpensive it not it stays on all day
and again it's a color for my skin tone
that when I apply it I could put on
layer after layer and it would never
look clown like and I love that so I
also brought this Mac Paint Pot and soft
ochre and it's just kind of a yellow
tone neutral shade and I use this as my
eye primer as like a cream shadow
underneath just to kind of cancel out
any redness any veiny and just make
everything look even on my eye area and
I love this stuff it fits the balm and
it lasts forever so it really is worth
the money the only conceals I brought
was something just really light I
brought the Maybelline better skin
concealer I have fallen in love with
this stuff because it's really really
light it's just a doe foot applicator I
think I just have it yeah an ivory but
it blends so easily into your skin and
it doesn't look weird or cakey or
powdery or anything like that and I love
that because when you're on a beach
vacation you don't want to look like
again like you're trying too hard or
anything like that but it does lighten
the area it's perfect so I had a story
about mascaras I brought this mascara
which is the l'oreal voluminous hydro
fuge which is their waterproof now I
love the L'Oreal voluminous mascara the
waterproof I don't love it really is
just very different but I bought it cuz
I thought well you know I like it well
enough and I wanted something waterproof
in case I do want to wear mascara where
I'll get wet in the end I didn't really
anyway but and again I didn't love it
however while we were on the ship they
had a makeup store heaven again that'll
be in our vlog where I'm shopping there
but I bought the Lancome Hypnose mascara
now the Hypnose drama is my favorite
mascara of all time out of anything ever
but the hypnosis is pretty close it's
got kind of a natural bristle brush it
kind of bows in a little
not much but just a little bit I'm
wearing it today it is a really nice
volumizing mascara it holds a curl I
think they have no Strama is a little
bit better it's a little bit more
dramatic but I like both a lot so I'm
still using this but this is what I
ended up using like the last half of the
trick eyeliner wise I had three because
I always layer them
I brought the Milani liquid eye eyeliner
pencil in black and it's just a creamy
pencil liner I always tight line with it
kind of between my lashes it's so good
it stays put and then on top of that I
use a gel liner which I had this I ran
out and the subscribers sent this to me
it's the mica beauty cosmetics
gel liner and black I just love this
stuff it doesn't budge it goes on easily
I love it so much and then on top of
that I know it's kind of ridiculous I
wear my favorite Stila stay all day
liquid eyeliner in black for intense
black it is just the bomb it's I've said
that too much it's got a felt tip to it
it's so easy to do a winged liner I used
it today I used all three of these today
as usual know a lot of you guys asked
how I do like my demi wing and it's
always with this how you do everything
else with those other two but to get the
actual wing I use this because it's so
precise it's so easy to use and it does
not move for my brows I use two products
and I use them today as well this is the
Maybelline brow satin sometimes called
the define and fill and it's got a
pencil on one side I've talked about
this like crazy and a like sponge on the
other side to kind of fill in with
powder which I love and then to kind of
brush it out and hold it in place
I used the Bhoots number seven lash +
brow Perfector and I love the spoolie on
this it's just really really small now
it's kind of getting gross and brown
because it's brushing through Brown
powder but I really it holds them in
place I don't think it's as good as like
the anastacio because that stuff is
literally like hairspray for your brows
but this is still really good but mostly
I just love the spoolie how it's small
and angled you can really like shape
your brows with it last thing is lips I
brought five different products I
brought two lip liners one
read this is urban decay mrs. Mia
Wallace this is from the pulp fiction
collection I think I bought it on
HauteLook for like really cheap and it's
just a really good red lip liner and it
does not move and then I also brought
the Mac staunchly stylish and it's their
Pro Longwear and this one is so pretty
it's just a neutral pink
I recently hauled this in that hall from
Canada from The Canadian subscribers Sam
and I loved it I ended up bringing it
with me so to go with that I brought my
Rimmel lip stick and airy-fairy which is
just this really classic like light pink
I wore it honestly I wore this almost
every single night and I wore it with
the Rimmel stay glossy lip gloss in
blushing Belle graves and it's just like
a really pretty light pink sometimes I
call it a gray pink because that is so
what it is but it's my favorite lip
gloss of all time
the only lipgloss I brought and then the
last thing I brought I'm sure you can
say it with me was the Marc Jacobs
lipstick in Oh Miley I talk about it
constantly this was to go with that red
lip liner from Urban Decay it's just the
best red lipstick I've ever owned ever
hopefully this video was enjoyable for
you guys I hope that you'll subscribe to
catch more of my makeup videos I will
have links and everything down below for
all of the products that I mentioned and
I will catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
