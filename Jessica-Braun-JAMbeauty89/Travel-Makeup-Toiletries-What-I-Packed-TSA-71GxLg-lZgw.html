going to share with you guys what I'm
bringing on vacation with me
and so it's an everyday makeup drawer
because this is what I will be wearing
everyday for the next like half of a
month
well we gone for about two weeks in
Disney World so as you're watching this
we are probably they're not sure when
I'm editing and uploading this but we
leave tomorrow as of the filming time so
I'm actually packing my makeup in one of
these things I don't remember what
they're called but I saw it like on an
ad on Facebook you know how they like
Target things to you so I saw it I was
like what it's one of those makeup bags
where it can lay flat but then you like
cinch it together and it pulls
everything together and they have like
black I think pink I like the leopard I
thought was kind of cute I'm going to
show you what's in here so that's all
the makeup and brushes I'm bringing with
me but then I'm also going to show you
what's in my bag that I'm carrying on
with my liquids and stuff so like what
shampoo and conditioner face wash all
that good stuff anything I mentioned
will be linked below or at least listed
including like this bag I just bought it
on Amazon and I really like it because I
was kind of looking for one of those
clear bags that's TSA approved with this
which this one is that are a little bit
more stylish and really well made I had
one but I just build stuff and it got
kind of gross but this one actually is
like really really nice so let's go
ahead I'm going to zoom in and show you
and I'm breathe so this is the makeup
I'm bringing you'll see it looks all
disheveled because I just undid this
little piece where when you do that it
kind of bunches it together and that's
why this is so amazing of course I can
organize it a little bit better before I
actually pack it but I just wanted you
guys to get the kind of the general gist
of this cuz I just thought this was so
neat and if you travel a lot I mean this
is fantastic even if you like take your
makeup to work with you whatever so let
I'm just gonna kind of randomly go
through it some of this stuff will be in
my clear plastic bag here that I'm going
to show you in a minute so it'll get
transported to that but I figured I'd
keep all the makeup together for this
video first thing primer I'm bring in
the makeup forever step one hydrating
primer I like it I've only been using it
a couple weeks but I do like it
so that's coming with me this is the
foundation if you will that I'll be
using
it cosmetics CC cream in light I love
that it has SPF of 50 it's got really
good coverage but it looks natural it's
perfect for theme parks next thing I'm
trying to an order of like how I
actually apply it well this is the lip
balm that I'm bringing with me it's from
Hanalei I got it an Ipsy bag and so this
is coming with me for sure I talked
about it in my may favorites this is my
favorite powder foundation by it
cosmetics I have it in the shade light
it's the celebration foundation
illumination and it just has good
coverage but it looks like breathable
and kind of natural when you wear it and
I just love it it looks not matte but
kind of like satin it's so beautiful
the bronzer I'm bringing is from Too
Faced it's their chocolate Soleil
bronzer I actually just got all of their
bronzers in the mail from them and I
really haven't tried them out but I know
I've tried this one I used to own it and
I really liked it so I'm bringing it
with me the blush that I'm bringing I'm
actually only bringing one I'm pretty
proud of that
is this City color blush it's their be
matte in blackberry we'll see if one
tomorrow when I'm like leaving for the
airport if I change my mind because I'm
like I want to bring another like a
luminous blush as well but I love this
it's just a really beautiful natural
pink color yeah look it it's washed I
just think it's so pretty um for
highlight I'm bringing this hourglass
one in luminous light I actually for a
while had this in a pile of things I
regretted buying but I recently just
randomly started using it again and I
fell in love with it and I don't know
what I was thinking before it's got a
little bit of glitter which initially
turned me off but in the end it just
ends up looking so beautiful oh my gosh
just so beautiful on the face separate
what I've talked about from what I have
it um okay I shadow wise I'm bringing my
Naked palette I never bring giant
palettes like this well I shouldn't say
never I'm sure I do plenty of times but
I feel like I don't often travel with
straight up palettes I usually bring
like things where I pick out whatever
colors but I've recently been getting
into this palette again and I was like
I'm just going to bring it it's got such
an amazing selection but I'm also
supplementing it with these four colors
some of these are from makeup geek some
of these are
from Mac I some of them are from caridy
I'm pretty sure so I will link my
playlists where I talk about the Mac and
karate'd oops because I mentioned most
of these in that if you're curious about
what ones but I felt like these were
colors that weren't necessarily in the
Naked palette ah the concealer I'm
bringing this is the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer I just love it i have it in NC
15
this stuff lasts forever and it just
looks amazing on and I just love it I
always travel with it bring in a pencil
sharpener I need to empty it before I
take it this is the color pop pop shadow
in lovely and it is absolutely lovely
it's just as gorgeous like kind of
golden beige color and it looks you can
put it alone you can put it on top of
shadow and it'll still stay I just love
it I'm also bringing this nail polish
it's what I have on my toes getting my
nails a break but I'm bringing this for
my toes in case I need a touch-up over
the next two weeks while on vacation I'm
also bringing some nail polish remover
pads these are really really good ones
by Lauren B that I really like I'm also
bringing this everyday minerals
concealer powder it's their multitasking
mineral concealer and it just provides a
lot of coverage and kind of sets the
under eye area and it also brightens it
I just love it I don't usually use this
in the midday Sun but I like it at night
just kind of brighten that area and look
a little more put together I'm also
bringing a Mac Paint Pot in painterly I
was torn between painterly and soft
ochre they both work on my skin tone but
painterly is getting a little old and I
wanted to use it up so I'm bringing this
one with me it's kind of my eye primer
if you will I'm also for my brows I
actually just got this this is the
Anastasia brow definer and medium brown
it's a triangle brow pencil it's kind of
shaped more like a triangle and it's
great because it fills in your brows
quicker than their normal brow is does
which I really like and then of course
it's got a spoolie on the other end so
I've tried it the past few days I really
like it so I'm going to go ahead and
bring it with me and also the Anastasia
clear brow gel which I just repurchase I
absolutely love it just really holds
your brows in place no matter how sweaty
or what you get from like water rides
whatever I'm also bringing this Stila
smudge pot in black and it's a
waterproof gel eyeliner it's really
really creamy almost too creamy but I
want to continue to try it clearly it's
pretty new to me
and this is one of those things that you
know I don't have to have a gel eyeliner
so if I end up hating it after a few
days I could just use these eyeliners so
this is the pencil eyeliner I'm bringing
it's by Lancome and it's their drama
liquid pencil and noir intense and it's
just an amazing pencil liner does not
move but I'm also bringing the Stila
stay all day waterproof liquid liner
that I love it's a black felt tip liner
it really does not budge mascara I'm
bringing this covergirl super sizer the
wand is really weird I thought I would
hate it I absolutely love it my lashes
are so volumize with this I am so
impressed
I'm also bringing this wet and wild
color icon single shadow in Brule it's
just a really good matte shadow and it's
so good for under the brow bone for my
lips all I'm bringing other than that
thing from earlier I showed you I'm
bringing this Maybelline color blur in
I'm blushing just a really pretty matte
lip color and I figure you know if we're
going out it oh my gosh look at that if
we're going out at night and I want just
something a little more on my lips I can
grab this I'm also bringing for every
day this Burt's Bees one in blush Basin
I can't stop talking about it it's just
comfortable to wear you know as it wears
off it doesn't look crazy and I just
love it
I can't stop using it I'm also bringing
this Edward best lipstick in rose to
Muir this is actually what I wore my
wedding day and it's just one of my
favorites it's one of my husband's
favorites on me as well so I figure
we're there we're going to be
celebrating our one-year anniversary as
well so I figured I would bring this
it'll Maj to that and wear it when we go
out that night I think everything else
is brushes so I'm bringing my Sephora
eyelash curler and I bought in Paris
that I love I'm bringing some tweezers
from tweezerman
and then I'm bringing like a lash comb
I'm bringing in a bunch of Sonia Kashuk
brushes because I just love them these
are like this is their number 29 brush
it's I use it for blush this is their
number one brush I use it for both
bronzer and for powder and then I'm
bringing the number two brush which I
also use like kind of a contour more for
bronzer
um this little furless brush I don't
know what number it is
BC for maybe I use to set my under eye
area this Sedona lace FBO 7 is the
softest brush I own and I'm using it for
my foundation or BB cream if you will
this this is a diva beauty one and bo6
it's their pointed contour I actually
use to blend my concealer in so I'm
bringing that and then for my eyes just
kind of a random smattering Sedona lace
EB 11 for kind of using I actually use
this for under my brow bone this morphe
brush M for one two I use for my crease
this elf crease brush is one of my
favorites for more detailed crease this
cara de 25 I use just for like my lower
lash line with a darker shadow the Mac
224 I used to blend everything together
it's nice and fluffy and then this cara
de 22 I mentioned in my may favorites is
perfect for eyeliner it's like $3 it's
amazing so you'll notice in this makeup
holder there's like this piece where I
can put stuff into it they also have
this part where you could stick like
brush it while I'd be more for a bigger
brush I could stick brushes in it if I
wanted so I haven't decided if I'm
actually gonna use this portion or not
cuz honestly I have more brushes than
that but I'm really excited about this
now this let me see if I can get it all
these to this I think that's about it
those need to go oh this as well in my
liquids bag so those will be moves
usually cream products like the gel
liner
I've never gotten stopped for those so
I'm probably not going to put in like
liquid liner it's not really I mean it's
liquid but not really so I've never
gotten stopped by not putting them in
the thing so these are the ones that are
gonna move to my clear bag for the TSA
so this bag is by the lux ace I have no
idea I bought it on Amazon I'll link it
below I actually put a Disney charm on
it I bought it's like the little castle
I just put I have a couple charms and I
put him on a lot of things that was my
mother-in-law's idea she puts cute
charms on a lot of things so um I bought
this on Amazon like I said it was
pricier than like you know just a court
size ziplock but it's gonna last
for a long time so I'll link it below I
love it I don't remember I think this
might have been the only color they had
but I just really liked it so these are
where I'm gonna put these as well let's
make sure they fit I'm thinking they
will oh yeah no problem and there's
plenty of room so if I end up wanting to
put ok I end up wanting to put like a
lip gloss cuz I'm just now realizing I
didn't bring a lip gloss I could put it
in here and be fine so I'm gonna take
those out since you already know about
those and let's talk about the other
things in here so I picked up the
Jergens natural glow firming plus daily
moisturizer um it's the medium to tan I
really just needed a lotion I saw this
one I was like well that'll give me a
little I'm pretty fair-skinned and so I
can put this on my legs and then if I
run out the hotel will have it have
lotion but I figure it's nice to have
this at the beginning so I can feel like
I've got a little color and then
throughout the week I'll probably get a
little bit of color on my legs walking
through the parks um I'm also bringing
this Kota levy no source intense
moisture rescue cream this stuff is just
really nice I've been using it for a
couple weeks now and it's just a really
moisturizing moisturizer so I really
like it I'm also bringing this first day
beauty face cleanser it's the perfect
size it's 2 ounces although it looks
like there's a lot doesn't it and it's
just a really gentle cleanser so I know
I can trust that I'll be fine using this
on the trip these actually were mailed
to me this brand sent me a bunch of
stuff this is by OGX which used to be
called organics and it's their thick
thick in full biotin and collagen
shampoo conditioner they actually put
these on there when they mailed it
little tape so it doesn't open and I
thought oh my gosh I'm leaving those on
there that's genius for when you travel
I thought that was so cute so I mean I
actually haven't tried this but I figure
you know again they have shampoo and
conditioner in the hotel I'm bringing
these just because we if I end up hating
it I know I'll have these and these will
probably be a little bit better
we'll see also bringing crest 3d white
toothpaste time and I now bring our own
one we're gone for two weeks because
we've run out and so instead of you know
sharing one and then running out we just
each bring your own and then it
we end up being fine this is the not
your mother's whip it up cream styling
mousse I use mousse when I do my hair
curly and I've done a tutorial using a
different brand of mousse but this one
is pretty good it's not my favorite but
I liked it was travel size so I could
still wear my hair kind of naturally
curly since it's gonna rain a lot while
we're there it's gonna be like 95
degrees and humid I figure if my hair is
curly I don't need to worry about it if
it rains it's still gonna be curly so
that'll be fine so I figured I bring
products this is actually Rusk wired
flexible styling cream I use for my
naturally curly hair as well it's again
not my favorite but I had a bunch and I
was like well I'll just put it in this
little container I got from Target and
I'll have that so I usually use this
first then this and then blow-dry my
hair with the diffuser so I'm also
bringing this redken hair spray it's
their wind blow no 5 I just have it I've
used it a couple times it's pretty good
I'm also bringing the Oribe dry
texturizing spray I love using
texturizing spray is when I put my hair
up like in buns like today just because
it helps me have a little bit more grip
in my hair and this one's amazing it's
like half gone um this is what I'm going
to use to clean off my makeup this is
the Burt's Bees cleansing oil and it's
just so easy because you really don't
need anything with it you just put some
on your hands rub it on your eyes and
get the eye makeup off and then I can
just use my face cleanser to get
everything else off so this is for when
I don't wear my hair curly this is the
Moroccan oil treatment just a really
small size just to keep my ends together
and healthy when I blow-dry it this is
the serum I'm bringing one of my
favorites the polished choice resist
super antioxidant concentrate serum I
just love this stuff it's almost gone
you can tell so I'll need to repurchase
but you guys know I love Paula's choice
this is another lip balm I'm bringing in
case I run out of the Hanalei because
there's a good chance I will this is the
CL Bigelow my favorite night balm it's
one of my favorites very thick very
moisturizing also bringing some eye
drops and then I'm bringing whoops it
fell my perfume this is a little travel
oh these are like ten bucks and amazing
you guys I used to have a different
brand I think it was like flow or
something but you have to like spray it
into
thing and sit like literally literally
spray it and so the air would hit it
before it even gets in the container and
so it'd be a completely different smell
by the time I use it with this you
actually take the thing off the sprayer
off of your actual perfume stick it into
this and it's going straight into the
bottle so there's no chance of air
hitting it and it's just amazing they
have all different colors my husband
Tyler has I think a black one and I have
the gold one they are incredible oh my
gosh so the only thing I really don't
have in here toiletry wise is my
toothbrush my deodorant because it's
like a full-size and you don't really
have to put deodorant in here um and
that's pretty much it I mean I think
this is literally everything I'm
bringing and I was so excited that I was
able to fit it all in here so easily so
hopefully that was enjoyable for you
guys like I said everything mentioned is
at least listed and hopefully linked
below I don't know how much work I want
to put into it while I'm on vacation but
I still like editing videos so I
typically still do that while I'm on
vacation I just can't help it if you
have any questions about you know what
items you can carry on what you can't
make up I would recommend for different
weather situations let me know down
below if I can't answer it right away I
know there's a lot of people here in
