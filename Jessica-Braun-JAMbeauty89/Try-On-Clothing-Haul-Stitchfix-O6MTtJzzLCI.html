sharing with you my next stitch fix try
on haul so this box if you don't know
about it I'll link my other previous
videos where I explain it more in detail
but basically it's a clothing fashion
subscription box where there's a stylist
that you know you can tell them I need a
black cardigan this time I need this
kind of flats these kinds of pants they
can look through the collection they
have and send you things that they think
fit what you need want and also of
course your sizes body type etc the only
caveat is that there's a twenty dollar
styling fee and within that 20 dollar
styling fee if you do buy something they
apply that amount towards what you're
buying but if you decide I don't want
any of the five items they sent then you
still lose that twenty dollars so it
kind of behooves you to buy at least one
thing they also have an incentive where
if you buy all five items you get a big
chunk off like I think it's twenty
percent off so it's kind of one of those
things where if you're gonna buy four of
the items you own it would almost even
out if you just buy the fifth one
because you get that discount it ends up
being around the same price you know
what I mean
I've already peeked through this one and
to be honest with you guys I wasn't very
impressed this time around the last two
times I have loved everything I think I
I keep I'm very specific in what I'm
asking for and since their collection is
limited I think that you know she's
trying to get what I asked for but some
of it's just not quite right and you'll
see what I mean
but it would look cute on other people
so I'm gonna still continue this on but
this time I will lay it list the prices
I know a lot of you guys asked about
that in the past videos I don't know I
had thrown away the card and you can't
see it once you've like checked out how
much it was and so I'm like man I have
no idea so for this one I will list it
below you're welcome
let's start with some of the things that
I really wanted to love this was this
blazer and it's got this you know nice
royal blue with a cream design to be
honest it just kind of reminded me of
Michael Jackson in like that's not
really my style kind of a thing and it
just didn't fit well on my body type so
I love the royal blue I don't love the
design on it and it just wasn't quite
right so this is one I know I'm going to
return for sure this next one I feel
like I'm sorry I'm like starting on like
a
one this next one was this white with
black and kind of gray floral design
throughout and I'd wanted a floral like
bomber jacket if you guys have seen
those is that what it is isn't really a
bomber kind of and she said they didn't
really have any of those yet but she
thought I might like this and I just
really don't it's really boxy on me and
I I'm already short as it is in my
abdomen
that area is also really short so
anything boxy really makes me just look
bigger than I am so I just didn't love
this either it's just too big I tried it
like a few different ways and I just did
not like it on my body type this is
actually really kind of cute it's by
Pixley which I'm realizing again every
month I've gotten something from that
brand and every time I've loved it this
is a black kind of a bomber jacket
really kind of has cinched at the sleeve
and at the waist
it's totally see-through I mean it's
like mesh but it's got a really cool
design and it's got a zipper it's just a
black zipper um this I think I'm gonna
keep because even though I just got a
black cardigan in my last box I wear a
lot of that kind of stuff as a teacher
so for me I feel like I actually would
get a lot of use out of this and I could
pair it with a bright color underneath
if I wanted so I'm pretty sure me to
keep that the next thing are the pants
now
I love skinny dress pants that's like
what I wear almost every single day but
I just don't like the color these are
kind of a tan which I did ask for a
khaki but I don't know these it's kind
of a maybe for me
I think they fit okay I don't think it's
perfect but it fits pretty well but
they're just it's a color that on my
skintone I feel like just washes me out
you guys know what I mean and so for me
I just don't love it it would have to be
paired with like the perfect top so this
is a maybe these were really cute though
I'd ask for like a fun like animal print
pair of shoes and these actually fit me
okay now I don't know that I'm gonna do
these on my feet right now because I
have I'm pretty sure broken my toe as of
a couple days ago so I'm hobbling around
I don't think it's actually broken I
think I've iced it and elevated it and
it's a little bit swollen but it's
definitely bruised and it hurts to walk
on it so
need to get her checked out but right
now I cannot wear these but I tried them
on when I first got this and they
actually do fit even though I have wider
feet it cuts it at just the right spot
that they fit so I'm pretty sure I'm
going to keep the shoes in the black
bomber jacket this is a maybe in the
other two our definite knows so like I
said all the prices are listed below
I'll have my referral link for this if
you are interested I feel like if you're
too specific and what you want you might
not get it but if you're kind of more
general I feel like they have more
wiggle room where they can really send
you some cute stuff so I think that's a
lesson for me like for this next month I
might just say I know I need like short
sleeve tops because I feel like I have
like two and so it's either like tank
tops or it's long sleeves so I need some
more just like I like cotton ones like I
have one that I love that I bought it
like Sam's Club I've worn it in a video
I love it so much I want like every
color but things like that just easy to
throw on kinds of items these items can
be pricey you can list on your original
like style profile how much you'd be
willing to pay for things but it still
seems to be that they all are generally
more expensive so if you know that
something not in your budget it might
not be worth it if you know that maybe
you can afford about 50 bucks and you
just want to buy one item each time
there's nothing wrong with that they
give you the bag to send everything back
with and it's already like creased
stamps you don't have to pay for the
shipping or anything like that you
literally just drop it in a mailbox so
they do make that easy which I
appreciate especially like this time
when I know I'm not gonna keep a lot of
it so if you are interested in this and
you want to see me showing products that
I absolutely love I'll link my past to
stitch fix videos other than that I hope
you'll subscribe if you enjoyed and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
