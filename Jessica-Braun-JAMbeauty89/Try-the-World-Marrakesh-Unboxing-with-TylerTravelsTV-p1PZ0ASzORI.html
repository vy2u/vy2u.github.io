you guys miss Jessica and today I'm with
my very very handsome fiance I still
want to thank goodness my handsome Tyler
and if you don't know wait you've been
on in a video on my channel one yeah
okay what was it called Tyler boyfriend
dag we will link that below if you're
interested in seeing that video it was
certainly a lot of fun to film and we
filmed that one at your place right yeah
anyway so a couple months ago yeah it
was there's still winter cuz winter is
never ending I feel like we live at the
wall in Game of Thrones
so beyond that today we are unboxing one
of my favorite subscription boxes and
one that is big for him because he is a
really good cook I am I'm pretty good
but he's way better he's a really good
cook and he what we both love to travel
and his channel is completely travel
centered so if you like travel you would
absolutely love his channel and I don't
care that I'm sluggin my fiance because
he is the bomb anyway it is the try the
world box and this month we do know the
country but we haven't actually looked
in sometimes they peek in but we like we
both opened it the other day and we saw
it was Marrakech and we were like oh and
then we were like no we're gonna wait
and we really did we've neither one of
us have peeked in which is very rare so
I'm excited neither of us have totally
well he definitely hasn't cuz it's been
here so there's no way I believe the
largest city in Morocco or know what
like the second or third largest city in
Morocco yeah right
it's like Casablanca Casablanca is
bigger is it anyway so I'm excited and
okay you should know that like our own
little only experience with Morocco or
Moroccan cuisine would be well there's
been to Disney World and Epcot
they have Morocco that's one of the
countries they have in their World
Showcase which is the best and we've
eaten at those restaurants and from what
we've heard those are pretty darn
authentic and they always have people
actually from those country
working there so they really I mean so
that was a delicious oh my gosh
but we've also made a Moroccan kneel
didn't we yeah whatever
yeah we always make I always forget that
you guys aren't with us all the time we
always make like almost all the time
that'd be fun you guys want us to start
daily vlogging put it down below maybe
we'll see what we can do Oh be hard that
will be very hard you know what it would
be easier though and a few months more
we're married we live together though
true but I don't know anybody would even
watch it would you guys watch it
well that's no I feel like I'm Dora the
Explorer do you want to watch it so try
the world if you don't know they are
there boxes have they used to be a lot
more expensive and thank goodness
they've heard our cries and they have
lower the price I don't even remember I
want to say it was like $50 before but
now it's like we were looking at how
they break it down and they basically
it's like if you just buy a box
it's $39 a month and you pay like
monthly but then like if you do it every
what is it six months yeah every six
months so you'd get three box because
it's every other month it's $35 a box in
the end and then yearly it's 33 a box so
if you know this is something that you
would love like we do and you like to
cook and you like travel I mean all of
this makes all free shipping - is it
that helps yeah oh yeah it makes you
have to pay that plus shipping that that
includes everything this box is sent to
us complimentary to review and of course
you guys know we could either show it or
not it's up to us but we are choosing to
show it each month because you how fun
is this it's so awesome it's right the
world the world is out there let's try
it that's like literally traylertravels
tv-ma no anyway okay
you ready yeah I'll hold it up you open
it up even though as if we haven't seen
the very top writers so here's the
culture guide for Marrakesh and when you
flip through then it goes like it will
show you like movies that are Moroccan
yeah you're like right right yeah so
like if you're doing like a whole dinner
with this stuff then you can have like a
movie to watch or yeah so let's go ahead
and dig in so this is don't look at the
card
sorry it's the informational card but we
don't want to go so we'll go so we'll
look at that as we go got it take some
of this Nickelodeon thrown on the floor
Anton's vacuum anyway ok let's start
right in Oh Ross ok gourmet Ross Elle
henna Moroccan spice blend this is the
great thing of my life do you want to
explain about our love of spices I'll
try we were literally you're doing it
wrong we love spices more than anything
in the world besides each other it
basically goes we love each other Disney
Disney dogs spice it's like really
that's the order yeah you know you get
going no no humans not know you can
start well it smells like curry well I
love about spices and I the reason I
cook with spices like it's my job like
if you think about it there's a piece a
piece of fish like yeah you couldn't fry
up some fish and then you can like dip
it in tartar sauce and whatever but if
you have the right spices you can make a
piece of fish tastes like a corm a piece
of fish without dipping in mayonnaise
and all that bad stuff for you and it's
really like a healthy way to eat is
through spices it makes your food
amazing without adding a bunch of stuff
to it yeah yeah it's it's funny because
thank you I looked up Moroccan cuisine
and it talked about the spices that are
typically used there and it mentioned
cinnamon coriander cumin turmeric
saffron a tonton that are actually in
there which i think is cool and if you
are from morocco and you're watching
this let us know what are your favorite
dishes from your cuisine because our
Moroccan meal I wish I can remember what
it was that we made but I remember it
was one of my favorite meals but I dunno
I'm sure we that app will use yummly
why you mmm ly that we use we save all
of it in there and are separate like
cuisine folders but I don't know it was
now but if you're from Rocco
first of all holy crap if you are from
Morocco let us know because we will die
little bit okay let's just come to it so
there's that there's this no okay no go
a little slower okay
culinary argan oil I'm gonna take over
this because argan oil is a typical it's
typically used in beauty products the
way that I know argan oil I put argan
oil in my beard I gave that argan oil no
you pahoehoe oil jojoba and argan and
there's inserts and I give you all of
them and I gave him a bunch of my oils
that I wasn't you and I just switched
through mine I put him in my beer
because they're all good for different
things
yeah do you use them welcome the burst
of flavor with the toasted nutty aroma
was interesting let's read let's read me
there why it's okay it does specifically
say it's the brand dip and scoop and it
says culinary argan oil yeah so
wonderful this unique and flavorful oil
is handmade by Berber women in
southwestern Morocco the same body
boosting antioxidants that sustain the
Argan tree in its desert environment I
had no idea was a desert plant can be
found in every bottle of oil dedicated
to the health and satisfaction the
customers dip and scoop provides itself
uh top off your fish dishes grilled
vegetables or uses a dip for your flat
friend topic you don't cook in this like
you don't put it in and cook it at you
top it well especially when there's just
my noodle right it says a well-balanced
burst of flavor with a toasted nutty
aroma you can see that it's interesting
that all this is in English some of
these will get and there's a very little
English on the packaging these are all
in English so far but so far the two
we've opened says pretty largely product
of Morocco so right what makes me feel
better that they're not just sending you
like right random stuff it's it's
genuinely continually from so the next
thing in here is Mustafa's Mediterranean
preserved
Velde lemons and it looks like it
literally looks like lemon preserves
I've never even you can see chunks of
lemon in there look can you really ya
know like turn it I just always yeah
yeah yeah you're right you look like
yeah I can see a lemon in there what
does it say about it
well I can tell you on here it says for
hundreds of years the preferred lemon
used for preserving
in Morocco has been the belle D lemon
Orlean Mustafa's preserved lemons are
made with these savory lemons and will
add a wonderful flavor to any dish this
says yeah Moroccan cuisine is centered
around natural and aromatic foods like
these sweet preservative le lemons
similar to other organic marinades the
lemons used in this conflict can be
traced back to a specific numbered lemon
tree in Morocco mawa and a bit of this
tangy touch to any meat or pair with
dessert for strongly satisfying dishes
there you go so we're gonna add it to
meet your use that all right so next we
have a gourmet Moroccan harissa mm-hmm
that's pretty cool we got its rich chili
pepper garlic olive oil salt and cumin
so what do you use it on I don't know
but I remember what there was recipe
father it was harissa something used to
liven up quinoa and couscous emboldened
dishes with its tangy heat a traditional
stew or tasty tables like condiments oh
I bet we can use it on like a any sort
of rice rice any sort of or quinoa even
maybe my aura cool and I was reading as
he was reading another I was reading
more about the spices from the beginning
and it mentioned putting it on couscous
as well all right what else we got see
this so this one is kofte rub Moroccan
Robins spice blend yes and it is the
spice rubs and spices what does this say
kept Arab village arada I'm right now
I'm learning French you guys should know
that since we're going to Paris for
honeymoon we're both learning French
he's already like know in French I am
learning French but I know Spanish and
of course English so learning French is
hilarious because when I'm trying to say
the arse and in the French language
I keep confusing them with the arse of
the Spanish language Bridget which is
completely different and that are ours
in America which are just gross so in
Villa villa or via Jai Radha
or your father
okay anyway inspired by signing the Lula
aims to bring the aromatic genius of
Moroccan cuisine two plates and tables
beef lamb or chicken use this robust rub
on any meat to make the best kept ax or
Moroccan meatballs you've ever had
I feel like pepti was one that we put on
youngling but we didn't to make we
should kept it there we should yeah like
lamb look if I were to grill up I am
mm-hmm alright lastly good we can read
it it says it's all-natural sultan
all-natural are these sardines in a can
I think these are sitting to the came
out say Brenda Bell style if you've ever
seen it this is perfect and we play a
bit sardines are the worst and also
every time I've tried sardines I about
threw them up I don't know what it is
and I like fish it's not that I don't
like fish but something about sardines
and remember in a past try the world box
where I got sardines and I wish I could
member what country I don't you remember
but I was like no and some people were
like no actually they're pretty good but
supposed to be like yeah they're the
freaking worse I don't know what are you
guys put on sardines help me like them
because I'm pretty sure he likes them
and I'm trying but I just can't
timon so what I know about sardines is
that if these are in a can which this is
a box but I think there's a can inside
it self Annette just you might as well
willing but now here's the only thing I
know they I watched an episode of
Anthony Bourdain for those of you who
have not watched my Travel Channel I
love Anthony Bourdain he was talking
about how American cuisine when it's in
a can is really bad I forget where he
was think we somewhere in Africa or
somewhere in the Middle East I don't
remember what he was talking about how
American food in a can is basically
preservatives
terrible horrible stuff yeah but in a
lot of countries stuff this in a can
they actually will get all these
sardines and they will put them all in
individual cans with oils and really
nice spices and everything and actually
it's sort of a delicacy forget where he
was but it was like 50
Africa maybe if it was like 50 US
dollars per can of whatever using it was
a gourmet it wasn't just a yeah like a
can of soup that we have it's like you
know last minute dinner so I wonder if
that's what this is what does it say
about it though yeah it's an icon do you
want to read it this time here it is
Salton sardines and oil is what this
says this is there too so this beloved
Moroccan fish goes perfectly in
sandwiches or on the side of your
favorite monster recipes also paired
well with couscous sardines are an
essential staple in the Moroccan cuisine
in fact Morocco is the largest exporter
of canned sardines in the world that's
pretty cool so we need to look up I bet
like you know well yeah I feel like
these will probably do a good job
because it's sort of a gourmet kind of
thing I know we've literally thrown so
much at you I this video right now
before I edit is like 60 minutes on I
have no idea so I'm gonna try and edit
it down way more but if you were
interested please check out a channel
with this awesome and I will shamelessly
plug in for the rest of my life because
I'm gonna be with this dum-dum for the
rest of my life and I love him so anyway
