two different subscription boxes to open
for you guys I have a new try the world
box which is kind of like a food and
coffee and tea kind of box mixed into
one and I'll explain that in a second
and I also have a star look star box box
to open for you guys very different I
mean this is makeup and this is like
food and stuff but I do my boxycharm
versus Ipsy video separate and those
kind of go together and a lot of you
guys request those and that's kind of
its own thing so all the other boxes are
kind of left in the lurch so I usually
try and compile the other ones together
so I'm gonna start to try the world
because it's one of my favorites and I
honestly am dying to look in here and it
this is the first time it's come at the
cute ribbon cuz it's Christmas time it's
so cute isn't it it's one of those
things that it's just so classic
I just love ribbons on boxes that's
really the main thing what's that song
in Sound of Music
whiskers on kittens from Oh brown paper
packages tied up with strings these are
a few of my favorite things so it always
comes in this really sturdy mint box and
says try the world this would be a great
thing to get someone for Christmas if
you know they love food and the whole
idea behind this it is $45 a month so it
is expensive I mean there's no get
around that's expensive they send me
this for free to review and I'm thankful
for it because this is one of those
things that I don't know that I can
afford to buy this every single month
it's a lot but it really is amazing so
if you are a foodie or you know someone
that is a foodie they will love this and
it's the perfect gift for them they're
basically curated by country so this you
know I don't even know what country this
is yet so I'm excited I've gotten there
Paris box which is the first one you get
when you subscribe I've gotten there
Rome box which is amazing as well I like
that one even more I feel like I maybe
gotten one more I don't know I think
this might be my third one anyway so
let's see what country this oh okay they
always come at the culture guide oh okay
this isn't a country it's holiday it
says culture guide for holiday it has
this adorable picture on it oh I'm
excited I love things like this
so it usually will have like a little
note from the try the world team and
talks about the artisans from around the
world oh my gosh and it goes through
each product I don't even want to look
yet but when it's a country box that
goes through like popular music from
this country that you can listen to
while cooking and popular poetry and
it'll just have the poems I mean it's
just really just cool it really is cool
and when we're talking about gifts like
this is the coolest gift anyway so then
it's got a sheet that describes what's
in there and then I can't even see
inside this is about to make such a mess
oh my gosh here we go oh
so Christmas wonderful so I'm gonna get
some of this stuff out of here so you
can actually like see inside oh my gosh
I am so excited okay the first thing I'm
seeing is real big and it says Anna's
ginger Swedish thins and it looks like
just little cookies Sweden's most loved
pepper Kaka I'm sure I just butcher that
I'm so sorry if your Swedish sure you
speak Swedish these look delicious
though I love anything ginger and
anything cookie like or cracker like so
it says some things you just don't
change a lot has happened since Anna
Carlson baked her very first Swedish
thin her little backstreet bakery in
downtown Stockholm Sweden today her
Swedish thins or pepparkakor and Swedish
are known all over the world but the
recipe and a use back then hasn't
changed one bit it's still her wonderful
mixture of spices cinnamon ginger and
cloves mmm they're so carefully crafted
using the traditional baking trays
that's awesome since 1929
very excited about that I will
annihilate those I am sure the next
thing it says group o or Bonnie Tartuffe
e truffles oh it's like and this is like
a little bag oh it's got two little
truffles in it that is awesome I mean
you know I'm gonna annihilate these
maybe I'll give one to Tyler and all of
the other next thing these are all like
delicacy you're like a sweet thing so
that's kind of awesome this is mini mini
I want to say dulce de leche but it's
Doce de Leite a which I'm betting is
still the same idea but in a different
language says since desde 1983 so since
oh it's Brazilian okay this says it's a
milky spread a sweet milky Brazilian
spread three popular flavors try it on
toasts crepes ice cream or fruit be
creative so it looks like it's got like
a coconut a caramel I guess in chocolate
that's what I am guessing these are I am
excited about that I've never tried
little spreads like this so that can be
awesome with some black coffee or some
team this one's jam-packed yes it should
be for $45 okay the next thing is these
Rip Van waffles traditional Amsterdam
waffles there's two of them one is coca
filled and one is traditional okay
so it looks at home it says place your
Rip Van waffle on the rim of your coffee
or tea when it's too hot to drink wait
for the steam to warm the filling keep
waiting your Rip Van waffle is capturing
the aroma just a little longer trust us
it's worth it
when the Rip Van waffles softens with
melty goodness it's time to remove and
enjoy and they have like a picture on
there of what you should do that is so
cool
I am really excited to try that one of
them had the cocoa dust all over it so
now I'm a mess
okay the next things I'm seeing
chocolate powdered chocolate basically
it's so hot chocolate so excited about
that I mean hot chocolate is the bomb
I'm excited where is this one from
though so the Rip Van waffles by the way
were from Holland cuz they're Dutch
those were from Brazil the truffles were
from Italy by the way I don't think I
mentioned that the hot chocolate is from
it does not say it looks like it's in
French so I'm betting this is great I'm
really excited for that Oh
the next thing shook a lot Olay
that would be French right since yes
1826 or maybe it's Swiss yeah product or
Switzerland I'm sorry it's Swiss oh my
gosh that is gonna be amazing
it says its farver Jer I don't know how
to pronounce these things using
luxurious cocoa and pure Swiss milk
they've been concocting concocting this
authentic creamy indulgence its 1826 I
am very very excited about that
awesome so then there's these little
like I don't know if they're candies or
truffles or what let me see what it says
these are Oh mystery treat it
it it says because we believe every
holiday gifts should contain an element
of surprise we include a mystery
seasonal product from another country so
it doesn't say where but oh the last
thing is tea awesome it says this is
Nepal a the Tay no way I said that right
I'm so sorry you guys I'm terrible at
this
um combines the allure of the Orient
with the panache of French tea culture
awesome I'm really excited you know I'm
gonna drink it singing of the tea I'm
drinking right now in my adorable
holiday mug that I got at Big Lots last
year with Mickey all over at little
ornaments the tea I'm drinking now is
their yogi the yogi detox tea I've tried
the peach detox which I like but I think
I like that just plain detox a little
bit better because the flavor is not
quite as strong but it's just it's good
and you feel good after drinking it
whether or not it actually detoxify so I
don't know I keep hearing both ways so I
don't know but regardless I feel good
after drinking it and I think that's
important so that was everything in this
box that was amazing probably my
favorite I've ever gotten because it's
all holiday themed and it's all sweet
and I cannot wait to tear into all that
stuff so like I said that's $45 a month
I can put the link to their website
below it so next one is my star look
Starbucks which is $15 a month and these
always sometimes these are white
sometimes the black this one's cute cuz
it's got the glitter it's very holiday
like in my head Tommy I am still covered
in cocoa by the way alright so let's see
what's in it so November star box it
says mineral inspired and they got this
beautiful lady
awesome so yes it does go through what
it has and it says spoiler alert the
December star box contains a 15th shade
Pro eyeshadow palette a $99 value this
is your chance to treat a friend or
loved one with the gift that keeps on
giving
mailman's here yeah so cool ok lat I
remember I want to say it was the when I
first started getting these last year I
got there either in December January I
would bet December it was a 15 pan
eyeshadow palette
I'll show it to you I still have it this
was the eyeshadow palette they gave me
last December and it is called their New
Year's Eve palette 2014 and I like it I
don't use all of the colors but I
thought it was a nice grouping of colors
and you know I guess I can swatch some
of these I know some people have had
kind of mixed reactions to this but I
think it's I think they're pretty nice
shadows again I don't use all of them so
I don't I don't know I usually stick to
the light ones and I thought they were
fine and they were blendable but you
know and for $15 a month this I mean
that's pretty Sochi I don't know why
they would charge a $99 for this I think
that's ridiculous but for $15 I think
it's a really good palette so I'm
excited to see what colors will be in
next month's palette now I'm covered in
gunk okay so let's get into this month's
that was last year okay ooh okay first
thing a star looks is this an infinity
lip pencil and it's in the shade Teri's
choice and it looks like it's just this
burgundy lip liner don't really know how
else to describe that oh my gosh that is
absolutely gorgeous like a very berry oh
my gosh and it's like crazy creamy you
guys see that I can't wait to wear this
I can't wait to wear this I don't have
any lip liner that color that is so
gorgeous in so creamy you could just
wear this straight up as your lip like
you don't need any lipstick with it
looks like I'm wondering how it will
stay and stuff but gosh that is nice I
am really excited about that
okay next thing is a glitter comes in
their little box I know I just don't use
glitter I'll pass this on I guess you
could use it for your nails but even
that I'm not gonna do that it's in the
shade quartz and it's this really pretty
goldish purple color I mean it's a
really pretty color and I might try it
maybe on New Year's it matched my
glittery purple shirt that I'm gonna
wear that I showed in my haul a couple
videos ago so maybe I will you just have
to be so careful with it that it makes
me cuckoo but you have to be so careful
or else you can have glitter
everywhere so I don't know we'll see the
other thing that is so it looks like
they've got some little like jewels in
here don't know that I will be using
those but you know cute and then oh
they're packaging got an update that's
new it didn't use to have this cute gold
trim not that that matters but it's cute
so it's their star looks infinity
eyeliner I've been using their gel liner
in black for like ever since I got it
that's like all I use I love it so much
I use it everyday okay so this is a
silver eyeliner mm-hmm maybe I mean I
feel like you could probably also use it
as like a cream shadow you know what I
mean probably use it I'd be more likely
to use it that way than anything I mean
it's pigmented and nice I don't I don't
know again I mean I feel like from them
I always I feel like every star looks is
filled with gel liners like almost every
single one and they're always in gold or
silver I'm like I'm not gonna use those
I don't know it is pretty though maybe I
will at the holidays we'll see but but
gosh that lip liner alone is awesome
honestly I would pay $15 for that lip
liner alone to be completely candid but
the other two items and not quite my
style but that one by the way that is
sent to me for free as well from them
they've been sending me that for about a
year now and there have been some hits
and misses each month I mean that's kind
of the way it goes that's the way it is
for me for it see with boxycharm there's
always hit hit months and miss months
and this one was kind of both because
while I didn't love the other two things
this lip liner is unbelievable
I am so flippin excited to use that so
that is good
