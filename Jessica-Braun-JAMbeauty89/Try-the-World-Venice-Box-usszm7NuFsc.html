boxes to unbox and over the past year
that I've been getting them from this
company you know I liked him and I first
got him but each time I get one I get
more excited because I don't know as I
move closer to being married and living
with Tyler and all that stuff we really
like cooking together so I'm just really
excited to use a lot of the stuff I'm
kind of saving some of it for our future
kitchen like to use once we're together
and living together so I'm just excited
to see what's in this and yeah so I
talked to the lady from the company that
I'm like in contact with and their price
went down it used to be like over $40
and now it's there are a few different
prices basically if you buy like a year
subscription it's $33 per box and it's
like six times a year every two months
or I have it there another one if you
just bought it for six months which is
three different boxes it is $35 two box
and then $39 box if you want to do it
per month so you know you can save money
but it's that would be a lot of money up
front but then you gave me a promo code
for you guys for 30% off and the promo
code is just Jam beauty 89 my name here
on YouTube but I'll write that down
below
she also there's another offer you can't
use both but you can use one of the
other so that's the 30% off the other
one I think she said is basically if you
buy your first Venice box which this is
the box from Venice you get a free Paris
box just completely for free so that's
you know like a $40 value give or take
so I know that was pretty cool they're
both pretty good deals either way so it
always comes like this and the idea
behind this is that it's kind of like
traveling the world through food through
culinary products so that's what it
always is it's always food things and
each time you get one each box is a
different country or city this is Venice
and the boxes are just so cute these
would be great and actually I'm now
thinking I might save these for like
organizing my collection because they're
really sturdy and good for that so it
always comes with a culture guide which
is like
booklet that goes through all kinds of
cute different things like different
recipes you can make and some of my
favorites are at the end they talked
about some of the history like Carnivale
it talks about venetian songs like a
list of songs you could look up venetian
movies that are either like things are
set in venice etc so it's just so cute
you can learn about those little things
and then it also has a paper that
explains everything that's in the box
and like how you use it or what it is
because sometimes it's kind of confusing
it's the one this so I am very excited
let's go ahead and dig in the first
thing the most giant thing in here is
this I'm assuming that's coffee
Mogi brand emoji I blend of highest
quality hundred percent Arabica coffee
of five different origins for the finest
and authentic Italian espresso
yeah it's ground espresso coffee awesome
Tyler will love this but I will I get to
it in the packaging cute too and that's
that's awesome
so I'm excited about that the next thing
I'm seeing is red pesto and truffles now
every time I think of truffles that I
know I'm not the only one I always think
of like the candy like chocolate
truffles but it wasn't until recently
that I discovered that it's like it's
not a candy at all it's like what like a
mushroom or something like that yeah
truffle is an intensely flavored
mushroom that's forged in Italy from
December to March found in 1850 is
family company the Urbani name has
become synonymous with high-quality
truffle products today and throughout
the world so this is a rich fusion of
pesto and truffles that could be a part
of pasta fish and meat recipes so very
intrigued by this definitely going to
use it to cook something with Tyler once
we live together
I'm just so intrigued and I love pesto
so I'm excited to give them a try just
different something different you know
the next thing is this mulata de Bosco o
forest honeydew so does it like honey
then let's see if this one is on
it's not and it does say that there's a
mystery treat so this must be the
mystery one so it looks like it's kind
of like a honey it's really thick like
honey as well so that's pretty cool
that might be good on like toast or
English muffins I love honey on those Oh
where it melts into the butter oh my
gosh it is so good
all right the next thing this Lyon a
lemon candies I'm in candy originals
let's see what this says about it
wait was that it okay it's been this
company's been producing past steal
candy originals using traditional bronze
molds and high-quality ingredients in
torino in Northeast Italy since 1857
cool
I will eat those this might be good to
keep in like my desk at school where I
teach just to like just when I want
something sweet but I don't want to eat
like a whole thing of candy I don't know
that's pretty cool and I like lemon
flavored things I really I love lemon
heads going growing up alright the next
thing these I think are the same thing
they look like nougat let me see I'm
pretty sure yeah vent vencie tauren
cheney nougat the vengi factory still
preserves the same recipe perfected by
the artisan chocolatier Sylvia no Vinci
in 1870 and uses cocoa beans grown in
the Amazon through collaboration with
local farmers that sounds awesome so
they're just these you know little
nougaty goodies don't get one for me and
one for Tyler I guess I'll share good
alright the next thing oh this looks
like it kind of got broken if there was
a lot of big things in the next thing in
here as big as well so I think that's
why I was just big this is
para gira para ghena let's me see ya
pear pear Agena limoncello chocolate tab
the pear Gina confectionary was founded
in 1907 at central Italy you may know
them from their world-famous hazelnut
filled bocce chocolates which translates
to kisses is that bocce then be a CI or
bocce I don't know oh the chocolate are
they're wrapped in love notes that's
cute that makes me think of
like the Dove chocolate that have like
cute quotes on the outside authentic
rich chocolate rich chocolate with the
citrus taste that's awesome one of my
favorite things is the those little they
come around our around Christmastime
here in America those like chocolate
oranges like the dark chocolate oranges
I love those so much I wish they were
out year round we had to like smack I'm
against something hard and it breaks and
you can like peel it like an orange so
cute and they're so delicious so I
really like citrus infused chocolate
especially dark chocolate so I am really
excited to tie that I might fight over
this one because I know he loves that
too so awesome really excited about that
the last thing in here is a little bit
of pasta
it says ago we said the grunion oh it's
pasta feet gol de campy I'm sure I'm
butchering this you guys this handmade
pasta captures the essence of Italian
culture it takes his name from an
ancient village outside of Naples famous
for producing some of the best dried
pastas in Italy traditionally they would
hang their spaghetti to dry like laundry
in the fresh air today they're driving
with heaters but the traditional
approach remains cook it briefly out
then take to taste the difference so
very excited we'll definitely use this
I'm wondering if it would be good to mix
these two together and then have coffee
and the chocolate and nougat for dessert
I don't know I'm just thinking this is
so cool and what I love about this is
just that like I said you're trying
different things and you're you know
like in past box there have been things
that I've either never even heard of or
they're just like what like I've never
thought to try it in this way or these
two ingredients together and so I'm just
really excited and I just love this box
there's a ton of food subscription boxes
out there but you guys knowing me and
how much I travel in hell Tyler my
fiance has a Travel Channel like this is
I mean obviously this is something we're
crazy interested in and we love so for
us this just makes sense and I am glad
they lower the price because it was so I
mean it's still kind of pricey but it
was so pricey before so they must have
heard
our cries so that is awesome so
hopefully that was helpful if you're
interested in more different kinds of
subscription box reviews and unboxings
definitely subscribe and check out my
channel I've got a ton I've got a whole
playlist of subscription boxes so other
than that I'll catch you guys in my next
one bye next one is a liquid eyeliner in
jet is the color it's from Coastal
Scents so and on the side there's a
sticker and it's not even a sticker it
says 25% off for hip C back subscribers
or really for anyone if you have the
code the code is liner 25 off at
checkout I don't know if it's only good
for this or what or for their liners
let's see I use liquid liner everyday I
kind of do a triple layer I do like
pencil liner I know it sounds ridiculous
pencil liner then gel liner and then
liquid line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
