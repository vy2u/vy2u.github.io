get ready with you we will get ready
together if you like okay but today I'm
just gonna use a bunch of new drugstore
makeup so there's like a ton sitting in
front of me and I was going through my
drawers and pulling some things out so I
would say half of this I've already
tried I already have some feelings about
them and then half I just pulled out of
my like new makeup drawer and I'm just
gonna play today so I will try to do a
haul I guess this isn't a haul but I'll
try to do an update on this video maybe
a month or two from now after I've
gotten to try these a lot longer that
way I can give you my full thoughts so
this is not a review on these products
this really is more of a first
impression / kind of my initial feeling
so um I grab some coffee or tea or water
or whatever you'd like to drink and
let's get ready together are these pink
ears too bright do they make me look
paler than I already am all right so I'm
torn because there's quite a few new
drugstore products I want to put on my
face first so the ones I'm torn between
I've got the Physicians Formula 24 karat
gold collagen serum and then I've also
got the wet-and-wild photo focus primer
water spray and then I've already I've
already tried all three of these this is
the Pacific super flower rapid-response
face oil now I'm really big into face
oils right now Pacifica's drugstore but
it's kind of inching towards price-wise
a little bit more high-end honestly so
disposition formula I feel like a lot of
times their products are like $15 I'm
like that's pushing it but anyway so I
think I'm going to try the 24 karat
because I know I've had multiple people
ask about this and if it's similar to
the if it's similar to the girl on lore
or whatever primer so we can kind of
compare these if in need like so this
serum definitely has little gold bits in
it but I don't think it's like a real no
it's definitely not real gold there's no
way if it is okay but I doubt it
the gold you don't see on your face it's
nothing
like that but it's a very thin clear
serum it just kind of goes on and sinks
into your skin usually serums are
chalked full a really chock-full of
really good ingredients this says a 24
karat gold maybe it really is real gold
I don't know a 24 karat gold complexion
enhancing and plumping collagen serum
elasticity restoring serum with collagen
and skin rejuvenating 24 karat gold okay
delivers farmer plumper and more
youthful looking skin so it's got
collagen gold glycerin natural
protecting and lifting polymers and
brightening vitamin b3 so it's got some
ingredients that are gonna do some nice
things for your skin similar claims to
this gear lawn primer you can tell I've
not used a ton of it I need to use it
more I've kept it because I don't not
like it but I haven't really found what
the hype is behind it so I'm gonna
continue using this and let you know but
just so you are aware consistency why
they're virtually the same thing I mean
they are very very thin I think that
girl on one might be a little thinner
almost watery and it definitely has a
stronger smell than the physician's
formula so if you are sensitive to smell
I would go with the cheaper one for sure
but again if you've been eyeing this
mostly because you just curious about
this kind of a primer I would go for
this one
for now see if you even like this sort
of a primer and then if you're like okay
I want to splurge then go for it but in
the meantime just so you're aware so it
definitely sunk in really quickly it
feels a little bit tacky which I don't
mind before I put on like face products
I wanted to really quickly before we get
too far use this wet and wild perfect
pout lip scrub it's they have a
watermelon one it says it's limited
edition I'm hoping they make it
permanent it's got that it's a like neon
color I don't know that it needs to be
that neon but it smells it's a scrub I'm
getting it everywhere it feels so good
it smells like lip smackers watermelon
like chapstick it's amazing it just
makes me think of my childhood so I
figured I'd go ahead and scrub my lips
and then I usually just use a clean
washcloth to just kind
wipe it away I like to do this earlier
on because once you've got foundation
all around it then you're kind of wiping
away makeup so that's so fun this is
such a fun summery product if you can
find it wet and wild I've got a few wet
wild things from their limited edition
collection I might try today and I feel
like a lot of these they can be hard to
find but if you find it or you know a
store where it is let us know below all
right so I'm actually going to be using
some covergirl product but I'm doing a
separate video on them but I will tell
you and then you'll see me with it on
here in a second so you'll see what it
looks like but if you want to see me
applying it if that video is up I will
link it below but just so you're aware
I'm using the covergirl it's their new
true blend primer in the illuminating
kind and then I'm gonna put on the pore
minimizing kind on my nose and like
right there so those will be on my face
as primers other than that serum primer
I just put on and then I'm gonna be
putting on the covergirl trublend
matte foundation they have a ton of
shades watch that video if you're
curious because it's a lot more
inclusive than like most other drugstore
ranges have ever been for foundation and
I think that's really cool and that's
why I wanted to do a totally dedicated
video too so back to our get ready with
me here I've got the foundation on and I
really do I'm very impressed with this
covergirl foundation I'll link it below
as well as the primers but it's matte
but if you put their illuminating primer
under it or any kind of illuminating
primer I feel like it does a nice job of
making it look a little more lively and
it's got nice coverage so today for
concealer this is not new to me but it
is drugstore the Catrice liquid
camouflage concealer really is good
there's a reason a lot of people are
touting how nice this is and then I'm
just using my favorite favorite I keep
forgetting to mention this I use it a
lot in videos
it's the L'Oreal concealer sponge oh my
gosh this thing is awesome
I've been using it a lot just truly just
for concealer and it's such a quick way
to get in there it's it's just perfect I
really I use it every single day I only
own one of them and I feel like I should
go out and buy another so the Catrice
camouflage concealer is very brightening
of course I've got a shade that I'm kind
of wondering if I should go
pretty bright I need to maybe get
another shade that's closer to my skin
tone because I know a lot of people
really like that bright look and I don't
hate it but I think I could find a more
natural shade for me this shade I have
is porcelain yeah that probably is too
but it definitely brightens those dark
circles holy moly so I really like this
concealer I feel like it stays on really
well throughout the day I was very
impressed and I'm always so skeptical
when I hear a lot of people were in your
mind is it really good it is really good
they are all right so my brows are done
I just used my hourglass arch brow
pencil it's the one I have open right
now it's not drugstore that's why I
didn't show it on camera but I do I love
that it's one of my favorites so for my
eyes today I wanted to try I'm so torn
because I have these wet-and-wild
limited edition little quads that are
really really pretty that I have been
playing with the past week but then I
have these that I haven't even opened
these elf chromatic eyeshadow palettes
and there's kind of a blueish toned one
with some neutrals in it as well and
then more of a classic I say classic
right now it's very classic everyone's
got these these kind of more warm tones
let's just open them and look at them
you can also monster and if I can't get
something open right I just rip it I get
like instantly impatient and I just
ripped the whole thing open so these are
they're really thick palettes
they've used this packaging before but
this one's in posh peacock and it's got
really pretty blues and greens and then
this one is in bird-of-paradise
same packaging but it's got those more
warm kind of berry tones and some orange
tones maybe I'll kind of mix the two so
the white want once by the way are
really really nice there this is my
favorite I'm just gonna show it to you
at least and who knows I might still use
some of this this is stop ruffling my
feathers and it's got one matte shade
here kind of a transition shade that's
really really there stuff is always
really pigmented then they have this
gorgeous kind of duo chrome shade there
and then they have a really pretty
Orange well kind of a burnt orange and
then for brow bone they have this really
frosty white color I use it on my lid
cuz I think it's way too frosty and
actually a little for me a little too
deep but it's a really
teller so this is my favorite out of all
of them and I've been using a lot but I
want to try these elf ones out so I'm
just kind of throwing on I always put on
my wet and wild this is nothing new
Brule single shadow to kind of set my
eye primer I just threw one on there
were no new ones to trice so that kind
of gets it all ready so I'm gonna go
ahead and go into the birds-of-paradise
one from ELF and I'm gonna use let's see
I haven't even just watch these so we're
gonna see how these are this kind of
transitioning orangie actually more
Brown shades just into the crease I
could go into labor any day now which is
crazy
I'm almost 39 weeks as I'm filming this
and I I was like maybe I'll put on
lashes say I'm like no because if you go
into labor and you got lashes on and
you've gotta like either go into labor
with lashes on which is awesome
I would like squeeze the ball or take
the time to take them off all that stuff
I'm like it's just not worth it I'm just
gonna not do lashes I mean I really
don't do lashes all that often anyway
but so I feel like this is blending
really really well and really easily
don't you guys think for like if you're
like me and you just like really quick
shadows this is it's kind of a perfect
shade for my skin tone for the crease
but it's just it's going on pretty
easily so they really don't have a lot
of shimmers they have like this kind of
whitish gold one in this kind of bronzy
one and they are nice and pigmented the
bronzy one's a little powdery but that's
fine I can get beyond that but not
enough that like I want a shimmery
shadow on my lid I almost always do so I
am gonna dip into my wet and wild one
and stop ruffling my feathers and I'm
gonna put on that brow bone shade that I
really don't use on my brow bone and I
just like to apply it with my finger
isn't that pretty I feel like this is
such a pretty almost white but it's got
a little bit of a almost slightly rosy
tone to it or maybe
even like a cooler tone maybe that's it
either way I really really like this
shade a lot so I'm putting that mostly
on the inner part of my lid and then
kind of spreading it out you could
totally amp this up with a brush and mac
fix+
but I just want a softer look as usual
so now I'm gonna go back into the elf
palette and I want to put out something
darker in the outer corner I might go
for let me take there kind of boom
they've got a dual sided brush with it
let's use the brush it's got this kind
of fluffy side that I'll use for my
outer corner I think I'm gonna go in
with the kind of darker purple here
okay don't love the brush it's not
terrible but I can't like get this shade
I'm trying to place the shade in that
outer crease and I can't get it to stay
I don't know can you guys see that
it's a weird maybe it's the shadow let
me try the other side with my brush that
I usually use see if I can get it to
stay a little better maybe it's the
shadow so I think it's the shadow I
think that one's just a little bit
patchy I think it can still look nice
like you just keep packing it on and
then you can blend it so you can still
get a nice look out of it but I think
that shadow in particular is just a
little bit like you need to just keep
packing it on it's a little bit patchy
mmm so I'm gonna throw a little bit of
that same deeper color patchy color on
my lower lash line just the outer
portion so I'm gonna swatch the rest of
these shades because I'm curious they
seem to swatch pretty well the matte
swatch beautifully I mean they do but
like the shade I was just saying is kind
of patchy swatch is really nicely but it
really I just think it wasn't great so
again the swatch only tells part of the
story but they've got this really pretty
violet color in there if you're into
that it is a little powdery again that's
not that big of a deal because you can
just tap your brush off if you're like
me just blow on it but it's a really
pretty pink issue eyelet so if you're
into that I think that was a really
pretty addition they added to this to
make it just a little bit different
because without it it's just a standard
warm palette but with it I think that's
really cool so all in all this POW it's
okay do I think you need to run out and
get it no but if you know these color up
your alley it's not bad I feel like the
look I got with it core side to pull in
a shimmer but I still feel like the look
is nice but honestly one that I really
was impressed with is the wet and wild
one so the other two I own that I didn't
wear today is a Stella Costa I still
acosta baby that's what it is so it's
got this really pretty again it's got a
great they've gotten really good at
using
some kind of a mat transition shade
which I appreciate but it's got this
gorgeous teal in it I mean are you
kidding me and this gorgeous purple you
see if I can gorgeous I mean if you need
a few pops for like five bucks this is a
great little palette to have I'm excited
I do want to use that teal this summer
and then the other one I have from the
line is flock party and this one has
this really pretty kind of red tone it's
so pretty
and then it's got some gorgeous shimmers
too so they're all really really nice
and of course what milds nice and
inexpensive so it's a great way to buy
some pops of color without spending
fifty dollars on a super colorful
palette that you might not use as much
if it's not your taste so I got
beautiful swatches all over my arm so
I'm gonna throw on my L'Oreal infallible
eyeliner this is one of my favorite
drugstore eyeliners ever it's a pencil
liner you sharpen it it's super creamy
super black they have different colors
too I just use the black all the time so
I'm just gonna kind of tight line with
that just a little bit my tight line I
mean this just turned into fully lining
it oh well I just feel like that darker
shade on the outside is just not as dark
as I wanted so I'm gonna go back in I'm
not darken it a little bit
so I'm trying the new essence super last
eyeliner in deep black I've not tried
this yet it says 18 hour so this one's
very very new to me a little nervous
it's got a felt tip but it's really
really long I'm scared and excited oh
okay oh okay I'm clearly not used to
using this kind of a liner this could be
a nightmare oh boy this is hard to
control this is really hard to control
and it's spreading so now I've got a
really thick line which that's fine
that's usually the look I go for anyway
I might let that dry before I try
anything else let's try the other side
I'm not even gonna read it it is so this
is not beginner-friendly I'm gonna say
that right now if you are a pro liquid
liner I would consider myself a pro at
liquid liner and I suck using this I
mean it's just one of those learning
curves like anything but it's too long
and so it's really it's a nice idea in
theory but unless you are a makeup
artist like way better than me way
better it's this is not easy to use
until you get used to it I'm sure so to
clean this up because I literally cannot
finish this with this it's a good
product but like I said there's going to
be a learning curve unless you used some
really long super wet liquid liners I'm
gonna go in with my normal NYX epic ink
liner it's much shorter easier to
control to finish this because I can't
clean it up and if I know I've got to
film a bunch today I'm like okay it
needs to actually look decent I think
we're okay so like I said it's super
black it's just not my cup of tea when
it comes to the style of applicator it
just is gonna take you getting used to
so will I use it again maybe but only
when I know I've got time to like fix it
if I need to or if I'm not leaving
because it really is gonna take me a
while to learn so for mascara I'm gonna
go ahead and brush through my lashes I'm
gonna
this is the first time I'll be opening
it the flower beauty lash Warrior
mascara I've heard some people really
like it I have it in the shade fiercest
black and I'm just so curious if it's
any good
I've never have I if I try to flower
beauty mascara I think I've tried one
and I didn't like it but I was quite a
while ago so who knows all right so the
wand ooh it's the kind of a one I don't
always like but sometimes I'm impressed
it's kind of twisted and it's one of
those kind of fake plasticy wands
let's just see certainly separates your
lashes so if you're into that it
definitely does that
it's blackening them of course so I will
say that because it's separating your
lashes it's really pulling them up so
it's curling them too
so far it hasn't added like the amount
of volume I typically like yet but I've
only put on essentially one coat but it
is like I said holding a curl well so
far only time will tell
alright so that's after two coats I
think it's nice
is it my favorite mascara I've ever
tried No again I'm gonna continue to use
it cuz it's brand new and sometimes
after a few weeks it dries out a little
more I think it's a little bit wetter
and because of that but not even because
really I just I guess for me it's not
adding as much volume as I typically
like now I've got a really thick liner
on so kind of helps with the look of it
which is really nice but I don't hate it
it's not a clumpy mascara at least in my
experience so far today but I'll keep
trying it and again I'll update you guys
in the end after trying this for a while
so now we're gonna move on to the face
so I have some blush I want to try these
are the wet and wild flights of fancy
that whole line their blushes and I want
to try this one soon don't flutter
yourself and these are really really
shimmery shiny kind of crazy blushes so
we'll see it's almost like a blush
topper it's so shiny they have the shade
dare to soar which is a lot deeper and
it's really really pretty I think it's a
little too deep for my skin tone but
it's gonna look gorgeous on some deeper
skin tones and then they also have the
shade hummingbird hype and it's more
peach toned right there so and let me
Reese watch this you can see that one
yeah so actually maybe I will go with
hummingbird height because I think this
really the one called don't flutter
yourself is really light and so I really
think it's gonna be a better blush
topper than blush on its own for my skin
tone so we're just gonna we're just
gonna barrel in when I use my favorite
blush brush this is from it cosmetics
it's they're like heavenly I'll see if I
can find it link it these are always
their blushes are always really really
pigmented but they stay on really well
throughout the day so I can't
I mean it's and actually this is looking
nicer on my skin and I thought it would
it's not quite as shimmery as I thought
it might be and I didn't put on a
bronzer today I don't have any new
bronzers to try so I'm just kind of
pushing this back into that area so
color me surprised because I haven't
used these yet I'd only swatch them and
this actually looks really nice so this
might be my shade you know what I mean
now the highlight I want to use is from
Catrice I have fallen in love with this
highlighter it's their Catrice
highlighting powder in champagne
campaign and they had two different
shades and this is the one I liked the
most it's a very Jessica color it's
almost like a boring highlight but I
love that it adds this a little bit of
glow but it doesn't look like a streak
of highlight and that is what I love for
everyday so and you can kind of be
heavy-handed with it and it doesn't
matter but it's definitely glowy I mean
it's definitely saw a highlighter but
it's not like it never looks like a
straight up line I feel like and I can
put a little bit up there reminds me the
essence concealer highlighter that
everyone loves that I love too but this
is maybe a little glowy or maybe not
maybe it's like dead on there very very
similar
and I just love it and I feel like every
time I born is people like oh you've got
that glow that pregnancy glow like they
thanks Carol
but really I'm like but it's probably
the highlighter anyway I am obsessed
with this and I I do not throw that term
around I know a lot of people say their
obsesses I think I really don't use that
much I have not put this down since I
opened it so I love it the other one I
just wanted to mention it's this Revlon
sunlit dream highlighter palette it's
nice but I feel like it looks a little
chalky on the skin it so really I can't
even say it's nice it's okay it looks a
little chalky and powdery on the skin
I've tried this for maybe two weeks and
I haven't used it in a while because
every time I see it I'm like I just
don't want to it can look okay
especially if you end up putting like
mac fix+ spray or some kind of setting
spray on it to help take down the kind
of powder enos but I just wasn't
impressed and again when you can find a
really nice highlighter at the drugstore
for cheaper like this Catrice one
there's no reason to buy this so I
wasn't super impressed with that one so
for my lips we're gonna put on two
products and this one is a weird one I
have really been liking it but I would
not be surprised if other people did not
and I can explain why this is the
essence ultra last lipstick I have in
the shade o 8 which is like the perfect
neutral shade for me this is a little
bit waxy and what do I mean by that is
you gotta kind of go to get it on
however it's a really comfortable
formula once it's on so I'm not gonna
lie my lips I'm just gonna go ahead and
put it on so you can see I feel like I
have to keep going back and forth but
once it's on it's actually a very
comfortable lipstick and I feel like
some of my favorite lipsticks while they
might glide on in one swipe they tend to
be a little bit more dry and not nearly
as moisturizing there's something about
this shade and this formula that I just
I love it feels like I'm wearing a lip
balm right now and to me this is
definitely at your lips but butter
better color for me and I
using it every single day because I feel
like it makes me look put together but I
hardly had to do any work there's no
lipliner it's comfortable it's so so
comfortable now I did want to put a
gloss on top just because I wanted to
show you this - it's from the wet and
wild that same line it's got really
pretty packaging it's called fly gal and
this is kind of a lighter pink it's just
a lip gloss it definitely has some color
to it they have a peach is it kind of a
peachy one like a lighter peach one
that's actually in my purse I do like to
I'm just gonna throw a little of this on
it doesn't mess with you know the color
too much of whatever you're putting it
on top of especially if it's just like a
pinkish color but these are comfortable
they're not super sticky they're just a
lip gloss I know you know with lip gloss
to truly reinvent the wheel with lip
gloss would be hard to do you know but
it's a comfortable lip gloss and I like
that it's not super sticky it's not
super thick it's just kind of there and
it kind of feels moisturizing in a way
so I've been wearing that one a lot too
I'm gonna throw a little bit on the
inner corner of my eye just because why
not
that's saying remember that color I used
on my lid I'm gonna throw a little live
out on my inner corner cuz I never do
that
so I figured I would go ahead and use
the wet and wild primer water spray if I
remember reading correctly it said you
could do it afterwards too it's kind of
a setting spray slash primer spray slash
whatever you really want it to be the
spray is actually pretty decent it does
a really fine mist almost too fine and
I'm like come on I can't get enough but
I like it it's I feel like with setting
sprays it's hard again it's hard to
reinvent the wheel there's only so many
different ingredients you can use and
but it does a nice job of kind of
refreshing the face I wish I don't know
like I feel like it's maybe it is
clogged a little bit because I still get
the dots it doesn't perfectly evenly do
it which is not that big of a deal it's
really not um especially if you're
someone that goes through setting sprays
and primer waters those kinds of things
really quickly I think this is a nice
one it's cheap you'll probably fly
through it like you already do but I
mean it's been working fine and I've
used it for
last week so this is the completed look
I feel like you know I love drug source
so much and that's like my home and even
as I've obviously had more opportunities
to try a lot more high-end brands and I
talk about high-end brands on my channel

drugstore and that's never gonna go away

try to keep a good balance
but regardless that I mean I feel like
okay if I were to look out on all the
products I use some of my favorites
