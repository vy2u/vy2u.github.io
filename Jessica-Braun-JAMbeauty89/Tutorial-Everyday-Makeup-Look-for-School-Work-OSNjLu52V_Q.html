a lot of you guys have asked me to do
more tutorials more get ready with me so
I figured I would do a tutorial for you
guys today and I thought well what
should I do I really haven't done very
many but I thought why not do my
everyday look I think I did an everyday
look in the past like as I get ready
with me video but it's changed and you
know I we all switch up our makeup
routine I would like to thing or at
least most people that probably watch
these kinds of videos do so - would SH
up a little bit but it's a really
natural and kind of simple look but
there's still a little bit of shimmer to
it you can see so if you're interested
in learning how I created this look stay
tuned
hey everybody okay so first things first
I'm going to start with my polished
choice tinted moisturizer and this one
has an SPF of 30 which is great so it's
protecting me but it also has a little
bit of coverage since it's tinted and
I'm also of course going to use my EOS
sweet mint lip balm my favourite to
moisturize my lips while I'm doing my
makeup mmm
okay so then for foundation I'm using my
Revlon Colorstay whipped one of my
favorites and I'm just gonna dot that
all over my face and extra kind of in
spots where I feel like I need a little
more coverage and then I'm just using a
Deva Beauty kind of thicker buffing
brush Sigma makes a good one too just to
blend I poked myself in the eye but I'm
blending from the middle out and working
it back into the hairline so I don't
have like a mask like effect Lulu okay
so then I'm going to do my brows I'm
using the Anastasia brow Wiz and medium
brown and I'm just going to comb through
it with this bully and then starting on
kind of the bottom of the brow doing a
darker line and then working my way up
and doing the same of course on the
other side and then I'm just going to
brush through them with that really
thick dense spoolie and I love it
because it's small so you can really get
in there but it evenly distributes the
color I'm going to use the essence lash
and brow gel not one of my favorites but
it kind of gets the job done but it
doesn't hold as well as the Anastacio
version does for concealer I'm using my
Maybelline Dream Lumi in the brightener
shade and I'm just going to kind of make
kind of a smaller V thing since this is
an everyday look I don't go too crazy
with the concealer but I'm just going to
use my fingers to blend it in because
this formula really melts right into the
skin ah okay so that I'm using my Rimmel
stay matte powder
just to kind of set the under our area
just a little bit and then I'm using the
Tarte Park Avenue princess bronzer in my
giant Sedona lace fan brush that I love
and I'm just going to kind of lightly
bronze the face not really a strong
contour but I am going to put it in kind
of the lower part of my cheekbones and a
little bit on my the tops of my forehead
a little bit you know anywhere the Sun
would naturally kind of hit is where I'm
going to hit it or where I want to
create a little bit of shadow then I'm
using my Maybelline highlight master
highlight blush and it's in the rose
shade and just going to put it on the
apples of my cheeks just using an altair
Beauty brush and then I'm going back
with my foundation brush because it was
a little too strong I think and just
kind of blending it in so it doesn't
look as harsh since this is kind of an
everyday look you don't want it to look
too Greg Greg
going back with my Rimmel stay matte and
a Sonia Kashuk powder brush just going
to lightly dust over the oily parts of
my face mostly my t-zone then I'm using
a benefit cream shadow in RSVP just a
small one I have and I'm just going to
put this all over the lid using my
middle finger so there's not too much
pressure and it blends out pretty easily
and I don't want it to be completely
blended out I'm using the NYX single
shadow and SOS one of my favorite great
own ones and I'm just going to blend
this kind of really easily into the
crease I'm just using a fluffier
eyeshadow brush from diva beauty but any
brush would work that's kind of fluffy
and just kind of working it in there's
no real wall wrong way to do it and then
I'm going to use a tinier brush or a
smaller brush and using the same shadow
just darkening up that outer corner and
outer crease area and a little bit on
the outer part of the lid then I'm using
my Maybelline Color tattoo pigment and
barely brazen which is a nice shimmery
champagne color and I'm just going to
put that on the inner part of my lid you
could put it all over the lid but I
already have kind of pronounced lid so I
don't want to you know showcase it too
much and then I'm just using a clean
brush a very fluffy brush from Sigma to
just blend it all together then I'm in a
tight line with basically any black
liner this is an urban decay one I'm
almost I've almost used up but I'm just
tightlining filling in the waterline
area and in between the lashes and all
of that just to darken it and then after
this I'm going to use my cream liner
from
starlooks that I adore as well I also
like the Maybelline
meloria ones and I'm just using an
angled brush to thicken that line and
this kind of really sets it if I only
had one kind of liner it would be cream
cream or gel liner I love them but I'm
gonna just thicken the line darken it
key I'm going to have it thicker on the
outer part of my eye just based on my
eye shape and I'm also creating a little
bit of a wing which I'm going to perfect
a little more with this liquid liner
from Rimmel which is one of the
scandalized ones again not one of my
favorites but I'm just using it right
now trying it out so but yes so I'm
again going over the line and mostly
working on that little wing it's not a
big wing and I'm going to fix it with my
eye makeup remover from ELF that I swear
by it's three dollars and you can really
do a lot with these but especially for
cleaning up wing tips in mind of course
it's just a small one then I'm using my
starlooks
exit to Eden liner just on my outer
lower lash line I'm not going all the
way around again with my eye shape it
just I don't like the way it looks on me
so I'm just doing the outer part I'm
going to comb through my lashes with a
lash comb that I have I really like the
metal kind and then I'm going to curl
them with my Tarte lash curler and then
the mascara I'm using is a mary kay one
it's their ultimate mascara and it's not
my favorite it's okay but it's not
nearly as volumizing as many that I've
used but it doesn't clump which is also
nice but again not my favorite I ended
up having to go over it about three or
four times just to get even close to the
look I wanted and even then it wasn't as
good as it could have been I think so
not my favorite but it's not terrible
and then I'm going to line my lips with
the nude pink shade from the NYX lip
liner and it's just kind of it almost
matches my lips perfectly but it just
kind of cleans up the look a little bit
I think and of course this is a step I
would skip if I was in a rush but then
the lipstick is Mac's angel which is
another favorite just neutral pink color
just going to throw that all over it got
a little over teeth there and that
pretty much completes the look whew
hopefully that was helpful for you guys
to watch I know that I've gotten plenty
of requests to do tutorials and more
videos like this so I'll definitely be
working on that if you have any specific
question to do please let me know down
below
I'm going to try and switch these up so
it's not just voiceover type like this
one was all the time I'm going to do
some with music I'm gonna do some where
it's kind of more like a talk through
like we're just girlfriends getting
ready together so um just know that I'll
be switching that up a lot so if you
didn't like this style of video I'll
have other kinds coming up soon and I'll
catch you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
