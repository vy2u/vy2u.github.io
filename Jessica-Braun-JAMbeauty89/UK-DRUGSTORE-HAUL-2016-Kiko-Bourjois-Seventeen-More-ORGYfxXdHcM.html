bringing you a call from London so that
means I went to Boots there and I bought
some makeup from Kiko and bushwa
bourgeois yours always make fun of the
way I say that and I always try soap &amp;amp;
Glory and 17 what else
Jessica oh and Max Factor I think that's
it oh and Bioderma so let's go ahead an
get into it I actually ironically when I
came or no I should say coincidentally
when I came home from London there was a
package there from sleep and I had
planned to buy some things from sleep
but I didn't and luckily I didn't
because they sent me some amazing things
so I'm gonna be doing a separate sleek
haul soon of those things they sent some
of their new products that are like
blowing my mind so I'm excited about
that but let's focus on the things I
bought first thing Bioderma i bought it
first when I was in Paris last year and
I bought a small one to try it out and
eleven so I bought a bigger one this
time and just put it in my checked
baggage all like wrapped up like you
think this was like like my prized
possession like it was like expensive
something that's gonna break no I just I
just wanted to make sure this guy at
home anyway um I really do like it I do
want to try and compare it to like the
simple micellar water and what's the
other one does Garnier now I have one
out there's a lot out there so I would
like to compare them in the future so if
you have any more micellar waters that
you really like let me know down below
but oh and if you don't know what that
is which this confused me for a while
all you do it's like a makeup removing
liquids so you put it on a cotton round
and then I just wipe my eye makeup off
with it you can do it on your entire
face as well sometimes I do now that I
have a bigger bottle maybe I will
usually I just get my makeup off with
another
sir let's start with Akiko stuff because
that wasn't stuff I was so sad when I
left Paris that I didn't find a Keiko
store there and so I was like okay found
one I was in common garden and I saw the
Keiko store there and I was like Tyler
saddle up we're going and I actually he
was he was like I'm proud of you you
didn't take as long as I thought you
would of like well okay whatever you say
I could have been in there for a million
years so I'm kind of separating my
things here the first things I bought
from Kiko were some lip products from
them I'm so excited about these so first
I bought some lip liners because I
wanted to try well these are two colors
I don't really have like I don't really
have a light peach one and I don't
really have just kind of a medium pink
one so this is their creamy color
comfort lip liner in the shade 302 and
it's just truly just a peach lip liner
what I noticed and the reason I bought
them is because i swatched a bunch of
these and then I walked away and I was
looking at the eyeshadows and stuff and
then when I went to wipe it off I
couldn't get it off and I was like oh
I'm gonna need that so I bought two of
them and this next one is the same line
that it's in the shade 3:12 it's a true
pink they're coming across like opposite
yeah this one's the pink anyway so
really excited to give these true go
moving on more lip products I got two
from this line first of all why is this
packaging so cute Kiko is so reasonable
when it comes to the price but their
packaging is gorgeous
so these lip products the name is not on
them what kind it is so I will find that
listed right here but they're both from
the same line this one is in the shade
612 and you kind of push that and it
pops out so cute
and even the bullet feels like a little
more expensive I just can't believe that
so six twelve this one yes this is what
I was very excited about these are kind
of matte just thought it was so pretty
kind of peachy but like a deep peach I
really like that and then the other one
from this line was in the shade 613 and
it's more pink
so put that next to us you can see it
this one wasn't as pigmented right off
the bat as the first one i swatched I
had to double
go back and forth it's still really
pretty though and again these are like a
comfortable map where they're definitely
Matt right off the bat but they're not
super drying so I'm excited to try these
some more this other Kiko lipstick
actually says what it is it's their
glossy dream sheer lipstick and it's in
the shade 204 and this is another one
where you push the button on the top and
it pops out so this one is a little bit
glossy ER which I don't love but I'm
trying to get back into gloss because it
makes my lips look better anyway and
it's kind of that more it's fair
actually I didn't realize it's very
similar to that first one
turn it how could I not catch that but
it's just like a more glossy version
very very comfortable I wore this one a
couple times after I bought it there so
I kind of wish I would have gotten one
more of these but oh well next time
alright so Kiko I also got a blush from
there in the shade 109 it's their soft
touch blush in 109 and it's just a
classic light pink it's so pretty I've
worn it it stays all day it's pretty
darn pigmented and it's just a really
light pink I don't think this would look
right if you have really deep skin tone
you might want a different shade but I
was really impressed with the formula of
the blush and I really liked the shade
too I also got in this one I'm still
trying to figure out how I want to use
this is there soft light powder in the
shade 0-2 and it's a baked mineral face
powder well I bought a really light
shade because I wanted to like highlight
with it you know kind of like the
ambient lighting powders and with a name
like soft one is it soft like powder I
thought it'd be like that I'm so messing
with it it doesn't really do much it is
lighter so it kind of lightens the area
but I'm still medicine with it because
I've only used it a couple times and
every time I'm like it's not really
doing much so I'm gonna keep playing
with it though I almost wish I'd gotten
another blush instead of that one
because I do like that blush so much so
this I wish I would have bought every
color I regret not buying every color
this is their long lasting wet and dry
use eye shadow it doesn't say I don't
know if that
actually it's called but it's in the
shape 202 and I think these are really
popular these are they're like it's kind
of got a really cool design and they're
insanely shimmering insanely pigmented I
mean just gorgeous to wear there it is
there it's just so shimmery oh my gosh
it's like a dream and I have used it wet
and it's even more beautiful I mean it's
crazy I wish I would have gotten a
couple more of those again next time
no biggie Jess you'll be back again
hopefully one day all right the last
Keiko item I bought was just one of
their eyeshadows I couldn't find like
can you not buy in store like the little
system or you can snap these into I
don't know so I just ended up buying one
eyeshadow I kind of wish I either got
more got none but I actually really like
this color it's in the shade okay so
it's their infinity high pigmented
eyeshadow in the shade - oh for and it's
just a really normal kind of almost
Orange like camel colored I should say
very much a camel colored eye shadow
perfect for blending in between just
kind of as a buffer color which is
exactly what I wanted it for and it is
amazing for that so I am I had a lot
about that this time on this trip I was
smarter because I knew not to pack as
much makeup because I knew I would buy
makeup and bring that home so then I
don't know cuz last time I brought like
a couple blushes and then I also bought
a couple edges so I ended up with like
six blushes on my way home like this is
ridiculous so there's a little smarter
about the way I packed this time so from
Bourjois I haven't bought two different
things so I bought another one of their
healthy mix serum foundations because
the first time I bought it I bought it
in vanilla and it was a little too light
for me it didn't look right so this time
I bought it in the shade 53 beige and a
light beige which I thought oh this is
perfect i swatched it like in 10 million
places to see and it looks great in the
store I took it home and I don't know if
this oxidizes on me or what but it looks
horrible on me and I really mean
horrible I've used it like four times
and every time I've tried a Beauty
Blender a brush my fingers it just
doesn't look right so I'm gonna maybe
mess with a couple more times but I'm
like man I just can't catch a break
everyone loves this and I've tried two
different ones now
just don't look right on me so I don't
know I'm really sad I'm gonna keep
trying for the team I won't keep trying
but I also bought the Bourjois healthy
mix um well it's good see it there it is
correcting concealer there were so many
words there and it says it's got apricot
it's got raspberry and it's radiant and
anti-fatigue it's just a squeezy tube
one I got the color light right no I got
fifty one light radiance and it's truly
like really light but um I've been
trying to blend this in and I've worn it
the past week almost every single day
trying to make it work it's actually a
pretty good match for me but it just I
feel like again no matter how I apply it
it just doesn't quite blend in so I can
always see it like it's literally
probably just moving around do you know
what I mean I haven't really had that
experience with the concealer in a long
time so I'm like I don't know again I'll
keep trying it but so far I'm like look
deal the next thing I got two products
from Max Factor just because the
nostalgic Jessica needed to own
something from Max Factor because they
don't sell it here in the States anymore
unless it's like a discontinued product
at Big Lots so I was like I got out with
something for Max Factor I think of like
I Love Lucy and Lucille Ball and how he
was her makeup artist and all that stuff
and I just had to so the first thing I
got was this cream puff pass press can't
say a cream puff pressed powder and it I
just got translucent now what blew my
mind is that this shade is translucent I
was like what what but it has this
terribly strong smell that I kind of
love because it makes me think of like
stage makeup classes and like it also
makes me think of the makeup my mom used
to wear and I watch her and I would like
to smell her makeup did anyone else do
that so there's a very strong scent
memory for me with smells like this so I
don't mind it only because of that but
if you are sensitive to smell you would
hate this because it is a very strong
smell
but it comes with this like like puffs
but it's like I don't know how to
describe it I haven't tried to use it
yet but it doesn't
you'll it feels cheap but I can't tell
cuz parts of it don't look cheap so I
don't know but I've just left it on
there and it's kind of like the Rimmel
ones where it just sits on top of it
the next thing I got from Max Factor was
one of their lipsticks this is in the
shade Firefly and again it's kind of a
just comfortable kind of glossy lipstick
I just thought it was really pretty and
I loved the name Firefly it made me
think of like summer and like staying
out at night when it's like hot but it's
cooled down a little bit and it made me
think of princess in the frog and
Firefly so I had to buy it for the
dumbest reasons ever I had to buy it but
it's such a pretty kind of it's got kind
of a purple ship to it I also bought
from 17 this eye eye shadow in the shade
fun fair fun fact about fun fair I was
in the line there at Boots and Tyler was
trying to like hold some of the makeup I
was getting as well so he's helped me
out and I dropped this and it was a
different shade and it was the most
beautiful and I don't remember what it
was called now but it was the most
beautiful shadow ever and I dropped it
in it broke I'm like No so I went back
to see if they had another one and they
didn't but I said well I want to at
least try one so I got a different shade
this one's so beautiful - it wasn't as
pretty as the original so this is the
shade funfair and it's got like this
actually let me swatch it on my other
hand and put it it's got this really
cool like almost duochrome it's like
gold and pink and orange it's so pretty
it makes me think of a sunset but I
really really liked it I haven't I don't
think I've worn it yet
I might have worn it one day there but I
still want to try this out but it
certainly had a lot of pigment to it
whether it blends or not I'll have to
get back to you and the last thing I
bought there was from soap &amp;amp; Glory
and it's their kick butt concealer and
it the name made me laugh it comes with
a little puff and then there's a powder
like a white matte powder and then let
me take the puff off when you lift this
up how do I do this oh okay when you
close it lift it up there are two
different shades of like a cream
concealer so there's like a yellow one
and then
like apricot one and it even says let's
see step one and step two so step one is
under ice oh yeah they're saying this
apricot one would be under eye and this
yellow one would be face like spots on
your face they're they're really creamy
so there's no I mean and there's a lot
of pigment to it but I'm running out of
room I'll do it here but again I was
struggling to get these to blend I only
use this once though so I'm not gonna
judge this one yet I figured it's worth
mentioning but I'm gonna continue to try
it I haven't tried the powder on top
with it I'm assuming it's like a setting
kind of brightening powder I like the
idea that it all being in one you know
where you got everything you need to
conceal this is something that fire only
bring like three things with me this
would be something that would do a lot
for my face would be really cool this is
really nice
I'm so excited to try some of these out
