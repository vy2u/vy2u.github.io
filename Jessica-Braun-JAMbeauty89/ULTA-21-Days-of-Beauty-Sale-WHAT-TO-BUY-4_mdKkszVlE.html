doing a different kind of video so I'm
gonna share with you guys what my
recommendations are for you to buy
during the Ulta 21 days of beauty
now I haven't opened this catalogue yet
and so I have no idea I haven't looked
online so I thought I'd be fun for you
guys to see my reactions to what they
have on sale so I'm gonna share things
that I've tried that I love but I'm also
gonna share things that I've never tried
that I'm probably going to buy during
this sale so before I get started I want
to mention Ebates no it's not sponsored
by them I've done sponsored videos with
them but I want to mention it for five
seconds
eBay to get cash back the thing is like
when you shop online you literally just
click on eBay it's type in Ulta go to
Ulta and you're gonna get cash back for
whatever you're buying so it's like the
quickest easiest way to get like
sometimes if it's a smaller order you
might get a couple dollars if you're
spending $50 $100 you're getting way
more than that they it's the easiest
thing the reason I mention it is because
I've been using it for years I have a
referral link I'm always honest with you
guys if you don't want to use the
referral link I will also link just
regular ebates.com you can choose which
one you want to use but it's amazing I
totally recommend it let's get into it
it's always exciting like opening the
first page I'm like oh my gosh
okay so March 19th which is tomorrow
right yes March 19th which is the Sunday
the first day two-face love flush blush
in the philosophy micro delivery I've
tried the love flush flush blushes
they're $13 they're alright
I mean they're not bad by any means but
I feel like you can get drugstore ones
for you know a little bit cheaper and
they're about the same they're okay I've
never tried the philosophy exfoliating
wash March 20th the lorac perfection
powder is 1650 I've never tried that as
well but I've heard pretty good things
about lorac powder so that's what I'm
thinking about buying 21st is the bare
minerals all of their primers I've never
tried their primers but I feel like I
breakout from a lot of bare minerals
products so if you know if you have a
similar skin type to me I don't have
very sensitive skin I do have dry skin
but I feel like the laura geller baked
products break me out and bare minerals
products oftentimes not all of them
some of their products break me out so
if you're like me I don't know but those
are way cheaper I mean a lot of these
are obviously like 50% off next one
March 22nd is the buxom full-on lip
creams they're only 10 freakin dollars
I'm gonna buy at least one or two shades
I love white Russians like their cult
classic but the thing about their
full-on lip creams is they're really
pigmented but they're still glossy and
they give you this tingling sensation
and they smell like coffee cake and
vanilla and they're just so amazing and
I love like they have like frosted glass
packaging they're beautiful they feel
high-end I even own one in a while I
used to only own white Russian but it
got really old and I didn't use it up
because I've got a million lip glosses
but those are ones I'm definitely gonna
buy some from I totally recommend for
ten dollars I mean that's getting close
to drugstore prices
all right March 23rd the Stila smudge
tic waterproof eyeliners those are so
good they're very very creamy absolutely
like waterproof I'm gonna get one
they're $11 regularly 22 I'm probably
gonna buy one in black I've had the
other colors I've had the gold which is
absolutely gorgeous if you like gold
liner maybe on your lower lash line
wherever you like it
they really don't move and I love cela
liners I love the liquid eyeliner from
Sela there stay all day I just actually
literally today ordered online my like
eighth one of those I love it anyway I'm
probably gonna need the black one there
they have the Clarisonic Mia 2 for $129
only four dollars off I own like two of
the Clarisonic ones and I just don't use
it every night I just don't I like them
but I think they're expensive and you
can get cheaper versions March 24th it
cosmetics brow power Universal pencil
I've tried that before it's pretty good
the thing is it's universal because like
if you press harder it's dark review
press lighter it's okay like if you've
never tried brows it might be good for
you because you can get different
versions of it but I've owned a couple
and I never really reach from I was
never really that impressed with it and
I love it cosmetics I'm gonna kind of
skip through because this is gonna take
forever
March 25th is the Tarte lights camera
lashes that's
hey it's $10 if you're dying to try it I
know a lot of people love it I didn't
love it and I like really volumize
curled separated lashes and I didn't
really love it
continuing on one of my favorites
on March 26 is the Becca backlight
priming filter and it's only going to be
19 freakin dollars originally 38 I
bought that full price and I love that
primer it gives you this beautiful kind
of like glimmery I mean there's no make
no mistake that it's kind of glimmering
not glittery but just kind of nice and
glowy but you can put it all over and it
just if you put it under your foundation
it is so beautiful it makes you look
like you're lit from within I love it
100% recommend buying I wish I would
have waited to buy it now March 27th
they have it cosmetic brushes I love it
cosmetic brushes some of them are way
too dense and so I don't use them this
is their airbrush smoothing foundation
brush for 11 bucks their brushes are
really good so if you're needing one
like that March 28 I actually might buy
this this is the Tarte man-eater
eyeliner for only 10 bucks I've heard
it's really really creamy black which I
love so I might end up buying that March
29th laura geller baked blush and
brighten 14 bucks you can get those for
around that same price on HauteLook
because HauteLook always has 50% off of
products and so when the brand comes on
like they just had Cielo on there they
have a lot of stuff for like really
really cheap those break me out I won't
buy it but they're really nice my mom
loves those products she loves those
blushes because they are a beautiful
flush on the skin they blend well they
look natural but beautiful future Jessie
here I later learned that this it
cosmetics naturally pretty palette is
also part of the sale this day and this
palette is gorgeous it's really
pigmented it blends beautifully I ended
up too cluttering because I wasn't
reaching for it but if these shades
speak to you then I would totally
recommend it absolutely nice palette
next day March 30th the benefit they're
real tinted lash primer now I actually
own this currently it didn't really do
that much like it was an extra step in
my regimen for the tinted lash primer
that really didn't make my lashes any
better I feel like I've tried other
primers that were a little bit better
like the L'Oreal white primer I was
pretty impressed with but I just don't
use lash primers very often because it's
an extra step that I you know if the
mascara is really good it does what it
needs to do without the help of a primer
so I like that it's tinted because then
there's no white that shows through but
even for $12 I mean if you're not really
into that I don't think you need it or
if you have a mascara that you already
love it's not gonna really amp it up any
more than it already does next day March
31st is the Smashbox primer water I'm
probably gonna buy that I'm dying to try
that I own like all kinds of different
setting sprays and primers and stuff but
I really like Smashbox primers but I've
never tried their primer water so that's
kind of on my radar it's been on my wish
list for a while and for 16 dollars
instead of 32 I'm probably just gonna
bite the bullet and do it next day Mario
Badescu is 25% off I love their drying
lotion for like spot treatments you only
I mean it's a very strong treatment and
some people absolutely hate it I need to
get it again I bought mine on HauteLook
for half off as well but they're drying
lotion is great you dip it you don't
shake it up and it separates naturally
so you dip like a q-tip in it and you
put it on just like little pimples you
have it dries it overnight it is wild
very strong you don't want to use it all
the time but when you've got one of
those like under the skin pimples that
you're like oh my gosh it's gonna be
five days before it finally is a regular
pimple and it hurts that's when you want
the drying lotion that stuff is amazing
continuing on Urban Decay perversion
mascaras $11 on April 2nd and the
Shiseido Shiseido eyelash curler is only
10 that's just a toe eyelash curlers
been on my wish list too
I think I'm gonna finally buy it the
Urban Decay perversion mascara for 11
bucks I've never tried it I've heard
really good things so I might buy it if
I'm already buying the curler also
future Jessie here so I later learned
that the lorac unzipped gold and the
original are also 50% off if you're a
platinum member totally recommend
probably gonna buy anyway next I'm
skipping through April 4th the pure 4 in
1 pressed mineral
make up I did not like that it was very
splotchy on my face and I liked a lot of
pure cosmetics products I love their
eyeshadows I love their pure like little
there's the puppy beagle okay call God
just anyway uh so I don't recommend it I
can't put my stamp of approval I have I
have dry skin and I didn't notice that
it necessarily eliminated a dry skin
from what I remember but I they sent me
like four shades and I did not like it
I'm skipping through the on April
seventh they have the Tarte Amazonian
clay blush or highlighter for 14 freakin
dollars now here's my two cents on those
they're worth the money but like they're
not the kind of blush that you swatch
and you're like wow there's a kind of
blush that you apply and you're like
beautiful
they sent me like their entire
collection I actually have none in my
collection currently because I found
that there were no shades that I really
felt strongly about and so over time I
ended up getting rid of all of them I
kind of wish I kept one maybe to be able
to show you right now but they're really
good and they do say all day it's just I
just haven't found that one it shade for
me
holy moly April 8th the Anastasia brow
Wiz is 10:50 buy it I will be buying a
backup for myself of the medium brown
now for me I can absolutely use the brow
Wiz for my entire brow but I end up
grabbing that like I'll use more of a
thicker brow pencil or a pomade and then
I'll use the brow Wiz to get like the
tail of my brow or maybe to fill in just
little sparse areas you could absolutely
use it for your entire brow I mean I've
done that a million times as well it is
so good the shade range is perfect
everyone I know that uses that has been
able to find a perfect shade for them so
they also have these Hot Buys which is
every single day of these 21 days these
are always on sale but I would recommend
some of them will sell out so I would
recommend buy them like day one or two
so they have the bare minerals Jen nude
matte liquid lip colors those are $12
those are okay they're a comfortable
matte liquid lip but they are not a
traditional matte liquid lip lip where
they're like crazy like thick and
pigmented and they dry down they're very
different they're comfortable they're a
little more natural so if that's what
you're into
you'd like them they sent me every
single shade I don't really reach for
them they're just not my favorite if I'm
wanting that kind of a thing I'm gonna
reach for like my NARS Velvet lip glide
I freaking love these that's what I'm
wearing on my lips today I'm wearing it
in playpen they have the tarte maracuja
oil for twenty-five dollars I've never
tried that I might think about it they
have the tarte double duty Beauty
confidence creamy powder foundation for
21 dollars I might think about that I
really haven't heard anything about that
skipping through the laura geller
spackle collection is $19 they have the
spackle mist in their spackle under
makeup primer I tried both they're okay
I know the spackle mist is pretty highly
rated on the Beauty pedia website which
kind of rates things according to
skincare ingredients so that is nice if
you're into that the Fiona Styles light
illusion prism palette is 16 bucks I
might think about that I've never tried
Fiona Styles I know Tati loves Fiona
styles she talked about all the time so
I might think about that the Smashbox
photo Matt eyes palette is originally 49
it'll be 29 it's got a lot of colors in
there and I have to admit I've not
really loved Smashbox eyeshadows because
I tried their full exposure and it was
just I did not like it I returned it but
then I got their double exposure and I
liked that one way more so I might think
about it I don't really need it so I
might not spend the $30.00 benefit has
their their real push-up liner but you
have it says it's $12 but you have to
purchase a full-size of their they're
real black mascara so it's not really I
mean it's a good deal but only if you're
wanting both I've tried their push-up
liner and it just crumbled all over the
place I don't know if I got a bad batch
or what but I was not very impressed so
those are all of my recommendations and
things that I'm probably gonna go and
buy on my own during this huge sale
I'm so excited these sales are so
exciting but this is the first time I've
ever done a video of just about it I've
done video similar where like for Black
Friday I'll talk about the Sephora and
Ulta deals that they have but I've never
done it for this so if you enjoy this
kind of video let me know I would love
to do it every time they do they're 21
days of beauty and other than that I
hope you'll subscribe in the meantime
and say hi on my social media and I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
