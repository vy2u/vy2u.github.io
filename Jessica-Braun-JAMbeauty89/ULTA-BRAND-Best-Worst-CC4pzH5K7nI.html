gonna share with you my Ulta brand
Beauty review I've been trying all of
these Ulta brand products for about a
month and a half now so I really feel
like I have a good idea of how they work
if I'd recommend them or not so I'm
gonna do this Tryon style most of
everything you're seeing on my face is
all to beauty and you're gonna see me
apply it right now in this video so if
you enjoyed this style give it a thumbs
up I hope that you'll subscribe so that
you catch more of my beauty videos let's
go ahead an get into it all right so
I've already moisturized my face and put
some eye cream on lip balm on but I'm
gonna start with their fabulous face
foundation primer I should probably say
this is not sponsored I bought all of
these products on my own I was just
curious about the brand cuz I haven't
heard a lot from them so this is a clear
primer then I tend to focus more on the
center of my face where I feel like I
need it
and then I just kind of fan it out to
the outside I have typically dry skin
especially in these winter months when
I'm filming this and so I feel like
while I need that kind of extra hold on
the center of my face I don't always
feel like I need it everywhere so
regardless this is a very smooth primer
I even like to put it on my under eye
just because I feel like it kind of
fills in fine lines just a little bit
not I mean it's not gonna be perfect but
to me this was a nice primer but I felt
like there are a million versions of
this exact same kind of a primer so I
would say if you've never tried primer
it is a good one or if it's like a crazy
deal like Ulta will have sales like buy
one get one 50% off or whatever those
are the times that if you're in need of
a primer that's kind of more makes your
skin feel like velvet it makes your
foundation stay on really well then this
is totally a great primer but I just
feel like there are a million versions
of this in the drugstore that this one
doesn't necessarily stand out above the
rest but it is good so I've got that on
I let it sink in just for a little bit
it really sets pretty quickly I feel
like which is really nice and it does
make your skin feel really soft so the
foundation I picked out was the uLTA
Beauty HD soft focus liquid foundation
says natural finish paraben free
oil-free I got the shade light warm it's
an okay match for me it's not perfect I
think it's a little bit yellow but I've
worn it quite a bit and it's
worked you know what I mean so I'm gonna
use my lore'l sponge which I'll also
link below with my favorite one I use it
like every video and I'm just gonna
start by applying it to my face you can
see how it's kind of yellow Tom but I
think it's fine this has pretty nice
coverage but it's definitely a I don't
know like if you've got super dry skin
like me I don't think this is the ideal
foundation for you
it's much more mattifying than I
typically like so you could always put
super moisturizing like I showed in a
recent video what video was it where I
was putting on an oil like a primer oil
then a moisturizer then the foundation
oh it was my Estee Lauder Double Wear
kind of review I used to not like it and
I kind of like it now but that's because
I started putting that oil on so I just
feel like if you've got dry skin that is
a great idea for both this and that
Estee Lauder one but of course this
one's much cheaper I like that this has
a pump though I mean it does have some
good qualities to it and I do think it's
got pretty nice coverage I mean I feel
like my skin looks nice and flawless so
if you've got oily skin I think this
would be ideal for you especially when
you pair it with a good primer like I do
think that ultimate it but I don't think
it's the ideal combo if you have dry
skin have I said that enough I don't
know and as usual I get makeup on my
little cat your headbands and I have to
wash them all the time a lot of people
asked where I got this it came with some
PR thing from some I don't even remember
who it was so I can try to see if I can
find the brand of the actual headbands
cuz it is fun but I do have to wash it
all the time because I always get makeup
on geez do you guys like my Mickey straw
I'm drinking a lip call and it's the
pamphlet moose grapefruit anyway
Kylie always makes fun of me for
actually using these Mickey straws from
Disney we're all and I'm like dude it
brings me so much joy why would you not
it's like it takes so much more time to
get to your mouth I'm like yeah that's
half the fun alright so that is on let's
move on to the concealer next this is
the ultimate e full coverage liquid
concealer this has become my favorite
concealer did I just say begum it's
become my favorite concealer it's so
Coop's that's fine I mean
use it up there it's so like kind of gel
like kind of mu see almost the dough
foots really soft which I appreciate
since you're using it kind of on your
under eye typically but I tapped the
shade light cool light cool and I like
this so much better than the shape tape
then the Kat Von D I feel like again if
you've got dry skin or just general
crepeiness on your under eye i think
this sets really nicely it's kind of
moisturizing it doesn't dry too quickly
where you can't like move it to where
you need it to be I just really really
really like this concealer now like I
say about every concealer it still
settles into fine lines there's no
miracle concealer if you've got fine
lines like I do that just won't quit
then you know you can put primer under
there like I put a little of the
foundation primer to help but I mean
with any concealer it's gonna settle
into them a little bit and then you can
kind of tap it out but I know some
people use eye primer on their under eye
I've done that before it really didn't
help again I think it's just because my
fine lines want to show they're like
stop hiding me it's okay that you're
aging of it it's normal
oh my gosh I love that concealer so much
I really do it's sickening totally
recommend hi-hi highly recommend alright
so moving along I'm gonna quickly do my
brows and I'll be right back alright so
we're gonna move on to the eyes and
we'll come back to the face I'm gonna
use the uLTA Beauty matte eye primer and
nude this is another one I've totally
fallen in love with it's a little
squeezy too it's gonna take forever to
run through this whole thing because you
only need the tiniest bit but for me if
you've got a skin tone close to mine
this does a great job I'm cancelling out
any veining um that I have it just
discoloration but also it holds onto the
shadow really really well I think this
is a fantastic primer regardless of the
price point etc so it's even better like
I said earlier when you can find those
sales and I always used it's gonna sound
like a commercial no it's not sponsored
by them but I always use Ebates which I
can link below
it's my referral link but it's just a
website that you download a little tool
bar and anytime you're shopping online
which I feel like I rarely go into store
for Alton's Sephora like I'm always
I don't know why they're not that far
for me but I don't know I just shopping
online from the comfort of my own home
eyes are done so the palette I picked up
from Ulta was the melissa michelle
palette who i love here on youtube ever
watched her for years we are gonna use
the shadows in here and the blush in
highlight i have different ones i want
to try from the Ulta regular line we
will use her lip product cuz I do have
some thoughts about this but we're gonna
use the shadows um I let's see what look
do I want to do today I have to admit I
was super impressed with these shadows
so I'm gonna go in with Weezy here which
is just a kind of almond color and just
kind of put it all over my lid I always
start with the color like this for me
just to kind of get my whole eye space
ready so it nothing gets kind of stuck
in certain parts of that sticky primer
that way it's a little more even and I
do notice the difference when I do that
versus when I don't yeah like I feel
like my eye doesn't look as well blended
if I don't do it so I'm gonna go in with
rosemary here which i think is a really
pretty kind of light brownish mauve and
we're just gonna put that kind of into
the crease area it's gonna be our kind
of buffer color today I think this color
is so pretty and these you do have to
tap them off but they're really nice
shadows like I was genuinely super
impressed I was kind of prepared to be
like hmm but they are really nice I
can't wait for you guys to see these
shimmers if you haven't seen them before
they're gorgeous
as I always say at this point it might
be a little sloppy but it'll get cleaned
up no worries alright before we go any
deeper into the crease and darkening the
outer corner I do want to put on one of
these shimmers so we have like a really
pretty kind of almond why don't we keep
saying almond this is more like
champagne this is like a gorgeous gold
and then this is like a oranjee bronze
oh my gosh these are all so beautiful
but you can see there's a little bit of
powder but they are gorgeous so that
would just mean tap off your brush or if
you're doing it with your finger or
whatever I'm gonna do it with my finger
and I'm gonna use the kind of orangie
bronze cuz I just think it's so pretty
this one's called Katie's and I'm just
gonna
tap that and press it in you could use
like a glitter glue like I like the
Knicks glitter glue just on the lid to
do this but these are so shimmery I
don't feel like you need it and there
will be some fallout regardless so I've
used this with the glitter primer I have
the same amount of fallout so I figure
we can touch up and really I'm terrible
because with stuff like this I really
should do my eyes alone first then go in
with concealer but I just don't like
doing it that I don't know why I like
it's so ingrained in me to do it in the
order I'm used to doing it so it's so
hard for me to switch it up so I never
do and then I just deal with fallout I
don't know anyone else like that like
you know there's gonna be fallout to
clean up but you're still like mmm but
I'm sudden I do my foundation first I
don't know what's wrong with me isn't
that an amazing color so it needs to be
blended of course so I'm just gonna kind
of wipe off the big fluffy brush I was
using earlier this is the Sigma e-40 a
million brand sell this same thing just
kind of blend out the edges just a tinge
I'm gonna get a fluffy kind of wipe off
the fallout so that is one negative
thing about this there is fallout
there's ways to get around it like I
mentioned but frankly there's a ton of
fallout in the Natasha de Nona palette
so it's like you can spend one hundred
and sixty-nine dollars to two hundred
dollars on the palette and have the same
amount of fall so I can't I almost don't
fault this for that because you see that
in a lot of price ranges but I love how
pinyons it is so to darken up that kind
of crease
I'm gonna use my morphe 441 brush I can
link these below the brush as I
mentioned and I'm gonna go into bingbing
which is this kind of red burnt red
color and I'm just gonna start in the
outer corner and kind of just work that
into the outer part of my crease and a
little bit further in
so I'm gonna go back into rosemary that
we started with in our crease just to
kind of help blend that on the edges a
little bit make it look a little bit
more seamless so to make the kind of
center of my lid pop a little I'm gonna
try I haven't done this yet try this
Lola one just right in the center it's
pretty go for the lower lashline before
I do my brow bone I'm going to will go
ahead and do Bingbing as well because I
want it to kind of be a dramatic look so
I'm gonna go back in with that light
color and just carve out my brow bone
just a little bit with a little
synthetic brush I'm gonna take a little
of this highlighter just like this side
of it and put that on my brow bone as
well just to make it pop a little bit
more I'll do this a lot just with
whatever highlighter I'm wearing that
day but I figure we might as well put a
little of this since I'm not gonna be
wearing it as my highlight just to pop
that brow bone just a tinge so moving a
long let's go ahead and do liners so I
do have a couple of liners from them I
have the Ulta gel eyeliner now this is a
pencil that you have to sharpen it's
really creamy but I almost it's really
creamy really black but sometimes it can
be so creamy that it like slides too
much when I'm putting it on which is
like you zurer totally but you might
know it like if you ever have tried this
one I think you might know what I mean
but it's a good liner so I'm just gonna
kind of put a long way lash line a bit
and then I also bought their gel
eyeliner in the pot this has also become
a favorite of mine it kicked my favorite
L'Oreal lacquer liner out of my everyday
makeup drawer I have loved usiness but I
really love pairing it with this very
specific brush it's not an Ulta brush
but it's still worth mentioning it's the
Dell iam tools 761 tight liner it's the
tiniest little brush and it makes
so easy to apply this now this gel liner
is really really creamy again kind of
slippery like the other one but it's so
black it stays in place once it sets and
it's oh my gosh I've just fallen in love
with it we're gonna clean up that wing
with a liquid liner here in just a
second so I'm just gonna use I didn't
buy a liquid liner from Ulta this is my
favorite NYX epic ink liner my favorite
liquid liner of all time just to clean
up the outer wing is usually what I use
it for
alright so I'm gonna do the mascara at
the very end let's go and do the rest of
my face
so the bronze Roman auo before I use the
bronzer this was an awesome find
and actually you guys told me about this
is the ultimate e adjustable coverage
foundation this is a wet slash dry that
was a good catch Jessica good job this
is the wet slash dry pressed powder
which I was telling you one of the rules
I break like the bad things that I do it
is I will take a wet sponge and go right
into a powder foundation and put it on
because it gives so much awesome
coverage but I feel like it totally
ruins the powder that I'm doing that to
over time which it does but this is
meant to be used that way so we're gonna
throw a little more coverage just
because I wanted you guys to see this
stuff is so good it dries back down to
normal so it doesn't get weird like this
is the answer to my prayer so I'm so
glad to have this because when I'm not
using it wet I don't have to use this
but when I am I'm like so it's kind of
gonna become like one of those travel
companion wants to me too because I love
doing this when I'm traveling if we've
been out like shopping or sightseeing
throughout the day and then in the
evening we're freshening up to go back
out like maybe for dinner and I want to
look nicer this is an awesome way to
kind of freshen your face up and make it
look flawless again without starting
over reapplying foundation and so that's
why I've done it for years but I'm glad
to have the right product to do it so I
do like that to be honest I haven't used
it a ton dry just because I was so
excited to have it wet but I I mean it's
just a really good coverage powder
foundation but it definitely is
mattifying as you can tell so the Browns
are going to use is their Ulta matte
bronzer in warm by the way the pressed
powder I have is in fair I think that's
the lightest shade but I'm using the
bronzer in warm and we're just gonna put
a little bit here just a little bit up I
don't feel like I need to go too too
crazy today but this bronzer is good I
mean there's nothing bad about it I'll
say that it's good but I feel like there
again there's so many good bronzers so
if you've got a good sale or an Ulta
gift card whatever
go for it there's nothing wrong with it
at all but again it's not something that
stands out it's like holy moly this is
the best bronzer I've ever used but it
is good there's nothing I can pick at
this that's wrong with it
I think it's nice and pigmented I think
it definitely warms up the skin maybe in
my case a little bit too much I don't
know but I like it a lot for blush I'm
going to use their mineral blush in
peony and it's it's a kind of a smaller
pan but you don't really need one bigger
than this for blush so I'm just gonna
apply that to the apples of my cheeks
again I think it's a good blush
I feel like again you can't go wrong
with most brands of blush most of them
will do a good job they'll stay on
really well I think long gone are the
days where you need to spend $30 for a
good blush I don't even know if those
days were ever here but I mean the
drugstore makes so many amazing bronzers
and blushes that you don't have to spend
a lot of course this one's not crazy
expensive either but I do like it I like
the shade I think it's really nice and
kind of feminine and flirty so the
highlighter I'm using is their
illuminator sheer radiant finish and
pink diamond this does have kind of a
cool shift to it like it's like a pink
shift to the ivory color when you put it
I mean do you guys see that it is kind
of cool very kind of on trend these days
so just apply a little bit
you guys know me I don't love the
shouting from the rooftops highlight but
I do and I I think this could be like
you could apply this a lot you know you
saw my swatch it can certainly look ooh
it can look as vibrant as you want it to
look but I'm using more of a kind of
fluffy brush because I don't want it to
look as vibrant as some all right so do
I recommend the hot the highlighter yes
I do think it's really nice I think it's
not very powdery at all it's actually
really nice and creamy especially if you
like this kind of a shift you can make
it look natural or really highlighting
it's totally up to you how much you
apply but I do actually really like it
alright so let's go ahead and do mascara
let me curl my lashes really quickly so
the mascara I'm using is the Ulta you t
plush drama volumizing mascara
so this is one coat on my eyes I like
this mascara but again you know it
doesn't get super clumpy it does add
some volume but I just didn't feel like
overwhelmed with like holy-moly this is
such a great mascara so if you're
looking at the Ulta line as I keep
saying and there's a sale I don't think
it's bad but it's certainly not
something that I'm gonna repurchase when
I run out because I think they're a
better mascaras out there like the
l'oreal lash paradise is one of my
personal favorites but the but there are
so many others like the l'oreal
voluminous is really good that's a cult
classic the it cosmetics superhero is
not drugstore but it is amazing alright
so i've done two coats on both i just
feel like it it makes my lashes feel
stubby like even when i'm doing them
like it adds a little bit of length but
not as much length as I'm kind of used
to mascara adding and while I do think
it does volume eyes I just again I think
there's better stuff out there so I'll
use it I'll use it some more but I feel
like the days that I use it later on in
the day I look in the mirror and I'm
like this mascara and what's funny is
the first few times I used it I actually
really liked it I think I even snapped
about it and that's why it is so
important to do these kinds of reviews
where I've tried it for a while because
I did kind of change my mind on it quite
a bit we're gonna do this lip this matte
liquid lipstick let me show you it's in
the shade by the way scandi
all right so this is the completed look
this liquid lipstick I don't know I
wasn't a big fan I don't know I think
this is the exact same matte liquid
lipstick that comes like in their normal
line this is just the one she chose to
have with her palette I think the color
is really nice it's a color that's very
trendy it looks gorgeous on her I think
it looks okay on my skin tone too I just
feel like it gets dry but like sticky as
I wear it throughout the day and with
some like I've had some kind of more
whipped liquid lipsticks that I've liked
that didn't totally dry down and they
were kind of sticky but I didn't mind it
but this is the kind of sticky that I do
mind like it just bothers me all like
the whole time I'm talking and I end up
wiping off after a couple hours because
I can't stand it so I wouldn't recommend
these but I know this is some people's
cup of tea but you guys know me I'm a
broken record but I'm kind of moving
beyond this matte liquid lipstick trend
anyway so and that would be why cuz I
just don't like the way it feels on my
lips I don't like it wait like what I
don't like the way it makes my lips look
either out of all of these products what
products would I buy again like if it
broke in half or someone took it and I
thought oh man which ones would I buy
again my recommendations would be ET
full coverage liquid concealer when I
run out I will buy again so that is a
definite repurchase would totally
recommend GM V 289 stamp of approval
amazing concealer I would also buy again
the matte eye primer again it's really
really good better than a lot of
high-end ones I've tried I like this
better than the Too Faced shadow
insurance and I liked that for a long
time but I think this just does a better
job and I like that it's really matte so
totally would repurchase would totally
repurchase the gel eyeliner in the pot I
will repurchase when I run out I just
love it I think the ease of use is
fantastic it stays on all day it's super
black definitely gets my stamp of
approval the products that I wouldn't
recommend oh then I would also recommend
this palette like I said I was kind of
ready to not like it the blush by the
way I don't think i swatched it is
gorgeous it's called mahal which you
guys told me means love really pigmented
gorgeous color and the highlight is
really pretty too although I think the
illuminating highlighter that I showed
earlier is better but if this
that were sold just like this oh my gosh
like I would highly recommend it either
way so I think it is kind of pricey I
want to say this is around 20 dollars if
not a little more but again Oulton sale
like every other week so that would be
the time to buy it but I really really
was impressed with the shadows now the
products that I wouldn't recommend that
you know they might end up in a regrets
video slash I don't even know that I'll
end up using them up would be the
mascara I just it was okay
primer I don't think I would ever put
this I don't think I put this primer in
a regrets video because I don't think
there's anything really wrong with it
but I again I just didn't feel like it
was like shout from the rooftops this is
so amazing like I felt about the other
products so well I think it's good it's
not one that I would ever repurchase and
same goes for this foundation I just
feel like it makes my skin look older
and drier than it is you know you're
seeing this and in the camera when I
first freshly applied it but when I
would look at myself in virtually any
mirror whether it's at work in my car
when I'm in the bathroom I just always
felt like like it just looks like cheap
not cheap skin but like I've got a cheap
foundation on that's just really sucking
the life out of my skin so that's just
kind of how I feel about it I think
there are better mattifying foundations
out there like the L'Oreal infallible is
pretty darn mattifying if you like that
again that's not always my cup of tea
but I know that it is super mattifying
super high coverage and I think it looks
better on the skin than this does and
then the rest of the ones I mention oh
and like I said the liquid lipstick is
another one that I just wasn't impressed
super drying but also sticky it's like
the two worst things about liquid
lipsticks are both true for this one and
the rest of them are products that I
really did like like the wet and dry
powder foundation I really did like I
probably will repurchase just to have
that as an option and then the rest of
them I just thought were good
well I repurchase them I probably won't
need to like the bronzer blush I
probably won't run out of those but they
were really nice so hopefully this video
