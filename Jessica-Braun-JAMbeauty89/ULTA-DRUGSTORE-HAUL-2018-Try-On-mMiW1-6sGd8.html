literally look like Rudolph this is real
life okay today we're gonna be doing in
Ulta haul but we're gonna do it Tryon
style I haven't done this in a while and
I think it's so fun to do and it's it's
fresh and early in the morning and I'm
drinking my first cup of coffee and it's
like oh I just love coffee so much you
know of course I'm pregnant start to
limit it so like this this first cup is
like everything but today's mug of
choice is Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket
and I just love that I think that's so
cute we got it on sale like on clearance
on the Disney website or some anyway so
today I bought one two three four five
six seven eight things at Ulta that
we're gonna try on and I'm so excited
these are products I'd ask you guys
about I was like I'm placing an order at
Ulta well let me show you why I was
placing an order don't mind my pj pants
okay okay okay okay so I needed to buy
my favorite hairspray because you guys
tweeted me and snapped me and mr. grabby
everyone was letting you know that my
favorite favorite hairspray of all time
the Bed Head masterpiece hairspray was
it's originally $23 and I'm like I know
I'd never buy it full price I always
wait first sale well it was $9.99 and
I'm like done so I bought two more and I
already had like maybe one more on
backup so I bought these two and I was
like well if I'm gonna pay for shipping
I might as well buy more and I think in
the end I had spent over whatever amount
you have to do for free shipping anyway
this is why I was placing an order in
the first place
so I asked you guys oh Jessica I asked
you guys on social media what I'm gonna
go ahead and put on a serum and
moisturizer while I'm waiting these are
not haul items but it's the number seven
early defense glow activating serum they
recently sent to me and I've been trying
it I do like it it's more of like a
lotion II serum but I have been really
liking it the past few weeks anyway
so you guys were tell I I'm sorry you
guys this video is gonna be all over the
place I'm excited to be filming can you
tell so I asked you guys what do you
recommend from Ulta what are some very
specific products or brands that you
feel like you already love or you're
just curious about that you don't hear a
lot about so I've got
from Catrice sleek model zone that's
another Catrice one well Oh makeup
revolution and flower beauty so I'm
excited all of these these products are
actually really pretty too when you see
the packaging of these you're gonna be
like those are drugstore prices and
they're all really pretty so anyway I'm
telling you my brain is in 10,000 places
I'm so sorry if that annoys you I can't
help it
so if you were curious I did use the
masterpiece hairspray I kind of dry
shampoos my hair today and just throw
threw it up in a messy bun it's just one
of those days but I always dry shampoo
and then if I'm gonna do it in a bun of
any kind I always use the hairspray just
all over my hair to get it kind of give
it that texture and that's why I love
that hairspray it smells good and it's
almost like a texturizing spray at the
same time anyway
so I'm gonna use my stupid expensive
cosmetics humidify deep moisture and
firming hydrator this stuff is $90 you
guys it is no joke though it is the most
moisturizing oh I love it so much this
one I got through octa Lee but I when I
run out I'm buying another one I I have
to it's the best I have all the moisture
I love for different purposes but right
now in the dead of winter this is
exactly what my skin needs but I've been
trying another one from Saturday skin
that I really like and it's like their
featherweight moisturizer I can also
link below that one is really nice under
makeup but this is even better right now
because my skin is so dry and I feel
like it's just like healed everything up
so I have noticed that I've had a little
like red splotchiness like right here
I've heard that that's kind of like the
mask of pregnancy I'm not trying to
bring out that I'm pregnant
I know I know I don't know but just that
I I think it really is affecting Christ
kit and so I definitely that's something
that today when I'm getting ready I'll
definitely want to cover up already so
the first actual product for the haul is
this Catrice cosmetics look at this
packaging light correcting serum primer
it says it's in the shade candle light
and the way they describe it is it's a
liquid primer with aloe vera contains
lip contains light reflecting pigments
for a subtle glow on the skin my
flattering candlelight shimmer use alone
or under
so it says shake well so I'm gonna use
this as my primer today we're just gonna
see how it looks I haven't been using
full-on primers every single day lately
just because again I feel like I just
need to give my skin a break so the only
primers I've really been using has been
like hydrating ones because I'm just
noticing that the pore filling ones the
smoothing ones those are kind of making
my skin look worse than it is and I'm
like I don't need that right now I don't
need that in my life so it is a dropper
bottle well let's just give her a whirl
that's funny okay oh oh it has a
fragrance for sure and it does even
though it's in a dropper bottle it ends
up spreading out almost lotion like you
know what I mean it doesn't feel but
it's really soft really soft gotta do my
eyebrows there um oh I'm feeling it
start to pill up okay so you've got to
be careful I should probably just press
it in instead of rub it so once you kind
of get it in the spots I would say just
let it because otherwise and really
pilling happens when it's kind of
reacting to what you have on underneath
it I've kind of learned more and more
that it's not really the fault of a
primer it's more just that you know so
that it has those priming qualities
that's something that can happen if
you're putting it on on top of maybe a
really thick moisturizer it just depends
and I notice more often it happens to me
like in these regions here like I said
it did have a slight fragrance I
definitely feel like there's like a
sheen to my face but not like glitter
which i think is really nice and it made
my skin feel really really soft really
soft but it still feels moisturize like
I don't feel like it made it look dry
which is great cuz that was my concern
so so far I'm really enjoying since this
is a haul I will do an update video
maybe in a month or so letting you guys
know now that I've worked with these
products for a month how do I like them
you know kind of my final thoughts my
actual review this is just more for fun
so you guys can see how they work on my
skin at first but I always like to
follow through with that
so that there's a point you know so the
other primer I had bought I think it is
this flower beauty in your prime
hydrating primer first of all the color
of this this like periwinkle blue is so
pretty that's one of my favorite colors
but I can't really use both but I do
want to at least watch this you guys can
feel and again in that update I'll
definitely let you know and I get ready
in the mornings like on work mornings on
my snapchat so if you're curious to see
what products I'm trying I always show
on there at least a couple products in
the mornings and how they look on my
skin etc so this is probably one that I
would try on their just since I didn't
get to try both on here but it's just a
squeezy bottle again the packaging is
pretty flower beauties packaging is
always pretty
it's a white primer I don't notice the
smell at all which I appreciate
especially flower beauty in their
earlier days had a lot of floral scented
stuff and I think it turned me off I
know it turned a lot of people off it
feels it does feel hydrating it kind of
turns into a more gel like feel once you
blend it out but it it feels very
smoothing but definitely more hydrating
which again that's the kind of primer
I'm all about right now so I am very
excited this is one I was one of the
first things I added to my cart honestly
based on the way it looked but it feels
really nice and for our beauty is now
sold at Ulta and that's how I bought it
which is very exciting because before
you'd have to buy it on their website or
on what or at Walmart and I've heard
that some Walmart's just don't have it
at all I don't know if the plan is to
pull them out of all Walmart's and only
be sold at Ulta and flowers website I
don't know let me know if you know cuz I
am kind of curious I'm gonna put on a
foundation foundation and then I'll come
back so we can try a new concealer that
like 50 of you guys asked me to try oh
I'm just gonna go ahead and show you
what I've been putting on because this
is a $22 BB cream and it is the best BB
cream I've ever tried $22 can seem steep
when you're just comparing it to
strictly drugstore however there are a
lot of BB creams out there that are like
$40 and so the fact that this one's 22
you can buy it on targets website I
recently learned I have another straight
number 23 the
is shade range absolutely terrible
absolutely terrible I'm hoping that now
that Misha is sold in the u.s. that
they're going to be expanding that range
because they were so used to the skin
tones from where they were and I think
you guys told me this is a Korean brand
so that's what I'm holding out hope for
but it has really nice coverage just a
it's a squeezy bottle but it actually
has a pump and here's how I've been
applying it the past few weeks just hold
on
do you see how great it is though I like
that for my skin and a lot of them have
a lot of the shades have this great int
again because of the skin tones they're
used to working with but I feel like it
really neutralizes my skin it's got SPF
in it I love this stuff now here's the
thing the coverage is pretty darn good
for a BB cream as you can tell but it's
not flawless I go ahead and put it
around my eyes too it's not like the
most flawless coverage but for me it's
plenty and by rubbing it in with my
hands I'm having less of like the weird
dryness dry patches sticking out like I
have virtually none all day long and
that is amazing so I always take the
time to kind of blend it down I love
this stuff I feel like it makes my skin
look healthy I think that primer
underneath it looks really nice because
I think it I don't always wear a primer
with this and so I'll go straight from
that really good moisturizer to my BB
cream and I feel like it'll look a
little oilier I feel like this that
Katrice primer kind of toned it down
just enough that it still looks nice and
glowy but it's not like way too much um
so oh I love this stuff so I'll link
this as well alright I always had to
wash my hands after doing that because
my I hate having things on my fingers so
the concealer that so many of you guys I
hadn't even heard of this but all of you
guys are like you go to try it is the
revolution did I call Catrice I don't
know revolution concealed and defined
full coverage concealer on tour I think
this supposed to be a dupe for the shape
- oh definitely so big old dough foot
really pretty packaging
this packaging is prettier than the
chart shape tape I have a love-hate with
chart shape tape
I used way too much early on learned
that the hard way like whoa way too much
is is is too much but I've grown to like
it more as long as I'm super moisturized
under my eyes if I'm not it's just a
little bit too drying but it is
beautiful I mean that's one of those I
wouldn't not recommend it but it I know
so many people it's the Holy Grail
that's just not mine but I do like it so
I'm excited I'm kind of hoping this is
just a little bit more hydrated I got in
the shade see too so I'm just gonna use
a little bit then I don't know how much
is a little bit with this if I've never
used it um and we'll just see I'm just
gonna use a Beauty Blender and just kind
of tap it in just see I think that might
be said a little too yellow for me I
think this is the second shade up from
the lightest shade maybe it's okay
definitely brightening oh man
it definitely sinks into my finding
lines a little bit not unlike any other
concealer I don't think it's too
terrible though that I wouldn't
recommend it you know what I mean some
are really bad where it's like okay no
but this is like the standard amount but
it's definitely really brightening a
little bit does go a long way I am going
to because I know I want to cover some
of my redness but I don't want to put on
like a whole foundation because I don't
really need it I'm just gonna use a
little bit to kind of cover little spots
it might be too brightening on that but
I know why not give it a whirl
because I know that's where redness
starts peeping through once I start
putting like blush on and stuff and just
a nice area to brighten anyway kind of
your highlight region and then that I
just want to cover that redness so not
great at covering up redness and it's
not really only meant to be a you know
blemish concealer and then those moments
just aren't that bad anyway but let's
use a little bit on my nose though
because it's still red because it always
is and I usually use powder foundation
to help with that and I probably will
today too but I just want to see how
does it do
covered it okay
my nose does anyone else have this
problem this is like my whole life a red
nose like it's not because of what's
going on my like now it's like my whole
life so red that's okay so um verdict so
far I really do like it
and again it's inexpensive cute
packaging no flood is nice do I think
you'll need to set your under eye
probably I mean I'm just looking at my
own like who that keeps creeping right
into there so you'll want to set your
under eye for sure but let me go ahead
and do a little bit more on my face and
then we'll come back in with some other
stuff we're gonna try alrighty we are
Brown up let's go do the rest of my face
I did throw on a powder foundation this
is my favorite of all time if you were
just curious it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination so this is the
one that's just a little bit
illuminating but I put it all over it's
meant to be used all over and I just
love it it makes my dry skin not look
dry and yet it still provides a lot more
coverage you can tell but like you can
still see a little glow oh my gosh this
stuff is amazing this like I think I got
in PR years ago and I have bought with
my own money a million times cents so I
have to Ron's errs to try out this is
the Catrice sun lover glow bronzing
powder so I got it in the shade 0:10
sunkissed bronze it's got this kind of
baked Marbley look to it it's really
soft though I think baked products
sometimes you can get them and they
might appear like they might be rough
but this is a really soft one and I love
that it's a soft bronze look if you've
got fair skin the other one I bought
here's the little box but it's the
models own sculpting glow matte bronzing
powder I got it in the lightest shade
light tan zero one that's still pretty
that is bronze and very very orange
Pinnochio leave me alone oh come on in
okay come on come so I'm kind of cheese
oh my gosh you're my dream you can just
set it on there I'll just take a break
from filming okay so as I was eating
breakfast I was looking in the mirror I
put on more of this concealer because I
was like dang
like it really in bright lights it might
catch it really nicely where it looks
nice but in real life lights it I look
really old
I mean I'm 29 that's enough but really I
mean it's really emphasizing them so and
it's not covering the blueness which a
lot of concealers don't you can use
correctors for I use different
correctors for from time to time but for
the purpose of this video this video I
wanted to see it so I put on just a
little bit more and I used a brush this
time and kind of the same thing so I
don't know again I'm gonna keep toying
with it if I had really really
moisturize my under eyes before I think
it might look better so when I do the
update I'll definitely let you know if
that's worked but I just wanted to share
that kind of realization I had just had
so back to the bronzers this is the
model zone one it's a lot more orangie
toned right here I think I'm gonna try
the Catrice one just because I'm
interested to try and I like that it's
more a better match for me I'm weird and
I like to use smaller brushes for
bronzer I don't have a sheep I mean at
my foreheads okay size but it's not that
big so when I use a big brush it just
ends up like covering my whole forehead
so I'm gonna use this brush it's a
smaller one and I just like to throw
kind of in the contour area even though
it's not technically a contour shade and
then just a little bit near the hairline
hold my hair back here
I really am liking this I think I got a
little heavy-handed that's alright I
mean it is what it is you can always
grab like a beauty sponge you've been
using you can always grab a powder
foundation kind of blend that back in
and I might do that but I'm really I
really like the shade of this the tone
of this the packaging is pretty not that
matters but it kind of does I got two
blushes from sleek now I tried a long
time ago some of they're like three pan
blush things
the thing about sleek is their brushes
their blushes are such bright vivid
colors and they swatch accordingly that
I'm always intimidate
so I ended up getting rid of the few
ones I had a long time ago and I'm
talking a couple years ago so these I
like the simplicity of their little
packaging whoa
so this is take a shine and it is bright
pink that is no joke let's see the other
shade this is in showdown okay yeah this
is gosh it's almost a bronzer but I feel
like it could be like a peachy tone
blush and that's why I bought it but
looking at it it really is no just a
buzzer fight for me for someone else it
might be more of a peachy blush that's
like the same as the bronzer Oh Jesse
why don't we go for this bright pink why
not I'll just make sure I use a really
light hand so I got plenty on the brush
but let me I'm gonna tap it off and I'm
gonna use like a little clean washcloths
to literally wipe some of it off
okay I feel like it's hard with with um
blushes like this because if you use the
light hand but it's not perfectly even
you want to keep evening it out and then
it just looks like patchy you know what
I'm saying
that's why I like those lighter blushes
for me for my skin tone because it's
just easier to not screw up but if
you've got a darker deeper skin tone
this could be absolutely gorgeous so I
want to look into if you've got a shade
like if you're maybe near my skin tone
you know of a shade that works really
well please let me know cuz I like the
formula it's a really thin but pigmented
blush formula and it stays on I do
remember that it stays on all day I'm
gonna use my powder foundation just to
kind of tone that blush down there's
nothing more annoying to me on my own
face then like splotchy blush like
that's something that I will instantly
write something off and say nope I hate
it if it always looks splotchy on I
think that's a little bit better so this
is not a new highlight I just wanted to
share it it's the essence pure nude they
sell it at Ulta super cheap I have it in
the shade 10 be my highlight and I'm
using the new Milani all-over blending
brush it's funny that's called Oliver
blending it's totally like a highlight
blush but I just love this stuff I feel
like it makes my skin look so healthy
and glowy
and it's not crazy subtle but it's not
crazy pigmented and I think that's why
I'm so obsessed with it uh so the last
new product is like that I bought for
this haul is from Catrice and it's their
prime and fine brightening eyeshadow
base
Jessica do you already own this I know
that I've tried a Catrice eye primer but
this one when I saw it online I'm like
oh it's gonna be like a white eye primer
yeah see it is and I've been really good
I've gotten into white primers so much
lately
maybe I don't already on this cuz this
is nice this is really brightening
like.we I'm diggin that here's what I
like a lot of white primers I have are
really really thick so that they hold
onto the shadow and I really like that
on my lid but like for all over
intensification this blends way better
than a lot of the other ones I've used
so that alone is pretty darn impressive
now do I think this is white enough to
really make something pop like crazy no
but do I think it's still gonna help a
lot yeah if you're wanting it to pack a
punch so I went ahead and finish my
makeup I did end up putting some lashes
on - these are like not crazy though I'm
diggin these are the if you're curious
cuz I'm like terrible lashes drawers
open everywhere okay these are the
Ardell natural lashes 110 so I had to
cut them cuz my I guess my eyes are
short this way so I always have to cut
lashes like literally always they're
always gonna put them on I'm like why is
it going up to here anyway this is the
first time I've tried these specific
ones and I like them I feel like they're
more natural but they still kind of pull
the look together cuz I don't wear
lashes everyday I am like amazed but I
feel like dude I'm like dude I don't
have the patience no freaking way anyway
I'm so I ended up finishing the look I
did use these Milani palettes that are
new at the drugstore that are
unbelievable so if that video is up
where I'm showing you how I got the eye
look I will link it below if it is not
subscribed stay tuned and then what's on
my lips is the new pixi by petra mat
last liquid lip and pastel
I just love this color I'm not a huge
fan of liquid lips anymore but whoo I
never really was but these are just a
little bit more comfortable they're
almost sticky but I love this color with
my lips I've got really pigmented lips
and it's hard to find neutrals that
cover it enough that still look good I
don't know how to describe that but
anyway I really like this formula a lot
and so and this is my favorite shade so
I will link those below as well but
other than that I hope you enjoyed I
hope you'll subscribe give it a thumbs
up if you like this style of haul like a
try on haul and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
