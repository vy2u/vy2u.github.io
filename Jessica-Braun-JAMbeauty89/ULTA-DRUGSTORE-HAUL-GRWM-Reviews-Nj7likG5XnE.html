going to show you how I got ready using
a bunch of new products that I bought it

products I splashed in are just from a
regular drugstore or from Sephora as
well because I didn't buy enough from

but I wanted to get ready with you
showing you a full face so I use Ebates

take my word for it you can take other
people's work for it as well if you
enjoy this style of video please
subscribe give it a thumbs up so that I
know and stick around for more videos
otherwise let's go ahead and get into it
so the first thing I'm putting on is my
Kota Levy no perfect radiance serum I
love this I did a video with them in the
past this is not a video with them but I
love this I put it on every single
morning it takes into my skin sofa next
thing I want to use is from the ordinary
it's their natural moisturizing factors
+ H a and it's their service surface
hydration formula it's just a
moisturizer and it's really really good
also going to use my clinic
start eye cream which I've just been
using a lot it's okay I don't think you
need to spend the money on something
like this if it's just a morning you
know you can use whatever you're using
technically a lot of experts say you
don't need a separate eye cream you can
just use your regular moisturizer I just
like I cranes oops I've got a little
gunk on my eye group I just like using
eye creams it's just one of those things
that I guess I'm weird about so I've
been using this in the morning so I use
a different one at night so I'm going to
use this models own face based it's a
face primer and it's there
illuminating I've tried this once this
week and it is glittery straight-up
glittery I'm going to use this you guys
can see how it works that it is truly
turtle pink glittery so it has a squeezy
tube but they have to pump on the end
which I love it has a kind of beige
color to it um just kind of lightly
buffing Shree lighting liners way off to
the side there we go there we go umm
it's a very very illuminating
listen you guys I wish you could have
seen me I was laughing so hard to get a
morning I was tired it's been you know
you're tired and you just are like
maniacal in ways I was cracking out
alone early in the morning getting ready
for work because there's so much glitter
in this I mean it's just pure glitter
look at my face right now and I have dry
skin so I don't know I don't know it
looks alright under the foundation but I
don't think it extended the wear of my
foundation and it's just so glittery I
just don't think that I like this and
I've only used it twice so I'll use it
some more but this lip balm I love I
just put on um is it's the shea moisture
African water mint and ginger shea
butter lip balm and I just kind of
randomly saw it online and thought I'm
going to try that and I'm glad I did so
cheap it feels amazing my lips are
living it so they have two different
foundations I can put on I have tried
both this week this is the buxom show
some skin weightless foundation and I
got it the shade fair makes it fair game
I guess maybe that's the shade name fair
game but I also got the Urban Decay
Naked skin weightless ultra definition
liquid makeup says it's peptide infused
light diffusing paraben free and I got
it in the shade 1.0 so the buxom one is
a little bit more coverage than the
naked skin want and I think since I'm
building today that's what I would like
to do the naked skin one is a lot
thinner you have to shake it and it I'll
show you the formula even though I'm not
using it it's a very liquidy formula
very very liquidy and you can apply with
your fingers with the brush with the
Beauty Blender anytime you use
Beauty sponge is going to share it out a
little bit more but I still like this
applied best with the Beauty Blender now
with your fingers it's okay with the
brush it stays on a little bit better
but sometimes I feel like you can see
the lines of it a little bit more and
when I say see the lines I mean like the
brush just kind of brushes it back and
forth it never fully blends in
but the buxom one is a little bit more
high coverage as I said I'll use a brush
for this today just so you can really
see I typically use a Beauty Blender but
I'm just curious to see how it does it
the brush I think there's actually a
decent shade match for me it's a little
bit because it brings my facial skin
closer to what my actual skin tone is if
that makes sense
and I'm just going to use my my Lagoo or
blush I got brush I got on Amazon for
like 12 bucks I'll link it below I think
it's just as good as you our teeth ones
and I've done a video about that but
this gives just you know a decent amount
of coverage remember what it says
weightless to show some skin so I think
the idea is that you can still see your
skin but it just looks a little bit more
beautified so I would say this is
probably medium coverage foundation I
look like an oil slick right now and I
really think it's that primer because I
wore this foundation with like a regular
primer and I feel like it won't go much
better so I think this foundation is
best with like if you have oily skin
especially with a very mattifying primer
even if you have dry skin I feel like
you should use a more like pore filling
mattifying primer just because itself is
a very natural kind of satin look and
it's looking so greasy over this really
greasy fund at that greasy primer of
that is a regret of mine I'm going to
use this expensive but I'm glad because
it's so expensive it's like a joke I did
not buy this this I got for free through
oxalate and I posted a long time ago
I've talked about this as a regret I
didn't buy it but like it's something I
didn't really think was worth the money
I'm starting to change my mind and I
don't mean go out and buy this because I
I'll stand by the fact that nothing diss
expensive should be I don't know it's
just too expensive but my skin any time
I've tried this out has looked so much
more oh my gosh like flawless by the end
of day and when I say pause I mean my
skin whatever I put on stays the blush
that anything I put on top of it does
not budge it's kind of the craziest
thing oh that's way too much Jessica but
I like I've been really enjoying setting
my face with this lately that might be
too much because it really is making it
look more flawless than like anything
else as like ever her pieces it's kind
of crazy and do you see how much more
mattified instantly my skin is but I do
think you can get even high-end products
that are half the price of this that do
the same thing I just because I have it
I've been trying it more than one that's
really good so I do I should have waited
to set I always do this because I do
have concealers so I have this Becca
under-eye brightening corrector that I
purchased I hadn't really heard much
about and I haven't even tried this it
is a packaging ridiculous it's that
beautiful rose gold totally sucks you in
but it's so pretty
so I think I'm going to try this but I'm
also going to try my Laura Geller the
real deal concealer I'm going to just
going to try both and I got this in the
shade light the Becca one by the way is
just the it's just one shade it's their
brightening under eye corrector so I'm
going to use the under eye corrector
just a little bit just in the corners
where I have kind of bluish tones and
then I'll use the concealer just like
underneath my eye and stuff like that
I'm just going to tap this in with my
finger it looks like it's cancelling it
out pretty well what do you guys think
it was one covered with my finger what
do you guys think I don't think like
it's completely gone so let's try I know
that this laura geller stuff I did use
it once this week and it is like they
say series coverage I'm never going to
run out of it you know if you use the
tiniest amount and it reminds me of like
the glamoflage which is like it
soare version oh my gosh now this is the
lightest shade and look it's like I
think a little bit too like orange
yellow for me but let's do it anyway I'm
going to use a drugstore brush this is
part of that
Moda line where they have like all the
different brushes at Walmart I actually
really like it so I'm going to use this
smaller one to blend this in I haven't
done it with a brush yet they usually
use a sponge and buy usually I mean the
one time I've used so you can still see
my fine line but and again I could have
used a fourth of what I just used it's
spreading like all the way across the
face but I do think it's got pretty good
coverage it is definitely settling into
my fine lines so that's kind of my
verdict with that I think it's nice do I
think this is worth the higher price I
don't know I feel like you get the hard
candy glamoflauge and it does the exact
same thing and it's like six or seven
bucks pixie on one that's a little bit
cheaper you can get at Target it's there
correcting concentrate and brightening
peach but let me show you the tone
difference between these when you look
at just the pants it looks like there's
not really a huge difference but there
really is the pixie one is a lot more
deeper and a lot less creamy than the
becca one it just depends on what you
like I think the Beca one looks a little
bit more natural but I think the pixie
one might have higher coverage so you
got to kind of keep that in mind and I
know the pixie one I think they do have
a couple of shades so at least you could
maybe mix maybe they do have a lighter
shade than I just in a tea that would be
closer to the Becca one alright brows
are done I use my Anasazi a dip brow and
medium brown I use it constantly I just
use a little elf duo brush I've been
using it for months and I really like it
we wanted to set my under eye really
quickly with my laura mercier secret
brightening powder I've had this a while
this is not a fall item but I do need to
set it with something because it keeps
settling for prom so I'm going to use my
number seven golden fan bronzer I didn't
buy a bronzer just time around but a lot
of you guys have asked
how it looks when you apply it so I'm
just using a smaller but fluffy brush
and it's not super pigmented I wouldn't
say but it's just right for me because I
don't like I don't need a sharp contour
I don't need anything like that I just
like to be a little bit bronzed a little
bit more defined and I just love the
tone of this bronzer for my skintone
they have a couple of shades this is
just the one I use golden sand so the
blush I'm using is a new one from
hourglass they've sent me these this is
these are their ambient strobe lighting
blushes and this is in brilliant nude
and these are just really really pretty
start your doing yardwork they have been
for hours it just might be perfect like
if you didn't have a bronzer with you
this is so beautiful so it can get
really heavy-handed like really heavy
innit
so I'm gonna go back in with my
foundation brush and I like to just kind
of buff these kinds of things into the
skin and make them look a little bit
more seamless I'm not a makeup artist
I'm not perfect not even cold like I
tell my students am I please you catch
my mistakes all the time you know I'm
not perfect no one is perfect
so I really like the shade of that so
much and those are so finely milled all
of their powers that bronzes are as well
so anyway I have two highlights to
choose from this first ones from model's
own and it's there
sculpting below highlighting powder and
peach pearl let me show you a swatch of
this this is the most beautiful
packaging beautiful kind of iridescent
purplish-pinkish peach color I've ever
seen isn't that beautiful
I also got this pure illuminating powder
and afterglow my best friend Laura love
this highlighter and she I always borrow
it when we're getting ready together I
always borrow it because I love it so I
finally bought it and it's this
beautiful golden tone highlight when you
apply it to your skin it looks
unbelievable I don't know how to
describe it and I've never found a
powder that looks as
so I want to use this you can see it but
the models own one I'll be comparing to
a high-end one that pretty sure they it
is a perfect dupe for but that is in a
future video I'm just using my ELF
highlighting brush to apply the pure one
so beautiful it's one of those
highlights that like never move
throughout the day it just stays in
place and looks as ridiculous as it does
when you apply it even at the end of the
day it's so glowy it's one of those ones
that like as summer I feel like this is
like the most ideal summertime highlight
look at that so I'm going to use this
NYX no filter finishing powder when I
bought it Alta previously not this trip
but I just like to use this powder to
kind of blend everything together even
the highlight it tells everything down
just a little bit as a little bit more
coverage I just love these kinds of
powder foundations where they're just so
beautiful they blend your bronzer and
blush everything kind of together a
little bit more just kind of steps
everything so for my eyes I'm going to
use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I don't
know I know Mac just started getting
sold at Ulta online so far not like in
stores near me yet
but that's really exciting because
anything you know Ulta points on a etc
well I don't know I know they're not
telling the entire Mac collection so I
think Paint Pots are on there I'm going
to check and I will put on the screen
right now but I love this one in soft
ochre I also like painterly but I'm a
little bit more partial to soft ochre
it's a little bit more yellow based for
me but I love this I've been using this
as an eye primer for a long long long
long time hold onto your shadow and it
kind of cancels out any veining or
discoloration you might have I am
drinking cold coffee and it's Cafe Du
Monde if you've ever had that it's from
New Orleans but they sell in some stores
near us so we always buy it and it's
kind of like our weekend special coffee
okay oh man I forgot I also just Nick
dose of do and it is this gorgeous if
they stick
but it is this beautiful iridescent
cream now I will put that on I forgot I
also have that isn't that gorgeous but
what I've done is I just stuck it like
right here and then just grab the brush
or a blender it looks best I think with
a beauty sponge but if you just you
could literally just put a stripe right
there and then use your beauty blender
to kind of blend it in and it's so
flawless it's not powdery because it's
not a powder this is gorgeous
I completely forgot that I bought this
this time around so beautiful so cheap
go buy go buy you will be so glad you
did all right
so I have two eyes shadow palettes that
I purchased there I bought the NYX
I bought the NYX perfect filter palette
and this one is the one that's called
all of you and I thought oh my gosh the
pans of these are so big this is so
beautifully pigmented I love the
combination of colors it's got matte
it's got shimmer so that was really
exciting now those do not come with a
brush I also bought the models own
barely-there palette look at the shades
of this just ignore the little dip I
accidentally my nail dug into one of
them it freaks me out them look at the
shade Brian Eno's lorac pro 3 and it
reminds me of one of the lorac unzipped
palette these shades and this are so
beautiful they have like six or eight
palettes I love the packaging they're so
cool
I have to admit guys i swatched them and
I was like they're alright I regret it
these are not great I've used this this
week I'll show you some swatches I love
the color combination but I have to
admit once I started watching it and
then I used it some of them are great
some of them are just okay it's kind of
a hit or miss the shimmer if you think
would be crazy pigmented and they're
just there so I use this I haven't tried
the NYX one so I want to try that one
with you guys right now this is just
okay it's still like almost $20 and they
were 40% off when I bought it and so I
was like well at least a lot cheaper
this way I almost bought two and I'm
really glad I didn't and it makes me so
sad because the colors are so beautiful
but like I said you can still get an
absolutely pretty look at it but the
shimmers are just not that great I think
the masts are better than the shimmers
so the NYX perfect
culture one let me show you some
swatches of this I think this is so much
more buttery so much more high-end and I
think these were right around the same
price and of course NYX you can always
get that these shimmers in this are
ridiculous they're so buttery the only
one I thought was kind of crummy was the
one that's like this light yellow shade
here it just literally didn't do
anything but the rest of them are so
ridiculous let's go ahead and apply some
of this I'm going to try and do it as
quickly as I can I like to use a fluffy
brush in like feet the like light shade
just all over my lid to kind of set it
all to set the primer that I put on and
to kind of even everything out so no one
shadow sticks to anything then I'm going
to grab a different brush and I'm going
to grab this matte kind of warm brown
shade and I'm going to put that in my
crease this is the perfect crease shade
and I'm letting it get a little bit onto
my lid as well it's so easy to blend I
was very surprised how far kind of
spreading itself out in a good way I'm
going up pretty close to the problem
with this I'll use that light shade at
the end to kind of illuminate my brow
bone but I'm letting it I've got a lot
of space there on the cuff fill it all
in so I'm going to use a thinner more
detailed brush and I'm going to get the
I don't know I'm going to try this green
shade here says one of the matte ones
and do it kind of more on the outer
corner and a little bit of the crease
you have a tiny bit of fallout but
frankly like I feel like one rock
shadows have way more fallout like this
is not bad at all I filmed a Dollar Tree
get ready with me today and I wiped it
all off just because I wanted to do
another one here
but I was pleasantly surprised by some
of the things but I was able to be
really sloppy with that because the
Chows weren't crazy pigmented but these
are way more things it's ready to be
more careful look I suppose so I'm going
to take this beautiful rose gold bronzy
color and put it on my lid this is so
thinking pretty oh my gosh
it looks exactly like the mask pigment
and tan and I love I think that one's
maybe a little bit more rosy gold rosy
bronze this is a little more of gold and
bronze I'm going to get just a tiny bit
more of that medium brown just to blend
the whole look a little bit more
together so for my lower lash line I'm
actually I bought this liner brush from
NYX and it's an angled liner brush I've
never used one like this but I wanted to
try it for my lower lash line and I'm
going to use that same dark green wow I
really like this dark green I'm going to
coat a little bit more of that here in
the outer corner so it blends into that
a little bit better so I'm going to take
a thinner smaller brush and I'm going to
get that nude shade again and just put
it right under my brow bone just to kind
of clean that area well really impress
with this palette now they had a couple
different versions of it now I want to
go back and get more because I'm very
very impressed felt like a very high-end
Powell Titan I'm really quickly with my
pixie I define waterline vog target and
I'm also going to use some gel liner I
always used as my L'Oreal blackest black
gel cream liner and love I use it every
single day
so the next one that I did just buy is a
new one from NYX
so let's new me it's their epic ink
liner and it has the brush tip I think
it supposed to be similar to Kat Von D
one which I prefer felted but this is
the best kind of a brush tip you could
possibly find cuz it's so similar to a
brush tip if that makes sense or it's
similar to a sultan so let's try oh it's
very black oh my gosh like feel like
this is blacker than the Kat Von D one I
might like this you guys know my
favorite is the Stila stay all day with
the liner I might like this more it was
so easy to apply the Wayne just happened
oh my gosh alright so it is time for
mascara I'm going to brush my lashes out
I am Anna from fake lashes because I'm
saying I'm filming some more today and
then we're going out tonight to our
families for Mother's Day I hate wearing
lashes and things like that but I might
just wear them anyway just because I
like wearing lashes for videos as much
as I can and I actually have the time to
put them on today but I'm using a
tweezer Minh curler and is amazing they
sent this to me a while ago and they
have won four different eye shapes so
actually you know depending on your eye
shape you can find one that works I
think mine was more for like round eyes
so you can actually get old lift your
lash band they have ones that are longer
similar like this should say oh one
that's really really long if you have
longer eyes but that was really
expensive I'm going to throw mascara
person I put on my superhero it
cosmetics mascara this stuff honestly I
don't even need lashes when I wear it
obviously lashes add more to anything
but when I wear this which is like every
day I get asked all the time if I'm
wearing fake lashes it's amazing and I
never get asked that it is just but I
don't know what in the world is in this
now the closest I found as a dupe is the
essence lash princess mascara which I
can link below as well it's like
literally a fourth of the price and it
is really really good I mean it's like
really close so those are my two
favorite mascaras but this one it still
Trump's it just a little bit it's just
the rarity curl this one remember
now for lips I'm going to use this NYX
epic ink lip dye I'm a little bit
nervous I've never used it before it's
in the shade revolt but my friend Laura
have one in a different color she loved
it so I was really excited to give it a
try so for this since it's inky on a
wipe off my lip balm really gently just
because I want to make sure it sticks
I'm nervous because I don't know if I
need to line my lips or not but I know I
swatch it on my hand the other day and
it did not come off for days so like
Jessica don't screw this up hahaha okay
so it's just a doe foot applicator very
thin
Wow I really like the color I did not
need to line my lips I don't know I
might put more than one layer on it does
not say I'm sure you can I'm gonna let
this dry and maybe from one more layer
but it's really pigmented really thin
you can still kind of fearless turret
not really though I don't really know
how to describe it it's just a very thin
formula and they had a pretty good
amount of shade actually I really like
this red though a little bit deeper now
that I put a second layer on so I
actually I'm going to go ahead I put all
my lashes I'm using 2l blue um you know
it's just like the standard everyone
loves this stuff blue I have no eyelash
Kanna swear I will say that but these
are just the Ardell little demi wispies
and it's just the value pack I love
these I trim them a little tiny bit so I
already have one pair of already worn
and I wear again I'm not a snob when it
comes to lashes at all but I do know I
really like the way these look when I
have them on so that is a win in my book
I usually just put a strip of blue like
on a makeup remover wipe so ironically
and I just dip the lash in the glue and
that's instead of trying to apply it to
the strip notice it's just a little bit
easier I can get a little bit more even
coverage so while the blue is driving
I'm gonna I bought a new Urban Decay all
nighter I usually use my skin Danai via
a setting spray that I love that they
make this as well
so I just bought it I saw it I was like
I'm almost out of that and they're
basically the same product oh the
nozzles on these are so amazing they
actually will on your makeup all day so
