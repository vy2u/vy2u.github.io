an Ulta haul I know what you're thinking
another haul yes I'm just in that mood
and there's so many like things out
there that like I just went to Ulta
after work and I was like I just feel
like shopping for makeup do you ever get
one of those moods so I was like
browsing and I'm like oh my gosh I want
to try this oh my gosh I wanna try this
and then I repurchase some things so
I've got so many things to show you
mostly makeup a little bit of skin care
let's go ahead and get into it so this
video is actually sponsored by derma e
and I was so excited to work with them
because this is a brand that I've loved
for a couple of years now and so when
they contacted me I was like oh my gosh
this is like one of my favorite breakups
oh my gosh they were like hey you want
to do a video to government yes yes yes
because I love them I don't think I've
tried a single derma e product that I
didn't love my husband's even used some
of their skincare and he loves it so two
of our favorite products are their
hydrating day cream I think they sent
this one to me but I think this is like
the third one I've owned it is such a
nice day cream especially in the winter
for me I have dry skin but it really
flares up in the winter I know I'm not
alone so for me this is the perfect
under makeup thing that's incredibly
hydrating I feel like it kind of
hydrates the skin throughout the day so
that way no matter what I'm putting on
my face if it's like a really drying
foundation it looks so much nicer and my
skin looks healthier all the way through
when I take it off at night so I love
this stuff and if I didn't mention derma
e is cruelty free which i think is just
really cool so another product that was
already a favor of mine is their vitamin
C intensive night cream I haven't had
this in a while and all of this is sold
at Ulta of course this is one of those
products that I feel like my skin drinks
it up at night again a favorite year
round but especially in the winter it
just drinks it up and it's like a nice
kind of it's a thicker cream but it's
like still almost gel like it's like a
gel cream more cream than Jo I can't
describe it I love it so much I feel
like I fly through it and this is
probably might even be the fourth one of
these I've owned isn't that crazy
I really really like it I feel like I
used to talk about them a lot a while
ago and I just haven't had any their
products recently like I've just been
trying other things
so excited to have these again now they
did send over a couple of other things
that are also sold one of them is a
collab with another youtuber I just
subscribe to her her name Sunkist Alba
and she's freaking gorgeous but she
collabed with them to make this this is
their radiant glow face oil and the way
they say to use it it says for a radiant
glow massage two to three drops onto
clean skin apply day or night as desired
she even mentioned because there was
like a little cute where did I go it's
over by my desk there was a cute little
pamphlet with it where she was
describing how she uses it she uses it
in her hair
you know flares like dry ends you can
kind of run it through the ends of your
hair to make it look less dry you could
put it on your body so I just thought it
looks so beautiful it does say to shake
well it's kind of got this like almost
like shimmer to it not glitter but a
nice shimmer let's just try it but if
you've been watching my like snapchat
slash Instagram story where I get ready
most mornings I've really been into
putting oil on my face in the morning
before foundation again for the extra
hydration and glow before I put a
foundation on especially in the winter
so I've really been into this so I was
actually really pumped to try this so it
definitely has a yellow tint but it just
kind of has a slight smell its pleasant
mm-hmm I can tell my skin's gonna love
it look at that
mmm just gonna drink it right up so I'm
really excited about that and that comes
with a ton of product like I think about
comparing this to like the Smashbox
primer oil
this has more skincare benefits than
that and it's probably gonna last me way
longer because it's two fluid ounces and
it's way cheaper so another product is
there overnight peel with a a chaise so
I have really gotten into alpha hydroxy
acid it has 5% AJ so it's basically well
read what it says and then I'll say what
I feel like it does it safely and
effectively removes dead surface skin
cells evens out the look of pigmentation
diminishes age spots and adds radiance
so for me I really do notice the
difference in like the pigmentation on
like my cheeks especially when I'm using
an aaj product 5% is I in my opinion
decently gentle kind of in my experience
so I feel like that's a nice
level for me and I love that it has a
pump for me I use this once or twice a
week I've used another one of their
peels I haven't used this one and I
really liked it
but I only used it twice a week no more
than that I mean the last term I eat
product is their radiance toner this has
glycolic acid again it's really good at
helping with your pores and again it's
kind of that acid based thing that's
really good at turning over your skin so
it says it's alcohol free it's a toner
helps tone tighten and brighten for a
soft smooth and luminous appearance
glycolic acid helps to remove dead skin
cells for younger looking skin and then
there's rooibos and rosehip help revive
skins so I am really excited this I have
not tried I think it must be one of
their new new products but I'm kind of
on the hunt for a great toner I feel
like I haven't found a toner that I'm
just in love with and so I'm hoping this
might be it I don't think I've tried a
glycolic acid toner so anyway really
pumped about these I will link all of
these below alright so let's continue on
into some make-up I did buy two backups
of my NYX there's so much guys in here
and I met some lovely subscribers by the
way at Ulta when I went and hi to Amy
and I didn't catch the other one I meant
that I think was a manager there but
they were so so sweet everyone there was
really sweet and I told them well you're
probably gonna be seeing me a lot cuz we
just recently moved here and I love
makeup so anyway it was just awesome so
was nice meeting you guys and Amy by the
way has a YouTube channel I will link
her it's below because she had me
subscribe and I thought that was awesome
good for you for saying hey will you
subscribe to my channel I thought what I
have been brave enough to ask someone
that like I met probably not and I
thought that was awesome so I want to
link her channel below so you guys can
check it out as well anyway so I ordered
two of the epic ink liners I can never
find these in other source other than
Ulta which is just bizarre I don't know
what hey I can always find them on
ulties website as well though so these
are it's the best liquid liner I've ever
used it's super waterproof I've used it
today of course this is makeup I put on
many many hours ago it's like what time
is it 6:30 now when I'm filming p.m. and
I got up and got ready at like 6 a.m. so
anyway I love this stuff so much better
than anything high-end I've ever tried
best liquid liner on that note though I
did get the Trey Jolie NYX gel liner is
cat the lien I almost had Kathleen D
like Kat Von D oh my gosh is it
kathleenlights that loves the Trey Jolie
liner
I remember hearing about it and I feel
like I can hear her saying it with her
like slight accent so cute
she said it's crazy crazy black and
crazy amazing so I'm sure excited to try
this by the way I always say this in
Hollis I will do a whole update with all
these products let you know like what
did I actually like what did I not cuz
obviously most of these I haven't tried
and I'm not necessarily putting it on
right now so I will do a haul update
letting you guys know how I liked
everything next thing I bought because
of Tati she had mentioned this Tarte
timeless smoothing primer and it was
like I think it was sold out on
sephora's website so I was like Ulta and
sure enough they had it so it's this
really nice jar with the gold lid anyway
so it's it's a very filling primer and
for me I think this would work best just
on my nose maybe a little bit farther
out but again I don't want it to enhance
dry skin that's what I'm a little
nervous about so I think I would only
use this mostly on my nose but I'm so
excited to try it because I think she
said this was like her like above all
the rest favorite and I thought holy
moly
she's probably tried 10 times what I've
tried which I feel like I've tried so
much so anyway so that is awesome and
I'm so excited to finally have this in
my possession
another thing I've heard of taken this
out of the packaging it's from
japonesque it's their contour and
highlight KU Midori Collection brush it
looked like these really expensive NARS
ones is it NARS that I've had my eyes on
they're in my like love's list and I
won't buy them because they're so
expensive and then I saw these and these
were still kind of expensive I want to
say this might have been on sale when I
bought it but I think it was still like
15 ish dollars but it literally looks
just like those so it's for contour
highlight whatever I probably use it
more for contour I have plenty of
highlight brushes and this is about the
size I like for kind of I don't really
true to your contour it's more of like a
bronzy contour you know I think that's
what most of us do Nami it's like normal
life anyway so I really am excited to
try this it looks really cool they had a
bunch more but I was like Jessica just
get one see if you even like it then
maybe go back and get more oh no oh no
we're all boys at home so I
speaking of tart let's stay on that vein
because I brought two more products I
feel like I used to be on their PR list
well okay let me just say this I
remember a few years ago they sent me
like all of their blushes and in a
declutter video or something I got rid
of all of them and it wasn't because the
blushes were bad that I just wasn't
using them and I kind of felt guilty and
and I always wonder like did they take
me off the pr list because of that I'm
like that's okay I mean it is what it is
and it could just be that maybe that was
just like a one shipment thing and then
I was never on up here you know what I
mean that's always something I wonder
too like when I hear other people talk
about that anyway regardless I feel like
I really haven't given tart enough love
when it comes to just trying more of
their stuff so I bought one of their
Amazonian clay highlighters I've never
tried these this I was watching them and
I fell in love with this one this one's
in the shade stunner they have one
called expose and it was really pretty
not to be confused with their blush
exposed but this one I liked even more
again these don't swatch like the most
amazing thing in fact this watch is just
you almost can't do it justice but yeah
it's not but I figure skin tone wise
this is just about right for me because
I like a highlighter that I like too
subtle ones but I also like ones that
look really nice and shimmery but they
don't look gold on my skin cuz my skin
really is so fair so excited again I'll
update you on how I feel about that one
I did buy a blush and for all I know
this could have been a blush I owned and
I did cluttered that's the nature of my
job and the fact that I declutter I mean
it just happens but this one's in the
shade risque and I was watching coffee
break with Danny do I haven't even
finished it it's a 15 minute long
declutter which I'm like that is heaven
to me and I love her so it's even more
heaven anyway she was talking about all
her Tarte blushes and I was like I like
that she anyway it reminded me of
exposed and I was comparing it to that
but it looks just a little bit more up
my alley oh my gosh isn't that so me
like it's so like boring and normal but
I love it so very very excited to own
this as well all right I also picked up
trying to like weed through this
here and have some semblance of
organization these pure eyelashes
Samantha March are clearly was inspired
by very much a lot of what find a lot of
youtubers um she talked about these pure
eyelashes and she loves the bombshell
ones they were sold out they're sold out
online all the time they were sold out
in store I'm like come on I just want to
try but I bought the other kind
socialite and diva these look really
pretty but from what I've heard about
these the band is like freaking perfect
it's not too thick where it's like
obviously fake I mean they're gonna look
obviously fake regardless but it's not
too thick of a band it really is easy to
use easy to put on now these were
freaking $14 and I knew that and I
thought Jessica you should only get one
but then I thought well then I don't
know which one I'm gonna lie and the
reality is I don't own a lot of lashes
because I don't wear them all the time
but I do wear them from time to time in
videos and things like that so I do like
having them and if these really aren't
that great and I can reuse them over and
over again then it's worth the money but
still I was like oh my gosh Jessica but
I'm excited to try them I bought this
Physicians Formula quad I remember
people talking about him pretty recently
but I hadn't seen them in like any
stores this is one of their new quads
and classic nudes and they kind of have
this kind of vintage II ish packaging I
was really just kind of curious about
whoa look at that shimmer just watching
these in a weird spot but that's alright
oh whoa there's a lot of powder fallout
though not that that can ruin it you
know I mean you can make it work ooh
these are really pretty though I'm gonna
try to swatch this dark brown with my
pinky okay so the mats are seem okay I
mean I'm not I haven't tried them on my
eyes
why did you swatch it there Jessica so
the shimmers are gorgeous like that
light gold is like whoa but it really
does kick up a lot so you've gotta tap
your brush off use a good primer those
kinds of things but I figured those look
like colors up my alley that I could do
a total look with so I'm excited I am
knocking everything over I got a couple
things from revolution
I got this matte blush and it's in the
shade beloved I'm excited to swatch this
I don't think they had one out to swatch
maybe they did I don't know I just love
makeup so much it's it's a really light
color but I thought oh that's up my
alley okay it is kind of powdery it's
hard to see because sorry my contacts
are drying out it's hard to see because
it's it really is a light pink but again
if you're my skin tone it's really nice
you can go crazy with your brush and it
still ends up looking like you know what
you're doing even if you don't so it has
the revolution kind of itched into the
pan their packaging really can be really
pretty I love that they usually have
like gold writing I know that's shallow
but whatever and they're a little bit
more affordable
I do think revolution can get up there
and well they're not as bad as like
models own which I'll talk about in a
second so the other revolution product I
picked up was their luxury baking powder
in ghosts I thought I'm pretty pale that
should um I really don't bake but I
thought I feel like I don't I don't know
I really don't have a stark white powder
maybe I would like baking if it I
probably won't but I figure this was a
more inexpensive thing and I'm just
curious how are their powders I have the
Jake at beauty ones that are like I mean
they're like in the exact same like I'm
talking exact same bottle packaging
whatever but anyway it's the Jake at
luxe Pro powder I really like the one in
porcelain actually a lot so I was just
kind of curious to try this pure white
one and if it's affordable that's pretty
awesome if it is good I also picked up
this model zone now model zone is one of
those brands that's newer to Sephora and
I just feel like they are charging way
more than they should considering that
most of the products have tried from
them I haven't loved there are some
decent quality there's their um one of
their highlighters I really liked was
actually really good but most of it just
kind of like meh but this caught my eye
this is the only thing I bought from
them because I've been so let down kind
of over and over again because it's
called there's it's called their
sculpting glow cream to powder bronzer
they had two shades this was the lighter
shade golden glow this sounds like it
might be like my
a really expensive Chanel tan Deschanel
that's what it's called so the way I use
these you're still seeing that shimmer I
am a literal mess today oh my gosh it
reminds me of the tan a Chanel it's kind
of a similar color let me swatch it next
to it this is definitely creamier than
this this is what it looks like it's
ridiculously expensive
well maybe not necessarily creamier okay
they are a different tone
now the darker one of this might be
maybe closer to that regardless I'm
excited to try and see could it be kind
of a formula dupe for it because the way
I apply this if you're intimidated by it
don't be I just grab a beauty wet Beauty
Blender maybe the one I already used
that day and I just kind of dip it in
here and I just kind of tap it in those
regions and it ends up looking so kind
of natural it doesn't add more powder to
your face again especially in the winter
so if this is a cheap alternative that
would be amazing I say cheap lightly
because I think it was still like $15 I
bought a palette and this is a palette I
feel like no one's talking about and I
don't know why it's not new anymore but
it's the Stila eyes are the window soul
palette so I'm just leaving eyes are the
window to the soul
I was for watching this one and they're
like metal and maps or whatever it was
called did I get the right one oh no no
I got the right one right I'm gonna be
honest I had seen this packaging is not
as cute as what I saw the one I was
watching had like the cute like who's
cuter that it matters giant mirror but
look at the colors I thought these are
so at my alley and I liked that I had a
little bit of cooler tones in it too I
have so many warm toned palettes and
it's funny because I've only recently
gotten into more warmer tones I really
used to be partial to cooler tones so I
am kind of excited to have this I used
to have the Sela in the light palette
and I loved it and finally I was like
okay it's getting pretty old
I finally decluttered it and I kind of
missed it because I did like the Stila
formula so their shimmers are gorgeous
is that kitten yeah so there's kitten in
it which is like their moe
famous shadow of like all-time strength
Matt and I remembered they blended
pretty well you know that one's alright
but like I said that shimmers are just
so really really pretty I'm excited to
try it again I'll let you know because
see you I feel like they get it I was
gonna say I guess they do get some lovin
but I think their palates are always
overlooked and they're really nice
usually it's just there I don't know
they for whatever reason don't get super
hyped up but I am excited to give them
some love and try that out okay you
can't make fun of me for this purchase
and I'm thinking about returnees let me
just cuz that was a dumb purchase but I
was just on that like shopping high and
this is the Clarisonic drying stand as
I'm saying as it's coming out of my
mouth I realized it was a dumb purchase
the idea is that you can put your
Clarisonic on it and it dries better and
hit charges Tigers gonna kill me when I
show him one that I bought this oh my
gosh she's gonna be like dude what are
you serious it was $25 Jessica well how
does it charge I don't get it ah okay so
I thought this charged it it doesn't so
you play you can place it on there and
the brush can kind of face down drawing
like this just so like after I've washed
my face I can set my Clarisonic down
like this to dry and then when I want to
charge it I can turn it up this way and
the charger which is like this big and
just like magnetizes to this part of it
can just sit on top of it I don't know
should I keep it I kind of love it cuz
I'm like oh it's so perfect but then at
the same time I'm like Jessica are you
freaking serious did you seriously spend
$25 for a stand to dry something oh my
gosh I finally bought it the Clinique
pop matte lip color in shade number one
blushing pop this is one that's been on
my freaking loves list wishlist forever
I've heard this formula is amazing oh my
gosh
that is really nice but I thought this
color is so pretty doesn't really have a
smell I really have not tried a lot of
Clinique's
I felt like Jessica you know you want
this you've seen it on people and it
looks unbelievable
in person too so I was really excited to
own that I repurchase finally my 8
Cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination powder foundation I hate
the name I mean it's fun but it's like
not fun to say over and over again and I
talk about this all the time
oh I've missed it so much so it's this
really pretty what white kind of
iridescent packaging I have it in the
shade fair it is the best powder
foundation I've ever ever used ever I
almost don't even want to swatch it I'm
so glad to have a new one it's just like
it's got crazy coverage but it just
makes your skin it doesn't make your
skin look dry there's no shimmer or
glitter that's what's funny that it has
illumination in the title cuz it's not
but it does give your skin this light
glow that just looks mattified and
healthy it's the weirdest thing I've
know I've not found another powder
that's quite like this so it's worth the
price tag because it's so so good okay I
also want some hair products just
because I'm a nerd um I needed okay does
anyone else raise your hand if you get
headaches when you have your hair up
like of course I've got my hair thrown
up because it was a mess today at work
and I'm like Jess could just put it up
and let it go let it go um but my head
always hurts now I've tried the new like
trendy um what are they called they kind
of look like telephone wire you know and
you put them in your hair right they
sent me a bunch of those and they were
alright I obviously tried all kinds of
other hair ties then I saw these now
they're not quite a scrunchie but
they're basic that they're called fit
girl Club and they're like they just
feel like a stretchy fabric that's it
and there's four of them and I thought
that could be the answer my prayers like
literally the answer to my prayers so I
thought this is perfect I'm gonna give
them a try I will let you know if they
don't give me a headache
it might be the answer and I also got
another headband just for like when I
get ready in the mornings especially
like I said I do it on snapchat
Instagram a lot I like having a headband
to hold my hair about but I usually like
them to go all the way around and
you have one that already has a bow like
this it's pink but I'm like well I like
to wash them so I bought this one it's
black and has like little gold metallic
threading throughout it's just kind of
cute so just for fun so those were all
of the products that I picked up from
Ulta this time thanks to derma e for
sponsoring this video if you are

mentioned I will link everything below
