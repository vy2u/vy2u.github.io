a haul update I feel like I'm turning
out haul updates a lot because I had a
lot of hauls in November December
January and so I'm trying to slow down
on the actual hauls please you and I
both know that's not gonna happen
but I'm trying to make sure that I
really am giving you guys that
follow-through that I keep saying that I
want to so this is a haul update when I
it's actually a really big haul from
Ulta on December 1st of last year so a
couple months if I've been trying these
for a few months and I always tell you
you know hauls are awesome I love
watching them but they're better when
they're coupled with some kind of an
update later so I can tell you that ok
now that I've used them here are the
deeds here the dirty deeds so I it was
cool because as I pulled that video up
and I was looking at the products I
talked about I'm pulling them out of my
collection I'm like oh my gosh like
there are so many products I absolutely
adore and then there are a couple that
I'm like you know I really didn't like
it so I'm so excited to share these with
you let's go ahead and get into it first
thing you can laugh I laughed at myself
and I thought about returning it but
it's this Clarisonic drying stand I
actually love it like I love it so much
and I didn't start using it until maybe
a month ago I just kept it in the box so
maybe I'll return it well I finally
started using my Clarisonic even more
regularly and I'm no it's not sponsor or
nothing like that and it just fits so
perfectly and it just sits so well in my
little area in my bathroom that I have
all my skincare amusing I love it I love
it so much it's the dumbest you know it
was like 25 bucks like really just kids
you really need well I'm obsessed with
it and I am so glad I bought it and it's
I was when I saw that this was this
video I'm like yes I get to talk about
that stupid drying stand that I actually
love so much it's just one of those
things that it's so satisfying learnt
and done to just go and it fits so well
and I know it's drying and I love it
you're wondering what's on my lips by
the way I get asked all the time and I
always forget I'm wearing the dose of
colors liquid lip and stone and then I
topped it with the NYX lip gloss in
beige which I think they're not selling
these mega shine lip glosses anymore
like I tried to link it the other day
what I love it so much but anyway any
any kind of pinkish lip gloss would give
the same look on top alright next thing
that I became totally obsessed with was
the models own sculpting glow this is
like a cream bronzer and it reminded me
so much when I was first buying it of
the Chanel so late and a Chanel where
it's kind of a cream to powder if you
will you can apply it with a sponge and
I've done that but it works really well
with my Clarisonic foundation brush
that's what I'm saying this is not
sponsored by them
I know it's sounding like fizz because
if I were watching this video and
someone mentioned Clarisonic two
different times in the first two
products I'd be like umm but anyway I am
just like on a kick I don't know and so
I use my foundation brush and I'll dip
it in here and put it on like here and
up there I love it I really really love
it now this is in the shade golden glow
I love this sleek packaging it's really
reap writi it's really really cheap so
much cheaper than the Chanel one and
they really give the exact same effect
on the skin do I think the Chanel one
lasts a little bit longer on the skin
yes do I think either one of them last
that long no because there's still that
kind of cream product that if you're
touching your face it's gonna slowly
wear off now you could set it with
powders I know a lot of people and I've
done this too will put a bronzer or
contour powder on top of one of these
cream products of course that's gonna
make it last really really long now for
me I don't wear bronzer every single day
so it's not sorry I'm grabbing my little
washcloth here so it's not something
that I feel like I have to do every
single day but I really really like this
and I do feel like this kind of a
product just looks a little bit more
natural on your skin than say a powder
because it's not gonna catch the light
in weird ways and I don't know I've
really I'm onna cream bronzer kick and I
never ever would have thought I would
have been cuz it used to intimidate me
but I really like it but if you know of
the Clarisonic foundation brush thing
just grab a boy's sponge and dip it in
there and kind of Pat it on and it looks
gorgeous
so that was an awesome drugstore find
another one is the revolution
the matte blush and it's in the shade
beloved this might be too light for my
skin like it's almost like neon it's so
light I don't know how else to explain
that and so the few times I've worn it I
it's okay
I think I would like this formula I just
need a different shades so again I like
the packaging I like the rose gold I
like the price point and I felt like it
wore really well throughout the day but
I just think the shade even though
looking at it I was like Oh that'd be
perfect for my skin tone I just don't
think it was so if you have a shade in
this line that you really like please
let me know below because I'm interested
to try another one and see how I feel
about him okay a dud okay not a dud a
struggle this was a this was a Jessie
struggle these are the pure lashes I
don't remember in that video which ones
I had bought I think it was these two in
diva and socialite and I wanted
bombshell while some lovely subscribers
sent me this into my peel box the
bombshell ones because they had them and
they were like I'm not you know they're
brand new I don't think I'm gonna use
them I got him in Egyptian box like that
it's awesome
well I've tried all of them they all
look crazy on me okay does anyone else
like I don't have I guess wrong eyes and
so like with most lashes I have to trim
them no big deal you know trim up come
on but there's something about the bands
of these that they look crazy on me like
I they look crazy on me now the only
ones that I felt were like they looked
decent on me were the ones in diva cuz
they're a little bit
I don't know less intense maybe but the
people that love these and wear them and
I'll see them they look gorgeous on them
they are like like it literally looks
like I can't like open my eyes like it's
so heavy I'm like you know what I think
it's like that Muppet who's the Muppet
I'll put her picture up here the one
that's like what's up man
and her lashes are like really really
thick that's what I feel like what I
tried these on I literally I think I
wore I don't think I've even worn them
in a video
they looked that bad on me but I know
the people that have those kind of
longer more just eyes that are more
fitted to big ol luscious lashes you'd
probably love these they just didn't
work for me I'm so
Khoosat and these are expensive next
product that blew me away was this
physician's formula I shadow quad and
classic nudes it was these shimmers that
blew me away now they kick up a lot of
like weird powder but holy moly they are
really really really pretty
shadows to be honest I don't feel like
I've gotten tons of use out of this just
because I have so many palettes that
have these same shades but if you didn't
or you were just wanting something
travel friendly or you just needed a new
quad maybe you're not into big palettes
or maybe you're just starting your
collection whatever really really
impressive now the mats are really nice
too they blended really well these
colors go really well together the
mattes don't swatch as well as the
shimmers those shimmers are crazy but
you'll see what I mean if you ever
swatch these shimmers that they're
almost chunky but not in a like glitter
fallout chunky way just more of a you
just want to make sure you're using a
good primer with them because you might
have a little fallout but they're so
almost creamy like creamy shadows so I
was really really impressed with this
and I was kind of prepared to not like
it and I really really liked it I had a
couple repurchases so like the it
cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination got stuffing on it it's
already so dirty I use this every single
day I used it today I pair it with
foundation sigh pair it with BB Creams
it's got so much coverage and yet it
looks just a little bit glowy but not
shimmery and it's it's my favorite
powder foundation of all all time I
really do use it every single day I love
it
so again if I ran out of again I would
buy it again and another repurchase was
my NYX epic ink liquid liner my favorite
liquid liner of all time I used it today
for like my mini winged he said every
day it's a brush tip not a felt tip and
I used to be really into felt tips but
this one just changed the game for me
and then when I first tried this I was
like and I'm sold it's super black stays
on all day super inexpensive doesn't dry
out very quickly it's amazing um but on
that same NYX vein this is the NYX Trey
Jolie liner in very black I just
couldn't I just felt like I would have
to go over it a couple times and it was
skip certain areas I'm like and
sometimes when a liner is a little bit
more waxy it does that where you know
you're trying to do a quick line and if
you're like me you're freaking pulling
because I just can't get it on otherwise
especially with this because it just
skips little areas and so that I'm like
okay trying to color it in and finally
it'll be colored in and while I don't
think that effects like the wear time
and the look in the end it is a little
bit of trial and error when you're first
using it so I'm obviously gonna continue
to use that I would use it up to I think
I'll buy it again
probably not I like the Milani one
better I can link that below if you're
just wanting you know again an
affordable option as well but it's just
better but it's not terrible just not my
favorite eyeliner I've ever tried and I
have heard they may be reformulated it
and that's why it's coming here I don't
know alright next was this um kuma Dori
because what was brush from japonesque
it's pretty good I've already cleaned it
it did a really good job you know like
it didn't shed it didn't dry weird I was
a little concerned though cleaning it
because the handle is kind of like a
almost feels like a wicker kind of
wrapped around it and so I was like is
that gonna dry all the way out like I
hope it does you know what I mean I
didn't want to ruin it so that was kind
of something to think about so I don't
know that I would buy a bunch from this
line if they all have the same kind of
nails just because I'd be scared that
they would get weird after a lot of
washes but it washed really really well
I have used it for bronzer a little bit
I think I like it best for that you
could use it for blush you could it
might be a little big be a be a little
bit big for highlighter but I did like
it it's soft is that the softest brush
I've ever tried no but is it totally the
same shape is that NARS brush that looks
just like this yeah so feel like you'd
get the same effect now this still
wasn't super cheap I still want to say
this around 20 bucks but I like it do I
think I would buy more from the line I
don't feel like I need to you know feel
like Real Techniques brushes are even
better than that and they're certainly
well some of them are cheaper some of
the Real Techniques brushes though are
kind of getting up there I'm like you're
defeating the purpose of your original
mission I'm saying that I don't even
know what their original mission was but
I feel like when I first heard of Real
Techniques I'm like oh it's other
youtubers and they're affordable but now
they've got like a more expensive line
stuff okay so I had a Clinique lipstick
this is their pop matte lip color and
zero one blushing pop very very creamy I
like it
it's it's definitely matte and yet it's
somewhat comfortable and that's why I
was originally drawn to it
I've probably worn it maybe four or five
times and I liked it
do I have to reapply it after a while of
course it's still a lipstick it's not
like a crazy dry down liquid lip but I
would prefer if I'm wanting a matte look
I think I'd prefer something like this
than a liquid lip of course I'm saying
that and I'm wearing a liquid lip with
lip gloss on topic anyway um I really
did like this would I buy other shades
sure if they were on sale when I paid
full price maybe for not maybe I don't
know but I really I really did like the
formula and actually the lipstick this
is full-size but it's so like small it's
very petite if you will so my last few
products were from Tarte this was one
the Tarte clean slate timeless primer
I've heard something this is a love-hate
very polarizing kind of a product some
people absolutely adore this they'll
kind of press it into their nose for me
I've tried it many different ways I
still can't get it to work um I'm not
gonna give up I'm not gonna give up on
it because hey this is way too expensive
to give up on but package it's got
frosted glass and gold linen like why is
it so pretty if by the way if you
haven't seen my video of products I
bought purely because of the packaging
and then my reviews on them I'll link
that video below I had so much fun
filming that this coat totally could
have been added to the list cuz I was
like I want it because it's a package
but I want to continue to try it if you
know any tricks with this Way's you've
used it that it really works for you
please let me know I just felt like for
me like it would just like it my makeup
never looked good on top of it and I
would only focus it where I kind of
needed that pore filling and it still
just never sat right on it but two
amazing crotch from Tarte I got another
of their blushes their 12-hour blush and
risque this might be my favorite shape
it looks a lot when I course I'm not
wearing today but it looks a lot like
this when you wear it this is not a
blush that swatch is super well none of
the Amazonian clay ones do but they're
very long wearing they're just easy to
apply if you get a Shea
that's great for your skin tone and they
have quite a range I've owned a lot of
these over the years and I've
decluttered a lot of them just because
the shades just weren't right for me and
I didn't feel right keeping them if I
wasn't using them but risque is like the
perfect shade if you're near my skin
tone and then I also for the first time
but one of their Tarte Amazonian clay
highlighters this one's in stunner I had
given it hard pan because I rubbed my
finger right across it when I first
bought it so I what I did is I just kind
of grabbed some tweezers I don't know if
you can see that swatch I grab some
tweezers and kind of lightly scrape the
top off you could also use like a brows
Foley is really good at getting that top
layer off without getting rid of too
much because with tweezers you have to
be very careful so it worked but it's
already starting to get some more hard
pants on like man it's just one of those
products that drives me crazy but it's
so good so it's like fine it's worth
scraping off every time but it still
kind of makes me mad but it's so good I
mean obviously I'm using this with a
brush but even with the brush I feel
like it's starting to get hard P and
randomly I'm like what so it's gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous this smells like
vanilla and I don't know why it smells
like vanilla but I freaking love it so
just I was very impressed became one of
my favorite highlighters very quickly
also the Stila ice or the window shadow
palette in insole that's like the the
version of the palette I have not used
this very much and I can't decide if
it's be the the quality is there they're
really especially the shimmers I think
the shimmers are better than the mattes
but I just don't feel inspired by it and
I'm saddened by that because I feel like
these are totally shadows that like old
Jesse would have loved because they're
not warm toned it took me a while to get
into warm tone shadows they're a little
bit more cool tone although there's
certainly some warm tones in here but
the shimmers are so beautiful Cielo does
shimmer shadows so well but I just
haven't reached for it and it's because
every time I open it I'm like yeah like
I just don't feel inspired so I think
it's a good palette and if you look at
these and you think oh my gosh those are
totally at my alley then you might love
it because it's a great palette I just
I need to like force myself to use it
more to fall in love with it because I
just haven't fallen in love with it yet
does that make sense
so those are all of the products from
that haul oh the only ones they didn't
mention where the skincare products at
the beginning the derma e ones because I
talk about those I've already used most
of those I had already start over just I
already used most of those in the past
anyway I already love them so I didn't
feel like it was worth bringing up again
and some of them I think I've already
used up and they're like gone just like
barreled through it so I still love
those products I loved your me products
but I didn't feel like I needed to talk
about him again cuz I talked about him a
lot in that video so I hope you enjoyed
I hope you'll subscribe if you did and I
will see you guys in my next one
