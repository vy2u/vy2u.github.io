an Ulta haul but today I'm gonna do it
kind of Tryon style and this is more of
a haul review cuz I have been trying
these for a few weeks so I'll be able to
kind of give you my opinion on them
already and show you what they look like
when you apply them so if you follow me
on snapchat you've seen me use some of
these some of them I try to keep some
things hush-hush so it's like you're not
feeling like you're always seeing the
exact same products if you also watch me
get ready on snapchat so anywho Zoll
let's go ahead and get into it I'm
feeling like kind of in a bad mood today
and I'm hoping that filming puts me in a
good mood like I'm just Moody just Moody
but if you're wondering what's on my
lips it's the NARS Velvet Matte lip
pencil and let's go crazy this I got in
my Sephora play unboxing or box I should
say I just put up a little while ago and
I just really liked it in this formula
it's really thin so it I don't know like
it's just comfortable and it's not it's
more like a lipstick than it is like a
matte you know lipstick kind of a thing
I don't know how else to describe it but
it definitely is matte it's it's nice
it's nice I have a lot of makeup I've
got a couple palettes some concealers
some liner some primer some foundation
some body care I've got a lot of stuff
so oh and a mascara so let's go ahead
and get into it did I already say that
I'm sorry okay so let's start with
what's on my eyes today this is what put
me in a bad mood and I've been using
this for a few weeks
it's the dose of colors marvellous moths
shadow palette this has 5 eyeshadows in
it they're all matte they're all that
kind of mafia pinky tone and you know
fades from light to dark great concept I
love how sleek it is they've got a
couple of these here's the thing I don't
know why this put me in such a bad mood
I felt like I couldn't get my outer
corners even so then I was getting mad
so then I was applying more of lighter
colors and that wasn't even blending in
at all so then I pack on more of the
dark colors and that really it still
wasn't even so I don't think it's a
Sarah
fault of the palate I think it's just
user error I'm a dingdong and I am I I'm
used to my comfort zone of palates and
colors and this like kind of pinkish
purple is just a little bit outside of
my comfort zone so I don't know it's
just taking trial and error but other
days when I didn't dip into the darker
colors like these lighter colors I
really did like so I use pretty much
every single color for this I look today
and I use the darker one on my lower
lashline as well so I like it the
formula is good enough that it intrigues
me to buy maybe one more of their like
little sets they have maybe they have
like two other ones so I would be
willing to try maybe one more of these
maybe one that's you know like if I get
one that's more Browns I might be a
little more comfortable you guys know
what I mean
sometimes I feel like when I put pinks
and purples on my eyes it can make me
look even more tired and just I don't
know like that's like seeing myself in
the viewfinder I'm like I just don't
think I like it
I think lashes help you know what I mean
like little things like that can help it
but I just don't think on my skin tone I
don't know it's just my own opinion I
hope it looks okay I mean that's really
what I'm trying to say I guess but so I
liked it if you know this color scheme
is up your alley go for it if it's not I
would say maybe try one of the other
ones cuz I do think the form of these is
great I repurchase my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer I forgot about how good this
stuff is and you know with all of the
height between behind so many concealers
right now I feel like concealers really
big well it's probably always been big
but every company is trying to come out
with an amazing concealer which is
fantastic because it's something I use
every single day every single day so in
all that shuffle I had forgotten about
this so I repurchased it I have in the
shade NW 15 and it works really well I
think that was the shade I had last time
but it's got a little tiny pump and what
I'll do is all just a while usually I'll
just pump it onto my fingers and tap it
there and then use a sponge to blend it
in it's it's it settles and decreases as
much as any other concealer does but
this is so
right now and I do feel like it tends to
mesh really well with other foundations
and lately as I'm trying more and more
concealers I'm really realizing that
some of them as I'm blending them in
when we're they kind of meet the
foundation this area can look really
weird and textured but this does not do
that and I really appreciate that and
this is something you know you can use
this anywhere on your face like anything
then I just like it I feel like it stays
on really well and I'm really glad to
have it again in my collection this
however I'm not wearing today the
concealer I'm wearing today well first I
started with the benefit buying
brightening concealer I got in the shade
number one this was supposed to be
replacing erase paste this is not erase
paste erase paste was much thicker
almost not goopy but it's the same tone
but it is not erase paste that's okay
but array space was really good cuz it's
this salmon color at cancelling out like
purple blue tones so I would always use
it like right here and I haven't had it
in years and so I was like well let me
just try this the packaging is super
cute it is really kind of like
lightweight it feels kind of cheap but
it's still cute I don't know but what I
did is I applied it just on my inner
corners and I do think it brightens the
area and it cancels out some of the blue
I just tapped it in with my fingers on
one side and a sponge on the other and I
do think it works best with fingers now
what I want to put this all over no I've
tried it a couple times that way and
it's just a little bit too amoliant to
stick and stay and so for that reason I
tried the other concealer i also bought
which is the Catrice liquid camouflage
that so many people are raving about I
was so excited to try it and I was very
very very impressed so I bought it in
the shade ten porcelain and it's just a
doe foot and I just kind of applied it
right under my eye like normal use the
sponge to blend it out and this stuff
has surprising coverage surprising
coverage it does settle into fine lines
but not as bad as a lot of other ones so
for that reason I
reached for it a lot over the past two
weeks that's about when I started using
this one and I just I really like it it
looks really really nice
now comparing the Catrice to the Mac I
think they're very similar coverage wise
I do think the Mac one again meshes
better with foundation I do think the
Catrice one can sometimes give like
weird areas but not enough that I
wouldn't recommend it and not enough
that I'm not wanting to use it because I
still really really like it so
definitely would recommend especially
for the price point one of the best I
found at the drugstore easily let's talk
about this product that I love but boy
this is gonna take some learning it's a
learning curve this is the tarte tardes
Pro lash adhesive I was not aware that
it was black that this glue is black
what a great idea because if you're you
know wanting that dark line right at
your lashes which if you're using fake
lashes you probably do it's you know
it's darker so you don't feel like you
have to go over it with like another
liner on top after the glue is dried
well when I was putting this slash on
today I didn't rise at this so this
truly was the first time I was using it
because I don't wear fake lashes every
day I'm just wearing them when I film
anyway so I'm gonna swatch it if you
will it is black but what I loved is
that I could just hold onto the lash
brush this on and I know there are other
brands that make brush on adhesive but
once I put it on the problem I found and
this is where I say this is gonna be a
learning curve kind of a product the
problem I found was it's great that it's
black but you have to be careful I had
like a couple sputters of black like
right up on my lid so I had to remove
all that eye shadow put the eyeshadow
back on it's still if you could see me
really really close you can still see it
and not only that but once I actually
got it on there and set some of the glue
would get up into because it's so
liquidy I don't know how else to explain
it I've not experienced this with a lash
clue yet that it would get up and up in
the lashes and they were all stuck
together so I was trying to hold the
lashes on and brush through them
that was difficult so by the time I got
to
/ I was a little bit better at it and I
knew I I need to wait a little bit
longer because it takes just a little
bit longer to get tacky and then I set
it right on and it did a great job one
thing I do like about this and it's a
little dangerous you have to be careful
because if you reheat the side of the
bottle that says avoid contact with eyes
I'm like ah I think it's like right by
your eye but while trying to avoid
contact with the eye and I did
successfully do this one of the corners
had come up so I was able to just kind
of brush this on like liquid liner and
then just hold the lash down for 30
seconds and it stuck so it certainly
makes it easy to apply I did end up
going back over it with liquid liner
just to get it all even but it
definitely was black there was no weird
whiteness showing through like some
glues will do and that alone was pretty
cool so I do like it if you're in need
of one and you like the idea of a brush
I would say it is worth the money I
could see myself as I get better at this
buying this again so another product I
bought is the NYX hydro touch oil primer
now this I'm actually testing today as a
dupe for well I'm not testing it I
showed it on camera so I'll show you me
applying it to half of my face cuz I was
doing the dupe on the other side but
this is in my opinion absolutely a great
dupe for the Smashbox primer oil much
much cheaper guys it is the exact same
effect it is the exact same effect now I
don't view primer oils like this so much
as like skincare so while I would
believe that some of the ingredients
might be different I haven't looked
but the ingredients might be different
because the Smashbox one is more
expensive but I'm using this more just
for the moisture effect and the look
that it gives unless so for skincare
purposes does that make sense so if I
were to dig deeper and see I wouldn't be
surprised if there were like different
ingredients and maybe NYX is using
cheaper ones I could also see them
having the exact same ingredients and
Smashbox charging more because their
name-brand you know what I mean well so
is next but you guys know what I mean a
more expensive brand regardless I was
very impressed with this so if you've
been dying to try like the Smashbox one
don't go for the NYX it's the same thing
absolutely the same thing I could have
blindfolded put these on and had no idea
which one was which
if you're curious not that you can like
see
but this side of my face is what has the
nicks primer oil and this side has the
Smashbox and I'm sure you cannot tell a
difference of course it's underneath
foundation and powder
speaking of foundation what I'm wearing
today is the new at cosmetics a bye-bye
foundation full coverage moisturizer
when I saw this I was like what because
the it cosmetics CC cream is basically
like a full coverage moisturizer I have
realized these are a little bit
different in my opinion their difference
is that this has slightly less coverage
I do think the CC cream has more
coverage but other than that I mean the
packaging is virtually exactly the same
when I saw this I thought they were
discontinuing the CC cream and renaming
it and I was really nervous and like oh
no did they tweak the formula please
don't touch the formula the CC cream is
like the is perfect the way it is they
just need tons more shade same for this
but I do like this so today I applied it
in half with my hands and half with the
sponge I think you can go either way
with this I think you do get a little
more coverage with your hands but what I
would find myself doing is I would still
even on like days where I did my whole
face with my hands I would still grab a
sponge and kind of blend certain areas
you know like I get weird right around
here and around my nose here's the thing
this is not something I can leave
without setting it looks very not greasy
but I mean it looks like a moisturizer
on which is an awesome idea and I would
much rather look oily and dewy then dry
and scaly I would I feel like most
people would say that I don't know some
people love like that matte look though
and I I know I don't anyway this I feel
like I do like but I don't know if I
love it enough that I would repurchase
it also this shade well I guess it
worked as you say I feel like every time
I look I'm like it's a little dark but
for something that's just a full
coverage moisturizer I don't feel like I
want to be like well let me add a custom
cover drops and make sure it's the right
shade I mean I will and I have but I
guess what I'm saying is if it's
supposed to be really low maintenance I
want to find a shade that's perfect I
feel like this is fine though I'm
getting off on a ramp if you are someone
that you want something similar to
attention moisture
are really really easy but that has a
lot more coverage this is totally going
to be your jam because it's easy to
apply it blends in quickly and it
definitely has more coverage than
attention moisturizer now a few problems
owns like for me it's my nose when I
would look at it afterwards I'm like oh
my gosh you can see all the redness
peeping through but the rest of my face
for the most part was fine so you know
take it with a grain of salt so for me I
just ended up taking my nose and putting
powder foundation on it and that covered
it and I was done so I do like it I
still like the CC cream better next
product I bought and have been trying
out is the essence cushion liner this is
something that I actually showed in
another life trying new makeup video
this is literally a cushion filled with
liquid liner so it's not a gel or cream
liner however you can use it with like
for me I have a very specific Mac brush
the Mac 263 all Lincoln that I love to
use with liquid liner or with gel liner
so when I dip it in this I can still get
that precision I like with it but it's
really quick to apply because it's a
liquid so it's just so that's what I use
today and I I'm very impressed I'm
curious to see how quickly this dries
out I think I said that in the last
video too but regardless I really really
like it I've really been enjoying using
it because it's quick the mascara I'm
wearing and of course I put on lashes
but you can see the mascara in my like
kind of try on that I'll show you here
in a sec this is the NYX worth the
height mascara this actually came free
with my order it was something I was
some promotion they were doing it was
just full full-size free it's pretty
impressed with this this it lengthens it
curls it darkens it has some volume this
is something that I felt comfortable
wearing on its own like a lot of times
I'll mix mascaras or whatever and of
course like I said I put on lashes today
because I'm filming a bunch but this is
beautiful on its own it really is it
reminds me of like the L'Oreal
voluminous mascara mixed with the lash
paradise it's like if you mix those two
you'd get this because they like the
Gloria voluminous
I do think is really volumizing and
really black lash paradise I think has
it all and this one's kind of
somewhere in between and so I do like it
I could see myself I mean I will
definitely use this up another product I
got is from Tarte it's their make magic
happen palette this was a huge letdown
I was looking at the colors online and I
thought oh yeah
those are like totally up my alley I
would use every single one of these
colors and I thought it was cool I like
how the shadows are really close to each
other it doesn't really waste any space
it's got a big mirror really compact
cute well it's got some matte shadows
that are kind of almost satin matte but
these two these are they're cheap
I don't even know how to like it's okay
I put a little bit of like one of the
champagne shimmers on my eyes and even
the shimmers are almost matte like they
almost look like satin so I don't know
like I feel like it's okay it's not like
so bad that I would say don't ever buy
it even if it's on clearance well but
kind of though now that I'm saying that
out loud because the reality is the five
times I've used this to try to do a look
it looked the same no matter what even
if I would use the dark colors I would
not use the dark colors it would all
blend away nothing was super shimmery
nothing was super matte it was just like
a weird wash of color no matter what I
was using it is the craziest thing if he
was you if you have used this comment
below with your experience because it's
just odd and so while I do think like
the wash of color would look kind of
pretty it was always the same so
Michaels and I don't need a whole
palette I just need like one or two
shadows that you know and so for me I'm
like you know this is still expensive
I regret it I regret it so I don't know
like I literally look at this and I'm
like you feel that like in the pity or
somebody can think oh and you want to
use it but you're like I don't though
because I know exactly what's gonna look
like I don't know
so let me know if you love to this like
I guess I can apply the shadows wet but
these even the shimmers like I said
aren't like that punchy shimmer so this
would be ideal I guess for the girl or
guy who
likes just like a very neutral simple
look every single time otherwise I just
don't think you need it I really I have
one more make up item and then I have
two body products I'm really excited
tell you about their drugstore ones and
I fallen head over heels so firstly
though the NYX total control control
drops I've been trying I tried this a
couple ways and my favorite way to use
it for my skin type which is normal to
dry is mix them at the foundation I have
noticed I've tried to compare it to like
my cover FX custom cover drops and while
I know that this is meant to be more of
a standalone foundation it totally works
as like a foundation shade changer
however it does because it is more of a
foundation formula it does adjust the
look not just the color but the actual
finished look of any foundation you mix
it with so I tried it mixed with like
moisturizer and I that's okay it kind of
ends up looking kind of like a tinted
moisturizer ish and I've also tried it
alone and I didn't like it alone I'm not
a big fan of really liquidy foundation
so for myself
I'm not sure why they always end up like
illuminating every dry patch under the
Sun for me but I know a lot of people do
like that kind of a thing so I would
recommend it as a really inexpensive
shade lighten or darken err but with the
caveat and the knowledge that it will
adjust the foundations formula a bit not
necessarily in a bad way but like some
of them I would mix with my who this was
a foundation I loved and I don't like
what it looks like now and then other
ones I'd makes and I'm like oh that
looks fine so it's just kind of a
hit-or-miss but I do think it's a nice
inexpensive option for that okay the
body products okay I had never heard of
this somebody stop me if you have this
is the Aveeno positively radiant 62nd in
shower facial oh my gosh so apparently
this was like an allure Beauty winner
for I don't know some year very recent
like it's a newer product this stuff is
so cool so you put it on your face and
you kind of leave it on for 60 seconds
while you're showering so usually all
you know I don't know shave or all
whatever and it you it's got little like
kind of almost like little sand granules
if you will but there's not a ton so it
doesn't feel like you're wrecking your
skin or gonna give yourself micro tears
nothing like that it's really gentle but
it I feel like every time I've used it
in the shower which really I've been
using it every time I shower my skin
feels and looks rejuvenated and I'm like
that is so cool because I feel like I
always throw cleansers that I don't
really care about in the shower
because I don't wash wash my face every
single time I shower because sometimes
if I just recently washed it I'm like I
don't want to strip my skin anymore you
know but this is so nice I'm trying to
get Tyler to try it because it's I'm
like flabbergasted that I'd never heard
of it next is the Aveeno creamy
moisturizing oil
I had Tyler try this my husband and I've
been using this I am pregnant and I'm in
my third trimester so I've been really
into oils and moisturizers and all kinds
of stuff well this is not something I'm
using necessarily on my baby bump
although I totally would but I've kind
of got a routine going I will share with
you guys here soon in the next few weeks
specifically what have become like holy
grails for me so far no stretch marks
although everything I every time I hear
people telling about how they got them
they're like yeah I was so good and then
like I literally woke up one morning and
overnight they were there and I'm like
okay anyway okay I'm ready I'm like
mentally preparing this stuff is so nice
so I use it everywhere else on my body
right now and I love it on my hands and
in Tyler he's really particular about
moisturizer like body moisturizer
because he wants it to be like powder
dry like once it's in he wants it to set
he doesn't want to feel greasy I totally
get that feeling and this stuff it's
crazy because it's the moisturizing oil
kind of a lotion and yet it does dry so
quickly and so it's felt so good on my
dry knuckles just from winter and heat
and all of that and I am impressed
I will definitely repurchase this again
after and I totally bought this on a
whim and altas website so those are all
of the new products I've been trying
from Ulta let me know what you've been
trying from Ulta any recommendations you
have for my next haul in the future and
other than
I hope you'll subscribe and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
