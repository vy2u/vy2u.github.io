gonna be doing kind of a unboxing
potpourri show where I'm gonna be
unboxing the glossy box for this month
also the fabfitfun and a box i got from
pixie that just has some new goodies i
wanted to share with you guys because I
feel like nobody really well it's not
nobody but pixie is not often talked
about here on youtube and the products
kind of intrigued me so I wanted to show
them to you guys so let's start with the
glossy box the info for pricing and
stuff is down below and I think I think
I have a coupon code so if I do for like
I'm sure percent off or a couple dollars
off I'll put it down below so it's I'm
assuming the theme is love is in the air
everywhere I look around I just snuck a
peek sneak depite okay okay I'm gonna
grab the first thing I see so this is
the benefit Porefessional but it's just
a don't get that excited it's just a
trial I was hoping to be a little bigger
this is a very poor filling I mean
that's why it's called the professional
type of primer it's been a while since
I've tried it and my skin has changed a
lot so I'm kind of tempted to try it
again this is kind of adorable for like
travel or just to try out of course it's
point one fluid out so it's you know
probably one tenth of the size of the
original one but it does specifically
mentioned just focus on the problem
areas and for me when I was first doing
this like a year two ago with this I was
putting it everywhere and I didn't
really need it I just needed it on you
know my zones where I've got pores that
need to be filled so I think I will give
this a go actually again the next thing
I see is this bio Republic revitalizing
fiber mask now I've done these before
I've actually made my husband Tyler do
them as well and I didn't make him he
was I made him it's so funny you look
like a really creepy with these um so
I'll probably try this this is to soothe
dry skin perfect for after
so actually we're going on a cruise in a
little while I think in April or March I
don't know it's soon I might maybe I'll
save this and bring this with me to try
they're just on the cruise after I've
been in the Sun I'll be some locking it
up so the next thing in here is biteys
cosmetics Oasis gem lipstick and it says
it's matte and it says it's in the shade
heatwave Ruby oh here's some claims
8-hour long lasting unique satin matte
finish highly pigmented coverage ok the
packaging is really really cool like a
relic ahh oh it's it truly is like a
read now I think we've gotten one of
these before I don't know if it was from
glossy box or not but I know it was T's
cosmetics it was similar packaging it
was more of a peachy shade this looks
like a shade a might wear though it is
really pigmented you'd have to UM with
one snow even with one swipe that's
pretty pigmented that's one soil okay
that's not bad so it's a really pretty
color kind of wish I had gotten it in
like the fall you know what I mean as if
I can't save it till the fall Jessica
also it's winter but it already feels
like spring like even though it's
literally inches of snow outside my
window right now but I'm already like
thinking spring spring wise I think I'm
just too excited for spring to come all
right the next thing in here oh it's
like a roll-on thing it's by Ed treble
golden skin roll-on caviar eye gel I
mean in Germany it's got one of those
metal roller balls looks like that yeah
okay now now it's coming out so it's it
has like kind of a clean smell like
laundry but it's just you know I don't
know I don't want to put it on over my
makeup right now let's see what it says
about it I'm curious um whoa
$45 for the full size which I'm thinking
this might be the full size jeez
alright says we all want to look
refreshed even if we didn't get our full
eight hours of sleep it erases signs of
fatigue by firming in resuscitating Wow
resuscitating tired skin around the eyes
and it says tip always allow eye cream
to absorb for at least a minute before
applying makeup that way your foundation
or concealer
increase from the excess product that is
good advice um so this I actually will
use because like last night I didn't
sleep very well so I just feel like you
can even see it just tired so that but
even if it doesn't totally resuscitate
that area anything can help so alright
and the last thing in here which was
what I was really excited about is this
glam glow mud - foam thirsty cleanse
daily hydrating cleanser now I want to
look this up because some of the glam
glow products get horrible reviews by
dermatologists on that website Paula's
Choice where they have their Beauty PDO
which like an encyclopedia and all these
reviews of how it actually like what
ingredients are in it and if they're
actually good for your skin or not um
they didn't break down the packaging and
if the packaging is good for the
ingredients it's really cool um so I
haven't looked at this one up yet if
it's just a daily cleanser I would think
it couldn't be that bad cuz you wash it
off of your skin but we'll see but I
will look it up because if it's not I'm
excited to use it I want I want a glam
glow product to actually be good for
your skin I feel like everything I've
received in a box like yes and then I
look it up and it's like no it's
terrible we're just gonna what No
so yes that was actually you get the
full-size lipstick the L the gel roll on
the glam glow the little professional
and then also the mask so I would say
the two weakest things like the back I
like but it's one use so that kind of
stinks and the professional that's just
so tiny like I think they give us like a
deluxe size but these are pretty awesome
so I like it that let's move on let's do
the pixie stop really quickly just
because it's only a couple of things and
then we'll do the fat bit fun
they wrote me a really nice note okay so
yeah it's only three products but I was
just so curious it's his first kiss
plush get a glowing in love complexion
and kissable lips in moments pucker up
so the first thing is their glow ssin
that's genius
they do de w it's $22 but it's
definitely the full size I don't know if
there are shades of this it's their
brightening lotion it says it's got
lavender oil and mica or mica natural
glow creator botanical complex instantly
moisturizes and boosts dull skin yes
please lightweight nourishing protecting
and youth enhancing for all skin types
and says use in the morning daily apply
a thin layer on a cleanse tone skin to
have an extra layer anywhere morgue
Louis desires so wondering if it's
similar like the Mac strobe cream which
I almost bought online the other day and
that I didn't it looks like it might be
really similar so it's it really is like
a lotion but it does have this kind of
really pretty iridescent quality to it
do you guys see that but when you
totally blend it in it's not like super
detectable it's just gonna look really
pretty
underneath foundation or BB cream so I
rubbed it in so now you can't quite see
if you can see like a little hint of it
you know I am going to use a feather
I was gonna say I wanted to do like a
dupes video like if I did buy the Mac
strobe cream and compare these
side-by-side but this is only $10
cheaper so this is still kind of pricey
but if it's really awesome I don't know
so I'm excited to try this like tomorrow
morning alright the next thing in here
is this lip contour liner waterproof lip
liner and I'm yeah it's an invisible one
woohoo wondering what I'm wearing on my
face I will have it listed below I know
a lot of you guys have asked me to do
that and sometimes it's hard to remember
like I'm editing way after and it's hard
to remember but I will put that below so
it's just a clear I mean a true clear
liner I'll have to try it around your
lips so that way nothing will bleed
outside of it which I love the idea that
but I've never found one that really
worked so I will definitely try this and
I always love their cute like lime green
and white packaging I think it's so cute
so the last thing in here is their matte
luster lipstick and raspberry blush so
the the light the lip liner was $12 and
this lipstick is also 12 so they're
still kind of drugstore prices they're a
little higher I would say the drugstore
prices although I don't know some
drugstore brands but pixie can be found
at Target by the way and online so yes
this is in raspberry so just got the
cute why I'm not lime mint green and it
is a red so it's called a matte luster I
would call it more of a luster I mean I
guess it's kind of
it's really really moisturizing and
slippery which again I've mentioned with
brighter red lipstick I don't like that
slippery field I wanted to stay in place
and not move which I know not everyone
feels that way but that's just the way I
am that's just my taste but it's a
really pretty color isn't it so and
again if you've got really dry lips this
might be perfect because it does feel
really moisturizing so that was pretty
cool but lace for those products below
the next thing is the fact it's fun and
I don't I think this is there like it's
not a seasonal box like normal which I
just recently did like their winter box
I can link but I think it's like they're
yeah they're welcome box so I think this
is what you get when you first start
there's a lot in here always comes with
like a kind of magazine with what's
inside so I don't want to pink I just
want to see wow it's a lot of stuff just
peek in here with me guys jeez please so
first thing I'm seeing is this dark
chocolate organic balanced milk protein
shake see the thing about these is I
just look at this sugar and it's such a
high amount of sugar I'm like geez like
23 grams of sugar no I mean all three
good but that's one who's wonder about
things like this like how does that work
with your brain I'm not a health
nutrition person I just try and eat as
clean as I can but I've always wondered
about that so if you know about you know
there's so much sugar it makes it taste
better but is it I mean there are these
actually bad for you because that let me
know if you know because I'm I've always
been curious about that but it's dark
chocolate I mean I'm sure I will like it
and it's organic Valley is the brand oh
my gosh I'm excited about this next
thing this next thing is the soya polish
and this is very quickly becoming my
favorite polish brand because it just it
lasts for a long time without chipping
it goes all in one coat and I only have
like one or two of these so I think this
might be my third but this is a color I
would love it's in the shade Averell and
it's just that classic like I was
thinking Victoria Beckham because I have
one that she curated that similar to
this but this might be even prettier so
I am very excited about that the next
thing in here it's friends I'm assuming
it's headphones but they had these in
the winter box but oh these are you sure
these are white ones the
one for black which I really like - I
mean I love black and white doesn't
matter like most of my closet is black
white and gray I'm so boring but um I
like these so I mean you can never have
too many headphones I like to keep them
because I edit videos like I'll edit
them in battle is them on the couch in
the in the dining room all over the land
of course in here so it's kind of nice I
just have headphones everywhere so I'm
just gonna start spattering them
throughout the house spattering it's a
weird word choice if you watch Dexter
makes me think of that blood spatter the
next thing in here is this Tibetan goji
berry advance the anti-aging eye serum
with retinol and so I know this
passports of beauty is the brand and it
looks like it's the full size I like
goji berries to eat it's just kind of a
white cream to have smell know which is
good you should because a lot of times
fragrance can be you're taking for your
skin so I've never really understood why
with skincare they would add fragrance
um I I don't frankly I don't care what
it smells like I'd rather it not have a
smell if it's gonna be ruining my skin
so I will again definitely try this now
I've got like heavier one and this and I
was actually I don't know that I have an
eye serum right now I just have an eye
cream I don't know very excited about
that
um can you ever have too much skincare
this next thing I have received in so
many boxes this is the gorge I'll make
you look amazing daily spray and it's a
leave-in conditioner and I like it I
think I've used an entire bottle up but
I had like four bottles like this is
crazy so I ended up passing some on the
sisters because it's it's too much it's
too much so that's just kind of funny I
mean I don't know if I'll use it or not
I'll put in my hair drawer because I
think I did get rid of all the others I
liked it but it wasn't life changing so
I don't know if you haven't tried it
though I mean it might be really good
for your hair and you know everyone's
hair is very different this next one is
a jump rope and of course is this called
fab fit fun so they usually have a
really solid mix of things I think I've
actually received these in a past
festive fun box but I think
is really really cute I mean jump-roping
really is so good for you if you have
the space or you have a backyard or you
know whatever I mean it's the easiest
thing to do in the world even if you
have kids you know they could be jump
roping and you couldn't it's such an
amazing workout so I think that's really
cool and it's didn't paint I'm the next
thing is this shop teks gift card now I
have actually I again received one of
these in their last box and I actually
used it involved two new shirts with the
$25 so that I think I only ended up
paying like three dollars over so you
actually you know with some gift cards
you get $25 but the cheapest thing is
like $50 and you're like what like why
am i allowing you to use it but you
actually can get some really good deals
on stuff so I will use this I actually
bought some tank tops for the cruise and
maybe I will get some more I mean the
last thing in here is by renn it's
usually jewelry see it really is a solid
mix of stuff of course it is way pricier
way pricier than other subscription
boxes oh so it's a little heart pendant
it's just this gold like it's just this
little gold heart pendant 14 karat gold
dipped one point I don't know if that's
what it is PT black sapphire accent like
a little dot on the thing it's an 18
inch necklace
that's cute I will definitely wear that
I've received one from Wren that was
like a little moon with a little tiny
black sapphire in it and I love it
so this way I maybe I'll wear those
together the heart and the moon okay
that's adorable I love you to the moon
and back that's what amazing they go so
they always have really cute stuff I I
always love it but it's so pricey so
that's the other thing and I always say
that anytime my inbox them you know all
these things were sent to me for free so
I'm just here showing them to you but
you know me buying them I love the idea
fact that fun because it's so cute and
it's such a good mixture but if you
don't have that in your budget I mean
that's a lot of money
sothey it is what it is hopefully this
video was enjoyable for you and helpful
in your quest for finding subscription
boxes that you actually want to
subscribe to I know that's why I watch
them and if you would like to catch more
of my subscription box videos definitely
subscribe I will also link my past ones
below so you can see them and
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
