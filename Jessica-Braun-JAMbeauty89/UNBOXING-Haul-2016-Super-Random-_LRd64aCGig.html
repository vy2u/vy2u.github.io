gonna unbox some goodies that I got in
the mail one of them is the cozy mug
which I haven't unboxed in quite a while
but it's one of my favourite
subscription boxes I've ever received
and then I'm also gonna share with you
some new things from pixie that they
sent that just actually look really cool
so I want to show them to you guys so
let's go ahead and get into it so the
first thing the cozy mug it's a tea
subscription box but they always have
like other little goodies thrown in
which I love I'll have the pricing info
and all of that down below if you're
curious they usually have it like themed
according to like though not the weather
but the season whoa this season or
holidays nearby which i think is just
fun and tea is something that I go
through so quickly and I love trying new
tea to discover maybe something new that
I want to buy a full box up so it's
perfect for me so it looks like this one
is spring themed and they always have
their little owl and I used to have this
little sequined owl that when I used to
film where I used to live I had my
little sequined owl namesake Juan Tyler
Nathan up in the back and we always joke
that this owl and say Kwan were like
boyfriend and girlfriend right
anywho alright love some shoot here I'm
gonna give you guys a pink so cute they
usually I grab some of this stuff and
you can see some of the teeth and filled
nail polish let's start nail polish so
even though it's the two boxes where you
go randomly throw in like cutesy other
things this is a wedding I love nail
polish in blazed and it's very springy I
would say spring watering on summer and
then but it looks like an awesome this
reminds me of China Glaze flip flop
fantasy if you've been wanting to try
that for a long time this is like exact
and I own flip flop fantasy this is
exactly the right color and it looked
really really opaque so I will
definitely be trying this on the toes
we're going on the cruise really soon so
that would be perfect
so the next thing in here these are the
t's that are out this is the brand Aloha
and there's four different to use this
one is beauty organic herbal tea it says
pretty good juniper berry
rooibos I never say that right the
biscuits and dandelion get you blowing
this one is smart which says put on your
thinking cap simulate earth-shattering
ideas with green tea and ginkgo this is
so cool
protect and this one says bolster your
defenses echinacea elderberry and
elderflower combined empowers with
healing Ayurvedic herbs if you know how
to say that you can help me out there
and then this one is clean which has
rejuvenate and refresh the dandelion
raspberry and ginger so all of those
sound awesome I'm really excited and I
like the idea of like ones that are
specific for certain things like one of
my favorite teas is a sleepytime tea
because it really does make me feel a
little bit sleepy ER and relaxed and I
love that it's for a specific kind of
thing so like some of these are for you
know kind of mind clarity and things
like that I think that's cool so the
first thing that's right here is cute
pink stuff please yeah I was hoping it
would be chocolate this is the Moser raw
private chocolate tears daily oh my gosh
it smells like oh it's one of those bars
I feel like I'm opening like a walk of
are like is the golden ticket in there
look how beautiful I love when bars to
just like one giant piece am i weird
does anyone I gotta try by I'm gonna
ruin it but I want to try by mmm this is
like dark chocolate not like so dark
it's just straight-up bitter but it's
borderline which I like kind of they're
really not me in the night cuz I used to
not like it but this is good but it's
definitely dark so if you don't like
dark chocolate you would love it but oh
my gosh it's really good dark chocolate
is melt baby boob now I have melted
chocolate all over my hands saving it
for later folks all right the next rap
thing is
forty who party and Sons is the brand
apiece and this is pomegranate oolong
and this is Paris oh I love that it's
that this one is a black tea and of
course this one's an oolong tea awesome
single silken sachet in there this is
awesome
I'm so excited so much TV and the last
thing in here and they usually do this
they'll sometimes sound like a cute
blank card that you can use that you
know to send in this one is adorable
it's got like glitter in it and it says
Paris is always a good idea Audrey
Hepburn that's pink on the inside and
even this is cute oh my gosh so I love
that I think it's just so cute because
not only is it see but they do have that
extra cute stuff so alright moving along
the next thing is just stuff from pixie
I wanted to show you guys they sent me
some stuff last month that was actually
really good and some of them have become
favorites you might see them in a
favorites video coming up um but they
sent me some things I've actually
already opened this and I've actually
already tried some of it and some of
that I'm wearing today so the actually
the thing I've really tried and open is
it came in this box they've got their
classic green and this is their minimal
makeup no makeup makeup what is it
actually called book of beauty minimal
makeup so it's just got these um you
know it's got a magnetic closure and you
open it and it's got six different pans
I use this to kind of bronze and contour
with right here and then I use this
blush today and then I actually use
these eyeshadows here on my lid earlier
this morning like 13 hours ago when I
was getting ready for work I've kind of
touched up with some of this as well but
I also use some other shadows so these
are both highlighters over here I
haven't tried these yet i've swatched
everything and they are super pigmented
and not really powdery or anything
that's what I was scared of but they're
not those are the highlighters the blush
the blush kicked up a little powder but
I I didn't mind using it okay so there's
the blush it's just like a really pretty
peach shade and there's that kind of
bronzer color here the eyeshadow shades
the line is like
why it doesn't really show up on my skin
but so they're creamy I think that my
favorite pieces really are the blush and
bronzer cuz they've stayed on for quite
a while and I just really liked using
them and these shimmery shadows are just
so pretty and I again I need to try the
highlighters so that was cool the next
thing in here is this hydrating milky
mist it says it has hyaluronic acid and
black oath it says deep moisture youth
preserving miracle mix mist on
moisturizer provides a surge of
hydration with hyaluronic acid to plump
skin by trapping moisture added black
coat with pro vitamin A linoleic acid
and vitamins b1 b2 b6 make it the
ultimate remedy remedy for thirsty skin
so you can use it before makeup it'll
moisturize and prep your skin at
nighttime you can put it on first and
then put on like your real moisturizer
and then it said any time you can just
spray it for a burst of hydration close
eyes and mist over your face let's try
it shall we let me I haven't sprayed it
all so we get it going okay oh it
actually it's like a nice sprayer okay
it really is a fine mist like finer than
my mac fix+ for sure just feels good do
I look glowy or feel like I need more of
a here alone there we go
yeah I really like the nozzle it's kind
of a gross look like it really does look
like milk but if that doesn't bother you
then you're gonna be good to go but it
really does look super smell no I don't
think I just smell it all so it feels
good I mean I like moisturizing type
spray especially this time of year the
last thing in here was I have used this
they're nourishing lip polish with
apricot and grapefruit oils and it's
just a clear like lip not lip gloss
really like a lip balm but it has these
like exfoliating rubber things on it
it's kind of bendy and so when you put
it on it kind of exfoliates it away in a
really comfortable way and it has helped
my lips a lot they were hold on I
literally had chocolate on the corners
of my mouth why didn't you guys tell me
it it really exfoliates in a really
comfortable way and I really like
using it and my lips were so chapped
like two days ago and they're totally
back to normal cuz I used this like the
night I realized how shocked they were
and then the morning after and then this
morning as well and they're just like
totally back to normal so I like it it's
just really comfortable and it's I mean
you don't have to scrub out it you could
just court some out and just put it on
and as like a lip balm but I really like
the scrubby things on there too so
that's all for this video I know it's
kind of a short quick random one and I
don't do videos quite like this all the
time but I used to do them all the time
