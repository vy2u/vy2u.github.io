some unboxing so I don't do a lot of
unboxings on my channel anymore
she's kind of grown out of a lot of
different subscription boxes but there
are a few I still get fabfitfun is one
of them they actually send this to me
and it's come more of it like a
quarterly one so I'm always honest with
you guys like when I'm showing these
things if I think they're worth it if I
think they're not
I'm etc so we will open this one
together I haven't looked in at all
usually I like look through but I
haven't at all this time so I will be
seeing it for the first time with you
guys so we'll talk about that one that I
also want to unbox my stitch fix for
this month this is something I don't get
that off and I haven't gotten it
honestly I don't think I've gotten one
since we've moved into our house which
we moved in last summer but I got a lot
before we moved because you basically
you talked to a stylist online and you
say okay here's what I really like I
need new black flats and I really want a
blazer for work and I just want some
tops or I'd you know or you could just
say surprise me you have all your sizes
it's very very specific it's my favorite
clothing subscription box I've tried and
so I can link my last one I did like a
long time ago but I really really it's
just a box I really really liked so I
paid for it out of my own pocket cuz I
genuinely love it but it's nice because
they send you the products and you can
return all of them you can return some
of them you know etc so I'll get to that
one second because I figure most of you
guys are interested in the fact that fun
so this is beauty lifestyle fitness
everything it's I want to say fifty
dollars a month so it is it's pricier I
mean there it's it's expensive but
you're only getting it four times a year
and I'm pretty sure you can just cancel
at any time but it always comes with
like a little pamphlet explaining
different things different little
articles things like that which i think
is really really cute this is spring and
I'm so excited that spring is even close
enough that we can call something a
spring box I am so ready for spring so I
will link fabfitfun down below if you're
interested they usually have like they
have $50 off of hellofresh that is
awesome so opening up oh my gosh I'm
already excited peaking in they have all
full-size things it's always a mix and I
think the reason I have grown to like
this allows because I really got tired
of like just makeup and even though like
I get my Sephora play box I really like
that because there
that are at Sephora typically their
newer products or their bestsellers but
this really was a mix and it's just
refreshing to get you know something you
know maybe a scarf but you'd also get
maybe sunglasses and some skincare maybe
some sunscreen and it was just all
different stuff and really really nice
expensive stuff so the value of these
things is usually pretty high okay first
things so cute
it's from the brand Maya Brenner Los
Angeles and it's a little gold necklaces
oh no bracelet it just says love that's
so cute I love dainty little things like
this I have one necklace actually that I
got in a fabfitfun and it just it's a
gold bar necklace and it just as happy
and I wear that all of the time and the
gold hasn't worn off anyway any in any
way so it was really high-quality and I
got it in effective than I love it so
totally excited I think that's so sweet
ish is the brand they've sent before
this is their lips statement palettes
I don't usually love lip pallets to be
honest with you
so it comes with a little lip brush in
it and here it is it's got what 12
colors let's watch a few of these ooh
they are more pigmented than I would
have guessed
so I swatch like a pink and then like
more of a peach so I think my problem is
in the past when I tried lip palettes
they're never super pigmented so I'm
like why even bother but actually that
was more pigmented than I expected so I
will definitely give it a try let you
guys know how I like it as I've tried it
more and more whoo so full-size skincare
this is the Murad skin perfecting lotion
says it's a lightweight oil-free
moisturizer provides shine free
hydration for blemish prone skin
it's got honey extract which is the
natural humectant queen of meadow
refined skin texture while arnica or
arnica soothes skin for a smoother
healthier looking complexion so it's
definitely full-size I love that it's a
squeezy to see what else yeah you just
squeeze it through I've heard amazing
things about Murad skin care and I
really have not tried a lot so I am very
excited to try this it sounds like it
might be perfect for spring as you're
kind of coming out of the dry dry skin
and you still need some way
you maybe don't need as much as you did
in the dead of winter I'm very excited
to give that a try and just try more
Murad in general
next thing is Rachel pally I saw that
was like an interview with her in that
little newspaper magazine thing they
sent with let's see so it's like a
little dust bag oh my gosh look at this
clutch oh my gosh that is so cute
Oh perfect for spring so I love this
kind of minty teal I love that print
inside and then you can actually unzip
it and access the inside there's even
like a little divider halfway through it
feels incredibly well made oh my gosh
so that is amazing very excited to have
that and this is something for me I'm
six months pregnant so which you will
see when we look at the stitch fix stuff
but this is something that I could
totally put my things in you know my
wallet my phone and slide into a diaper
bag and it's still you know I'd still
have my stuff kind of corralled but I
don't have to carry it separate from the
diaper bag so that is probably how I'll
use it oh my gosh so this is from the
brand Free People which is kind of a
pricey brand and it says with love from
Texas but it's also it looks like it's
like with another brand understated
leather so it is it like it's like
sleeping mask
that's cute wonder if you could like
freeze is it one of those things that
you can like freeze the inside because
it feels like it's like squishy like you
could yeah or maybe even just
refrigerate it I don't know but that's
what it looks like so I love again the
mints with like the little metallic
stars that's really really cute next
thing is this dove exfoliating body
polish reveal silky smooth skin with new
dove exfoliating body polish but yeah it
looks like it's a little bit
moisturizing too so it's just a little
trial size but I'm definitely excited to
give that a try next thing is from
dermelect cosmeceuticals it says
makeover peptide in suit infused
concealer and treatment Oh for your
nails anti-aging Ridge filler I could
totally use that I have not painted my
nails
a very long time I'm just kind of
leaving them be for a little bit I feel
like they need it and deserve it
but if I start back up again this is
totally something I would use because it
sounds like it would just genuinely be
really good for your nails which mine
certainly deserve this next thing is to
say a candle number one Manhattan Beach
it's from anderson lily and it's the
notes are bergamot musk white jasmine
brazilian soft woods citrus and
heliotrope oh my gosh oh it smells very
clean very springy but not overpowering
and I love the simplicity of this little
like jar little container it's
definitely like a nice metal it's heavy
but again it's just so pretty that looks
so pretty over on my vanity there I can
just picture burning this with the
windows open and a pries glowing doesn't
that sound so nice okay next thing in
here it's like in a little pink clutch
if you will oh it's like little masks
can see Beauty lint masks so these are
collagen infused you just kind of put
them over your lips and leave them on
for awhile 15 to 20 minutes it says you
can use them every day or two to three
times a week and it comes with five of
them that sounds nice especially again
as we're getting slowly out of winter I
feel like that'd be nice to just revive
your lips a bit like I get very dry lips
in the wintertime especially so that
sounds lovely Tyler's gonna make fun
because I'm sure they'll look hilarious
on oh this sounds awesome okay looks
hilarious but it's a physique 57 massage
roller that sounds nice I've got very
sore everything right now so this
actually I like that it's a bright color
I'm gonna put it down we have a little
exercise room in our basement and that
sounds like something that would be
really really nice right now really any
time but I'm picturing using this on my
calves I wonder if you can that's cool
so that was everything in there like I
said I'll put my link for facets on
below if you are interested I like I
said I liked it
I don't like my least favorite products
probably the lip palate I don't know how
much I'll use that but other than that I
actually really liked everything the eye
mask I don't know how much I'll use that
but everything else I know that I'll use
and again it's not all makeup it's not
all skin care it's a really good mix of
different things so you feel like you're
just getting to kind of refresh your
house in little ways each time you get
it my stitch fix if I remember correctly
you pay like a $20 styling fee and so
you pay that $20 no matter what so if
you get the box and you you get five
products every time if you end up hating
all five and you want to send all of
them back they give you a life already
addressed return big ole USPS bag that
everything will fit in she can put it
all in there and send it back you don't
have to pay the postage but you lose
that $20 so there is that caveat that it
really behooves you to buy at least one
item because then at least that $20
styling fee would apply to an item that
you buy does that make sense so I always
go into this knowing like okay Jessica
you're buying at least one thing because
that $20 you're not just gonna kiss
goodbye to you know so that is something
to keep in mind now you can let them
know like hey there's like a pricing
option where you can say I want cheaper
stuff I want medium price stuff I want
really expensive stuff I don't know
who's checking the really expensive
stuff um but I will say that is one of
the biggest complaints is that even
though cheap stuff seems to still be
pricey but for me I'm like you know what
if it's a piece I really really love or
it's a staple piece or you know whatever
it might be it's sometimes it's worth it
but you have to know yourself and your
budget
and know what you can or can't afford um
so what I do like is they give you like
a style guide so the pieces they sent
you from the stitch fix closet they show
you what it would look cute paired with
and I I love that I think that is so
cute and so fun now I am pregnant so I
did tell them like hey I need some
maternity clothes I just need maternity
tops I've got lots of leggings blah blah
blah so I'm hoping I've peaked in a
little bit but I'm hoping these are all
just tunics and maternity tops and stuff
like that oh and I specifically said
that I wanted fitted maternity tops I
just like that like what I'm wearing
today
I can show you if you're just wanting to
see what I look like right now six
months pregnant but this is a very loose
top like it just flares out and actually
it goes with the bell I just don't have
it on um but I I I like fitted tops I
don't know maybe I'm weird like that but
I do so I'm intrigued um so they leave
you a little note from your actual
stylist she said I looked for some
fitted tops as well as a couple tops
that'll be great for layering this
season so then she goes through the
specific things and says oh look really
cute with this other item I sent you so
I love that it feels very personal and I
really have not felt that from any other
box that I've I've let's see what's in
here
the first thing is from Lux &amp;amp; Co and
it's there Oh any maternity shoulder
cutout knit top in Burgundy um and so
I've learned with Maternity sizes just
to get the same size you normally get
just a maternity so I got an extra small
now obviously when I'm nine months
pregnant might not work as well but I
figure you know if we have another kid
I'm gonna save some of these clothes for
that too
obviously anyway I think this is so fun
I love that the shoulders are cut out
this is the only piece I'd already
looked at and I was like oh my gosh um
because I feel like I've looked in
Maternity stores and none of them I
found some really cute stuff and I
bought some really cute stuff but none
of them have been like trendy and I'm
like can I please get like a trendy
maternity top can we please have that so
I love that it's got the shoulder kind
of cut out throughout I think that's so
fun it's again kind of ruched at the
side so I can you know fit a growing
belly I like the color
again I could totally throw a blazer on
top of this and wear it to work but this
is one that I'm probably going to keep
so this one this is what I'm always
nervous about these are all expensive so
this top is $48 now I will say as I
looked up attorney tops on like Macy's
website you know it just so varies in
price right you know what I mean so this
is one I still think I'm gonna keep
because I really just wanted a trendy
top and I was so excited to see that
thing they spent is I like the green and
white stripe oh and it has like this
little like beige collar so it's the
love of pelham eternity Tomy suede
neckline maternity knit top in olive so
again this is extra small it has the
ruching on the side that's pretty much
it I like that it's got a different
color collar because it just instantly
makes it look just a little bit
different the price on this one is 54 I
dunno oh that's the other thing if you
buy all five items they give you like a
percentage off though like for example
if I were to buy everything you get 25%
off so I would say $67 you know so you
kind of you know you I don't know I
guess what I'm saying is you you do with
a grain of salt cuz it's like well but
I'm also still spending a lot of money
if I buy of all five of these but then
if you really love all five it might be
worth it you know
but I this is one that I really really
like - I love stripes so much I have a
lot of stripes already but I don't have
any most of my striped items are black
and white so the idea of green and white
I really like and it's longer so I could
wear it with leggings next item is a
gray this is cute
grey one this is the Danielle rain
Daniel rain maternity Hensen maternity
mixed material top so it's like a tank
top and this is what she was saying
I could layer with you know maybe a
cardigan something like that but it's
got these really cute buttons I love
that it's kind of somewhat pulled in
right under you know the bustline but
not really so it's gonna be a little bit
looser but again with it I have tons of
Blazers and I can totally wear them
right now you know cuz I don't need to
shut the blazer but I need those
maternity tops to go under it so that I
can you know pull it off this would go
really well I've got a navy blazer I
love that would look so cute at this I
have a bright pink one I think I could
totally rock with this as well I think I
even have like a striped one that looked
really cute so this one is 64 so this is
the most expensive one so I'm really
gonna have to think about like okay is
it worth that much or can I find
a tank top like this for cheaper maybe
that this might be one this one I'm like
50/50 on so I'm gonna really think about
it and decide if I want to keep that one
or not seems like a lot of money for a
tank top so this is from that love of
hella brand as well again love a pelham
eternity de vide button detail let's
turn to the top so it's a nice eggplant
purple and let's see I love that it's
got these little buttons on the sleeve
there I think that's so cute again it's
gonna be fitted it's got the ruching and
it's really stretchy so it'll probably
fit me throughout the end of it and it's
kind of a 3/4 length sleeve which is
perfect that means I can wear it alone
that's the problem a lot of the tops I
have right now
I can't necessarily wear alone I always
have to have something on top of it but
in the spring you know it's gonna start
warming up a bit and I don't want to
have layers and layers on
especially since under all of these I'm
gonna want some kind of camisole just
kind of holding everything together
so this one is $48 this is one I'm
pretty sure I'm going to keep just
because I I love the color purple and I
need more of those kind of more springy
tops and the last thing in here this is
black it's from lolly and it's the lolly
Praja maternity tie front blouse so it's
black and it's just kind of a looser
thinner material so you definitely want
to wear something underneath it because
it looks like it'd be sheer ish but it
just ties around so it looks like it
ties at the natural waist but I think
you know it'll tie higher so again I
might eventually be too big for this top
you know it's a little bit looser but I
think it sits where it will tie it's
only gonna cover so much so if I'm
really big it might not cover enough so
this is one again I'm kind of 50/50 on
whether or not I'm gonna keep it but I
like that it's plain black I don't
really have any plain black but then on
the other hand it's like well the plain
black would probably be easy to find so
this one in that grey one I'm on the
fence about but that black one was $54
so basically what you do
is you you know decide what you want to
keep what you don't you do it online you
just go to stitch fix you know into your
account and it says okay what do you
wanna keep and what I really like about
it is if I decide to not keep those two
items I'll just click on there and say
okay here's why I didn't like it the fit
was wrong or and this is especially
great when you're not pregnant because I
loved this program most when I you know
was just my normal size but it's just
really nice because then they really
start to hone in on what you like and
what you don't like and they keep those
records as far as I know because if I
say no I really don't like this because
it was loose around the ankle maybe it
was like skinny jeans and it was too
loose or maybe it was too tight around
the ankle I can say that so then the
next time they try to send me like
skinny pants or skinny jeans they know
like okay make sure it's a little more
fitted or a little less fitted you know
and it's it's really cool because I feel
like every time I get a new box it is
better than the last time now obviously
this is my first maternity time doing it
I don't know if I'll do another one
while I'm pregnant just because at a
certain point it's like okay now it's
too late and I'm almost done and you
know it's not really worth it but I
thought this was kind of the perfect
time because I really am in need of just
a few more pieces and now I feel like I
have enough to mix and match and make it
work for the rest of the time so
especially as we head into spring
because I have a lot of wintery clothes
so with that in mind I hope you enjoyed
this video like I said I'll link stitch
fix I'll link oh oh
link my fabfitfun as well if you're
interested in either one let me know if
you like these unboxings I don't like I
said I don't do them a lot so I don't
know I'm like do you guys even like them
are they worth me doing I mean I'm gonna
be getting the stitch fixed anyway so
you know I just figure it's kind of fun
to share but other than that I hope you
enjoyed and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
