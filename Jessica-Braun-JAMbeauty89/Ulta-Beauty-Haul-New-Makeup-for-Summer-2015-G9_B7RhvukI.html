humongous Ulta haul I went a little
crazy shopping at Ulta online I was
really excited because Ulta actually
contacted me and asked if I'd be willing
to do a video in collaboration with them
and I you guys need to know that I like
teared up because that's a that's a big
deal to me and I know there are huge
youtubers that are like oh like that's
no big deal but I literally just about
crying because I was like this is the
Ulta like the story that I've gone to
for so many years actually it's talking
to me so I freaked out a little bit I
was so excited that they wanted to
collaborate with me so Thank You Alta I
am very excited that I got a ton of
drugstore things that I saw were new I
actually ordered this while it's still
in my head even because I kept seeing
all these new things coming out and was
like I want to try them and you guys are
recommending a ton of things to me that
I also wanted to try their makeup brands
and I feel like I don't own enough of
that I want to be able to review for you
guys that are drugstore brands like
essence they have a ton of essence
they're Delta and I really haven't tried
much so I got some essence things some
Kardashian beauty things because I've
never really tried any of their stuff
and just a bunch of other new things and
there are just a couple high-end items
that I'll show at the end so let's go
ahead and get into the hall okay so the
first things that I wanted were some
more Revlon lipsticks these are their
Super Lustrous
I have like two or three and they are
the best so the shapes I picked out were
cherries in the snow which is like this
deep kind of cool toned berry red that
looks absolutely beautiful and it's
gonna be amazing like during the
holidays and then I also picked out
peach me which is a more neutral peach
than what I already own I don't think I
have a color like this so I was really
excited to add to my Super Lustrous
collection because those lipsticks are
amazing
I also picked out two more of the new
shades at least I think these are the
new ones from the Maybelline matte line
so I picked out blushing pout which is
just that every day kind of ma vie light
pink color I probably have way too many
of these but these the formula these are
absolutely amazing as well and the other
color
was clay crush which again is a more
neutral peach I just felt like I really
don't have any that are like that
neutral peach I keep saying that but I
really don't so I'm so excited to give
those a try as well I picked out three
different concealers some of them are
new and one of them is not one of them I
got because I've heard it's really good
at like facial highlighting without
shimmer but just for like a lighter
color and it's the Revlon Photoready
stick concealer I got mine in the
lightest shade 0:01 and it's just a
really light concealer that I thought
might be really nice for highlighting
your face without adding shimmer because
I really don't have anything to do that
with so I'm excited to give this a try
the other concealers I picked up were
the Maybelline master conceal which I've
heard has really really high coverage
like crazy high coverage and it's just
kind of like a squeezy tube type and I
got it in the lightest shade which is
number 10 fair I feel like you could
probably use it the same way as the
Revlon Photoready one so I'm really
excited to try this one out and the last
concealer I got is the brand new
maybelline superstay better skin one I
feel like this is gonna be nice and
lightweight for the summer time cuz it's
so hot and the last thing you want are
like those really crepey lines because
you've got a like like a high coverage
one on here in the summer it just
doesn't mesh well with the weather in my
opinion so I'm excited to give this a
shot I didn't buy the foundation because
I haven't really heard that great of
things about it but I did want to try
this now I also am trying a new primer
this is I think this has been out this
is the Rimmel lasting finish primer if
you guys have been watching my channel
you know I love the Rimmel lasting
finish foundation top five foundations
absolutely incredible I'm so excited to
try it with this primer though because
I've never tried it says it increases
foundation wear for up to eight hours
we'll see also okay you guys recommended
this like crazy this is the Maybelline
full and soft mascara I got it in very
black just the regular not the
waterproof you guys when I asked for a
mascara recommendation it was
overwhelmingly this and this has been at
drugstores for years like it's been
there forever it's like old school
packaging like no updates there I might
do a review on this because I just don't
maybe people are talking about I just
never
I don't know I also finally got the real
techniques blending sponge all of you
guys recommend this as well and I was
like I need to know what the fuss is
about because I love the beauty blender
but it's more expensive than this so I
can't wait to try it out and try to get
it does have the same feel as the beauty
blender which is really exciting to me
yeah I this is the brand new at the
drugstore this is the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi powder Glo illuminator and I got it
in the shade and I got it in the shade
ice and it's just really really cool
toned I mean like really really cool
tone but I think if you use a light hand
it can look really nice I'm excited to
give this a try I've heard mixed reviews
on these too but they have a few other
shades in this as well this has been
sold out at drugstores near me I can
never find it but it was in stock on
Ulta calm so I was excited about that
now getting into like the brand specific
things I got a few things from NYX
because there are certain NYX products I
love and there are others that I feel
like I haven't even dealt into and
there's so much that NYX has and I love
I always get caught at the NIC area at
Ulta because I end up watching
everything I love that you can swatch it
all so this is one that I picked out the
NYX blush and soft spoken it's in their
new packaging their HD blushes this is
I'm wearing it today this is the most
beautiful natural peach colored blush so
if you're looking for one like that this
is this is perfect and they're so cheap
and they're so amazing and they stay on
for a really really really long time I
also have the HD blush in well blush but
it's in the shade taupe and it's a
really great own the contour powder I
love that as well which is why I wanted
to try it their blushes I also got their
NYX matte bronzer it's a really weird
tone I don't own a bronzer this tone
which is nice and I'm gonna play with it
and see it's a really nice it has a
really nice feel to it but it's almost
like a rosy bronze but not it's like a
peachy bronze but not I can't it's just
an interesting tone so I'm excited to
give it a try I might love it and the
last next thing I got was their skinny
mascara you guys recommended this like
crazy - I think it's gonna be a dupe for
the it cause
it's tightline one it's the exact same
wand I just ran out about your cosmetics
once so I might do like a dupe
comparison video this let me know if
you'd be interested because if this
works well this is so much cheaper than
the cosmetics one it's crazy right now
the essence beauty
if you don't know essence beauty or if
you've never really delved into it they
have some amazing things from what I
have tried and they're all like $3
they're so cheap I mean they're like on
par with ELF price-wise if not cheaper
so this is their silky touch blush and I
got this one in the shade adorable it
just looked like a nice kind of everyday
pink color it swatches beautifully it's
I mean this is more for a few fair
skinned this shade but they had a few
other choices and I'm so excited to give
this a try to see how the lasting power
is with it but I also got a little eye
shadow not quad but a little palette
it's in the shade 0-1 nude and it's
literally called all about nude
eyeshadow and it has six shades in it
and I love that the packaging is simple
you can see it there's no extra bulk to
it and I just thought these colors for
so pretty they're easily blending on my
fingers or with my fingers and they just
seem like a nice like if you like that
kind of washy look you'd probably really
like this if you're trying to be really
really precise this probably wouldn't be
ideal for you but I really like it I got
four different Kardashian beauty things
because I have never tried anything and
I think they redid it remember they have
the chroma line is that even still
around I want to say it is but now this
one says Kardashian beauty it doesn't
say chroma so I don't know I wonder if
you guys know is that the same line or
did they just redo it and revamp it and
then rename it too many reasons I don't
know I'm so curious that this is the
radiant on gray blush but it's got these
three different shades of pink and I
swatch this earlier and squeal because
it reminds me of my hard candy one that
I really really like so beautiful I
cannot wait stress this is the kind of
blush that if you're fair ish like I am
you can put it on and you don't need a
highlight or anything it's just gorgeous
the way it is and then I also got their
Cabana bronzed it's a huge bronzer like
the wet and wild ones and it's just a
beautiful
hi oid bronzer and it's got a nice shape
to it but it's not too deep I don't
think it does put a little bit orange
but you can kind of if you wanted to
just get one color you can like this far
side could just be a highlight I also
got the honey stick in the shade natural
honey and it's just the one is really
really long but it's just a really
natural this actually might look nice
over the peachy colored lipsticks that I
got just kind of a natural honey look
that's absolutely the last Kardashian
thing I got was their intimate spotlight
long-lasting illuminator and it's kind
of like a cream o it is a cream
illuminator but it's like golden it's
really really pretty it reminds me in a
way of the like color pop one's kind of
for the high-end thinks I got I was
really excited because with one of them
I bought a lorac thing and you got a
free mascara and also is pretty good
about that and then with the benefit
things I got I was gonna get just one of
the box blushes but then it was like in
those are like $28 but it was like spend
$35 and benefit and you get a free kit
of different things from benefit and I'm
like maybe I will buy the other one that
I was thinking about so I'm gonna show
you the kit that it came with so it came
with a little lolli tint a little
high-beam a little pore fessional and
then a sample size of the they're real
mascara I was like what if you don't
have these or you're wanting to try
other things this was amazing that it
just came free with this so the benefit
things I got I got hervana this has been
on my wish list forever it's so
beautifully like when you swatch it
together it's just this beautiful cool
toned pink that I just love I've been
eyeing this for years so I'm so excited
to have this and then the one that I was
like I kind of want and that when I saw
the free thing I was like yes I'm
getting it is the benefit Dallas blush
it's almost a bronzy blush really it is
but it's so beautiful again it's kind of
like a rose colored contour bronzer it's
beautiful and then the lorac thing I got
is there I haven't
heard about this this is their lorac Pro
mat and it's like a small one I'm like
why is no one talking about this this
would have been perfect to travel on my
honeymoon with because as these
perfectly neutral ones they're all matte
but then it has like a black you can use
to like loan line your lash line on the
bottom so nice Browns a white some
creams and of course the lorac shadows
are always insanely I mean insanely
buttery they almost feel like cream
they're so freakin pigmented I will link
all the things that I mentioned down
below let me know I mean the reason I'm
hauling and buying this stuff is because
I want to review it on my channel let me
know in the comments so I can know kind
