move my coffee mug I'm gonna be unboxing
beef at the table but I couldn't have to
say that fabfitfun box for summer I do
have a $10 off code they do send me this
quarterly there's no contract it's not a
sponsorship but they send it to me for
free to do with what I please and I like
to unbox them on my channel so they did
give me a $10 off code which is Jam
beauty I will have the link below and
yeah let's go ahead and open this sucker
so this is kind of a more expensive box
to be honest with you it's $50 I know
I'm like that's expensive because when I
think of like submission box I'm like
yeah birch box $10 it's $10 even
boxycharm $20 like it's not although
it's boxycharm or no anyway so $50 is a
lot but if you break it down quarterly
all right well if each quarter is three
months 50 divided by three that's a
little over 15 bucks so it's not crazy
when you think about it especially when
you see what's in it
it really is like everything's full-size
it's nice brands it's usually like over
three hundred dollars worth of stuff so
I think it's worth it when you think
about it that way but you also have to
keep in mind your own budget do you
really need this do you really want to
spend so you need to know yourself but
for me this is one of my favorites
because it is different it's not just
makeup or just skincare it's a little
bit everything I usually get like
jewelry or a scarf or like all kinds of
stuff so let's go out and dig in I'll
shut up
so it always comes with first of all so
he's just so happy look look Lee always
comes with a little magazine to explain
the products why they were in there
there's little um just articles all
kinds of stuff so that's always fun and
you can find like the original prices of
everything which actually let me pull
this out and find that page because that
always blows my mind when I see the
actual price of my that's so expensive
there we go
all right so yeah the first page is
usually the what's in the box what's in
the box
I am a nerd alright so first thing this
is what I was the most excited about
please I've already peaked I
he looked in our students eyes is this
makeup bag I actually saw this like it
was like a Facebook ad or something for
this summer box and it's still early if
you're watching this when I upload it so
you they cease sell out they tend to
sell out so if you are gonna do it I
would definitely say do it earlier and
we set up later but I loved this box and
now I'm like I already did my hospital
bag and I already have all that makeup
and I make it back and I'm like maybe I
switch that makeup and put in here it
doesn't matter just of it I really like
this so the brand of this is Yumi Kim -
makeup train case $58 that's insane
so they have different patterns I love
the pattern I got but you open the top
compartment and it's got a little zipper
area and then it's got much this is a
gift for you $50 off of your purchase of
200 at Yumi Kim OH 200 anyway but it's
got a little brush area too so I'm like
this is really perfect for travel and
then when you open the next one it's
just a big open compartment so I really
like this I love makeup bags so like I
geek out I love getting fresh makeup
bags and getting rid of the old and
cause makeup you guys bags for me they
get dirty like even when I clean them
I'm like oh now it's all dirty so I'm
like getting fresh makeup bags and that
one's exciting um so they now let you
customize now they just sent me this
stuff you guys know I'm always up front
with you but if you look at it it says
you select like what you want out of
some of these products so like you could
have gotten the makeup thing or a beach
towel and so I'll try to explain to you
like the options that's pretty cool I
think that's new for them and that's a
neat option to be able to customize just
a little bit if you're like you know I
don't need any makeup bags but actually
I could use a new beach towel that's
kind of cool so next thing in here holy
crap the TARDIS pro glow now I will show
you I'm gonna open it to show you I'm
not gonna swatch it I've already owned
this and declared it it's actually
really good pal I just wasn't using it
so I'm going to put this maybe in a
giveaway so this is what it looks like
it's got gorgeous shimmer
this is what's so cool though so this is
$45 you spent $50 on this box you've
already pretty much made your money back
here assuming you didn't already have it
or something like that but again they
have the option so you could have gotten
this or you could have gotten the Tarte
TARDIS Pro to go palette and it comes
with their liquid liner so again you
have that option but really really cool
I'm gonna save this for an upcoming
giveaway stay tuned so one of you guys
can have this but that is awesome next
product in here this is from Pharrell
this is crazy
this is $89 look this is like a mistake
I'm like oops they put too much in here
no I guess it's supposed to so it says
let me just read what it says guess what
you're one of the first to get your
hands on pharaoh's newest revolutionary
device it's powered by bluetooth
technology and advanced skin sensors to
create a totally personalized profile
which is sent straight to the newly
launched foreo luna app so you use it to
clean your face but it says it's also a
smart beauty coach so it measures your
skin moisture reveals skin age
customizes cleansing routine and your
app records your progress it takes a
triple-a battery so I'm gonna play with
this I might even do a video on this
just cuz I'm like skeptical City over
here but that actually sounds really
cool so I will I might plan to do a
separate video on this let you guys know
does it work like I always say my skin
is dry maybe it's not maybe they're like
yeah a hundred percent moisture there
girl oh but that's really really cool
something that I feel like I wouldn't
bought for myself but I'm excited to
play with it let's keep going so next
thing in here is this Vasanti brighten
up enzymatic face rejuvenator it's an
exfoliating cleanser enriched with
papaya microcrystals and aloe 99%
natural ingredients gives radiance it
exfoliates with dermatologist grade
micro crystals that's good
so yeah you just put it on and rinse it
off paraben free sulfate free vegan
friendly so this is $29 this is the
science says it gives you glowing skin
so I'll try please so that's really nice
Vasanti can be expensive obviously $29
that's I think pricey but that's pretty
cool and that was one where you had
options you could have also gotten like
a loop resistance band or a little like
cute wallet all right let's keep a-goin
the next thing this is an SPF perfect
for summer cooler I really like Kula
brand SPF sand products anything I've
tried from them I'm always like this
really nice I've never gotten sunburned
ever using this this is their sport
sunscreen SPF of 50 it says it's got
white tea
it's a moisturizer so Oh it's for your
face only yes I love having space
specific SPF because I feel like when I
use body ones on my skin sometimes I put
on my face it just kind of clogs my
pores it makes it look crazy greasy
often times when they're meant for your
face they tend to not be quite as greasy
I don't know about this one but that is
really nice and this retails for $32
they are not cheap 80-minute water
resistant formula made with 70% organic
ingredients
awesome so very excited about that next
thing in here ooh this sounds nice it's
the Brandis aromatherapy associates
London and it's $39 and it's this
de-stress muscle Joe so it says made
with an invigorating blend of essential
oils this best-selling muscle gel
instantly cools aches and soothes tired
muscles over time ooh it even says use
it on your neck like if your necks just
sore I feel like my calves are always
sore I might wait until I'm not pregnant
like I don't think I can use like icy
hot or bengay right now so this is
probably not yeah not recommended during
pregnancy so I'll have to wait a little
while but that sounds awesome
that really does and again it's a
full-size so it's expensive this was
another one where you could have gotten
this or a cute little ring or this black
lava bat body caviar anyway okay
geez there's so much in here that's what
always blows my mind here's a straw okay
it says this straw saves marine life I
think it's one of those like paper
straws that's awesome so this next one
is from Elemis it's their papaya enzyme
peel another exfoliator is it for your
body for your face yeah it's for your
face so now I've got two that's maybe
overkill on the enzymatic peels I mean
that's just kind of funny that I got too
so this again was another option one is
this or the hair protectant treatment
spray so I feel like they should have
like I don't know split that up a little
differently but regardless cool I will
definitely try it and this is $45
alright last thing in here this one is
so cute I picked em it's from Pier one
Imports
and it is I want to see how much they're
charging that's not yeah that's still
kind of expensive
it's this little rain dish for rings or
whatever it almost looks like a coaster
but it does kind of bevel in a little
bit so I don't know I mean you probably
could use it as a coaster but it's $15
and yeah just kind of a catch-all little
small tray is it this pretty though it's
got the little gold around it so that's
part of why I really like fabfitfun I
feel like there's always something cute
for the home in there to like sometimes
it'll be a reed diffuser for aroma or
you know things like that that I'm like
I would never well I mean I might have
bought it for myself but it's night it's
like a gift for yourself and that's why
I like it okay so how is everything in
this box certainly over three hundred
dollars I am sure yeah it says total
value depending on what you selected is
between three hundred twenty one dollars
and three hundred sixty seven dollars so
you know obviously when you're choosing
the things sometimes some of them are
more expensive so really cool and you
know what as I'm saying this out loud I
think this would be a cool gift like if
you were to buy just one box for you
know your sister or your mom or
something like that mother's days come
and gone of course but it's it's it's
just cool it's fun and exciting so I
hope you enjoyed this I love doing
unboxings I don't do them all the time
on my channel anymore I pretty
I do like my Sephora $10 monthly
subscription which is fun I still do
that that's pretty much it right now I
might do boxycharm again I kinda miss it
but and then I do fabfitfun usually
quarterly so like I said $10 off code is
jammed beauty the link is below if
you're curious to give it a try or just
to check it out and think about it
or if you know again I always try to
remind you you don't need everything you
see on YouTube so don't feel like
because I had box this and loved it
means you need to order it you know
decide for yourself I hope you'll
subscribe if you enjoyed and I'll see
