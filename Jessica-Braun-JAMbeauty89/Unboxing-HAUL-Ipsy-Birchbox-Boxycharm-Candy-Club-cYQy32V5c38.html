unboxing for different subscription
boxes
I've got epsy and Birchbox and boxycharm
and candy club this video is actually
sponsored by candy club I have done one
maybe two I think just one video with
them before I just think it's an awesome
company I think it's such a fun idea for
a subscription box I'll put info about
all of these boxes below but we'll start
with candy club they have a subscription
of course but you can also do it where
you choose which candies you want each
time you get the box and so I was able
to now that I've gotten some candy clubs
in the past I was able to go on and pick
some of my favorites and I am so excited
to show you what I think because I'm
freaking love candy alright let's dig in
I also have a promo code for this I will
put on the screen right now as I'm
talking but I'll also put it below if
you're interested in saving some money
when you order one of these so the boxes
are always so cute oh my gosh these are
all my babies so first of all they
always have like just random candy like
candy like strewn throughout which I
just think it's cute but so oh my gosh
so say they have a little card they also
have the nutrition facts which is
actually kind of cool so the Toffees
that are strewn throughout first of all
smells so good I need a candle that
smells like toffee they're primrose
brand assorted Toffees let's try the
butter rum good this is what I'm gonna
bring into work because those are so
good and when you have a sweet tooth but
you you're like I'm not gonna go eat a
Reese's like that's a lot this is the
perfect thing that's just satisfying
creamy sweet and just so good that was
amazing
alright so here let's dig into the three
things that I picked out because I love
them so much so the first thing is the
finis red Nordic fish I love you so much
they're like swedish fish in a way I
mean that's the idea and they come in
these cute jars and you take the plastic
off
oh my gosh you have never had these
kinds of candies like Swedish fish type
candy they're unlike anything I've ever
had I remember the first time I ever had
them I was like what is this like how if
I got my whole life without having them
the next thing I picked out were these
just born Mike and Ike tropical typhoon
mixture so I love Mike and Ikes and I
especially love like I don't love the
original flavors I really like when it's
like a mixture like this like the
tropical first of all these are so cute
and they'd be perfect like you're having
a dinner party or something with just
friends you could just have these out
people didn't just grab and go I think
that's so fun oh my gosh I'm trying the
blue such a kid mmm so sweet and sour
all right those are of course incredible
the last thing that I picked out are
called the door vol or Dorval sour power
strawberry belts if you've seen one of
my past candy club unboxing videos I got
something I don't know if they were the
exact ones there's something very
similar they were these sour belts
they're so good and I have my husband
Tyler try one and he was like oh my gosh
we need to get these out of the house
these are too good but they're just
these I mean like literal belt like
things I'm just stuffing inland hmm oh
my gosh they're so sour I love it I know
I don't look like I do but I do oh these
are so good if you like sour you will
freaking love these they're so like it's
like an aftershock um I might want one
more they're so weirdly good where
you're like ah it's so sour but then you
finish it and you're like oh I want
another one like because they're kind of
crunchy but they're they're just so good
this is so good I know I'm gonna crash
so hard from the sugar rush I'm about to
be on but those are so good
let's get into the other boxes so I've
got MC Birchbox and boxycharm as well as
I mentioned let's start with FC the
theme is glamazon in the back
is actually really really cute and I
love that it's gold like metallic gold
um
she's kind of cute these are $10 a month
whoa the first thing is a Tarte product
it's the hardest lash paint kinda want
to open it I'm just gonna open it I
usually don't with mascaras but I want
to cuz a whoa oh no did I pull it all
out or am i cool oh it looks like I
pulled the whole thing out um I don't
know why I just smell this it smells
like mascara but it's got like a really
big wand but it's all rubbery and very
spiky so I'm very curious to give this a
try and I've noticed a lot of times with
these like deluxe sized samples they
last just as long before they dry out as
a regular sized mascara does just saying
next thing in here is this bellapierre
cosmetics mineral blush and autumn glow
I already love it bellapierre made one
of my favorite lip glosses I haven't had
it in so long I don't remember do you
guys remember what it was called some of
you guys that are true blue Jessica
Braun subscribers that have been around
for a while you'll probably know exactly
what it's called if you can remember it
oh it's called like shortcake like
vanilla shortcake or something like that
was so good anyway so this blush let's
swatch it it is of course like a it
looks very golden let me like get some
indigo like it looks very peachy golden
so it can almost be used as like a
highlighter I almost think because if it
looks like a highlighter on me it's
gonna look like a highlighter on like
every one so yeah there it is right
there if you can see it it's very light
so I don't necessarily think you could
use this as a true blush it would just
be very very glowy but it's really
pretty so I'll still use it but I think
I'll use it I'll put it in my
highlighter drawer cute and that is
definitely full size which is always
awesome next thing in here is this brush
what is it
crown brush brush and it looks like it's
like a blush one maybe kind of feels
flimsy to be honest with you I mean I
don't know like for what it is it
doesn't feel very nice so but I like
it's got like an ergonomic handle where
it's got like indentions where your
fingers might go when you're applying it
which is always nice but I'm just not
very impressed with the top and there's
some an uneven hairs just sticking out
but the under two products I really like
though next one this is Brio geo Rio Geo
I never know how to say it don't despair
repair deep conditioning mask no
parabens silicones or phthalates
phthalates it's got a avocados sweet
almond ooh argan oil a bunch of other
stuff reduces breakage by up to 81%
after 3 uses Wow
so I like the idea do you rinse it out
let's see it says leave in for 5 to 10
minutes before rinsing so you do rinse
it out but it says for even deeper
conditioning cover the hair in a plastic
cap while sitting under the dryer for 20
minutes
that's funny then rinse trying to
picture like unless I'm holding a
blow-dryer and I'll own like a dryer
dryer that would just be awesome alright
last thing in here is looks like it's
been nail polish a lot it's all wrapped
up red and it's the Ulta three nail
color is it by uLTA Beauty no it doesn't
say but it does say Ulta three not ultra
I'm assuming it's like ultimate tight
cuz it doesn't yeah it's not from Ulta
anyway it's been sizzling red it looks
really pretty let's kind of see if it's
opaque just on the it looks semi opaque
it looks like you you can still see the
brush quite a bit so I feel like you
might need two maybe three coats but it
looks like a pretty red some Reds look
weird I think on my nails so that's
awesome it's definitely full sized so
that was pretty good for
hypsi not my favorite but I still think
it was pretty good I'm just really not
impressed with that brush to be honest
but again it's $10
the next thing is the Birchbox was here
just recently Reece absque Ribe - and
it's got its info cards this fall's
around the corner
we're jumping into multitasking mode
time saving products buh-bye alright yes
yes yes so the first thing I saw was
this chlorine dry shampoo I have tried
this before and it is so good and a lot
of people rave about it and it is kind
of pricey for the full size compared to
just you know any other dry shampoo in
the drugstore but it really is good it
really is good I'm excited to try this
again and I'm always looking for dry
shampoos in travel-size cuz I use that
so much when I travel because you don't
always necessarily have as much time as
you want to get ready when you're
traveling so this is a lifesaver that is
awesome
the full-size is $20 next thing in here
is this dr. brandt pores no more
cleanser i thought it was a primer i
think they have a primer called that as
well the full size is 36 that this of
course is deluxe sized it's a best
selling face wash that minimizes pores
and leave skin clean fresh and velvety
smooth so again nice travel size booboo
this is that milk makeup brand I've
never tried anything from them this is
their bomb a mascara and originally it's
$24 I don't think this is the full size
has a unique triple ball applicator this
mascara is infused with obama oak I hope
I'm saying that right charcoal and
Sapphire dust Wow for added volume and
an ultra dark color so I'm so intrigued
very excited to try this this next one
is by lock or LOC which is love of color
it's their ultra gloss lip pencil and
cherry bomb for $12 by kit there we go
oooh oh I don't know how to describe
this this is really good it it was
really creamy but it is glossy but it's
still really thick and opaque I don't I
never had a pencil quite like this I
don't know how to describe it if you got
one of these you might know what I mean
it was like thick but creamy but glossy
but in a pencil usually it might be
maybe glossy but it's not thick and
opaque like this this is really nice so
I'm excited to actually try this out Wow
the last thing in here is this air
repair complexion boost
moisturizer with hyaluronic acid and
this one retails for 21 dollars for the
full-size it's a rich cream moisturizes
and revitalize draw dry dull
stressed-out skin I could use that right
now I feel like my skin is kind of dry
awesome we'll definitely give this a try
so I think I might have liked this one
better than Ipsy this month just because
I'm really excited about the chlorine
dry shampoo I'm really excited about
this lip product and then I'm also
excited to try this milk mascara the
other two I will use but I'm not like
overly excited about but I like this a
little bit more than if see this month
the last one is boxycharm the other two
or $10 this one's 21 so it is a little
bit more expensive but they usually have
mostly full size which is always kind of
nice so the theme is camp glam I'm
actually going camping with some friends
here in a couple weeks and October let's
go glamping pack your hiking heels and
get ready to glam in style let's see so
the first thing Wow is a butter LONDON
nail polish full-size and these are like
14 I bet it even says yeah $15 for this
size it's called yummy mummy and it's a
really pretty neutral like this is so
perfect for fall if you don't like like
dark berries or darker colors on your
nails this is the other way you can go
and it is so pretty so so excited about
that the next thing it's really big is
this project beauty hair Girt like
yogurt a hair curd strawberry banana ooh
it's a hair mask this one retails for
$11.50 and then rinse it I might try
this one next just because I'm excited
about the scent and I like that it's a
bigger size so I can really get some use
out of it let's open it let's just see
what it smells like oh my gosh it smells
like strawberry and banana oh my gosh it
smells so good there's something else
that reminds me of it I can't quite put
my finger on it
anyway I'm using like I'm gonna put this
right into my shower I'm so excited
about that
these your I think everything is
full-size this time around this is the
pure lip lure hydrating lip lacquer and
these retail for $22 so let's see the
shade is actually it'll probably the
shade is then mystic I think yeah I've
tried these before and I really liked
him it's got the kind of you have to
twist up so just give me a moment while
they twist it up but it's like a hard
applicator but it's like fuzzy I think
that was the only thing I remembered not
liking about it cuz I've had one or
maybe even two of these before they were
it was a really nice moment I didn't
love that the applicator was kind of
hard because it was just kind of weird
to apply it this is such a pretty color
though again for fall so pretty
so and it's creamy and kind of gloss
like but not quite a gloss it really is
pretty so I'm gonna give this another
chance cuz I mean the applicator isn't
that bad I just for some reason I just
didn't love it the next thing in here is
it's bigger again it looks like a pallet
and it is their studio makeup on the go
i shadow palettes got names of all these
I'm excited it's got names of all these
different cities it's a combination of
shades that updates the bear Beauty look
with the cosmopolitan attitude with this
travel sized palette you can create
pretty urban making makeup look and go
studio today tonight oh my gosh oh my
gosh look at these shades if you're a
neutral girl you're probably drooling
right now these are the most perfect
neutral shades oh my gosh they're so
creamy look at that oh my gosh this is
better than I anticipated hold on let's
watch some more of these let's watch
this really shimmery one there's that
one I'm gonna wipe off my fingers as I
go let's watch some of the matte ones
that can be very oh okay it's much
better on my finger there's the dark
brown let's try the black so these
aren't as creamy they're still really
pigmented but they're not quite as like
Sookie as the shimmery ones but I am
really excited this really is a good
combo like I feel like this is the
perfect palette to bring with you if
you're bringing one other maybe colorful
palette while you're traveling this is
the perfect
pan Yin because it's got everything else
you could ever need if the palette
you're using is missing it so oh my gosh
that's amazing so love that and the
retail for that is $50 what it is pretty
nice though oh my gosh so I really do I
think that's really really nice the
brand is Studio makeup by the way and
I've never heard of them but that is
really nice so the last thing in here is
by Hikari and it's their Raven eyeliner
the shade is Raven this one retails for
thirteen dollars this is the full size
it's a mechanical eyeliner pencil
alright so it's just a mechanical black
liner seems really really creamy in
black so again I always use black liner
and I use them up so I'm excited about
that one I mean that one was awesome
again it's hard to compare boxycharm to
Ipsy and Birchbox
because price-wise they're just
different but that was pretty amazing oh
my gosh I'm really excited but that
freaking $50 palette so that was
