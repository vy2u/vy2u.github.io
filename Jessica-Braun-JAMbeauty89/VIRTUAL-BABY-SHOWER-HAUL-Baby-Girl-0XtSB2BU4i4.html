having my virtual baby shower so so many
of you guys I'd asked on snapchat etc if
you guys wanted me to share some of the
things that you guys have sent us both
from our baby registry but mostly even
to our like peel box just sweet things
you guys saw or made or whatever and
overwhelmingly you guys said yes so I
figured I would show all these things
now I'm gonna let you know right now
this room is a mess you can't see it
obviously I've hidden it because we you
know we've got a long ways to go with
our nursery we still have I'm 26 almost
27 weeks pregnant oh my gosh and with
that in mind I mean we just said we
haven't had like our family baby shower
and those kinds of things so but
overwhelmingly we are so grateful to you
guys and we've just felt you know I
guess I don't know how to put it into
words because I've never gone through
something like this in life you know
getting married is scary and exciting
but not in the same way having a baby is
because you know this is obviously our
first and it's just it's scary and
exciting and there's no turning back and
there you know what I mean like it's
like wow and so I know that so many of
you guys get that feeling and I think
that's where a lot of you guys is just
your generosity has come from because
you know that feeling of like you don't
know what you need and you don't know
where to begin because if you start
searching online you know I've watched
videos I've read blogs and I'm like oh
my gosh
so many conflicting ideas on everything
out there specifically just products
like things you use so I'm excited to
show you I am gonna guarantee you this
will be a long video and I also have a
feeling because I know we need to check
our Peele box
and we've gotten a couple shipment
updates I have a feeling we might need
to do a part two to this just in the
future maybe in a few weeks maybe in a
month but I just want to show it to you
guys I couldn't wait any longer I didn't
want to wait any longer so the first few
things going to show you I don't
remember the subscribers name and I feel
horrible because I snapped about it and
I usually save the snaps and I didn't
save this snap and so first of all look
at this adorable little onesie kind of a
thing
it says a tale as old as time thank you
so much it's so so cute this Tyler was
so excited about we both love beating
the beast he always says that I am his
bell and so this I mean on top of the
fact that we are absolutely Disney crazy
and he's a Disney travel agent we love
it and then also look at this little bow
it's got it looks like kind of makes me
think of like Snow White
oh my gosh and then this sweet little
owl hat it's just a little thing stuck
it up I know I'm trying to like not use
our dog Pinocchio's voice that we've
made up I can't help it and I'm trying
to break it because when this baby comes
out I don't want to like I don't want
her to talk like we talked to Pinocchio
anyway I've got a lot of issues I need
to work through so thank you so much
another subscriber Nakia sent us this
beagle that she made and it is named I
hope said Gemini jiminy
as in Jiminy Cricket since our peoples
name is Pinocchio and this is supposed
to be this little girl our little girls
little friend look at his big beegley
ears it's so sweet so this is actually
been sitting up on our dresser and I
think it's probably gonna stay there for
awhile it's just I just adore thank you
so much the white stuff is so sweet oh
speaking of homemade
this back here a subscriber Annette made
us and it is literally the colors of our
nursery perfectly a lot of people when
you're having a girl a lot of people do
you know like light pink gray white well
us too because we love it and so that is
from her and I think it is so so
beautiful too so so soft thank you so
much um next is from Laura and she sent
these to her peal box look at this the
original Mouseketeer size is this trying
to get a feel for like what sizes we
need more of cuz I know like my family's
been asking this is zero to three month
oh my gosh I know she said she got these
on the Disney website cuz they just have
cute stuff on there and then oh my gosh
one of my faves
little crown big dreams little tutu I
think that's the same size oh three or
six months nice thank you so much those
that made our hearts so so happy and
then melody sent us this really sweet
Minnie and Mickey little t-shirts or
sweet Pinocchio hold on come on
cuz I've been talking on your voice too
ma'am oh no not copper
Robert says all come here we're beagles
sitting oh you can't see him and we've
got to be gold stepping on one is named
copper as in like for pops in the Hound
that's Pinocchio's buddy and then we've
got Pinocchio slowly come here buddy
he says I'm Pinocchio I'm who she's
talking about he says I just oh he's
huge
no copper don't kid if you guys could
see the floor you would be like no get
out of your peoples go on Beagle buddies
Harris they have such a love-hate
relationship they love each other they
hate each other so much Garrett does
that all you came in to tell me all
right continuing on I'm drinking my like
half CAF coffee it's just not quite the
same see that's another thing like
conflicting views I'm like being
pregnant and caffeine like my doctor's
like two cups of coffee is fine you know
a day so what I usually do is I just do
like half CAF cups um but it's just so
funny cuz then other people like no you
shouldn't have any caffeine I'm like mad
so my doctor Joyce oh it's just so
interesting you can't there's no one
side to any anything in life ELISA sent
us this book Tyler picked this one out
your baby's first word will be dad at
and he loves Jimmy Fallon so this meant
even more to him but it really is so so
cute and then she also said these sweet
little little little little little
mermaid little bath toys they're so cute
and a lot of you guys gave us great
advice that the little holes you know
that the water can get in so that it
doesn't grow mold you can put like glue
in there like super glue so we might try
that just because you'll see we got a
lot of little bath toys like this and I
didn't know that ya mean I hope I'm
saying your beautiful name right um sent
this I'm not allowed to date ever and a
little it comes with cute little socks
and a cute little bow headband I I would
dispo'ed van so that thank you so much
adorable that's a six-month one and then
Deborah sent us this safety bathtime
it's like a kneeler and it comes it kind
of folds over the tub I just thought
this was kind of cool it folds over the
top and you can kind of stick like quick
items that you need while you're bathing
cuz you know obviously this is a older
kid but I think even when they're
younger and you're starting to give the
bass in the actual tub or even like with
the thing I think this would just be
kind of nice to have do I think it's
absolutely necessary maybe not but we
registered for it cuz we were like that
might just be nice we both have really
bad knees - so anyway and then she also
sent Minnie Mouse little baths bath
squirt toys oh my gosh so many Disney
toys I love it okay Kristiana sent us we
need tons of these so this was awesome
little outlet plugs that like little
caps you put on your outlets that aren't
being used we a lot of outlets in our
home that are not being used and so for
this I'm like this is actually really
really nice and really really useful
awesome very very useful I even remember
when I was a kid my mom had these in
most of the outlets so Victoria sent us
everything is mama by Jimmy Fallon so I
thought oh that is perfect so we can
both when you read store you can read
the dad I wanna migrate do it I'll read
them on my one and we'll just see what
her first word is it'll end up being
like poop like yep that sounds right so
very very excited about that one on a
personal level and then also we'd
registered for these Burt's babies
little washcloths so it's just a little
three pack they're not and I even read
this in the reviews when I was
registering they're not as soft as other
washcloths but I've heard that just the
material and they're made up they just
really hold up well through multiple
washes etc and they are made through
from organic cotton which they say is
better I don't know but I loved the
light pink and white and I was like
they're just I just love them so loved
that and then she also sent us Finding
Nemo bath squirt toys
next up Mary sent us this halo sleep
sack these are like the be-all end-all
of sleep Saxon I did not realize and
this is just sad the owner I was reading
the back of this the other day when he
opened it and the owner had lost his
daughter to SIDS and that's why he you
know kind of made it his life mission to
make things that are safe for her babies
to sleep in so I was like just like
wrenches your heart so these are super
popular nowadays because I mean for that
reason they're cozy they're comfy you
know babies don't really need their legs
separated to sleep because they're not
crawling they're not walking you know
when you're putting them in these
typically so I really like this this is
one that's like a little vest one so
it's like cut off here so they got their
little arms and this one is the size
small when I was registering for all
these little sleeping things I'm like
how many small so I need how many
mediums I don't know like it doesn't say
months I don't know so I was just kind
of doing a guessing game there and just
will just see how it all plays out but
it's so cute and of course it says back
is best is what they say I trust the
people that know better than I do this
is from Ashley and it's the Lion King
book um we oh my gosh
just come on it's just so cute I love
the Lion King and these are so well made
they're like really nice hard backs and
we have some books there you can see
like some little board books and things
cuz I figured this is the chair like
when I'm in here and might be nursing in
we'll see we also have a rocking chair
there but we also have a bookshelf we
just bought from Ikea that'll be
anchored to the wall it's like a
changing table bookshelf kind of hybrid
and so when that I'm I'm gonna try to
build it Tyler was like are you sure you
want to build it like I can do it it's
for Mikey and the directions from Ikea
things are like really hard to
understand anyway so I'm gonna build
that darn bookshelf and once I put it up
I think that I think that's where a lot
of the books will probably live
especially ones for when she's a little
bit older oh I love it this is from
Phyllis so these little it's 12 little
board books and it's Mickey Mouse
Clubhouse and so one size is shapes
picnic time I can't read all the rest of
them but oh they're on the back counting
animals roadtrip helping hands so really
really cute
a little handle and I thought it would
it just be so awesome I'm a teacher so
I'm all for reading I mean guys come on
who's not all for reading I know but so
it's like I just I just get so excited I
freaking love books so much but she also
sent toes ears the nose lifts the flat
book oh my gosh any books where there's
a flap to lift I'm like oh yeah I would
have loved that as a kid do I predict
some of these will get ripped yes but in
the meantime it will be awesome and then
a personal favorite love you forever my
mommy used to read this to me when I was
younger and I love it if you've never
read this story it's like
heart-wrenching it's so sweet
and then lift the flap first 100 words
so again you can lift the flap for all
of these I just love books like this I
think they're so cool what a fun way to
learn words Maria sent us this Melissa
and Doug letter puzzle box so as she
gets a little bit older by like a lot a
bit older we register for some things
like this because you're like you know
what these will be so cool and they
can't she can't use it for a while but
we figure we'll just keep him safely
away in her closet until we can but it's
a little self-correcting letter so she
has to match the letter to the you know
whatever the word is that it should
start with I'm excited to play with this
so thank you so much wait I'm excited
play with it
okay some baby toiletries I did do a lot
of research in like what products to use
rabies not like stuff but like skin
products and stuff and there's a lot of
good stuff out there a lot of natural
brands a lot of mainstream brands that
are still really really good so in my
research what I ended up registering for
and these are all from these are all
from Natasha and we were so excited
opening these I was showing these head
I'm like and this one's good for this
and this is good but it's the Aveeno
baby wash and shampoo and then the
lotion I know my skin reacts really well
to Aveeno products especially you know a
lot of theirs have oats in them really
really well i-i've had flare-ups even
during this pregnancy and that's the
only thing the Aveeno body wash is the
only thing that calmed it down so I've
read really good things about these and
then on top of the fact that it works
well with my skin too I figured that
might be a good bet so I registered for
a couple of these that's so awesome I
all
registered for an Aveeno hand cream
because I figure gosh even right now my
hands are so dry I want to put some on
just to have at her you know diaper
changing station or in like a little
diaper bag just because we're gonna be
washing her hands so much you know much
more than you usually do if you're not a
mom or dad maybe and after all those
diaper changes I figured it'd be nice to
have some nice hand cream just sitting
there to be able to throw on also some
earth mama organic nipple butter how
exciting I've heard this stuff is the
best and I was weirdly excited to open
this it's just an organic one and I've
just heard it's it's like the be-all
end-all there are a lot of good ones out
there I also my sister gave me the
lanolin from whatever that brand is and
I'm sure that's good too I don't know I
mean I haven't needed it yet but
assuming I will I was really excited to
have that to try because I've heard it's
so amazing
water wipes I've heard that when you're
in the hospital when there's that young
you don't want to use just regular wipes
on them I haven't done a lot of research
I just kind of read that a couple times
so I've heard water wipes are pretty
decent and gentle to use at that time so
we just I think I only registered for
maybe one just to throw in our hospital
bag just in case and then some baby
Ganic this brand is very very highly
loved baby Kanaks hand and face wipes
and an alcohol-free foaming hand
sanitizer people talk very highly about
this
so I registered for some bigger ones
with a pump to have at the changing
table but also smaller ones like this to
have an inner diaper bag purse whatever
so Oh awesome
awesome stuff that I'm so excited to try
eventually next thing is from show pond
I hope I'm saying your name right um
look it's Pooh Bear doesn't everyone
just like want a classic Pooh he's so
soft
he's from the Disney baby line and I
mean he's so soft and squishy he's just
so cute he actually looks really cute I
had him sitting here before the video
and then I pulled him down to talk about
him and show him but so so sweet I just
love it my mom in her we have a lot of
nieces and nephews my parents have a lot
of grandkids and she has in their little
like kids playroom area well I think she
has all of the winnie pooh character
in plush form she's just kind of built
her collection over the years and I just
think it's so sweet so these are from
Anastasia and love that name
she sent us some of the beautiful
washcloths we registered for as well
those same Burt's Bees ones cuz we
figure we'll need quite a bit and I'm so
so excited they're so cute and then this
little newbie teeth ease which I don't
know do you like freeze this I maybe not
freeze it
I've heard of some that you can like
refrigerate so it's cold I don't did I
don't think this is I don't think that's
the thing but it soothes and cleans gums
it's got two different sides and like
that is so perfect and I love that it
was pink and then these lands - no
that's the brand of the lanolin my
sister gave me lansinoh but these are
the three and one breast therapy you can
do them hot or cold and just kind of
have him in there for some relief and I
thought that sounds amazing so I'm just
like really mentally preparing for the
worst cuz I've heard such horror stories
so I was very excited to have these and
obviously you reuse these things like
that at least say thank you reuse them
yeah they're reusable so very who I'm
sure will be very loved and very used so
thank you okay the next one is from Mary
and she lives in Evansville actually
there he opened something from her some
of these got like mixed around but it's
so classic isn't it I had a piece as a
kid even Tyler terms like oh yeah those
are classic so it's six months plus but
you know you kind of stack the things
and oh my gosh it's just such a classic
toy I was like dude we have to have that
for like you have to have it it's like a
rite of passage so I'm so excited it
just it just makes my heart happy every
time I see it oh baby stuff this is also
from Ashley she's the one that sent the
Lion King book this just got mixed in
look at this my little black dress it's
got a little tutu to her little diaper
but in there this is the three months
sighs oh my gosh I this is so freaking
cute so these two are from a subscriber
named Audra she sent the Disney baby
little like sleep sack
it's so cute again it's got the arms
kind of exposed but then otherwise it's
just sip so it can kind of kick around
in it
it's got a little Minnie Mouse on there
it's so so cute and then she also sent
this a little ducky like hooded towel
isn't it so cute I really like this too
so I'm so excited about both of those
just so adorable thank you
this is also from show pond again I hope
I'm saying your name right um so this oh
my gosh look at these little headbands
they're so so cute I love that you can
just mix and match style and little baby
so I loved these I loved it there are
some stripes and polka dots some floral
and then some plain colors and then also
this is probably Tyler's I always I
don't know that he has a favorite he
loves Paris I love Paris too it's where
we spent our honeymoon we just loved it
he really liked these Bonjour baby and
then there's like a little bow there
just all kinds of signs so it's five
different body suits these are extra
large nine to twelve because I figured
we've got a lot of like newborn stuff I
guess not too much I think we've kind of
balanced it out and what you guys have
been sending has been pretty balanced
which is just awesome but it's so so
cute oh my gosh this is from a
subscriber named Katie and she said this
was one of her favorite books to the
rainbow fish do you guys remember this
as a kid I remember it I loved loved
loved this story so I'm so excited again
to get all of the books together so a
subscriber named Terry sent us some of
the bub EULA plastic bags that would go
with the trash can it's like a diaper
pail we registered for we haven't bought
it yet but I mean that's the one we're
planning on using um just because you
didn't I hope what did the lady say it
by our baby she was like you don't have
to it's not quite the same as a diaper
genie
it's a little bit easier to use but the
way that you put it into the trash can
is the inventive part not the fact that
they're all in like little individual
twisted bags whatever so but anyway I am
so excited so I'm like well that's good
because this is gonna force us to get
the one we really want so we'll just
have to go out and actually buy it you
know I am really really excited about
that
another one from Mary who lives here in
Indiana like we do she sent these little
sacking cups that she said she added
because she knows babies in her life
have loved them and then these little
key rings that's so cute
baby's just holding it and shaking it
around oh my gosh uh I'm overwhelmed I
cannot wait to meet this little ding
dong in there I cannot wait she's gonna
be crazy she's gonna either crazy brown
curly hair Todd and I both have brown
hair so like she'd probably have brown
hair but I guess there's still a chance
but when he was born he had like white
hair and when I was born I had red hair
and then you know as you just get older
your anyway this is from Christina and
she said she works at byebye baby and
this bottle is her registered
registrants favorite she at the plastic
is hospital-grade I hope you like them
it's the juvie brand boob yes both Tyler
and I giggled Sonny's in the store but
that it that sounds awesome we have some
bottles we only have one brand and so my
fear we ended up registering I added one
more brand on there cuz I'm like you
know what in case she doesn't like one
versus the other versus the other it'll
be kind of nice to already have them
especially in those early weeks if we
need to use them so really excited about
that now I will take anyone's Inc
expertise because I don't know what I
don't know you know she also sent this
little junior bib which is a mini my own
yes that's already open a little Minnie
Mouse big that has like the little
pocket oh my gosh and it's light pink
I'm just like yes and then also that
same like Lion King book the Aladdin one
and you know what is awesome we didn't
register for any of the three things she
sent and we adore all of them because
again you guys if you've had kids you
know different things that work well or
if you like work in a place where you
would know and then she just knew that
we met doing the show
Aladdin so it's like extra special so
that was very very thoughtful thank you
so so much
subscriber Phoebe sent us and actually
these are the first ones we got I'm just
like in a crazy order right now the
Aveeno body wash and the Aveeno lotion
again I'm so excited I love that these
have a pump because I feel like it just
gonna be really quick to just go choo
choo choo and um you know throw it all
over her little baby's skin and I don't
know I just love it so a subscriber
Christina sent us these oXXO tot little
snack cups we registered for this
is amazing because you know if you tip
it upside down most likely nothing will
fall out I mean maybe little tiny crumbs
these are pretty highly rated too so I
was very excited about that and then
Anna sent us a weapon above the one that
looks like a doggy beagle but we've got
acute so very excited about that because
I've heard really good things about
these just the idea that they're easier
for them to grab and hold and you know
it's extra special cuz there's a little
tiny stuff de animal basically attached
to it so I think that's pretty cool
and then Maria sent us this hello world
Paris a book of shapes is it shapes yeah
and so it goes through and it talks
about different places in Paris that
have different shapes night Tyler and I
are both like oh my gosh this is amazing
and then on the in that same line
Johanna sent us these two so San
Francisco which is a book of numbers and
then London which is the book of
opposites so literally all three of
these together thank you guys so much
cuz these are just like freaking
adorable little series I wish they have
like every single city in the world
okay my husband just came in and gave me
a snack of some apples and cheese and
crackers that was very very sweet I'm
always hungry Oh a subscriber named Jen
sent us a couple things so she sent this
sophie the Giraffe Lajja raff a little
teether
these things are freaking like not cheap
and people talk so highly about them as
like the best either in the world Tyra
are both like what so we had to register
because we're like I just want like I
want to know will she just adore it's
adorable little giraffe so and again
it's got the little Eiffel Tower so we
were like okay now we really feel so
thank you so much I'm so intrigued by
this then she also sent the aerial
little bath toys she's gonna have so
many toys to play with in the bath it's
gonna be so fun when she gets old enough
to like you know and then she also sent
this little pack of Minnie Mouse they're
so cute
I love how they're just bright fun pink
and just little minis on each one love
it alright a subscriber named winter
love that name sent us a bunch of little
like Kid Flash toddler slash baby hang
like 1 2 3 4 5 packs like yes because we
have a few but we don't have many and
obviously as she gets more and more
close it's like ok we actually need like
small hangers not our giant adult human
hangers so very very useful thank you
and then she also sent us some more of
those outlet plugs we are gonna be set
thank you and then a little book and a
head pass Ygritte these they had really
cute designs on where you just kind of
clip it to their clothes their car seat
you know whatever and then the other
part is just attached to any pacifier so
I liked that it was more universal
because like if she's obsessed with her
little woman up and it needs to be
washed or you know whatever be nice to
have other options of things that aren't
gonna be lost as easily or drop to the
floor etc so very excited and I loved
the little gray and white like Chevron
and then also these spoons looked so
cool so they're the newbie brand and
they're hot safe spoons so you know
they're really long easy to feed with
and they turn white at the tip if it's
too hot whatever the food is that you're
feeding them so I thought that sounds
amazing so very excited about all that
stuff thank you so much ok I had to show
these we had kind of talked about we're
like we know with this we didn't want a
necessary show stuff our families
already gotten us like over the past few
months it was a little overwhelming if I
added that on top but these were just
recently sent to us from my lovely
sister-in-law share and my brother
Michael and one of them is this little
car seat cover it's black and white
stripes and it's like elastic and it's
thinner cuz she's gonna be born late
made so you know it will be warm out and
I thought this is so nice and it doubles
as a lot of different things so I
thought that was really really cool and
then also these eight men and I muslin
swaddle blankets and their Disney you
guys their Disney there's like little
minis on one of them little bows on
another I was just like oh my gosh
totally sold and I was so excited and
they also got us this little um I'll
have to take a picture of it and insert
it it's already on our crib but it's a
little lamb what do you call that like
mobile that goes around in a place
Brahms Lullaby and so I thought it's
I love it but I'll probably do if you
guys are interested like a separate like
baby shower when we have like our family
baby shower I'll probably do a video on
that we'll see and we'll see how I'm
feeling like as we get closer and closer
to you know actually having the baby I
don't know that all have the energy or
not we'll just see but if so then I
might get so a couple more books we've
got the giving tree by shel silverstein
steamed Stein um I love this book as a
kid um this is from Giada and oh my gosh
this book is so special again it's
another one that if you've never read it
you have to it's such a special book and
then Gina read she might have sent some
other stuff that we'll see in a minute

useful and then Emma another subscriber
sent and I think she's a subscriber both
of our channels um this sweet little
like lamb hooded touts
thank you so much oh I can't wait to see
it on her
oh I need that feeling of like knowing
she's there I had a moment last night
I'm so emotional we were laying in bed
and you know I feel her kick all the
time and Tyler started but he's been
able to feel her and there was something
about I had my hand like up here and she
it was such a hard kick or push or
whatever it was that you could like see
it and I could really feel like and
there's something about it I instantly
tears just roll down my face cuz I'm
like oh my gosh like this is like that
is a real little tiny human in there
that's just growing and growing now I'm
getting the motion I need the windshield
wipers but just it's so overwhelming and
weird and cool um I just can't wait to
meet her love and once you consult ok I
gotta hold it together oh this is also
from Gina there we go it's this number
puzzle so we had the alphabet ones and
then this is the number version where
they have to match the numbers with the
actual like amount and a picture
I love it I love learning toys this is
from Terry gripe water again highly
highly rated so it says it relieves
occasional stomach discomfort from gas
colic fussiness hiccups it doesn't have
any dyes no alcohol no parabens so again
it's herbal I've heard amazing things
about it so I'm so excited to receive it
because I'm like I just want to know you
know when those things are striking my
babe will it help so again I'll have to
let you know overtime but I'm very
excited to try that so this these items
are from a subscriber named Millie and
oh my gosh so many I got it I gotta get
this out of the bag I've been dying to
try this so this is this skip hop corner
bath toy organizer so all those little
bath toys it sits in the corner and it's
a little gray whale and it just holds
all the toys and then there's mesh on
the bottom so water can go through it
you know it's not all just sitting in
there easy to wash and I just thought I
love it I love that it's something that
will wrangle all those toys and she gets
a little older and it's cute I like that
it was gray that bathroom she'll be in
as gray as well I just thought it was so
cute I love it
and then on that gray note she also sits
again let me open it it's the same line
it's that brand skip hop and it's a
little waterfall bath rinser now I am
very well aware of how extra this is
trust me but it was so cute and the fact
that they had this too I was like I know
I don't need it I know that I can use a
cup to wear instant water off the baby
but she's gonna be so cute so anyway I'm
just so excited Tyler was giggling when
we open this he's like just gonna do
seriously register because I'm like yes
he's like well it is really cute I'm
like I know oh I love it
and then she really cuz obviously like I
said kind of grays and light Pink's this
little owl portable baby sue there again
skip hop is the same brand so we
registered for like one of the nice ones
for the bedroom where you can get you up
with your app and you can there can be a
certain light on as they get older like
no you're supposed to still be sleeping
you know those kinds of things and it
plays music and sounds and white noise
so that's on a registry but this was
more for like when we're on the go so
like if we're going to a grandparents
house or if we're you know in the car
and I just want something like that I
thought this is so perfect it's so cute
easily portable and just perfect so see
she also sent this pack and play play
our changing table pads so we registered
for pack and play and so it's for the
changing table portion of it near the
top it comes with two and again gray I'm
like that's so perfect and they're like
really nice and she also sent one of the
Pasi grips I'm like that's useful cuz
I'm sure we will need more than one of
so many things and then these little
Carter little three pack of mittens so
she don't squash whole face up Jessica
you got a break that happened and then
the look at these sweet little hats if
they're from Gerber and they've got
these little ears on this one and then
the other one that comes with it just
has little lambs so so sweet so those
might go just like right into her
hospital bag honestly once I wash them
so that was awesome so a subscribers
Sophie sent all kinds of little goodies
so she sent this little brush and comb
sets so cute for her little hair and
then a bottle brush from dr. Brown's I
thought this is cool cuz it can stand
upright and it's got all the different
parts you'd need and I've just heard dr.
Brown's just generally is a really good
brand and then she sent a different
pattern of the little Pasi grips and
this one's pink with white polka dots
which I adore and then some little
pacifiers little pasties so these are
for 0 to 3 months and again these have a
hole so any of these little pasty things
would be able to loop through it so we
got the green and the pink and the
purple and then she also sent this
little bonnet oh my gosh again she's
gonna be born near the summer so I
figured that'll just be perfect to have
if we take her out I don't know how much
we're gonna take her out you know
obviously she's super young it's gonna
be a ton but so cute so Nikki okay
Nikki's a fellow youtuber her name is
Nikki Murphy I will link her channel
below
she is lovely I've watched her for years
we've kind of interacted just kind of
off and on through YouTube and social
media
stuff over the years and she sent some
stuff from our registries while she sent
the tooth book from dr. Seuss which is
so cute I love it and then she says it
sent me something I'm so excited to try
this is the boba little baby wrap um you
know it from what I've heard it just
depends on what you end up liking some
people really like these kinds of wraps
some people hate them and they like the
more structured ones so I'm just really
excited I thought this will just be nice
to give a try and I love the colors
um I know I think I bought this exact
thing for my niece when she had her baby
so anyway really excited to try the boba
wrap for sure thank you so much Nicky so
Marissa sent us something that's so
intriguing to us it's the pacifier
medicine dispenser so you put the
medicine in one little end of it and
then as they suck on the pacifier
they're sucking down whatever medicine
and I thought oh my gosh that is so
genius so very excited to try that thank
you so much and then talen sent us this
little honeycomb drawer organizer so
literally you put it in drawers and
we've got tons of dresser drawers here
and it can help organize smaller things
so like I'm picturing I don't know like
little bits of socks I don't really know
I'm trying to like think of all the
different things but little bows maybe
even whatever it might be I thought oh
my gosh that's so perfect and then
tabatha sent us this another halo sleep
sack but this is the swaddle so it
velcros across and I heard some babies a
wiggle right out of these some don't so
I'm intrigued to see if - but it was so
pretty and light pink and it says back
his best again and yeah so the swaddle
just kind of felt hers across and it's a
soft little fleece and this one is
newborn size and did get newborn for
that one or I registered for newborn
so Ashley got us these little Burt's
Bees burp cloths and again they're so
soft so so cute so one's pink and white
striped and the other it's just plain
pink and I just they're so soft I'm so
excited so excited for her to spit up on
these I know that's what's gonna happen
these from Celeste and
lots of really useful things so this is
the dr. Brown's infant to toddler
toothbrush set and I thought that's
pretty cool so it's got lit looks like a
little elephant and it's just a little
training toothbrush it's really soft it
says for baby's first teeth the body is
kind of more flexible it's easy to hold
and of course the tooth bases you're
allowed to swallow there's no fluoride
or anything in it so I thought that's so
perfect it's so cute
and then she sent some smooth clip
little nail clippers that are a little
safer to use than like the ones I have
I'd probably lap her whole finger off
why would I say that that's disgusting
anyway so safer to use and then also the
thing that grosses so many people out
but I was like the reviews again don't
lie everyone in the reviews for like it
sounds gross but I'm telling you it
works it's the free to baby Nosefrida
it's not sucker but you get these little
hygiene filters so I mean obviously
you're not sucking something into your
mouth that's disgusting but I mean
there's a little hygiene layer it really
freaks Tyler out frankly it kind of
freaks me out but I'm like dude if it
works I'm in I'm totally in so I'm very
intrigued very excited thank you so much
some of these were sweetly gift-wrapped
so this is from Alison and look at these
little no scratch mittens so these
there's like a pink one and then there's
like a cream one with a little bit of
pink on it
I gotta decide which ones put in the
hospital bag oh my gosh but really
really cute and then a sweet set of
socks there's six socks in here and they
look like little mary-jane shoes you
know like with those socks and the
little buckle oh I love it thank you
Emily sent this oh and OH first 100
numbers oh my gosh
it's like little things that you can't
oh my gosh it's so cute
and the please and thank you book from
the Berenstein bears oh my gosh I loved
the Berenstein bears Oh another tooth
book it's so cute and then baby touch
and feel colors and shapes and eating
the alphabet by Lois Ehlert oh my gosh
such good books can't wait to read to
her I know a lot of you guys are asking
like do you guys reads we're like in
them and her in here in your tummy
we really have it yeah and I'm like does
it really make a difference I I haven't
looked into it it might we play music
for that's for sure in there but off to
make Tyler read to me I think he like
feels weird about it like - trust me
there's nothing to feel weird about
anymore I mean we're being on that point
so this did not have a name on here
with who for who it was from but it's
Disney baby's first words and song so it
plays music I want to play it cuz I
don't know how to turn it off yet but it
plays music and they can sing along to
it and it's so cute and then also
something I'm so intrigued by this is
from the brand poppy and it's their
shopping cart cover now some people told
me it's just it's not worth it like it's
it just takes so long to get on there
sometimes and sometimes you just don't
have the time but I thought it was so
cute and like I just want to try it I
want to know and the thing that sold me
on it was you could put it on like you
know like those little high chairs that
are at restaurants like that would be
kind of nice just from a hygiene
perspective as well so I just I was just
so intrigued I thought the pattern was
really cute the gray and like the yellow
oh my gosh also Millie from earlier also
sent this cute grey and white polka dot
pack and play waterproof fitted sheet
for the bottom pad so so cute thank you
I did just got mixed in the shuffle so
it didn't get to be with your other
stuff Natasha who I think I mentioned
earlier sent me something said some more
stuff so this oh my gosh these little
onesies like long sleeve ones with the
little foot like you know the foot is
enclosed these are three to six months
cause she's looks so big she's gonna
really get that bigger wish she could
stay small but these are so so
cute they love them and then she also
sent the very highly rated boudreaux's
Butt Paste and boy I hope it works cuz
I've heard horror stories again and I
think you're registered for more than
one kind again I think I register for
desitin as well just in case but I've
really good things about this stuff
thank you so much so cute this one did
not have a name on it but it's the the
brush and comb set again heck we'll put
one in our diaper bag in one in our room
cuz they're so cute her little hair I
just can't wait to see well she have
hair maybe she won't maybe show up a
little bit here so this one is from
Heather Moore look at this
roughly rumps it's just a diaper cover
well Jean diaper cover I can't wait to
see it filled with her little diaper but
oh my gosh
does anyone else like weirdly obsessed
with like diaper buzz it's just so cute
cuz their butt looks so big and but
really it's just all pure padding and
diaper oh it's so adorable I know I'm
weird but there's no way I'm alone in
that oh my gosh so this is from Sarah
and she sent the Infantino flip advanced
four in one convertible little holder
I've heard a lot of youtubers talk about
this one it's a little more structured
than the boba but from what I've heard
it's kind of nice to have both options
to be able to you know depending on what
you're doing and depending on how big
the baby is as well so I've heard really
great things about this one too I just
registered for the gray I loved that I
figured Tyler be able to wear this one a
little bit more easily than maybe the
wrap one so that was another big part of
it so it's 8 to 32 pounds and you can do
it back front
etc it's so so cute oh my gosh I'm so
excited to try all these and then she
also sent these onesies so I registered
for lots of different sizes of just
plain white I figure you know especially
when she's really young or we're just
around the house if it's warm so three
to six months of just the Gerber little
onesies and then this is the what size a
newborn maybe yeah and then the newborn
size so I'm sure a couple of these will
be in our hospital bag as well so cute
and then oh my gosh what is this Oh like
jumper kind of a thing she set with
Oh strawberry on the butt how adorable
is that this one is um Carter's and it's
three months oh my gosh and then these
little pasties so I've heard these these
are the ma'am pacifiers and I've heard
these are really really good like
orthodontists recommend them so they
don't mess with the development of the
kids teeth I don't know again I don't
know how true that is I'm not an
orthodontist but I thought well that's
pretty cool
so this is six months plus cuz the other
ones I've got are usually like zero to
three months or just like less than six
months so this is for if she needs them
as she gets a little bit older so this
is also from Heather who I'd mentioned
before but look at this oh my gosh so
this is eighteen months so this is when
she's a little bit older but look at
this coat so it has this like little
built-in like hoody thing and then it's
just like a black kind of quilted coat I
was like this is so freaking cute I just
I couldn't Turner hasn't seen this yet
he's gonna die when he does it's
adorable little stylin little girl this
is also from Heather oh my gosh that was
way too kind oh okay so it's this little
like fleece polka dot little shirt it's
six to nine months which will be perfect
cuz it'll be right around wintertime
then with a little shirt underneath and
then it comes with little pink leggings
I oh my gosh come on that is so cute
thank you so much so this is from
Tiffany she got us the last of the hello
world books we didn't have so this is
the New York one I think there's only
four even on the back so now we have all
of them that's so cute so this one's a
book of colors and then she also sent I
don't legally registered for this this
is so cute those are the fun items
it's like matching print from that other
bib we got but then it also has some
other ones and I think the other bid is
meant for when they're a little older
and this is a little bit more yeah six
to 24 months oh my gosh little minis on
all of these are so cute they feel like
they'd be really easy to wipe down like
really easy so this is from Natasha who
sent a bunch of stuff and it's kind of
coming in different shipments I'm
realizing but this is from the brand
Bobbi now this is not a classic boppy
is this newborn lounger and I thought it
might be I registered for a different
like breastfeeding helper kind of thing
called my breast friend because I've
just heard a lot more people say that's
just a little bit easier to breastfeed
with then a regular boppy now the nice
thing about a regular papi is it does
both purposes whereas the my breast
friend would not work for a baby like
laying on it it would really only work
for breastfeeding
but this I figure well if I get that one
for breastfeeding then this might be
ideal for them just lounging around so
it's a newborn lounger it's inclined for
perfect positioning there's no hole in
the middle it just kind of dips in just
a tinge recess to Credle bait cradle
baby and it has a handle for easy
carrying I don't know how often you're
carrying it but zero to four months so
the max is 16 pounds so we can only use
it for a matter of time but I thought oh
my gosh it just looks so perfect
and I love the pattern I love it so much
oh my gosh okay so this is from Natasha
as well okay this is way too nice you
guys are way too kind to us so this is
this baby fast that we registered for
again the reviews were so high because
the water just goes right through it you
you know it's it's like the most ideal
thing you just set them in here it's
comfortable it sits in there it's not
gonna slip around because it's got a
rubber gripping on the bottom but the
water just goes right through it so it's
not just sitting in standing water or
anything like that I thought that is
literally perfect perfect it was the it
was the most ideal one for what we
wanted and then she also said these
little
swaddle me newborn zero to three month
little pod things it's so so cute so
it's just you know their arms are in oh
I'm so excited to put her in all this
stuff so that's all I think that I'm
gonna show today like looking around
trying to make sure I didn't forget
anything
like I said I might do one more of these
because we haven't checked our peel box
I know a lot of you guys have tweeted me
and said hey you guys sent something to
your peel box did you get it I'm like
leave it checked in a while and just
other things that I know we've gotten
emails from our registry you guys are so
ridiculously kind I cannot thank you
enough we are I mean I'm just like
so please know that anything that if for
some reason we don't use it for one
reason or another we will definitely
donate it to someone that is it needs
someone that you know really needs this
stuff because there's no we're so
blessed and I want to be able to pass
that on so that's one way you know as
I've thought about I'm like oh my gosh
like this is just so overwhelming how
can we make sure that you know whatever
we're not utilizing for one reason or
another we don't need to return I would
rather pass it on to someone that's
really in need whether it's a charity or
I mean there's a lot of things I know my
sister does a lot of work with this one
charity for expectant mothers that maybe
just don't have a lot of money they're
in a really bad situation I think that
might be where I end up donating some of
the things that we don't end up using
and so thank you guys so much from the
bottom my heart I hope you guys know how
much we appreciate all of this it's so
exciting each and every day opening some
of this stuff and just feeling like you
know your heart just starts pounding
because our lives are so close to
changing but in many ways it's already
changed so thank you guys so much and I
love you all and I hope you subscribe if
you're not subscribed already and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
