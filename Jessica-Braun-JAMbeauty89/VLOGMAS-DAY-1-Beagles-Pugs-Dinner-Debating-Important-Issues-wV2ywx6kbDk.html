this thing on it's just a mirror I'm in
a crazy mood today
it's Friday and since I'm a teacher
today is colonial day I mean it's not
colonial day because I'm a teacher I was
just letting you know in case you don't
know cuz I'm sure that will come up in
some vlogs ok I get it you're low on
battery and all it really did run out
all right you're gonna have to do with
me and boring lighting um this is the
state of affairs in my room right now I
filmed yesterday pushed everything away
I mean it's just a mess
I think I'm making a video live tonight
that I edited the one I filmed what am i
talk about so it fits up it was in Ulta
haul so I'll put that below but today is
colonial day and so I got to go put my
little costume on I might put it on at
school it's kind of cold out but it's
just a fun day where the kids do all
kind of colonial games the parents
freaking rock this day and I mean we
like really don't have to do much the
parents do everything and it's unbeliev
this day is so much fun so anyway that
is what is in the works for today I know
my husband is he's been renovating our
bathroom and he works from home as well
so I think he might want to show you
guys an update on that we'll see I've
told him I'm like alright we're doing
vlogmas he's like ok cool I was like and
I'm putting him on my channel not yours
he's like alright like ok but I know he
was wanting to show cuz he that bathroom
looks so cool and there's still some
more work we're doing but we've got
guests coming this like I've got family
coming over tonight and then one of my
best friends is coming over tomorrow
night from down from Chicago which is
exciting I haven't seen her in a while
and and I don't think she's ever seen
our house either so I'm excited just you
know I just miss her so that's gonna be
fun and we finally got our Christmas
decor up so we'll show you that later as
well anyway I got to go to work
once I get dressed and I'll talk to you
guys soon this is my colonial dress from
Amazon California costume not the most
well made but it totally gets the job
done each year everyone always calls me
um not Little Miss Muffett Little Bo
Peep all the other teachers I'm like
thanks guys alright for those of you
who are subscribed to my channel Tyler
travels TV this is probably pretty
similar to what you just saw if you
watch the vlog on my channel because we
usually vlog on my channel but this now
we're doing vlogmas we're doing that on
Jessica's channel so also we're watching
these two bozos I don't know if Jessica
talked about that this morning or I
don't know but these two ding-dongs
that's our dog Pinocchio and then
there's ding dong there that's Simba
what's she doing what's she doing but
he's Jessica's parents dog we've been
watching him for Jessica pull in here
she is home from work these two boys
just heard the garage door who's here
who's here you better go check it out
you better go check it out who's here we
also decorated for Christmas Jessica and
I when she comes inside we're not anyway
Jessica's home so I'm gonna go say hi to
her but I hope you guys enjoy blog miss
and if you guys like these kind of vlogs
be sure and subscribe on my channel cuz
we do these kind of vlogs are at the
whole year on my channel but I'm gonna
say hi to Jessica high school and I
don't use it oh man I drink tea all day
I'm like after school today I was
grading it really has been a long day so
we're kind of straightening up our house
right now Tyler's doing some dishes I'm
cleaning like the upstairs we always
like divvy our chores if you will um
anyway I'm like looking at my makeup
room and I'm like I really need to clean
it but I kind of think today might be
one of those days that I just shut the
door I go vacuum out here and I deal
with this in the morning because I don't
even want to look at it it's so excited
I just put a halt
on my channel in Ulta haul so like all
that's there so I had so much fun
playing with it this morning and then I
just have other stuff everywhere and I'm
like it's an awesome mess but a terrible
mess anyway Pinocchio you just came in
to lay down you're so sleepy but my
parents are coming over and little Simba
there Simba your mommy and daddy are
coming to get you buddy my parents are
coming over we're gonna have some dinner
for them and they're gonna get this
little stinker I'm kind of gonna miss
you buddy
you've been a very good boy other than
when you pee in the house anyway so
that's kind of our plan I can hear
Tyler's listening to Bob's Burgers
downstairs or watching it you know I
mean gosh I love it show anyone else
love that show we were like weirdly
addicted to it I can't explain it
anyway so that's the plan I might vlog a
bit while they're here so they can say
hi I think a lot of you guys have met
them though my parents on liking our
Disney vlogs we took them to Disney last
summer so that was on Tyler's channel
which I can link below that was so much
fun cuz they'd never been and it was
like sharing one of our favorite things
in the world with my freaking parents
who I love more than anything in the
world so anyway I'll shut up but I'll
check back in in a bit oh oh you're just
absolutely exhausted I can't even look
at you I'm so tired no you did a great
job these two flip the switch and you
get into the mode
lifted her coffee mug class elite and
they were they had to go to Amsterdam oh
yeah and they film there you know and
they were doing their own blog that you
had asked him to do yeah and so in the
meantime and shows you guys and back to
them that was pretty cool I like that
hey police no now you have to we're
talking about our Ireland's Lobster
we're talking about the difference
between irony and coincidence and I
swear every time they come over for
dinner we talk about this and what have
we decide the best examples of irony and
coincidence hi okay so I was saying cuz
irony and coincidence are different
things and people always say well that's
ironic
we the four of us talk about this way I
came up it's a perfect thing to try and
explain it so Louis in my opinion this
is perfect so a coincidence this is a
coincidence
if a building catches on fire and a fire
truck just happens to be sitting there
in front of it that's a coincidence that
the fire Chargers happen to be there and
the buildings on fire so yeah IRA I'm
sorry irony is if a fire truck catches
on fire because the job of a fire truck
is to put out fires and it caught on
fire that's ironic because it's like
opposites and so those are different
things and people always use them I'm
selling them earlier I'm sure it's a
miracle okay so now there's irony
quintet's and miracle we were I was
telling the vlog earlier about how they
may recognize you guys from our Disney
vlogs on Tennis Channel someone we went
last year
that was last year right no they think
you're will who's Chloe noises no not
really no anything else I don't know
anything
I almost been Will Rogers like as in
Will Rogers Follies no that's depressed
some things it's openness and now
Simba's back find me some I get down oh
we haven't shown our tree yet we're both
so tired it's like 9:15 and we're like
we should have been in bed two hours ago
yeah that's way passer but the good news
is it's the weekend yes yes oh yes
fighting is getting crazy but there's
our little sleep hunger free I know I do
to you white but my nose is always where
your classic will show you one of our
trees maybe II tomorrow whatever you
want
saving it yeah we gotta do take care
your hair my god what 25 days of this
stuff we gotta do
yeah spread it up our lives are so
boring I'm like no one's gonna care I
was talking about that and I don't know
if it the one I did on here the one I
did for my channel but I'm like it's
been like a month since I've put up a
video I couldn't even tell you there's
there's rubies months worth of footage
you don't do that much we're not that
exciting yeah we really aren't
I'm so sorry every weekly vlogs monthly
maybe didn't even see me we don't do
that much that's right I'll try anyway
we'll see you guys tomorrow
