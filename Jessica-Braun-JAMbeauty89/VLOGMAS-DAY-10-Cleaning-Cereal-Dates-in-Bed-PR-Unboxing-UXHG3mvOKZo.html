right now Tyler still sleeping I wanted
to do something nice because he went and
got me that McDonald's last night and it
was so sweet and the more I thought
about I was like oh my gosh oh so sweet
so I'm trying to clean the kitchen
really fast so the kitchen is pretty
much clean it was covered I need to like
wipe down our granite and stuff but like
this that's the state of affairs PR
boxes IKEA boxes we're getting more for
Mikey I deliver today for a closet I'm
so excited I'm so excited it was like
and the thing is like with our closet
like it's a decent-sized closet but it
just has the classic racks like I've
always had my whole life like I've never
had anything beyond just like those
white wire racks and there's nothing
wrong with them but you know like
there's all this space in between them
like man like I feel like I could be
using that space and so I had like a you
know shoe thing there for a while and
then I got rid of that because it was
kind of cheap and falling apart
anyway so I'm excited because you know
we can decide exactly how we want
everything because it's IKEA like we can
put it in the holes and then like
there's hole I don't know how to explain
it but it's basically like these empty
shell shells and you can put shelves or
you know drawers or like thin drawers
for jewelry and sunglasses or shoe racks
that slide out like there's so many of
course hanging racks pants racks so it
was so fun to do we spent like hours at
IKEA doing it and I'm just so excited to
get it all together I'm excited to kind
of get rid of things more things in the
process I've probably in the past four
or five years I've probably gotten rid
of more than half of my clothes if not
honestly like 75% of them just because I
realized I don't need all of them I
don't wear all of them so why you know
have that clutter when I'm always
weeding through to find the same 25%
that I always wear so anyway I'm so
excited I'm hoping he gets set up some
time here in December he's wanting to
like knock it out like today I don't
know
we'll see but also he bought a compost
bin we have like a little thing to put
like compost in like you know banana
peels etc but this is really nice he
found online and I'm excited because
we'll hopefully have a garden next year
and the compost will be great for that
anyway so yeah that is the state of
affairs this morning also I have these
like window Klingons I want to put on
the windows today so we'll see some
quick blueberry Neil my favorite things
to put in are blueberries and brown
sugar clump I love that I love brown
sugar um sometimes we'll put in coconut
sugar but honestly brown sugar just
tastes better so that's really how I put
in I used to put butter in but I kind of
realized you don't need it cuz with
these together it kind of oh and I do
put in some salt because I like sweet
and salty together and weird I guess but
I love you every time I'm like cuz I'm
gonna make oatmeal like Chad you want
some he's like yeah okay and I'm like
are you sure I mean I'm already gonna
dirty the pan and he's like okay like
every talking anyway maybe that's a hint
that he doesn't like my oatmeal no but
he makes it the exact same way so I
don't although he usually like steel-cut
which we have but it just takes longer
and frankly I'm really hungry and these
are quicker so there mm-hmm okay so I
got my little window klingons on there
so cute I bought a bunch of different
sets and I thought I don't know if these
are gonna go together but I kind of
picked out the ones that did I'm like
yeah this works
I love window cleaning on scuzz they're
so inexpensive but they're so festive
and fun and cheesy and I just love it
okay it's the last time our closet will
look like this I'm so excited because I
feel like you know like yes I did I was
talking about this morning we have so
much like empty space which is good that
means we don't have more than what we
really need I mean well we do already
have more than what we need well it's
just kind of like random you know so I'm
so excited
we have we have the one layer which is
what I've always had my whole life but
I'm so excited to have something
different and it makes sense for most
bedrooms but I feel like for a master
closet especially for like we were
talking just have the room resale value
especially like wouldn't wait for one
turn around and sell this house in you
know five or 10 years people want a
master closet that's like a master
closet sure I'm excited I'm really
really excited this is like what we said
is our Christmas gift to each other no
we decided we're not gonna get gifts for
each other this is our Christmas gift
for the both of us to eat you know it
looks pink behind you Oh weird it does
that's weird
anyway so take a good look and we'll
show you the after it won't be in
today's vlogmas that's for sure
it'll be future but hi little buddies oh
so cute how long is this gonna take two
weeks so I'm opening some kind of PR etc
and pixie sent a giant bottle of their
glow tonic with my name on it
I was squealing isn't it funny how like
dumb things like that are so exciting
that's so exciting but it comes with a
pop no here's the deal my history with
glow tonic is I used it for a couple
days and it really made my skin feel
like it was burning so I'm like ah and
so I stopped using it well a lot of you
guys are like no Jessica like it's
really good you know it might feel like
that at first your skin is getting used
to it you know it is a glycolic acid etc
so I'm like you know what maybe I'll
give it a try so I'm going to give it a
fair shot considering so many people
love it and I am curious to try it you
know for a few weeks and see how it how
my skin reacts cuz you know anyway so I
am excited that's just cute packaging
also I got this really sweet note in my
peel box and they didn't even put their
name but they were just saying you know
I know you wanted these look they sent
me the violet Voss Holy Grail palette
that I was just talking about and then
they also sent these anasazi liquid
lipsticks coz I was mentioning how I've
never tried them I wanted to try them I
just can't believe
how sweet that is and then what was the
other thing they sent oh and one of the
nude beauty blenders I was like that is
so incredibly sweet so I'm so excited to
try these out definitely let you guys
know how I feel about him after I tried
him for a while but oh my gosh thank you
so much that was so sweet
I mean look at this palette it's so
beautiful
let's watch some oh my gosh
interesting what else let's do one of
the pinks oh my gosh I am so excited
alright so we just spent the latter half
of our day and evening at my oldest
brother's house with all of our family
because my nephew just joined the
Marines and he's back from boot camp
before he's like in Japan for two years
so we were all kind of celebrating
Christmas with him a little bit and
having dinner and it was just lovely
however he lives like an hour away from
us so it's an hour there in an hour back
so it's like so it's 9 p.m. and I'm like
it's bedtime I gotta work in the morning
um but I am trying out the glow tonic I
showed you earlier I decided to go ahead
and try it so I just put it on a cotton
pad and just um wiped it everywhere it's
not it doesn't burn or anything I feel
like I remembered it burning like upon
first use the last time I used it so
that's good
we'll see I'm gonna give it like I said
the old college try um and see if it
improves my skin it's funny because I'm
looking at myself in my own mirror and I
see no redness but like on the screen am
I ooh a lot of redness so it's it's just
weird what's wrong with my eyes um
anyway so I think we're going to have a
cereal date in bed that's all like easy
Pinocchio he put he's like who are you
talking to mom our cereal date in bed is
something we do because a long time ago
Tyler used to work nights and it was
before we were married but we would want
to see each other because I'd be like in
school during the day and then he would
work nights so we wouldn't see each
other but he would come over like at
like 11:00 p.m. when he'd get off so I
guess it wasn't nice it was more like
evenings so at like 11:00 paint p.m.
he'd get off and he'd come over to my
parents house like where I lived and
we'd eat cereal together and just like
talk about
days and then he would just drive home
and then I would go to bed and so it
kind of became a thing then a serial
date and then now we just do serial
dates in bed when we're like okay we
need dinner like way earlier more like
starving
so we'll just eat cereal in bed and it's
just like a fun date so that is what
we're gonna do and watch some TV and
then go to bed so I hope you guys
enjoyed flog missed a 10 I'll see you
guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
