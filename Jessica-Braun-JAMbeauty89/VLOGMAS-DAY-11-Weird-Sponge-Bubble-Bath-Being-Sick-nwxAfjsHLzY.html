all stop doing my hair it's all sore so
a couple of things I'm gonna be trying
I'm just gonna tell you all in one fell
swoop and then stop vlogging for the
morning cuz I thirds but this is from
it's like a velvet sponge
let me grab the box it is from Juno in
Co they sent me two of them and so it
says that it absorbs like way less
product I don't know if it's because of
this like velvety feel I haven't gotten
it wet yet so I might use that today
another thing I'm gonna try is this
drunk elephant be Hydra intensive
hydration gel they have sent me PR
packages of their stuff and they sent me
another package and I was so excited cuz
I've been trying so much and it's so
expensive but you know if I fell in love
with something I would buy it you know
what I mean it is worth it even though
it's like so expensive but to me it is
worth it it just depends I mean it's got
to be like revolutionary to me so I'm
excited to give this a try just because
I feel like in the winter just having
extra hydration so I think I would do
this and still moisturizer since this is
more gel like it and even said you can
pair it with your moisturizers so those
are kind of the two things I'm trying
out today I'll let you know how they go
III did the UM elf flawless finished
foundation with my favorites
it definitely absorbs less product I
don't think it was bad it was just weird
because it doesn't feel
I mean it's soft it got bigger when you
got it wet it applied it okay I felt
like it was a little bit more work just
cuz I wasn't used to it and it doesn't
quite bounce the way you kind of I guess
it does it was just odd I would need to
get used to this which is fine but like
I said it definitely absorbed less
product but I still feel like it took
the same amount of product to cover my
face so the end of the day it's like did
I use less product no it
so I'm curious to see how this comes
clean as well okay so this it Cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination is
the only powder I can put on when like
my nose was red but I had like some dry
skin and I'm like look if I put any more
foundation on that it's just gonna look
crazy err and so I thought okay what can
I use to get more coverage like
concealer is gonna make it look crazier
most powders will make it look crazier
and then I'm like wait so I grabbed this
powder it's a powder but it just I don't
know how to describe what it does this
is what I'm talking about and why I keep
repurchasing it even though it's freakin
expensive because it will cover my like
my dry skin on my nose and it doesn't
make it look worse it's like the
craziest thing how does it work it's
witchcraft you know when you're like
you've got that cold I feel like the
first day of it colds are worse even
though you don't feel the worst because
it's just like you know it's all
happening so you're really in your head
and like my eyes feel like literally
foggy and like I'm like anyway um I feel
like my skin turned out really nice I
did end up setting it with my favorite
cover FX setting spray it's mattifying I
don't think it completely mattifies like
I talked about how after about five or
ten minutes it does kind of get rid of a
lot of shine but not completely and
that's why I like it cuz I like to have
a little bit of glow but I feel like my
skin turned out pretty nice I used the
new Holy Grail palette that I talked
about in yesterday's vlog that a
subscriber sent that I was like holy
moly and holy moly it's a really good
ballot I was having so much fun I was
just like all the palettes blended like
a freakin dream it was awesome so anyway
I need I have so many new palettes that
I'm trying that are like hyped palettes
once I feel like I've tried all of them
for quite a while I'm gay cuz I don't
think doing a review on every single one
separately
I feel like isn't a good use of my time
or yours I feel like I should just do a
longer video one video reviewing all of
them and then telling you maybe what is
my number one or top two or three out of
all of them recommend
like if you have a gift card or you're
wanting to spend your money which do I
think you might like the best let me
know your thoughts the day is gone it is
6 p.m. I can't we had a meeting after
school I came home slept Tyler had
bought me medicine while I was at work
he it's a long story so I forgot to wear
the appropriate clothing for what we
were doing at school today we were
outside for like two hours and it was
like 40 degrees out for these like
team-building things so he was so sweet
and he brought me like a change of
clothes like warm warm warm stuff
because I was wearing you know like
boots but they were like dress boots and
a dress in leggings so he brought me a
whole change of clothes was just so
sweet
and he also got me some medicine for my
cold and so anyway while he was there he
picked something up for me and I want
you guys to see it do you recognize this
you'd seen that I talked about it but I
didn't actually buy it and so he said
well it was twenty four twenty five
percent off I figured well it's really
cute I didn't know what did this
get that puppy rump oh my gosh that's a
lot that is so few things were getting
onions oh you just disappeared love you
meaning I'm sure that this is like way
TMI but Tyler picked this up for me we
needed a new one cuz you are supposed to
replace it every every once in a while
but it's this sinus rinse thing and you
sorry you squeeze it and it goes up one
nostril and out the other and I was able
to get it this way but I'm like I've got
you know like just a sinus pressure
headache so then I tried to put it this
way and it's what's come out the other
nostril it is not coming out that other
nostril I'm like aha found the blockage
but it's so it's good at just
moisturizing your nasal passages and we
use it just throughout the winter like
I'd been using it for weeks anyway just
because you know once you have the heat
on your house it's so dry and for me
like I really do get those pressure
headaches just from the dry air in my
nose and you can get nosebleeds I mean
there's so much so I have become like a
freakin pro at all this kind of stuff to
moisture your nasal passage I'm such a
nerd I know some of your zipper like
what are you talk about it is
life-changing and it's also really good
if you have allergies like I have really
bad like hay fever you know spring
allergies and this helps me a lot then
too if I do it morning and night it just
helps kind of clear the allergens out of
there I'm not sure if that's truly what
it does but it just moisturizes it again
cuz you're sneezing all the time and
anyway I freaking love this stuff this
is my favorite version I mean you just
find out like CVS Walgreens wherever
they have like yeah they have like a
bunch of other stuff I've tried that but
I like this better it's just really like
you squeeze it and it really forces it
up there really like was this too much
information I'm sorry if it girls to
guys out isn't this just like classic
cold okay I'll shut up about it I know I
feel like I'm being a baby I even told
Tyler I'm like alright I'm sorry I'm
being baby
because I was big fun of him for being a
baby when he's sick like my Tyler I know
you have a cold you poor poor baby but
you're acting like a baby
but now I'm the baby not tonight is
someone healthy some whatnot we've got
some whole-grain like rice it's like a
blend Tyler what did you say was
actually in it quinoa bulgur wheat brown
rice it looks like yeah yeah so it's got
it's packed with a lot which it's
actually really really good and green
beans actually these are leftovers um
another night and then just chicken
chicken patties so healthy no no he just
got a balance that Fe so he's got his
project going on we're about to watch
the new episode of Bob's Burgers I've
been looking forward to this oh and
there's one of our new Cheers
it's not gonna go in front of the tree
we've just got it there for right now
but um I love it from Ikea how much was
this like once 69 I might be able to
find it in Lincoln if you're curious but
we put one in our bedroom it looks
awesome and then we think it's so
weirdly comfy like the most comfortable
piece of furniture we own Nanami I like
your grand shirt thank you
dr. teals like salt I have this relax
and relief and then I also have the
soften and nourish with milk and honey
but I'm turning my body just for
nice war so I love this but I genuinely
relaxing my muscles and then I like
pairing it with this for some bubbles
their village Naturals aches and pains
nights when I leave I don't know if you
can hear me over the bathtub as it's
loud or quiet some of my others that
like this is um new it's from Star
organics which I've gotten their bath
bombs before like they've sent them in
PR and they're really really good but
now they have like a bath bomb
subscription and so they just sent me
one pretty reason and I got so fun so if
I can find a link for it I'll make it
below it
I don't even to do a bath on tonight
hold it's Christmassy it makes me want
to do one and then of course I've got
one of my favorites the uLTA Beauty
buttercream cupcake ones I've got some
in there too and I like to do a sheet
mask so I just took my makeup off and oh
my gosh this is my treasure trove like I
get so excited opening this drawer I
mean like oh my god what one do I want
to do um but this is one of my favorite
this the last bath I got hydrology is my
favorite brand of all time wouldn't cut
my hands are wet for wash my hands gross
washing my face in you um
pathology they make the best masse I I
just love it everyone they've ever come
up with I even have the patch ology i
jealous I love those too
anyway um this is a detox where it's
like a charcoal mask or a mud mask I
mean but it's like less messy because
it's part of a sheet mask it's genius
anyway um but I think I'm gonna do more
of like a hydrating kind of calming one
I don't know oh I have these Christmas
puns too from I think last year's gift
guide I got a bunch and these are all I
have left
there are Tony moly they're so cute um
they usually stay on the back like this
is a nourishing sheet mask moisture to
dry skin moisture and elasticity and
maybe I'll be one of those okay so this
is the one I chose it says higher on
melting shower to mask the seven free
formula enrich enrich melting child
cream facial mask provides moisture and
assisity
to more delicate skin so assuming this
has hyaluronic acid in it my skin really
likes that so there's the ingredients
niacin amide I'm really just looking for
products that I actually know you know
it's there's so many products anyway I'm
excited to try that mask felt very
moisturizing it feels so nice I like
when I finally peeled the mask off I was
still in the bathtub and I didn't even
like Pat it in I just like let it sit on
my skin for the rest of it it's so
moisturizing it's so awesome so I'm
gonna put it actual moisturizer on and
brush my teeth and stuff and go to bed
so I hope you enjoyed day 11 and I'll
see you guys in tomorrow's bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
