out the violet lost Holy Grail palette I
love this stuff of course I haven't put
on light or anything but um let me flip
the camera around I'll show you what
shades I'm using but I just I were
yesterday and I had like even mice well
I had one student I should say um say
something she was just like staring at
my eyeshadow I was talking to her I was
like but it well I guess that could have
been a bad thing I don't know anyway I
feel like the look yesterday was really
really nice let me flip the camera
around so I used things a lot say just
to kind of start me off and then I used
bestie in my crease everywhere and and
then I have cool beans on my lid brow
any points in the outer corner and then
I used a mix of crystal and thanks to
latte on my brow bone and then brownie
points on my lower lash line it's so
pretty these shadows blend so easily
like it's really obvious how well they
blend if that makes sense
oh my gosh I can't believe I'm taking
this long to try it this is one of those
products I just pulled back out I loved
for months and then I was trying other
bronzers so it was out of my everyday
makeup drawer but it's the Physicians
Formula bronze booster they have like a
shimmer version and a matte version and
I like literally just now mix these two
to bronze my face and then I use this to
set my under eye and it's just such a
good product like so so good that's like
a true contour color if that's what
you're looking for it's just gorgeous
they have the shimmer version I haven't
tried I'm kind of interested to try but
I know that I'd probably only use like
the shimmer highlight and I wouldn't
even use the shimmer bronzer so I
probably won't buy it but packaging is
cute and it's just really good yeah it's
the matte sculpting don't you hate when
the stickers are like put on wrong I
hate time but I have already added some
new things to my everyday makeup work
it's an absolute mess but like some of
those things I showed in there my recent
vlog missed some new concealers I'm
trying / like the NARS when I've already
tried but I
just this is newer the drunk elephant be
Hydra hydration gel holy moly I'm really
liking it they said it in PR so I really
want to try it for a while cuz you know
I want to know for sure is that worth
the money because their price tags are
very high one of my favorites right now
I actually just posted a sponsored post
on Instagram about these this at another
product from their line that I have been
using for like a month and a half and
I've obsessed with I think I'd snapped
about it a while ago it's like a foaming
cooling mousse primer I it's the crazies
but it's crazy
hydrating like usually I feel like a
mousse once I like rub it out on my skin
it it like just dissipates no this stuff
is like a lotion once you actually I
can't describe it you have to try it
it's the weirdest coolest thing and my
skin's just been eating this stuff up so
I'm trying a lot of primers the fenty
primer Laura Mercier more the stellar
anywho so what else is new that I put oh
I did try this I think I vlogged about
yesterday I don't think I like that I
need to clean it I don't think I like it
I really have not gotten a lot of use
out of this I've used the two matte
shades but like these glitters are just
so glittery I don't know I've been using
this like crazy but this has been a Holy
Grail for a long time this I keep
forgetting to use that Tarte poreless
clean slate timeless primer I need to
remember to use that I don't know why I
keep forgetting to maybe I'll put it
over under primers there we go
[Laughter]
so much so what I'm Chris day said you
look like Tom Hanks I could see that I
don't know what Tom makes personality is
because you know every character well
now now that we started filming proof
very exciting stuff okay so we just came
back we're trying some random stuff from
like a did you blow my Francis a little
bit of you guys moving the - it was a
very entertaining tiny stuff so we're
