know I'm talking about the Lumiere all
the time I'm really like putting this
freakin thing
through the ringer deciding is it
freakin worth the money so I know I've
talked about a lot but that's it's like
a huge focus for me this month I had
some trouble applying this today and I
can't decide I did my moisturizers all
like I usually do but I used one of my
favorite primers it's this origins
original skin it's like a foaming prayer
it's the coolest thing I'll talk about
it more in a video coming up because it
deserves to be talked about more but
right now putting this on top of that
did not work and I've used this under
like my ELF flawless finish it looks
amazing I've used it under a lot of
stuff but for some reason and maybe that
was I just realized what it might be I
forgot on my nose I put the Tarte clean
slate timeless primer just on my nose in
here and that was where it was like the
hardest to like blend in so I used a
Beauty Blender at first and then I was
grabbing my like really nice our teeth
brush and it was just going back and
forth it was weird so it was like it
wouldn't sink into this primer that
makes sense then come on light I need
you this morning anyway so it's just
kind of interesting also what I'm using
is concealer this is a product I knew I
didn't like that I'm like wow I'm gonna
try it a few more times and really
decide do I not like it this is the
Becca under-eye brightening corrector
it's super Amole you can almost see how
like creamy and almost oily it is and so
I'll put it you know in my under eye to
cover dark circles it says it's supposed
to brighten and correct I I knew it
didn't work well with a sponge so I used
this Pro airbrush concealer from Sephora
just to kind of blend it in as lightly
as I could and it just kind of blends
away I've tried it with my fingers I
tried to finish it off with the blender
like I mean it's okay but do you see
what I mean by it's like super oily so
maybe if you have really dry under eyes
you might like it because it really I've
never tried a concealer that's as like
creamy as this is come on so just kind
of interesting again I'm still messing
with it this is one of those products I
need to do a video on these products
that I feel like I'm dying to love like
I'm wanting so hard and I'm trying so
hard to love but after months of trying
it I still don't love it because I know
there's quite a few and I know a lot of
you guys probably feel the same way my
bow looks those that you know like when
you've spent money on it you know this
was not cheap I want to say it was like
25 30 bucks so when I spend my own money
on that and I hear people say oh Becca
makes amazing products and this is a
pretty good product I'm thinking well
what's wrong with me so I keep trying it
and trying it and trying it so if you'd
be interested in a video like that that
sounds like fun to talk about and it
kind of makes me sad so I'm like no way
one like this but I don't so let me know
if you'd be interested let me know if
there any products you have that are
like that I'd be curious to know so I
literally just took a cleansing wipe and
wiped it off my nose I looked like a
scarecrow it was funny
just and I reapplied so I reapplied the
lemare with no primer on my nose because
that primer I love the idea that it
fills pores but like I don't know I feel
like every few times I've tried it again
I'm still trying it out I know I sound
so negative this morning I am still
trying it out but it doesn't work on my
nose the few times I've tried it I'm
starting to notice the trend so I could
see maybe it working like here I tried
it there and I had to wipe that off too
because it looked gross cuz that's an
area that I always have like weird you
know but with no primer it looks so nice
like I feel like my nose looks healthier
it doesn't accentuate so I just feel
like it accentuates my dry skin and I
just have a weird texture my nose anyone
else and of course I have that cold
today so it doesn't help that I'm having
to blow my anyway so just my two cents
I'm gonna keep trying it I know so many
people love that and I again want to
love it
we'll see I'm trying a new well I hauled
it in my ELF video but that today's
stay I'm trying it the ultra-precise
brow pencil from ELF it worked really
well it blended really well I don't know
why I'm not surprised but um what shade
did I get you know it doesn't say
Jessica I'm it was like I feel like it
was like neutral brown or something like
that so I don't feel like it pulls to
read but it just like even though it's a
smaller pencil I usually use like the
bigger like triangular shaped ones
because I can go just go chew and my
brows are done this did not take me much
longer and I feel like it's a good color
match it blended so easily we'll see how
like well it stays on there today I
don't usually have too much trouble with
my brows like staying on you know the
color but still you never know so that
could be a really good find
I don't think yeah no I think that's
just about as thin as like the Anastasia
brow Wiz nowadays there's so many dupes
for the brow is that it's like you don't
even need to buy the brow is it you know
you really don't which is exciting and
this just might be one of them and it
was oh I'm sure well I'm not sure about
it's a definitely under $10 but probably
around 5 bucks we'll see did my almost
done I look today with the Too Faced
peachy or just peachy mattes
this product this um palette is really
good and I literally keep forgetting
about it and I don't really know why so
let me show you what shades it'll look
better with liner and mascara I promise
oh I used peach meringue just or no
peach butter all over just to get my
look started peaches and cream in the
crease and then just ripe in the outer
corner and on my lower lash line and
then I put peach meringue all over the
lid and under my brow bone and then I
again blended it all together with
peaches and cream and then I actually
pulled a shimmer from my violet Voss
palette if I can get that focused I used
Plouffe for my lid that's the only
shimmer I used so it really is a good
palette it blends pretty well I don't
think it blends as well as other
palettes I own like I actually think the
violet voix violet boss blends way
better than this does but it does blend
pretty well
but like the deeper shades
take a little bit more work to blend
whereas in this like it was like a dream
okay this was genius Lisa Stevens one of
my favorite youtubers i watch like all
of her videos I think I mention her if I
haven't mentioned her yet in a video
like for inspiring me I know for sure in
one that I've already filmed coming up
like this week that I do mention her and
her channel I love her um but that aside
she did this video called what's on my
watch later playlist genius I recently
told you guys here let me flip my camera
around I'll link her channel by the way
below I love her I'll link this video
below
anyway she what am I saying
I had like literally already lost track
time oh I had recently mentioned in a
video that about the watch later
playlist cuz a lot of you guys just
didn't know about it and I feel like I
didn't really know what it was or how to
use it until like maybe a year and a
half ago
anytime you hover over a videos
thumbnail there's a little gray like
clock that will appear when you hover
over it if you click it that
automatically adds the video to your
watch later playlist so that means that
when you go to your watch later playlist
you click on you see all the videos
you've done that for so the one thing I
wish that the watch later did is that
once you've watched all the way through
it automatically deleted from it because
there are a lot of times that I'll just
have it playing through and then I have
to go back and say okay I've watched all
6 of these videos while I was doing
laundry let's say so I delete it's not
that big of a deal I'm just being a diva
but anyway I haven't said diva and way
too long that's funny anyway I'm just
being a diva about it but I love using
that tool I sound like I'm a YouTube
marketer I'm not I mean I love you too
obviously but I'm not but I think that's
so fun that'd be a great way for me to
share maybe in a more creative way the
youtubers I love to watch cuz like as
I'm watching this that's what I'm
thinking like okay these are the
youtubers like that she likes to watch
anyway let me know if you'd be
interested I know that would be weird it
probably wouldn't be highly highly
viewed on my channel but I just think
it'd be fun and I just Lisa's coming up
with like ideas like she's freaking
turning a man I love it
ok we've taken a turn for the worse
today was the roughest day I hate Li I
do but here I am complaining today was
horrible at school like it was one of
those things that like literally I would
find myself just like sitting there like
I'd be at our group table and I'd be
between small groups and I'd just be
sitting there like oh my gosh I've got
somewhat of a fever just like body aches
and I mean you already knew about the
nasal congestion but I I think I've
actually got like an actual flu so
Tyler's so sweet and he's going grocery
shopping right now for us just because
we need groceries I was a little sad
because he's like you don't want to go
with me I'm like I can't dude I feel
crazy like I'm in bed
I don't know I took some more medicine
it was just time like to take my next
dose and I'm sure that'll help but like
it's just the headache too
anyway also complaining so I don't know
how exciting tonight's vlog will be
Tyler said he's like well you know by
the time I get home he's wanting to put
the closet together we've got like all
of our closet stuff over here um looks
so tall is our closet that's all anyway
so he wants to work on that tonight so
he's like to let me just pick something
up for dinner of like okay I feel bad
because I feel like we haven't been
super healthy this week I mean I feel
like I eat healthy breakfast and lunches
it's just always when dinner comes
around it's so hit or miss like half the
time or decently healthy half the time
or not but this is just one of those
days I don't know why I'm explaining
myself so much so I'm gonna try to take
a little bit of a nap it's like four or
something but I've already put in for a
sub for work tomorrow I was like I don't
want to get these kids sick from
whatever I've got and I just feel like I
was not my best cell today I just feel
like garbage like actual garbage anywho
so I'll check back in in a little bit so
Tyler went to Whole Foods
and there's a Whole Foods nearest but we
like this is the first time we've gone
here anyway so we got some more of our
favorite dressings let me see if I can
light this up
like well these are dude really scissors
forgot our bags we always bring bags and
I forgot them in the garage wall save
them cuz we could use it for like ashes
from the fire wooden sir
anyway that's always what I say we keep
you strong bags for what is wrong with
me
anyway um so he got creamy Caesar which
is my favorite of the Bolthouse farms
these are those yogurt dressing as I
talked about in the past along with it's
like way less fat and calories like a
lot a lot less you can see sorry I'm
trying to like do too many things at
once um so yeah 61% for your calories 81
percent less fat absolutely delicious
like it doesn't taste weird at all I'm
telling you these are new to us though
so may go Chipotle and then this one's
not a yogurt dressing it's a vinaigrette
made with olive oil it says the
raspberry Merlot and then just some
yogurt whipped cream I usually make my
own salad dressing but those are good
like if we don't have any and I don't
really want to make any like that's just
did I mean like yeah 66 percent fewer
calories it's ridiculous that's awesome
anyway so that Tyler you got some eggs
we haven't had brown eggs in so long and
they really do make a difference
meir yeah yeah it's ridiculous
yeah they used to be such a good still
for 12 eggs yeah so 89 cents for a dozen
or $8 yeah it's like that's not gonna
work these I'm so excited to have some
eggs some rotten eggs again because they
do taste bacon and so I love my King
Arthur you're a flower snob and I think
it's awesome I think it's hilarious as a
Tyler's favorite tea this breakfast to
be very like Twinings English breakfast
so I don't know why that's Asami I think
they're the same prizes like yeah and
then stress relief we haven't had this
in a while I know this has a lot of
warnings on it though it's
interesting because the ingredients it's
like you know don't know what under 80 K
drinking don't mix it with alcohol don't
like cheese like it's a very yeah it
does I do feel like it is relaxing
though that he also got me some pumpkin
seeds Pippy tests be favorito don't make
fun of us bears nobody drove a part of
it anyway so good little oh you got some
asparagus - oh and I got a sweet teacher
ornament from one of my students the
other day no sweet umm so yeah very
exciting stuff here at our household oh
yeah it keeps you Oh cute I love how
glittery we're gonna hang that on our
tree ah okay so this is what we do from
time to time we'll go to my skin care
drawers over there it's become my closet
because we're we doing that cause it
anyway um so we'll go to my skin care
drawers Natalia's like okay Jess I'm out
of moisturizer I'm like okay and what
else did he say
Anne about us here no no go back go back
go back cuz like two years ago Jessica's
like you really need a moisture in your
face is wrong naps if you get snaps
that's class that's what I say to
my kids oh my gosh it's carrying over
snap a few a group so they're so cute
anyway uh okay so we started yeah and so
then I started moisturizing it was
alright cool
then when I ran out of moisturizer I was
like hey I need another moisturizer do
you have any she's like yeah she's like
also you should do a serum wait okay so
then I started putting like a serum on
and then let it dry and then I do the
moisturizer right well then like I run
out of those two things and then she's
like you should also do a toner so okay
put the toner on then I got serum on and
then do the moistures yeah that's not
that deep and then now it's good hey the
point now alright this is no joke I got
takes me 45 minutes man oh man me too
we're doing side each other
at owner in essence the next yeah serum
and eye serum
now the new step she added tonight and
that's unlike this is can I moisturize
ER and then moisturizer yeah new stock
so what will you be using this Munster
well this I've been using for a while
yeah he's been using the electronic I
pass it on to him and then I showed you
guys recently I'm gonna try it again and
then this is another one I've been using
because I got I got everything out cuz
I'm like this is getting ridiculous I
had to haul everything out so this is
the essence thing and I don't know what
is in essence - well it's good for your
skin it's protective a lot of stuff but
this essence is weird because it's like
a lotion yesen so I'm still trying to
figure that out cuz this is skin care
still new to me - I'm trying to figure a
lot of this huh and then I got serum
what serum oh it's the same brand it's a
sort of valley brand they recently sent
me a bunch of stuff and he's kind of
trying you turned out a lot of it yeah
that's the serum right young age serum
am I too old for it no and then I got
the eye serum that's what she added
today what will you be using elephant
I'm also using this they sent me this in
PR two different times so I'm using one
and now he's seizing one how cute
although this packaging he's got is
different than my packaging and then
this is the eye stuff is totally mm-hmm
the premier cru or something yeah at
least I think that's an eye cream now
that I'm thinking about maybe it's like
a full-on butcher's it's a small size
but I think was this a nut creme riche
well whatever it's a rich cream it'll be
good for your eyes I know why did I say
probably I thought it because this size
maybe it's like a travel size why I
don't know and then I got the actual
moisturizer which is also that word
about this is where it all started I
just wanted a moisture
haha making you take carries more layers
I feel like the most most women and
probably 99% of them no but you know
what right
I never feel bad or feel silly about
because John Stamos and Rob Lowe who are
both like what in their 50s now and
least I've heard both of them talk about
on different talk shows I think they
both even have their own line now of
like moisturizer and stuff and they're
like yeah I've done moisture exercises
like in my 20s I'm like
and so I'm like John Stamos and Rob Lowe
do it in their 60 and they look better
than I do
oh we're gonna have to buy I think
waspey will wallet because it's
definitely Pinocchio's toy yeah he's
like yeah what do you why are you guys
putting that quote sit well he is my toy
if it was addressed to me
