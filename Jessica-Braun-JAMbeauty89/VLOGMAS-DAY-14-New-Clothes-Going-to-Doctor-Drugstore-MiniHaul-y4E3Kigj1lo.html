us breakfast since I stayed home sick
today and I was just like I felt like I
had like a really nice meal lots of
fruit and like vitamin C and stuff he's
so sweet oh we got a lot of sleep last
night which is really good I think my
body needed it so I wanted to unbox my
thredUP package that just got to my
doorstep this morning this videos this
vlog missed today's what this vlogmas is
actually sponsored by thredUP I've done
so many videos with them I love this
company
they sell gently-used or like new
clothing and I'm so excited to show you
guys what I picked out this time around
they did give me a 40% off coupon code
it is Jam Beauty I will have the link
and info for that down below if you're
interested but I find so many
ridiculously nice expensive
I've already torn into this guy's I was
actually pretty good that I tore into it
I was like okay just stop save your
excitement for the camera but I get so
many like expensive name-brand designer
clothing from this site I would say like
anything I own that's like I feel weird
like that you can't see my face anything
I own that's like expensive is most
likely from thredUP anyway so dig into
it I'll try to try some of these on as
well so you can see some of them on so
this is from made well and I just wanted
some more like cozy kind of v-neck
shirts this is actually nice and thick
so that's cute the Christmassy tag so
this is a size small and it feels really
well made it looks pretty brand-new that
is a trend I feel like most of the
things I get from here if not all of
them literally look brand new it's crazy
so very excited about that I also wanted
some more cardigans and I just love this
shade of blue and this is one of my
favorite brands loft and it's just a
nice like wouldn't even call this color
blue it's not quite Navy because it's
just a little bit like I don't know but
again this looks completely brand new
absolutely stunning and I just love
cardigans this time of year they're so
easy especially like if you you know
like I'm a teacher I get cold when I'm
inside even when the heat is hung so a
cardigan is kind of the
perfect like wait for a sweater the next
thing I got what I forgot some of these
Oh another one from lost this I figure
would be really cute with leggings
because it is a longer you know almost
tunic like but it is a hi-low where it's
higher in the front and lower in the
back but it's long-sleeve I just thought
the pattern was so pretty I figure you
know you could wear it with leggings
with some like camel colored boots and
the outfit is done I fit such a simple
pretty look
speaking of like sweaters at school this
is from candies which are looks like sea
candies at like holes but I loved this
color and it's just kind of one of those
open kind of free cardigans I don't know
what to call it but they're just so cozy
and I figure this color will literally
go with everything and there's like
little metallic threading throughout
which is so so cute and then Oh which
one next episode oh this one's brand new
attacks this is from maurices I don't
think I've ever owned anything from
maurices but this literally has a tag
still on it and again just another cozy
really cute striped shirt I could tuck
it into jeans with the felt and it look
cute I could wear it on its own with
like a blazer over it just a really
simple look and again for can brand new
and if you haven't noticed I've been
putting the original price and the price
that it was on thread up on the screen
as I show these so if you're curious
about you know what kinds of discounts
you get and of course the 40% off it's a
good motor okay next thing oh my gosh
this pattern I fell in love with so I
just love this these shades of like
violet and blue and this was just a maxi
dress it's really really thin but it was
forever 21
literally brand new with tags and I just
thought it was so pretty it's a size
small but it looks like it might be a
little loose but like in a cozy way I'm
not sure I mean this these are one of
those things you don't know do you try
it on um but it just looks so cozy and
cute and I said I could wear it in the
summer but I can also wear it with like
a cute sweater even in like the winter
you know what I mean I don't know I try
to pull out back these dresses all your
room oh my gosh this next one you guys
are gonna die it's a Disney one
it's from the Disney Store again that's
right it was brand new with tags it says
a resident of Neverland and it's just
like this kind of small looser t-shirt I
just thought it was so freakin cute
I was like it could be PJs it could be
Lauren for real like I would totally
wear this to Disney since its longer
again I just wear it with leggings and
tennis shoes and call it a day and I
just think that is so much fun that's so
cute
okay next thing this is another clearly
I like the brand law so searching
because you can search by brand as well
I loved this tank I love that it ties
there and I love the color it's got
little bows all over it but again I
figured with a navy blue blazer which I
already have one this would look amazing
for work for any time but especially for
work another kind of oh that's right
this is from LC which is Lauren Conrad's
line again really expensive at Target in
my opinion but I got quite a deal this
is so pretty I thought the color was
gorgeous kind of like a beige II light
pink just simple and it's just one of
those things that you just throw on
throw some like dress slacks on and
you're ready for work maybe a cute pair
of earrings so I keep talking about
Blazers I did get one this was so cute
it's from the brand copy or cabbie and I
loved it it was striped but that I had
these gold buttons I just thought it was
so cute kind of nautical almost and it
has the buttons like smaller versions of
them on the sleeve so I fell in love
with that this looks like really like
it's really really well made oh another
cozy this is from j.crew just a cozy I
can't own too many of these I literally
wear these every single day whether I'm
going to bed or if I'm like cleaning
around the house just like really comfy
cotton v-neck so and j.crew can be very
expensive so that was a nice fine and
then
gosh I did get a lot this time this is
from Lauren Conrad I thought it was so
fun it's just a straight-up sequined
cardigan
wait is it open yeah it snaps open and I
figure you know what my first glance I
thought that's kind of cheesy like is
that like Golden Girls but I was like
you know what I don't care I love it I'm
gonna try to rock it we'll see it might
look like Golden Girls I think it's kind
of cute I think you have to really pair
it with like the right everything else
like everything else has to be just
right otherwise it might look okay in
the last thing very springy is this -
did you say golden girl yeah look at
this he loves the gold girls is this -
Golden Girls II it's kind of perfect if
you know the Golden Girls you will love
that do Tyler loves Golden Girls
okay they're going to say that so the
last thing I got is from what is this
brand I thought this was so sweet kena
and it has its tags still on it and it's
just like a cute little like babydoll
top is that what you call it and I just
thought it looks so cozy but cute again
you could wear it in the spring and
summer but you could totally wear it
other times a year with a cardigan or a
blazer that is kind of my favorite way
too so that was everything definitely
check out my 40% off code down below if
you're interested and the link will be
at the beginning of my description box
but I love this is awesome okay so it's
gotten to the breaking point where I
feel so crummy we're like okay I think I
have a sinus infection
so Tyler's being sweet you feel like see
it in my like it's like this like this
Vistage of my that's not the right word
anyways I still don't think I'm using it
right anyway so he's gonna take me here
it's just like I've had many many sinus
infections and it this is exactly what
it feels like so long story short we're
going to a media carried so sweet I
don't know long cuz then I gotta go to
like CVS and wait on the prescription
and you know I don't know I mean I'll be
looking at the makeup but so I'm really
glad hopefully we'll figure out what's
going on and
get my butt feeling better cuz this just
stinks things were taking me I know I'm
being a big fat baby I know I've already
blogged about it in the previous people
the urgent care was like way too sweet
one of them is like only important thing
you look sick like thanks like I feel
like they were all my mom I do have a
sinus infection I'm not crazy
so we're gonna go get the meds I need
for that you go to CVS and I'm gonna get
I already do like a nasal rinse which is
helpful
I'm just prone to them I think but I'm
gonna get some just saline nasal spray
as well just that kind of saltwater
spray just to moisturize because doing
this the nasal rinse is the whole thing
so I usually do it morning and night but
throughout the day I think it'll be nice
just to be able to kind of moisturize my
nasal passages even while at work so
that is the plan very exciting stuff but
we did decide to cancel our trip to
Chicago this weekend just because I'm
not feeling well and I really need rest
and I we talked to my dad about it and
he was like you know what there's a lot
stacking up against this trip and the
holidays around the corner let's just
postpone it so we're probably gonna go
in January
I'm tithers out there pumping my gas
he's being sweet and my tire needs air
I'm just a big ol mess I guess it's good
that I can laugh about it but I'm
excited to get home and take a nap
because I'm just drained
can you tell you're at my desk editing
some footage and stuff and I wanted to
show you these are my favorite books to
read we're going to Disney I told you
we're canceling our Chicago trip which
is fine because then I'll get to feeling
better but we are going to Disney at the
end of December kind of over New Year's
and stuff and I love grabbing Tyler has
a huge shelf full of like Disney stuff
and I love this is a book I've read and
flagged like my favorite parts of its
Walt Disney World hidden history and
it's basically like little like it says
remnants of former's former attractions
so like things you can still see in
Disney world that are like they were a
part
something that used to be there I am a
freak about this stuff and this wasn't
this is my favorite Disney book this is
one I've not read yet the Walt Disney
World that never was I know Tyler's read
like all of these probably more than
once this I've read but it's the new
version but another absolute favorite if
you've never been to Disney or you have
but you just want to delve deeper this
is probably the best one for that
because it's all this stuff you can see
now and just all basically the stories
behind it just fascinating things things
you can notice that you maybe wouldn't
have noticed before it's so much that
like I've read this book probably twice
and I still never remember all of it but
it's so interesting to read so I love
flipping through this at night the weeks
before a Disney trip just to remind me
of a bunch of it and then another
favorite of mine that I've only read
about half of is secret stories of Walt
Disney World I'm sure this was so boring
to people that don't care about Disney
but I figured it was worth so if I can
find links to these I'll link these four
books below but also I went to the CVS
to get the medicine I needed and I
picked up two things cuz I had to kill
time while they were getting it so this
is the NYX and mega shine lip gloss in
what is it in Oh sweetheart and I figure
it looks so like pretty and shiny also
watch it here in just a sec and then I
also picked up because emily noel spoke
so highly of it the Neutrogena hydro
boost hydrating concealer she was saying
it's crazy creamy
I like that hyaluronic acid my skin
freakin loves that stuff so I'm kind of
intrigued I don't typically go for stick
concealers but I don't know the fact
that she recommended it so highly makes
me think maybe I'm missing out on
something so again let me swatch these
go fast off camera and I'll show you
okay Wow so the gloss looks gorgeous and
I already know that I love this formula
my favorite shade is beige which is
actually like a pink but this is so
pretty and then that concealer was so
creamy it collided on it I feel like
it's not doing it justice like and how
creamy it is but it just glided right on
I literally whoa that is creamy as I did
it it has this little like core in the
middle that I guess is like the
moisturizing component so it just kind
of like glides that's crazy I
so excited I know this lighting is like
not flattering at all but this is that
lip gloss on I think I like it it
definitely has that same smell that all
of the NYX mega shine lip gloss is very
like fake cherry I don't really mind but
I know some people do like I think it's
my mom that just like hates anything
cherry she's at Oh get her wet like and
not that she likes cherries it's the
smell of that you know fake cherry scent
um so she would not like it but I think
I like it I yeah I don't know I need to
try it out maybe in different lighting
I literally have my like lights on
because it's just gotten so dark in here
but and then this concealer I'm excited
I have a bill break out there that I
covered was something else but I'm
curious as how as to how this would work
because I think it actually would be a
good tone for my skin okay so it is
getting pretty late so I think we are
gonna call it a night
I'm wearing one of my new thread up
shirts I love it it's so cozy it's so
cute
but I hope you enjoyed again thanks to
throwing up for sponsoring today's
vlogmas and of course if you're
interested in it definitely check out my
