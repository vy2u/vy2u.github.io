never in a tank top
so I'm trying out well this is like the
fourth time I've tried it it's like
killing me the Laura Mercier foundation
primer hydrating this stuff is so good
so it's like the fourth maybe fifth time
I've put it on of course my face still
getting over my sinus infection but I'm
feeling a lot better the medicines
working I know I sound congested but I
feel so much better and I slept for like
12 hours last night it was awesome
anyway so this is the NYX hydro touch
primer these are very similar very very
similar and of course the next one is
much much much much cheaper but I will
say there's something more private about
the Laura Mercier one whereas the NYX
one I do like I've sung its praises it's
one that I still reach for all the time
I love this primer but it feels more
moisturizer E whereas this one feels
more primary I know that sounds
ridiculous
they're both ridiculously hydrating but
I feel like the Laura Mercier one
actually holds on to the foundation
longer whereas the next one I think does
I've never really noticed a wear time
problem but I don't feel like it it's as
easy to apply foundation on top of as
this is that make sense but I'm talking
like minuscule differences like I don't
think most people wouldn't notice it
sounds me like most people don't know as
much as I do that's not what I mean but
just that because I'm like in this
makeup world I'm you know I've noticed
these tiny little differences anyway but
I'm really enjoying this so again you
it's the hydrating one they have their
regular foundation primer I think they
have like a couple different kinds but
the hydrating one specifically oh I love
it
I'll link these below if you're curious
about either one of them whoa I feel ok
so I just used the NARS radiant creamy
concealer which you guys know I'm kind
of wishy-washy about really about why
people make such a stink about it like
how people love it I don't think it's
like the worst concealer I think it's
fine that's why I repurchased it because
again I was like I want to be able to
compare things to it because so many
people
love it and you know that's just part of
my job so I have the shade vanilla I
like it I mean I have it on my under eye
now but I did cover it with this mousse
Navy or Mustafa it's hard to see there
we go
silky cotton loose powder I'll link
these below so I heard you say that okay
get Jessica we get it
this is silky stuff it really I mean
it's a very finely milled loose powder
like most are but I used my Beauty
Blender just to dip and put it on my
under-eye and you know I kind of baked
with it I just put it there let it sit
for about a minute because that's all
the patience I have and then I wiped it
away very brightening very brightening
and I don't feel like you know I have my
fine lines I've always had them and it's
kind of funny cuz my mom has such good
skin I'm like I feel like my skin's okay
but I feel like I'm aging quicker I'm
like what I'm just gonna start wearing
no makeup and only skincare all day long
and I know my skin would be better but I
just love makeup so but anyway um what
am I talking about maybe I get it from
my dad okay stop just stop your dear
ailing yourself but I've used this only
a handful of times I got this in like
some subscription box called beauty
essentials I can link the website below
because I I've tried to look into how
people subscribe to it and I'm like what
like it seems very confusing um and
that's why I've never they've sent it to
me twice and I've never unboxed on my
channel because I don't really
understand how would anyone substrate I
think you'll see what I mean and maybe
it's changed since the last time I
checked a few months ago regardless it
was like a makeup artist like all of
their favorites there was all full-size
and I think it's kind of a pricey
subscription box well long story short I
really liked this the few times I've
used it it's just let me show you my
loose powder drawer here's my problem I
have this and I'm just done setting it
there that's when I just use and then I
have these which I love this Lancome one
it has a little bit of a tint to it I
really really like that for like extra
coverage and then I have all these so
I'm like I love my Laura Mercier that's
always when I reach for I really like
the cover FX this I just put this all
over my face this is the peach perfect
again there's like a little bit of a
tint and I like that um so that's my
problem I'm like I never reach short
because it just gets lost in the shuffle
I'm kind of thinking I want to
get over there back up a little kind of
thinking like I have this but like my
problem is I only have makeup in like
that drawer everything else is like
haircare and nail polish and wipes and
you know just random stuff that I feel
like I could probably store back in my
little drawers that I have behind that
door my closet and if I did that then
that would free that open for makeup
because I like the idea and what I done
you know as I've declared throughout my
well really the past year - oh my gosh
um is I've wanted to have all my makeup
here it makes sense why would I need
more than that well the more I think
about how this is my job and I really
need certain products to be able to
compare - especially since I like to
find more affordable things well I need
then the high-end counterpart so I can
genuinely speak to the quality of it and
compare blah blah
I'm sure I'm over explaining to myself
hey Tati I'm watching her video about
foundations anyway so long story short I
think I might start separating things
out because I feel like then when I go
to this drawer if I could genuinely see
all the loose powders I have I mean I
can see them all but I think you guys
know what I'm saying
I think I would use them more often Oh
see there's one hidden back there too
anyway so this in like my concealer are
you serious how did this happen Jessica
I was like forget obsessive concealers
hmm so I wanted to show you I talked
about the pixie lower lash mascara I
love it and I mentioned it in my oh my
recent video ten products that what did
I call it ten products
oh that are like under hype that not a
lot of people talked about but it's it
was so interesting reading your guys's
comments because some of you guys were
like oh I want to try that war you
recommended other ones because there are
a lot out there so if you're like you
can't get pixie where you live or if you
just want other options definitely read
through the comments because there are
so many amazing I'm so excited to try so
many more but a lot of you guys were
like lose some other people have tried
it they didn't like it like i really
like it i have it on my lower lashline
now it goes just and it's done i mean
sometimes I'll even use this like today
I used my favorite my L'Oreal lash
paradise on my upper lash line and
that's like one
frickin coat but sometimes says it's
getting older it gets a little clumpy
and it gets old in like a month I've
talked about that so I'll use this just
to quickly brush up through it and it'll
kind of pull out any big clumps and it's
done it's really kind of becoming a
multi-use tool my multi-use I mean I'm
using it all for lashes but you know
what I mean but so I just wanted to kind
of update you on that and show you what
it looks like in actuality I really like
that
mascara the lower lash mascara dang it I
was trying to put blush on do you see
these streaks of black that would be
because I dipped my brush on my little
towel here and I had liner on it how is
that the first time that's ever happened
that should happen to me way more often
because I am very careless so I'm gonna
get my Beauty Blender and get to work oh
yeah
this is gonna kick my cold in the behind
what do you got you got oh yeah oh yeah
almond milk
that's good powder and we usually make
enough like this usually makes enough
for at least like two days worth so
today and tomorrow makes it a little bit
more worthwhile we used to do like a
bunch of days in advance enough it does
not work as well as you would like it by
the time you like if you do it on Monday
and they were time to get to Friday it's
like I should have retied it we had it
on the other day oh no such a handsome
boy he's got his tail he's the Steel's
wagon now it won't be wagging in a
minute wait wait this is the place where
they cut me nails off oh it stick it up
you look cool super cool last time I
went to Disney classic it's so short
though that's the one thing like it's
like weirdly short so we are gonna go
take him to get his nails clip and then
Tyler is saying we see you I don't know
on the front we should go to Pet Smart
and get him something special
he gets so stressed about these
anyway here we go hey guys um so it is
like 8:40 p.m. I have like successfully
rubbed all the makeup off my nose from
like massaging my nose from all the
sinus pressure
um but I did get a couple of things in
the mail the past few days I figured you
guys might be interested to see oh my
gosh I really rubbed that makeup away I
think I'm gonna do like a really
moisturizing soothing face mask later
tonight I feel like my skin my poor poor
skin deserves it
but let me flip the camera out and show
you guys some of the things that have
come in the mail that I thought you
might be interested in
so milk makeup sent over some of their
products like the matcha toner I already
used I travel with this a lot because
it's a stick toner it doesn't take it
room in my like liquids bag but I have
been wanting to try their cooling water
kind of like a moisturizing stick let's
see what they say about it yeah a
portable save your deep Huff's eye area
instantly with soothing sea water and
caffeine it says it energizes it
hydrates so I'm excited to kind try that
I feel like my skin could use that right
now
so it sounds pretty cool they also set
one of their holographic sticks this is
like that glitter one yeah and then
what's this pink what is it like blush
oh it must be in the shade Stardust so
that's um oh I see this is the
holographic stick the pink one this
really is just the glitter stick so
don't know how much you sucking out of
that I'm interested in this I feel like
it'd almost be more of a blush for me
than anything you know but they also
sent in this bag like this I thought it
was a hair thing because of the clips
but what what do you what do you do with
it I like I kept even Tyler was trying
to figure out he's like oh here we go
interesting so now I know is cat ears
that are made of metal I'm worried that
you know like these strings and stuff
that's gonna get all caught up in my
hair and be impossible to get out that
is my greatest fear oh my gosh whoa so
super pink and holographic I guess but
look at that glitter stick oh my gosh
that's just like crazy so very
interesting very very interesting kind
of want to put that on my eye how do I
look I didn't even do it evenly I feel
like I should wear these our rest of the
time Tyler's currently oh my gosh
Tyler's currently our neighbors are
having a like holiday party and since
I've been sick I'm like I don't know I
just I felt wrong like going out and I
know I'm not contagious I'm not but I
don't know I was kind of like Taylor I
think I'm gonna sit this one out I feel
like I should just kind of relax at home
in PJs and just actually relax I did
take a little bit of a nap earlier too
anyway I feel like I should be wearing
those so when he comes home from next
door
he'll be like well I guess you figured
it out alright um the other thing is
from flower beauty let me flip it is it
says it's their lip collection fall 2017
hey drew barrymore she's like them owner
and proprietor I don't know I think she
owns the brand if not she's the
spokesperson for it something like that
but I think she has more to do with it
than just spokesperson um so looks wow
wow wow oh these look pretty so these
are their mix and matte lip duos whoa
there we go
so these it says creamy velvet matte
lipstick on one side 3d pearlized gloss
on the other interesting hmm a drive
down there tickled pink it's kind of
looking a little darker on camera but
there's the the lipstick is like thick
matte it was I mean it's creamy though
but it's wow so that's that line I've
not heard of that so that I don't know
if that is new
but then these glosses I think are their
miracle matte liquid lips let's see yeah
so let's watch this one in the shade
blush or nude blush okay so that was
super creamy almost like a whipped like
formula I'm curious to see how it dries
down but none of these have an offensive
smell which is good but you also know
that I'm very tired of matte lipstick
why are brands still coming out with new
lines of matte lipstick we are all
moving off but this just caught my eye
it says I wanted something non-drying
uncomfortable so supposedly they're soft
and cushiony I'll be the judge of that
so I'll let you guys know then there's
another little drawer of I guess it's
their petal pout lip colors whoa oh and
some lip liners let's try one of these
hey it's right there it's in the shade
pink dusk
this formula felt more like classic
lipstick like but you kind of had to
pull on it to get it to like show up I
don't know I guess I'm spoiled with
lipstick but like I feel like like I
really liked the way the satin one went
on from that duo that we just did right
there so this one kind of felt like
let's try one of these lip liners it's a
swatch this is like the red one petal
pop in cherry that's the shade yeah
that's alright I mean it's certainly red
but that was a couple swatches back and
forth feel like it feels like any old
any other lip liner from the drugstore
it doesn't really stand out I guess but
again I want to try these on and truly
let you know yeah it doesn't really say
anything super special about that there
so I've been tricked by these for sure
let me know you know I don't think I
would do a dedicated video on just these
have I done a video of like best and
worst the flower beauty I think I have I
can link that below if you're curious to
be honest I used to not like their lip
colors because they you just have this
very offensive floral smell and if
you're sensitive to smell or you just
don't like floral I mean it was like
true floral to me I just don't really
like that so I I couldn't wear them it
would make me sick to myself but none of
these have that smell thank goodness
they
I've heard a lot of people's cries but
let me know if you'd like I don't know
maybe I'll mention them in some other
video we'll see that's exciting though I
love trying new stuff in the other box
this is butter LONDON and Pantone I
guess the color of the year for next
year is ultra violet he's gonna sent me
like a swatch it's really really pretty
color
however wow this is a lot of purple so
we've got one of their uh Peng I love
the butter LONDON
glaze and I gloss is one of my favorite
products I've been talking about a lot
recently let's watch this this is in the
shade ultra violet let's see but what
you need to understand is that this
product is weird it literally feels like
pudding but that is what it looks like
when you when you you know swatch it
it's so pretty all of the products are
so pretty and I've been talking a lot
recently about them and saying like I
love it because there are some shades
that have glitter and I'm not noticing
glitter fall out when I use them but
some of you guys were commenting saying
like what are you talking about I have a
lot of glitter fall so I haven't seen
that on mine I don't know if I have an
old formula or a new formula or the
primers I'm using but I feel like I
never use the same primer twice with
them so I don't know that that's
necessarily it but I haven't noticed
that so I'll keep playing with them some
more and see now that I'm hyper aware of
it if I'm you know if I notice any
fallout but I really haven't but the
rest of these are just like these are
some purple lip glosses things like that
I'll kind of play with them see if I
want to keep and they have a bunch of
the purple nail polishes which is fun I
got to wipe all these off the glaze and
I glosses you do like have to like get
off because it's some work any of these
I did end up watching them so the bottom
row are they're liquid lipsticks and the
top are there what do they actually call
these of course it doesn't say plush
brush and lip gloss so that's kind of
what they look like I don't know I'm
gonna try it out and there's also a
liquid a glaze in lustrous liner that's
kind of in that purpley shade as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
