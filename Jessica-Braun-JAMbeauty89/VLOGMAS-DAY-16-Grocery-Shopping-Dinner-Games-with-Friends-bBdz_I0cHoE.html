people crazy anyway I've got like eight
hours of sleep last night but I
literally feel like I need to like go
back to bed but you know when your body
wakes up and it's like I'm done can't
sleep anymore I'm like really
you sure body cuz you look like you
could anyway I was just thinking about
something last night
Tyler was gone for a couple hours and
like I actually like I had the luxury of
time where I was just like in my room
I'd finished editing some video so I was
like okay I'm done editing for the night
like I cannot edit anymore and I was
just like watching videos and I feel
like I never have the time to just sit
and watch videos but when I watch videos
and I know I'm not alone I can't just
sit and watch and it's the same with TV
I don't just sit and watch I need to
either be eating or drinking something
or I need to be like doing something my
hands like folding laundry or knitting
that's never what I'm doing but you know
what I'm saying I need to be doing
something else like I almost feel guilty
just sitting and watching something and
I can't figure out why like why am i
wired that way because I know when I was
younger I would sit and like watch
Nickelodeon you know whatever it and
just be watching it although I do
remember that my brother and I used to
cut lemons in half what do we use to
call it we made up a lot of games we
were very weird it checks out though we
would cut a lemon in half and we would
suck on it and like lick on it and run
around in circles around our coffee
table while watching like Power Rangers
we had oh we were weird anyway um so
those were the things we did so again I
guess even then I didn't just watch TV I
would run around in circles sucking on
lemons I wonder if anyone else is the
same though are you you feel so weird
and I wish I didn't feel guilty cuz
sometimes I just want to relax and watch
TV but like I can't do it Tyler says he
can't do it either I don't know what's
wrong with us I just feel like I always
need to be productive and it's like the
weirdest curse ever so I wouldn't work
to break that because I need to enjoy
the pleasure of doing nothing which I
guess watching TV is anyway why did I
bring up this story why are you guys
letting me ramble like this
oh I had the luxury of doing it and I so
while I was watching it I I need to
switch hands hold on okay so while I was
watching videos I had my phone in my
hand because I was watching on my
computer and I was like scrolling
through Twitter and Instagram and
replying to some things and you know
replying to some comments finally I was
like okay like I've run out of things to
do and it made me laugh just thinking
about and this morning I woke up
thinking about that thinking about when
you've run out of things to do on the
Internet it's such a funny idea because
it's like there's so much to do on the
end there's so many blogs you can read
but there are just certain sites I like
to look at and enjoy and that's it and I
don't branch out so again that's like
another thing I'm curious what are
things you do like when you're bored on
the internet like are there fun websites
are there amazing blogs I should be fine
I really don't read blogs and I would
love to start one of my own one day no
no too busy but I would love to start
something like that one day just for fun
just cuz I do like to write I take
pictures anyway and I feel I could be
something that would be very natural to
me but I would love to follow some so if
you have any really good ones I feel
like that's a new world to be you and
just other sites that are fun when
you've run out of things to just check
the mail we got a bunch of them I love
Erin Condren and so we got a bunch of
canvas prints of my Familia we're giving
to most of the people in my family we
might order more for some people that
live out of town and like ship it to him
but we figure just a nice gift Tyler
took a nice picture of us and everyone
was in it which is like rare I'll give
you a quick glance wow that's a lot of
people okay so I wanted to show you our
cute little advent calendar Tyler do you
know if we showed this yet how he's
moving our compost outside very exciting
stuff he is excited no composter though
it's cute
anyway where's little advent calendar I
think I bought it on HauteLook at some
point I just love it and actually this
is our first year using it but what are
we at day 16 the things are big enough
that I could totally fit the little
charm that goes in it and like a
chocolate coz to me I'm like Oh advent
calendar I mean there's chocolate right
and so I figured
that would just be fun especially once
we have kiddos share the chocolate with
um and then these little bears I'm
drinking my smoothie again trying to
kick this colds booty um but these
little bears I think he sent like his
aunt you know you could like buy um
plain and you like you can paint them I
don't remember if these were the ones
she painted or if it was a different set
we have but either way I think they're
so cute I just love it little winter
Christmassy bears and then I think I got
this at like Bath and Body Works at some
point and then here's a little pro tip
kind of we don't like we love candles
but we hate spending a lot of money on
candles I'm sure everyone feels the same
way and they get so expensive but we
also know that like there's certain cows
like Yankee candle candles it sounds
ridiculous Yankee Candles are like they
really have a nice scent throw like if
you get the good ones what am I saying
am I making any sense I like most none I
know anyway so what we did is last year
they were on sale and we bought a few
and so we burned them you know for deer
in the Christmas season and then we just
put them away with our Christmas decor
because we were like well we're not just
gonna keep burning him I'd rather just
pull them back out and use them the next
season since they're all very kind of
holiday specific cents so it's kind of
nice at the rate we're burning it we
might even feel like use it next year I
don't know clearly we need to trim the
wig because we've got some little
furniture but I love this little area
okay so number seven just sent me a
bunch of stuff and I've already put a
lot of it away a lot of it I'm gonna
save to giveaway because it's a lot of
products I already had which I love
number seven actually I was like me and
I haven't used my favorite foundation in
a while the number seven stave perfect
or one of my favorites so I'm gonna use
that today but they have a new bronzer
shade or at least it's new to me so I
had already had caramel I love these
bronzers they're like the perfect amount
of pigment but this is the new one it's
called maple I love the name and it's
really really light but warm whereas
this one in huh let me swatch these on
my hand okay so on the left is caramel
or caramel the middle one is the new one
to me maple and then on the right is
golden sand May
looks like it's the lightest out of all
of them and they're all warm tone I mean
they're meant to be bronzers but what's
weird is the golden sand
I feel like used to be lighter this is a
new one they set and I don't know if
it's reformulated or if they redid the
shade but look how much darker it looks
but then like when you compare it to
caramel caramel definitely looks darker
so I'm gonna use maple today I'm so
excited because that looks like totally
a shade for my skintone that would work
really well the one in the middle I just
love these and the packaging is so
pretty so this is my NYX epic ink liner
that I love and it had some like little
wispy hairs I just took some like
eyebrow scissors and cut them off as
close as I could and so then I applied
my liner and I'm like oh my gosh it's
perfect
so just something to keep in mind like I
could maybe get a little closer but
those like the way I apply liner won't
end up getting all over my eye those
little wispy so I just thought it's like
the simplest thing and I'm sure some of
you guys already do that but if you have
really good brows so these are from
tweezerman
I freaking love these you can get pretty
close to cutting it and then they're not
long enough to actually I can mess up
the rest of your eye because the the
formula there's nothing wrong with it
but every one so now I'll put the cap on
wrong and it'll Bend back a one tiny
brush hair and I come pletely for God
there's my sudafed Thank You sudafed for
making me feel better
um anyway I completely forgot that I own
these cover FX custom cover drops I got
him in the shade in ten because both of
the stay perfect foundations I have are
just a little too dark for me right now
I have cool I agree more my V so I mixed
up and I was like oh no so then I put
this in perfect whoa I went full red I'm
watching Emily Noelle of course I am
I did some I did a red look kind of look
like someone punched me in the eye
trying to see if it looks any better in
my other lighting we're about to go
grocery shopping people will be like wow
where's she going I don't know if I like
it oh well well I was trying something
new
so I need a blow-dry my hair really
quickly it's almost dry um there are
some clothes on and we are gonna go to
do some very very quick grocery shopping
because Tyler's wanting to finish our
class as much as he can too
it's really gotten pushed by the wayside
just with stuff going on and I think our
good friends Ben and Emily are bringing
us dinner tonight because they knew I
was kind of under the weather a bit and
that we had to cancel our trip and they
want Ralphie to have his toys but little
do they know that Pinocchio has
completely ruined the toys they sent for
Ralph completely which I knew what
happened so Tyler we're gonna get some
some new toys for Ralphie and let
Pinocchio play with him for a few hours
but then take him away so he gets his
smell all over him then Ralph will want
them I hope this is making sense but we
feel bad he like actually ruined that
he's just he he does what we call
beagling he beagles something meaning he
freaking tears it apart
anyone else have dogs that just like
holy moley they like love toys and they
ruin them anyway I guess that's just
what dogs do because we're cute we stop
art this mire that we go to the grocery
store has a Starbucks in it very
problematic I love it though so we
always get Starbucks before he's looking
for some tools very exciting I'll look
at the 3m stuff I don't know my teacher
3m is exciting
like Christmas sweater okay like if you
were going to a public sweater party
there a sandwich
well chimney wings mustache but in this
call I don't know reduce fiddly paws
oh wow look how healthy you are oh my
goodness yeah good ah
alrighty so our friends Ben and Emily
are gonna be here very soon and um we're
just gonna hang out with them for a few
hours which would be nice I'm back in my
room oh one of you guys told me if you
like put a post-it in front of the thing
it's like a sensor and so when you move
away from the mirror for a few seconds
it turns off which I like but when I'm
filming I'm like what filming you know
what I mean well I guess I am filming
now anyway um you see all red under my
noses Oh Jesse I am actually feeling a
lot better
my throat still kind of hurts and
Scratchy and there's definitely stuff
going on but I feel more like myself
this weekend I'm so glad I've been
sleeping a lot which I'm also glad to
have the luxury of time for so yeah I'm
looking forward we'll try to vlog while
they're here and also Ralph's owners Ben
who you may know music garbage we were
baby oh yeah my name is like crazy cool
Ralph has all of his toys spread out in
every room over there he was so mad he
takes all of them with oh my got us for
Christmas that was literally the most
perfect

playing how did I get eight of his toys
I've never pulled this off before in my
life

difference hey what we were trying to do
