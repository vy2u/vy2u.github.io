I'm drinking another smoothie starting
to feel better day by day like I always
say I'll shut up about it
I always like double fist I've got
coffee and a green smoothie very
exciting stuff I'm still drinking the
creme brulee coffee from all these it's
so good and I was laughing because
yesterday we was talking to Emily and
she was like all this stuff is from all
these like they she they had made I
don't know if we said but Emily made
taco soup for us and and then she
brought dessert and it was like a
chocolate cake bought from all these
numerous delicious but she we were just
talking about how awesome all theses and
like how cheap thing is there it's crazy
and how like they'll have variety with
just random stuff like she was talking
about hummus I think and how one lady
was remarking on how I can get right
Erna maybe this guacamole yet record
Rocko moly and spicy guacamole like they
have options with their like things and
that's what does anyone know what I'm
saying I don't even know what I'm saying
anyway so the plan for today I was
sitting in bed making like a to-do list
on my phone for today because I want to
be super-dee-duper productive so I
didn't edit vlogmas yesterday the day
just got away from us grocery shopping
and then having them over so I'm gonna
try to get to vlogmas i up today well
today them filming it and then what else
we are oh I need to get laundry done
he's his like mo is I'm getting the
closet done it will be done so I hope he
does I'm so excited but I know it he's
got a lot of work ahead of him cuz it's
a lot in there and I'll see if I can
help like I the big things I mean I I'd
be a little bit of help but I think and
he's even said like you're not gonna be
as much help as you think it's kind of
just easier just to you know I'm I've
got the one track going you know I'm
just cruising anyway but once he starts
putting like the accessory like shelves
and stuff I might be able to help we'll
see but I Pinocchio
he was very exhausted after Ralph left
last night anyway so that's kind of our
plan being super-dee-duper productive
and I don't think will you have any big
plans today which is nice I have one
more week of working and then Christmas
break or winter break for two weeks I'm
excited okay so now I'm making an
English muffin because of course I need
more than just this movie so I'm making
English muffin and I ripped the paper
towel off and I'm like huh that's funny
last time I ripped it there and it
Tyler looked at and said oh my gosh it
looks like the shape of Indiana here's
the other piece I was missing I think
that is fuller yes it gets up staring at
very very exciting laundry day at my
household I'm watching Smith March it's
her like yearly best of beauty 2017 I
love her I'll link her channel in her
video below um but yeah I kind of love
laundry days though because it's such a
refreshing like like especially like
clean towels and socks you know all that
stuff it sounds so dumb but I'm sure I'm
not alone in that and just loving it
mm-hm Ralph accidentally left one of his
toys but it okay says mine now is that
yogurt on your nose again you got yogurt
nose he said I always have yogurt nose
me play it ready ready okay very
exciting stuff oh what a valiant run so
Tyler's hard at work on the closet can I
show them progress so far enough yeah
okay yeah so this is it so far it's so
hard to like get the whole thing so far
very exciting yeah oh yeah what all do
we get there's like drawers and shelves
and hanging spots and yeah okay thanks
tough so I'm certain there'll be another
one that size on my side over there and
then who'll be able to but you even got
these like
scared to the wall everything they're
not going anywhere which is nice because
of course when we move in a thousand
years we're not taking these with us do
themselves okay I had to show you guys
three shirts that I ordered from Etsy
and they just shipped today finally I
ordered him a few weeks ago but like
when I ordered it it even said like it's
not going to ship until 15 through 17 so
it just shipped I think actually
yesterday they were each $25 they're
from the Royal or pixie dolls something
oh yeah
pixie dust tease so this one's like
green or mint I guess and it says
shining shimmering splendid from Aladdin
and then this one's from Beauty and the
Beast I want adventure in the Great Wide
somewhere oh my gosh and this one was
called it just says raised on Ashman and
Minkin who are like the lyricist
composer other way around no that's the
correct way there is this a composer for
a lot of Disney movies like all the ones
I'm pretty sure they were like Beauty
and the Beast uh-huh Aladdin feel he was
like all of the ones that I grew up with
I don't know if it was all the Little
Mermaid for sure anyway so I just
thought that was so much fun so I'm
quite exciting they look like they might
not be fitted which i think is good cuz
that'll be comfy you know what I mean
you could tuck it in if you want you
don't have to I just thought they were
so cute and I was like okay $25 apiece
if I were to buy shirts like this in
Disney which please these and Disney
would be like $40 just because they're
so like kind of trendy so not only would
they be more expensive but they always
like fit small which you know I just
have to go a size that no big deal but I
just feel like this is such a better
deal they're probably more comfortable
I'm just so excited I love and
supporting small business that's always
a good thing
so I will link these if I can find them
I'm staring at him but assuming they're
not like sold out or anything I'll link
them below cuz I'm definitely gonna be
wearing some of these on our next trip
here in a few weeks to Disney World
okay Loki I kind of love this in my room
we just set it in of course this is not
these are bathroom rugs we just washed
but like I love the color of this it's
supposed to go downstairs we put one in
our bedroom we thought two would fit
they did not they're from Ikea
and I can I can link this chair below I
think it was like 160 bucks so we bought
two of them and only one fit in our
bedroom so we're gonna put this
downstairs but right now the Christmas
trees in the way of where it could could
fit in our living room so we just kind
of brought it up here I think I might
just keep it up here and just get like a
cute little like maybe like gold and
glass like table or something because I
could totally sit there and edit on my
laptop just for kind of a change of
seating cuz I usually if I'm on my
laptop I usually sit there and of course
if I'm on my desktop I'm over there but
don't you guys think it's kind of cute I
mean beyond the fact that I just need to
kind of straighten up my room I really
like this chair and it's ridiculously
comfortable very random thing but these
are the best pens in the world I have
loved them for years you have to get the
bold 1.4 millimeters because Lobo okay
you will love these if you like like
thick juicy writing if you like really
thin fine points then of course you'll
hate these but like for me I struggle to
find pens that write really thick leave
and these do so every time the only
colors I don't love are like this lime
green like if I'm grading papers with it
it's really hard to see but like the
purple the pink is so pretty the dark
purple the dark green I mean they're all
freakin amazing
I've bought so freakin many of these use
these all the way up bought more packs
but this one I actually did not buy for
school I bought for myself to have like
for work YouTube work I don't know why
that's in quotes it is work but um but
you know for any time I'm actually
writing things down which I do a lot but
I'm always grabbing just random pens
like Jessica treat y'all selves but in a
couple dollars and get your favorite
pens for home too
so I know that's so random but they're
so good if you've never tried them you
will love also my Physicians Formula
order came in and I've been trying this
stuff out it's so much fun so this there
I'm spotlight illuminating primer
look so much like the Becca backlight
priming filter now you'll probably
struggle to find this in stores for a
while since it's so new so just I mean I
like I told you guys I bought it on
physicians formulas website which I've
never done before but it was all
packaged really well I got this because
so many of you guys recommended it the
brake booster oil elixir this is a
coconut water primer spray serum that's
kind of like brightening this reminds me
of the milk cooling thing I'd use this
this morning and when I open this like
this evening I put it on a mug oh I
think I like the Physicians Formula one
even more than the milk one and of
course it's like half the price
I bought this powder I already love but
I bought the matte version it's a powder
foundation and I really really like it
oh the brush hairs are coming through
like you that versus me up anyway
this was something funny though it's
their low velvet foundation look how
dark that is it says this is an ivory
ivory what so I kind of swiped it on my
face it's like a cream foundation no it
is very very deep to be called ivory so
it's just kind of interesting I don't
know if it was a mistake or maybe that
is the lightest they make but ivory is
not quite the right name for something
like that and then a couple other things
I'll be trying out there healthy lips I
tried on they were pretty comfortable
some eye primer duos eye so far wasn't
super impressed with in than that
mascara I'm gonna try out tomorrow so
very exciting stuff of course I'm gonna
try these out for a few weeks and then
do a full on review video and let you
guys know my final thoughts oh this is a
rose organic rose oil lip polish it's
like a lip scrub and this little
adorable spatula comes with it it's so
cute this is part of my side slowly but
surely part of his side and he's still
working out there and he was watching
Futurama handsome
I know this is so exciting that this is
gonna be fun the violas oh and we got a
swift about the over dial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
