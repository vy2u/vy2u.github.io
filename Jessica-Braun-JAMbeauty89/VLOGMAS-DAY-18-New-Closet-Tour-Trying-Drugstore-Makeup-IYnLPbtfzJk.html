I'm just a big ol mess guys I'm a
hormonal mess
so today oh my gosh I'm trying out so
many new things um this one is a pretty
quickly when it comes to like the pain
of it you know what I mean
because I use the Sunday Riley drunk oh
my gosh I keep trying to say drunk I
love it
Sunday Riley good genes treatment and I
swear to you it killed it but then this
one cropped up and this one still hurts
so I'm like okay something's still
feeding that that's so gross stop
talking about it anyway so I will deal
with that later but today I am trying
out a couple things so I'm trying out
the Physicians Formula bright booster I
put that on it sinks in very quickly
this is basically it's an oil elixir so
it's kind of like all the facial oils
I've been using I'm using it much the
same way to help with my dry skin of
course it's also got good stuff in it
for my skin but it also is just super
super moisturizing so I put this on
first and I really I mean it sunk in
really quickly so I'm excited to keep
trying that and then I also am trying
out this illuminating primer called
spotlight it is just like let me see if
I can grab it
fairness the it is just like the Becca
backlight priming filter which you can
tell I really like I've been using I
mean like very similar the consistency I
think the Beca ones maybe a little
thicker but the look at the end is
exactly like this I mean it is dead-on
now the spot light one has a really
clean laundry scent but like a sweet
clean I don't know how to describe it I
really like the scent like I was rubbing
it on I was like oh my gosh this smells
amazing
now of course fragrance can also
irritate your skin so you have to kind
of know your skin typically my skin's
okay with fragrance and of course
fragrance can come from different
ingredients souza who knows but I really
like that it smells so I'm very excited
about this and kind of testing those out
I'm working on a future Duke video Duke
videos take me months to prepare for
because I just come up with them on my
own and it's so funny because sometimes
I'll be
I came up with this dupe on my own and
then someone be like no you idiot
everyone's already known about that I'm
like dang it but either way it's more
fun that way to me to feel like I've
discovered them on my own so I think I
might list is that like three or four
products and I like to have like eight
to ten before I do a dupe this video so
I'll be working for the next few months
on it but I love doing this so very
exciting I'll link these below and then
I'm also trying out these this like
brush set
Dehlia tool set over it's called their
golden triangle oh my gosh these brushes
okay so first of all I'm really picky
with brushes which is funny cuz I'm not
like a makeup artist I have no reason to
be but I just am I've tried so many so
like the brushes have like this
triangular shape to the handle and
there's something about it that's so
comfortable to hold but these just feel
really nice I've tried a lot of deli
impressions over the years and I have
found some of my favorites and then some
that are just like other ones that I'm
like but these feel incredible so this
is like their DF powder blending ones DF
I don't know
o duo-fiber it didn't take me Latin that
long if I hear it out but then they have
in the set they have like these eye
brushes so if these are available
already I will link them below but this
set first of all this holder I'm like I
am now in the season of getting really
cool brush holders like in that cool so
I'll be trying those up too okay so a
lot of you guys are asking about the
shade maple that I mentioned the other
day I have it on it's I know I really
like the shade I'm just now seeing in
here this foundation did not cover very
much so I'm trying the new Physicians
Formula healthy foundation I mix there
are two lightest shades which look the
exact same I didn't need to make them
even putting it Ottoman okay these
literally are the same shade
anyway it really does not cover a lot
which I mean I don't think my skin looks
bad but I mean now it is very
reminiscent of the Neutrogena Hydra
boost now what's comical about these is
that they're not this one I think is a
little bit more hydrating it says it's
got a brightening complex little block I
don't think this is super hydrating I
thought it would be now in all fairness
I usually blend my foundation with a
Beauty Blender of some kind or a beauty
sponge I should say and today I used a
brush I use one of the New Delhi Matilda
the 9:57 and I did like it but I think
sometimes when I do that it just ends up
just settling on my dry skin really
quickly so I'm obviously gonna keep
trying these I'm gonna try it with the
sponge because that's my typical way so
I'm a bad scientist right now I started
out really roughly with something I
don't even normally use so I'll keep you
guys posted I don't know I don't know
okay the boxes were recycled if you
remember from yesterday let me set my
water down mm-hmm it is time so here's
my side I haven't put anything in it
just yet so I've got shoe shells down
there okay lies I have one pair of shoes
in there some drawers some shelving a
place to hang like my outfit for the
next day here cuz we had that space and
then that's where I can hang clothes
that can go all the way down and I
getting more clothes here I know it's
kind of hard to see in this lighting and
then here I can put my jewelry in here
there are three of them I'm like instead
of in a jewelry box so what I need to
get like this is Tyler's and they sell
these at Aldi what all these at IKEA so
I need to get three of those to be in my
drawer so I go put my sunglasses jewelry
etc and then three more drawers these go
a little bit deeper because of how deep
these are pants hangers there and then
this is his side so he's got like his
suits there he's had this closet monkey
forever he was saying these are easy to
adjust and buy new parts too
so he was saying he needs more shoe
shelves I'm like yeah you totally do
so um he's thinking he might adjust this
a little bit maybe raise it up even and
then have more shoe shelves down here
but he's got some drawers and he just
has a couple they're like he's got his
ties I don't know if he cares if I'm
showing anyway so all is good we're
gonna look for a baskets kind of like
those that would fit along this upper
shelving so like offseason clothes we
can kind of throw in there you know in
the winter I put sandals and a baskets I
don't need I'm in the summer I could put
scarves in a basket so my project
tonight
is to fill this sucker I'm so excited I
kind of want to like take my time and
like enjoy it you guys know what I mean
like I'm the kind of person that like
because I love reorganizing and
decluttering I want to like take my time
and like enjoy the process of like
putting everything away but I'm also
like but it's also our school night and
like I've gotta go to bed in a few hours
so we'll see how much I actually get
done but I love this part so I think I
might as I go you know everything I hang
up I'm gonna kind of look at and really
think like okay do I really need this or
should I declutter it you know cuz I
think we have well we definitely have
less space to hang things up which i
think is a good thing because that makes
me curate my closet even more but yeah
yeah I'm so I've been looking forward to
this for so long T dokie
I'm getting somewhere slowly but surely
again like shorts those are eventually
gonna be in a basket but slowly getting
some stuff but I've got at least all of
my hanging clothes in here and this
really doesn't inspire me like I have
way too many dresses way too many way
too many can I say that enough way too
many okay so it does inspire me to get
rid of some stuff anywho this is so much
fun
I'm just jamming to Lord my favorite of
course oh and I've got some pants
hanging here toe and I might split this
pant thing because I really you know I
only have some and my jeans for example
I have up there and then lay this is a
problem I have so many leggings I wear
them almost every single day it's crazy
and so I wear like tunics and
anyway I'm a big ol mess but so like I
think if he's had this half and I use
this half because rowdy is like I don't
even have these on right I don't think I
think you just loop it through there but
frankly I'm too lazy in the morning I
want to be able to just pull it up so
that's that so I'm using it how I want
but he has it on right but I figure I
don't think I need any more than this
maybe one more maybe but that would
still give him all of these and he was
like these are the line pants I really
hang up like really you sure he's got a
lot of pants but anyway um so just just
some thoughts as I go along
okay the deed is done got my little
animal friends up there by my hats so
just a quick or overview a person is
I've just got jeans and leggings boy I
wear a lot of leggings I'm realizing
Disney shirts and just other fun
t-shirts I have a lot of those swimsuits
and other shirts socks and undergarments
shoes I have my bigger boots that didn't
fit like vertically over there and then
I have like for the long section I have
my dresses and like thicker heavier
shirts and then my lighter more blouse
like shirts not all of them are blouses
but and then broccoli broccoli sounds
good broccoli rabe I know time is flying
so my glasses are there and then you
already saw like my pants and Tyler's
bringing up a good point he's like
honestly I wish I could hang mine like
that like he was saying but once he
starts putting his on here the way they
overlap he's like I'm gonna have to put
one in and then one over so I can fit
two pair on each cuz his are just like
the legs of course they're just wider so
there's that and then over here these
top true top two will have my jewelry in
it and like I showed you over here I
want to get from Ikea these for myself
so I'd need two of those to be able to
set my jewelry so it's not moving all
around
I might get a third because this drawer
I just have my sunglasses most of these
are like cheapos from Target this is
like actually a nice pair but then I
have like extra wallets my actual
glasses glasses in just some empty cases
to be honest I can't believe I had that
money I got rid of a bunch and then I
found more in my car like oh my gosh and
then in here I have more undergarments
and tank tops my wintry things and hats
and then this I had all of these like um
travel like my packing cubes are back
there it looks like chaos but it's
somewhat organized actually but
basically just my travel makeup bags
things like that I mean I use all of
these all the time I recently declutter
all of this like my accessories and bags
and things I can link those videos below
if you're curious but this is actually
much much pared down so I only have like
three or four makeup bags here and then
like larger toiletry bags things like
that so that is it it didn't take as
long as I thought I want to say it took
like a couple hours I wasn't gonna put
my closet friends up there because it
was like oh it kind of ruins the look
but they bring me so much joy it was
like Jessica who cares you and I are the
only ones that are like coming in here
so they bring you joy put them in there
my figment I'm so excited to go to
Disney again Oh
anywho so up here we're gonna like I
mentioned get baskets and Tyler's gonna
add another shelf up above this cuz we
had way more vertical room than we
thought but other than that holy moly
Thank You IKEA no they're not sponsoring
this I wish and this would have been
free I think but I'm so excited oh and I
told you this is where I can hang
outfits right did I mention that I'm
like weirdly excited to wake up tomorrow
morning and pick out an outfit and stuff
does anyone get like that when you have
something new like this year I can't
wait to like wake up and use it
sometimes I feel that way about makeup
like oh my gosh I can't wait to wake up
and like use this palette tomorrow
Pinocchio and I are taking a break right
yeah
so he just ate dinner he's a happy boy
I can him feel your ears are cold
because you went outside so I'm a happy
boy Oh cozy just this is like
therapeutic to me to like play with his
ears give him squatches whitetail no he
said well I will he need us why now

broccoli ready doctor baby oh yeah we
