judge me because I can't control you but
I am embarrassed to say that I ordered
more makeup from Ulta and it came in the
mail I have never bought so much stuff
in like a court the course of like a
month or two that I have in the past
month or two of my life
I'm not joking you but I think because
I'm kind of in this Renaissance of my
channel where I feel like I'm coming up
with new ideas
/ finding new youtubers that you know I
can shout out and steal their ideas no
I'm just kidding but I mean you know
like that's how this all works you know
I was thinking the other day I'm like I
wonder where like empties and like
monthly favorites like who was the very
first person to do those because if
obviously that's the way ideas work they
catch on on like wildfire and then
everyone starts doing them and then they
just become like staples so anyway I'm
getting off track I bought a lot of
stuff and it's all like the most random
stuff I was like in the depths of the
Ulta website just like freaking finding
stuff I'm trying a palette I obviously
it looks a little crazy because a my
eyes are tired be my eyes are tired and
see my eyes are tired but also they
always are but also I haven't put like
liner mascara it's this persona persona
but I'm pretty sure it's a Osuna I just
try just what accident was that Jessica
anyway their identity palette right up
my alley it's a lot more cool tone which
is like old-school Jesse there are still
some warm tones in it though it's kind
of like the perfect mix oh my gosh so I
have that on my eyes mixed with I'm
giving it another chance this is the
Stila shimmer and glow I thought because
it was not the glitter and glow because
those I had glitter for I know a lot of
people didn't but I did so I got rid of
like the one that I had bought a while
ago but the shimmering glow I thought oh
it'll just be like shimmery but not like
no glitter there's freaking glitter in
that look why then this is the glitter
and glow like it's no different
I was kind of upset but regardless I do
think it's pretty I think but this is
the shade Jezebel it's like a pretty
rose gold classic bronze II actually
more maybe more bronze either Muslim
anyway so I bought a bunch more stuff
I think I'll film a video I might give
you a sneak peek later because I'm
trying a lot of Sherriff out but I just
wanted to let you know that I am
embarrassed well but what I was saying
is I feel like because I'm going through
this like Renaissance on my channel I
feel like I'm so inspired to like try a
lot of new products products I haven't
heard talked about products I have heard
talked about new products old products
you know just tons of stuff so I have
some things that I've just I've heard no
one talked about that I wanted to try
and so I just thought that was kind of
fun maybe I do a video like products I'm
trying that no one else's or like
products I'm trying that no one else is
talking about yet I don't know I don't
know and just give me some ideas you
guys came up with the best title ideas
for some videos I've like mentioned in
different vlog missus vlog Messiah and I
thank you guys for it cuz you guys can
put things into words better than I can
which is good alrighty so I think the
cool tone look I even done like well
maybe I have but I haven't done a more
cool to him look in a while it's given
me like old-school YouTube vibes for
myself like myself on my old YouTube
videos I literally hated warm shadows
for the longest time and now no maybe
they're having a revival for me who
knows alright I'm being weird today
today's like a beach-themed at school
because they're doing like a beachy
readin thing it's really cute and our
bosses are awesome and they are giving
us the gift of extra time today so with
our prep period the kiddos are gonna be
reading in the hallway throw a little
beach towels it's so cute I got to get
pictures and so they are my two bosses
are going to be supervising them while
we have like an extra 40 minutes of like
prep time so instead of just 50 minutes
we have 90 I'm like oh my gosh I can get
so much grading done and put comments in
for report cards they are like thinking
of all the things I'm gonna get done so
I'm really excited and that's an awesome
very invaluable gifts for us so I'll
I'm gonna get to get to work and I'll
check in with you guys later yeah one
more thing I bought my very first dose
of colors product I don't know why I'm
saying it like that because it's my
first because it wasn't sold at Ulta and
I I've told you guys and I know I'm not
alone I very rarely buy like off-site
like okay Jess you need to clean that up
anyway I just put this on this is that
very popular one in stone my lips are so
dark as it is though this didn't do a
lot to them but I'm seeing that like I
feel like I need to line because it's
looking a little slop slop without it
all right it ended up being a very long
day Tyler he had been doing stuff he was
out and about and then when I got home
from work
we both he had a little cheese date set
up so we ate our cheese and talked and
then we were both like let's just go
take a nap so he just took like a nap
that was supposed to be 45 minutes ended
up being like an hour and then an hour
of waking up and laughing and talking in
bed I'm like so here we are it's like
6:45 so I need to go edit some video
making some like coffee I'm gonna do
like half-caff half decaf something like
that just wake myself up a little bit
for a little while I really don't have
the problem like if I drink too much
caffeine in the evening I usually can go
to sleep just fine
but I still try not to drink too much
other than that this breakout is like
really bad don't look at it I'm
embarrassed Tyler do you remember the
first YouTube video you ever watch yeah
we were I know - well I know YouTube
star 2005 right I don't know what I'm
seeing right I know it did I don't
remember like I remember just like you
know randomly you'd watch them but it's
never like I would go to YouTube and be
like let's just watch a bunch of it it
would be like oh I want to see this
music video you know whatever yeah
I'm sure some dumb ding fries are done
video games are dunno were those on
YouTube at that timer was it just on
like ebon the world or whatever your die
was that around before I think that was
after you I don't know like I'm
connoisseur I know all things so this is
so crazy because I literally the reason
I was asking him was because I was
editing the video YouTube
what is it YouTube beauty community tag
that'll it'll be up by the time you're
seeing this vlog I'm so I can link it
below but it was I was talking I don't
even know what made me think of it but I
was talking about something to do with
YouTube and watching videos and stuff
and like how I started watching it I
don't know and it just made me think
I wonder cuz I remember what I was
searching for when I very first saw a
YouTube beauty video for the very first
time I remembered the youtuber it was
because I ended up subscribing and just
watching a ton of her videos and I
remember the product I was looking up I
just found it hold on was sammich who
still has a channel umm I actually just
recibir in this window over here but um
it was this video it was I was looking
at this Lancome because it would have
been my first high-end foundation I'd
ever bought in my best friend Sarah who
you guys have met in an earlier vlog
miss she had told me about it cuz like I
think a woman she was nannying for wore
it and Sarah's like oh my gosh it looks
so pretty so Sarah tried it and I was
like well let me look up a review like
that's a lot of money and so I was just
googling like what people thought of it
and then I saw video on like video who
are they gonna show it on and then I
watched this and it's all history from
there and I have savage to think super
nostalgic tonight I just looked up that
make bomb Cape spelled it wrong makeup
collection Elle Fowler remember her
she's been like gone for like a year
from you two anyway whoo that makes me
want to watch that one but I've been
watching that I remember this video so
well because it was like such a huge
piece of furniture and like anyway it
was like all Mac makeup it's so
funny to watch now just crazy how much
times have changed but also they haven't
at all five years ago oh my gosh anyway
so I'm just having a really like
nostalgic night and I'm really loving it
do you have any videos like that that
like you remember and like everyone
smile you'll like go back and watch I
know some of you guys have like
playlists of things that you'll just
like favorite videos and you'll just go
back and re-watch those I think that's
so cool I feel like I should start doing
that cuz it is fun and like when you
feel like you've run out of things to
watch then you just re-watch old
favorites okay it's one of these kinds
of nights because it is 8:40 p.m. and we
were both so busy doing stuff that we
were just like oh yeah we should eat we
were gonna do like a healthy me or like
yeah sweet potatoes and something else
no this is what happens when you wait
till I'm here oh wow
but this is one of our favorite well we
just love Hawaiian pizza but foreshadows
is pretty darn good they like no one
ever talks about for shoutout I mean
who's talking about frozen pizza that
much but like you hear about DiGiorno
which is also delicious I do love
DiGiorno pizzas but for China is really
good too um so that is the plan and
Tyler went to Goodwill today and he said
he was gonna show me some of his stuff
so I'm kind of excited to see that oh
and also this stuff is like this frozen
dog food and we don't use it for his
actual food we use it for treats when we
can find it and he loves it he freaking
loves this stuff
um you have to like we usually will
defrost like we'll put about this much
in like a ziplock and put that in the
fridge and he'll go through that over
the course of a week or so maybe a week
or two so we'll put it like in a little
ball like a treat ball he kicks around
or the treats fall out or we'll just use
it we use it a lot when we were kind of
training him ish
he walls just stuff tags and Pinocchio
airplane you know he's here like pounds
Mouse
thank you you play
Oh
Oh I bought it laundry ball his favorite
he wants us to fill that tree ball real
bad
we haven't even cracked open I was just
blogging about the bill Jack you can
crack that open air street wall where
did we get it like Meyer somewhere he
learns to pick it up and throw it so
beware of them fall out but yeah every
dog we've ever shown this to right away
it's the weirdest thing to dark
understand to keep rolling it around
treats go away but yeah pick it up and
throw it reset it broken we stop default
I got oh I tripped I got a lot of stuff
going on on my face today
all right time student it next to me too
I'm doing the patch ology flash patch i
jealous out of this one's like getting
in my eye just to kind of moisturize my
under eye and you only leave them on for
like five minutes and it comes with like
a ton 30 pairs so it's 60 of them and
then I'm also trying the Sephora algae
sleeping mask which comes like in a
little pot and you just kind of put it
all over and you sleep with it on and if
there's excess it says you can rinse it
off but like it says to apply a really
fine layer and I mean you're kind of
putting it on almost like a moisturizer
and it supposed to purify detoxify
because I need that but then on this one
that's still kind of like alive okay
that was gross I put on the
Mario Badescu drying lotion this is like
my last resort when it's taking forever
for something to die I don't like you
think because I do think it's really
harsh and it is I mean it's like alcohol
and other stuff in it but it's my last
resort thing when it's been like three
days and it's still like in pain I'm
like okay forget it I'm just doing it so
I know some people feel strongly about
that product anywho so we are gonna go
to bed for the night or at least here in
a few minutes and we'll see you tomorrow
bye
hey wait one more thing guys I had these
on the wrong way I don't want to restock
them just for now I'm just now
remembering that this is supposed to go
here and out oh my gosh oh my gosh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
