which is probably gonna be Lord and I
need to get okay so like when we
renovated our bathroom
we put everything in this guest room oh
my gosh and so I need to organize that
back into our bathroom and then get this
guest room I need to wash the sheets and
blankets and stuff because this is where
Sarah's gonna stay so I'm like okay I've
got a few hours I can do it I can do it
and just vacuum freshen up the whole
space so and move lil Pinocchio's cage
to our bedroom so Sarah doesn't have to
sleep with him oh no I'm sure she
wouldn't care but still anyway so that
is kind of our plan for right now he's
gonna go grocery shopping and I think go
to Costco we recently joined Costco
oh my gosh oh my gosh it's awesome
anyway so yeah
so I'm taking a little break look how
it's like mostly clean you can actually
see the floor I need to put those away
into the closet and shut the closet
those are going elsewhere but like I
just got some skin care to put in my
bathroom some papers to file and that's
about it so that's a good feeling but
I'm eating something I think it's
pronounced bobotie but it's my literally
my favorite food even above Pizza and
Tyler makes it it's well I've made it
before but he makes it better than I do
it's egg and ground beef and almond and
raisin it's a some I'm not sure what
country in Africa but we actually got
the recipe from a Disney cookbook that
was speaking of Disney
anyway we got the recipe from a Disney
cookbook
I think it was from boma the one of the
Animal Kingdom Lodge restaurants that we
love with their breakfast is amazing
it's like a buffet but I think this is
on I don't remember
just might be in the breakfast buffet
but I kind of feel like it was in the
lunch of it anyway so it's one of my
favorites it's like sweet and savory and
I love eggs it's not insanely healthy I
mean obviously there's ground beef and
stuff in it but it is so so good and I'm
currently reading some comments and
writing back hey
okie-dokie feel very like a springy and
what I'm wearing today but whatever I
figure if I throw a cardigan on over it
will work so my BFF should be here in
about an hour maybe a little less so I
just finished getting ready finally and
Tyler keeps texting me about what he
wants for Christmas he's at the store
right now I literally just got a text
that said I couldn't see what it was but
it said I want both of these for
Christmas feel like he's my kid
sometimes
anyway I'm gonna think of what I want
for Christmas I told him I just want him
to redo our closet I think that's a
bigger than Christmas kind of a gift I
don't know my birthday's in January
though so I kind of feel like it's both
it could be both hut other than puppy
sleeping in Sun patch he's so depressed
this invisible anyway um I've got so
many new products I'm trying right now
some of the things you might have seen
in my Ulta haul that I'm trying but also

wrong shade it's number three I think it
actually is correct so I'm gonna keep it
