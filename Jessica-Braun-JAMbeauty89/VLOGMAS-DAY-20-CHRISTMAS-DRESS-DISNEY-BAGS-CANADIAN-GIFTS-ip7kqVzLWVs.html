know this gonna do it any justice but I
like I feel like the past few days I've
been trying different kinds of
foundation probably why I'm breaking out
I don't know so like today I'm trying
the new maybelline superstay like the
new formula whatever I think it's a new
formula certainly new packaging with the
pump thank you thank you
um but I I don't know like I feel like
it's really bad like you can really
grossly see like dry skin here and here
and like even there I'm like and then I
tried out I know I'm starting off really
negative also good morning the new Urban
Decay all nighter concealer I did not
like the all-nighter Foundation but I
thought well everyone's like the whole
diner concealer is amazing you know like
oh well let me try uh-huh it's a very
dry formula which is awesome like it
sinks and really quickly like I was of
course using my L'Oreal sponge my
favorites and it was like and it was
like boom blended and I was like wow
that's pretty cool it was and I think it
had different coverage but I had to go
in with my finger and that's why it's
not as highly covered because it was so
dry dry dry dry dry dry no matter what
I'd put on on my under eye oh my gosh so
again I'm gonna be trying these out this
is literally truly first impressions and
you know how I feel about those I will
share them with you but you know it's
gotta have a follow up here in like a
month after it's really trying it
because it's just my skin is just so
extra dry right now so with that in mind
I think if you had oily skin you
probably loved both like if you have
oily under eyes this stuff is probably
the driest concealer I've ever used for
something that starts as a cream it's
very bizarre but even the super stay
full coverage I think it did have pretty
darn good coverage and I only put one
layer on if I went him at the second
layer like especially on my nose it
would definitely be full coverage but it
was just so dry I'm like abort mission
don't put any more on your face so I
almost feel like I need to put a lot of
glowy like powder and stuff on my face
see I don't want to put more powder
going around in circles but just some
interesting a thought
I will say I do really like this benefit
hoola hoola kwikki contour stick I
didn't think I'd like it I really didn't
but I saw some youtuber talking about it
I think it was like a declutter I was
watching and they were like it's just so
quick to just coach and then grab your
blender and just blend it in and so
that's what I did I even did a little
bit's up here and it blends in so
quickly but I do think you can still see
it enough
I don't like super super bronzed skin
but for me if you're fair like me
because I'm pretty sure yeah there's
only one shade but if you're anywhere
near me you could be a little bit deeper
this will totally work and it is really
quick so we're traveling here in like
nine days um to Disney and on a Disney
cruise I'm so excited I think that's the
bronze I'm gonna bring just because it's
so it doesn't take up much room
and it's just so quick and I will always
have a sponge with me so anyway I'll
shut up okay so I just put on for blush
since my skin is so dry the glossy a
cloud paint and dusk and the thing is
like when you first squirt it out it's
like whoa so what I do is I spread it
out on my hand and then I grab this and
I get a really thin amount tap a lot of
it off and then just lightly you know
tap it into my cheek areas that is the
only way I have found I could
successfully apply something a liquid
blush because I've always just avoided
them because I'm like no it always looks
crazy it never looks right but I feel
like this really is like a color that I
think I might have gone a little too
high that's the problem with using like
a giant blender but I just feel like it
doesn't look dry of course my breakouts
I'm just a mess you guys I feel very
conflicted because I'm trying so many
new products probably what's breaking me
out but I can't stop Jessica you got to
get your priorities straight girl anyway
um I really like this and I go back and
forth with products like this because
it's like it is it more work and I every
time I look I'm like I don't have time
but I'm like it really doesn't take that
much more time I just have to do it does
that make sense I don't know anyway
that's all okay so
got this awesomely cheesy Christmas
dress at Meijer I think it is awesome it
was like I might have been 20 I think I
thought it was 15 so I'm like oh I'm
totally by it but it's actually really
comfortable in today's like ugly
Christmas sweater day at our school
because we have like our staff holiday
party after and I don't know like I had
a sweater but it's not really that ugly
and so I was looking at the ugly
sweaters and I found this and I'm like
it's kind of ugly also cute also I just
want it because I would wear this on
actual Christmas too so I figure I'd
rather spend money on something that's
ugly
punky so I can wear it other times you
know what I mean I know that's like not
as fun I know I'm being like a party
pooper but I really like this it's so
cute it's comfy too also a little
low-key shout out to my ornament
earrings I want to say one of you guys
sent these to me a while ago and I wear
them all the time near Christmas and I
also have I know a different subscribers
sent me these a few years ago and I wear
these all I think every single time the
day before winter break I always wear
these they're Minnie Mouse like baking
at Christmas it's so cute so I always
wear those the Friday before break - so
those are coming up but I feel like I
need as a teacher I should have like a
collection of cheesy awesome holiday
earrings just because I think my
students are like oh my gosh she's
serious what a weirdo and I'm like I'm
in on the joke but you don't need to
know that I don't know I don't even
think they even noticed oh hello there's
the waggly tail I just got home and he
was laying on that couch he'd knocked
the pillows all around and he was not
getting up to wheatley so I just cozy
mm-hmm
all right so I just got back a little
while ago from our since the office
Christmas party out in the office our
school like Christmas party after school
and we did a white elephant it was fun
I'm so - hey and at one point okay
stop me if you do the same thing so
we're there and I'd ordered a sprite and
so they brought the sprite over and
there's like a whole table of food
because it's not like this restaurant
they run out like this part of it so
there's this whole table of food so I've
gotten some food and they brought me my
sprite and so I'm drinking it I love
sprite like I don't get it all the time
like I try to drink like more water but
I sprite is my favorite so I'm all like
it's bright drink it and I drink like
maybe half of it and 3045 minutes passes
and he comes around and he's refilling
stuff so you know I'm watching the white
elephant going on over here and he fills
it and I'm like oh cool fresh sprite so
I'm like wait a minute and then I'm like
watching him as he's going around I'm
like oh my gosh that is a pitcher of
water and he just felt my sprite with
half water so then I'm grappling in my
head like do I say anything like well
I'm gonna be here like another hour and
I definitely want more sprite but if
it's full and I'm like hey can I have a
sprite like or another sprite he's gonna
be like it's already full
and so I'm grappling with this in my
head and finally when he comes around I
end up saying way too much information
telling him what he did wrong like
trying to sound nice but you can't
really say that in a nice way I'm like
hey um can I get another sprite that's
all I needed to say but then I over
explained it I'm like um I had order two
sprite and you brought it and I drank
half of it and you refilled it with
water accidentally and you know it's no
big deal like way too much information
and then he feels embarrassed I'm like
Jessica you didn't need to say all that
and then I'm like no it's not a big deal
so I'm like I'm making this worse and
worse and worse so finally he brought it
back and it was all fine but does anyone
else do that like you you
overcomplicated in your head and then
you end up way over explaining something
anyway so I'm really in that debating
period I'm like you I take like a power
nap or do I push through and like do
some editing Tyler's doing some
Christmas shopping right now oh I did
want to show you something I got in the
mail oh my gosh if you here chewing
Pinocchio's got a bow he's very excited
about um so I got this in the mail from
let me grab her card so I say it exactly
right Amy's small world and I can put
her website link below she'd actually
contacted Tyler and then eventually got
through to me like he forwarded anyway
um and so she sells these real
cute bags with Disney prints at the top
so this is like a set and I know she
said this pattern is like one of her
best-selling that I loved this pattern
so much so this size is kind of like TC
a friendly TC ATS a friendly but then
there's like this smaller one and then
like this one and then this really large
one and then it also has this cute
little like wallet sized one like that's
so sweet and it's totally totally
homemade which i think is so cool and
isn't this pattern just amazing Tyler
wanted this one good that's so fun
because again that's like the TSA size
so he figured he can use it especially
on a trip to Disney so if I do film any
vlogs and Disney they're gonna be on
Tyler's channel so definitely subscribe
and by if I mean we always vlog in
Disney we usually do like each day
separate so there's a lot of logs that
come up but um usually in those vlogs
we'll talk about what we packed and
sometimes I like show what I packed and
things like that so definitely subscribe
to him his link is always like the first
link in my description box that way you

said something's really foul and I was
like sorry no I think I think is there a
trashcan I think don't show it and
people are gonna be able to smell it Oh
smell-o-vision I don't know if I might
happen Tyler so I made chicken last
night two nights ago it might say and I
threw the chicken in there I have my old
chicken yeah
might be that that's really it yes might
be that might be oh okay so we got a
sweet package from Jen who is is a
subscriber but she's kind of become like
my friend like on snapchat we like I
don't know if there's something about
her and like the way she'll describe
things like in videos to me on snapchat
that I'm like I feel like if I knew her
in real life we would genuinely be
friends like I don't know something
about her so um so we've kind of talked
back and forth on there and she lives in
Canada so she sent me some goodies she
sent Tyler's and goodies and there's a
