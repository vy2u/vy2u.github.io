out I have this on my skin that's what's
kind of like glassy this Physicians
Formula rose a all day oil-free serum it
says it brightens and tightens it's kind
of like a white pearlescent serum it
feels more like a moisturizer it's
thicker than like a normal like oily
kind of serum but it says it's oil-free
pearl luminous helps tighten in brighten
skin for a radiant glow enriched with
rose water to help soothe calm and
hydrate skin formulated with antioxidant
rich goji and kakadu plum there's no way
I said that right the richest vitamin C
source of any fruit so it says it can be
used alone and under or over makeup it's
kind of highlight e if that makes sense
but not enough that like I feel like if
I put it on my like foundation on top of
it that it would kind of move it around
and not I mean I can try it sometime but
I typically don't love products like
this for that they're just a little bit
too creamy I don't know I say that and I
do use some anyway but I typically you
can mix it in with your foundation I
don't know that it said that but you
totally could I mean products like this
usually work really well but I have it
under so I'm going to use that as my
primer today and just see how it looks
hmm I love this foundation
it's my Rimmel lasting finish I love it
so freakin much no no you don't get
enough love little buddy you don't now
their shade range I know is horrendous
like it's not great that sucks
and there are a lot of brands that need
to work on that but the form of this
there's definitely a smell I like the
smell it's kind of like I always
describe like everything like this like
clean laundry but it is but I love this
and this is the one my subscriber slash
friend Jen sent from Canada with the
freaking pump I wear the shade 100 ivory
I literally this is one coat and
obviously I need to conceal the obvious
things but like I just feel like
generally the finish is always so nice
so so nice so I think it looks really
nice over this stuff
like I feel like you can still see it
underneath it and it looks really
healthy because this is a nice coverage
foundation it does last all day I could
sing its praises all day long I'll link
these below I think this you unless you
can find and store the I think the only
place you can get it online right now is
physicians for Mia's website if I can
try to find it somewhere else I will I
mean I'll try duh
okay so today I just went with like a
kind of brown look can you tell so I'm
using the para sauna or persona palette
identity palette and let me show you if
I can open it what shades I used so I
used okay I hold on I just put the
camera around okay so I use charming all
over the lid this is really the main
color
Charming's all over the lid and the
crease and then I put goddess on top of
it and then I use sassy on the brow bone
and that's it Oh
Charming's also on the lower lash line I
think I used no I did use humble all
over to kind of set the primer before I
went in with charming but really it's
just charming in goddess I just really
like it I feel like this is a look
though it's so simple that I could
easily find like a covergirl trio or a
Maybelline quad wear it has a brown like
that and it kind of shimmery Brown that
you put on top and that's the look you
know what I'm saying so it's like you
need this palette for that but I am
enjoying this palette I'm curious to try
it some more and try different looks
like especially with this purple here
and with this kind of greenish shimmer I
don't really like it I'm very happy with
this completed look I like how simple
the eyeshadow look is I think it looks I
mean not to toot my own horn because
please I'm not a makeup artist and I say
that all the time but I feel like it's
so simple but it looks like maybe it
took longer than it really did and also
I've really been into like a shimmery
brow bone remember when people were like
crazy about that and then it kind of
went out of style I I do like it and I I
don't know if it's coming back or not to
be honest I mean I don't think it really
ever went away but like usually I just
do like a matte color but everyone smile
I'll just do a shimmer and I just think
it's so becoming this is too strong of a
blush but seeing different lighting
I don't know the blush I'm using I
forgot I own and that makes my heart sad
it's this ambient lighting one from
hourglass and it's in euphoric fusion
and it's a very it has glitter in it so
I'm like but it really the glitter
didn't show up but it's this really
pretty like berry I had to use like a
duo fiber brush this is the Sigma F 15
you can use any duo fiber brush because
it really is strong and even that I
tapped off and wiped off and it still is
kind of strong so then I was like toning
it down with my blender you know helped
a little bit but it's just such a strong
color which is why a lot of times I
reach for my really true favorite the
mood exposure which is just easy to use
I mean if you're fair like me that's
what I mean shade wise if you're fair
like you can tell this I could swirl
tons of this on and it's always like
perfect so that's one of my favorite
favorite blushes I travel with this one
quite a lot but this one is so pretty -
I just have to be a little more careful
with it that's all but if you had a
deeper skin tone the euphoric fusion
would be gorgeous because it probably
wouldn't be quite as stark on your skin
like it is on fine weird or not I can't
I'm gonna wear it anyway I just got like
I think this I don't know where I got
all these I feel like everything is
always from Target but just cozy come
it's Thursday tomorrow is PJ day since
the last I have to wear like somewhat
real clothes before what you call it but
these socks I think I got these pink
socks from Target and I just love them
I'm just gonna wear him like this the
80s are back friends I know he was so
happy
well he ever wants to do his sniffing
things though he doesn't really care
about the actual walking portion
okay so Pinocchio saw one dog on this
walk and we passed the house like where
he's seen where he saw the dog and every
time we pass it he just cries whether
the dogs out or not he just as he walks
by like staring at the house sadly it's
so sad and so
mouse volley top puppy in the wild okay
we always do this thing when we're about
to give Pinocchio boom and he's like I
don't really want it like he wants it
but he wants like like flavored ones and
we anyway doesn't matter we always just
hide it and say no it's my bone and then
he follows us and we hide it and like
the easiest hiding spot and then he
suddenly wants it classic so I got a
couple things in the mail first of all I
finally got those shirts from Etsy for
our Disney trip so this is the shining
shimmering splendid one I looked on this
person's Etsy page I don't think this
one's still for sale I'll link these are
all linked her page below but I love
this one from feeding the beast
I want adventuring the great white so
much slowly slip into it and then the
race on Ashman and making in the Disney
composers from like my childhood so I'm
so excited those came in all righty so
I'm gonna wash my face because I'm going
to take a bubble bath and I'd like to do
some kind of a sheet mask or something
so I think I'm I don't know if I've
recently mentioned I'm still finishing
up this equation gentleman rising
cleanser it reminds me a lot of my
favorite serum a hydrating cleanser
which is my true favorite I think this
is okay but I like the serum a better so
when this is done I've already purchased
the serum a stuff to use again it's just
my favorite and then right now I'm using
the origins original skin cleansing
makeup removing jelly yellow jelly not
jello with willow-herb this is fragrance
free which I like I love this is a clear
like gel that you use on a dry face to
get all your makeup off and then you
rinse it with warm water and then you go
in with a cleanser or at least that's
the way I use it and so it's my favorite
way to remove makeup I don't really like
using makeup wipes or my solar water or
micellar water I like but I just prefer
this I don't have to use any extra
things I can just use my hand
but I like that this is fragrance free
my the ones I've been using worthy it
cosmetics bye bye makeup which I do
really like but it does have a slight
fragrance and I always wonder like is
that you were taking my skin you know do
I really need the fragrance in that and
then I really like the Clinique take the
day off
cleansing balm that stuff I don't think
has a fragrance either and I really do
like that so but I like this too I like
that it's in a squeezy thing because
it's just a little more sanitary than
like dipping your finger because the
other two come in like a pot but this is
a little bit more now cream 'is not the
right word but it's not quite as thick
it's a little thinner than the other
ones so I think it does do I have makeup
like running or is that just like my
veins anyway but I do I do like it what
else I've been you this is the gonna be
if I put it on tonight this is the
Sephora allergy sleeping mask I probably
should have put this in a bag but I've
had it like closed in this cabinet
because I'm sure it's totally messing
with the ingredients but this has lasted
like a long time and I think they're
supposed to be like one use and Tyler
used it I used it then I use it again
yeah I might have to call it quits
though I don't know it smells okay
anywho all kinds of things I've been
trying the ordinary lactic acid so
really just to see how it compares to
the Sunday really good jeans because
those are both a lactic acid treatment
they both have a very strong smell but
the smells are very different from each
other which i think is interesting I've
had this a while though so I do wonder
twelve months I don't think I've had it
open for longer than twelve months I've
just bought it a long time ago I want to
say like a year ago so I don't know but
I've been trying that off and on I
haven't used it here in a few weeks
though so I'm kind of curious about that
but the smell of this is much more
pleasant the smell of this is very
pungent very very pungent I don't think
I like it but this is what I was talking
about yesterday that drying lotion I use
on breakouts as a last resort
was that you
today or jay-z I don't know I use this
just to really like dry up any breakouts
works pretty well what else anything
worth noting mm-hmm oh this is pretty
cool I don't know if I talked about this
this is this brand allies of skin this
promise keeper blemish facial you just
kind of put it on you leave it on even
Tyler's used it like on his forehead one
night when he was getting a little few
breakouts and it like cleared it up
overnight so do I think it works really
well for like deep under the skin once
no but when you're getting just a couple
near each other this knocks it out
perfectly and it also hydrates which i
think is pretty cool kind of goes on
like a moisturizer so just an
interesting I've been trying off and on
a bunch of allies of skin products
they'd sent me this a long long time ago
and I just now got around to trying it
and they're all pretty good so I was
just about to go start the bath and
Pinocchio so I'm just gonna weigh in a
big bed and I keep noticing every time
he lays down his treat ball is right
next to him like I feel like he's trying
to hit to me like fill it up mom I want
to kick it around and eat delicious
treats oh I know Oh pulpy you've been a
very good boy today by the way I got
things coming out all ones anyway um so
if you didn't notice or well Tyler's not
here he's actually staying with a friend
today and tonight and so I'm home alone
partying and what's funny though is I
feel like I get so and I wonder if
anyone else is the same way I'm like I'm
like I missed I genuinely miss him when
he's gone but like I feel like I can't
be productive like I get so sidetracked
whereas when he's here I can be super
productive but when he's not here I'm
like mmm mm-hmm
like I've got all the time in the world
to do things I can totally focus if I
want cuz no one's here to interrupt me
and yet I absolutely am NOT that
productive well I got two videos at it I
guess that's pretty productive and I
took a nap the NAP queen
but still so I am excited to kind of do
a little self-care and just take a bath
and relax and put on a sheet mask which
I do love to do and watch youtube videos
I really need to paint my toenails but I
don't think that's gonna happen tonight
I don't think I really feel like doing
it something to be honest ok now I've
really got to wake up wash off my makeup
come on Jess
alright it's bedtime I have oops I have
a little companion he said mommy I'll
keep you company tonight so off to bed
but we don't see you in tomorrow's vlog
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
