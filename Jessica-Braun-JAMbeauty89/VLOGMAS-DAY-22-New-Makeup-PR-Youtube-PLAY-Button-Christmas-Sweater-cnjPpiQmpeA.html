Freddy
so I used that persona palette again
okay I might be obsessed with this and
I'm thinking about as I'm thinking
towards packing for our trip coming up
here in less than a week or just about a
week I'm thinking about bringing this as
my only palette so I used the this shade
right here in this corner this bottom
corner called seductive all over the lid
it's so pretty and I just kind of blend
it up I just feel like so many of these
shades can literally be worn on their
own completely and they do a complete
look now I do have the shade Charming
which is like a matte Brown kind of in
the crease but it kind of got covered by
that shimmer and I don't even mind I I
just again I'm getting more into the
cooler tones but there's still warm
tones okay I'll shut up and I just
learned that you guys were telling me
that this brand persona is made by Sona
Gasparian who I just subscribed to when
you guys were telling him like ooh so
she's another youtuber and this is um I
guess her brand and her line and that's
so exciting I didn't even realize I was
supporting a youtuber but now it's even
more exciting and the fact that it's
really really good is really exciting
and I love its small packaging but it's
still cute that's a big deal to me I'm
kind of realizing because you don't need
a giant package I'm not gonna go through
this POW well who knows I do like it but
it's exactly the right size anyway I'll
shut up about it I also tried on my
breakouts this this is new to me this
cargo one base concealer and foundation
in one and I remember reading about
online and the reason I bought it was a
I was just curious about cargo since
we've been talking about it recently and
it was basically saying you know most
people don't need foundation all over
their face like a mask of it so the idea
of this is that you can just put it in
targeted areas kind of like a concealer
but it is more liquidy like a foundation
it's got it it's a doe foot applicator
though and so I just kind of put it on
the breakouts just to see how does it
cover it doesn't cover very well but I
would be curious on another day just to
try it maybe just you know some dots on
my cheeks and blend it in just to see
how does it cover because really that's
the main area that in my nose that I
feel
I want a little bit more evened out my
forehead usually is okay so I am curious
to try it that way with nothing else and
just see how does it look throughout the
day so let me know if you'd be
interested in that I also let me turn
the camera around I also got this line
from Ilya from a PR company it's really
expensive
I hadn't heard of it and so I looked it
up and I'm like geez like there was a
brush set and it's like a hundred and
seventy eight dollars a month what and
that was like it so that seemed crazy to
me but I was kind of swatching and
playing with a lot of it is nice so I
looked up the about the brand and
basically this woman started it and she
was talking about how like when she was
younger her brother had allergies to
things and so it was really hard for her
mom to find things she could put on his
skin and stuff like that that that he
wouldn't react to more natural
ingredients things like that well this
whole line is completely like NAT
apparently it's way more natural I can't
say completely because I don't know that
but it's a lot more of a natural line
but she was saying you know so many
people say that Oh for it to be more
natural than the quality would have to
be lacking but you know that's kind of
the deal you make if you want to put
better things on your skin and she was
just saying you know I want to break
that stereotype I want it to be that you
know why can't you have really high
quality and really good for your skin so
I've got some of their foundations I'm
gonna be trying out some eyeshadow quads
let me show you this one oh oh I thought
I broke it
look at those shades those are so up my
alley so I'm excited i swatched and they
feel dry but they swatch really nicely
we'll see how they actually go on and
blend but they do feel they don't feel
like creamy it's weird up some shadow
sticks liners some like highlighter
sticks lipsticks lip balms so there's a
loose powder I want to try so I'll let
you know let me know if you'd be curious
about like after I've tried this for a
few weeks would you want a line review
it is kind of pricey but you know if
they are really good and actually semi
good for the skin it might be worth the
price you know what I mean so just let
me know below okay it's pajama day I
opted for yoga pants cuz I really don't
feel like I feel awkward walking around
and like
lose pajama of hands does anyone like I
mean not around the house but like in
public and we're having our winter
parties so parents will be into I don't
know like I feel awkward and loose
pajama pants in a public place that's
just me I've worn it before and I feel
awkward on anyway so I'm gonna bring my
slippers with me but then look at this
Mickey and Minnie like I don't know oh
they're ice skating so cute I'm sure I
got this on clearance like it Target or
somewhere like that you know what I mean
I didn't buy it in Disney it would have
been freaking $50 if I bought it there
anyway so I'm gonna take this blue could
just he said please take me outside
feed him some breakfast take him outside
and then I've gotta hit the road my
hair's air drying today clearly Thanks
wait I had to put my little baking minis
on that I was talking about the other
day
I love these anyway
now my look is complete it was a long
day but I'm officially on winter break
Minnie you're facing the wrong way and
it is so nice to be on fall break
Heather
I thought his drinking water no he's
doing a waddle Tyler's on his way home
from Cincinnati where he was visiting
his friend and I'm so excited and he's
bringing home my favorite thing in the
whole world
okay that was a bold statement kolache
x' which not to be confused with i think
the other thing that's pronounced
collage keys which actually i think we
had recently anyway it's Kol ACH II from
the kolache Factory and it's basically
like a hot yeast roll filled with
whatever and so my favorites are the
breakfast collages and they're filled
with like you know eggs and cheese or
egg and bacon I don't even remember if
they do anyway it's been like two years
since I've had any and I'm like Tyler
when you go just by like 12 will freeze
whatever we don't heat theirs so good so
he's bringing some with him and I'm so
excited there's not really any reason
why we haven't had them because they're
actually not far at all from where we
live we just haven't I don't know I
think I just forgot about the
but they're so good I got some lovely
gifts and stuff from my students and
their families which was so so sweet I'm
always so thankful this time of year
they're just so like unbelievably
generous and I always try to get all my
like thank-you cards out before the kids
even go home today but with our little
winter party we had and all kinds of
stuff there is no time to get the rest
of them done so I'll have to do that
over break but um yeah just exciting
stuff oh look how cute this gift is
wrapped literally marble packaging in a
rose gold glitter bow I can't handle it
it's so cute
AHA I knew I'd catch you and you're just
petting him and he's volitans he's so
glad to have you home I'm glad to have
you home too we just had dinner
Pinocchio is ready to play I am ready to
play down to ground so I don't know if
I've ever shown or talked about this so
I hit a hundred thousand subscribers
quite a while ago and it was so exciting
and I was so excited to receive the
silver play button that they send out to
anyone that hits a hundred thousand
subscribers so I'm waiting and waiting
you know so excited for it to come in
the mail never got it months and months
and months than a year passes and so
finally I want to say two years later I
contacted like YouTube through like chat
or whatever you know YouTube helped chat
whatever and they were like oh well you
never received it because you changed
your channel name I'm like I did oh I
guess I did and I realized that my
original name of course was GM Vita 89
and a couple years ago I changed it to
my name Jessica Braun jabya 89 and
apparently when you change your name on
youtube it I don't remember how she
explained it basically they don't have
any proof that it's still you doing it
like running the channel so they won't
basically give you this and my little
verification checkmark next to my name
on YouTube had gone away too and she
said that's why both of those things
happen so she basically grandfathered me
in and said you know it's no big deal I
mean we can send it to you we know it's
you I'm like okay like whatever but I'm
just so excited to get it and I I have
it right here just above my computer
between my windows but I love it I'm
very very proud of it Pinocchio's upset
because Tyler took his tongue on whose I
am never gonna do I'm sure anyone
watching with the dog their dog is
probably what the Hoos did you watch
he'll call back
yes don't give me away
he loves the collar like you think you'd
be relief but he's like no thank you I
want it on forever times that's mine
Turner's got this fake fireplace but
it's like a heater oh my gosh it warms
this room up like crazy which is great
because like during the day when I'm up
here working I can just like leave the
rest of the house like cooler and then
close my door and keep it warm up here
in this little room I don't there's
actually more energy-efficient but in my
head it is yes is it so good have you
told activity tracker before yes almost
like someone asked I don't know what
they thought it was yeah it's just a GPS
trail yeah it looks like it like a bark
collar it looks like a obviously but
it's handed a GPS tracker because when
we very first got our fence he got out
and was missing for like two hours like
we got on Amazon like that next day we
always do I cried like a baby don't like
I don't like when you all missing that
was not okay and of course he was like
he was just sniffing around when I read
this one around yeah he was
not lost people kept seeing them and
they would call us to be posted online
like who we lost our dog next oh people
kept saying like oh is there an aardvark
in our backyard oh oh he's ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
