woke up with like a crick in my neck
have you guys ever done that I don't I
don't think it's called a creek that's
like what my parents called it so I grew
up saying that but like just like this
stiff where it's almost like partially
down you're like the area of your spine
and so when you like turn your neck a
certain way it hurts so bad so I was
looking up stretches and I was doing all
these different stretches this morning
it did feel good a lot hurt but if you
know what I mean
anyway so that's fun today that's the
news
but I'm making some coffee Sarah is
gonna be up here soon she might not be
up I'm out here with Pinocchio there

but it feels can you see my brother no

in real life anyway so I she's got to
leave in a few hours we're gonna have
some breakfast and coffee and stuff and
then today I need to edit yesterday's
vlogmas and get it up although by the
time this is up that one's definitely
already up and I'd like to edit another
just video that I fell in like a makeup
video and get that one up maybe later
today or set it to go live maybe
tomorrow morning I don't know and
Pinocchio is so cute I think he really
was sad that Simba was gone

vlogmas videos which of course i will
link below but i'm gonna go in and make
some coffee because it actually is kind
of cold my guys sara was like we got to
eat that out so we did and oh my gosh

newspaper well he reads the newspaper I
flipped through I read some parts and
entertainment no and then um you fill me
in as you read through listen to this

look at the ads and cut coupons because
we try to use coupons as much as we can
yeah anyway

soups things are bad and they're getting
worse oh we can show this tree we saw
haven't shown it as the Sun shines let
me have like any glasses I know it's so
night well I'm gonna edit some videos
and stuff so here's our harlotry we call
it like our nice tree and it was
actually the one we had at our apartment
it's a fake one of course um my parents
gave us that tree skirt and so we just
bought some garland and like a pack of
ornaments that are like silver gold and
white at Target and some twinkling
lights I think that's really all we have
on it but we thought it looked nice so
we kind of put some silver and gold
decor and white everywhere this was
Tyler's idea and I really liked it this
we found it Bath and Body Works it's
just like a rounded little thing and
it's so pretty and I'm sure we bought
this at Bath and Body Works at some
point too well we've got a little tart
warmer over here where you put the wax
or the tart in there and you turn it on
here I'll turn it on so you can see it
this I got like on clearance after
Christmas last year isn't that cute
so yeah just kind of simple room most of
this room was done with Ikea like I
think those pillows are Target the couch
and these two chairs are from Ikea yeah
I got this on HauteLook
I will link it below you get like crazy
deals on things I'm not just Christmas I
mean I get like cheap makeup on there
like so you got that we got this record

it's all like flash sales like they'll
be on there for a few days for certain
brands and it's like makeup home goods
clothing everything cuz it's connected
to Norwich like this was originally like
200 215 we got it for like 70 or
something I don't yeah making up numbers

this is our only Christmas one though we
need to get another Christmas one
yes that is so awesome
my favorite record is it down here that
eateth to us one Elliot's back there
he bought me that for my birthday one
year so I was so excited by record
player what was the video you showed me
the other day that was so funny like
back in numa numa
like Ebaum's world those kind of excited
first yes a viral videos I can't believe
I've never seen it yeah dang fries are
done you got to see it if I can remember
King and link it below paper you want
surprised with that to be a pun
surprised at that I'm sure I'm
butchering it but yeah so this is this
room hopefully cuz you see did you see
how far it was leaning if you look
please windows over there sometimes
maybe don't know holster yeah it will
absolutely anywho so I'm gonna go do
some editing and I need a shower I don't
know what I'm gonna do there's the first
Sunday we've had in years that I don't
like I don't know what to do with myself
today well oh yeah cuz you've edited so
many vlogs go read a book
go to where a little library in our
basement we'll have to show you guys
that sometime I don't know I don't know
what look at this boy he's upstairs done
he found the ultimate son patcher
a direct stream of sun open oh you look
valley fat said thank you got my winter
coat on hey some smoothies for us in
plastic cups because our dishwasher is
currently broken anyway um but it's got
some spinach that was about to go bad
banana vanilla yogurt what else
almond milk I think we put some protein
powder in it because like Tyler really
likes that
I don't mind having in mind remember Oh
strawberries I think maybe might even
put pineapple in them but it's a nice
way to like use up the spinach and you'd
be surprised how little you taste the
spinach in it when you have all the
fruit and yogurt and stuff in it too and
I just kept feeling like snacky and I'm
like I feel like I just need something
to be like filling today and good for me
that way I'm not continually snacking
when I'm at home you made us serve to be
honest I'm not totally sure you were
trying to use that cottage cheese so it
was weird we bought cottage cheese we
both love cottage cheese and we admire
which is a grocery store around here
have like the best cottage cheese and
then they like change their recipe and
now it's all weird and gross
do you want to upset about it clearance
it's really sad yes anyway we don't want
to throw it away because it's just a
waste and so I was looking at breasts
appease to use kind of cheese and then
one of them I found was like sweet buns
and so I made sweet buns but the first
ones you can actually see over there
matter but they're rounded we've got
this little you know Mickey head they
might cook kind of odd because the ears
are smaller whatever I'm like yeah I'm
excited and we are watching It's a
Wonderful Life nope oh my gosh I
littered with me and we're watching
Barney like that's all wrong at once oh
where are we grandma Mexico no China so
this is like my routine when I'm
painting my nails I sit on the floor I
like put out one of my just like
washcloths I used specifically for like
makeup and things like that I usually
have tea because it's usually in the
evening and I watch YouTube videos I
literally watch
I've been watching coffee break with
Danny's blush declutter forever it's 50
minutes long it's so like I've been
watching it in installments and watching
other videos between I'm just laughing
because I talked about it in another
video recently and it just goes to show
that it's literally taking me days to
watch it I just love her so much
anyway I think she just like speaks my
language when it comes to like she's
super
and just funny and like she's she's
friendly and respectful enough but she
also knows that like she's not gonna
please everyone and so she'll just say
what she thinks and I just think that's
awesome she inspires me all the time so
I think I'm gonna do my toes in bikini
so teeny just because it makes me think
of snow and I was like I don't want to
do like a drab wintry color like I'm
just feeling something happy I haven't
really taken care of my nails very much
lately and I feel like if I'm gonna take
the time to do it I want to wear a color
that makes me happy so I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna go with this we'll see snow
toes we're watching the rock it's like
Holiday Spectacular ever it's called um
from what ten years ago that I was like
what is their 75th anniversary is that
on Netflix yeah it's pretty cute
very Christmasy and Tyler what you
making for dinner handsome Swedish yeah

Justin I don't like when chicken has
bones in it using just like normal
chicken like boneless chicken breast

yes die doesn't hang me out to dry but
we like it better this way oh oh or
Christmas mugs look at this cute one

upside down and backwards I'm ridiculous

rolls right but we're on HBO now right

say I just think it's funny that this is
like a quote-unquote nice French meal
and booked out because our dishwashers

been doing so many dishes and me I have
to true and so I'm like I'm just so
tired of watching dishes I know I can

terrible oh the Lizzie McGuire Movie

I'm being serious about the Lizzie
McGuire Movie and mr. deeds is so good
yes my fellow Americans I feel like I
have its comedy right that one is pretty
funny uh what was the theater not
serious one Royal Tenenbaums we talked
