Monday and I'm getting ready for work
it's like 6:30 yeah I need to move on
but my skin's been really dry lately so
I wanted to kind of tell you what I've
I've been trying like the past few days
well okay I've been trying to use facial
oils everyday before I get ready so like
right now if you saw my Ulta haul I'm
trying out this derma e radiant radiant
glow facial oil I've been using it the
past few days now and I really like it I
have it on and then I just picked this
up as well this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory
speed plump moisturizer and I really
liked that too and it wasn't crazy
expensive or anything like that
anyway so I also am trying like a no
foundation look I was inspired by oh my
gosh why can't I think of her name I
forget Oh Iman I love her I think she's
such a natural beauty and she's just so
chill and anyway and she was just doing
like a truly no foundation makeup
routine and she just looked so beautiful
and she was just talking about how like
you know we a lot of us have decent skin
myself included I do have decent skin
and I always get all myself like oh my
nose is red and oh I've got freckles and
all I've got fine lines well so what
because a lot of people have skin issues
way worse than mine anyway
the point that she was trying to make
was that we always cover our skin with
the whole mask of foundation when a lot
of us really don't need to and while I
don't I'm not saying that I'm never
gonna wear foundation obviously I'm
going to I love foundation I do but you
know I thought she's so right and in the
wintertime especially like it's very
difficult to find a foundation that's
gonna look flawless all day without
letting dry skin shine through so today
I just concealed with my Ulta full
coverage liquid concealer that's it I
did my under eye I did a little on my
nose it's still a little red so I might
throw a little powder foundation I kind
of spot concealed in other spots but I
don't feel like my skin looks like
terrible so I'm curious to see what it
looks like once I've done like my eyes
eyebrows and stuff and like so all I'll
check back in when I'm done and what
kind of look at my saying I'm just so
curious do you guys know what I'm saying
and watching the video I felt like so
free I was like dang she write like
it's I don't know so I'll link her video
as well because I watched it like three
times i anyway anyone else do that like
when you like a video you like watch it
more than once and you're like why am i
didn't like i don't aim it alright I'll
check back in in a sec okay makeup is
done I feel like you can't see little
bits of like imperfection but I don't
feel like it I don't know let me like do
it this way so you can really and I
don't feel like it looks that much
different than when I wear foundation
like obviously with foundation it's a
little bit more perfected but I don't
really like super full coverage anyway
so it's like then if I'm just doing like
light to medium courage foundation why
even do it at all
I can get SPF obviously from a primer
with SPF or just an actual SPF
moisturizer so it's not like I'm using
it for that reason and so hmm I did end
up taking my I'm so used to like
snapping this in the morning and I'm
used to like running out of time I can
talk as long as I want except for it's
651 and I need to get going um I did end
up taking the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer just cuz I feel like oh I lost
my lighting there we go
just because I feel like I needed a
little bit more coverage and really I
just don't ever use this there's nothing
wrong with it I don't think it's just I
never use it
so I did end up doing that kind of down
here in my my freckling areas hmm I
didn't end up using any powder
foundation so I'm gonna keep messing
with this technique and let you guys
know but let me know if you have any
tips for not wearing foundation I'm sure
some of you guys are watching and you're
like girl I don't wear foundation like
ever and then I'm I know I sound crazy
but those of us that do wear it all the
time
it is almost weird to like take a step
back and like not wear foundation I
don't know really weird and in case you
wanted to see the products I was talking
about up close I will link these below
but this was the oil I put on this was
the moisturizer and then these were like
the two concealers I really do love this
for under-eye it's so like natural and
forgiving it's not crazy high coverage
it's funny that it's this full coverage
I don't need two full coverage but it's
like the right amount of coverage I
really like it
ooo I didn't want to forget I did take a
loose powder to set my under eye so I
used the peach blur I just grabbed one I
do like this
again do I think you need to go spend
the money on this I think there are
drugstore products they're just as good
but I did use that to set my under eye
just because I figured it would start
moving around and that's an area that I
really do did want to conceal because I
do feel like it kind of makes me look a
lot more awake anyway so just so you
know this kind of region was concealed I
mean set with the powder that's right
man
what's in this movie today handsome it
is too early 7:08 yeah tropical fruit
yogurt almond milk green yeah banana
well you gotta have a banana I really do
feel like smoothies without bananas are
all wrong like oh no no no no it's all
wrong we try to make what's healthier
smoothies for a while that we're like
you know they don't know they were we
had a lot of other things like you know
like no I think we had a little bit of
fruit what is more like I don't know
just leafy greens and then we were like
we don't like that leafy greens an apple
and like almond milk like that was it
and it was it's better yeah that darn
dishwasher still broken wait no it's
fixed well no and yes
you're sure oh I need to show everyone
my new shirt I got a Nazi horse yeah
we'll do it a second mine's in the
washer sadiq go finds it will home like
sure sure well then just listen do you
wanna see a wet shirt okay wet and
wrinkly right
no don't I was worried about that too
it's like a baseball shirt with white
and red I have the worst luck because
it's got white and red in it so I wasn't
sure if I should wash it with the lights
or wash it with the Reds
oh alright looks pretty good oh that
shirt is awesome go pick that out gosh I
don't know
he must have great taste it's so classic
Toy Story Pizza Planet so um okay so the
dishwasher yeah so okay well it wasn't
working and so I was tinkering around
with it like it didn't work for a couple
days so I'm taking around with it I got
it to work and then it stopped working
again and I take it around with it and I
couldn't get it to work again so my
article let's call somebody so he called
somebody and came out and he ran twice
and it worked
of course that's Murphy's Law I was
thinking that we're taking care of
what's wrong with it cuz he's like I
don't know it seems like it's working
fine so it's a $65 diagnostic fee and
I'm like you were here for 10 minutes
you turn the dishwasher on and it worked
and then you left ah so we're like
praying that it actually completely worn
ass but like I said it worked i tinkered
with it and it worked and then it
stopped again so I'm hoping he's like
yeah well you know if it's intermittent
like that I might need a new dishwasher
I'm like gee thanks dude I appreciate
all your help today he did give good
advice though cuz I was there for the
latter end of it cuz I just got home
from work and he did say you know like
the less bells and whistles you get if
you do buy a new washer yeah just less
stuff to go right that's a good life
lesson in general because the the one
that was in this house obviously this
one here that she always just here when
you moved in and it's got a lot of bells
and whistles and fancy stuff but I'm
hoping we don't need to a moment it'll
just keep working right cuz that's just
an expense though I know same - ochio
he's been so late look lazy oh my gosh
like all day he was playing with you go
earlier right you played a little bit
but he like gives up easily I think he
is - honestly I feel like it takes him a
few days he loves being a giant blue
horses as big as he is he just runs
around with it my floppy ears you need
to air those bad boys out whoo
I love the idea of an Aries your stuff
it's so cute so I just edited vlogmas
day three and that is like going live
and I'm watching some Tofte video poops
I just watch it so this guy speaking of
watching youtube videos because even
though we make youtube videos I don't
really watch YouTube videos all the time
Jessica's always watching YouTube videos
but I don't really watch YouTube videos
more often but a while ago a couple
weeks ago a guy named Jack Kendall I
think is his name email me said hey our
Channel
the channel 2 is like I like your
channel so if the D s my newscast oh my
gosh seriously
yeah I'm fangirling I freakin watch that
oh I've never heard of it where's there
I'm awesome I know how videos are
unbelievable like that I'm like how do
you get that you're like oh and I'm like
that you know that info it's fun to
watch any just three videos a week and
they're all like Disney news and stuff
it's yeah we'll link it below that's so
funny I wish you would have told me that
earlier nobody's like yeah I like your
channel and I'm like no I'm watching his
Emily that's so cool I'm kind of
freaking out low-key a little bit
low-key a little bit where's he from
though trying to place it
um okay lazy boy so I think we're doing
here let me flip the camera around this
is the state of affairs I let my hair
air dry like almost every day I feel
like my hair's happy because of it but
like something like look how crazy that
looks it looks so weird I need to like
braid it and like call it a day but I
usually like when I'm at work like
working I'll just toss my hair up and
it's no big deal but then when I get
home like oh my head hurts like I take
it down it looks crazy
um but I think we're just kind of like
leftovers for dinner oh I promised I
would check in from this morning about
like not wearing foundation okay sorry I
feel like I mean again is my skin part
okay Jessica can you learn to hold the
camera without so like I feel like my
skin's not perfect obviously but I don't
think it looks like that different like
especially when I would like go to the
bathroom today at school and like check
my makeup like you just kind of always
naturally do I feel like I was like oh
like it doesn't look as dry and gross
like yeah there might be imperfections
shining through but it was just
interesting so I'm gonna keep kind of
messing with it and trying different
concealers and like I said I'm not gonna
stop wearing foundation please but I
think you know doing that sometimes it's
just it's kind of nice and like I don't
know I feel like I'm like beating a dead
horse with this but anywho I said that
phrase in class the other day and they
were like and I'm like oh my gosh you
guys don't know what that means like
sometimes you know you just say idioms
without really thinking about how crazy
they sound to someone that doesn't know
means they're beating a dead horse I'm
like oh how do I explain that anyway so
that's kind of the plan I just put up
vlogmas like i said day three and I'm
kind of thinking about starting dad at
this footage I'm trying to figure out a
schedule when I'm you know back to work
throughout the week I'm like I don't
know if long as there's a lot of work
it's not that hard to edit the videos
it's just that you know you have to do
it every single day so we'll see but I
do have a lot of beauty videos I need to
edit that I'm trying to get up kind of
intermittently just because I don't want
it to only be vlogmas I want it to still
be my normal videos because I know a lot
of people don't watch my blog amiss so
that is the update okay so this is not
the Disney shirt I'll have to show it to
you later because it's like I don't even
know I don't know where I put it I just
opened it today and I'm trying to find
it but this is a pinky and the brain
shirt and it cracked me up we got it at
Target like four I don't know under ten
dollars in the men's section I just went
ham and I bought like a bunch of shirts
that I love this one
so I'm met to get really specific and I
wonder if anyone knows what I mean but
literally I'm editing an elf haul right
now and one of the highlighters is
called blue lagoon and the second I
heard that I thought of in Peter Pan I'm
trying to think of the lyric it's like
um think of a wonderful thought that
song but it's at one point she's like a
picture of Blue Lagoon huh underneath
the magic moon that part and so hearing
Blue Lagoon I thought of that and then I
thought about writing the Peter Pan's
flight ride in Disney World and then I
just started thinking about Disneyworld
I'm like oh my gosh I'm spiraling like I
want to go back we have we are scheduled
to go like after Christmas I'm like
dying to go back I we are so obsessed
with Disney like if you've never been I
can't describe it anyway I love it Tyler
I'm literally talking about just listen
what does this make you think of let me
play back
now I don't miss out now so this one's
in the shade blue do what does that
remind you of the restaurant Disney oh
oh I didn't even think about that what
else could it be
still Disney okay no what is that lyric
in Peter Pan where she's like it's the
think oh maybe it's mermaid lagoon not
blue lagoon but you're right the
restaurant is Blue Lagoon
I didn't even think about that anyway I
was just talking about how like this
like obsession is real like I can't wait
to go back because look I have the worst
luck no we are now I'm about
your no we are not doing this away
no I can't I can't so I finally found
like something that I really like right
and so I got two packs at Target and
they were like had two pair at each so I
got home try it on the first box is like
this is perfect they were the exact same
thing it sounds like that's perfect and
so I open both boxes and I just watched
them for the first time already through
the box of excite Ryder one on I think
they say you haven't washed them no I
washed them and that's how they came out
yeah and some of their children's
mediums because okay in all fairness
this was worth showing oh my gosh look
normal medium these oh they had to have
been a child's meet him they were in the
men's section and it just said medium on
the back and you really just didn't like
see I won't remember they sent you like
the wrong like color anyway like
lemierre's at the store I picked him out
but look they say medium but it has to
interested have to be a child's medium I
swear
we can give him to my nephew's oh that's
funny
okay we're dying cuz we're eating dinner
watching the last five years which were
both like musical nerds like that was
how we met we look and but we've never
seen it even though we both love the
music to last year
you like play it on the piano all the
time one week we could sing that yeah
score back and forth yeah from records
backwards so we're finally watching the
movie version and and we're laughing
because because she is such a good
actress she is like we both really like
her hearing the lyrics sung by someone
different other than just the main thing
from the original Broadway cast yeah
Sherie Rene Scott um we're learning that
we like yours well no I know but it is
for a long time because now I mean now I
I can read the sheet music and I know
what it is well we haven't said what it
is the lyrics we that we thought were
certain lyrics what I'm learning what I
originally okay when I originally heard
the soundtrack there's a lyric that is
she says huh marvelous novelist you mm
marvelous novelist you you and I thought
the way that Sherie Rene Scott who was
the original woman I thought what she
was saying is marvelous snobbish jus and
I'm like that's kind of novelist
speaking to every knows it's novel you
see a novelist
say yeah that was one and then a few
minutes later she says was the other one
the savior of writing yeah and she
always throws the savior arrived and
she's being roken like facetious the
savior arrived at the savior of writing
anyway so oh yeah I've know where they
are for a long time yeah sure sure sure
when I first heard it I was like Tara
lyrics I'm never gonna be able to unhear
marvellous novels you okay so we were
debating on what to watch tonight in bed
and right now we've got Family Guy on
but we were thinking about switching to
since I'm in such a Disney mood
sometimes we'll go on YouTube and just
watch like they'll have like
two hours of classic Mickey cartoons so
we'll just like watch that because it
reminds us of our Disney Resort where
like when you're in the Disney resorts
they have like one channel that's just
available there at their hotels that's
well actually no yeah it has to just be
at the hotels anyway that's just like
Mickey cartoons that's it
oh like 24/7 and so we always watch it
as we fall asleep when we're there at
Disney World so anyway so sometimes we
do that and I'm trying to convince them
to let me do it anyway but we are going
to call it a night so I hope you enjoyed
the odd mistake for definitely check out
Thomas days one two and three don't
forget and a little don't forget to
subscribe to my channel but also Tyler's
channel I'm putting his link as the
first link there in the description box
and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
