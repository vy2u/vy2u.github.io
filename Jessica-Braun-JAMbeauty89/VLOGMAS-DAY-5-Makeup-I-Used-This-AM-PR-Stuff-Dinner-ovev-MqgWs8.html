mornings I'm extra tired so this is
something we did in Tyler's um no um in
Tyler's office which is where I am right
now we had this old curiae and I say old
it's not actually that old but it had
broke and so we contacted Keurig and
said hey like the it's not working it's
on it's under a year old because their
warranty they're like yeah we can
actually send you a brand new one okay
cool
Wow and so we had to like prove
something out novia de why is that clock
ringing it 5:45 anyway so they said yeah
just prove it so we proved it with some
serial code and then they sent us a new
one it took a while to get it we finally
got a new one this was like a year and a
half ago this was a long time ago so we
got our new one and then a few months
later this one started working again
we're like and so he was like well I
mean we didn't do anything wrong
like it wasn't working we kept
unplugging you know and we did
everything they've said so long story
short we now have to cure now this one
isn't perfect like the screen will get
messed up and we'll have to unplug and
replug it back in but we just we were
gonna sell it at a garage sale and
finally we just my dad actually
convinced us to keep it and just put it
in Tyler's office so it's actually kind
of nice cuz if our bedrooms right down
there it's nice that when I wake up I
can just come in here and I make myself
some coffee I bring a cup into Tyler he
kind of wakes himself up and lays in bed
for a little bit and reads the news and
drinks it and of course I come in here
and it gets ready I'm like especially
tired this is the state of affairs I am
genuinely like I'm so tired and we went
to bed at like 10 20 which honestly
usually we go to better I'm like 9
sometimes earlier but like going to bed
at 10:20 we gotta 537 hours of sleep is
not enough this gal needs 8 I'm so
spoiled I know
I know that when we have kids everything
will change right now I'm like a baby
about sleep anyway all right so I'm
gonna get ready this is my warning I'm
starting to slide this over and it just
fell over and it made the most
ridiculous noise and not only that but I
was in the bedroom giving Tyler his
coffee and I know we always let
Pinocchio get in the bed like the last
like hour of the morning does that make
sense and he was being super late like
he wants to be up there but he was being
lazy he was just like putting his paws
up like he wanted to be lifted onto the
bed and I'm like oh come on and so he's
just kept doing it and looking at me and
just so cute so I went fine so I lift
him up and he's a freaking beagle and
they're so loud and if you like touch
his armpit weird he goes wow like you're
freaking injuring him and so I knew that
about his armpits cuz I fall for it
every time I'm like cheese so I was more
like in the stomach he still did it even
for Tyler he's just like you know just
getting out of sleep and now the whole
neighborhood's awake this is a rough
start to my what is it Tuesday it's
gonna be all right Jess you're gonna
drink some coffee you're gonna drink
some water cuz I'm thirsty too you're
gonna get this face looking better Hey
the like crick in my neck feels so much
better finally thank you I was like
legitimately praying about that because
I'm like this is horrible like I'm doing
like little like conferences and small
groups in class I'm like yes like so one
thing I still use all the time I just
put on my skin is the NYX hide your
touch without not foundation primer and
it's funny because I feel like I watch a
lot of people and I'll hear them talk
about something and I always wonder like
in five months are you still gonna be
using that are you only using it right
now cuz it's new or it's just new to you
like you just recently bought it I don't
mean like I think about it like they're
doing it for the wrong reasons and
that's not what I mean at all
I just mean I think we all naturally
I'll try to get the slide back on I
think we all naturally wonder
like okay it's a favorite this month is
it gonna be a favor and a year you know
is it just the novelty of it or you know
what I'm saying so that's why I love
those videos that are like Holy Grail
favorites because or like like I just
filmed one I'm gonna have it later this
week called most repurchase makeup those
videos are awesome because you get to
see what are people genuinely using over
and over again that they really do love
time and time again this is not in there
cuz I've only had one but this is still
one I think I discovered it maybe I
don't know six months ago and I just
love it I mean obviously my skin right
now I don't know what happened in my
sleep but I feel like my skin looks
crazy my eyes are so red it's so weird I
mean once I put like contacts in my eyes
that always helps and you know but I was
gonna try the no foundation thing but I
don't think today's that day like you
guys saw my skin in vlogmas day 4 right
and I feel like this morning is just so
weird I'm trying to think of like what I
did in my skincare routine like did I do
anything different I really don't think
I did anyway so I don't know I'm gonna
see if I can get to the bottom of it but
I think I'm gonna put an actual
foundation on today cuz I just don't
think this is a good skin day for that
my skin already feels better so I pulled
out my it cosmetics CC cream that like I
always say it's not really like a BB or
CC cream it's it covers like a
foundation but it does have this like
almost glow to it and I had a lot of
like moisturizer on under it but I mixed
it with the Misha perfect cover BB cream
I have it in the shade number 23 I think
when I got it this was a while ago
they sent it to me and I I don't know if
they they must have just picked the
color I just assumed there was one color
because I know a lot of these more
Western BB creams like don't have very
many shades or only have one and I don't
know but it's kind of a gray tone but I
mixed it with this and it I think it's
really nice I still think it's just a
little bit too like deep for my skin
tone like I was blending down I was like
but um but why
for example the it cosmetics light the
second I go to the next one down which
is fair it's way too light so I've kind
of settled on light being my my the best
shade for me because their shade range
there it's not very big anyway but I
feel like it just it totally covers
imperfections but it just feels so good
on the skin I do need to set my under
eye the concealer I use today was the
pixie pad away concealing base I still
don't know how you feel about I mean I
think I like it I don't think it's like
a bad product but I mean pixie can be
kind of pricey so I'm like well is it
worth it
but now frickin drugstore prices are
like the same as pixie like there's so
many drugstore products that are like
ten to twenty dollars I'm like so now
like before when I used to consider
pixie I'd think oh it's kind of
mid-range because it's more expensive
than drugstore but it's not as much as
like stuff at Sephora no now drugstore
is like absolutely the same price so
it's like anyway cuz I want to say this
is between 15 and 20 dollars I will link
all of these products I'm mentioning
below anyway but I you can see it
doesn't perfectly cover cover dark
circles and stuff but it is nice it
definitely I don't know it's okay if
that makes sense
I think if you've got really youthful
skin you can pull it off just fine I
mean I feel like I can pull it off okay
now me in 10 years I don't know I mean
it definitely sinks into fine lines like
every concealer does but anyway so I'm
gonna set it and stuff but I just feel
like my skin is like thank you for
calming me down thank you I was getting
really upset and you really calm me down
Thank You Jess anyway I am in like the
weirdest mood do you ever get in mood
and it's like before work and I have to
say go I'm clearly chatty going into
work yesterday I was like I don't want
to go to work but like today I'm like
alright cool like I don't know anyone
else like good feel like I'm like I
think I'm just counting down to winter
break and it's funny because and I
wonder if anyone feels this way like
with work
I like I feel like the thought of going
to work on one like the weekends over
the sucks but then usually once I'm at
work
like I'm like okay I'm good you know
what I mean it's just the same like they
always say like going to the gym half
the battle is getting there once you're
there you're gonna work out and usually
you do a decent workout but it's just
that battle of getting there be like I
don't want to go to the gym today I
don't you know what I mean it's the same
like if you run outside or you workout
at home
once you're like in workout clothes and
like they're ready to workout and
whatever space you workout you're
probably gonna do it's anyway I am
babbling half this vlog is me just
talking I'm so sorry I promise we'll do
other stuff to this day today go check
out vlogs 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
anyway alright but I wanted to actually
show you these so this is the Misha
perfect cover BB cream it's such an
awesome beauty here again it has like
some decent coverage so it's not like a
BB cream you've maybe tried from like
the drugstore where it's like like a
glorified tinted moisturizer this really
does have coverage but like I said this
particular shade is quite gray toned
which kind of works for me and if you
like that kind of neutralizes things and
then of course this I talk about all the
time fantastic
high high SPF looks like a foundation
but my skin just loves it um and then
this is that pad away concealing base
alrighty so I feel like everything kind
of what's going on here but I do feel
like my skin looks a lot better I
already feel better so I'm gonna go dry
shampoo my hair a bit to actually get
changed and live through this day that
is Tuesday okay one last thing I just
threw on the I keep forgetting how good
these are the L'Oreal infallible paints
this is in spicy blush and I usually
just go tap tap tap tap and I usually
just throw it on over whatever lip balm
like I already have on I just feel like
it makes your lips feel like good you
know what I mean is it perfect no I
don't like in my opinions not meant to
be you could lip line your lips and make
it look me but like
me too just throw on for work I feel
like it's it's nice it's our favorite
afternoon ritual after work we like to
grab a bunch of cheese which he just
bought a bunch of new ones dude these
are all these have our tea dill holy
moly it's one of my favorites and then
Monge go and this is a new one we
nurtured balsamic benefit on oh and we
have like a crackers yeah yeah
I was trying to find at the store like a
box of assorted crackers and I swear it
couldn't find him anywhere these were
like four dollars unless one of you is
so expensive anyway so we always go with
rinsing like we need something a little
different yeah I know you can make
crackers but I've never tried to make
crackers but we like to talk about our
day and I've got crazy selling today
thank goodness it's like super healthy
as well well
Pinocchio this is AG washy lipstick what
did you do to this
pinoke why did you do that
we really can't leave like even a drawer
on the bottom a little bit a jar he's
pulling something out like he is such a
stinker
so I just got this package from origins
and I don't always show the PR but the
back is kind of cute but I literally
open the box now it's like oh my gosh it
smells amazing
and then I got really pumped because
there were products that I've been
wanting to try so like this is there
ginger souffle I've heard it's amazing
it's like a whipped cream like lotion
moisturizer for your body and some of
these I haven't heard of so like this is
their gloom away grapefruit body washing
bubble bath mmm
precipitation continuous moisture of
recovery for body I could use that on my
legs oh my gosh my legs are so dry um
and then smoothing souffle so I presume
these are kind of like the same souffle
line just different like I don't know
types and then I think the lesson thing
in here is like a candle
this is cute feel-good candle neroli and
lemongrass maybe this is what I was
smelling yeah yeah that smells amazing
very fresh not like super Christmasy but
just fresh so that's exciting let me
know if you'd want like reviews I don't
know but Tyler was just saying that he
feels he just smelled the candle I was
like smell it and I hit my tooth he was
saying that it smells like if you've
ridden the ride Sauron at Disneyworld
the smell when you go over like the
citrus grove that is like exactly what
this smells like that was amazing
oh my gosh like it really I want to
smell it again I know that there are a
lot of like Etsy shops that sell like
we've gotten one I want to say like who
bought it for us I don't know but it was
like what smells like what the Grand
Floridian smells like and they have like
wax melts and candles that smell like
all these different places in Disney
Pirates of the Caribbean we got a candle
once called the Black Pearl and it
really does smell like that right it's
so cool so as I'm sitting here I'm about
to go down and tag-team make dinner with
Tyler I just uploaded my elf haul an
vlogmas day for and someone commented
and it's so true talking about health
and how yes it's awesome it's affordable
but it's so frustrating because like you
know people that order from elf online
like for example I ordered all of this
stuff online you know they have their
whole collection on elf cosmetics calm
however when you go into like any store
that even sells a little bit of elf
it's never the whole line so like some
of the products that are in my haul I'm
like oh my gosh like I had no idea these
existed some of them are new some of
them are just like you know like in the
caverns of the online website but
they're never in store and so really
does stink because some of their coolest
products are ones that are so impossible
to find in any store so you'd have to
order it online and Ulta sells elf
cosmetics but again they don't sell
their whole line they only sell some
products so it's like you basically
you're basically forced to order from
elf cosmetics calm if you're wanting
those very specific products which I'm
it is what it is but a lot of times at
least Pinocchio wants out so bad he's
crying
hold on Pinocchio geez but it's just
kind of interesting at least elf has
sales we're like I never order unless
they have like a free shipping usually
it's like free shipping over $30 I'm
like well elf is inexpensive but when
I'm placing an order on their website
I'm probably spending over $30 because I
like to make it worth my while I would
say ordering from elfs website I
probably do it twice a year and I just
do a big order of course the reason I'm
doing it might be different than the
reason you're doing it I might be doing
it just because I'm you know wanting to
review a bunch of it and let you guys
know what's out there you're probably
doing it just to have the products and
use them so I don't know so take it with
a grain of salt but I like sharing
what's all out there but it does think
that a lot of it's not easily accessible
in person in store okay
so we're making a kind of quick meal
tonight so we're having some tortellini
from all these cuz it's like the perfect
like quick dinner I think there might be
like little bits of cheese in there I'm
not sure
and then we're heating up pesto just
leave us alone everyone always makes fun
of us are heating up pesto but we like
it warm I know you're not everyone means
one person comment one point Manson it's
never left you can't we're like what we
want to pesto out of the jar some wild
furnace you've made homemade pesto
though it makes it it's a whole
different ballgame so this was the thing
from all these pretty huh no I think I
don't know if this was from all these
maybe and then we're having some lima
beans and hey you said that was that
mama you wires like I didn't like and
then I made some like the Red Lobster
biscuits a few days ago and so we're
heating some more of those up it's a
decent we're gonna pick out a movie
we've been like honor-roll watching
movies we I feel like we eat like never
watch movies so we're trying to like I
don't know we're just watching movies
okay so we decided to finally rush to
watch The Royal Tenenbaums I learned we
were saying wrong and we're eating these
like their Christmas money bars
yeah they're nutty bars but they call
them
than they are yeah they're like thinner
than normal and they're individually
wrapped really layers instead of five
rather fine
we're apparently nutty bar connoisseurs
yeah I think it really is it's they
taste like normal though they don't
taste like white chocolate agree I mean
they're good we eat them very sparingly
but this we never buy it
yeah well yo nutty bars yeah I just mean
like generally little David Debbie's a
Tokyo that can't be comfortable he's so
happy to be on your lap but he's like oh
you look very sleepy full belly oh my
gosh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
