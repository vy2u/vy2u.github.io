moisturizer maybe ok let me tell you I
was like on a mission today you're gonna
laugh at me when I tell you how many
layers I put on I'm just experimenting
but this is too much
ok first thing I started with I did like
a hydrating essence I think it's like
the co de lis essence all in Colleen's
below it's in my bathroom I put that on
my face after my shower and then I put
on the elf Beauty shield vitamin C
pollution protection serum or prevention
serum I love this stuff I've got to be
almost out I put that on most days
anyway then I followed up with the
radiant glow face oil then the soap and
glory speed plump moisturizer those were
what I was showing you in the other
day's vlog but then I put some SPF on
just because well now I'm realizing I
was I didn't know what I was gonna put
on my face if I had realized I was gonna
do this CC cream again like I did
yesterday I wouldn't have worried about
it but I was putting on the philosophy
miracle-worker SPF 50 which I like so I
put that on and then I decided I was
gonna go mixing these BB creams route
like I did the other day and so here we
are
oh I forgot before I put on the BB
creams just for fun I put on the Becca
backlight priming filter it's a little
bit too much boy it is moisturizer but
I've got a like tone this down we'll see
we'll see so I'm currently using my
Stila soul palette so I'll show you my
look but I'm wearing this kind of bronzy
shade all over then this is kind of on
top of that I used this in the crease
that's on my brow bone and that's also
on my lower lash line oh and I threw a
little of this on top of my NYX Tracy
Lee liner that I'm trying out I felt
like it wasn't black enough so I threw a
little of that on so that's what's on my
eyes right now so it's not I haven't put
mascara on but I feel like by putting
that gold on top of the bronze that kind
of cancelled out a lot of the colors so
now it's just like kind of boring
but I need to put some mascara on but
I'm not gonna do gel liner and liquid
liner today I'm not feeling it I have
like a whole day of meetings somehow we
have one before school we have one like
the last few hours of the day where they
have to give me sub substitute teacher
coverage so anyway for a boring day I'm
gonna do a boring I look okay I am
obsessed with this Tarte highlighter I
did end up having hard pan I think
panned pan on it this is the Tarte
Amazonian clay highlighter and stunner
so I have it on my cheekbones and on
mine here's the deal I think I literally
got hard pan on it right away from
watching it once so I took a little
spoolie and scraped the entire top of it
and now like it's amazing I'm just gonna
swatch it on the very very side it's
watching so much better I love the way
it looks on the cheeks oh my gosh and it
smells sweet like oh my gosh I don't
know how to describe it it smells so
sweet I'm I love it I love it so much I
feel like no one really talks about this
or maybe I just haven't been listening
you know what I mean like if it was
something that wasn't on my radar I just
didn't notice people talking about it
but it's stunning I love it a lot of
people like the shade exposed the
exposed highlighter they have the
exposed blush as well which is really
popular but they have the highlighter
exposed that a lot of people talk about
but that was a little bit too dark for
my skin tone and when I first hauled
this I know a lot of you guys are saying
I bought exposed first and it was way
too dark and I realized stunner was
better for me all right Tyler made her
smoothies this morning
it's got like triple berry mix banana
vanilla yogurt almond milk some protein
powder Oh lots of greens see that's what
I'm saying like you can't tell when you
taste it I put a lot of handfuls in and
you really you can get those uh vitamins
and minerals from one without tasting
them whoo okay how sweet a student of
mine made a bunch of Christmas cookies
for me and mr. Roth although I shared
some of the
with we had a staff meeting and I shared
them with my table but oh that's so
sweet I love homemade stuff this is so
cute I might be buying this Pinocchio
looks just like Pluto I just think it's
so cute it's like 25 dollars and I still
might oh my gosh that's adorable
so I'm at CVS and I feel like they never
have like the new stuff Walgreens always
does but CVS never does cuz I feel like
I always walk through this and I'm like
nothing new
and then Walgreens has like every new at
least effort I'm tiny I don't fit
anywhere no just got home from school
came into the bathroom sat down there
he's gone five times you are why me why
are you so tired your day consists of
mass weight why sometimes because we
know I know that but most of us like
we're gonna go see a movie tonight yeah
you Coco is that part of it no no no
that's not okay
all I know is where we're going you can
eat like they say feed you like get
dinner
I just drool save that that's the time
flix Brewhouse and i have liked it
like it's like a dinner in a movie it's
awesome dinnerwire it's literally every
time success month ago like twice a week
every week we would because the tickets
the same prices like any normal movie
theater and then like the food I mean
it's not make donald's prices but it's
like a tweezer yeah I mean honestly it's
like going to appellee in really food
wise like taste wise it's like goin
Apple yeah but it's like like reclining
chair they also have its brew house and
so they have beer and they brew their
own beer together and they have wine
stuff too
yeah yeah it's just all and all-around a
fantastic experience we learn about what
six weeks ago and this is our third time
now for at the movies I love this place
so much all right evidence that I cried
during the movie Coco right there how
did you cry it was good it was so good
it was so so good and we knew it would
be good but it was even better and
emotional and the music was awesome oh
my gosh it was so good it was so good
everyone should go see it I'm surprised
I'm not hearing more about it but it
took him like what six or seven years to
make 2011 the longest it's ever taken
Disney Pixar to create a movie it was
beautiful but it was really good the
story itself was so good but the movie
itself was just beautiful to watch but
yeah so on a huge level like the just
the graphics in them the actual just the
movie itself was beautiful but
on the emotional level it gets you gets
you it's crying like a little baby yeah
so we're probably gonna end the vlog
here we're gonna go home and go to bed
I'm already tired I'm emotionally
drained now so that's okay I'm done
owning this character ain't no to happen
it's amazing
terrain yeah so we will catch you guys
