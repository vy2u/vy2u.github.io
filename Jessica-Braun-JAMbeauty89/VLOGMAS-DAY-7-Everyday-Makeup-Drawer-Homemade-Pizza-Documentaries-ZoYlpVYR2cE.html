done it every day makeup drawer and I
keep meaning to do one like I plan to do
in a November then November was gone and
I really don't know why because I love
doing these but I figure why don't I
just do it here in my vlogmas so you
guys can actually see it because the
odds are it's gonna change again in like
a week you know like I like to empty it
out and change it every few weeks really
so I'll kind of quickly go through it it
probably won't be as long as I could
normal everyday makeup trip so um a lot
of just new stuff I'm trying so like the
next rizzoli liners some favorites that
I love my voluminous lash paradise again
some more favorites the NYX epic liner
is my favorite liner there's a lot of
elf products I'm trying
over the next month the pro eyeshadow
primer I like the waterproof eye gel
eyeliner from ELF I'm I don't know I'm
kind of realizing I don't think it was
it's watched well but upon trying it I
don't know that it's very good but again
I'm continuing to try it
elf brow their volume plumping mascara
lip gloss and then this is the pop matte
from Clinique and number shade number
one I've used it once but my lips are
really dry to the time I used it and it
looked crazy so I need to make sure my
lips are exfoliated and not dry the day
that I want to wear that my pretty
vulgar brow pencils what I've been
wearing exclusively in my brows for like
two months I really like it
um so my favorite gel liner the old side
gel eyeliner this is that Tarte poreless
primer that Tati swears by I'm trying
out I want to use that today my brand
new repurchased it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination I have it in
fair it's a powder foundation I freaking
love this of it's the best stuff I've
ever found it's worth the price every
single time my Tarte highlighter I was
recently talking about in stunner this
is a models own kind of clean bronzer
I'm trying the fancy Beauty primer the
la mayor foundation this moisturizer
I've showed in some other bloggers says
the soap &amp;amp; Glory speed plumper
smells really good I've been liking so
far again the derma e radio face coil
the elf beauty shield serum this who
were this yesterday the revolution matte
blush Oh
Jessica in beloved it's really light if
I can try to swatch it one-handed is
always here but it's pretty if you've
got really deep skin no way I mean it's
gonna look really ashy on you and it
like I feel like it's kind of borderline
for me and I'm pretty fair so anyway the
seller blush I haven't actually tried
tried it's in the shade flare they
recently sent me about just uh a sense
he beauty highlighter duo in there their
kilowatt highlighter in lightning dust
and fire crystal this was about the only
woman I looked at it online that seemed
like it could be shades I'd actually
wear cuz obviously the other ones are
just meant for different skin tones so I
think if you're similar to mine I have
been wearing this subtle one waiting
more often I call it a subtle I mean
it's still a highlighter but like this
one over here has more of a shimmer
quality to it they're really pretty
honestly genuinely okay that was too
much redundant anyway but again
continuing to try the Tarte blush in
risque is really pretty and then I've
got my little elf best friend duo's I've
been trying T for two as my favorite
I've been wearing that alone and then
this is one of their trios in Rose a all
day and then back here I've just got the
Stila eyeshadow palette I was showing in
yesterday's vlog let me see if I can
open it in what is it called like soul
eyes are the window to the soul I really
really like it like a lot
and then my positions for me a little
shadow quad in classic nudes I'm
continuing to try I've got a stellar
primer and foundation I'm trying this is
my miscellany and it's like I'm trying
out the boola Henriksen truth serum that
people love lip balms my eye cream from
volition the Hilux am/pm IG l got some
more skincare my origins original skin
matte moisturizer my foundation brush
from Clinique this is
new to me it's from I don't know what
the CM stands for but they recently sent
it to me and it's a you can take this
off foundation like it vibrates you
probably can't hear that and you just
like rub it on your skin it actually
worked really well the first few times I
tried it so I want to try it again cuz
I'm like what like I did not expect that
to work and then like my little Sephora
color switched so that's really
everything in here it's time around like
I said some of these I've started to
really get a feel for so I'm kind of
ready to switch some things out you'll
notice I really don't ever put a lot of
lip products in these because when I'm
genuinely wearing a lip product it's
usually the weekend or after work
because the products I wear to work I
usually have like in my purse or I just
leave at work and so I just have
separate drawers crap but anyway yeah
alright how do I get it so that you guys
can see here we go I have half my face
done and half not with Foundation and
this is kind of what I mean like you can
see some red splotchiness on this side
you can still see a little bit and then
I guess like when I was talking about
like not wearing foundation Allah I know
it resonated with a lot of you guys
because it resonated with me because of
someone else talking about it but like
it doesn't make that much of a
difference and when you're putting like
a whole mask over your face depending on
your skin problems because obviously
some of us have skin problems that are
you do want to cover I mean I totally
get that and there are days that I do
like today even this redness and like I
want to cover that I've got like veins
you can see you know what I mean but I'm
using this stellar foundation I'm trying
it out of course it doesn't say the name
of it literally anywhere but it does
kind of even it out but I will say with
this foundation it's much more of like a
light to medium coverage clearly but it
does at least even it out and I don't
feel like it's quite as much of a mask
so like those foundations that are
really high coverage like even like the
Revlon Colorstay
that's one of my original favorites but
even when I put that on I don't even
think I own it currently just kind of by
happenstance like it had gotten old and
I just haven't
to sit but even once like that like it
really is more of a mask on your face
and even though you know I can make I
can look at it and it close up me and be
like wow this looks so flawless and nice
but I know that when I'm in other kinds
of lighting how it looks I know that it
looks dry in certain areas or it looks
just not as natural and I don't know so
I'm still playing with it and like I
said I'm never gonna stop wearing
foundation I do love it and there are
times in my life that I do want that
kind of a coverage but I'm just trying
to be more aware of how it makes my face
look to other people not just to me and
not just people that love makeup but to
everyone else in the world because we
are a weird you and me we're a weird
subset of people that we just love
makeup and we can't explain it it just
is what it is but yeah it's my two cents
today I'll shout back in in a little bit
happy Thursday
okay a little sidebar so I've been okay
the NARS really expensive I say this cuz
I was upset that I spent some money soft
matte complete concealer a lot of people
like and I'm like what so I bought it
trying it hold on how am I going to open
this I'm trying to hold it okay chill
man that was the talent okay so it's a
really like dry I mean it kind of comes
off creamy did I say I'm in this shade
Chantilly I probably could have gone to
the next shade up which is what vanilla
anyway but I bought Chantilly I don't
know why and I've been using it just as
an eye primer like do you see how it
canceled out like tons of color I did it
yesterday and I was like that was good
like it worked really really well and
the thing about this is it's just a
little bit too dry for my under eye I
mean I don't know how else to describe
that it just is I feel like I'll get it
on I'm like okay and then I'll start to
blend it whether it's with a brush or my
finger it doesn't really blend with a
Beauty Blender because of its
consistency it's just not meant to be
blended I've tried it and I'm like oh no
anyway I just never really like the way
I feel like it accentuates my definitely
accentuates my final
anyway so I'm like well what am I gonna
do with this I can't you know I could
pass on to sister but I can't like pass
it on to you guys you know it's
definitely been used with my little
finger going in so I started using as an
eye primer and it really does work
pretty well so I'm using it again today
I'm going to just keep doing it but I'm
trying to think of a video like if I did
one that's like products I use in ways
they're not meant to be used or
something can you guys help me think of
a clever title now I've got to figure
out what other products do I use in ways
that you're not meant to but I thought
that'd be so fun I mean this is like the
front-runner this is the one so far but
I'm sure there are other products I use
in you know for different purposes on my
face than what their initial intention
was you know what I'm saying so let me
know if you can think of that and I'm
just curious do you guys use any other
part that might inspire me maybe to try
some other products in different ways
and I just think it's a great way to use
that products that you don't really like
okay so here's another example there are
certain bronzers I'll use like for
crease shades in my on my eye or
highlighters I'll use this eyeshadow
I've used eyes shadow as highlighters so
maybe that I'm now now the wheels are
turning see I just needed to talk it out
with you guys that's all I needed to do
anyway okay bye hey okay I see you I
need to update I'm watching some makeup
to clutters as I get ready and this is
one of my favorite youtubers it's
Kirsten she's kind of been in my eye
lately she will randomly upload but she
and I we used to even like chat like on
the phone um I just like her she's one
of those people that she's funny without
really trying to be she just is funny
and she's just honest and like normal
and I just like her anyway I will link
her channel and I'll link this video cuz
she her collections ridiculous I mean
look at all her foundations and she
first of all so I'm just excited like
I've been saving this declutter for
quite a while so I'll link the declutter
video as well go tell her I said hi
because I miss her and I want her to
upload more but um she reminded me let
me flip the camera around she just
reminded me like I haven't done it a
clutter in a while I mean it hasn't been
that long but um and I'll link my
declutter playlist if you've never seen
them but they're what have drawn a lot
of you guys to me
how are you how are you sticking out
that far um and I think that's awesome
cuz that's what's drawn me to a lot of
other youtubers like that's why I watch
a lot of other youtubers and anyway I'm
not gonna talk about why I love to
coloring cuz I could talk about that all
day but one thing I've noticed that we
all do myself included is we really beat
ourselves up if you're like really
hardcore decluttering you start to beat
yourself up about like not getting rid
of enough and and I think it's because
you know like I myself watched so many
and I'm like just get rid of a girl you
can do it just get rid of a girl like
that's me talking aloud to the screen
and like I feel like so then when I'm
declaring I'm like okay let's say I have
10 foundations and I'm getting rid of 3
by the end and then I'm looking I'm like
I should be getting rid of more so then
I like force myself to get rid of some
other stuff that maybe maybe I should
have maybe I shouldn't have you know
whatever and at the Rowdy is it's
totally your choice it's your decision
is your stuff but I'm starting to
realize like you know there have been
times that I'm like I should've gotten
rid of that like I wish I could compare
it right now and of course that's more
of like a YouTube thing but or just like
oh man I saw someone else use that in a
video and it I didn't think to use it
that way I wish I still had it you know
what I mean it maybe that's more of a
common thing so I guess what I'm saying
is the next time I do two clutters I
want to be better about not being myself
up like she's talking about this really
expensive foundation she has and she's
like ah and her reasoning for getting
rid of it is because it's it's probably
gotten old so that I get and maybe she
should get rid of it maybe she shouldn't
I don't know but um you know she I can
hear her saying like oh my gosh like but
I don't want to get rid of it she's like
but I really should because it is old
and I'm like I totally get that feeling
and I know so many of you guys do too
and I'm like you know if now if it
weren't being old like if you were
getting rid of it just because you're
like you think you don't like it if you
really feel that strongly and you're
like I really don't think girl don't get
rid of it you keep that foundation and
you don't use it you leave it because
I'm like I think I don't know am I
making any sense I'm sure half of you
guys are like what are you like you
probably don't even watched it clutters
alright I'm gonna shut up I need to fix
this eyebrow it's driving me crazy I
gotta like even that a little bad boy
out anyway um alright that's my two
cents I really don't know I think I just
circled around circle
and never really pinpointed anything but
okay all right if you wanted to see that
highlighter on I might have gone a
little too much for my tastes
come here light crap I should have
opened it before there we go
so this is that kilowatt highlighter so
I originally used like the more matte
satin side and then I put on the this
sparkly side just there might be too
much right I don't know I know some
people who I know some people really
really like this that kind of a
highlighter and I swear you little
awesome simplehuman mirror I'll link my
mirror it is awesome but you have to
like be right there getting ready what
to have the light on you know but it's
like actually decent lighting for when
I'm filming cuz otherwise like look how
dark it is come on
now now you won't go off it's still on
anyway um okay so I do like it but again
I'm still trying this is what I mean
I'm still trying it out cuz I feel like
like for me I'm like also that blush is
like a little too red we need to calm
that down okay so I'm saying this but I
just sprayed my face so it's still a
little wet but this is the cover FX
mattifying setting spray it's one of my
favorites for like when I'm wanting to
kind of get all of my makeup to kind of
melt together but I already have a
pretty stellar highlighter on so I'm
like okay I don't want to like add any
more glow cuz like there let me see like
peach mists is a mattifying setting
spray I don't know maybe it is I feel
like I haven't given this enough time
because because it's so highly
fragranced I don't love spraying that
all over my face every single day so I
kind of I like fragrance a lot of things
but every once in a while like in a
square settings pretty much I don't
necessarily want it to have a super
strong smell because I'm just putting
that all over I don't know I'm saying
that and they're like foundations I used
to have fragrance but anyway but I just
really like this cover FX mattifying
setting spray randomly cover FX is one
of those brands that like sometimes
they'll send me something some time I
know this light is driving you crazy I'm
just gonna Becca
sometimes they'll send me something
sometimes I'll buy something
and I'll either love it or hate it but
everyone smile I'll find a product of
theirs that I'm like this is amazing why
is no one talking about it and this is
one of those for me that I feel like
it's really nice so like right now it's
I just sprayed it all over my face and
it's finally dried but I'll usually wait
like five or ten minutes and look in the
mirror again and it just looks perfect
so I don't know what it is I have no
idea what makes it supposedly mattifying
but I really thought don't drop it Jess
I really really liked it and Loki really
loved the light green packaging is that
weird I don't know I really like it all
right today's cheese-and-cracker day is
joined by Tyler's homemade hummus and
some pita chips and some carrots and
celery Tyler what's in your hummus no
kids very excited about um what is in
your hummus it is so so good you just
start on the fruit food Pro I've made it
a few times but it's your recipe I do
every time anyway it's chickpeas tahini
lemon juice kosher salt garlic a little
bit of hot sauce you use like Tabasco
yeah that's just a couple dashes of it
so you really can but just gives a
little flavor so I think that's it I
will say this I'm not a big raw veggies
person I love them cooked I really don't
like most veggies raw but like hummus
that's about the only way you just got a
coat it and home I see yeah shove it
down but when it told me there I mean
that's all good stuff that's in there so
and it is so delicious you double that
recipe okay look at all that hummus huh
so I have a new mirror came in the mail
from this company called me Ravana it
was in an Amazon package so I think it's
sold on Amazon if I can find it I'll
link it it's kind of cool like it lights
up it's not nearly as bright as like my
simple mirror one that like ooh that one
really lights up your face apparently
this one can turn but you know like it
closes it's got these magnifications
interesting I'll have to try it like in
the morning like actually getting ready
maybe in tomorrow's vlogmas and let you
guys know you know is it bright enough
to get ready
with I'm a snob now that I've had this
this was like an amazing Christmas skip
it's not a cheap mirror you guys again I
can link this one - it's just not cheap
and I had asked for it for Christmas I
want to say maybe last year maybe the
year before and so it was like my
Christmas gift from tyre and I loved it
I mean it's not like $1000 but it's
definitely like around 100 if not more
so it's not cheap I'm not sure about the
price of this so like I said I'll link
this below - if you're just curious but
stay tuned maybe for tomorrow's vlog
that's all that you guys know in the
morning kind of how it is I'm so curious
I like that it's bigger I will say that
the one thing that this me relax
is that you know it's a good size but
like this is nice because with this one
you have to be all the way up close
because it's matte it's naturally
magnified whereas this one is normal so
like I kind of missed that with that so
then I'll pull a regular mirror over
here to do that so anyway um yeah yeah
interesting I just say how appropriate
it it is he's wearing this new Pizza
Planet shirt that we got on Etsy I can
link this one below I finally I found
the actual shop we're eating salad to go
along with the homemade pizza that Tyler
made do you work for Pizza Planet maybe
because actually this looks a lot like
the member of the Pizza Planet they had
at Disneyworld / now it's Pizza Rizzo's
name's Ethan
oh I was just collecting every smells
but no guys like I was - we've opened
out again you already had your dinner
pup-pup so we're gonna finish what they
called The Royal Tenenbaums finally
mm-hmm
we did not finish it huh I have some of
these I'm sweet sweet sweet cookies that
my student made for dessert I'm
dips on that one is that a lemon one two
there there are lemon yeah okay that's
all you I want to try that it looks like
snickerdoodle I don't know
I love homemade cookies we should bake
some cookies this year for Christmas
christmas is coming the goose is getting
fat what is the next one please to put
the penny in the old man's hat
you haven't done it didn't even cut
let's do is that only from Muppets no
song that they were kind of yeah let us
know below
someone's gonna know the answer to that
anyway so in old English Carol or
something like that yeah oh we are now
watching what is it Ken Burns the West
and Tyler's watched a lot of like the
you've watched the Civil War the
Prohibition one and I've watched bits
and pieces I'm always like ah like I
feel like you have to be in the right
mood for any documentary but especially
Ken Burns ones but we've been watching
like half of the first episode if you
will of it it is pretty interesting and
it connects a lot with what I teach like
in fifth grade so it's interesting to
hear just a little bit more about it
than what I just know and what I teach
and what's in our textbook etc but but
it was made in 96 so the people in being
interviewed like the historians and
anthropologists are definitely living in
1996 and it just makes me giggle it's a
different time then I was seven years
old that's crazy to think about Tyler
think about this if in 96 the internet
was around you know but it wasn't like
it is today it with like how much is
online like information wise so like
this actually would have been really
helpful if you realize like I think
about like writing research papers you
know I'm gonna put that in quotes
because I was like eight but you know
where you'd have to get like in cyclin
Lee get encyclopedias because you
couldn't just like look it up online oh
my god one point they sit down and they
I don't know google it I think it's
Google and I don't even know what
they're googling is like aliens or
something like that and they said like
they type in aliens and then they're
like oh my gosh there are thousands of
websites about aliens oh my gosh now the
reasonable probably Millions yeah
absolutely
I love seeing stuff like that time
changed very quickly Pinocchio Pinocchio
he's I'm cleaning it off what did you
say I went downstairs and he was in the
kitchen and he was up on the counter
licking something from Jessica's ice
cream bowl and Pinocchio was that
nothing stairs all over the floor later
open old here I get it off
now you're gonna be all sticky for a
while there we go oh you are the worst
it's super jerk okay it's like way too
dark right now I don't know okay we're
in bed watching Bob's Burgers we'll see
you in tomorrow's vlog bye guys I feel
like this looks like the Blair Witch
