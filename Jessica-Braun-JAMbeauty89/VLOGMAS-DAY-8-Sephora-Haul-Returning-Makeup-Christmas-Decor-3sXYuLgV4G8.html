morning and just seeing let me show you
like these are on the timer so they're
on when I wake up and the tree down
there I just think it's so pretty
also happy Friday yay as I was saying in
yesterday's vlog mist this is a mirror
from me Ravana and it just here let me
scoot to my little brushes out of the
way they sent it to me um for PR and I
was like hmm
I don't know like I thought it'd be kind
of gimmicky and I'm still deciding it
has to stay plugged in whereas like my
simple human one I was talking about you
plug it in to charge it but then it's
wireless anyway so the on/off button is
come on there it's got magnified here
but everything else is normal which
actually I like because the simplehuman
one is always magnified so you always
have to be really close but of course
the light on this is not nearly as
bright as that one so that's one thing
to keep in mind but it is nice cuz it's
bigger you know I don't think I'm gonna
get rid of it I think I'm gonna keep
using it and of course I haven't
actually gotten ready yet today good
enough to know what like it's very
obvious that it's not nearly as bright
as I'm used to but maybe this will look
a little bit more natural for me anyway
and so sometimes I'll get ready in that
mirror over there and then I'll look in
like a regular me and be like whoa way
too much because that is very bright so
it kind of washes everything out so I
don't know I'll give it a try and let
you guys know okay so I'm about to place
an order on Physicians Formula so like
they have so much new stuff and right
now they have like a 30% off code I'm
like yeah thank you but they have like
this new Rose oil lip polish this Ida
puffer rose they hold a oil free serum
this is why though this healthy
foundation I'm just gonna order three
shades because I want to do you know a
review of all this new stuff and let you
guys know about it so I want to make
sure I can get the right shade and I've
already looked in a bunch of stores near
me and I haven't found it yet I'm sure
eventually it'll be there
but I'm too impatient this spotlight
illuminating primer I've never ordered
from a brand's website like this like a
drugstore brands website so this is kind
of a new experience for me
I ordered or I'm going to order a few
shades of this healthy lip velvet liquid
lipstick this mascara I'm not gonna
order the brow I already have the butter
highlighters and I have the butter
bronzer and stuff so wondering some of
that and I'm ordering a couple of other
things too
I'm already spending more than I want to
but it's always worth it in the in the
name of YouTube and reviews but also I'm
just excited to know about this stuff I
really like this brand I wish they were
a little cheaper but I like to think
that many times they of course have
better ingredients and a lot of the
products than maybe other brands do and
a lot of other drugstore brands are
creeping up to these prices anyway and
at least Physicians Formula is typically
including better ingredients
so just want to make you guys aware I am
so excited I'm gonna be late for work
because I'm taking way too long to shop
online okay bye
cute stuff milk don't use I don't think
he's very happy about it he's got
attitude eyes for sure oh we ever shown
we might have shown this in a previous
vlog miss how does this turn on Tyler I
tried to turn on the other day and I
could no it was I double-check that to
was a broken see what I mean no it was
not good Oh oh my gosh I'm embarrassed
so this is something that was Tyler's
grandparents they got it
for those of you who've been to Michigan
it's Bronner's Christmas story like the
world's largest Christmas to our Lisa's
what they say is huge yeah we finally
went oh yeah
it's so cute I can't believe it so works
I think that's what's so awesome I need
to fix this Pinocchio as a tiny puppy
look at him he's like I remember this
let's see we had it on the ground that's
why it's up on this shelf this yeah
right Pinocchio there's need to be like
we're after yeah they're so cute I love
little like fake wrap to gifts they're
so cute my mom used to have tiny ones
that went with some village or something
I would always squeeze him that weird so
I wanted to show you guys one of my
favorite coffees you can turn that music
off okay um it's from all these it well
I say one of my favorites this is the
first time I've got it but I'm really
enjoying it it's their brand very sumo
creme brulee now it is artificially
flavored so it's not like naturally I
will say like the Starbucks vanilla
coffee is one of my favorites because it
has it's not artificial vanilla so it
really does have a different taste but
either way this is one of my favorites
like after work I'm just making a small
cup of this just to kind of like I
usually am like right now sitting now to
edit so um I really like it and it's so
cheap at all these it's crazy so I'm
just sitting here editing some stuff and
watching kathleenlights at the same time
and we realized this is the flooring
we're getting for our bathroom that we
just redid and Tyler had set it down as
we were talking and he was like oh my
gosh
Jessica look it is the dead-on exact
same clearly I like that kind of wood I
mean this is literally like fake like
it's really we're not doing expensive
floor know this because it's yeah like
60 square feet yeah that's really cool I
have a friend who's done it in different
rooms and it's perfect for like laundry
rooms and small bathrooms and things it
is literally a grape strip and you
literally just you put it down so easy
cut it to size I wouldn't recommend it
for like your kitchen or for you know
but if you have just a small little area
like a little laundry room this is
perfect and it's so cheap and it's so
easy to do you can literally special
comunità
yeah we like the week against this gray
yes
think yeah it's kind of hard to see yes
you can see there but yeah well see nice
ordering some on oh no we don't need to
love the PO ooh I told myself I'd never
say it that like so you guys are gonna
get a sneak peek of a Sephora haul and
my sneak peak I mean you're the only
ones that are gonna see it because I'm
not gonna do a whole video so I have
been battling with finding the right
shade of the lemare foundation here's my
here's where I'm grappling with this
I have bought three shades that is three
hundred and thirty dollars worth of
foundation one hundred and ten hundred
and ten hundred that's insane right
I bought this darker shade in linen and
I realized no way too dark 110 dollars
then I bought the shade called cream way
too yellow it was close it was close
then I finally said forget it I'm gonna
buy number two now the reason I was
buying these because I was gonna return
them then you guys made me feel bad cuz
you were like well you know that when
you to return things to Sephora they
just throw them away they can't resell
them there's nothing you know and I'm
like I get that but at the same time
it's like even if I hadn't put this one
and I'm like okay this is the wrong
shade I'm not just gonna keep it because
I know that they're gonna throw it away
I mean I hope you're understanding like
I feel bad I recycle I care about the
earth I care but I don't like wasting
but at the same time it's like but I
spent a hundred and ten dollars that I
worked hard for why would I not return
it to get my correct shade do you know
what I'm saying so I feel bad but I
really do think I'm gonna return both of
these I use them each like one time but
I really I was trying this out and this
is the correct shade for me it's the
shade ivory number two it really is nice
so anyway I just want to share that
because I do feel bad and I hear what a
couple it really was only like two or
three of you guys that were saying like
you know when you return them they're
just gonna toss and I'm like that maybe
and that is honestly kind of terrible on
the company you'd think like okay is
there a way they can pass it on to
workers if
I mean I don't know I guess it's hard to
sanitize them I don't know anyway long
story short I'm really excited to have
finally found my shake because I'm gonna
really try it out to do a full-blown
review after a few you know probably a
month of trying it is it worth the money
or not I also picked up some stuff just
for fun so I mean all of these are for
fun but you know what I mean these are
Sephora sleeping masks so I love the
idea of putting on I guess you can see
me here I love the idea of putting on
like masks at night so that I can just
leave it on you know I mean I obviously
do sheet masks and other kinds of
masking things where you take it off or
wash it off whatever but I thought this
was such a cool idea so there's algae
which is purifying and detoxifying
there's a green tea which they say is
mattifying an anti blemish and then
lotus which is moisturizing and
smoothing so these are very similar to
like the nub kind of packaging which you
guys know I love the nug ones but those
are once you wash off love this so I'm
excited to give those a try this was 100
point perk a little solid Beauty Blender
cleansing mark some samples oh the Laura
Mercier foundation primer and hydrating
I've heard is really nice so I figure
mmhmm you gotta go ahead and try that
and then okay guys okay Tati made me buy
this one because she was talking about
how like she would look at her skin with
this on versus not and how it literally
looked like totter or tighter literally
both when she was wearing this versus
not and I'm like oh my gosh and I think
she was saying she had it like on half
her face and the other half it wasn't
know like what this is stupid expensive
it's from Gil on its lore or whatever
primer I'm excited to give it a try I
will let you guys know again that'll be
a one of those you know is it really
worth the money or not
and then I got a new NARS radiant creamy
concealer only because I like having in
my collection because so many people ask
about it and it's not my favorite
concealer I'll tell you that um but I
talk about it a lot because I want to
compare other concealers to it to say
like hey if you like this get this
cheaper version etc so I bought it again
in vanilla did I get vanilla yeah
and then I also bought the Sephora
bright future gel serum because I've
heard a lot of people like this it's
certainly cheaper than the NARS and yeah
so I got this one in the shade meringue
which is their number two shade um is
that oh my god yeah random samples oh
this is a cuticle it's called the cure
ultra nourishing cuticle Repair Cream by
deborah lippmann again I'll let you know
cuz it's winter and who thought my
cuticles need it so that's kind of my
mini expensive but miniature haul also
let me know if you'd be interested in me
doing a products I've returned to
Sephora video not the lemare cuz that's
just a shade issue but like there are a
couple things like one of the palettes
the v's art palette the golden hour one
I'm returning it's already boxed up
because I just like I had it for like
three weeks and I wasn't using it I was
like why look how tired I look jeez
Louise
I'm not using it why am I gonna keep
this you know what I mean like I bought
it to try it out and it's okay but it's
the shades are so just like every other
palette I have and I was like this
doesn't make sense so I started to feel
guilty and then I was like I'm not gonna
let this just rot in my collection and
get my money back and spend it on
something else so anyway hmm I don't
know where I'm going with this I feel
like I was saying something and then I
forgot what I was saying
Pinnochio just wanted to check in to say
goodnight
he's one very hot Thai old beagle look
at that I did a lot of wanting with lots
of toys going places
okay so goodnight goodnight see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
