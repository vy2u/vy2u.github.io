not that bad but it ain't my most yes
okay so I am trying the girl on lower
primer today for the very first time I
just put it on it felt cooling and
they're a little you know like these
gold flecks I don't know if there's
supposed to be real gold or not for the
freakin price they should be but I don't
know like I feel like I mean do you
notice something right away I don't know
that I do and the reality is I don't
have big wrinkles to cover yet those
will come but you know I've got a little
fine line so I even kind of dabbed a
little bit up there because I've heard
this can be kind of firming I don't
think it's not like a long-lasting firm
for the rest of your life it's more of a
you know instant firming firming
probably only last few hours I don't
know
and again I haven't done a ton more
research on this I still want to look
into this more try it out more etc but
day one it feels kind of sticky and it's
been sitting on my skin for about a
minute now usually but maybe that's good
it's like a sticky primer for the
foundation you know that can be good too
we'll see I brought my other mirror back
I think that that my new mirror that
I've been showing that with the trifle I
think it's just not bright enough I'm so
spoiled with my simplehuman that I'm
like I can't do this I think I can't see
myself I feel anyway so that's my own
thing
not that I'm you know I'm gonna keep
trying it out but this might be
something that I don't know like maybe
I'll move it to my bathroom because I
might use it more in there when I'm get
it no but I'm not gonna I don't know I'm
gonna figure it out I'm gonna play with
it guys stop worrying about it don't
worry about it
okay so I put on the lemare in the
correct shade ivory number two I know I
know that my skin is neutral I usually
think my skin borders on warm but every
time I try like a warm foundation it's
so hit or miss half the time it'll work
out that I'm alone but when I use a cool
one it usually doesn't quite work so I
must just be more towards neutral I'm
slowly figuring myself out anyway so
this is they're very light neutral shade
base
Stickley and I tried the warm and I
tried the cool and no anyway so this is
it this is my shade and I'm so glad
although I will say I was talking about
returning things to Sephora and
yesterday's vlogmas I was looking into
it because I had sent a couple of things
back and you'll find out soon when I do
a haul update but I sent a couple of
things back like a month ago and I still
haven't gotten like my refund and I'm
like that was not a cheap refund oh okay
I'll spoil one for you one of the things
was that Tom Ford quad that I showed in
my original Sephora haul that was
absolutely terrible a pipe like I've
never in my life it was 85 freakin
dollars and it was worse than like I've
never even tried drugstore shadow that
was as unpigmented unblended it was
terrible I've never been so disappointed
in my like I was genuinely it was like
the shade orchid haze I can put a
picture on the screen right now don't
buy it
I've heard some of the other quads are
good maybe one day but right now I'm so
like sore about it that I'm like no I
will wait a while before I II try
another one um anyway I returned that
and I mean that's like that's almost
hundred dollars right there and I think
there was like another thing I returned
with it and I saw them got paid so I
looked into it on stores website and
typed in my order number on their return
thing and it said that they received it
but I saw them gotten the money and
you're you usually get an email when
they receive it as well and I even went
back on my email and found an old one
from you know seven months ago when I
returned something that I did get a
confirmation email when they received it
in their warehouse well I haven't gotten
that but it says they did so I'm gonna
wait a little while only because I know
Sephora is so crazy busy right now that
there's a chance that it's almost there
but I think if by this time next week I
still haven't gotten that money back I'm
going to probably contact them and just
okay okay that money back cuz that time
forward concept anyway so I'm really
liking it I just love this lemare
foundation so much I need to conceal and
stuff but it just like I feel like my
skin looks like it's like real do you
know what I mean and yet it still has
like medium coverage
oh it's no
oh my gosh
yeah ok I hear breakfast is $2 for the
whole break which isn't the same and
their coffee is free if you're like part
of the free IKEA family members over 3 P

we're wanting to redo our closets we're
going to kind of look and see if we can
figure out what we want to do here but
in the meantime be fast P are literally
building our closet right now

record a video and I'm recording a video
what am I saying I'm recording a vlog
list right now

am filming and you can kind of see my
setup y'all these are all like really
