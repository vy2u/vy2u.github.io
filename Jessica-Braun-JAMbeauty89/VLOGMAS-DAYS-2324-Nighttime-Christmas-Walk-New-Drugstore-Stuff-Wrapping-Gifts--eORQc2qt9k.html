snow is falling is it snowing outside
hmm
see let's go outside clean it come on I
love that he has dark fur because the
snow shows up on his fur it's so cute
he's like this is cold
coffee so sometimes when I'm the one
feeding him breakfast which I have the
past few days just because like Tyler
was good anyway doesn't matter
and so we've trained him to you know sit
and wait and we'll put the food you know
the couple scoops in his bowl and he is
trained to sit there and wait until we
tell him to eat and for some reason when
Tyler does it we both say the same thing
he'll say okay and then he knows he can
eat it for whatever reason about seventy
percent of the time when I do it I put
the food municipal nothing is different
he sits there looking at me and then
I'll say okay and he just looks at me
like okay like I'm saying like
everything I'm like saying it all the
same way any word and he won't just
crapped his head what stick towards the
bowl and he like touch the bowl and then
just looked up at me I'm like and so
then finally I walked away and then he
ate I'm like what what am I doing wrong
why I don't know why that makes me laugh
it's frustrating that's funny cuz
they're ideas you'll unit avenge it
doesn't really matter but Oh anyway so
it is Saturday morning my coffee just
brewed my lips are chapped um anyway so
today on the docket I know I'm gonna
work on some laundry we're we our trip
is in six days so Christmas is in a
couple days tomorrow's Christmas Eve and
our trips in six days so we are going to
do laundry today sand try to not wear
anything we're gonna want to wear on our
trip so like my new Disney shirts I need
to wash things like that so we're gonna
do that and he's gonna try he said to
put our new flooring in our bathroom
like I hope so it's a good day to do
inside project because you saw it is
very snow and the snow is like picking
up this is awesome we've had like small
snowfalls but nothing I mean this
already looks like more than we've had
this year which is exciting
good timing being on Christmas break
good timing anyway so
I'm gonna edit some video we need to
film you're gonna film a sit-down video
the two of us but we might actually just
film that like Christmas Eve morning
together and then I don't know if I'm
gonna film today I kind of I mean I want
to but I don't know if I'm going to it
just depends on how much I get done
otherwise just because I want to have
videos film before our trip so I can
have them uploaded so maybe I will film
a little bit today some tomorrow and
then maybe even some more before we
leave let me know if you'd be interested
in me I'm sharing like a what makeup I'm
bringing to Disney video I don't I don't
always like doing that because I have to
have it prepared ahead of time like my
makeup and then I always change my mind
like that's my problem so I could do it
but there's no guarantees that in the
end I won't swap out a palette or I
don't know
so I hate doing them because then I'm
like oh I feel like I lied to you
because I ended up trading out this
blush and I mean the reality is it
doesn't matter but let me know if you'd
be interested in seeing that I'm
watching whoa it's doing something crazy
to her face oh no it's just where I
paused it I'm watching Andre oh mighty
mighty Leone oh I love her and it's her
yearly favorites but I just pulled out
whoa
this notebook I hadn't even used yet I
got from Erin Condren like my favorite
stationery planner notebook everything
site so this is one I love that it's
flat and like when you open it you can
actually like open it and flatten it
does that make sense so you could like
leave the notebook open but it's got the
month of the year 2017 like Jessica why
didn't I use this sooner the good news
is the rest of its just a notebook like
once you get past it which is why I
bought it in the first place but now I'm
like well now I want to get on Erin
Condren and get another one for 2015 but
just crack this bad boy open because I
usually keep my to-do lists like in my
notes like on my phone slash computer
but I'm realizing I really am more
productive when I can cross it off
physically so that is kind of my goal
for this New Year's to be more organized
with paper and I know that's like
counterintuitive because so much of what
I do is online but I know myself and at
least with YouTube I really do better
this way and I used to be really good
about it and I got
away from it but then I just get so
disorganized so I'm excited to kind of
start this back up again
old school anyone else just oh I thought
I just found like another counter no
it's still too so T is anyone else
old-fashioned like that like you prefer
using paper for things I guess I'm weird
think Erin Condren website below it is
one of my referral links but I really
like it I also ordered those canvas
prints I got for my family I showed in a
previous vlog I got all of those on Erin
Condren as well I really like it I will
say though they're shipping takes for at
BRR
forever and I know that the things are
personalized and that's a part of it but
I mean it takes longer than it probably
should that's the worst part about
ordering from them okay so I'm making a
list of everything I want to pre film
before we leave on our trip because it
is for like a week and a half and then
I'm right back to work when we get back
so I'm gonna have a lot filmed I want to
get a lot edited before we leave and
kind of schedule to upload throughout so
I'm not away too long but I'm obviously
doing my jammies which are like my you
know play on Jam beauty 89 my jammies my
high-end version my favorite products of
the year and my drugstore version of my
favorite products of the year or that
I've tried this year but I also want to
do like a GME's for just generally the
worst products I've tried this year
however what if I call it like the
Slammys or the shammies or something
what is something that runs with that
ends in a me but that would be great for
like the worst products right this year
I'm giggling trying to think of it so
you guys let me know below and I'll pick
my favorite and that'll be what I call
it cuz I think that'd be so fun and I
think the organization of these three is
just right cuz I've done like where I
did eyes in one video and face in one
video but I think it was too much I mean
even still this is still gonna be three
videos but I feel like drugstore
deserves its own video and so does
high-end because and I might not have
something for every single category for
both but I think I can pretty much come
pretty close because I've tried so much
which is awesome and I have fallen in
love with so much but I've also hated a
lot so let me know your thoughts on a
name for that okay we may have added
like three more days onto the end of our
cruise because I wanted to so when we
go ahead actually Jessica literally
called me I was in I was in Ohio and she
called me and she's like okay so I was
looking at it we can add to we both
always do this that we're like hey so
let me slope this by you and so she did
you call Southwest urges change so our
Southwest flight and then we added two
nights at the end of our cruise so we
were gonna stay a couple nights at the
boardwalk we've both been wanting to
stay at the boardwalk for a while and we
have and you can't say more than like
two nights because it gets expensive
yeah so we were like two nights which is
because of the where the times our
flights are that's basically three full
days ish so we added that so we're going
to Disney and stayin at the contemporary
for like what four days don't like that
and going on our couple day cruise then
come and stay at the world I'm so
excited oh I want to rent a Surrey bike
on the boardwalk you just bicycle around
he's so cute so now we're booking some
dining reservations mm-hmm
i just opened a package from
wet-and-wild I'm intrigued to try these
out I didn't realize these are like
they're like liquid highlighters I
didn't realize how many they had like I
had seen like two and I'm like oh cool
anyway but they have their new palettes
which I am so excited cuz they clearly
heard our cries and they literally have
transition shades and all of their
palettes because that's kind of what was
missing from their bigger palettes a lot
of people have compared this system
really famous palettes right now this
one just looks so beautiful
reminds me of the modern renaissance
that when I know some people compared
this is their new comfort zone palette
which is it is different but again I'm
excited to have those transition shades
and then this one's called nude
awakening not a basic peach I don't know
if I said that comfort zone and then
Rosie in the air what else did they owe
their single shadows I'm mostly just
worried about this one brulee train that
one out some eyebrows stuff and then
he's precious I'm so excited to try how
freakin pretty for drugstore brushes
that's ridiculous
oh and then they sent over a bunch of
their cushion foundations
have to find my shade and give that a
try I haven't tried this I ain't really
heard anyone talk about it either so I'm
curious there's a website called Beauty
statement calm that I guess sells makeup
I've never heard of it but they sent me
some of this stuff so they sent me this
by Terry Baume De Rose lip cares some
matte lip paints from Galactic I love
the RMS beauty little things this is oh
it's their living Luminizer I always
save that for a good way cuz I already
own this and I freaking love I have this
one and I have the other there's another
shade I haven't so beautiful
Oh wet and wild also sorry the dewy
primer I'm so excited to try so that
Beauty statement they also sent this dr.
Denis gross like peel treatments thing
and a little nest candle which I love
nest candles so that was kind of
exciting I kind of I mean completely
exciting but I need to get all this
cleaned up because I'd like to start
planning my GME Awards and really going
through my makeup but I can't really
think straight until all of this is
cleaned up Tyler's fixing my wall needed
some touch-up he's fixing it mister cuz
we put this three-game switch in there
was just a one switch and then once
which controlled the outlet and so my
friend Ben and I installed this that now
has the light and the fan yeah cuz it
didn't have any central lighting or we
had to literally wire everything from
scratch because there weren't even like
if you move into a house sometimes
they'll be like a little ring up there
that you can just saw light fixture like
they even have that so we had to start
literally from scratch why are they
goodness Ben's like a genius when it
comes to that kind of stuff because he
helped me install these whatever but
this one we had to cut out a little bit
of a stud that was here so it got all
messed up so that's why I'm painting it
well thank you hey can you also paint
this section over there I just I just
stay in it so I could paint it
oh it's awesome this is so because if
you had a little TV over here and then
you decided that you couldn't see your
TV it was so small and I'm like I don't
even need it yeah I just woke it on my
computer now that doesn't really so now
but we painted around that thinking you
were gonna keep it and so anyway so yeah
thank you okay we got some RVs cuz we're
listening to Christmas music parked take
it oh really weird if you're gonna but
we're gonna do super creepy yeah super
creepy um we're just doing some
last-minute shopping and stuff hey yeah
we need one gift for my mom mostly
groceries this is like a normal shopping
trip for us yeah really we just need
some groceries
um but yeah so listen to Christmas music
get get one of my sauce I don't need
your judgment are you talking he likes
the beef and cheddar and I like this
just straight-up regular roast beef with
Arby's sauce mmm
two volunteers
be Tyler I picked something out
it may or may not involve macaroni and
cheese
it's very cute and it's on sale like
three dollars off but it's okay because
it's recipe negates cheats healthy
healthy options so we just brewed a cup
of coffee to share and we are gonna go
on a nighttime Christmas walk with
Pinocchio cuz he's been very lazy today
and it's dark out and we just got home
from shopping it's like 10:20 and we
were like let's just go on a walk now
and see all the Christmas lights in the
neighborhood bring a little dingdong
share a cup of coffee so we're kind of
bundled up enough it's not too caught
mean it's like 30 something but it
doesn't really feel like there's not
really any wind so I'm excited just
sounds like a nice relaxing evening
tomorrow's Christmas Eve which is so
exciting so we're done buying gifts
we're done grocery shopping I'm like
looking around now we need to wrap gifts
tomorrow
and tomorrow we're also going to my
family's Christmas get-together in
church together and then Christmas Day
we'll have our time here together and
then we're going to tie their side of
the family's Christmas so it's gonna be
chock full of fun and happiness and I
just love Christmas time okay it's
Christmas present wrapping time this is
something my mom gave me I don't know
maybe last year oh thanks we're watching
Bob's Burgers of course so the way we've
been storing it because we used to store
all of our wrapping stuff in like in a
bin that would slide under the bed but
none of our beds we have now work that
way Pinocchio just this was the
different smells anyway but this you
just hang up so we hang it in a closet
we have in the basement and so we've got
all of our wrapping paper for the year
and then like bows and ribbons and then
this through sperm I just recently got
we just have a giant basket that also
sits in that closet and it's got like
gift tags in the front tissue paper and
then oh there's more similar and then
we've got bags and boxes I swear it
useless more organized so this system is
working a little better cuz we can
actually access stuff without having to
pull something out from under the bed
you know open it digger out like this
it's easier to see every
thing and I just really like it so yeah
mapping time on Christmas Eve morning
cuz of course no oh also I forgot or
both oh my gosh so many bones I always
buy them after Christmas on clearance
- tags in their - I'm sorry get cute
ones hissing we try to save like we
definitely save bags we try to save bows
but sometimes those you're like okay
this bow is done so we've got a lot of
like fresh new ones this year which is
exciting
it really wasn't oh we should have a
tree on watching finally the Disney
special from me I've got a few weeks ago
maybe yeah and we finished wrapping
gifts this is how we started you know
you have all the energy but then you end
up with max for a lot of the rest those
first few looking real good little and
they were an easy boxes to rats yeah so
now on to cleaning all of this up
alright so we've got presents in tow and
we are headed to church with my family

parents house for big dinner and gift
exchange and we always since there's so
many of us like my siblings I'm one of
six alright
yeah and and then most of us are married
you know it's just too many people to
buy gifts for so we always see like a
white elephant if you want to play you
can bring one so that will be fun
and I'm excited to eat I'm already
hungry we got a few hours to go other
than that yeah so we'll check in in just
a little bit all right
christmas is coming the goose is getting
fat please do put up Lenny in old terms
