to do kind of my very first vlog and I
say kind of because I mean I haven't
filmed it yet I'm filming this intro
before I've even started but I'm gonna
be packing and I'm just packing for a
couple day trip to Chicago to visit my
friend and I'm probably gonna be
uploading this either once I'm already
gone or maybe even after I'm back so
keep that in mind if you're like
confused like wait she's in town but
she's about you know what I mean anyway
so I don't know what I'm uploading this
but I say kind of because it's kind of a
vlog but it's really just me and you and
me showing you what I guess that's what
a vlog is I don't know but don't get too
excited because I'm not gonna vlog all
the time I know some people have long
channels and they'll do it every day I
wish I could vlog every day if I didn't
have a job or school or anything like
that oh sure
I love the vlog every day but I'm gonna
try and do it from time to time just cuz
it sounds like it's fun so we're gonna
see if I enjoy it which I know that I
will but I'm just gonna give you kind of
a peek into how I'm gonna pack for this
trip it's not really like an
organization or how-to video it's really
just packing alongside me and I only
have a few more hours so I have to leave
so I actually need to get this done so
I'm just gonna kind of give you a
glimpse of my method of packing and the
craziness that ensues so here we go
here's the glimpse into my closet
I just realized I've never shown it and
I might I'm still kind of in the process
of reorganizing it because it's kind of
messy and it's driving me a little crazy
I've got like Disney board games I'm
such a nerd anyway so I'm kind of in the
process of reorganizing it so this is
kind of fun it's like a before and after
maybe I'll do a video on that too this
is the bag I'm thinking about using for
the trip and I'll bring it out it's just
my I've recently got an Under Armour
it's I mean it's a gym bag and that's
what I use it for here's a glimpse of my
gym bag but I'm thinking about emptying
it out because it's got a lot of
different compartments and using this
for my weekend trip it's got this thing
down here like for hot tools like a
straightener and you can put it I just I
think it might be great once I get there
I'm gonna have to uh you know walk a lot
and I don't want to have to have like a
Rolly thing it's snowy there so I don't
want to
Rollie luggage you know what I mean so
this would be easy to carry so I could
just have this and then my person I
should be good to go
there's my purse I always hide it in
there but yeah so we will see I need to
empty it out there look who came to join
hi buddy boy I have two pugs and this is
one of them Simba he's young and
apparently he has a toy so okay Simba
you can be a part but you can't jump on
the bed you'll get on all the clothes
alright so I've kind of narrowed some
things down to some outfits so one of
these I'm gonna travel in I think I
might travel in this video video what in
this outfit here this is a new cardigan
I got at Target tank top and then these
I'm gonna wear these boots the whole
time that I got recently cuz they're
just kind of a universal color I can
wear with every single outfit
plus it's snowy up there and these will
be good in the snow so it's kind of
perfect so this will be my outfit that
I'm wearing in and for that first day I
have kind of two going out outfits
because I figure Friday and Saturday we
might go out
that's not sure I think I leave Saturday
night I didn't think about that anyway I
don't know I have to out the O Thursday
night and Friday night so we've got this
outfit here which is actually like a
see-through long shirt that's really
really cute and then I have a black tank
top to wear under it because it is sort
of see-through and some really really
dark jeggings and then for my second
going out of it probably I'm gonna wear
this shirt and these heels were both
going out for both of the nights this
shirt with those same pants I think so
yeah and then this will be for my last
day just because I know that we're gonna
shop during the daytime this will be a
comfy shopping outfit I love this
sweater and then just some classic
skinnies with those same boots over
there so and then I got some PJ's just
one of my favorite this is one of the
well worn shirts from Target and I oh my
gosh I love sleeping in this and then my
Victoria's Secret little comfy pants
this I'm going to bring for when we are
shopping and going out just a wristlet
it can hold everything I need to shop in
my phone all securely so here's that I'm
trying to decide so I want to use this
back like I said and I did empty it out
and I love that it has like a sleeve for
like an iPad or something it's like the
lore and really thick line but I also
want to use this that I got recently so
hmm maybe I'll use both maybe I'll use
this as like my kind of impromptu purse
since when I'm actually walking around
with a purse I'll probably have this so
I don't know I got to make some
decisions here okay so I have decided
I'm gonna bring these gloves that I
recently got these Calvin Klein they're
like text ones that I can text with to
wear and then this is like one of those
headbands I'm gonna wear or I'm gonna
bring because it is really cold there
and we'll be outside a lot in Chicago
and then this is the code I'm going to
bring it's my um was it Kenneth Cole
what is it yeah Kenneth Cole really
really like longer one so I'm Warren I
think this is the scarf I'm gonna bring
but I haven't decided those are my other
scarves there so I gotta decide about
that I just realized I don't think I've
ever worn glasses in a video so here we
are okay so I'm trying to decide what
makeup to bring I think I know I have a
best here because I just filmed a haul
video too
I have I just got this one and then I
also got this one I think this is the
one I'm going to use because I
specifically bought it for traveling and
it's the Sonia Kashuk completely
organized bag and they're like pockets
everywhere I mean like on the sides
there's like 10 pockets just on the
inside alone it's amazing so I think
this is the bag I'm gonna use but I kind
of want to go through and decide this is
my everyday makeup drawer which I always
film updates but the thing is after like
a few days I start leaving products in
here that I like grabbed out of another
drawer and then I throw it in here so it
ends up being completely different by
the end of the like week or two until I
update so it's kind of it's like a
dynamic drawer I love it I just love it
so I know for sure that I want to bring
my favorite chapstick so that's
definitely gonna go with me oh my makeup
remover pen I gotta bring let's see I
think I do want to bring this because I
have been loving it and I think
especially if I'm gonna put makeup on in
the morning and want to go out later
that way I don't have to reapply my face
definitely gonna bring my eyelash curler
the good news is I'm packing I mean I'm
packing on the day that I'm leaving so I
don't I've already gotten ready for the
day you know what I mean so I don't have
to go back and get ready again in the
morning before I leave because that you
guys know
that is it's really difficult to pack
when you know that half of the stuff you
want to pack you have to use one more
time that morning of so so I'm gonna
continue to go through my drawers I
guess I can take you on the journey with
me I might bring turn inside like what
primer and stuff I think concealer wise
I do want to bring this because it's
really it's just so good you guys know I
love love this forever I hate that it's
discontinued but I think it's just
really kind of repackage and
reformulated but I'm gonna bring that
with me what else we have here
this is my messy hair oh I will need
deodorant for sure this is what I've
been using by the way it's very I think
I love it I think I love it um anyway
see over here see everything look how
messy I mean it's not messy messy but
for me it's messy like nothing is right
right now so I need to kind of pick out
what blush and bronzer I'm thinking I
might bring my hoola bronzer either that
or my chocolate Soleil mmm I don't know
I don't know highlight wise I think I
want to bring something fun like that my
soft and gentle it's really kind of like
it pops so I think I want to bring that
for that purpose I need to think about
blush I'm gonna go back to that mascara
wise oh I'm sure I'm gonna bring my
favorite my Rimmel I know that I'm gonna
bring that first three series okay do I
want to bring the all nighter it takes
up so much room I don't think I'm going
to but part of me wants to I need to get
like a small travel size or like spray
it into another bottle I need to pick
out what lipsticks I'm gonna bring this
is my favorite everyday one the the
revlon lacquer balm in demure i love i
might bring one of my MAC lipsticks I'm
not giving them enough love look I might
bring angel palettes I don't know I need
to go through and decide I need to
decide on which foundation today I'm
wearing this one because I did have my
Revlon BB cream in here and I hate it
I used it like once or twice I was like
I can't do this so I switched it out and
I've been using this I think it's a
little too dark for me right now but I
kind of like you guys can't tell in the
video I kind of love it
so I actually might bring that we'll see
I'm gonna think about it anyway so I'm
gonna go through some more stuff and
I'll show you what I decided on okay so
I've gone through my makeup and I think
I've decided on what
I'm a little torn though I shadow wise
because I'm bringing my naked basics I
think but the thing is there's no
shimmery shade so like like I said when
we go out I want to have that shimmer so
I was thinking well I'll bring my
mary-lou manizer as my highlight instead
of my Mac soft and gentle and then that
you can use this as a shadow and it's
incredible it's a really shimmery if
you've never seen it you probably have
but if you have I mean it's like a
gorgeous shimmery color so that will
work for that but then I thought well
what if I want to other shimmery shade
so then I was like well I could bring
some of these or I could just switch out
all of it and bring like my naked too or
I could bring this it's my friend amber
sent it to me the face kit by Rebecca
Moses in brown and it's got the Mac
Melba blush it's got some lip products
here and then these shadows but I don't
know it's really really bulky and so
then I was like well this is really
bulky too so I figure maybe I should I
don't know we'll see what I end up
deciding but um let's see I've decided
on these products I'm bringing this as a
highlight I'd trade it out I'm gonna
bring this primer the Too Faced primed
and poreless because I've not really I
don't know I feel like I need to use it
and try it out because I really haven't
so I put back my Maybelline one and I've
just got other products that I'm gonna
bring so yeah and then my brushes I'm
bringing I did decide I think I am gonna
bring this by the way I'm bringing some
of my Sigma ones for my foundation
concealer some elf one Sonia Kashuk a
lot of elf some more Sigma AI brushes
and then my Tarte curler so I might put
those in this little brush thing but if
I can find a way to fit them in there I
would rather do that because it's only
for a few days which I know this a lot
of makeup but hey I love makeup anyway I
might keep it in this brush roll but I
would love to be able to just fit it in
there and call it a day so we'll see
okay so I managed to get all my makeup
fit in here this bag is so so cool I'm
not utilizing all the pockets because I
the ones that are out here I don't feel
safe like putting makeup in and then
putting in a bag because I feel like
they might fall out so but I love this
bag I ended up going with just the Naked
2 instead of bringing a bunch of
different separate things I'm just
gonna bring that so that's solved so I'm
using this brush roll from Sephora and
I'm realizing this is a struggle I like
enforcing things in and then it's gonna
mess up my brushes so I'm realizing I
need to get something different for when
I travel with brushes I think I want to
get that Sigma you know the one that's
like the cups and you can buy it without
buying like a whole kit you can just buy
the cup and I really think I'm gonna buy
that because I can fit them all in there
without having to worry about squeezing
them into these things I mean this is
terrible
so crap I got to put this somewhere to
buy in my what am I doing here I forgot
a few things anyway okay okay I've
narrowed down some jewelry I'm gonna be
wearing with the outfit I'm going in my
silver watch so I'm gonna bring my like
rose gold one and then a bracelet to go
along with that so I can stack those
together this I'm probably gonna wear
this little silver bracelet I'm probably
gonna wear with that together and then
I've got some silver hoops for the
evening time my favorite little studs
and then my other favorite little studs
that are gold and that I'm trying to
decide if I want I just took this off
because I wanted I was just wearing it
if I want to bring my little J initial
necklace for my gold necklace or this
little like Lockhart one I might just
bring both because they're not gonna
take up that much room and I can never
decide and I'm running out of time but
I'm gonna put all these I think I might
I have like the this jewelry organizer
thing that I've used before but I don't
need it it's too much space I'll show it
to you but it's way too much like
storage for what I need it for I don't
need all that so I think that I might
just use this little glint and gleam bag
that I have and then I also have this
little thing I got in Chinatown that I
can live that I can hold like my little
earrings in so that might be what I do
okay so I've got my clothes rolled up I
just need to get them in the bag and
then now I'm kind of nearing down
toiletries I've just got my face wipes
and then I've been using this lately the
Argan cleansing oil to clean off my
makeup so I'm just gonna bring that I'm
gonna have to use face wash that she had
I'm gonna need to put this in a bag cuz
it's like already leaking okay I've got
my deodorant I need to decide between
these hair sprays I think
this one's almost gone and this one I
love because it really adds a lot of
texture so I think I'm gonna choose that
one and then I'm adding some makeup I'm
adding my son you Kashuk lipstick and
rosette that I love and then a mac
lipglass and fresh air I need to put in
my makeup bag got my toothbrush here
deodorant like I said this I use all the
time and I just want to bring it I
wasn't going to and I was like it's not
gonna take up that much space and I use
it my hair it makes it so silky so got
my daily brush cleanser so that way I
can still clean my brushes this just has
hair ties in bobby pins toothpaste my
pronamel this is you know what I don't
need to bring this this is like an oil
treatment for your hair but if I'm
bringing this I don't need to bring this
as well so that's not gonna go this is
almost gone I don't feel like de potting
it in a smaller thing and so whatever
I'm just bringing the whole honkin thing
who cares so this I'm not bringing this
Ida I might bring I'm I have my Misti or
in a travel oh but I also love this and
I never use it and this would be a great
time so I might still bring it I'm
bringing a brush that I use to kind of
blow out my hair because my hair is
naturally curly a comb this I used to
hold my hair back when I do my makeup
this I just might want to wear so I'm
gonna bring that as well I'm gonna think
about these things and then I've got my
curling wand that I'm gonna bring I'm
not gonna bring a blow dryer because I
know she'll have one so I don't need to
bring them okay so these are all of the
things now I got all my toiletries in
this soho bag here kind of stuffed I
found a bag for the oil oh is it already
leaking or is that no I don't think it
is I was gonna say jeez
but got it all zipped up in there this
is my curling wand I've got all my
makeup in there undergarments the shoes
that I'm not wearing there I'm wearing
the boots all my clothes are there these
are all things I have to have like I'm
not flying I'm gonna be on a bus but I
mean in my like carry-on if you will you
know what I mean that'll be with me some
magazines I just need to read through
them I have a stack of magazines I just
started getting them and I never signed
up for them and I've never been charged
it's very weird so I need to read those
this is the book I'm currently reading
it stinks cuz it's humongous but yeah
I've got my gratitude journal and then
my glasses and then these I want with me
because once I get off the bus it'll be
obviously freezing so my stuff like that
that's a gift for my friend I need to
like I might just like pack it away and
then like rewrap it if you will in that
like once I get there
so I need to get all this put away and
so here we go
oh also I'm bringing some slippers cuz
I'm like whatever I just want to be
comfortable all the time so I'm just
bringing some slippers of mine okay so
I've got everything in there I got my
clothes on this side and they're all
rolled up I have my toiletries bag right
next to them I've got this this is empty
for right now I'm just gonna bring it
with me I don't think I'm gonna pack it
ahead of time my makeup bag and then
under there I've got my slippers and
socks and the other pair of shoes those
heels I put this bag actually came with
a shoe bag so I put those in there and
then I have there's a side little pocket
and that's where I'm gonna keep my
undergarments so they're kind of out of
the way and it zips closed the only
thing I haven't utilized yet are these
outside pockets here and yeah that's it
oh and I didn't end up using this little
bottom thing here for my straightener or
my curling wand I mean I might if I
actually did have to pack it away hot
but I have it in the little heat sleeve
anyway so so that's all packed now on to
my little either I'm gonna use this in
my purse I've got to decide but yeah on
to that alright so packed up there I'm
pretty much packed up here in here I've
got my magazines my book I ended up
using my other new makeup bag just for
like my kind of my purse essentials
because in this bag there are no pockets
like at all so in here I'm just all my
kind of purses central's that way I can
find them as long as I can find this bag
I can find everything else like my
headphones my EOS balm my vanilla bean
Noel lotion chapstick my little perfume
gum I'm lactose intolerant so my like
lactase stuff but also have in here oh
oh yes my Palladio rice paper for if I
get a little greasy and then what else
Oh a pen of course so all of those and I
think I did decide I'm gonna go ahead
and transfer stuff from my wallet to
here that way I've
got my phone charger and I'm like I said
I'm gonna have my gloves in here too and
I think it's pretty much it I just need
to get my other Chargers in here so
they're with me on my person cuz
sometimes the bus has like a outlet so I
can charge stuff so gosh I'm almost done
okay so I'm all packed up I've got
everything I need in these two bags and
this one will go under the bus and this
one will be on the bus with me and
really I don't have much in this at all
it's really just those magazines the
book and then like my phone and wallet
you know what I mean
and anything else I showed you but it's
really not much so most of it all fit in
that bag so I'm really thank you under
armour you made a really good bag there
but I'm ready to go is this filming this
thing on I hope that was fun to watch
and I know that it was fun to videotape
vlogging is fun maybe I will do it more
often but if you enjoy this kind of
video thumbs that up so I'll know so
maybe I will do a few more in the future
not just packing obviously anything I
guess I certainly my boyfriend I have
talked a lot for like when we travel we
would love to vlog about our travels
because we have a lot of kind of trips
in our mind that we're gonna be taking
and we've already taken a lot this year
that I wish we would have logged so
that's definitely something in my mind
and and in his mind so yeah we'll see we
will see but let me know if you do enjoy
