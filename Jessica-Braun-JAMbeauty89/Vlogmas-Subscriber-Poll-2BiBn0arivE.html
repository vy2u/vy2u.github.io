and I never do videos like this but I
was like I want to know your guys are
two cents and I my Instagram I have a
lot of followers on there but not all of
you guys are on there so I figured
YouTube was the best way to reach as
many of you as possible my question for
you guys is question of the month is
should I do vlogmas I have been thinking
about it if you don't know what vlog
mrs. it's basically where you vlog
throughout december until christmas or
even sometimes beyond some people do it
every single day most people do it every
other day um but it's kind of fun
because it gives you a chance like kind
of a glimpse into a youtubers life and I
say a youtuber because I watch a lot of
youtubers vlogmas syriza's there's a lot
of pluralization said a word anyway um
so I'm wondering what you guys think if
I should do a vlog missed we actually
logged today and I'm going to be putting
that up if it's already up i'll i'll
link it we were wanting to do i have the
whole week off so we're going to do like
a um I don't know what we're gonna call
it like vlogs giving or something like
that where we do it the week before
Thanksgiving just for fun but also just
to feel out like okay how much work is
it is it even feasible that we could
possibly do this throughout the month of
December when I'm still teaching and
when we're preparing to go to London so
we know blog in London we always vlog
when we travel on his channel but just
trying to figure out a day to day we can
do it so I'm curious about your thoughts
let me know down below if you have any
ideas of how we can make it work even
better I'm absolutely open to any of
your ideas which is why i am filming
this right now and um i love you guys so
much and I will see you guys in my next
video thanks bike
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
