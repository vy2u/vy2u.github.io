so I'm wanting and thinking about doing
then and doing wait uh also it is
snowing Tyler look his first new of the
year I have no idea if it's gonna show
through I'm can you guys see it it's
like so slight anyway this is exciting
kind of time I was cleaning out our hair
place down there thank you for doing it
anyway it's November but we put our
Christmas decorations up early because
and I know I mentioned this a lot but
there's a reason because we're going to
London over Christmas we were like well
this is the first time we've like
celebrated Christmas together in our own
place so we wanted to decorate and enjoy
it before we leave because then we won't
get to enjoy it that whole like over
Christmas time so we have our reasons
even though really I just love Christmas
and wanted it up anyway Oh what I was
saying was that we were thinking about
okay I was thinking I have new brothers
up that I was thinking about doing
vlogmas which is where you vlog like
some people vlog every day over the
Christmas season like in December
typically some people do like every
other day I don't know if I'd be able to
do every day because I do work every day
and I don't blogging while teaching I
don't think I should do that is true
because we did the same thing when we
were in Paris we vlog every single day
it was so fun yeah so I'm thinking about
it but I'm trying to make sure it's also
feasible because I don't want to like
start it and then not finish it I can't
do that so um give me your ideas below I
think it would be really really fun and
I would still do my makeup videos
because I mean that's still my chinos
about but I would just also do vlogmas
on top of it so let me know what you're
thinking about I mean about anything I
guess cuz that's what that's like and
Pinocchio has successfully torn apart
his toys although probably didn't get
that out like Halloween it was a
clearance after holiday it was like $1
and the clearance been it's a little
spider but he's ripping the stuffing so
we're gonna take care of this Pinocchio
hey are you doing well your eyes look
crazy see look at all the destruction
I've caused ah ha ha ha so I just got my
mail from my old address and it's a
little late both of the things that I
had received were QVC things from
companies as a cosmetics and this is
two-faced and they've both already had
like their daily value so I feel bad I
don't ever have to post about this stuff
they just send it to me and you do with
it what you want but I always feel bad
because I'm like this was something I
you know it's a really cool set so if I
can find any info I'll link it below
like if they still available just maybe
not for the sale price I don't know so
but this set was from Too Faced I'm just
so excited all you need is love and
makeup and it's got a sweethearts blush
which I've never tried these it's got a
brow cashmere clay it's in Universal
taupe that's perfect um then mascara I
like that mascara and then two different
brushes and then a lipstick and then it
also came with little cookies how cute
is this and then it cosmetics one is
like their five superstars and more and
it's got their brow power brow pencil a
mascara lip flush which I've actually
had this before Jenna to say why I did
like it but as I declutter I gotten rid
of ones that I just wasn't using and I
wasn't using that so it's actually
really really nice I might see if a
sister wants this because I know that I
liked it but again it was just sitting
there unused so anyway one of my
favorites this is a celebration
foundation illumination I've actually
already showed all this on my snapchat
I'm sorry but it might have expired
already but anyway and then I've got my
bye-bye under-eye concealer and then a
brush and their brushes are seriously
they're stupid expensive that's me being
real they are dumb expensive but they
are so good so I'm really excited about
that so these are cool sets so like I
said I'll link whatever I can find below
Tyler
this fire roaring it looks awesome and
well he works we've got this guy doing
the opposite of work yeah no oh sorry
it's like yeah you gotta be so I'm just
sitting down here watching Tara babies
II love her and pick my toes and
drinking coffee it's a very enjoyable
morning to be honest and it started
snowing a little bit more out there but
then it stopped so I don't think it's
gonna be anything that's gonna stick but
it's still exciting I'm gonna make some
fried eggs my favorite thing in the
whole wide world so we always put capers
in ours just like kind of it's just the
best taste kind of salty taste but oh my
gosh if you've never tried capers
they're so good so the way I use capers
with eggs is all usually once I flipped
it like if you're making fried or even
sunny-side up if I just put a few on it
because just kind of goes to all
throughout so take our salt pepper snow
is really coming down now I doubt any
other it'll stick but man it's going
down okay how is it awesome they're
there so everything so good you get
better and better every time you make
eggs which is amazing because you were
amazing to begin with huh well I'm sorry
my favorite food this is true and
somewhat of an egg connoisseur eggs
right now we're watching try the world
box unboxing video that he just edited
we always show each other the videos
before we make them live which is fun so
we're doing that enjoyable silly he's
hoping for scraps I'm still PJs crappy
and he scrappy-dappy-doo
so Tyler what are you doing right now
that's so exciting
well we're getting a couple things done
first of all we've got this awesome
cutting board that we
are like every couple weeks or every
month you're supposed to like oil it so
it's oil and then we'll wipe off all the
excess here but it always looks so nice
after it's done that way you know and
then we use it like crazy yeah exactly
and then this we've never descaled our
Keurig Jessica's brother got this as a
wedding gift for us or not the descaling
sorry yeah you got it for our wedding
which is awesome we use it I mean every
single day but we've never descaled it
so we got this stuff and work it's way
more entertaining than it should be yeah
I'm like looking we're sitting there
watching it go away that's what it's so
entertaining it's ridiculous but it's so
crazy looking at like the stuff that
comes out and that's the third path this
is the third time has come through and
goodness gracious what's in my coffee
every day so I think I've decided that I
want to do a I know I talked about
vlogmas but Tyler and I were talking and
I was like I have this entire next week
off for Thanksgiving break I know that's
crazy it's awesome so I think I might do
like a vlogs giving all week because I
think that'd be fun and something
different and it'll give me a feel for
how much I can handle when it comes to
if I could vlog every single day or if
it should be every other day so I think
that'll be fun fun fun I've got vlog on
the brain anyway so I'm really excited
to get this started so now I know I can
title this video like vlogs giving day
one or you know whatever so I'm so
excited I hope you guys are too yeah so
get ready for this wow it's like
actually sticking the first snow of the
year and it's like actually a legitimate
snow this is pretty cool I'm glad we're
just in for the day I don't think we're
gonna go to the store we need to get
some groceries but we'll be alright did
you stand tonight cuz this it's really
really pretty yeah let me see this is
better huh here we go
all right Pinocchio has never seen snow
he's about to see snow witty very first
time Pinocchio look golonka potty
does not know about this coin
he's gonna be like where's the grass
there it is what is this vibe what do
you think goodness gracious I can't keep
them in that frame he keeps right
so Tyler we froze this candle dish to
try and get this candle out did it and
I'm making a crock pot meal
it's like quinoa we don't have any meat
here so we're doing like a quinoa sweet
potato stew yeah that's all snowy
they're not going anywhere so I haven't
even turned it on yet but I'm about to
add some quinoa what's nice is you don't
even have to cook the quinoa beforehand
which is awesome but there's like onion
and garlic and a bunch of spices so
we'll see how this turns out we
literally don't have like four of the
ingredients like we don't have
cauliflower here we just use our last
head of that so I don't know we'll see
how it turns out it can't be that bad
but yeah we have not it is 2:40 in the
afternoon and we are both still in PJs
my goal is all day to not change I'm
trying to be I'm so I figure I should

this all happened today clean this up
and we're both doing too many things in
the kitchen right now well we've got a
lot of em like we do scale the coffee
maker but when you're cleaning pull out

front head facing opposite direction and
wood chips everywhere that he's bit off
