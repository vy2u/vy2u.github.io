going to bring you a review and a where
tests and swatches of the ofra long
lasting liquid lipsticks here's the
thing
YouTube is oversaturated with liquid
lipsticks first of all and it's also
oversaturated with Oprah liquid
lipsticks swatch videos so I ministry
just watches on my arms today because I
feel like if you're wanting to see lips
lip swatch videos there are people that
do it way better than I do and also I
was just looking on Oprah's website and
they have an entire page of lip swatches
of all of their colors so I mean you can
start to see I just look so much oh
that's a shame oh that's the shade I
want so let's talk about the price first
these for the full-size which this is
what it looks like in the box and then
you know outside the box really simple
but nice packaging it feels well-made it
doesn't feel like super cheap but it's
also not like the YSL packaging you know
what I mean it's kind of in between
price-wise it's nineteen ninety I know
that there are like sales and some
people have to pawn codes and stuff I
don't have any coupon codes right now
but I do know that you can get them for
cheaper depending this is always things
going on but 1990 that's certainly out
of drugstore price as it is and you know
it's I feel like they're certainly more
expensive liquid lipsticks out there at
Sephora and at department stores even
still like if you found one shade or
maybe two shades that you really love
you know we're all the time I think it's
worth it so these have like a kind of
vanilla like scent it's a scent that I
love it's not a strong vanilla but it's
kind of like a soft like vanilla cake
but not in-your-face
vanilla cake does that make sense and I
personally love that smell but if you
don't like vanilla you might be bothered
by it but it's not one that like once
you're once you've applied it you don't
smell anymore
whereas I feel like some things like my
NYX I love this but this NYX lip gloss
smells like cherries and you can still
smell the cherry when it's on your lips
for a few minutes so I think if you're
sensitive to scent I don't think it's
too strong but it definitely does have a
scent so it's got a classic doe foot
applicator there's nothing really
special about the applicator but what is
really selling these is their formula
it's a very thin
formula which that is exactly what you
want in the liquid lipstick and you can
see I mean it's very thin and at first
you might think oh that looks kind of
patchy well as you kind of rub it in it
blends in so seamlessly and because it's
so thin it doesn't make your lips look
cracked or dry because when you get a
lot of products layered on there think
about like I did a two hundred liquid
lipstick layers on my lips it gets more
and more dry and cracks because you're
putting layer after layer after layer so
if you've got a thicker liquid lipstick
it tends to crack a little easier
because it is I mean it's almost like a
couple layers in one whereas this is so
thin I mean it's better than like a lot
of lip balms that use but the color is
still so pigmented that it just it's
almost like it adheres and becomes one -
your lip one with your lips but you can
still go and not feel like you're going
like sandpaper the shade range is out of
this world I mean they've got every
color of the rainbow every version of
nude red you know different tones cool
tones warm tones everything you could
ever want so let me show you the wear
test of me wearing it throughout the day
I was actually going for a birthday
celebration of my own with some family
and so we had lots of you know dinner
and drinks and dessert and so I kind of
check in and show you how it wears
throughout the day
2:46 my time and I've got Pinocchio out
there we're headed for some birthday
celebrations but I just put this on like
15 minutes ago and it's the shade Santa
Anas I haven't said it yet
so I wanted to do like check in
throughout the day maybe a couple times
to see how it wears without any
touch-ups so this is what it looks like
right now
I actually used a lip liner that's
darker but it's the only one I have near
this shade it's called Terry's choice
and it's a star look let's liner I don't
even know if it's sold anymore but it is
a little darker if you can kind of see
it somewhat like an ombre effect so if
you wants to be outside so bad so it is
439 and I just had dinner so you can see
there's like some corner where but the
rest is pretty good and I have like a
salad that has like an oily dressing on
it and like we had meat and green beans
and bacon on it and my head water so I
mean it's been about two hours after
meal that's not too bad we'll check in
in just a little way so it is 741 what
was it two for me something so it's been
like five hours and I had since I last
checked in coffee and tea and cake and
ice cream and water so well no but I
checked in in pantry so we're headed
home and you can see it's got a lot of
corner where a lot in the middle worn
it's still there and like from afar I
don't think you can tell and I was
asking my sisters and my mom knew I was
doing that so I kept asking them like
how does it look you know and I mean it
looks so put together but it certainly
you can tell it's wearing in the middle
especially if you're eating and drinking
so much I think if you were just working
and not necessarily eating and drinking
for like four or five hours it would
last way longer but this still I mean it
doesn't feel like uncomfortable like let
me rephrase it's not 100% comfortable at
this point but I don't like I feel like
every other liquid lipstick I've tried
that as it's wearing off it feels so dry
and gross this still feels a little
dislike you can tell it's wearing off
and a little bit dry but not to the
extent like I feel like they don't even
look that dry does that make sense so
not bad
Pinnochio what do you think just I got
to explore this carnac my final verdict
is that it certainly is long wearing but
it's not if you're going to be eating
and stuff you are probably going to want
to reapply but again it's most
comfortable when I've tried and you know
if I'm only having to reapply
once here today I don't think that's too
bad like maybe after lunch or something
just because I know there will be
somewhere but again like I said like
other lipsticks I tried lit liquid
lipsticks like all of that put together
this really is the longest lasting while
still being comfortable where I know
like I can go and not feel like my lips
are just crumbling into pieces so and
then you know here we are hours and
hours later and it still doesn't look
great but it doesn't look like horrible
let me show you up close one more time
in better way so showing you up close
you can really see it now but like I
said it's not like crumbly it just kind
of amazes me really I don't know what in
the world is in this product that it
makes it that way but so obviously it
wasn't perfect by the end of the day but
it really held on pretty well odds are
you're going to bring this with you and
so for me like when I wear it all day
long because I sell it like a week ago
when I'm going to wear it all day long I
feel like I'm going to bring it with me
and maybe reapply like half way through
today so then it's not as much of an
issue but what I like about it is that
you know I'm okay with reiha fun it's
okay that after you know six or eight
hours I might it might not look as
perfect as it did when I first started
but what I like is that it's comfortable
and it doesn't look cracked and that I
can reapply it and let it set again and
it looks just as good as it did before I
don't need to wipe it all off and start
over
it didn't make my lips all crumbly and
crappy and crazy where if I put more on
this it'll look worse it's just a really
good layering formula it's just a great
formula in general and I feel like at
the end of the day when I wipe it all
off my lips are fine they don't feel
like I just sucked all the life out of
them and then for two days I have
chapped lips no these are just it's good
formula I don't know what is so
different about these I don't know what
they've done differently with the
formula versus other companies but they
have nailed it
so I know a lot of people like the Kat
Von D liquid lipsticks but that's one I
would compare in my head when it comes
you know price-wise they're a little
closer in price and so many people talk
about that and while those are very
pigmented and I do think the formulas
still decently thin it just drives my
lips out by the end of the day I'm like
oh my god
and it really accentuates how different
like I'll put it on and I can like
within an hour see the difference
between my inner lip versus the might
the lipstick painted it just is so stark
that it looks bad and I just really I
wasn't impressed with that especially
once I tried these and fallen so head
over heels for them so check out the
swatches of
I would recommend while I really do like
the nude colors and I wear them
especially like the pinky news
I really recommend the berries in the
red because if you're trying for the
first time red or dark lips these this
is the kind of form of who you won't be
worried about it getting all over your
face and looking like a clown and so
this is one of those trustworthy things
that I feel like a lot of lipsticks you
try don't stay as well and if you're new
to wearing bolder lips or you know
you're going to be self-conscious this
is something that you know it's not
going to move so that I always
appreciate and that's kind of what I
would recommend if you're starting to
dabble in this kind of thing so
hopefully this is helpful for you guys
