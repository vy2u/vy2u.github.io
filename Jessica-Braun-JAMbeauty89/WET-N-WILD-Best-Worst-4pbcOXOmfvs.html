gonna share with you the best and worst
makeup products that I currently own
that are from the brand wet-and-wild
which of course is available at the
drugstore it's very inexpensive compared
to a lot of other drugstore brands I've
talked recently in videos about how I
feel like so many brands are like in
cahoots and they're like yeah let's just
start charging fifteen to twenty dollars
so you see if anyone buys it and then us
as suckers still by the fifteen dollar
foundations but when Wilde is offering
products that are I think every single
one of them is under $10 so I appreciate
that I appreciate that their prices have
stayed around the same as they have been
but I've got a lot here some of it I've
purchased it some of it they sent to me
in PR you guys know I always give my
honest opinion regardless because at the
end of the day if a brand is not sending
me things in PR because they're mad at
me for talking negatively about a about
their brand then well I probably don't
want to get PR for them anyway anyway so
um I've got brushes I've got
highlighters lip products eye shadows
for sure other things like that brow
products concealer so let's go ahead and
get into it my hair do you are like I
feel like I've had like a month of my
hair not doing what I want it to do so
like I've been air drying it so much and
I feel like my hair is so thankful for
that but then it's kind of lamp and I'm
like oh and then I'm like well I could
put hairspray and I'm like no but then
you're just putting gross stuff in here
like I can't
and so I my last video I just filmed
about facial oils I had my hair down and
now I'm like now it's up and I'm like I
don't like it
okay okay okay stop just stop
grow let's go I am wearing a ton of wet
wet and wild on my face I tried to use
as much as I could so you could see what
it looks like on I've been wearing it
for a few hours and what's kind of
interesting is you know I've been trying
these products for months some of them
I've had for months and months and
months but some of them I've been trying
for maybe a month or two and it's
interesting to like really pay attention
and see them in the light and I'm like I
don't know that I like that very much
so okay where to begin let's just start
let's start there brushes just because
I've had a lot of you guys ask about
them they're so pretty
I mean seriously these beautiful light
pink blush brushes and I have some eye
one so I've got some face
I feel like I have some more that I
couldn't find in my drawer they're like
buried but I've recently washed these
and anyway I think these are very very
nice I feel like you are hard pressed in
a physical drugstore to find good
brushes I don't mean Ulta because I feel
like Ulta they have a decent amount of
more inexpensive brushes but I mean like
a regular old drugstore Walgreens CVS
you'll see like they're brand new
brushes and some of them are good some
of them aren't you might see like Revlon
will sell like 2 or 3 brushes and their
thing and I'm like they've been selling
the same ones forever and anyway but it
was so exciting when one wild released
these cuz not only are they pretty good
brushes but they're cute you know what I
mean I feel like oftentimes when you're
saving money they're not spending as
much in the packaging and what it looks
like which I can understand I totally
get but it's nice when they do and so
like the face brushes I don't think they
have the name oh this is the p60 this is
a domed brush these are super soft all
of them they clean really really well I
just recently cleaned them and I are you
saying that okay um this is nice I
actually like it for like bronzing it's
big but not too big you could maybe use
it for like powder all over the face
although I don't I don't know I'm kind
of realizing what myself I don't love
domed things like this for really
anything because I feel like I can't be
as precise as I want I'd rather it be
more even not domed but tapered I'd
rather it be a more even dome just so I
can be a little more precise um this one
is their p55 and you can like there's
like a little hole here you could squirt
foundation into and then you know go
like this you could I've done it and I
was like there's not really a difference
between doing that and just putting the
foundation on your face and just doing
that I guess maybe you're not getting
your fingers dirty so it might be worth
trying I do think it's actually a pretty
decent foundation brush I was able to
get everywhere I needed to get I can
even get into these corners by using the
side of this so that was pretty cool
and this one I haven't had a lot of use
for it's the p50 it's really really thin
I know a lot of people will do like
stronger contours or little contours
there I've even heard some people do
their nose I don't contour my nose you
can probably tell
but you know it's it's very very dense
again very very soft you could totally
use it for that purpose if this is like
up your alley and I do I know they do
have sets this might have even been a
set okay my favorite brush out of all of
these is their p20 it's just an awesome
I brush just for blending the crease
I've used it a ton this is just my
favorite style of brush period in any
brand
another one is p15 it's more of a shader
brush so I'll just pack shadow on the
lid oftentimes when I'm doing lid shadow
like even what I used today which is wet
and wild I'll tell you in a second um
I'll just use my finger just cuz I feel
like it's a little bit more intense when
I do but still soft this one is their
p25 I've used this for concealer I don't
know what it was marketed towards but
it's it's a you know these are synthetic
and it's just really good at working
with like liquid products and then this
kind of more detailed brush the p10 it's
a detail crease very nice so I like
these if you are in need of brushes
absolutely they're they're nice I mean I
I really don't have anything negative to
say about them let's talk again a lot of
you guys have asked about these there
are new cushion foundations I wear the
shade light ivory it's actually a
perfect shade match for me I've tried
their little sponge there's the sponge
is fine it's better to just use a wet
Blender sponge whatever you want to use
because you can really get in there and
you know if you're used to applying
things with the sponge trying to go to
using this where you have so much less
control to roll it onto your skin it's
just difficult and getting like for me I
would notice I could not get in my nose
so that I'm pulling in a brush anyway
and I'm like and then anyway so I just
have learned that it really is easier to
use it that way I have I find that it's
it's nice but it doesn't stay on as long
as I want it to
it's the coverage is okay it's but I
would say like medium coverage there's I
like it as much as I like any other
cushion foundation I do like this
because I feel like it's a very fresh
look but I wish that fresh look lasted
longer so my favorite way to use this
and the way I've been using it a ton is
if I notice that I've got a little bit
of redness still going on on my cheeks
anywhere like that that's when I'll grab
my sponge and just quickly apply this on
top of it it instantly covers it and it
looks it doesn't make it look cakey it
looks very fresh so I think it's a good
cushion foundation I found a few others
that I like that are way more expensive
but I think I like this just as much as
I like those so I think if I were to
repurchase one I just go with this one
for how I use it
now if you use cushion foundations every
single day I don't know if you'd like
this or not because I don't think it
lasts a long time but hopefully that
made sense
all right brows they have this I still
have some other shades I haven't opened
it's their retractable brow pencils so
on one side and I'm wearing ash brown
today on one side you have the pencil
it's kind of a thin triangular shaped
little pencil here and then on the other
side of course you have a spoolie I was
surprised how much I liked the spoolie I
feel like it did a really good job of
kind of dispersing the color throughout
my brows and the color was really really
creamy like really creamy and I tried
some high-end ones the same shape the
same setup and format that just are not
nearly as creamy and so that I think
made this easier to apply because I
could brush it through make it look a
little bit more even if I wanted to and
I really liked that about it here's the
thing because it's so creamy that color
like I would go and the color would be
gone so you almost have to like wait a
while for it to set and even then I mean
you could put on brow gel that might
help hold it in place a little bit
better but it is really creamy so it's
kind of one of those things that you
know I guess maybe I could even like
almost powder with like loose powder my
brows but I don't want to go that extra
step so do I think it's nice yes I just
think you have to be aware of the fact
that it is that creamy and it might move
on you
and that could be a shade thing but I do
think Irish Brown is a pretty good match
for me I might have been able to get
away with the dark brown because I feel
like this now I don't know that it kind
of pulls red but not too red so but I do
really like it it's one of the better
ones at the drugstore for sure in like
what I always say especially with these
brand videos because I've done a lot of
best and worst videos the time to do
this is when they're doing like a crazy
sale I
walking's is doing 40% off of all wet
and wild that's the time to go in
because these are already inexpensive
but if you know you're gonna buy a few
products just wait for a sale wait for a
coupon or both next product is these
hello halo highlights I have like
literally every shade they got some nice
golds and pinks and bronzes and but I've
really focused my time on the one that I
felt would be the best for my skin this
is called halo goodbye and I love you
can of course shake it up it's like a
glass bottle I think I mean it certainly
feels like it um so that's kind of nice
and I love that it's a dopa and it's a
fat doe foot I don't know what it is
about this but liquid concealer no
liquid highlighter can be tricky as it
is to apply especially if you're a
beginner or you're just kind of new to
that or maybe you don't typically like
that typically the reason I used to be
intimidated by liquid hilar so I was
like I don't really not apply it so with
this what I did today is I just went dot
dot dot just right on my cheekbone and
then I just took the side of my sponge
and I just kind of press it into the
skin and I kind of brought a little bit
up I took the sponge I'd already used
and just put a little on my nose a
little up there and it really does
impart a really nice glow it's nothing
crazy like you can see from space but
again it's that healthy glow that if
you're using a lot of matte products you
kind of want that glow back or at least
I do and this was a shade that was great
for me so with them I was I was kind of
impressed with the shade selection of
the highlighters I think it's a cool
format probably one of the best formats
for a liquid highlighter that's out
there and really a lot of liquid
highlighters perform the same this is a
thinner thinner formula so if you're
used to like the Beckert becca
shimmering skin Perfector liquid that's
a lot thicker so I think that stays on
better throughout the day but I haven't
really noticed that it this doesn't stay
on throughout the day does that make
sense so you know do I think it'll stay
on for 20 hours maybe not but do I think
it'll stay on for ten to twelve yeah
alright next product is their new
eyeshadow palettes so this is what I'm
wearing on my eyes today they redid one
of their palettes that I had loved for a
long time and then they came out with
three new ones so the one I'm wearing
today is
comfort zone and they added some shades
they really added transition shades to
their palettes and that was huge because
a lot of us for years have just said you
know I love these palettes I just I
can't do a complete look because I need
something to blend with so they did a
great job the transition shades are on
the outer portions of the palette and
then they always have eight shades in
between that could be shimmer matte both
a mix um this has a lot of shimmer in it
so what I did today on my eyes is I have
this well I have a single shadow I had
the single shadow and envy all over my
lid now I did use like a white primer
the NYX white primer these singles were
so hard to open but I'm using this shade
Envy on top of that white primer and it
ended up pulling a little blue once I
put it on and I really was wanting the
green look to come out so once I put
that on and I was really impressed with
that I went into the comfort zone and
grabbed this green here and put it on
top and it really kind of amped it up I
didn't feel like this green was as
powerful as that and that's why I went
with this but when you put it on top of
it it really did make it a lot more
green I've got it on my lower lash line
too so impressed even more so with the
single shadows when it comes to like
color punch versus the colors in the
palettes and I've kind of noticed that
across the board but I think these blend
really nicely I'm using I use this
orange transition in my crease I use the
more burgundy color in my outer corner
these are really really pigmented I've
noticed they did a really good job with
the transition shades especially because
those need to be highly blendable for
them to actually work the way we need
them to work you know what I mean if
they're not then it's not going to work
so I just I'm really really impressed
now the other palettes they came out
with this one is one that a lot of
people feel as a dupe for the anasazi
'modern renaissance it's there Rose a in
the air palette really really pretty
colors I love these to transition shades
there's a cooler tone and a warmer tone
they have some pinks they have some
shimmers their shimmers are okay they're
not bad they never have that like
shimmer punch that I
they might have the color punch but they
never have the shimmery like ridiculous
foiled look that I sometimes want on my
lid they're still really pigmented for
example this one called nude awakening I
thought oh these shadows here are gonna
be so pretty on the lid they really they
they weren't not pretty but again they
just didn't they're really powdery they
just didn't pack the shimmer punch that
I wanted so you got to kind of keep that
in mind but we've got a matte black in
this shade that is just like out of this
world really really pretty if you're a
cool neutrals girl you'll love this and
then the last one is not a basic peach
and it's got this really fun blue color
in it what's interesting is this color
right here looks so similar to that one
and this one's not as pigmented so again
that's that Envy color I just showed you
that single shadow it really does turn
blue the longer it sits it's so
interesting but this one had some more
you know like kind of peachy bronzy
pretty colors that again the color is
gorgeous but it's not as shimmery as you
might want I don't know you might not
want it at all but I was I mean look at
these
that's the drugstore that is inexpensive
drugstore and they really really are
impressive do I think you need all four
of these no do I oftentimes pull these
out and have all four open and I'm
dipping between them for looks yes so
you know you've really got to look at
the shadows and decide okay which one am
I actually gonna use I don't need all of
these you know and they're gonna be
there a while but I'm just so excited I
like the format I like that it opens to
the side I don't know why I like that
but I do cuz originally they were big
and they opened that way alright so I I
don't know that I have a favorite of
these to be quite candid because really
they're all really good and it totally
depends on what you like on your eyes
next product are there liquid cat suits
I'm wearing one today these are liquid
lipsticks they dry down to a matte very
quickly they're really inexpensive they
have a good amount of colors this one's
called Missy and fierce and it's like a
bold red the I mean these are really
nice liquid lipsticks if you don't mind
a very drying liquid lipstick which most
are then you'll
like these I don't think there's
anything wrong with them this is the
berry recognize however that's right
there if you know that you don't like
that dry feeling you're not gonna like
these that was kind of when I was first
trying these out a long time ago I just
kind of realized I'm like I don't love
these I like I like them a lot but I
don't reach for them often just because
I just don't like that dry feeling so
this is the shade I'm wearing right now
this is called give me mocha they're
really pretty like I said they're really
cheap and if you want a bunch of
different colors if you're just starting
out or you just want to see like oh I've
never tried a liquid lipstick let me see
if I like it these are great ones to try
but because I don't like that dry
feeling I ended up putting a gloss on
top this is actually a weird gloss that
I don't think I like but in case you're
wondering
it's a ultra it's a colour-pop ultra
glossy lip in a toll the color is pretty
but it was just okay but I have to put
something on top of them just because I
feel like I don't know again you have to
know what you like if you like that
liquid lip then I think it's okay it is
definitely a thinner consistency whereas
like the Milani
liquid lipsticks the amore matte lip
creams I like those a little more cuz
they're a little bit more whipped and
creamy but again they still dry down to
that dry feeling so okay next product I
want to talk about is their photo ready
concealer no photo focused concealer I
have that on today I do like it I do
think you need to set it it does crease
a little bit not as bad as other
concealers I've tried but it definitely
creases like most do just a doe foot
applicator
I think it's nice because I the coverage
is medium it's not a full coverage
concealer but it's nice for every day
and I feel like you know I used it a
little bit to clean up down here I just
put a few dots and blended it blends so
quickly and I really appreciate that I
feel like some concealers are so finicky
to work with and this one's not it just
blends quickly no matter what you're
using it looks nice you look more awake
and again for the price you can't beat
that considering there are more
expensive ones out there that don't work
as well as this on that same vein from
the photo focus line this is their
pressed powder I have this on today I
actually might put a little bit more on
my nose just because I feel like my nose
always red just like to get that region
just a little bit very thin powder but
it packs quite a punch you can't really
see the swatch I have it in the shade if
you're curious well I don't even know oh
there we go
8:21 ii it's warm light it's just okay
they don't have a great shade range
which is a huge no-no and it's just all
right I mean if you're like in a pension
you just need something to soak up oil
okay but I feel like it looks powdery I
never find myself reaching for this
anymore
it's just not something that I would
ever repurchase this a lot of people
loved I didn't like I put this on on top
of the hello halo that I had on every
time I wear this I feel like it just
looks bad
like it looks patchy I've done it a
million ways so this is the mega glow
highlighting powder I used to own all
the shades they sent me I've declared it
all but one and this is in the shade
precious petals this is the one that so
many people like does it swatch pretty
kinda yeah do I think that it's anything
to write home about no I feel like every
time I wear I mean don't you feel like
it's just like sloppy and I'll wear a
million other highlighters and none of
them look like this so I don't know
maybe you've got to have the exact right
skin tone for this shade when it
swatches like I said I mean it swatches
it's soft it's a pretty color but when I
put it on I just feel like it meshes
with like my freckles and things really
weird and it I don't know it just never
looks the way I want it to look and so
for that reason I don't recommend it but
you know it's inexpensive it's a couple
dollars if you're dying to try it try it
decide for yourself because I know so
many people do like it and maybe it just
depends on your skin type as well
another product I wanted to mention
where their eyeshadow singles they have
a new brulee which here's my old one old
new my favorite single shadow of all
time because it's just a beige color
which for my skintone is perfect for
blending I'll use this every single day
underneath or right above my eye primer
just to kind of tone it down but it also
cancels out a lot of discoloration the
new one is even creamier like it's it's
definitely powdery I mean I'm gonna fly
through this because
I feel like you dip your brush in the
powder is everywhere but it is so good
at its job that I'm like it's fine like
I still love it but it is definitely a
lot more than the original brulee the
original brulee is a little bit deeper
of a color it's very slight but it
definitely is so I really like both I'm
gonna keep both for a while but you know
I'm not upset it's still really really
good they have a lot of like I showed
you envy that one's really really pretty
but it looks green definitely pulls a
little bit blue like I said but I do
really like it they also have nutty
which was another one of their original
colors and this one again they all kick
up a lot of powder it's such a pretty
color though this is one of those colors
you could just put all over your lid
blend it into the crease and you're done
and it looks more dimensional like you
took a lot of time but you didn't and it
was like a dollar ninety-nine it's a
really pretty color I do think I don't
have the original nut anymore
I think this is lighter than that color
I might be wrong I know some people have
done comparison videos because they
already own the old ones I have it but
it looks pretty and it's got a nice
shimmer to it I really like it they also
have this blue shade called moonchild
it's really really powdery like I said
all of them are but it is a really
pretty Navy it's a true Navy though so
when you look at it it looks Navy you
think oh it might pack like a nice color
it it does but it kind of goes on a
little deeper than you might expect but
it's still really pretty this would look
really pretty on a lower lashline um so
they also have a matte black called
Panther did I cover all those they have
like a shimmery white called sugar I
wish there wasn't shimmer I kinda wish
it was just white alright so they also
have this purplish shade called
mesmerize which is really really pretty
so then they have all these glitter
shades and I can remember these from
before so this one's called nude cover
and I think this one's new it looks like
a rose gold I was ready to roll my eyes
because the ones I tried before it was
like this really weird like goopy clear
gel where there'd be a little bit of
glitter this nude cover one is literally
a cream shadow look at that that's right
there isn't that unbelievable the silver
one is called spiked and this one has
true
true glitter so this is one of those
kind of older ones that just has like
pure glare it's like a clear gloss with
glitter so the only way I would say you
could use this is if you wanted to just
pile it on top of something guys I feel
like the deeper you go the less glitter
there it's just kind of an odd formula
alright I wouldn't recommend it I mean
it's a couple dollars if you're using it
like for a look for Halloween go for it
because the top layer is definitely full
of glitter but as you get deeper it just
gets kind of weird so this is another
cream shadowy one called toasty where
it's got quite a bit of color all
throughout it's so pretty
just a really pretty gold I mean I was
so impressed with these so this is the
shade karma and it's another kind of
cream shadow but it's like black it's
just interesting I think this one is a
little more see-through but once you
kind of pile it on it's not very like a
gunmetal so that's it those are all of
the wet and wild products I've been
trying out lately now I've got all these
beautiful colors on my arm so I will
have all of these listed and linked if
you're curious about them or the prices
of them of course the price of them
depends on where you're shopping you
know what I mean but other than that I
hope it was helpful if it was I hope
you'll give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
