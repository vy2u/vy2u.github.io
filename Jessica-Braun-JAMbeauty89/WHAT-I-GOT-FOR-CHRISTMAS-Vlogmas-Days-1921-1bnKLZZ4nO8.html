is today happy I'm Saturday losing my
mind losing my mind so I got a bunch of
new tools in the mail and I'm very
excited about them I'm gonna show you
real fast it's not even Christmas yet
tomorrow's Christmas well I mean it's
not in the mail today so I'm so excited
so I got a company I worked for theirs
they are gonna discount their DeWalt
tools and I'm like you know what I'm
gonna get some so this was a four piece
set and it came with lots of okay I got
four power tools and they're really cool
that is awesome that's all yeah I told
Tyler for my birthday what do I want my
birthday's in January and easil I'm
gonna make you an easel for your
classroom yeah because I have so much
like I've had to buy the tools cuz yeah
well like I already have a couple of
these I already have like a work light
like a cordless work light and a
cordless drill but these are such good
deals as well sweet so Tyler is also
gonna work on hanging this painting up
that we got there you go okay that's
awesome I just moved from my old little
jewelry box here that I've had for a
while to this newer one and it locks I
have like no real jewelry so I'm not
worried about which is why I'm willing
to show you guys but it's just so cool
there's lots of little organization
things and I just really like it and it
even came with this little like travel
case I don't know if I'll use it this
trip or not but I think that's pretty
darn cool I was so excited about this so
I tried Tyler's recipe for the eggs yeah
we're gonna see if they're any good it
was interesting I had to be
more patient I'm so impatient yeah a lot
of like Americans like you know just
like the classic diner to go in they
flash do the eggs and you know three
seconds and boom they're cooked so this
is just a little different so I just
finished filming like an alcohol and a
travel video and then Sephora slash many
more haul and he's helping me get like
some thumbnails and right behind the
scenes look I just learned that our ring
light goes higher than it does I should
have known that should be the most
obvious thing in the world but um
dum-dum jesse did not know but and then
we're working on we're gonna do an elf
um nail because the one I do girlier
kind of stinks so this is awesome
and Tyler you help me get close-ups
today and everything you never helped
before but you always offer in this time
I was like yeah I'm gonna want you're
out there's a lot of things pretty fast
well cuz you're you know what you're
doing I'm just an idiot I'm serious
you're so cute
Tyler's dead I'm so tired I know I am
two minutes on the next seven let's just
go to bed like maybe though no Qisas I'm
tired come on guys let's go play yeah so
this is the chocolate orange that
Pinocchio really wants that my mom gets
me every year for Christmas like ever
since I can remember and it's officially
time to eat it chunk do you think oh I
think it worked yes if you are not
familiar with chocolate oranges you're
supposed to whack them and then unwrap
them and enjoy them and it literally
yeah when you unwrap it nope you know
chocolate for doggies it's like a little
orange nose I don't know I've never
heard that rule Wow and then when you
peel it out you whack it cuz it breaks
it apart
they're like little orange slices
pretend I mean you know but it's dark
chocolate orange zest oh it's so good oh
yeah
and you get none
so I'm sitting down with some tea and
I'm trying
it's called Prince of Wales tea I've
never heard of it but we had ordered a
bunch on Vitacost and a while ago anyway
I'm just trying it for the first time so
it's pretty good and I'm about to wrap
Tyler's gifts her cup for our Christmas
tomorrow and Pinocchio got into the
gifts Tyler got for me and ruined one of
them and that was a matte lipstick in
velvet teddy that I have wanted for like
three freaking years so I'm so sad
anyway it's like ruined beyond anything
so we're gonna look for while we're in
London to see if we figure that's a fun
thing we can purchase there just kind of
turn it around but Castle I'm watching
some Rick Steves London videos he said
where's my phone and then you stop
talking like paparazzi I like your robe
happy Christmas
happy Christmas it's not really
Christmas it's our Christmas though what
can I copy we have it this morning
oh yeah are we getting close to the
Internet
yeah let me say we have to be which I
kind of timewise works out
I figured it was appropriate for today I
agree and we got no key he's got his
reindeer toy you got reindeer toy yeah
and I'm busy mom leave me alone I'm at
work you're at work on a Sunday yeah
yeesh so my mom when they were over you
know they got us gifts and this is one
of the ones my mom got it says a dream
is a wish your heart makes and it's a
little charm so I want to see if it fits
on my little charm bracelet I already
have it's so cute
so Tyler we didn't actually label our
gifts so I'll hope that that's open up
yeah that's the delineating line those
are the ones for you yeah well well in
your rest is not a gift for me this I
bought for you you hear much better
rapper than I am you can tell no you're
a really good rapper though but this
year it was rough I don't know I think
it's cuz it was thicker paper paper I
don't know it was harder I think the red
and green one was a little easier he got
his new little Christmas toy it's like
there's a really durable Fox like thing
he doesn't it matches you it matches you
so this was the first gift I opened and
it might be the best because I've been
wanting Ferrero Rocher for ever wanting
to try them and we've already tried them
and they're so good they taste like
Nutella because they're hazelnut they're
so good I've got laundry to put away and
Tyler is playing with his knife
sharpener over there that he just got
for Christmas hi there how's it going
and then we got me home it is so nice I
move my head before wasn't a dockable
one and so I it's a long story it was
really small and it was still good but
this is so much better and he was like I
just thought it was so you with the gold
and the way I'm like yeah that one is so
awesome oh and I wanted to show you if
you watched my um uh
first of all this is a sock from
Disneyland Paris isn't that awesome
um I in an earlier vog I was talking
about this and I know again not ever
religious but this my friend Lisa got me
and I love so if you're wanting like a
daily devotional that just always seems
to be exactly what you need that day
this one's amazing but this is that book
I bought if you watch my Black Friday
blog and I started it last night since
we leave tomorrow for our trip at least
when I'm filming this tomorrow
I wanted to have a really good book well
I started it and I'm on probably I don't
know page 30 something 22 it's amazing
it is amazing already so if you like the
20s and 30s that kind of era or you'd
like I mean this is the wife of the
author of The Great Gatsby f scott
Fitzgerald so if you like any of that
stuff you'd love it oh my gosh and it's
I was just realizing the next unit I'm
teaching my students is historical
fiction and I realize wait this is
actually historical fiction as well it's
kind of perfect so this is another thing
Tyler got me for Christmas this is the
Coco Mademoiselle perfume and it is the
best-smelling thing ever
okay so he also got me this sensor
mirror from smart or simple human watch
oh my gosh it's just a sensor just light
isn't that the coolest thing oh my gosh
and it's so much brighter than the one I
had before I'm so flippin excited so
this is also something I've been begging
for for years and it is a long chomp bag
and it's ideal because it folds up
really small it's waterproof it zips up
but it's durable and you can it's like
the perfect travel bag and we travel all
the time and so this is kind of kind of
be my standard carry-on bag and I
thought the color was so pretty too for
the longest time I wanted this like
olive colored one but they don't sell
anymore there's some similar but I am so
excited to use this for our trip so
right now I'm using my new mirror and
I'm kind of putting to the side things I
think I'm in a pack for London so I know
I wanted to bring BB cream but then also
even though this says BB it's like a
foundation so I think these are the two
I'm gonna bring for the trip just face
wise so I'm just kind of working through
my stash and figuring that out and I'm
also a little tip if you have like
Disney movie rewards or anything like
that if you're a Disney freak like I am
you can
download videos that you own offline
that way like I can have my iPad and
watch it offline with no internet at all
while we're flying so since it'll be a
long flight
I'm dive download a tingle in Aladdin
and right now I'm downloading oz the
great and powerful so just kind of
prepping for that time where I'll be
super bored we are I look like I'm
wearing like a military coup we are in
route - are you not do you not where we
going Oh Target right yeah we just
dropped off some stuff for Goodwill old
trunk pulls up we have a whole we have a
bunch of recyclables granting we're
doing that tomorrow on the way to my
parents before we go to London
woof guru its company you're insulting a
lot of people well do you want to tell
the story of why I said that it's a long
story okay it's not that long we were
playing a game and Jessica was supposed
to say and acts are we supposed to do
the accent like it was a game where it
said the accent is cockney and Jessica
was supposed to make me guess what the
accent was and she said we both know
that it's got me just straight-up
perfect accent know that now that anyway
so but we're getting a target just some
things Pinocchio needs like he needs
more food before we you know leave them
with my parents for a while and just
little like travel items and things you
know classic stuff before a trip and my
whispies are here again what else is now
one of songs your new world anyone know
that one's for work one's for not I
think the women know they'll say women
cuz like they'll say well yeah these
don't say men's they will they look like
should I assume that women are
maybe problem now I'm not gonna be
working but can I wear these if I'm not
working but what if what I'm filming do
I need to switch shoes because that's
working also look at this scarf I might
die isn't that cute I love Target I'm
torn something I don't really need it

at a McDonald's drive-through right now

this time around this happened this
temptress in my passenger seat made me
come over here well I'm just saying I
need some fuel some really bad for you

love McDonald's of course we're gonna go
