to bring you my review and thoughts on
the Too Faced natural love palette this
sucker is $59 I can't believe I spent
that much money on it
I can't believe I did it but I did and
guess what I am returning it I just got
to figure out how so I bought mine and
I'll explain why it released March 9th
I bought mine March 9th early in the
morning right before I got ready for
work got on got my credit card I was on
two-face website it's now sold on
Sephora and Ulta thank goodness because
the shipping took like two and a half
weeks
I just got it a couple days ago so you
know it is what it is sometimes stock
can be weird I'm sure they were
bombarded with orders things happen so I
don't really hold that against companies
I just know I know some people do I just
don't there are bigger problems in life
than that so I go past that but I
finally got and I was kind of right away
disappointed by the packaging the way it
had looked online maybe this was my own
brain I thought it was one of their nice
like metal packaging I knew it was
bigger because this is the size of my
face I knew it was a bigger palette but
I thought it was like their nice metal
packaging and I was like yes because I
love that packaging I think it is so
classy and strong and just good
packaging that's my opinion but it's
their kind of paper thick cardboard
packaging which you know whatever it's
magnetic but it has this look to it they
wanted this like furry feel to it but it
makes it look kind of old and worn and I
just don't like that about it again a
lot of this is totally opinion based I
mean that's the way reviews are so when
I opened it oh my oh there's a nice big
mirror very nice and I look at the
colors and I'm like oh my gosh it's just
as pretty as it looked online they have
all these beautiful deeper colors some
kind of medium ones and then some
lighter ones they have a great mix of
matte and shimmer Wow and they had a few
that have like actual glitter in it
which I don't usually use because the
glitter ends up everywhere which it does
but even so I'm like oh my gosh I can't
wait to play this so you know I'm just
watching it the night
get it and once this is amazing and they
do swatch beautifully the next morning I
get ready and I put on my NYX jumbo eye
pencil in milk
I used that almost all the time almost
every single day and I've used it with
drops or shadows PI and shadows
everything never had an issue in my life
I put that on I do a look with these
shadows I don't even remember what I
used by maybe five hours into the
workday I look in the mirror naman what
in the world and one of my co-workers
had said I looked really tired that day
I'm like okay like what if it's kind of
rude but whatever so I look in the
mirror and I'm like I do look tired
there had been like some of the I don't
remember what shade I think it was
lovebug here which is this really pretty
kind of purplish color it had gotten
everywhere and it just like it was on my
lashes things I've never experienced
before in my life
I've never had issues with this it was
just everywhere and like it had worn on
top of my eyeliner and so I did I did
look tired and kind of weird so the next
day I'm like okay I'm going to use a
different house so I use a different so
when I came back to it
I used my Urban Decay primer potion
because I thought I'll use a different
kind of primer let's see how it does
with something else so I flipped that on
again that is a foolproof shadow primer
for me I don't really have oily lids or
anything like that I put that on I start
doing another look with it I use some of
the more golden shades just in kind of a
light look that shadow was gone
by the end of my work day so I you know
I go to work at like 7:00 in the morning
I get back at I don't know 334 ish I
looked in the mirror and like it
literally looks like I'm wearing no
eyeshadow at all yet again even with
drugstore shadows I've never experienced
this so I don't know what they did
differently with this palette that they
swatch so beautifully let me show you
these swatch beautifully the shimmers
are stunning the mats are pretty good
you know it blends well when you're
applying it seemingly there's no issue
but as I tried it more and more every
single time no matter what primer I use
it no matter which shadows I use from
the palette it always looked horrible by
the end of the day either it was worn
off or if I partially worn off or it it
kind of had fallout everywhere
I mean it was the weirdest thing so you
know I'm just gonna keep it and because
just looking at it I'm like oh my gosh
it's so so pretty I mean it really is
but the quality is the weirdest thing
I've ever tried so I don't know what's
going on I'm going to show you some
toothpaste pals I love that don't do
this so if you're dying to try some
two-faced stuff stay away from this I
love their natural eye palette I've had
this for years it's got a good mix of
mattes and shimmers I of course love
their chocolate bar palette it's
beautiful its watches similarly maybe a
little bit better than the natural love
and it stays on all day I love their
semi-sweet if you like these colors what
I've always said about this palette is
cover up the blue and look at the
palette because the blue really throws
me off and it made me not want it I just
don't like the blue in there but
everything else is so beautiful and
they're sweet peach palette is pretty
good so I mean oh my gosh they smell so
good
so spend your money and it's actually
cheaper and get these these are way
better better packaging better shadows
they stay all day they blend well
they're pigments all of the stuff you're
looking for in an eyeshadow palette that
you're spending hard-earned money on so
I'm going to return this I'm sure it's
going to be a nightmare because I've
been you know returning to Sephora and
Ulta that's different but returning to
like a specific makeup brands website
can sometimes be tricky so I hope this
is helpful for you to watch I like doing
these kinds of videos whether the
product is amazing or bad because that's
my job to tell you guys you know the
real deal with it so I hope that you'll
subscribe before you leave to catch more
my reviews and demos and hauls etc and I
hope you'll come say hi on my social
media which is right up there chin
beauty 89 on all of my accounts and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye
