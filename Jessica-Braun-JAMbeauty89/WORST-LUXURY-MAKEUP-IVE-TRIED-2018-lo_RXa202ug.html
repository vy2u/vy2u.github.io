gonna share with you a bunch of high-end
luxury products that did not work for me
I really didn't like a couple of these I
bought myself a lot of them are sent to
me in PR but you guys know I'm always
honest about regardless of if it's sent
to me if I loved it hated it if it was
math whatever so I'll try to explain
really really well why I didn't like
them as we go through the video I wanted
to mention that this video is sponsored
by hellofresh
might be my new favorite obsession Tyler
and I both it came in the mail it comes
in like this insulated box so we could
you know it could sit out for a while so
finally we cut into it we were like oh
my gosh three separate meals and you can
choose between classic vegetarian or
family depending on your you know
lifestyle choices or just the way that
you eat or who you're feeding like if
you've got a family to feed and I love
it because it really is all fresh it had
everything you need it I think the only
thing I needed AB was like water it was
amazing so the first dish we tried was
something I never thought to make it was
so delicious it used so many different
fresh ingredients and I like that it's
got the recipe right there there's no
guesswork the things are already
measured a lot of the meals are one-pot
meals they're usually around 30 minutes
to make and they also have one that's
like a 20 minute quick recipe for that
one night a week that you know like oh
my gosh we have no time and I like this
because it's something that Tyler and I
can do together we can cook together if
we want you know we both like to cook
but this is something that you know it's
it's fun to do it's exciting you're
trying new recipes and you know that
you're eating some good fresh stuff each
night and that I think alone is really
exciting also we had leftovers and they
were delicious the next day too so go to
hello fresh comm and enter the code
Jessica Braun 30 and you can get 30
dollars off your first purchase okay I
don't even know where to begin let's
start with the elephant in the room this
is the newest addition to this little
area well one of it's the Marc Jacobs
shameless foundation what in the world
happened that this got released to the
world like it looked there's a reason so
many youtubers are trying it we're all
like what is going on now
I say that I know that there and I've
even seen some areas comments there are
some people out there that did like it
you must have to have a very specific
way of applying it or a certain skin
type where this would just work very
well I've tried it with a couple
different primers I've tried it with my
hands brush and sponge I don't know how
to make this work I've got pretty normal
skin it definitely tends to be a little
drier but it's not super dry so for me
it would bunch up in the weirdest places
like I was saying I had really weird
like I don't even own it it wasn't even
like crepeiness it was like it just
gathered weird and I couldn't get it to
blend out it's like it's set the way
that it was and it you couldn't change
it and it was and then throughout the
day it just got worse and worse and
worse so glad to just bad bad bad bad I
keep saying I'm gonna keep trying it
maybe I was trying to get but every time
I do I wipe it off because I'm like I
can't do it I literally cannot go to
work with this on my face it is
absolutely terrible
can't believe it is that expensive next
product is a hair product this is almost
full and that makes me really sad this
is from way haircare and it's their
memory mist it's the freaking smell it
is the smell of this stuff it's like
flames could anyone name that movie it
smells terrible I don't know what it's
supposed to smell like and whey is
really known for a really good smelling
haircare too and this stuff was bad and
I couldn't really figure out I'd spray
it in my hair in a mic I think it's hair
spray it's a memory mist says it's a
multitasking priming spray it gives heat
protection shine long-lasting memory
curls blow outs inhibit I used that as a
hair spray didn't like it it was just
icky tried to use it as maybe a little
more like oh I'll just kind of texturize
my hair with some dry shampoo didn't
like it that way
I don't really heat styling my hair much
other than just blow drying it so I mean
I guess I didn't get to try it in that
way but the smell of it alone I cannot
do it I tried it like four or five
different times
time like now I smell like this all day
and all day long I would like catch a
whiff of my hair and I would want to
vomit it was so bad and this was I
trying this before I was pregnant cuz I
know a lot of you guys may be like oh
Jessica you're pregnant
I think I was trying this but did I try
it before I was pregnant though I really
don't know maybe it was cause either way
it's not Sarah blog yet good so if you
have it and you're not pregnant in your
nose isn't crazy please let me know your
thoughts on the smell next this is from
G washi okay
they sent this to me it's their LaRouche
sculpt two-tone lipstick it's in the
shade 0-1 sculpt in rouge this is black
and red so I thought hmmm no no no what
yep it reminds me of like the black
jelly beans here but it's I don't
understand I tried it on my lips both
ways like with the black on the outside
and with the black on the inside it
looked crazy it looked crazy I don't
understand what it's for I know that
there's this trend I really like those
Laneige two-tone lipsticks but those
they have some where the colors go a
little bit better together I could not
figure this out but and so formula wise
it's definitely very creamy the kind
where it's just gonna wipe right off you
know what I mean which there's nothing
wrong with that most regular lipsticks
do that but with this two-tone idea
mixing it with the fact that it's really
really creamy I think it's just a weird
weird product next letdown was from
cargo I have this idea in my mind that I
wanted to do a cargo brand like best and
worse and try a whole bunch of their
products cuz no one really talks about
them well this was the first product I
bought in pursuit of doing this video
and then I was like you know let's go
ahead and pump the brakes I'm gonna need
to think about if I really want to
invest a bunch of money in cargo makeup
I really like their blushes and bronzers
they're fantastic they stay on all day
this was their one base concealer and
foundation in one and the idea is that
it's just a little doe foot wand and you
can apply it just to maybe certain areas
of your face
instead of putting foundation everywhere
you can just apply it in a few places
kind of blend it in and then it just you
know all together would even your skin
tone out I love that idea however I can
do that with regular foundation you know
what I mean
this I was like well maybe I'll use it
as a concealer but it really it doesn't
cover enough it just kind of blends away
and that was the problem I have you know
like a few blemishes here I cannot get
it to cover it I mean I would put on
three layers I'm like well what am i
doing now I'm just wasting this product
for no reason so I just felt like it
didn't serve any purpose and if I'm
gonna go in and put things all over my
face to cover blemishes
well then can it cover some blemishes
cuz this one sure did not this was a
weird one this is from it cosmetics it's
our superhero liner
let me see maybe it's working again nope
this oh hey let me start by saying I
freaking love the superhero mascara one
of my favorites but it is pricey so I
don't buy it all the time I have
drugstore favorites I'd rather use like
the essence lash princess mascara it's
the one with the lime green mint green
this is one of my favorites like 5 bucks
it's like I don't really want to spend
$20 on mascara when I can use and
actually I'm wearing that on my lashes
say anyway so I like the superhero
mascara this liner I think they sent to
me at some point and guys I can't get it
to like be black it you know you can
kind of swatch it and it's bit black but
when I would try to apply it you know
today I used like a powder liner so I
didn't actually use a liquid liner and I
would try to create a wing with it it
just it was like I couldn't fill in the
gaps it's weird it's like a cradle a
marker like there's just gaps in there
so I'm going over it over and over again
and then finally it'll get black of it
I'm like okay
again there are drugstore products that
are better the NYX epic ink liner I
literally bring up in every video it's
so good and it's five bucks or seven
bucks and this is I'm sure over twenty
dollars or right around there and you
have to use a ton of it to get it to
work and even then there would still be
weird areas that I like couldn't fill in
it was just odd very odd it felt like
okay let's see if this analogy makes
sense you know when you have sidewalk
chalk and you're writing
the sidewalk and you're trying to like
color and there's always like no matter
how much you color in one place there's
always parts of the cement that aren't
being colored in so you keep going and
finally it looks mostly colored in
that's how I felt with this that was a
pretty good analogy good job to us next
product is this pure get a grip I shadow
primer
expensive for an eyeshadow primer it is
so thick it's so thick you almost can't
get it out of the tube like I am
squeezing and squeezing their we go gosh
it's really thick and it's hard to
spread out and then once you do it would
collect in certain areas and create like
a line and so I try to blend that out
quickly but it's set so fast you're like
like you have no time to work with this
and I can't decide if it's because it's
so thick I don't know and I haven't used
it that much and as I'm squeezing like
it's like not even full so I think this
was a huge miss again even for the price
tag I'm like why would anyone pay that I
feel like it's similar to like the
Milani oh and you could just feel it
it's I wish you guys could feel this
it's like sticky but like you know you
have glue on your hand not like a not
even glue oh it's giving me the
heebie-jeebies like nails on a
chalkboard sorry if that freaks you out
freaks me out too I freaked myself out
another dud is this blush what oh yeah
it is the blush but it's butter LONDON
blazing blush gel a cool idea it's very
like a jelly almost like pudding
however I have tried it now for a while
I tried it a video but I told you I
realized after you guys showed me like
hey you idiot you put that over powder
of course it didn't work you guys are
right so I tried it a couple more times
and it just looks so patchy and weird on
your cheeks I can't and the color they
sent me all of them I've already got rid
of the others but this is the color
dazzle I'm getting rid of as well it
just doesn't look good
period I can't figure it out I've tried
it with the sponge with my fingers with
the brush all of it
it just looks patchy and weird and then
it sits
that area and then you look like a clown
then you have to wipe it off it's just a
it's just not a good product so this one
was really surprising to me it's the
Becca aqua luminous perfecting
foundation and so I was so excited to
own this so I'm gonna insert some
footage of me with this on my face so
you can see it okay I literally stopped
I can't do it this is the Becca aqua
luminous perfecting foundation I know I
look ridiculous I'm quite aware can you
see how it like look at that that's what
it and that's what I'm remembering it
doing I'm why I'm watching this off I
can't even do it I literally stopped so
it looks you know from it isn't well
there's some coverage where I have it
but then you look up close I cannot get
that to blend in look at that I've tried
it with the sponge a brush nope not
worth the money save your money so
obviously I don't know what in the heck
this stuff it was just weird it was just
weird
I can't figure out how people are making
this work and this was one that I had in
a foundation to clutter and I was like
let me try it one more time cuz I'm not
sure how I felt but I remember not
liking it and so what you just saw was
me trying it one more time and realizing
no way so that was this morning I
literally wiped it all off and put on
something different I couldn't do it it
looked so bad like worse than honestly
worse than the Marc Jacobs probably
clothes if you have this and it works
for you what are you doing what primary
are you using what how are you applying
it please let me know because I want to
make this work this was not cheap I have
it in the shade fair by the way if you
were curious so those were all of my
products that I really didn't like I
didn't get on with on the luxury more
expensive side of things if you like
this kind of a video I know it was very
negative let me know by giving it a
thumbs up and I hope you'll subscribe
before you leave and hit that little
notification Mel and I'll see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
