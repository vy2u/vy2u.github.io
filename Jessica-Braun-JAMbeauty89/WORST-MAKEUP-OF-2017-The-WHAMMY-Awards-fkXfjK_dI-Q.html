my oh what am I gonna call it my way
Me's or my shammies to rhyme with
jammies which is my best of 2017 these
are my worst of 2017 these are products
that I've tried this year that I was
really really disappointed in for one
reason or another if you like this kind
of a video I hope you'll give it a
thumbs up and I hope you'll subscribe as
well let's go and get into it I'm out of
breath already
we got trouble my friends first product
oh where do I even begin
let's start with the one that I think I
was the most disappointed in and this
was so pretty recent to me but I felt so
strongly about it I wanted to mention it
this is the Tarte clean slate timeless
smoothing primer a lot of people love
this primer I don't get it I can't get
it to work my skin looks terrible with
this on no matter what foundation it
could be my absolute favorite foundation
ever that I'm putting on top of it it
looks terrible I'm just flabbergasted so
you know it's a very you know it's that
very filling like a pore filling
smoothing primer and you can even see
like when I'm putting on my hand I mean
you can't see it really does smooth the
area that's crazy but I feel like no
matter what I put on top of it and I
usually only use it in my nose region I
don't need it everywhere you know but
definitely to fill in pores and smooth
this area here and sometimes I'll put it
there although I stopped putting it
there because it made it look so much
worse but even still like I typically
have a very red nose and so I can't with
this stuff on I can't get the foundation
to stay on it it's weird and I feel like
I've tried it with so many foundations
at this point that I'm like forget it
I'm done I'm waving the white flag I
surrender I just don't think I like it
so it was a pretty penny and I think the
packaging is pretty and if you like this
that is so awesome I really wish I did I
feel like I want to continue trying it
maybe I don't know if you have any
secrets to how you use this let me know
because I do want to like this I very
very recently bought it and I really
that it's not working for me alrighty
next product this is a drugstore one
that was super disappointing
it's the Revlon Colorstay eyeshadow
primer this was newer at the drugstore
this year and you take it off and it's
just a squeezy tube it comes out like
it's kind of a nude colored guys this
does not do anything it does not do
anything it just wipes away it's very
oily for an eyeshadow primer I've never
tried one that says like oily as this is
very odd doesn't hold on the shadow it
doesn't cancel anything out it's it's
just bad like I don't know how this got
through testing honestly probably one of
the most comically bad eye shadow
primers I've ever if not the most bad
that can't be the right but you guys
know what I mean it was bad
don't just avoid avoid avoid avoid
frankly I've not heard a lot about this
I wanted to try it because I hadn't
heard a lot about it but um I think I
see why I have not heard a lot on it it
was terrible
alright this is one that so many people
love so I definitely have an unpopular
opinion about this these are the milk
makeup lipsticks her lip colors these
were they sent me every shade of their
line and I was ready to love them and I
did not this is the shade cream I just
feel like these are hard - they're not
creamy like of course I'm likes watching
a ton of it I don't know how to get it
across like like that was one swatch let
me see if I can just like do a swatch I
feel like I don't know like it's just
not it's not the kind of a lipstick
formula I like maybe that's what it is
so if you like a kind of drier lipstick
formula I'm getting a makeup wipe out um
it's not like crazy dry but I just don't
like it like I felt like I was like
pulling on my lips to get the color to
show up and I have the blessing or curse
of very pigmented natural lips a
blessing in that I think it can look
nice but like at other times like me and
like I want this color to look the way
it looks when I swatch it and it doesn't
because my lips are too pigmented um but
for me like I felt like I couldn't cover
my own lips the right way with some of
these
this is another shade I have called
wifey again I just feel like it feels
like a crayon like I'm just going back
and forth with a rose art crayon you
know what I mean by rose art sorry rose
art the Crayola is better and we all
know it anyway I've ever told you guys
the story about how I wrote a letter to
rose art as a kid I think I had I told
my students all how I told my students
this year the story about rose art I
feel like I have although we're teaching
and writing persuasive next maybe I'll
tell it then anyway so when I was a kid
my parents had bought rose art crayons
and I'm using them in a way oh this is
garbage you don't look like six I'm like
this is garbage just like it's just it's
not nearly as smooth it's really waxy so
it's skip parts when you're coloring and
I loved to color I still do and so I was
complaining to my parents and they were
like why don't you write a letter to it
I'm like I will maybe I wasn't six
that's probably eight or nine so I wrote
a very well-written letter to rose art
requesting that they need to improve
their formula and why and what I thought
was bad about so they wrote me a letter
back and they sent me a brand new box of
rose our crayons and on the Korean box
it said new and improved formula and I'm
like oh my gosh like I changed things I
did it now to this day of course I don't
know that I really did it and also I
don't remember like using the crayons
like were they any better I don't think
they were but it was still kind of cool
like it was just one of those cool life
experiences as a kid Wow
sorry about that tangent didn't really
like these milk makeup lip colors
alright so next product that I was like
ooh was from Physicians Formula this is
their killer curves mascara I thought I
would like it like looking at the
applicator it looks like the lash
paradise that I love so I'm like oh it's
gonna be so good no it ended up giving
me like four eyelashes all clumped
together and then they like dried and
I'm like oh and so like literally I
looked like a cartoon character with
four eyelashes it was terrible terrible
I don't even want to use it again like I
used it that first time and I was like
oh my gosh so I wait
a few weeks like maybe it just needs
some time use it again same thing and I
literally like with eye makeup remover
just kind of removed it sounds like it's
so bad so I'm like I don't wanna do this
again I don't want to waste another look
you know what I mean and ruin another
look with it it was very bad I did not
like it at all
um so not only did not add volume but it
also didn't separate it didn't add light
like it didn't do anything I want a
mascara to see who ok the next product
oh my gosh it's the Becca under eye
brightening corrector now they do have
like a complete concealing cream or
something like that I feel like it's got
completing the title that a lot of
people love I have not tried that but
this was their under-eye brightening
corrector and I thought oh my gosh it'll
be like really nice and like it'll
really cancel out dark circles cuz it's
got that nice apricot tone this stuff is
so amoliant and creamy and moisturizing
then I can't get it to stay in place
like at all so if I put it on and blend
it with my finger it blends away that's
probably the best way to apply it but
even then so I'm try it with a brush no
sponge no it just soaks it right on up I
can't get it to look good on my under
eye and it's a shame because you know
like if you've got dry under eyes like
me I'm like oh it's so moisturizing and
brightening but I can't get it to stay
in place for the life of me no matter
what I do and I'm like please I keep
trying it alike please I just want you
to work and I just can't get it to work
so it's really disheartening cuz I
really think it appears gorgeous I even
like the packaging but I can't get it to
work I'm so disappointed another is from
Ulta beauty this is their HD soft focus
liquid foundation I know a couple of
youtubers have liked this it looked so
bad on my dry skin it looks so bad now
this is a little too yellow to me this
is for me this is light warm it just it
covered okay it didn't cover everything
minute card okay but it just enhanced
everything on any bad thing I had going
on with my skin it enhanced and I just
felt like throughout the day as I wore
it I was like like every lighting I was
in I'm like oh my skin just doesn't look
good like it just did not look good
and I tried so many foundations that are
the same price point it's not cheaper
that I absolutely love and that don't do
so I'm like I don't have time for this
then if this is around 10 to 15 dollars
I've get something that are $8 $9 $6
that are so much better and if you are
curious about which ones I just did my
best of the year for drugstore in high
end like I was saying and I have like
three drugstore foundations that I
absolutely swear by so definitely check
that out if you're like okay then what
should I use so those were all the
products that kind of stood out to me
this was hard to do because I've
decluttered a lot that I didn't like
over the year you know especially after
we moved into our house in the summer so
I didn't want to bring over a ton of
makeup that I didn't like I didn't want
to move that stuff so I feel like I'd
gotten rid of a lot of the things that I
didn't like so a lot of these I feel
like are a little more recent but some
of them I've had for a while and I've
just been disappointed for a while as
well so if you enjoyed this kind of a
video definitely give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you would like to and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
