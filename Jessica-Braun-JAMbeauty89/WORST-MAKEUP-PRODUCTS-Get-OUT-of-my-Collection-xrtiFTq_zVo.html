got a whole bag I mean the most I've
ever had a product I just don't like
makeup I didn't like for one reason or
another obviously we have are all we all
slow down just obviously we all have our
own opinions if one of these works for
you please let us know below so that if
someone else has some somewhat different
skin or a different tone or different
needs than me they can read your guys's
comments and maybe see oh actually this
would work for me it just didn't work
for Jessica so I've got some really
really expensive products in here and
some really really cheap products in
here I hope that you'll stick around and
subscribe catch more of my videos I
found out quite a few makeup
I don't like videos I will link my most
recent one below if you want to see some
more other than that these are all
products that I decluttered from my
collection very recently all right first
one the Too Faced peanut butter and
honey palette this they sent to me and I
would say about half the products are
sent to me half of them I bought you
guys know that it doesn't matter if they
were sent to me I will always be honest
whether I liked them or hated them so
this is one that I just don't get like I
feel like there it's not that it's bad
quality the quality is fine and I
actually like to face shadows a lot but
other I would wear the peanut butter
shade maybe feeling nutty but like the
light pink I'm never going to wear the
kind of gold glitter orange like the
glitter just falls everywhere what why
why so for me as a yellow I wouldn't
wear again this is totally my opinion
but I just feel like it's a palette that
not many people would need unless you
look at all nine of these shadows and
things I would totally use all those
it's not worth the price tag I was like
almost $40 so for me this was a pass but
it does smell it all what to face
shadows always smell pretty good next
product is this model's own fake face
this is literally Glary I mentioned this
in my may favorites and failed I like
the consistency of it and models own
they've had some good products I've
liked and some that I've hated this is
just one that I hate it it literally
made every foundation I put on top of it
look like I just look like a greaseball
and I'm not I don't have greasy skin I
have normal to dry so I'm like what is
going to look let's keep going so this
one might be a shocker to many this is
the it cosmetics CC cream but it's
illuminating version I don't understand
this because I have tried it alone and
it is way too illuminating to put all of
your face like I swear to you for anyone
it's way too literally shimmery and it
makes me so sad because I love the it
cosmetics CC cream just the regular one
but this one literally makes you look
like so shimmery and I'm like trying to
see if there's like glitter in it now
then I can't see it but every time I put
it on my skin it I will mix it with my
regular one and it's still way too much
so and I'm all for a glue gluing nope
dewy glowy skin and this is just a pass
and I'm really sad because this is a
giant one they sent me but I can't do it
okay so the next product is from
Physicians Formula they recently sent me
these and I was so excited to try them
it's their mineral wear cushion
corrector and primer do they have yellow
and green and they have peach and
lavender the idea is that when you open
them it's a cushion like the foundation
so the packaging couldn't be cuter but
you have one thought one color for each
side of this and then when you open it
you could get whichever side the thing
is these don't stay in place so like I
use the green on my nose because my
green my nose is always green what am I
saying
have I not had enough coffee or have I
had too much coffee it was in my mind I
would put the green on my nose because
my nose is always red and I would set it
down and kind of leave it and then it
would just look kind of weird so I tap
it with my finger it would just not stay
in place and then I'm like wha just
added a layer of like weirdness and it
didn't do anything so why even put it on
at all and so I tried a couple more the
other ones and I just didn't feel like
it did enough to make it worth that
extra step and the extra price of just
buying me so cute idea really really
adorable packaging but absolutely
useless to me
alright I have two from essence this is
the essence camouflage cream concealer
this is just really dry like trying to
get it going it's like kind of dry and
then once you do get it going it just it
doesn't blend well it's I don't know
like it didn't stay on like I had a
that I tried it on and it did not stay
it was just it made it look worse and
creepy and old and weird and I just
didn't like it and it was really
inexpensive so you know you kind of
gamble there sometimes a really
inexpensive product can just blow you
away other times it is terrible and this
is one that just do not work saying for
this essence one this is there say no to
redness I thought we will put it on my
nose no it's it's a cream stick you can
see it's very green but it just it just
didn't do anything like it was too green
and then when I blended it just kind of
blended away and again when I put
something on top of it it just looked
kind of weird so I don't know again
another cheap product that really was
cheap for a reason I guess ok next
product is this NYX honey do me up I
hated this if you saw to get ready with
me haul type video where I was trying it
I ended up taking it off it's like this
goopy kind of you know honey-like
consistency thinner than that and how
does these you know fake little gold
flakes in it and the idea is that you
could use it as a primer as skin care
however you want to use it really but it
says honey is a natural antiseptic gold
flakes increase skin radiance collagen
for smoother skin well it just made my
skin look weird and goopy my skin didn't
like it like it kind of I don't remember
if it like actually stung or it just
like my skin you could tell I don't know
if you know what I mean but you almost
can tell that your skin doesn't like it
it's like huh so I know that when I did
that video has a very strong kind of
antiseptic like smell it doesn't really
smell like honey it just smells like
chemicals think it just depends on your
skin because I know some people in that
video you commented that oh I actually
really liked it so you know if you know
this sounds like you might like it you
might want to give it a try but for me I
just didn't like it I don't want to use
it anymore on my skin next one is this
Maybelline Dream velvet so I recently
did my foundation collection where I
went through every drugstore foundation
I all I think there are like 16 of them
and talked about the pros and cons of
every single one how many shades they
have the price point and which I would
recommend which I wouldn't well this is
one that I was kind of on the fence
about and I the shade is all wrong for
me its shade 20 and it's like
really orange but I said in the video
I'm like you know I kinda I don't really
know how I feel about this I kind of
want to get another shade to try it out
and so many of you an overwhelming
amount said don't buy another shade it
is terrible it's not worth it you can
hear it inside like the whole gloop of
mousse is just shaking around all in one
piece which I just think is weird it's
not that big of a deal it's not but to
me it freaked me out
and it's this wrist mousse Foundation
which I totally would get down with but
what I remembered when I tried it and I
tried it again is that it just kind of
spread around and then eventually just
looked really weird on your skin it
never really blends in
it has weird covers kind of spotty
coverage and so it was one of those that
I'm really glad you guys said that
because once I tried it one more time I
was like they're right I don't like this
formula I think if you're wanting
something super high coverage from the
drugstore I would get the L'Oreal
infallible total cover its got more
cover to this a way better consistency
it's just it's pretty good and it's got
a similar consistency next product this
is an expensive one this is from
Giovanni it's their nude so they're
shimmering nudes palette I got this for
free from octiline and you know there I
love oculi too they're really big on you
know be honest if you got it you don't
like it that's fine you know you're
supposed to give your honest opinion and
I love that but this was just for the
price of I think it was like 60 or maybe
even more than $60 for the palette it
should kind of crummy like literally
look at these swatches it's just kind of
it's weird like there's this white
shimmer that doesn't really do anything
literally I was so excited when I got
this in the mail and then when I opened
it like oh it's really pretty I like the
combo of colors and then when I tried it
I was like you've got to be good until I
go away so this is a happy goodbye the
next product is this elf foundation
serum it's a really thin consistency and
when I put it on my skin again I did
this in a video I ended up taking it off
just because it rubbed all around and
never seemed to
and in and it made my skin look worse
than it was what with nothing on you
know what I mean now this is not meant
to be a high coverage foundation it's
not meant to do that at all but for me
like I've got plenty of tinted
moisturizers and like the glossier skin
perfecting tint all of those are very
similar to this and yet I felt like it
covered more blended in well and this
just didn't do that there are L
foundations I love I love their flawless
finish foundation this I did not again
this is one of those that a lot of you
guys do like you told me so if you've
got really great skin or you I don't
know I feel like my skin's not too bad
like I'll go out of the house without
foundation and sup on just because I you
know it's okay but even this still I
didn't like it alright so this next one
was from this this next one from model
zone I talked about it in that video
it's their color chrome palette it's
these cream eyeshadows the packaging is
so cool it's these cream eyeshadows that
are just crummy they remind me if you
remember those like um some of them are
okay but if you remember like those was
it Revlon that had those little cream
showers it was like you could buy a pack
of four and it was like these little
circular cream shadows and they were
really thin now very pigmented then like
color touches came out and things got
really really good but before all of
those cream shadows it was like those
and I would if I can find it I will put
it on the screen what I mean because I
know some of you guys will remember
these very well it reminds me of those
not in a good way
kind of nostalgic but if you look at the
swatch as you can see there alright but
this was a mere twenty dollar palette
and I just don't think for that price
point that you should have that quality
I feel like it should be a step above
that now I do feel like having exposed
cream shadows like this it would be very
difficult like if it was more like a
color tattoo those try out so quickly
even when they're lit the way they are
so I can only imagine putting a formula
like that and something like this it
wouldn't last very well so I'm sure
that's why it is a different kind of a
formula but it's just not one it just
didn't do anything on my eyes just kind
of rubbed around and then was kind of
nothing it was just a light wash of
color
speaking of whitewash your color these
are the 24 karat
I did a whole video on this I can write
below I did not like this palette I was
so disappointed because the colors are
so pretty
it was just crummy all of the colors
there was one really good color this
goal the goal was so beautiful but like
everything else was so so disappointing
like just patchy and frankly it looks
like the Givenchy shadow so I guess in
that respect I don't know but just not
great and I was really fact if I had
such high hopes the next eyeshadow
palette is this one from pure cosmetics
not P you are but P you re different
wrist serve off collection I had kept
this because I was so excited to be like
The Naked 3 and I didn't own the Naked 3
at the time I do own it now I and
honestly i swatched it and I thought oh
it's really pretty and it is I mean it
caged up a lot of powder but it was
still like really pretty town and even
in the swatches I thought they swatch
pretty well and I was dead girl but then
like the price is still really high it
was like still $50 and I think I got it
like a boxycharm so I thought perfect
I'll keep it I don't need the Naked 3
well when I finally started to try to
create looks with it
I couldn't create any looks like I would
put it on even no matter how pigmented
it was I put it on the lid and start to
blend and it would just blend away and I
remember like looking at myself in the
mirror and thinking what like how where
did that go and so I would try a
different color or I try my finger
instead of a brush no matter how I did
it it would just end up lending away all
of the colors and so bizarre I've never
tried anything like this so I'm kind of
happy to get rid of it open up some
space for some other palettes in my
collection but yes next one this hard
candy glamoflauge I also mentioned in my
may favorites and fails it's these
radiant drops and no matter how much you
shake it it doesn't mix up it's
disgusting it looks like I'm sorry it
looks like vomit in there that's what it
looks like and I love hard candy but
this is gross so I can't make it work I
don't know and I'm not even a risk
buying it again because I know a lot of
you guys have said you had the same
problem not worth it this is this real
her brand I got from a boxycharm it's
their liquid lipstick matte liquid
lipstick in lady love this looked
horrible on my list I put it on it looks
like a pretty color it did dry down way
darker which was
fine it looked horrible like even my
husband who usually doesn't notice stuff
like that was like your lips look kind
of weird I'm like oh my gosh and we were
like out with friends and I'm like and I
can't take it off thank you anyway
it was terrible stay far far away that's
all of it a thing it would be worse
liquid lipstick I've ever used lastly
something that just didn't do anything
this is the Maybelline brightening
creamy concealer I was so excited like
oh my gosh that sounds awesome no it's
just if you try to use it on your under
eye no it looks so dry so if you try to
use it on the blemish which is I feel
like the best way to use it it just
doesn't cover it because you put it on
and then when you start to blend around
it it's gone I mean it's just I don't
have a place for this in my collection
so I'm glad to get rid of it it just
doesn't do anything for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
