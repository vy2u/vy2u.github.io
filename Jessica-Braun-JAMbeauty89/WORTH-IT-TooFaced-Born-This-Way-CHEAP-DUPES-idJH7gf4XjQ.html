going to be reviewing the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation now this is a really
pricey foundation in my opinion it's $39
at Ulta Sephora wherever you're going to
buy it and that's expensive for a
foundation that you're going to run out
of so I wanted to show you guys what it
looks like when I apply it to my face
I'm wearing it today and then afterwards
we'll talk about kind of whether or not
I think it's worth the price tag okay so
the packaging has a pump which of course
I really like and you can actually
control how much comes out which is
really really nice so I'm gonna get
about a pumps worth and I'm just going
to kind of dot it everywhere I'm not
using a primer I don't usually just
because for these I mean well I don't
really use the look use a primer anyway
but a lot of people don't wear a primer
look awesome so I didn't want that to
kind of sway my opinion of this
foundation whether or not I used a
primer what primer I actually use things
like that so I'm going to use the Real
Techniques Beauty well they call it a
beauty sponge which I have fallen in
love with and I'm usually obsessed with
the Beauty Blender but this one is
really really nice and I'm just going to
use the really broad side of it and I'm
just going to start in the middle and
just kind of push it into my skin and
this foundation I really like it so far
it makes my skin which I've got a pretty
normal skin it can look oily in the
summer and I can look dry in the winter
so it's kind of combo depending on the
area of my face but it just seems to
suit my skin type really well because it
doesn't make your skin look too matte
but it also doesn't make it look too dry
it's right in between so it makes my
skin look really kind of satiny in a way
I think this would be an awesome
foundation
the wintertime because it's not because
it's not drying I think in the summer
for this to work for me which I've been
wearing at this summer you have to set
it with the powder like in my tees and
you can already kind of see but I really
like that look to it and once I've got
some you know concealer on and of course
the rest of my makeup looks even better
but I really like the way that this
looks now I usually have like a lot of
freckles coming through but it's not
coming through it's bad but my nose is
like always red so I'm going to grab
what was left on the little pump there
and just put a little bit more of my
nose and just press that in and that's
pretty much it I like using the Beauty
Blender for this I've used it with my
hands and it actually looks really nice
too with a brush it looks fine but I
just I just really like this Real
Techniques Beauty Blender and they're
like 10 bucks or so somewhere around
there at Ulta and at the drugstore
wherever and they are amazing so if you
have been waiting because you're not
sure about the Beauty Blender or
whatever get this one it's amazing
so I did notice it's been about an hour
and I'm kind of continuing to get ready
while getting some laundry and things
done and it really is pretty oily so I'm
going to set my t-zone I'm just using
the Rimmel stay matte powder and
translucent
just a little bit to see if it helps
with it like I said I'm not done I have
it like contoured or blushed or anything
but it already is looking better I'm
actually going to be using something to
cover this area so I don't want to do
anything to that so it doesn't mess with
the demo but I did want I mean I was
like an oil slick so now I feel like I
should rescind my thing about it being
OK in the summer because it really like
I said you do have to set it but that
was more oily than I had remembered so
as I'm getting to know this product I'm
kind of learning a little bit more about
my own skin with this so you do have to
set so as you saw it does have very nice
coverage and the claims behind this
foundation or that it has medium to full
coverage and that it's supposed to have
a radiant finish and I would agree with
both of those claims I would definitely
say as a radiant finish if not too
radiant and I think that if you have
oily skin I don't think you would love
this foundation even I don't really have
oily skin like true
the oily skin and yet I still after
setting it with powder it still is
shining through now I don't mind that
this amount of shine but people that do
mind not war if you have oily or skin
than I do
I don't think you'll like this now if
you've got dry skin I think you would
love this foundation it adds that dewy
radiance that you're probably looking
for unless you like a really matte
finish the packaging of course is
beautiful as two-faced packaging always
is and I love the pump and how it's
actually controllable where you can get
a little bit out or a lot of it out you
can actually control how much foundation
comes out when you pump it Pump It Wow
pump it louder they have the shade ring
to this they only have 12 shades and
just looking at it it doesn't go as deep
as it should it really I mean it stops
it like a kind of caramel e color so
it's literally called caramel so I do
think the shade range is something they
would need to fix this didn't have a
noticeable smell to me and all some
foundations really have smells that you
notice I didn't notice the smell at all
so if you're really sensitive I think
this would be a good option for you if
you're sensitive to a lot of the smells
it doesn't feel tacky and it never
really felt tacky putting it on it's
kind of the perfect line between thin
and thick it's like right in the middle
and so it's just easy to apply whether
it's with a brush or a beauty blender or
your hands really easy to apply
it doesn't feel sticky it's just it's a
really really nice formula the wear time
on this depends on your skin because I'm
right in between oily and dry just kind
of combo and it does it doesn't
necessarily break up but it just looks
so early about five hours into the day
in the summer time so I do have to
continually touch it up so I don't think
this is going to be my number one option
for the summer like I'd mentioned but
for the winter this might be my favorite
because I'm so dry in the winter and
this actually might make my skin look
semi alive because I look just like gray
and terrible in the winter time so I'm
really excited to try this out when my
skin starts to dry out a little bit so
coupons for Too Faced I would say this
is something that whenever like Sephora
does they're 20% off deals that you can
actually use and Ulta sometimes
have there 20% off thing but sometimes
they'll have one like I feel like it's
once a year where you can actually use
it on high-end products I would say wait
if you're not sure about this but you're
pretty sure maybe wait until one of
those times of the year so you can get
20% off of like essentially $40 is what
eight bucks off so that's still a nice
cut into it otherwise $40 it's just a
lot for this so I pulled out a few
drugstore options in case you're wanting
a similar finish to this this reminds me
of the covergirl what is it called stay
luminous foundation it's new at the
drugstore it's got that same luminous
finish but it also has some coverage I
think that the Too Faced one has more
coverage than this but it's still pretty
good and you could just layer on maybe
an extra layer to get the similar effect
but it has the same thing where if
you're oily I would stay away but if
you're not and you want something this
is a great option it also has a pump and
it's way cheaper
I also really like my Rimmel lasting
finish foundation now this one is not as
oily so I think if you do have oily skin
and you want kind of a similar
foundation but not as luminous this is a
great option this will give you like a
satin finish and it is my favorite
favorite favorite I love this foundation
so much and it's like under $10 at the
drugstore as well so overall what I
recommend it I think you know my
feelings on it I would recommend it if
you have the right skin tight and you've
got the budget if not go from one of the
drugstore options they're just as good
I'll continue to use all three of those
but those are kind of my two cents on it
