haul of Walmart brand products plus else
so I have some hard candy products some
flower beauty products and then I also
have just some elf products but I also
bought at Walmart but I wanted to throw
into this haul because I don't think it
was enough for like its own alcohol but
it's still some really exciting new
stuff that I've never heard about never
try and I'm really excited I hope that
you will subscribe while you are here
and tap that Bell so you are notified
when any new videos come up on my
channel so let's go and get into it
let's start with the elf stuff because I
actually had one of these products like
on my list of things I wanted to buy
that I used to have a long time ago and
this is their elf daily brush cleanser I
used to be so good about like as I'm
using my brushes kind of just spot
cleaning them I would spray them kind of
wipe it off on like a washcloth like a
clean washcloth in front of me but I got
out of that habit and I do feel like my
brushes are kind of suffering because
while I wish I could wash them every
week it just doesn't happen and if
you're a normal human like me does that
happen right so i'm i used to do like um
alcohol what's that call you don't mean
that you could I just put it in like a
Dollar Tree bottle and spray it but I
think the daily brush cleanser from
elves just a little bit more gentle not
that there's anything wrong with using
alcohol there's not it cleaning it kills
germs it's great but I really like this
I liked it it's just a little bottle as
well so then I can just take a brush
that is semi dirty and while this is not
taking the place of cleaning your
brushes
not even by longshot but I can just
spray the brush wipe it off and then let
it just kind of air dry in the brush cup
that I have and I just feel like it's a
little bit cleaner the next time I use
it so I'm excited to have this in my
collection again because I really did
love this and they've had that out for a
long time elf came out with this aqua
beauty and I loved most of the products
in our aqua Beauty line but it's their
primer mist and it says this water-based
primer mist
prep skin for smooth makeup application
and a radiant look enriched with
purified water to cumber vitamin C D and
leave skin looking dewy and fresh so it
says hold of eight to ten inches from
your face right evenly on skin use prior
to makeup application to help prime skin
or after makeup application to set your
makeup or throughout the day to refresh
so curious how the nozzle is that's the
thing that can make her
break a product like this like how is
the nozzle what the packaging is really
beautiful they're really like amping up
their game so I'm going to shake it up
assuming I need to shake it up it should
see this is really pretty packaging
feels very high-end so it's very
actually really even spray I don't
really notice the smell so I'm excited
to use it I love when there are cheaper
versions Oh crazy expensive products
like I think of my primer spray from
Scandinavia I love that stuff but it's
been more expensive and I would much
rather save the money if it's pretty
close to the same thing so I will let
you guys know I'm kind of planning an
elf best and worst video for maybe a few
weeks from now or a month from now once
I'm done teaching for the year when I
have time I would love to really get a
roundup of everything I own from elf and
what I loved what I didn't and what's
kind of met and just walk you through
everything let me know if you'd be
interested all right they also have this
beautifully beautifully bear liquid
highlighter with vitamin E and it's in
there illuminating shade and I saw
Nicole from young wild and polish who I
love I saw her on her snapchat
I think elf maybe had sent her this or
something or maybe she bought it but she
was comparing it to the coconut gel
highlighter from Marc Jacobs and it
really is close it really is and I'm
kind of planning a dupes video as well
and that one might be this might be
pretty result it's a little bit thinner
I think of a formula all oily feeling in
a way but I think they said that it's
oil free
oh no it's oil-based sorry literally the
opposite of oil free oil based liquid
highlighter with illuminating pigments
that brings light to the face for a
glowing dewy complexion so the way I
apply products like this is I'll usually
spread it out of my hand like this and
I'll either grab like a Beauty Blender
type product where you can just dip it
in and kind of put it where you want or
I'll grab like a stipple brush elf
actually sells great simple brushes I'll
sip lit into it and just stipple it onto
my cheek you can also just use your
finger and tap it on but I like products
like this I think it takes a while to
get used to using them but they can look
so beautiful I love times instead of
putting blush and bronzer on my face
once I've done foundation I'll just take
a pretty highlighter like this
have it on and that's all I do for my
face I'll told you my eyes but I notice
it just makes me look a little bit
younger just fresher and like I'm not
trying as hard as I am which I like
about that so I'm excited to give that a
try next I picked up two of their
beautifully bare smooth matte eyeshadows
I pick I pick that soft beige and
blushing Rose I'm just intrigued by this
I have some of they're like shimmery
ones that are they're aqua lines and I
just wasn't super impressed with those I
really wasn't so I mean I'm hoping these
are better
these are matte however not shimmery
they're super creamy almost oily it says
create a flawless natural look with this
lightweight liquid matte shadow silky
smooth formula defines and contours the
eyes for long wear that has vitamin E to
nourish and hydrate yeah so eventually
it does dry down it says you got to
blend it before it dries down but it
definitely has some good pigment to it
this is a you can kind of see through it
but not too badly
this one's soft beige here and I'm
excited to see it dry and I'll have to
let you know about the wear time it is
really easy to apply with that doe foot
applicator evenly which I like even if
it went like one part of it went on and
a gloss but it spread right Allen so
that was good and this one's in blushing
Rose this one I was just intrigued you
kind of look like a deeper mauve color
I'm not sure how this would apply like
if you were trying to put this in your
crease that would be I think a little
difficult but if you want it on your lid
and then blend it up into the crease
that would probably work or just on the
lid but I can't foresee this being easy
to do just in the crease unless you were
like maybe you do a line with the doe
foot applicator and then blended it
really quickly I don't know the first
layer is not opaque so I do think you
need to do at least two layers of these
which is not the biggest deal in the
world
I think these colors are kind of unique
for eye colors so I'm excited to give
them a try I'm not on a percent sure
that I love that formula to be even just
from swatching it but I'll let you guys
know so the last elf product I bought is
their beautifully bare sheer tint
finishing powder and I got it in the
shade light/medium and I think I felt
someone else using this sounds like what
there's got a finishing powder there
Noble I would feel like left out when I
don't know about
from alphas I'm so obsessed and so many
of you guys found me through my elf
videos so it's like a it's a stronghold
for me and that it just always will be
kind of my original prankster but when
you it's a chrome packaging which you
know isn't asking your press Earl where
I think oh that's way too dark it just
won't work for me it'd be probably
beautiful on someone but this is white
Miam I didn't see a lighter God maybe
they did have one and it was just sold
out since I bought it in store so I'll
have to look online but I could use that
actually as a really light bronzer but I
have to say formula wise that was really
smooth like that just went on like
butter so out of all the elf products I
bought I mean today I think that formula
wise is very impressive straight off the
bat also when you open it so it's really
buttery and then it does have like a
sponge type applicator on the bottom if
you needed that because it does have
looks like it would have some decent
coverage so I'm going to have to get my
actual shade in this because that was
pretty cool alright so moving on let's
talk about some hard candy so I already
love a lot of hard candy products some
things I bought some things they sent
these are all ones I went and bought
myself just because I was intrigued by
them so this first one is their
glamoflage mix and pigment makeup drops
and these seem awfully similar to the
cover FX drops and they're bunch of
companies now that make things like that
but i think yeah i got number fair one
and let's just see got a little dropper
I mean yeah it's zoom Joe voice
everywhere very thin consistency that's
the way these kinds of products are the
idea is that of course you can mix them
and do maybe if you got a foundation
that's too dark for you you use a
lighter pigment if you got one too light
for you you use a darker pigment so it's
kind of nice to have a couple of options
and that is why I think having a cheaper
version like the hard candy one and not
like the really expensive coverfx ones
they're very similar and for that reason
I feel like it'd be it makes the most
sense to do the hard candy ones because
you could get a darker shade and a
lighter shade and be able to do lighter
or darker because for me I'm not always
getting one that's too dark accidentally
or always getting on the too light it's
always a mix because a lot of
I'll buy it online and so it's not exact
so if you're wanting to get more than
one once and make yours liar and want to
get darker I would say spend your money
on the cheaper ones because they do the
same thing I mean that is exactly the
same consistency I'm really excited to
have these now I got the lighter one now
I'm thinking I should have gotten the
darker a darker I should have gotten a
darker one because I already have a
lighter one of the cover effects but
awesome I'm excited to try this out a
little bit more and let you guys know
how I feel
speaking of pigment kind of mix and
drops I also got there was it called
glamoflage mix and drops in radiance
they put these in a little tube which I
was thankful for cuz the ones that were
not were a mess people had been opening
them ripping them open I found one that
was still wrapped so these ones are in
radiant and so you can add this to your
foundation if you wanted to make it a
little more luminous I bet you could use
this as a targeted highlight now I
haven't tried do these mix them away
more than that I haven't tried to cover
FX versions of these but I have tried
other brands like I think Elgin has had
some and I really like them I'll put a
couple drops on my hand just the same
way as I do the like I mentioned the elf
one and then I'll just kind of stipple
it onto my face and it can look so
beautiful
umm I have been mixing it for as long as
you have seen me doing it and it's like
this weird not really shimmery it's kind
of like see-through is that the way it's
supposed to be because it literally came
out like water and I feel like I've been
shaking this like a full minute how long
do you have to shake it I've been
sitting on the shelf for too long and
that's a problem yeah it is not what I
thought it was a little bit better this
maybe this is the way it's supposed to
be I don't know it is not at all what I
envisioned
but maybe I'll try mixing it with a
mattifying foundation to see if it does
add just a little bit of glimmer to it
all right
I also picked up their iridescent pearl
highlighter it's in it's their prismatic
highlighter and I thought hmm that
sounds awfully similar to the backup
prismatic highlighter it kind of looks
more like a white but it does look like
it's got a little bit of a lilac really
powdery so it's very powdery and gritty
but once you actually blend it out
actually is it
really pretty purple tone highlight but
definitely not a super smooth powder by
any means I mean this is going to get
everywhere so it makes me a little
nervous to use it this is a great
example of sometimes it's worth your
money to buy and more expensive product
because this really it stinks because
the after effect is beautiful but you're
going to get this all over your face
this is more powdery and just like
gritty I feel like it's been years since
i've swatched a product that's this
gritty and powdery not finely milled at
all I just chunky it's not great I would
say save your money straight off the
back the last hard candy product before
I get to the flower beauty is a product
I do know I already love from them it's
their velvet mousse matte lip color so
it's been a cute 10 depending on the
color it's in the tin is different and
you open it up and it's in there
this is they sent me the other two that
I have and I really liked them but I
wanted to get a red one because I like
this formula to get a blade to get this
out of here so it's just a really thin
it reminds me of the Urban Decay
packaging for their lip glosses that
they recently redid so I really like the
packaging this is in the shade tulip and
it looks like yes the very moosie
formula I love this kind of a formula
it's so much more comfortable super
pigmented I feel like this is a
beautiful color for spring so I was
really excited to own this one because
the other ones I have are just a little
bit more neutral so love it I just think
these are a beautiful formula beautiful
after-effects and they are comfortable
to wear as well alright my last five
products are from flower beauty so the
first one I picked out was one that it
had a signed by it that said it's like
flower beauty set seller and it is their
miracle matte translucent finishing
powder and it's quite a to-do their
packaging is absolutely stunning super
big but it says that minimizes
imperfections and it's mattifying since
it's a miracle worker our miracle matte
translucent finishing powder is the
ultimate finishing touch to your makeup
they do not test on animals so seriously
the packaging really is beautiful it's
got like this matte senate mattified
finish up here I mean the beautiful gold
flower Beauty logo
so you open it and you've got a little
powder puff there and the powders right
there so you can also which I actually
thought was kind of cool you can pull
the sifter out really easily and then
you're just seeing powder so however you
wanted to do it you could do it either
way and I think that's nice to have the
option kinda like the cover FX ones but
is a classic white translucent powder
very finely milled I've used this once
or twice and I liked it do I think it's
like a par above any other white
translucent powder no I think it's on
par with it but if you're a sucker for
the packaging or maybe you need a new
one and you want to try something new I
did like it so I think it's a good
powder next for I have not tried so the
first one I got is the flower beauty
ultimate eye primer and it says it's in
your prime eye primer it's crease free
long wear and visible finish so again
their packaging really is nice this has
a metal or at least maybe it's not metal
it just almost feel pesky like metal
little cover so let's see is this white
or like nude it is a white primer kind
of feels like Elmer's glue not when you
blend it though very very creamy doesn't
have it smell that I noticed which is
good tobacco some of their lip products
can smell like floral and I like floral
to a certain extent that some of them
really made me nauseous so it feels very
I don't know it almost doesn't feel silk
Oni it just feels soft so I'll have to
try that and let you know how it
actually holds on the shadow but I like
the sleek black packaging with the gold
lettering I think that's really pretty
next I got their perfecting primer it
says prime prime of your life
moisturize visibly smooth and soften the
skin while creating a perfect base for
foundation some bold claims there so it
says same great formula a new package so
I'm assuming it used to be in different
packaging but again that's a really
pretty metal emblem there so it's a
white but kind of clear primer feels
like moisturizing primers that I have
doesn't really have a smell but it feels
really moisturizing it really does feel
on par with like my coconut Joe one from
Marc Jacobs very moisturizing kind of
lightweight gel formula which
I actually really like so I'm excited to
give this one a try next product is this
flower pop powder blush it reminded me
of the Milani one even the packaging of
it because I have a flower kind of in
the blush you know I make any sense this
one's in the shade pb-1 which is sweet
pea and so such cute clear packaging
even on the bottom who it's really soft
it's not like in-your-face pigments kit
but it definitely has enough color that
it's going to look pretty and again I've
told you guys a million times that I
often like blushes that aren't crazy
pigmented and I think this is the color
that's right up my alley because it's
just kind of a rosy pink it's not too
bright pink but it's not too deep it's
just right in between last thing is this
flower long-wear lip cream says it's
color proof and it's in the shade I'm
blushing so I'm curious about the
packaging oh okay
so you twist off the lid and you squeeze
it through it's got one of those hard
sponge kind of applicators but it the
color looks really pretty kind of like
that multicolor it's one that it's so on
trend right now the formula feels like
it'd be really really comfortable as
well I'm not a huge fan of that kind of
applicator I typically would just
squeeze it onto my finger and then apply
just because I don't know I don't like
that hard kind of sponge it never
applies the way I wanted to I'd much
prefer a doe foot applicator I'm really
liking that that is a pleasant surprise
and it doesn't smell like flowers thank
you I was so concerned it would it
doesn't so those were all the products I
recently picked up from Walmart I also
today filmed a drugstore haul of a bunch
of other throughout the store products
that I I mean I actually bought at
Walmart on the same day but it was it
would have been too long in the video so
I separated that but it's also I think
it's even more products in this so if
you want to see more drugstore things
that I've picked up and my kind of
initial thoughts on them I will link
that below otherwise I hope you'll come
say hi on my social media which is jam
you 289 everywhere and I'll see you guys
in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
