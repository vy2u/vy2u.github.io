bringing you my Disney World haul and I
am so excited because I have watched so
many of these before I went this most
recent trip of ours and we go all the
time we're now in your pass holders even
though we don't live anywhere near
Disney World but we are annual pass
holders because we go a couple times a
year and we definitely are going a
couple times this year so if you like
Disney definitely subscribe I've got I
just did the Disney tag which I'll link
up there and below where I answered a
bunch of Disney questions and talked
about Disney World a lot but I also do
Disney World hauls quite often I'll link
my most recent one down below from when
we went to both Disney World and
Disneyland Paris which was so much fun
other than that let's go and get into it
so as every Disney World haul starts
I've got to mention the resort mugs that
we got while we were there we stayed at
Port Orleans Riverside this time and the
last time we were there we stayed at
Grande flirty and we've also stayed it
like the All Stars a lot and pop Century
Animal Kingdom Lodge really the only
moderate that we've ever stayed at was
Portland's Riverside and it was
absolutely gorgeous I could not believe
how beautiful it was my husband Tyler
has a channel on here that's travel and
Disney and he uploads our vlogs and we
have a lot of vlogs coming from this
trip so if they're up I'll link them
below or at least his channel I know I
keep saying that but there's just a lot
of Disney stuff that we've done recently
that I don't want you guys to miss so
these are really cute I of course got
the purple and he got the blue and I'm
excited that there are new ones because
I feel like it was the same mob for ever
two guys filming Jesus and it was also
kind of expensive but you get them so
you can refill them any time you want
coffee soda pop I don't think I've ever
actually said soda pop like that I
usually just say pop anyway um
tea hot chocolate whatever you can
refill those whenever you need and it's
already included in the price you paid
for the cup
is really nice especially if you're
staying for a longer time this trip was
much quicker usually we stayed for like
7 to 10 days it's definitely worth the
money for those longer trips these ears
I did not buy on this trip I've had for
a while I feel like I'm finally breaking
them in I've had them for like two trips
now no no no yeah this was my second
trip with them and they were really
really tight and you'll see in the vlogs
I have them on and then I take them off
and then they're on then they're off
because they're really tight but I think
I'm finally breaking them in where
they're not as tight so it also of
course rained there so I ended up
finally buying a poncho for all the
times I've been at Disney when it rained
I've never bought a poncho and I'm like
you know what whatever these are cute
they used to be bright yellow and my
mother-in-law was with this this time
Tyler's mom and she is a Disney fanatic
as well and so she had a bright yellow
one and it was so like almost vintage
Disney now but she let me wear it for
part of the time which was so nice but
the ones I have now are clear and
they're I think they're like under ten
dollars and they're thinner the yellow
one she had is actually way nicer it's
thicker you can tell us more when we
these are thinner but they still they
flick the water off and that's their job
so and it just says Disney parks and
it's got both the castle and Mickey
which i think is so cute and of course
lists of Anaheim Orlando Tokyo Paris
Hong Kong and now they need to say
Shanghai because that's opening um but
it was well worth the money rain
actually a lot while we were there here
in March and my husband Tyler he got one
finally as well so I'm glad we finally
have them because really if you get the
air out you fold it down it folds down
pretty let me squeeze it pretty small I
mean considering it's really convenient
to have this versus like an umbrella an
umbrella is great we can't wear it on a
ride you can't walk around with it as
easily you got your hands-free with this
which I love so that was like finally I
bought one I don't know widened by one
like three trips ago all right let's get
into some of the girly things that I
bought like things you can wear one of
the things I bought was did oh my gosh I
bought a lot this lanyard it severe
Bradley one so it's overpriced for what
it was but it has a Mickey as like the
thing that clasps on to the things you
want on your lanyard and then later just
like pretty pink and purple which are my
favorite colors but they're really tiny
little Mickey's hidden throughout and I
thought oh my gosh yes because most
people like if I'm meeting with parents
I mean most of them know that I love
Disney at this point the school year but
um you know it's not so flashy Disney
but it's still cute and it's durable
definitely and I love it and I wear one
of these every day
she's got my whistle for recess on it
and I I love it so much I'm so excited
to finally have one that I like love um
I also bought this ring this ring has
Mickey on it and it's just kind of like
these I think it said I'd have swore off
Swarovski crystals on it it was pricey
for what it was but it wasn't like $100
I think it was like over $30 so it
wasn't super cheap but it wasn't super
expensive so I don't know if it's like
sterling silver where it'll where it
won't turn my finger green or not I've
worn it quite a lot and it hasn't turned
my finger green yet so I love it I think
it's so cute I've worn it here in real
life too not just at Disney just cuz I'm
like I just like it
it's kind of big but I don't really mind
but if you're like I don't want everyone
to know I love Disney this might be too
big but um I love it
oh and I this should be said now on the
video that we did there were some things
we didn't buy to her like well we can
buy it on that app they have now which
is like the shop parks app which I can
link the app below if I can find the
actual like link for the app but um it
really is nice because if you spend over
$50 on the app anyway you get free
shipping so we just ordered some
presents for my parents because we're
taking them this summer so we bought my
dad like a special gift he can use there
when we go and my mom a special gift and
then we also got a magnet because we
always buy a magnet when we go just to
represent either the resort we stayed at
that time or just something special that
happened that trip and we ended up like
somehow forgetting to buy a magnet this
trip so we bought one that's at a poor
darlings Riverside and what I'm very
excited about is that I've been
complaining for a while to myself and I
know a lot of other YouTube
is that are obsessive Disney have all
been complaining that they don't really
do a lot of resort specific things
anymore at the gift shops well they must
have heard everyone's cry because all of
a sudden this trip it was like boom they
had tons of things that were resorts
specific so at Port Orleans Riverside
they had magnets cups Hass shirts I mean
just everything you can imagine they
have and that was so awesome because you
know when you say the resort especially
if it's like a more expensive one like
thinking of the Grand Floridian of the
Polynesian you want something to
represent that time where you spent a
lot of money to stay in a really nice
place there but it's also such a special
memory for you so I love that they
finally have that so we ended up getting
the Portland's Riverside magnet but it's
coming in the mail literally I think
it's supposed to be delivered tomorrow
so I don't have it to show but I was
really excited to finally be able to get
something specific they did have
ornaments too so it's exciting we didn't
get one though maybe we should have no
we'll see we've got lots of ornaments um
ok another thing I bought you might make
fun of me but I love Minnie Mouse and
they had these I saw for the first time
in Frontierland right outside of Splash
Mountain they have a little gift shop
there and we were killing some time
they're waiting on our fast pastime to
start and I saw this little hair tie and
I am sure it is meant for children but I
was like you know what I think it is so
cute it's a little hair tie so when you
actually like pull your hair up you can
have it in your hair and I thought that
is adorable so I'll wear it I didn't end
up wearing it the rest that trips I got
at the very last day we were there and
of course I'm not going to wear it here
in real life but in fake life when I'm
at Disney I will totally wear this so
that way I don't always have to wear
this I can have the bow in and it's kind
of the same effect but it's way more
comfortable and especially we're going
this summer when it's going to be even
more sweaty and humid it's gonna be
perfect so I'm really excited it does
have Minnie Mouse's little signature and
her little face there I think it's so
cute and it was like 5 bucks
so speaking of many I also got this tank
top which I haven't seen at all anywhere
and all it is is it's polka dots and
it's kind of
heather gray it might look cream on
camera and it just has your face with
your eyes closed and her little lashes
in her bow but what I loved is it has
this little peekaboo little keyhole in
the back which I thought was just cute
and it's really I got mine in hopefully
an extra-small it's usually that I get
ya an extra small but it's still kind of
big and like comfy and flowy so I think
that is exactly what you want when
you're hot in the park and you've got
shorts on maybe the shorts are like
squeezing you a little too much and
you're like I don't want like a
form-fitting tank top you want something
a little loose to hurt a little more
comfortable this is what you want so I
loved it so that was an exciting
purchase but then my one up I can't even
say this is my favorite cuz I have too
many favorites but one of my favorite
purchases I posted on my Instagram while
we were there I was posting a ton and
this was kind of expensive it was like
$50 but it was a sweatshirt it must have
been brand-new to the parks when I
bought it because a lot of the cast
members were asking me where I got it
and I was like you work here but it must
have been really new when we went to the
California Grill at the contemporary a
couple people that worked they were
asking me like where did you get that
that's so cute like it is cute isn't it
but I bought it in was a holiday up
Hollywood studios at one of the shops
there on the main like Sunset Strip or
whatever they call it but it just has
the castle in the Epcot ball and what
else the Tower of Terror because of
course they took away the Sorcerer's hat
which it's no longer the main draw there
which really the theater is supposed to
be the main draw they called the weenie
but they always put Tower of Terror it
seems now to represent that Park which
is fine I love that right and then the
animal kingdom little Tree of Life
so I love this I love that it's like
that cream color and it's actually a
really well made sweatshirt I bought a
hoodie there last time and you'll see it
in my old flop or my old haul and I
loved it it has Mickey really big and I
think it says like Mickey Mouse Club or
something like that but the more I wash
it the thinner it gets it's really
bizarre so now it's like kind of all
stretched out and just ah I still wear
and I
ward on that trip but I was very excited
when I bought this and I ended up
wearing this a lot while we were there
because it was rainy and kind of chilly
at night and I wore this almost every
night to be honest so well worth the
money I loved it so much
so I also bought and this was inspired
by a bunch of halls that I watched the
monsters University hat this is so cute
first of all monsters University is one
of my favorite favorite film monsters
inc just that whole franchise in general
I love so much and so monsters
University is one of my favorites as
well and I thought this hat is too cute
looks like a little monster munched it
here in the corner and I have again this
was another thing that as I wore it a
lot of people asked where did you buy
that I want to buy it and it was you
know under $20 I think I ended up buying
mine like maybe I bought it at the
contemporary while we were there just in
a gift shop it was raining and we were
killing time in there um so I also
bought one of my favorite purchases this
bracelet and I'll show you a close-up
cuz it's hard to see it has these little
you know like cute little rhinestones it
was probably like $15 maybe a little
more but it has these little Mickey
heads on it and I thought it was so cute
and I usually stack bracelets like three
or four of them that are kind of
dangling and bankley and this one fits
right in so I've been wearing it just
everyday to work I just love it and
again it's one of those things that you
wouldn't know it's Mickey unless you
just know so I love that about it and
it's kind of heavy which again I like it
feels more well made we also bought a
Disney World cookbook now the last time
we were there we bought the kitchen
magic with Mickey one and its favorite
recipes from the Disney parks and the
cruise ships so we have actually made I
have little markers in here quite a lot
from this cookbook and they're all like
un-freakin'-believable we've made like
the truffle mac and cheese from the
yacht club sweet potato rosemary
biscuits from it's actually from
Disneyland at the
by restaurant but there's tons in here
that's so good and it's exciting because
as you go to more and more restaurants
there there are more things you've
actually tried yourself there that you
want to make it home which i think is
fun so this time you bought the other
one and it's called chef Mickey
treasures from the vault and delicious
new favorites so we really haven't
looked at this too much I'm intrigued
you like one of the recipes
yeah so like these say exactly where
it's from broccoli slaw from 1900 park
fare at the Grand Floridian or this is
from Bulma which is at the Kingdom
Animal Kingdom Lodge so I'm that's Walt
look at that picture of him that is cool
I don't know why that caught me so off
guard but I really haven't looked to
this at all
okay take notice of his shirt here
because something I'm about to show you
in a second actually connects to that so
that's really cool I got to show my
husband that picture that's cool anyway
so that was just exciting because we
both like to cook and my husband is an
amazing cook but um I will definitely
use those and it's just even another way
we can have Disney magic like every
single day or at least once a week
another tradition we just started is
buying they now have this artwork that
is of the resort you stay at so we've
stated a lot of them but we just now
started this and we wanted to buy when
we stayed at the Grand flirting for our
honeymoon last summer we wanted to buy
this size of that but by the time we
were going to buy it it sold out we were
like we should have just bought it the
first time around well this time we
bought this the second we saw it and
this is a quarter leans Riverside and
it's so beautiful there I could not get
over I had heard it was beautiful but
actually staying there and walking the
grounds I was like this should be a
deluxe resort it is so gorgeous if
you've never stayed there Orser resort
hop there you should so I was so excited
to get this and so we're going to order
the Grand Floridian one this size when
it actually comes available so we need
to get the Grand Floridian one since
that's kind of when we wanted to start
this tradition but from now on we want
to just do it we figure it's thin enough
you can
in your luggage like in between clothes
without it taking up like any room so we
want to use these on a wall somewhere
and just have a collage of these which
for us we'll just we'll just love that
so this was something my husband got he
did not buy like anything and he never
really does like I mean the freaking nut
that just buys a ton of things but this
shirt was actually really expensive but
he was set on this shirt and it is from
this new brand called 28 in Maine and
it's a Disney World brand or a Disney
brand but 28 of course represents the
year that Mickey Mouse was like kind of
came out and Maine represents Main
Street and this logo is on all of this
logo was on all of the clothing designs
that they had this brand and it's kind
of like a lion reaching for a star and
so Tyler looked it up and he realized it
was actually on the crest of the castles
in the Disney parks so he was like that
is some deep Disney right there and we
kept joking about deep Disney and how
there are some things that like you know
most just like newbies to Disney or
maybe just people that you know they're
there with the family but they're not
like Disney nuts like we are they
wouldn't necessarily know that or catch
that but you and I the deep Disney nerds
would catch that or at least look it up
and figure it out so he loved it it is a
really well made long-sleeve shirts
buttoned up it's totally up his alley
especially like with the sleeves rolled
up it looks so cute on him
so he was so excited about this and this
looks like the shirt Disney was wearing
in that picture of the cookbook so I'm
excited to show Tyler that because I
don't think he knows that I also bought
the net okay so I'm reading the kingdom
keeper series which is the Disney World
it's a book set in Disney World and it's
it's a whole series actually and they're
just good they're clearly youth fiction
but I love them and even brought them to
my classroom and some of my students are
reading them so I bought the second one
is the Kingdom Keepers Disney at dawn
and I only you know I'm on page 42 so
I'm not really far into it but it jumps
right into the action which is awesome
if you've read the first one you don't
need a bunch of exposition so I'm very
excited it seems as though they have a
different like main villain in each one
just based on the the cover alone in the
first one the villain you know what I
will tell you in case you read it but
only the series below if you're curious
about it I'm just kidding I bought this
last trip but honestly like everyone
talked about him in their Disney hauls
and I was like I feel like he should
like make it appearance even though I
didn't mind this time but look how cute
he is I think when I first bought him I
had posted on Instagram like should I
buy him or the Alice like little tea mug
that has kind of a similar shape but it
was Alice in Wonderland like a little
scene from the movie on the cup and of
course everyone was like chit duh but I
still want to buy the Alice one and they
still sell it I can't believe I didn't
buy it this time maybe this summer but
he's so cute he just wanted to say hi
another thing I actually did not get
this from Disney World but I bought it
right before we left that was love is
this little white kind of fake plastic
mason jar type thing with a handle this
is at the Disney Store on clearance so
if you have a Disney Store Lee near you
look and see if they have it because it
is so cute
I think you've literally it's got one of
those drawers that kind of like stops it
so um but I use it every single day
because I'm constantly walking around
with water and I loved it and I wanted
to mention it in case you do have a
Disney store near you and you can look
also if you're just curious about other
things to buy at Disney this was another
thing I bought the last time I was there
but it's this via Bradley bag and it has
again it's overpriced for what it is but
I'm like the fact that it's Disney
though it has like Mickey strewn
throughout the pattern they have way
cuter and I say cuter because now I'm
like wanting and I don't want to like no
you do not need that but they have ones
that are like pink and purple and blue
that had Mickey strewn throughout the
pattern so you should definitely look
and they've got like crossbody bags and
duffel bags all kinds of things that
have Disney in the veera design so it's
so cute so so cute so I think I covered
everything that we bought while we were
there I think other than that I hope
that you enjoyed I hope you'll check out
my other Disney videos and I hope you'll
check out our vlogs over on Tyler's
channel and I hope you'll subscribe to
catch more in the future that are coming
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
