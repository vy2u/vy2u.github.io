for my honeymoon
it was long it was awesome if you want
to know what i was up to check out my
instagram i've got tons of pictures from
it and we also have been doing vlogs
every single day or we filmed them so
he's still tyler that is my husband he's
got his channel and that's where all of
our vlogs are I'll link it below if you
want to watch them all of our disney
vlogs are coming up and this video is
all about disney this is everything i
bought in disneyland paris and in disney
world which is in orlando we kind of
went crazy because we're both disney
freaks we go like twice a year we just
love it and because we were also going
to disney in paris for the first time we
just went bonkers so this is all kind of
mixed in because there were a lot of
things that are sold at both parks i
will also try and find some of these
things are also sold on the Disney theme
parks like store online so I'll try and
link those below too for what I can find
most of this I think I'll be able to
find so definitely check if you're
interested so we bought this bag in
Disney in Paris cuz we literally had no
room in our luggage we needed another
piece of luggage to hold everything so
that's what everything is in right now
this bag was actually one of those deals
where just like if you spend $30 you get
this bag for like 15 or you know
something like that and it was totally
worth it to us cuz we needed it and we
liked it because there's kind of gender
neutral and yeah
so the first thing we always get are the
resort mugs at Disney World
these are around 13 or 14 dollars but
the whole time you're there you get like
unlimited drinks and now it's like
coffee tea soft drinks whatever you want
so each morning we could go and fill it
up with coffee or whatever we wanted we
went in October and the same cups were
there so I just got a different color I
got red and he got blue last time I got
purple and he got green but it's the
same image but just with different
colors here so this is so exciting I
also had to get my ears obviously
because ears actually this is the first
time I've ever gotten ears at
Disneyworld which is crazy because I've
gone so many times but they're so fun
and these are just like the
I think ones they also had sequined but
I just like these a little bit better
one thing I got that I post on Instagram
it was between this one and another mug
its coffee mug and it was an
overwhelming vote for this one and it is
chip in a mug I could not believe it's
like actually chip and they have the
little chip in it like just kind of
paint it on it is so flippin cute I
can't wait to use this and of course I
bought a few mugs and I had to just put
him in my carry-on and just carry him
around with me because there was no way
I was putting this in a checked bag but
so cute this one so is the price I get
was $20 and the other one I was gonna
get was the cute Alice one if you've
seen it it's so cute too and it was a
lot cheaper it was like 13 or 14 but I
mean chip we started collecting pressed
pennies we have never done this before
but they have little press coin machines
either quarters or pennies all over the
place and Disney World and so we bought
the little book that they have and it
smells like that really cheap plastic
you know it's the best so we got some of
them pressed and we've got everywhere
that we got and a drink in Epcot so like
we got margaritas in Mexico and the
orange slush thing which is amazing in
France we got pennies for those
countries so we figure in the future
once we kind of tried something from
everywhere we'll get all the countries
oh so those are here and then we also
got Magic Kingdom we figure what we'll
do is just all four Parks Magic Kingdom
Epcot Hollywood studios and Animal
Kingdom and then we also got a pressed
quarter here with the year and we figure
we'll just do that each year just get
one press quarter cuz they're like you
can put in four quarters and the quarter
two press so it's like a dollar 25 for
those looks like geez but worth it i'm
very excited think it's so fun to just
collect these alright so the next thing
I ran into a few subscribers and Disney
we're all names awesome and I got to
meet you got it's just awesome to meet
you guys it makes everything seem which
seems so much more real and not like
it's just very weird to sit in a room
alone and film and talk to a camera and
you know comment back it's not the same
so meeting you guys in person
is literally the coolest thing ever and
one of my lovely subscribers gave me
these this is the beautifully Disney
collection and it's these two and one
brushes and I before I left I told you
guys that I wanted to get some
beautifully Disney like makeup and stuff
and then a lot of you guys told me it's
discontinued and it wasn't in the
marketplace at Downtown Disney anymore
or the coop so I think it was just
continuing but she had already
I guess already snagged these so that
was so awesome thank you so much very
exciting we also got this is more know
this is for both of us
we got a cookbook there and it's called
kitchen magic with Mickey they had two
different ones this was the newer
version they have totally different
recipes but it's stuff from the parks
and from the resorts so like some of
these are from Disneyland a lot of them
are from Disney World but some of them
are specifically from like a resort like
this ones from the Wilderness Lodge they
even have the kitchen sink which is like
a really famous dessert and Magic
Kingdom they even have that here so
awesome we are so excited to cook from
this to be both both love to cook so
it's so much fun and that was just an
extra way to have Disney in our everyday
life even though it's totally not Disney
but it is okay so I did get some clothes
I'll show you some of them this one I
got in Epcot at the World Showcase in
Mexico and again I post on Instagram if
I should buy it because I saw it a month
okay I love it but it's a kid size but
it'd be like you could get it a little
bigger so it's still fit you you know
what I mean but it's just kid size the 3
couple years like my favorite ever and
this was $20 but I love it so much isn't
it so cute it is simple I mean there's
nothing that special about it but I just
love it then I love the Three Caballeros
and like me and my brother used to be
obsessed with the stay along songs where
they have this song from this in it so
it's like a big piece of my childhood I
was so excited to have this this I got
in Disney in Paris I got so many
questions about it was this little tank
top and it's just got all these
different kinds of bows on it and I
don't remember how much this one I all
their tanks are like $30 because they're
there
expensive but I love this one I ended up
wearing this like four different days
because we just kept doing laundry
I just kept wearing this it's so cute
and what I love about it is it doesn't
necessarily scream Disney so I could
wear it I mean I would wear it any day
regardless but you can wear it all the
time the only thing is that the very
bottom it says mini but it's so cute and
this I did not see at Disneyworld I
looked everywhere and I didn't see it
there so but I'll see if I can find it
online um I got another shirt but it
must be deeper in here so I also got a
bunch of stuff from Basin which is that
Disney World they have one in the Grand
Floridian which is where we were staying
but they also had some or they had a
basis or at Downtown Disney did I call
it down to Disney earlier I can't stop
doing it we made a joke about Downton
Abbey like two years ago went down to
Downtown Disney I can't stop saying
Downton Disney and selling an idiot of
course eventually it'll be Disney spring
so it doesn't matter but I think I'm
gonna do this in a separate hall because
there's a lot we got we got like bath
salts and bath bombs and soaps and I'm
gonna give you a sneak peek of one of
them look at this I might just film this
video right after this I don't know but
just know that I will definitely do that
at home because if there's a lot there's
a lot okay we also got a Mickey coffee
scoop it's so cute it's got the little
hand but I love and it's just all
stainless steel so it's not like red
yellow and black but it's two
tablespoons and it's just simple and
adorable
Tyler is one of the spot of this one I
wanted it I love it this I got for me
for my classroom since I'm a teacher
it's - Minnie Mouse ones with little
Minnie Mouse erasers my pencils seem to
always disappear from my desk so I want
to have something on them that's
super-dee-duper obvious that if someone
had them I would know it was mine so
next thing oh this one I got in Paris
it's another coffee mug it says Paris
but it's got fashionable mini with her
long legs on every single letter it's so
cute and I love the little bow now I
don't know if I'm gonna use use this
because I might use it to like hold
brushes because it's so cute like I
don't want anything to happen to this
and really when I bought it like it's
almost more decorative than useful and I
love the bow I don't know we'll see
oh here's the other tank this one I got
at Disney World and it's just this again
more bows I got so many things with bows
it's crazy
but this one again was like 30 something
dollars but I wore this like two or
three days there and I loved it it's got
a little bit of sparkle again in the
bottom it says many a lot of people have
this shirt there which made me want it
even more because I kept seeing it I was
like oh my gosh so cute and again this
is something that I can just wear
whatever it doesn't really matter I also
bought these shorts they're just simple
like pajama shorts but they have Minnie
Mouse in the corner and then they have
cute little polkadot drawstrings and
they're so comfortable they had a
matching like zip up Hoodie which was
cute but I'm like want to necessarily
want a matching set but I just love PJs
shorts I get so hot at night and these
are perfect so I was so excited about
finding those I have bought a pair of
shoes there I've never done this but
since we do go all the time I'm like you
know I don't feel as dumb buying things
that have like a Mickey hat on them
because I know I can bring them with me
every single time we go and wear them
and over time wear them out so I got
these shoes well actually I should say
Tyler got the bird I mean we're using
the same bank account but he was the one
that was like you should get him and I
tried him on he's like no really they're
cute he was so sweet about it and they
just have these little Mickey heads on
them and little bows and they're cute
because because they're black and white
they really do match most things of
course they got a pattern on them but I
love them and they're really comfortable
too so then I loved wearing them since
we stayed at the Grand Floridian we
always get magnets everywhere we go and
we put them we don't put them on our
fridge we put them on our washer and
dryer because it's just cute and it's
out of the way but we get to see them
but it's not necessary cluttering up our
kitchen so every time we do laundry it's
just like exciting I'm doing laundry
today and I get to look at all of the
ones we have this is the Grand Floridian
one and
it's just simple but I loved how
old-timey it is and it was just so
magical so that was awesome
Tyler got these theme park attraction
posters these are like the retro like
old-school like the Walt Disney World
railroad and the Haunted Mansion with
the hitchhiking ghosts and country Bear
Jamboree and the old 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea ride just all kinds of
things the monorail system just so
vintage retro Disney it's amazing we
don't know where which ones we're gonna
use them where we're gonna put them I
told them we should just put the Haunted
Mansion went out at Halloween time I
love the Haunted Mansion
I've noticed that Disney is really like
embracing their vintage stuff lately
they now have mugs with all this stuff
and they have dishes whereas they I
swear last year when we went they didn't
have all this stuff so it's really
really cool to see okay we also got this
is in Disneyland Paris this is it a
trivet is that what it's called yeah a
glass trivet to hold hops and pans and
it really is glass so again this was in
my carry-on but I loved it because the
designs you can see the little Mickey's
in them but it's not like again
glaringly Mickey I mean it's pretty
obvious to me that it's Mickey's but if
you didn't know you wouldn't necessarily
notice which i think is so cool and
that's what both of us we love Mickey
but if we're gonna have stuff around we
want us to know but not necessarily
everyone to know you don't see him this
video is gonna be 10,000 years old okay
so while we were there we bought this
wine called Once Upon a vine and I think
it sold outside of Disneyworld I swear
I've seen it but it's all kind of Disney
and fairy tale themed which is really
cool we I don't even remember we tried
the Chardonnay they all have clever
names and one of the Reds anyway but we
didn't have a wine bottle opener and we
wanted to get one of the stoppers anyway
so we got the thing that had both and
now we'll just get to use them but I
thought that was so adorable we just put
him back in here to travel him to
traveling back home to get them back
home
okay there's so much more all right um
oh so you should know that Simba in
Boston my two pugs are actually my
parents pugs
so I don't get to say I didn't get to
take them with me and then just
brokenhearted because who knows like
mine but he's not really so that being
said I we want to get a dog obviously so
now I want it to be a pug but I don't
know but we did since we know we are
gonna get one we got a leash for it
there and it's just so simple and cute
black with silver little Mickey's on it
and paw prints I just love it this was
Tyler's fine he was so excited about it
all right we also got a picture frame
and let me open it it's so cute
we wanted it again to be kind of classy
but I mean obviously you haven't put a
picture in it yet but we just loved it
it said like sharing Disney magic
moments with those we love it's so sweet
so I'm not sure what picture we'll put
in it but I just thought that was so
cute
again it's not fun to get home that's
the big downside about it and if we had
driven and be wager we could get
everything we wanted alright so we also
get ornaments when we go places I mean a
lot of people you know people get shot
glasses or they'll get I don't know
whatever but we always get typically a
magnet in an ornament or at least one or
the other just cuz it's exciting at
Christmastime when you're putting
everything up remembering oh I remember
when we got you're just kind of walking
down memory lane every time you put your
Christmas tree up and I'll usually just
get like a silver paint marker and write
on the bottom of the ornament the year
but this one we found in Paris and it's
just a marriage Minnie and Mickey is so
cute so I was so excited about finding
that and I think again I'll write the
year on the bottom I don't think I would
forget the year but still okay what else
this is also from design and Tara
oh I just took some of the balloons they
had at when you check in this I got I
decided for each Disney park I go to I
want to get one of these I have the
Disney World one it's like a 3d
well half 3d it's a 3d castle with a
flatback magnet and it's in my classroom
so now I've got the Disney Paris wand
and I figure if we ever go to Tokyo and
when we go to Disneyland in California
I'll get the castle when it's there to
see a cute with a collection for myself
and then we also got a magnet together
which is just the Disneyland Paris one
with Mickey on it and we both like the
metal ones too they're so nice so
awesome these balloons I was gonna give
to my I don't know I gotta pick between
all my nieces and nephews which ones I'm
gonna give it to all right so to match
that glass trivet we also got kitchen
towels how cute are these there's two
different ones there's like a darker one
and then the lighter one and again it's
got the Mickey's infused in it I just
thought that was so adorable
and then I got some socks in Disneyland
Paris I think I saw these same ones in
Disney World as well they certainly have
socks there but these were so cute and I
love the striped one that has Minnie
Mouse with the bow on it and then
there's the middle one that have it
looks like flowers yeah it looks like
flowers in the shape of Mickey's head
and then the Polka Dot ones so cute so
I'm so excited about all this I know I
keep saying that but I am I can't have
it oh let's go for the first time Disney
World uses magic bands Disneyland Paris
does not but Disney World you get your
Magic Band each year before you trip
well I've never gotten a little they
called band it's the little things you
stick on through the holes so I finally
got some this year because I've always
been like no like that's just gonna make
it's just more stuff but this was all
for parks this is the only one I
couldn't fit animal kingdom but it has
the castle for Magic Kingdom the Epcot
ball and then the Hat for Hollywood
studios which of course is taken down
but it still makes me think of Hollywood
studios so and I Animal Kingdom couldn't
fit because that was the hole I had to
like actually push in to keep it on but
I thought that was so fun
then I think I'm gonna keep them cuz you
get a new magic band each trip I'm gonna
keep these in here until my next trip
and use them but I thought that was so
fun
they have like the Haunted Mansion
ghosts you can put on there I figure if
we go for Halloween I want to get those
cuz it's just so fun and I love it we
found at the Christmas shop in Downtown
Disney
I said it right the this ornament but it
has all the Disney parks on it so like
these lights are supposed to light up I
haven't taken it out yet cuz I don't
want to run out the battery but
everywhere there's the Disney park on
the globe there's a little white and
then it has the castle for each Park and
we thought that's so perfect because we
went to two parks in this trip which was
crazy and we'll probably never get to do
that again so we thought this is like
the only time we could ever buy
something like this and it actually has
meaning so this is such a cool find all
right I think this is the last thing Oh
what things up so we got this in the
airport we were ok everyone collects
pins at Disney World and we don't and we
never have oh my god and I can't imagine
wearing like the lanyards but the pins
on it's like 100 degrees out like it
just makes you sweaty er and plus we
both talked about feel like we don't
want to buy pins and trade them because
if we bought in that means they're
meaningful to us and they're kind of
expensive
for what they are but then we were at
the airport to go home and we were
already like arranging this Disney and
then we were looking at the pins and I
saw these and they're these mr. and mrs.
pins and I was like Tyler this is the
only trip we could ever buy this on and
it makes sense because if we did it the
next time we go it's not our honeymoon
so it's like yeah it wouldn't have the
same meaning so he was like well you are
right and so we got up and he said well
if we're gonna buy those we might as
well get maybe another one maybe two I
was like you're right so we got he
picked out this one it's um
one that opens it says it was all
started with um house I mean it doesn't
say a mouse but it's got Walt and Mickey
in there and then Mickey out there
Steamboat Willie Mickey and then I
picked out the aladdin and Jasmine one
and if you know why this is important to
me in Tyler comment down below I'm
curious to see how many of you guys know
why this is important to us so that was
a very
fine so and then I'll show you this bag
one more time because I couldn't really
show it to you before but it's just cute
I mean it's simple but it was pretty
darn sturdy and it held a lot and we
even checked this and I did pretty well
it got a little dirty on the back that's
for sure but um it was a it was an
awesome find
so we got a lot of stuff but we love
Disney and it certainly will have a
happy home here let me know what you are
the most interested in from Disney or if
you have recently been there and you got
something really cool let me know below
because the next time I go I just might
get it because I love Disney um but I
realize think I have way too many coffee
bugs so I need to like pare it down a
little bit like maybe get rid of a few
to be able to keep these because
otherwise we're not gonna be able to
close those kitchen cabinets and all my
coffee mugs are and Disney all of them
it's a sick obsession but anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this definitely check
out for the basin haul coming up soon
and subscribe if you enjoyed and I'll
catch you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
