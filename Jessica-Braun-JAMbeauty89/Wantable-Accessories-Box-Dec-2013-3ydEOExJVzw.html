knocking out videos left and right today
I know I would like been wearing the
same thing for the past three videos but
I mean I got I'm busy
so I'm like trying to stuff these in and
I love filming for you guys so I wanted
to make sure I got a few videos done so
um I have been doing a lot of
subscription box videos which is great
because I want you guys to know what's
out there because there's so much this
is one that's very different it is is
this the pricy subscription box I think
it is however it's like the most high
ends so it kind of makes sense this is
wantable now one suppose different
because they offer three different
options they offer a makeup subscription
box which is you know like boxycharm or
if c or any of those except for it's all
high-end makeup they also offer an
accessories box which is like jewelry
scarves sunglasses things like that and
then they also offer a an intimate box
which is like ham i mean it's not that
racy it's like camisole 's and
undergarments things like that i ended
up choosing the accessories box cuz i
was like you know i have a lot of makeup
yes that is true and i've got a lot of
makeup left to review and try out so i
figured why not do accessories that's
not something i buy for myself as often
so that's what I went with and this is
the December accessories box becomes
just real simple cute packaging this is
$36 a month um so like I said it is
pricier however also like I said it's
more higher-end products better made so
it's I mean seems pretty awesome to me
it comes with a few boxes or cards
explaining you know like take pictures
of what you got and just information
about things they had a limited edition
holiday box I'm not sure if it's still
available not I'm gonna have link a link
below so you can check it out see if it
is but it also comes with kind of like a
statement of all the things you receive
and what their prices originally which
is kind of insane when I show you these
but what I think is really cool and I'm
being honest with you guys I think this
is awesome
I wish every subscription box did this
now most services will do a thing where
you take like a survey and they'll kind
of take what you say and like use it to
help cater your box but for the most
part there's semi generic no I'm not
completely being automate this one is
but it gets down to the nitty-gritty and
they're asking you like do you like for
accessories do you like bangles do you
like stretchy bracelets you like gold D
like silver do you like mixed metals
do you like leather do you like
bracelets made out of fabric do you like
things with Christian symbols do you
like things with Buddhist symbols I mean
so specific and basically you tell them
whether you love that thing whether you
like it or whether you dislike it if you
say you dislike it you will never ever
receive it in your box so if I say no I
don't want anything that has words on it
like if I don't want any more bracelets
that say love or peace I can say dislike
they will never send me that if you say
you love it you're very likely to get it
if you say you like it you might get it
you might not in your mark so I thought
that was really cool um so let's see
sorry I know my throat is sore coz I've
been filming a lot okay so this one I
love this box I have to admit because I
got these these earrings I've already
worn them I had to put them back in
because I've already wore them I don't
love them these earrings which are
absolutely gorgeous I love gold and
silver together because well you can
wear with anything it's like literally
the best of both worlds so they're just
I have earrings that are similar but not
mixed metal like this so I just love
them they're just so pretty the original
price of these are $18 remember I got
this whole box for 36 these would be
originally $18 I also got this necklace
again silver and gold mix so they really
took into account the fact that I like
gold and silver together look at this so
it's got gold silver gold so well and
actually this is like a deeper you know
like a darker silver I'm not sure if
it's coming across but I love this
necklace I have also worn this already I
had to put it back in here for the video
this was originally $24 it's called the
Franky necklace and the earrings were
called Nora earrings 24
dollars so already what 24 and 18 this
is taking me way too long
30 42 so already this is $42 worth so
I've already surpassed the price of the
box that's awesome so the last thing
that I got was this scarf and the
original price for the scarf was $42 so
the total for the box would have been
$84 but it only cost $36 so um this
scarf is really really pretty it's a
shape that I wouldn't typically pick out
for myself it's like a square shape if
you open a two mungus you can still wrap
it around like a normal scarf but it's
got this beautiful beautiful pattern
look at this isn't that beautiful
I just think it's so pretty it's such a
nice like dressy silky scarf it just
feels very luxurious and for $42 scarf
it better reloads your hip so I got all
three of these they were the box is $36
and this is their accessories box I've
never tried their makeup box that I've
seen other videos of them coffee break
with Danny who's one of my favorite
youtubers
she had a I think she might have gotten
the holiday box it was like a mixture
but they have very high-end makeup as
well so I'll link this below if you're
interested they did send me this for
free but I'm being honest with you I
really like it I actually really really
do um so I think it's a pretty darn good
deal however it is $36 so you have to
keep in mind what your budget is but if
you're already doing like a couple
subscription boxes and you're thinking
I'd rather just get one or if you know
you'd rather get jewelry instead of
makeup this is a really nice one I
really like the accessories I think if I
were to subscribe to one I probably
would do the accessories just because
again it's something I already have a
lot of makeup so it's something kind of
fun to get new jewelry new scarves they
have sunglasses things like that so well
my throat really does hurt
thanks anyway I hope that was helpful
and beneficial for you guys to watch and
I will catch you guys very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
