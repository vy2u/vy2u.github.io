you remember back in I want to well it
was in the winter I would eat there
December of January sometime in there I
reviewed a makeup box at theirs and then
also an accessories box well they sent
another one this month and it was the
accessories box which is typically
jewelry and scarves and sunglasses and
just things you know accessory stuff now
at once upon and you get to choose
between the makeup one the jewelry one
or the intimates one which is like
camisoles and undergarments things like
that I've never tried that one but the
accessories one I have tried the one
thing that I really really like about
this one is that their process of
choosing what they're going to send you
is really detailed and that when you
sign up you take a survey and like for
example for the jewelry you choose if
whether it'll say okay when it comes to
bracelets bangles do you love like or
hate them and anything that you choose
that you hate or dislike or whatever
they're wordage is they never ever send
you so for example I really don't need
these scarves so I ended up choosing
dislike or hate or whatever for scarfs
so they didn't send me any and I don't
need any sunglasses so I clicked dislike
for that so I know that if you're
spending $36 a month which is a lot of
money I mean especially in the realm of
the beauty box subscriptions things like
that I know that everything I'm getting
is something that I actually kind of
want to get so I'm really excited to see
what's in here I have it opened yet so I
really excited um yes so let's se llaman
I can't get it open
ooh it says packed especially for
Jessica Murphy makes me feel just a
little bit more special so it's got a
list of the things in here let's oh okay
so it's all jewelry items and oh my gosh
let's just dig right in the first thing
I see is this pair of stud earrings now
these are really cute turquoise with
that silver around them now I love studs
and I remember taking on that survey
that I chose I think out of all the
earrings like dangly and stuff I
actually wouldn't yeah where he said
today I
almost always wearing ties um I think I
said love-love-love on stud earrings and
maybe dislike all the other earrings
because I knew I'm like I wear studs
more than anything to me they're
practical and I own dangly earrings you
can see them back on that little tree
there I own plenty but I always end up
grabbing for these and if you're curious
about how I store my stud earrings I
just kind of well in my head I invented
it because I've never seen anyone else
do it but other people might do it I
invented a new way to store stud earring
so you can see all of them and I'm very
excited about it so if you're interested
in that let me know I can do an
organizational video on my jewelry
anyway so really excited about these let
me see if I can find the price for these
this must be it the Lybia earrings and
these cost 14 dollars in retail really
cute the next thing I see is another
pair of studs and these are this really
cute like tan color and these must be if
those are the livia these must be the
Tesla earrings and these run for $12
retail again really like um I like that
I've got some with silver and some with
gold so I can you know makes a match
with different outfits oh I'm excited
the next thing I see that's why the main
reason I smiled when I first opened this
that I could see is this well I'm
assuming it's a bracelet it's called
their Sandi bracelet and it's this
bracelet that can be wound around three
times but you can also wear it as a
necklace I would bet yeah so I just
thought that was cool and I love that
there's three different colors involved
in it so it just it really kind of goes
with any outfit I'm gonna wear the heck
out of this thing and I like that it's
adjustable because for me if you've got
the small wrist it's really hard to find
bracelets that don't bang around all
over you I hate that no really I feel
like bangles bang around on a lot of
people whether you think you have small
wrist or not don't you feel that way
that you're just all over the place I'm
like duh so I'm really excited about
this this runs for $26 retail this does
feel really really well-made I will say
so excited about that the last thing in
here and this one retails for $29 each
Lisa came in like this little velour bag
that's so classy okay it's a statement
necklace
oh yeah so this is called the Johnny or
Joanie necklace and it's just got these
beautiful cream-colored stones with like
that little marble eyes finished and
some of them this is fun and I really
like like you know I'm a teacher and a
lot of times I want to wear stuff like
this but if it's a crazy color I'm just
not gonna wear it as much as I would
wear something that's more muted like
this so I really really like this again
it feels really well made so that was a
win so with the two pair of earrings
with the first one running for $14 then
$12 for the other pair the bracelet was
26 and the necklace was $29 that totals
to 81 dollars in retail value and the
box cost 36 so I certainly worth your
money now if you are someone that you're
just fine with getting you know
necklaces and jewelry from you know a
lot cheaper from you know forever 21 or
anywhere like that then this might not
be the box for you because this is
certainly you know had they not sent it
to me would I buy it I think right now
my budget wouldn't call for it that's
one of those things you have to be
conscious of I mean you guys know this
but if you don't make a ton of money or
it's just not in your budget 36 dollars
just a big chunk of money but if you're
someone that does have more expendable
income and you're wanting a way to kind
of supplement your jewelry collection I
think this is an awesome box it just is
pricey so that's something to keep in
mind I'm keeping it real with you guys
but I ran I literally love everything
this came with the last accessories box
I really liked everything but I got like
a scarf and a few other things and I
don't know I I remember liking it but
feeling like it but this I love
everything so again going back to their
survey process I think that's really
really spot-on
I wish every makeup box or any sort of
box would do it that particular Lea that
did make sense you guys know to me
anyway so I hope that was helpful for
you guys and I'll catch you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
