unboxing video for you all want a bowl
was nice enough to send me their makeup
box for January 2014 and I figured
obviously I would share it with you guys
let you know kind of what my thoughts
are on it one suppose a month and they
have three different options for what
you can pick for your box they have a
makeup box which is what I have today I
previously gotten an accessories box
from them which is usually jewelry
scarves sunglasses things like that
which you I can link it below I think it
was December yeah I think it was last
month I got there is that right yeah
their accessories box
I loved it some of my favorite I got a
pair of earrings that I loved in a
necklace I'm well so you'll just have
that you'll just have to watch that
video but so they were kind enough to
send me the makeup one which I'm really
excited because I have not received
their makeup box before so looks like
this I think the last one I got was
white oh I didn't even tell you duh the
third box is an intimate box where you
get I think things like camisole
undergarments things like that and of
course these it's a monthly subscription
service you get a new box each month so
this is the makeup one wow I said that
sometimes so it says hello
knock out why thank you don't make me
blush so it's got some padding there so
you protect it okay so what oh it's
saying there's a wantable
app in the App Store and then it always
comes with a breakdown of what you
received now what I really do like about
wantable is that they're you know how a
lot of these makeup subscription
services have a quiz that you take just
so they can get idea of your skin type
your skin tone things like that so they
don't send you products that don't match
you at all which still sometimes happens
you know but this one their process is
really in-depth and I remember even for
the accessories box with jewelry it
would ask like do you like mixed mixed
metals do you like rope or like leather
on your bracelets or not and so
basically you choose if you loved it
like it or dislike it if you ever say
you dislike a certain thing your you
won't
even if you say you love something
you're more likely to receive if you say
you liked you might receive it you might
not so for example I checked for dislike
I said that I wondered now I want to
check with it I said I wouldn't want a
highlighter a nail polish a lash product
or eyeliner and I don't think I got any
of those things and I think I'm sure
those were all things that I have a lot
of mascara so I didn't want another
mascara things like that I have a lot of
eyeliners I didn't want another so since
I said I dislike those those will not be
in any box that I received so I thought
that was really really a smart way to do
that that way if you're someone that has
a lot of lipstick you can say dislike on
lipstick so you won't receive any of
course I love lipstick and I rightfully
I mean I have a lot but I don't have as
much of a range as I would like
especially since I do videos so that was
something I was hoping to get anyway so
then it breaks down the different things
they send you in the retail so I'll be
sure to tell you the retail Wow I've
talked a lot sorry you guys
okay so the first thing is this billion
dollar brow brow gel this is kind of
funny because I just recently received
brow gel from a friend of mine actually
two different ones it's just funny but I
actually really do like brow gel so and
I've never tried to need a billion
dollar brow products so this is their
clear brow gel and it retails for $18
ooh this packaging is baller it's like
mattified if you can tell and it's like
a little torpedo let's look at the brush
it's got a longer brush and it's clear I
mean I can't really tell you yet I can't
testify to the quality of it but I'll be
sure to find this out I'll be sure to
try this out soon so I can let you guys
know but it's full size which I
appreciate like I said it retails for
$18 which is insane
but okay so the next thing is the one
stick in flustered this is funny I've
received this before in another
subscription service I don't remember
which one I want to say it was if see
but it might have been boxycharm I
should know that if it might have been
Birchbox I have no idea I've received
this before though and actually I think
I gave it to a friend of mine it's in
the same shade as well now this retails
for $16 and it's this is marketed as a
cheek a lip you can
do whatever you want with it it's a
cream product of course that's how it
comes off just straight up let's see
what it looks like blended out like if I
were to put this on my cheeks I think if
you applied it maybe lighter than what I
did it would be really nice it's a
little harsh but I'm sure it would be
really nice on the lips and maybe maybe
it's a sign I gave my other one away
maybe I should actually keep this one
and give it a try maybe it maybe it is a
sign that I am supposed to use this
product I really do like the packaging
though and any be a bombshell product
that I've tried I have light I really
like their eyeshadows especially in
their lip crayon so I'm actually gonna
give this a try this time but it retails
for 16 so so far 18 and 16 is what 2034
so already with these two we basically
made our money back because it was $36
and that's 34 right there the next thing
what is this this is is this the one no
this is what okay this is the brand skin
SK iin and I hate packaging like this
but if it's a really good product then I
guess I won't matter so the skin instant
skin tightener and line filler sampler
this actually seems interesting because
I don't know if it's supposed to be like
a primer skin tightener and line filler
if it's just a moisturizer or if it's a
primer or maybe it's both it has an
expiration date on of course it's like
two years from now but I'm actually kind
of excited to give it a try and I
haven't tried any skin products before
so I'll let you know how I like that and
the good news is I'd rather have this
packaging then in like a little packet
where you rip it open because at least
with this I can still close it again so
I appreciate that at least alright and
that one doesn't have a retail value so
that was just like an extra thrown in
thing now this brush hmm it's Michael
Marcus which I've heard of Michael
Marcus and I've heard it's actually
really high-quality really nice products
this is their prime foundation brush and
it's $20 I just received a foundation
brush in the was it boxes yarn you guys
might be able to love you know better
than yeah and that's sterile oh there's
so many boxes out there and all of them
are really good
it's just amazing they all kind of run
together in my head with the things I
get I just got a foundation brush and I
asked you guys like what like I don't
apply foundation with this now I will
say this on the actual brush it says
prime brush I'd be interested to use
this for primer and see how it works
because I never use this kind of brush
for foundation I just don't a lot of you
recommended to apply masks with it which
I thought was a great idea so I might
try it for that because then you can
apply it evenly without getting the mask
all over your hands and you know you
evenly got it you can get into those
like crevices like you know your where
your nasolabial fold meets your nose
anyway so I'm excited to try this for
that I might try it with primer too if
that actually is what it's supposed to
be used for that might be really nice
maybe it will be nice to apply this so
definitely gonna give that a try that
retails for twenty-two no twenty dollars
so that's what that was 34 so $54 so far
yes yes yes okay this is the last thing
and this is the best samay which means
kiss me in Spanish miss ma cosmetics
classic color lipstick how appropriate
that it means kiss me first of all the
box is adorable what color is it in I'm
trying to see if it's set oh this comes
in a little velvet bag oh my gosh and it
says base ma on it and it's the 1955
lipstick an exotic pink now this retails
for $22 so it's more than a MAC lipstick
or anything like oh my gosh this
packaging is adorable it's real like
heavier metal kind of you know what I
mean okay look at that bright pink color
huh I'm about to rock this in some
videos you guys I probably I don't know
if I wear it in real life
I really don't wear like the lipstick
I'm wearing today I usually don't wear
when I'm out and about maybe sometimes
but this oh I love this color and I
think it's a very it's a kind of a fun
shape it's a little bit different can
you tell how it's a different shape than
most lipsticks it's like the same on
both sides this is gorgeous in the
packaging I can't get over it with the
loot bag so that retails for 22 so that
was 54
sixty seventy seventy six dollars worth
of products plus you got the extra one
for free you know there was no retail
value and it cost $36 you really I mean
obviously you can't beat it for its
value and I think if you have a lot of
makeup or you like higher-end makeup and
you don't want a lot of drugstore
products now I love me some drugstore
products but if you like higher in
makeup and you want it box that kind of
caters to you in that way this would be
a better option for you
you know if you don't have thirty six
dollars to spend then that's different
you know and I'm sure that you can
cancel this at any time you could get a
month and then not get the next month
and things like that but those types of
things you just always want to be on top
of your games so that way you don't
accidentally so but I really I think the
product I'm most excited about is this
and the brow gel for sure but I think
they were all pretty good the brush I'm
just gonna see how I end up using it in
my little brush collection there but
anyway so thank you to wanna bowl for
sending that to me for free I hope that
was helpful for you guys and your search
for the perfect subscription service box
cuz there's so many but I will
definitely link it down below if you are
interested and I'll catch you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
