be testing out some waterproof drugstore
makeup to see if they're actually
waterproof so I'm going to show you what
makeup I've applied for this look today
it's a really simple look I wanted to
see what makeup actually withstands the
water so these are all drugstore
products I love everything listed and
linked below as well as their prices if
you're interested and we'll see at the
end after I do the water test which
one's actually lasted and which ones did
not okay so the first thing I'm going to
use this is one that I have a couple
products that aren't waterproof I could
not find any true waterproof version of
like three or four of these items the
rest say waterproof so this is one that
it didn't say waterproof it's the
covergirl outlast all-day primer and it
was just saying that it's supposed to
keep your makeup looking fresh all day
so I figured that's one eye I'm
interested to try out so it's just kind
of a lotion like texture next I'm going
to use the Revlon Colorstay makeup this
is for normal to dry skin and it's got
SPF of 20 and they finally have a pump
now but again this is one that it didn't
say it's waterproof I couldn't find one
but it does say it's supposed to last
all day you know 24-hour wear so I
figured this would be a good one to test
out and it's really easy to find
you
next item is supposedly waterproof this
is the Knicks gotcha Covered concealer
and it literally says waterproof on it I
got it in the shade light and from what
I've heard this is a really thick yeah
very very thick concealer very tacky so
I'm just going to apply a little bit
where I need it
Wow so that's got like very high
coverage next up we're going to do my
brows now this is again from NYX NYX has
a lot of waterproof things and you'll
see there's quite a few and all the
lists of all these trucks below this is
their Taemin frame tinted brow pomade
and it says right on it that it's
supposed to be waterproof so I got it in
the shade espresso I have no idea what
shade I am so we're just gonna see how
this goes
so you should know this is actually like
my first time using a brow pomade so
this was just weird to do generally my
eyebrows aren't perfect but that's okay
they never are alright so they also from
NYX have this NYX proof it they have two
different proof of products that I
purchased this is their waterproof
eyebrow primer oops see I should have
put this on beforehand how does it it's
just kind of like a sticky ball maybe
I'll still put it on though I'm going to
still put it on even though I presume if
it's a primer I was supposed to put it
on beforehand and I'm just going to take
a spoolie and kind of brush it through I
think the idea is that it's going to
keep your brow hairs in place while
you're swimming or whatever next up I'm
going to powder my face this is one of
the only other few ones that did not say
waterproof I think the rest are so this
is the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte and
this is one that's supposed to work for
16 hours so I figure you know powders
not a necessity for me because I don't
have super oily skin but I figure it'd
be nice to try one out anyway because I
know a lot of other people do use powder
so I'm just kind of using a fluffy brush
just putting it all over the place just
adding extra coverage everywhere for
this look just because I want to see how
well it does next up we're going to
throw on some bronzer this is the Rimmel
natural bronzer and it says it is
waterproof which I was excited to see a
powder that's claims to be waterproof
this is in the shade 20 sunshine they
had a couple shade options so I'm just
gonna get it's got a little bit of
shimmer to it I'm just gonna kind of
bronze up this area kind of like a
bronzing contour type in one it's kind
of what I've been doing lately anyway
moving on from there the next thing
we're going to do is blush now for this
I'm using a NYX cream blush I couldn't
find waterproof blush when I was I was
at Ulta yesterday buying all this stuff
but I thought about my NYX cream blushes
and how they're like one of the few
blushes I own that don't move
period and when it comes to sweating and
swimming cream products really can be
great for that
okay we're also going to throw on a
highlighter this is another one that it
I think I did I couldn't find a
waterproof highlighter and the reality
is if you're swimming odds are you're
not going to be putting all of these
products on but I did want to try one
from every category this one didn't say
waterproof but it's a cream highlighter
that I hadn't tried but I think cream
highlighters are going to do again
they're going to probably stay longer
than any powder would when it comes to
swimming and water so this is the True
Match Lumi liquid glow illuminator and
it's an ice gloss a I'm just going to
put a little bit on my arm or on my hand
kind of rub it in and then you take a
little brush just to throw a little bit
okay so face wise we're done we're going
to go ahead and move on to our eyes I
have this NYX proof it eyes shadow
primer so this is not the same as the
eyebrow primer this is eye shadow so
it's just a little doe foot I've never
tried this one either I'm just going to
get a little bit all we're going to use
for this look is this L'Oreal infallible
shadow I know also that the color
tattoos from Maybelline are awesome they
are waterproof I can tell you that just
from swatches on my hand and watching my
hand over and over again and it not
going anywhere but I wanted to try one
of these powder formulas just to see how
old are these stay up because these I've
never personally tested so this is the
L'Oreal infallible shadow in amber rush
this is beautiful golden kind of rose
gold shade I'm just going to use my
finger to apply it and then blend out
the the edges of it with a brush
so just kind of a one shadow look really
easy next up is I have two different
waterproof liners I'm going to try them
both out kind of together so one of them
this is the Rimmel scandaleyes
waterproof gel eyeliner up to 24 hour
where it says it's waterproof the other
one I picked up was from essence and
it's their eyeliner pen and waterproof I
actually use this last night it was
awesome so we're going to use both and
just see how they do I usually use both
a gel liner and a liquid liner anyway
because I'll kind of do a thicker line
with the gel liner and then I'll use a
liquid liner to kind of do the wing and
make that and just kind of go over it to
make it look a little bit more crisp and
I'm just going to go ahead and use the
brush that the Rimmel one comes with
so I finished with the gel liner and I
kind of I also just kind of add it in
filled in like my um right near my
lashline so now I'm going to go over it
with the essence one just to see how
especially if I've got a wing will the
wing actually stay we're going to find
out I'm very intrigued
I think with eyeliner if you really are
big on eyeliner and you know when you're
going swimming that you that's one of
the things that you want to wear it
might be safer to layer on two different
things that are waterproof that way it's
a little bit of it runs you clean it up
you still have a decent amount so on
that's why I wear more than one kind of
eyeliner throughout the day just because
I like it to stay in place and if a
little bit wears off it's usually not
very obvious at all if you have both a
cream liner and a liquid liner you know
or whatever it is so I know most of us
do not wear more than one eyeliner in
time but it really is a great way to
make sure that it stays on all day okay
so we are done with that portion we need
to do underneath our eyes I was thinking
liner wise I'm going to take this and
just put a little bit underneath my eye
because I think it just kind of be fun
and summery and pretty but I also I'm
curious again will it stay even if it's
down there so I'm just going to take
kind of a smaller brush get a little bit
on the brush and just kind of get it
under there it's not going to be super
obvious I don't think but just going to
be pretty I think so for mascara I'm
using the covergirl LashBlast volume
waterproof I had asked you guys on
snapchat for your recommendations and a
lot of you guys recommended a lot of
this stuff but a lot of you guys mascara
wise recommended this one so I was very
excited to try it I've never I remember
trying the lash blast when it first came
out I didn't love it but I don't feel
like I gave it a fair shot and it was a
while ago let me actually rush through
my lashes first and just make sure
there's no clumps or anything weird
does anyone else when you're watching
like a tutorial or anything like that
you're like oh my gosh I can't wait to
do this look it looks so beautiful
and then at the very end they put on
eyelashes and that's what make it makes
it look awesome and you're like dang it
because like for me I'm like in my
everyday life I just it's just not who I
am to wear fake eyelashes I've talked
before where I used to wear them a lot
and like show choir and things like that
and back in high school my gosh like 10
years ago
that's crazy um anyway and it's just
funny to see people wear them everyday
I'm like oh and they look amazing I'm
not knocking people I know a lot of you
guys where I lives every day but I'm
I'm honestly just jealous cuz I'm like I
just don't have the patience to wear
them every day I just can't do it
so I'm jealous oh those of you that you
find the patience to get really good at
them and to enjoy wearing them
throughout the day because for me I just
can't do it
so we're done with the look except for
the lips this is the lip product I'll be
using for this it's the NYX full
throttle lipstick that was another
suggestion from you guys it does say
waterproof on it so this isn't the shade
sidekick oh it's got kind of an
interesting shape to it I thought about
getting like a like a bright red one of
these for this video but I kind of
figured most of us aren't gonna wear a
bright red lipstick to go swimming so
this was a little more practical where
you know it's a shade you actually might
wear while swimming because it's not
going to be super obvious but you're
still gonna feel won't put together I
mean most of us aren't going to go with
the full face of makeup swimming anyway
but it's fun for the test that's a
little tiny bit of transfer but not a
lot and I'm sure after a couple minutes
and it kind of like dries on it it'll be
like done so then we're going to do this
test in the water and see what happens
okay so I actually put the lipstick on
my hand as well because I was just
curious since it is my lip color it's
gonna be really hard to see so I wanted
to see how will it do even just on my
hand it's been on there for like
probably 20 minutes now so it should be
set so I'm really nervous I was just
telling my husband he was focusing for
me and I was like listen once I get wet
there's no turning back
well my memory
multipass I can't wait to see you naked
lasted okay so I just got back um so
what I realized I just had to pat dry my
face because of course there was water
all over it
what I realized let's just start with
the lips I had it on my hand as well I
told you so because I didn't feel like
it would show up very well
um whether or not it wore off even just
looking at this it didn't move like it's
the exact same as it was um it's it's
kind of a drying formula but it's not so
drying that it's driving me nuts but I
wonder if it'd been a darker color if it
would have been more obvious how dry it
is so this is not a lip product I would
recommend just all the time but if you
are swimming and you do want something I
mean it stayed in place I don't think
it's Satan places while on this but I
had change and stuff so I feel like like
after I was changing back into regular
clothes that it smeared it so but it
still stay to UM the foundation stayed
beautifully you can still see the
bronzer like where the glimmer and stuff
was you can still see that um the brows
really stay the blush stayed on you guys
see that
and the highlight you can see where the
highlight is you can see the blush and I
kind of ended up putting the highlight
even just on top of my blush so it all
stayed in place as well the concealer
concealer stayed to you guys I am so
impressed now I also am noticing I'm
still pretty mattified so I feel like
either the foundation or the powder
really held on to the you know it stayed
true to its finish it stayed a matte
finish so that was impressive because I
thought I'm gonna get out of the shower
and maybe the blush will still be there
maybe the eyes will still be there but I
figured my face would just be kind of
like oily and you know a lot of my
freckles coming back through but it
really it looks like I remembered it
looking just a little bit ago let's talk
about the eyes I was so impressed so
impressed because when I had been um I
don't remember what my scare had been
using and it ran all over the place but
this one did not budge even on my bottom
lashes it's exactly as it was in the
infallible eyeshadow and amber
ruch looks stunning and it even stayed
down here where I had placed it and that
I thought for sure would be gone because
my eyes were burning you know and I my
eyes always burn when I get in water
whether I had no makeup on or maker so
that's just me but um that was
impressive and look at the eyeliner do
you guys see the wing it did not budge I
was so impressed even like the cream
eyeliner I put it like on my waterline
above my eye that is still intact
so I'm um I'm like trying to find
something that didn't really work but I
feel like everything really truly did
and I am so impressed when I walked out
my husband was sitting on the couch I'm
like Tyler literally everything stayed
on and he was like are you serious
cuz he's been with me at the pole enough
to know that like I usually have mascara
running everywhere and I'm like why did
I even put mascara on today so oh my
gosh I want all of these products I
tried down below I think I feel really
impressed that the blush and the
highlight stayed because they weren't
even listed as waterproof and yet they
really were the reason I'm impressed
that the infallible shadow stayed down
here was because I used that NYX proof
it waterproof eye shadow primer up here
but I didn't use it there so the fact
that the infallible shadow still stayed
when the water is just beating down on
me that impressed me because that means
it wasn't just that primer now I have a
feeling that primer really helped and
I'd be interested to try that same
primer with just regular eyeshadows to
see if it really does make it waterproof
or not if you have any suggestions for
future waterproof testing or just
testing out different makeup ideas for
videos did any of that make sense if you
have any ideas for videos or I'm testing
out different things whether it's
waterproof maybe drugstore maybe
high-end maybe the two versus each other
let me know I would love to do those I
enjoy watching these kinds of videos so
they're fun for me to make as well I
hope that you'll stick around and catch
some of my other videos I do a lot of
drugstore here I love doing Dollar Tree
makeup finds and just other dupes that I
found that aren't necessarily listed as
any other dupe on any other website ones
that I've come up with on my own
I love finding those for you guys so I
will link my dupe videos as well I hope
you'll subscribe to catch more of my
stuff and I'll see you guys in my next
one
