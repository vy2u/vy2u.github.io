have a weekly favourites video for you
and I know you're probably thinking why
would she be posting a weekly favorites
video on a Monday but I got to thinking
about it and I was like you know I want
to start doing weekly favorites and most
people do them on Fridays and so I
thought while I should do not Friday but
then I thought I thought about how like
you know I watch the weekly favorites
videos of people our Friday favorite
sort of you're on call it and I'm like
oh my god now I've watched them all over
the weekend I watch all of them from
Friday and then I gotta go the whole
week without any weekly favorites so I
thought wouldn't it be fun if one of us
posted them on a different day so then
you can be watching weekly favorites
videos all week long so here we go um
also one thing before I get started on
my weekly favorites um if you are
enjoying these videos please subscribe
so that I know you are and if you're not
then don't subscribe because then you're
gonna be getting updates of all the
videos and you're not gonna want to
watch them because you don't even like
me anyway so anyway but if you are
please subscribe that would be great and
if you don't know what subscribed means
I know that I was so confused when I
first started watching youtube videos
about what people met like I could see
the subscribe button but I was like what
does it mean to subscribe basically all
it means is that you once you subscribe
to someone that means that their stuff
you can see like their name you can
easily access their channel on like the
sidebar on your page but also you'll be
getting like in your newsfeed on your
youtube homepage any new videos that I
post you would be able to see easily and
click on easily that's all that means
so if you are enjoying them subscribe
okay I'll stop okay weekly there its
first thing oh man I've been loving this
this is the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa
butter for soft glowing lips and oh my
gosh this past weekend I was outside for
a long time my lips got so wind chapped
cuz I had nothing on them and I didn't
have anything with me and I swear to you
this you know that feeling of wind chop
you like this is gonna take forever to
heal like it just feels terrible this
stuff I swear healed my lips in like a
day like my lips are totally back to
normal they feel great and this stuff it
says for soft glowing lips and I'm not
kidding you when I say my lips feel like
they're glowing when I'm wearing it
is amazing I love this product these are
really inexpensive at the drugstore and
they're really tiny so they're so cute
okay another favorite I just recently
hauled the Milani baked blush it's in
Luminoso so it's like this really pretty
like light peach shade incredibly
pigmented I'm wearing it today I just
like it's such a fresh fresh fresh color
for spring and I know that's so cliche
but it's true and you know fresh flowers
fresh faces right so I love this it
stays on all day be careful with how
much you have on your brush because it
is incredibly pigmented okay another
thing I've been loving is the got to be
powder full volumizing styling powder it
just it's a little thing you just get
some of the powder out there okay a
little bit came out and the way I apply
it I used to just shake it right into my
roots but then it would look all crazy
and white what I do with it now in my
hand rub it together flip my head under
and get at the roots or even with my
head straight up just get my fingers in
there and put it in the roots and you
can just kind of rejuvenate it
throughout the day or throughout the
night I'm just by rubbing your fingers
it just kind of reactivates it it's
great it's like $4 it's like the best
secret that no one knows about but now
all of you know about and if you already
know about it then it was never a secret
in the first place okay so another thing
o rediscovery the maybelline instant age
rewind but this isn't one of the
concealer shades I have some of those
and I love those but this is in number
60 brightener so it's like almost a pink
tone shade and I actually have some
already just washed on here
right there you can barely see it but
it's just what I the way I apply it I
apply it here like over my concealer I
apply it here and then see got a little
bit on there that's alright lens right
in and then out and then you can blend
it with your fingers with a Beauty
Blender with a brush whatever it is just
get it to sink into your skin and it's
just so beautiful you've got a built-in
highlight without you know you put it on
before you put on your blush contour
whatever you don't even need a highlight
most of the time if I use this I don't
need like a powder on top it just looks
so nice and these don't I even noticed
any creasing and they're just so
moisturizing I love the way they melt
into your skin another thing I've been
loving is this Rimmel scandaleyes it's
their waterproof kohl eyeliner
it's in the shade noon and I have it's
washed here actually right there it's
just what I use it for is in my
waterline instead of a stark white if
I'm not wanting such a dramatically
white and basically what that does if
you've never heard of anyone doing that
by putting a light color like white or
like a nude on your waterline it meshes
in especially from like at least this
distance it meshes in with the whites of
your eyes and makes your eyes appear
bigger so instead of looking like this
that bottom part now looks extended you
know what I'm saying but by using the
white it really is you know up close it
looks a little crazy so you know for
everyday this is great it it stays on it
says waterproof I really believe that
it's waterproof now I don't think it
would last Nestor like 15 hours but I've
noticed it lasting quite a while I've
never really had to reapply it
throughout the day love it it's like
four dollars its Rimmel I just love it
okay another eyeliner but this one's in
black this is the Jordana fabula nur and
this is one I've had this forever and
it's doesn't run out and there's a
swatch of it I just love it it's a
liquid eyeliner like pen and it's it's a
firm pen if you know what I mean it's
not like flexible but what I like you
can create a really thin line you can
create a really thick line let me see if
I can give a good example well that's
like an extreme example but there you go
love that but what I love most of all is
I've literally had this for like ten
months and it is still that dark look
how dark that is and what I used it for
I don't really ever use it alone I
usually use it on top of my cream or my
gel eyeliner just to really blackened up
or darken that line - really and you can
be very precise with it so you can get
in between lashes and this is like three
dollars or something like that so cheap
I found mine at Kmart I've heard that
Jordana's as sold at I've seen it at
Walgreens I think - so yeah but I love
it and the thing is the first month of
owning this it wasn't this dark I was
like what is all the fuss about this
about cuz it was like so like watery but
I let it just sit in my vanity and then
when I pulled it back out it was like
this and it's been like this for months
and months a month it's insane I love it
another thing I recently hauled this
color whisperer maybelline color whisper
and it's in lust for blush I'm wearing
it today
I just like it it's no fuss I know I say
no fuss about a lot of lip colors but
that's kind of the way I roll with lip
colors so usually if I'm loving it it's
probably just like a no-fuss kind of
neutrally shade or maybe nothing too
bright that I do wear bright colors and
I have some bright lipsticks but they're
for very special occasions I can't
since I'm training to be a teacher it
just it's a little crazy to be wearing a
bright red bright color I don't know
that's just me though and maybe I'll
change my mind I don't know anyway I
love this shade I'm definitely planning
on trying some more these because these
are very moisturizing if you haven't
tried one yet definitely give them a try
they're lovely and then the last thing
is this dove visible care oh my gosh
this stuff will change your skin I'm not
even kidding you I've been using this
for about a year now I started using it
last summer so it says that it visibly
enhance the skin's beauty in one week
and absolutely I believe it I used to
get those little bumps you know like on
my legs and on my arms up here when I
was well before I started using this
basically and I swear to you I haven't
seen those types of bumps at all like
since I started using this they they
were gone and I never saw him again
it is the coolest thing this stuff is
amazing it's the one that's toning with
vitamin E as you can see that I know
they have a few different kinds that all
look like this is the one with the green
I'm telling you you will love it and if
you don't well we all have different
skin but I really do love it it lathers
well I've you know I've only gone
through two of these in like a year
isn't that crazy
but you only need a little bit and it
lathers like crazy and it's got vitamin
E in it and I just just love it so I
definitely recommend this especially if
you're suffering from just dry skin or
uneven skin tone that's the other thing
you said uneven skin tone on my arms not
anymore this stuff is amazing so
definitely go purchase it and let me
know what you think of it okay well
that's all and I will see you again very
soon
and please subscribe if you enjoyed it
