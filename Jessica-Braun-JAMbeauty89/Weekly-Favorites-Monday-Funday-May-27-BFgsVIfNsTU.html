favourites video and I've entitled these
from the past I called them Monday fun
day videos because it is Monday when I'm
filming this hopefully it will be
actually uploaded on a Monday but we'll
see and someone on Instagram had
actually mentioned like yesterday I
think they said you know whatever
happened to your weekly favourites
videos and I realized oh my gosh I did
one and then like I forgot to do them
again stuff if the lighting is weird
that's because I'm using artificial
lighting and not very good lighting so
gotta take what you can get but I wanted
to film a video on its night time so
what can you do and actually it's not
even that late but it's really stormy
out so it's like crazy dark and I feel
like every time I film videos it's
storming out but oh my gosh I'm
blabbering what else is new anyway so
here we go weekly favourites there are
five things I'm going to talk about that
I've been loving so first thing that I
keep reaching for is this wet and wild
palette and I'm gonna see if I can find
it online and link it below I'm not
gonna guarantee that I can but if I do
I'll put a link but this is the sparkle
till morning palette and it has eight
different shades and these are around
five dollars in stores I'm not sure how
much it will actually be online but it
has these beautiful lighter colors here
this amazing light teal color and then
just all these kind of Browns and
neutrals it's so cool and then this pop
of turquoise but I've been using these
two colors a lot and I absolutely love
them I'm wearing some of them on my eyes
today and they're just so beautiful and
of course they're so incredibly
pigmented I'm gonna actually swatch
these two that I really like that are
here at the top here for you guys
they're just so pretty I've really been
wearing them a lot I'm not sure how well
that'll show up with this funky lighting
that I was talking about it's so bad you
guys you have no idea um there I go
licking my eyeshadow off my finger again
I'm such a class act I mean come on okay
in case you were wondering
silly Jessica's back today I am so tired
and it's been a long weekend and it's
Memorial Day but I had to work today so
it's like you just like worn out it's
been like barbecue central all weekend
and my
I'm just tired I'm ready to go to bed
you guys and my throat feel like I'm
losing my voice
okay so another thing I've been loving
is this wet and wild color icon bronzer
and I put that in quotes because it's
actually more of a highlighter I think
for really any skin tone it's in the
shade reserve your Cabana and it's this
it's not too shimmery what's so cool
about it it's just not very shimmery but
it's just shimmery enough that I'm gonna
go ahead and put this on it's not so
sure Marie that it looks you look like a
disco ball you know it's just enough
that it's a lighter color it really does
highlight that area without making it
look weird and what's great about this
it has SPF which is nice but I mean
you're putting SPF just on that area so
if you don't have it anywhere else and
it's not really doing much but what's
nice about it is that in the summer you
know when the sun shining on you you
don't want like a strip or even like a
little area of like glitter you want it
to be nice and kind of uniform and to
look like it's lighter in that area like
the lights hitting it so this is
wonderful for that so and I think this
is like 399 I got mine at I want to say
Walgreens or CVS but you ever want I'm
not sure um okay another thing this is
more higher-end that I've been loving
and I instagrammed about this it's the
Lancome Hypnose star and this is a trial
size and so the brush I mean the brush
is still like a full size brush it has
this like it goes to kind of a point
which is hard to tell but it's almost
like a cone shape and that point this
last half over here is so good for the
bottom lashes it's wonderful and what's
so nice about this is that it really
wears beautifully throughout the day it
it stays on and doesn't like cool it
doesn't Club but it also doesn't kind of
leave flakes all over your skin and I've
been using this for about two or three
weeks now and I have been loving it and
it scares me because it's expensive and
I don't want to have to buy this but
I've tried like the Lancome Hypnose
mascara and also the Hypnose drama is
that it's called yeah I tried both of
those like the full size and I would
repurchase those in the past but they're
so expensive for what they are and you
know I found drugstore versions that I
liked better but for this
oh man it reminds me of the rocket look
better and it stays on longer and it
holds your curl I love it and this isn't
even waterproof it's just like
straight-up
awesome and I'm not it's in the shade
black I'm assuming I don't see like the
actual name oh it's a noir midnight so
awesome another thing I've been loving
is this NYX mega shine lip glosses in
the shade sugarpie and I'm wearing it
today although you probably can't really
tell because it's just like a nice gloss
it really doesn't have much color it's
more of a neutral shade but it's just
like I'm gonna put some more on right
now it's just like it's great for like
if you have a color or a lipstick or a
lip shade that's either too dark for you
or too bright for you this is awesome at
muting that color or kind of toning it
down without having to just not wear it
at all you know what I mean you end up
spending money on something and you're
like oh no like this is a terrible shade
for me but you want to keep it this is
great for kind of making it work and
this is also great for just putting in
the mil of bottom lip just to kind of
add dimension to your lips I'm just
highlighting that area this is great for
it so it's in the shade sugarpie it's
around $5 at Ulta I can try and link it
below as well and it does smell like
cherries so if you're not a big fan of
cherries then just stay away cuz you
will hate this but if you don't mind the
smaller if you like cherries then you'll
love it last thing is the elf High
Definition powder but it is in the shade
yellow no corrective yellow and I'm just
realizing sorry about my nails all of
them are painted but my pointer finger
which is hilarious I end up usually what
happens is this these chip first and
then I end up just like taking the nail
polish off like it starts chipping off
so I just like peel it off and then and
my boyfriend Tyler always makes funny
because he's like your pointer fingers
are always missing like there's never
any look I know and actually I was just
gonna put glitter on it on the go like I
in my what's in my purse video which
I'll link somewhere around me I always
talk about how I do use glitter polish
to just fix chipped nails or if I'm like
missing nail polish I'll just put
glitter polish on it and it'll kind of
look a little bit better but I haven't
even done that I am a mess this week
anyway
this power is in yellow and it's this
huge honkin thing but it's this yellow
colored powder I don't know if you're
gonna see it's kind of on the brush as
well but I use a small elf concealer
brush and put it on over my concealer to
set it because this is a very finely
milled powder and it's just so nice and
it is corrective and that it helps to
hide any darkness that might be left
after using concealer but it also helps
sassette that concealer that you use so
those are my five favorite products of
the week I'm loving them loving them
loving them I recommend them if you
enjoyed please subscribe and I'll see
you guys very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
