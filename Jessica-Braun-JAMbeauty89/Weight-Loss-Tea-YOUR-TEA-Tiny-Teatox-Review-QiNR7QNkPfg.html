be talking about my new favorite tea you
guys know that I have very specific
favorite teas of mine and I've done a
few tea videos in the past a lot of you
guys have asked me for more videos about
the teas that I like and there was one
tea I've been dying to try and I'd heard
so many things that I'd seen it on
Instagram like everywhere everyone's
like talking about it so when this brand
which is called your tea contacted me I
like my heart was racing out of my chest
because I just thought the stars are
aligning like this tea I've been dying
to try and they're saying like hey would
you be willing to try a tea of ours and
perhaps do a video about it I was like
yes yes so they said you know pick out a
tea so I went on and I was like where do
you even begin like there's so many
kinds of teas they have body teas mood
teas and then within those there's a
whole bunch of teas in those different
categories so I was really overwhelmed
but I ended up going with their tiny tea
and this is the 28th day one and they
also have a 14 day one and it's called
their tea talks and so the idea is that
it's like a detoxifying type of tea now
before you freak out because I have had
so many comments any time I say that
it's a detox tea about any brands that
I've tried some people like there's no
way a tea could detoxify your body guys
I have no idea like I'm not a medical
professional I'm not I don't know
anything about it but I do know that
teas make me feel a certain way and
sometimes my body reacts in a positive
way to certainties so whether or not
it's detoxifying my body I have no idea
but I do know the way it's making me
feel so that's what I'll be talking
about of course this is my experience
and other people's experience with any
kind of tea you might be different but
let's go ahead and get into what this
tea is all about and kind of how I've
used it in my life and how it's actually
like affected my life so like I said
they have 28-day and 14 day versions of
this kind of tea and what it says I'm
gonna actually read you what they said
on the website
it says because this is why I picked
this one it says specifically designed
to assist with bloating indigestion
problematic skin cellulite reduction of
excess weight increased energy and then
it also says that it does contain gluten
they have a gluten-free version that
blew my mind I'm like gluten and my mom
actually has to eat gluten-free so it's
just interesting her so those are all of
the claims and of course you know when I
receive this I'm all excited I'm like oh
how cool and so when you open the box it
comes with this like pamphlet and in it
it's got all the different teas they
have so they have like a man tea that's
good for men a fertility fee skin tea
and that's the one I almost got but I
ended up going with this one let's go
through like the different things about
this tea so taste wise it has a very
delicate taste like it's not it's not a
spicy tea it's not it doesn't really
have a strong flavor but it does have a
little something so I just like it it's
a tea that you can drink and not feel
like you're filling up like you're
feeling full cuz some teas make me feel
like oh like water bloated you know what
I mean but it's not so delicate that you
don't taste anything it's kind of right
in between which I really like I'm not
big on really really flavored spicy teas
anyway so I was glad that these didn't
taste like that because I've had some
other teas that are detox that are very
almost spicy and I'm not a big fan of
those so that was a plus they the
instructions they give they said you can
either drink them like two to three
times a day 30 minutes before meal or
even after a meal and I typically would
do it after because I don't always know
exactly what I'm gonna be eating so it's
really hard for me to plan to drink a
cup of tea before so I've been doing it
afterwards for the most part and I've
actually only been doing it twice a day
because lunch time I'm a teacher and so
my lunch time is like always a mess and
I'm always in a rush there's no way but
dinner time and breakfast I can play in
a little more so I was able to do that
you guys I've lost like three pounds I'm
not exaggerating and I've only been
doing this for about two weeks now I
really feel like and I haven't really
changed anything diet wise or exercise
wise I'm training for the marathon but
I've been doing that for a while I lost
three pounds and I
know what else to accredit it to other
than this because this is the only thing
that's changed in my lifestyle over the
past few weeks so that's kind of blown
my mind and again you have three pounds
it doesn't seem like a lot but at the
same time that is a lot for all I'm you
know the only change I made is that I
started drinking this tea so I mean my
mind just explodes thinking about it it
is so amazing so those have been my
experiences with this tea I would
suggest if you're even thinking about
these kinds of tea and kind of going
into like almost a teen regimen when it
comes to detoxing or weight loss and
things like that look at the website and
see the prices are different of course
it's a lot less if you get a 14-day one
so if you're wanting to kind of try it
out you can go that route not all of
them are certain amount of days you can
just get a box of tea because it's not
they're not all like regimens that you
follow but I really like this I'm now
now I want to try like the skin one
because if it's amazing for your skin
they've got so many so definitely check
it out there are some that I kind of
blew up like the fertility tea
supposedly that might help with
fertility I don't know but if you were
even looking into that it certainly
might be worth looking into you know so
I thought that was really really cool I
wanted to share it with you guys
of course I'm so thankful to have done
this in collaboration with your tea I'm
was very excited that is I was very
excited so hopefully this video is
helpful for you guys and of course I
will put all the links below for this
site if you enjoy please subscribe and I
can link any tea videos I've done in the
past below I know I've done a tea haul
have I done need tea specific videos

will catch you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
