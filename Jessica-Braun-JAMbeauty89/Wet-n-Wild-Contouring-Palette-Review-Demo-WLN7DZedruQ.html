to review the wet-and-wild
contouring palette this is like three or
four dollars at Walmart I think it's
like 399 and 393 you know the Walmart
always ends in 93 cents anyway
so this is in the shade caramel or
caramel toffee and they also have dulce
de leche or dulce de leche however you
want to say it which I couldn't find at
my store you can also get them online as
well
but I'm just going to keep my eyes
peeled for it so this is the one that I
actually have this comes with a ton of
product clearly and it comes with a
highlight and contour and of course
contouring is so big right now people on
Instagram and makeup artists all over
the world are doing that really chiseled
thing this is not necessarily for that I
mean it's not crazy pigmented you can
see the swatches here they're not the
darkest richest colors in the world but
I think for everyday kind of shaping
your face I use it today and I'm going
to show you a demo here in a second this
is a great product so let's get into the
demo of me applying this you can see how
I use it how it looks when you're
actually putting it on yours okay so I'm
going to apply the contour or bronzer
well I guess they're calling it a
contour first and I'm just gonna use
this BH Cosmetics like fan brush so
let's just do grow it in here I'm gonna
start here so I'm just getting a bunch
onto the brush and then I'm kind of
dotting it down onto my towel like this
so I don't have too much and I'm just
gonna start right above the ear and just
kind of go back and forth so you can see
a little bit of color starting to get
there and you don't want to go too far
in and I don't really want to go farther
in than this then where my eyebrow ends
so I need a little bit more maybe I
don't have to dot it off I'm just gonna
so it's a really kind of faint color
which I like and it just ends up
creating like this wash of a shadow of
course if I used a really really
detailed brush I'd be able to get it
it'd be more precise but I don't usually
do like a sharp contour but you can
already see how that's sucking in that
side of my face so let's do the other
half what's nice is because this isn't
crazy pigmented you can't really screw
it up hello text message you can't
really screw it up too much and you can
always go back in with like your
foundation brush and buff away any areas
where you went too heavy-handed but like
I said I don't want to go in too far so
so then I'm just gonna lightly I'm gonna
get a little bit more and just kind of
lightly up here towards the top towards
my hairline just kind of lightly dust
this I don't really I like it cuz
there's nothing too stark or crazy and
you can always go under your jawline
just kind of I'm just doing to sloppily
a bit so for someone as fair as I am I
think this is a really nice option
because it is really I mean you can
definitely tell that I contour but it's
nothing like some of the powders I've
used are so pigmented that you touch it
and it's like your face is covered I
think I could have gone actually even
lighter especially here but now I know
so I'm going to apply a blush real fast
I'm just gonna apply let's see ah well I
need something Matt I'll do my ELF
candidly coral so I'm gonna apply that
real fast because then I want to try the
highlighter out so I love this shade
because you can't really screw it up
it's just a really pretty peach shade
and it's I don't think it has any
shimmer it's kind of well it's got kind
of a satin finish to it but if you're
fair like I am it's just nice because
you really can't screw it up too much
alright so now I'm gonna go in for the
highlight now this highlight is very
it's just a matte
highlight which is great because it's
just giving you where the light should
hit this is a furless brush I don't
really know anything about that brand I
literally just got these in the mail but
I'm just gonna kind of buff it up here
since it's not shimmery I'm not too
concerned about placement as much so I'm
just giving a bunch and just kind of
swirling it up above my cheekbone you
can even take it up where you did not
put the contour I mean you could be
really precise and just get there and
just get here but with something like
this I don't think you have to worry
about that as much just anywhere the
light would naturally hit you can kind
of place this so it's I mean I don't
think the Hilah I mean the highlight is
nice it's nice to have an option that
isn't shimmery because every highlight I
own I'm pretty sure almost every single
one has some sort of shimmery quality to
it whereas this is just a light powder
I think this would show up more if I
were even like if I were darker in any
way because then it would really lighten
that area I think it does a little bit
but I don't think it's anything to write
home about
I do however really like this contour so
that's how I have been using this
product so like I'd mentioned not the
craziest most pigmented thing but it's
absolutely buildable and what's nice is
it's kind of foolproof you can't really
screw it up and put way too much on
right right away which is really nice if
you're a beginner at makeup or you just
don't want a really strong contour I
don't like strong contours on me I'm not
a makeup artist you know that's just not
me and I'm a classroom teacher at that
so I don't want it to look you know what
I'm saying anyway so I really like this
I was so I kind of I love wet and wild
you guys know my channel like I've
mentioned before is deeply rooted in elf
and wet wild all kinds of really
inexpensive drugstore brands but I have
to admit I'm thinking when I saw this
came out I was like I don't know but I
was so pleasantly surprised not only is
it really thin so it's easy to throw in
a makeup bag and it doesn't take up a
lot of space but it's really nice
obviously I like the contour powder more
than the highlight but
highlight still does a nice job of
lightening those areas that need to be
lightened if you will so I I think this
is an amazing option and really there
are like virtually no contouring options
at the drugstore unless you just get
like a powder that's a deeper shade than
what you would wear there's not a lot so
for this to come out I was ecstatic it's
finally a cheap inexpensive drugstore
option for those that don't want to buy
a $50 honest Asya contouring palette
with a bunch of colors in it that you'll
never use because they don't work for
your skin this way they've got you know
the two different options you can pick
and choose I was so excited so overall
what I recommend of course I would and
you can't really go wrong for four
dollars you could buy it try it out if
you don't love it then pass it on to a
friend that might like it even more I
have a feeling you'll like it because
you can't really go wrong but that's
just my two cents
if you enjoyed this drugstore if you
definitely check out all of my other
really inexpensive drugstore review and
demos like this one and if you enjoyed
subscribe please and I will catch you
guys on my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
