bringing you a review of the entire wet
and wild cover all line everything
except for the powder so I've got the
primer the foundation and the concealer
and in a second I'm going to show you a
demo of me applying it to my bare face
so you can see how they look
you know based off of what my skin was
and then what it looks like with these
on that way you can really get a feel
for the coverage and the finish and
things like that now I've been using the
foundation for about a year now so I
really know how I feel about this
and then the primer and the concealer
I've had for maybe a week and a half and
I've been wearing them every single day
really to get a feel for how I feel
about them I'm actually wearing all of
this right now and then of course I've
got my other makeup on top of it so this
is the finished look with all three of
these products but let's go ahead and
get into the demo so you can see how
they look when I'm applying them okay so
I've already applied my angelou natural
serum and then my humble and lovey
restorative day cream and I've let these
kind of sink into my skin for a few
minutes and now my skin it's you know
it's not tacky everything's kind of
soaked in so now I feel ready to apply
the primer so the primer comes in a
little squeezy tube just like the
foundation does and it says cover all
primer and it says that it's a magic
potion to refine pores fill fine lines
brighten complexion and even skin tone
now I've been using this is not a first
impression video I've been using these
for a little over a week every single
day and this I've been using for like a
year I've had this for a very long time
and I've been using it and loving it
but the primer is very new to me and
I've only been using it for a week and a
half but what I've noticed is that just
so you can see the consistency the it
looks like Elmer's glue it looks like
Elmer's glue kinda not really I remember
the first time I did it like two weeks
ago I felt like it even smelled like a
bit smelling it now I don't feel like it
totally smells like but it really is
more of a lotion e primer I'm used to
with my skin using um like silicone
based type primers that are really
velvety feeling and typically
transparent
course this is transparent coot the
white fades away like any like
moisturizer would it does have a soft
feeling once it's spread out across your
skin like even right now it does feel
soft and I'm thinking that this would be
a better option for people with dry skin
like me and I think I might switch to
more primers that are more like this
that are a little more moisturizing
because you know with the silicone
primers I don't like to use them because
they really do illuminate any dryness
I've got going on right here which I do
right now I also have a few little
breakouts because of well do you want to
know what broke me out let me show you I
have a few breakouts because of this
laura geller balance and Brighton
foundation I have it in fair and it's
really pretty
but it's been breaking me out and I had
used it a long time ago like a year ago
and I noticed a breakout so I put it
away and then I pulled it back out and
sure enough I broke out again so I'm
like it's gotta be this anyway so the
primer it does feel really soft I don't
know that it necessarily brightens my
skin or blurs any imperfections on its
own because you know I've got freckles
now those aren't imperfections but you
know you can still see my freckles you
can still see kind of my little bit of
hyperpigmentation my nose is still a
little bit red so I don't necessarily
know that it brightens your complexions
are really evens your skin tone
fine lines which I do have some here I
don't notice there any less so in that
regard I don't think this is a magic
potion in that way now what I will
attest to is how it works underneath the
foundation so that's really the purposes
of this so the foundation is of course
the coverall
I found it in 815 Fair which is the
lightest one they had I had the next one
up 816 I think it's called light and I
got rid of it was it was way too dark
for my skin and I used to use it
sometimes in the summer and I used it
almost up but I was so excited to see a
lighter one so it's the same type
squeezy tube packaging it's a very
liquidy foundation and I am just gonna
kind of dot it along as we go this it
feels it looks liquidy but it's almost
kind of sticky feeling
and when you use it you'll know exactly
what I mean it really is almost a sticky
feeling
I usually just dot it on but lately I've
been spreading it out because I notice
it goes on a little more evenly I'm just
using my Real Techniques expert face
brush which I love to use it every
foundation ever so starting in the
middle and work our way up
so you can already tell now of course
this really is fair and looking at this
blended out part compared to my skin I
am a little warmer toned than this so
that is one thing but that's something
that's easily remedied by bronzer now
I'm going to do the other half of my
face you're really the other third with
my hand just to kind of see what it
looks like when you just blend it in
with your fingers because not everyone
uses brushes and sometimes brushes are
not the best option for certain
foundations so I mean it's got pretty
darn good coverage now of course I don't
have concealer on yet so that's
something that I haven't really covered
but other than that it really does cover
up a lot this does not look greasy at
all and it covers a lot now what I've
been doing ever since I've ever used
this is I always with really any
foundation I'll take a little bit more
and put it on the areas that I feel like
need a little more coverage like my
hyperpigmentation area plus that'll make
my blush look a little more seamless cuz
it's got a more blank slate to go on too
and I always put a little more on my
nose because it's always red
so I I would say brush versus hand I
don't think there's really a difference
do you guys notice the difference I feel
like it applies the same way because it
does sink into the skin really quickly
and nicely you don't feel like you're
dragging it across the skin like I said
the only thing is it is sticky as you're
applying it but once it dry its tacky
like right now it's tacky but up here
where I didn't apply anymore it's no
longer tacky so it does take a little
bit to kind of set in to your skin
before you want to put a blush or
bronzer because it's going to stick to
this tacky spots but as long as you give
it about two minutes I feel like you're
fine you could work on your brows or
something so the last thing I'm going to
try is the wet wild cover all liquid
concealer wand it comes in a wand like
this and I'm just going to apply it
where I would typically apply it this is
the lightest one they had and it is very
orange on my skintone I'll just pretend
like it's a salmon ton concealer again
I'll use the brush on one side and my
fingers on the other I'm not doing any
crazy highlight you know with some
concealers I might do that where you do
the upside down triangle but not with
this one so I'm just going to use my
foundation brush because this is great
for this as well and I'm just going to
blend it through so it worked okay um
it's not I mean it's gone honestly the
first time I use this there was like no
coverage whatsoever and I don't know
what I'd done differently now trying it
with the finger might be different so
let's just see this color looks
ridiculous before it's blended in yeah
finger is not ideal I can already see do
you see how it's watching so I'm just
going to finish it with the brush
because I don't want to have to redo it
so fingers are not ideal now we know
that for this foundation or this
concealer
it certainly is more concealed there's
certainly a little brightness to it I I
I mean I just don't think there's
anything special I think you know it's
really cheap so if you're dying to have
some sort of concealer I mean it is
really cheap I want to say it was like
$2.99 maybe and it concealed a little
bit you know I certainly look way better
than I did before so I can't complain
and this is one that
when I've used it in the mornings by the
end of the day I don't feel like it is
still concealing so that would be my
main gripe because right now it looks
pretty good really but by the end of the
day I just remember always looking at
and being like like I feel like mmm I
don't think this is ever going to be a
go-to of mine that's what I'll say so
overall I think it covers well so
obviously it does have pretty high
coverage that's what I would consider I
would say that it's medium to high
coverage you can build on top of it if
you want but right off the bat it's got
medium to full but you can really build
it up to full it never really looks
splotchy or cakey and I really like the
finish I feel like it looks really
satiny and nice now of course I've got
you know powder like highlighting powder
on top of it blush on and things like
that but I think on its own it really
does look nice now the price point these
are each around five dollars depending
on where you go and the concealer is
typically I think 399 maybe even cheaper
might even be $2.99 where you go so it's
not expensive at all especially
considering a lot of drugstore
foundations are going up there in price
like some of them are getting really
expensive to be honest um I would say
similar products to these let me see
average wise I would say the one wild is
similar to the covergirl three in one I
like the one wild one better because
it's more of a satin finish this one
really illuminates my dry patches but
this one does not which honestly blows
my mind for something that is as nice of
a finish as this is I can't believe it
doesn't illuminate my dry patches the
primer I feel like I don't have any
primers like this like I mentioned all
of my primers are that silicone velvety
feel to it and this one's different but
I do like it because what I've noticed
over the past week is that my foundation
doesn't move like it really does stay in
place and this on its own really stays
in place but I do think it looks better
with the primer um oh my gosh I really
love this foundation now the concealer
similar products hmm I want to say it
similar like the Maybelline fit me one
but I like to fit me better I think it's
got better coverage now I ended up
putting a bare minerals powder on top of
it like a powder concealer because as I
gone throughout my day I realized that
it was just kind of breaking up and look
not as it wasn't concealing anymore so
once I said it with a powder though it
looked a lot better so I think if you
are going to go with this definitely
have some sort of loose powder to set it
with so that way it doesn't move as much
but I like the packaging on these I am
really on all of them I like that these
are squeezy too because it's easy to
keep them clean and it's sanitary whoops
and then this same thing I don't mind
the packaging with the doe foot because
then you can put it exactly where you
need it to go I wish that this had I
wish that both of these had a wider
shade range for those with a lot darker
skin there's like not much and I wish
that they had a lighter version of the
concealer because I do feel like it's a
little darker for my skin so it wasn't
as brightening as well as concealing I
didn't notice any offensive smells with
anything's this kind of smells no see it
kind of smells like glue I really it
just slightly not enough that it's that
crazy and it's not like you smell it
throughout the day on your face but it
does have a little bit of a smell but
there's nothing offensive I think about
the other two um and it really isn't
sticky so once it did sink in like I'd
mentioned it's not sticky it stays put I
would say the best way to apply the
primer is with your hands obviously
because it's more of a lotion base I do
think this one it doesn't really matter
whether you use your hands or a brush I
prefer it with a brush just because I
felt like it looked a little just a
little bit better but honestly it was
basically the same some foundations it
really does matter how you apply like
especially if they're thicker but this
one you could apply it with your hands
it's going to look the same as if you
applied it with a brush or a Beauty
Blender for that matter and then the
concealer I would say blend it out with
a brush of some kind or a Beauty Blender
not your fingers because it just wiped
away with fingers and I would guess that
with the Beauty Blender this would
probably wipe away too because it's
really just very light and I don't love
it weird time on these all day all day
three hours like this is not great I
think you guys can guess how I feel
about this umm one quad sometimes has
coupons so if you're thinking about
where to buy wet and wild they will have
coupons every so often in ads for like a
dollar off it's kind of rare
but you can find them from time to time
and then of course like at CVS they'll
sometimes have buy one get one half off
steals I'm went wild or you know $1 off
of anything of wet and wild so you
really can't get sales although these
are so fairly priced that you don't have
to wait for a sale you know overall
would I recommend these products I would
recommend both of these and not the
concealer and it's not that the
concealer is terrible but it's just that
there's nothing that's special about it
I would recommend the Maybelline fit me
over it and it's probably two dollars
more and if you get it on sale it's
probably the same price and it's a
better concealer it there's a little bit
more of a color range it conceals better
and it stays put most of the day whereas
this one had left so if you're looking
for one I would recommend this one but I
really do like this primer I have a
feeling I'll be using this a lot a lot
because I really haven't fallen in love
with the primer and so far I really like
this one and the cover all I've been
using off and on for a long time because
I do love it and the only downfall is I
wish they had more of a shade range but
if you can find one in your shade or
really they're so inexpensive you could
get two and mix them to get the right
shade I really do love this stuff and
there's a ton of product in it and it's
lovely
so hopefully that review is helpful for
you guys I will post my review video
playlist down below if you're interested
in seeing a bunch more of my drugstore
reviews especially have a lot of things
that are new in the drugstore right now
that are really really cheap so if
you're interested definitely check those
out and subscribe if you enjoyed and
I'll catch you guys in my next one bye
okay so it's a Rimmel one and it's in
the shade crystal mauve whew I don't
think I've tried any of these this
packaging of Rimmel anyway um
it's so really like doesn't really have
a smell but it's a really creamy creamy
almost sheer ish formal it's a sheer but
it's you know what I mean it's kind of a
buttery formula I'm excited to try that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
