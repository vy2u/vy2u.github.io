we used to do videos like together a lot
of my doing it cuz like doing it on my
channel but yeah

channel because this is the end of
vlogmas like this video marks the end of
a special Bo yes of llamas however you
more the big finale yeah you're gonna
call me like we're getting sidetracked
anyway so definitely go subscribe to his
channel because that is where we'll be
doing this is not the big secret this
would be a very boring big secret but
that is where all of our vlogs go like
that's where they live and breathe so
except during long list mix video blog
this is like the only time of year
everyone's all just do a random like
decluttering vlog you know things but
pretty much all of our vlogs are always
on his channel so definitely subscribe I
know why do you guys did after watching
our vlog missus and and it was so
exciting because it's like just new
people all around and so the comments
are really fun the comments that one's
fun to read through and comment to lift
back towards for okay anyway so are you
ready for our big secret
we have been keeping a secret from you
guys for 18 weeks now yeah
so for nine out months it's a big secret
it's a very big probably the biggest
secret we've ever kept do you want to
say meet you they're probably like we
already now we figured it out we can
start like my students but up do you
want to say we're gonna try to stay
together almost a we say different names
ready one two three
I'm gonna say the same thing alright so
for real though we are having it be
and it is our first baby and it was like
the scariest thing it's never it's nuts
I don't know I can't I'm constantly
stressed and excited I know and I'm
always crying boys crying and bloated I
hate anyway so we've of course known
Ferb yeah while now but we were keeping
it a secret we had some scares early on
and oh my gosh
it should fit yeah everything right now
it's like finally but there are some
scary things going on early on and I
don't know if I'll talk about that
openly or not I don't know kind of
depends on what I feel comfortable with
and maybe it will help some of you guys
if you go through anything similar but
but the good news is everything is fine
healthy yes we don't know if it's a boy
or girl yet we're waiting with January
what January 8th 9th birthday we're
supposed to find out whether it's a boy
or girl yeah but we're just best
Christmas gifts we could ask for what do
you hope it is boy or girl no prank
it's be taking alcohol all of the above
I knew wrong answers so many people are
like don't you like have a feeling like
you know what it isn't like no that I
haven't had any dreams like no I don't I
have no idea what it is it's a baby it's
definitely a baby
good news oh no could be you evil I will
be all white it's BB anyway so so we're
going to Disney and Disney cruise for
sure so we're doing that like next week
and we're good as a little baby moon you
know people have a little baby moon or
less hurrah before the little dingdong
come but we're still playing like even
after the baby comes like we're still
playing I'm traveling all the time here
I think so
so along with us exactly exactly maybe a
little different at the beginning yeah
it's gonna be you have a well traveled
little kid so we I don't know that like
I know a lot of people when they have
kids like their YouTube channel they
suddenly do a lot of baby videos I don't
know that that's gonna be me I don't
feel like that fits in with my channel
and frankly I don't know anything
someone I feel like I just be like let
me just read this blog for you because I
know ideally
so the phenomimom says that Bob's
Burgers so I don't know that I would do
that like maybe if I wanted to talk
about what kind of thing the issue we
had early on maybe in the future I might
talk about that just because I think it
might be helpful to some people I know I
watched a lot of videos and read a lot
of blogs about it to help me feel more
at peace with anyway so as far as like
vlogging goes I mean it's just gonna be
a big part of your life since so
vlogging it'll be on my channel you'll
see a lot about you know yeah you know
we probably won't film in the doctor's
office but you know but you know come
over to my channel I'm gonna see like
you know kind of us going through
everything and all our travels with the
little dingdong and all that so anyway
but I hope you guys if you have been
watching blog this all along or even if
you haven't I hope you guys will watch
our Disney blogs and stuff and you're
planning on putting a vlog up of like us
packing and stuff for ya before we go
just like doo doo doo dong ding dong
okay we do stuff and then I'm gonna try
and give up and Disney like while we're
there I always say that I never do but
we'll see we'll see I'm trying dude this
time we're going alone and we have a
little bit of time no we don't we always
end up filling our time but it's so
awesome well why don't you spend more
time though like we want to obviously
spend tons of time in the parks but we
have annual passes so we have that kind
of freedom but we want to spend more
time like we're saying if you
contemporary for a while and then we're
staying at the boardwalk for a while and
just like actually spend time in the
resort like go to pools and like enjoy
is it's not frickin cheap yeah we're
going all out because this is like our
last trip together last I mean we've
done this like we've been together eight
years now and it's always been a big
part of our life is going to Disney used
to literally since the first year we
dated and so this is the last time we'll
ever go so you kind of went a little bit
emotional it is scary guys if you
haven't ever been pregnant had a kid
like this literally morally scary
like in an awesome way because it's so
exciting and like I don't know that
either one of us we knew we wanted kids
eventually but we didn't really know
like when or you know and I'm sure we're
not working now we're gonna have a kid
yes but just kind of flying by the seat
of our pants here yeah but it's exciting

knew that they were in order I told a
couple of my clients just like a select
