gonna share with you a video slow down
just I'm gonna share a video with you
and I it's just okay my brain is in ten
places slow down I told you that once
I'm gonna tell you it again these are
products that I'm removing for my
Sephora loves lists like literally as we
speak I have my laptop here I've got my
Sephora love's list pulled up if you
don't know what that is onca for his
website it's like a it's like your
favorites things like your kind of
saving for later like your wishlist well
i heavily use mine it's like too heavily
and there are products in here that I'm
like dying to try but there are also
products in here that I was kind of
wanting to try and now like either I've
seen some reviews on them or I've heard
something about them or whatever the
reason might be I'm removing them from
my loves list so it's kind of like an
anti haul but kind of not because these
are things that I was genuinely going to
find like I was you know so like
typically with anti hauls their products
that I'm like no no no like I have no
interest in at all
this is kind of like a anti haul light
because these were products that I
genuinely kind of wanted to buy but I
think I'm not going to of course I say
that now and then I'll change my mind
first thing that I had on my love's list
was the Too Faced white chocolate bar
eyeshadow palette I wanted it because
when I looked at it I was like ooh
there's light colors like it'll be nice
transition shades and and I like light
colors but I've heard some kind of
crummy things about it and the more I
look at it I'm like okay that's fifty
dollars I really do like the chocolate
bar palette I really like the sweet
peach palette but do I really need
another one and as I look at it I'm like
I really don't need any of these shades
like I've got all of these in different
palettes so this is one I'm going to
click the unloved on and it is gone
another palette I feel like a lot of
these are talents not all of them but
another palette I'm gonna remove is the
NARS narcissist wanted palette I'd put
it on cuz I saw a bunch of people got in
PR and I'm like oh my gosh and I saw
swatches I'm like oh my gosh it looks so
pretty it looks really pretty
umm so I added it to it it's $59 now
here's the deal I have the NARS
narcissus loaded palette and same setup
same kind of packaging but I never used
it and I didn't think the formula was
that great I have like
ours duos that the eyeshadow is amazing
like absolutely spectacular and I just
really wasn't impressed with that
narcissus palette so I'm like do I
really want another narcissus palette
these look like shades I might use a
little bit more but again I already have
it in like a million different other
palettes so I'm like I feel like I can
probably pass on this one so I'm loved
its feel so good what else so there's so
many things that I want let me know if
you want me to do like share what's on
my Sephora love's list another one I'm
gonna take off is this NARS
yah-tchi oh yeah Keogh brush it's number
27 um it's $55 and here's the thing let
me just show you
I literally brought bought this brush
from japonesque at Ulta and it was you
know under $20 and it looks like the
exact same as that $55 NARS brush um and
the other thing I realize even though
I'm sure the NARS one is made with
better and not ingredients but like
better quality products materials that's
what I mean but I kind of realize just
the shape of this I just don't really
love it's too tapered so I feel like
like if I'm using it for bronzer let's
say I feel like I need just the bronzer
on there because the second it gets out
there it's getting all over my face so
it's it's not as useful as I thought it
would be I do like it but I'm really
glad I I bought this cheaper one even
though I still think that was expensive
um so I am excited to take this NARS
manof another product I'm gonna take off
and mostly because I already have
another product to replace it is the
Dior Addict lip Maximizer plumping gloss
I'd heard it's amazing I don't really
care as much about the plumping my lips
sir first of all looking crazy right now
but my lips are big enough that I'm not
that's not something I'm concerned about
but I do like that tingly feeling and I
have liked pretty much every Dior lip
product I've ever tried while it's 33
dollars for a lip gloss and I found this
Sephora one I think Lola Lin here on
YouTube had recommended and I really
really like it it's the plump plump
effect lip gloss in the shade outrageous
I love it so much and I heard it's
so similar and I'm like do I really need
another one like the same shade same
effect no so I am unhardened at one
another one I'm on Harding
but I'm torn it's the Tom Ford quads I
bought the one in like orchid haze and
it was absolutely terrible and so I want
to unhurt the quad completely but now
I'm like still like well now I want to
try one of the like really glittery kind
of gold ones to see why are those the
ones that are worth the 85 freaking
dollars I think I'm gonna leave it on
there for now I'm gonna think about not
only going to take off is the UH
Nastasia prism palette that's why I keep
thinking about buying and I toss it back
and forth i've swatched it in store like
multiple times and I'm just gonna
unloved it because the reality is first
of all the colors in it are just not up
my alley like at all there are some that
I would use and sure it could force me
to branch out but again I have so many
palettes and I love the UH Nastasia
Modern Renaissance palette but those are
shades that are up my alley
you know I don't need another palette
that's just colors that I might use once
or twice to branch out but not enough to
you know for 40 something dollars so
that's another one that buy the other
thing I think I'm gonna take out I've
had the benefit gala for Nia blush in my
love's forever I'm not ever gonna buy it
it's one that I look at and like there's
like that kind of overspray on it but
I'm like yeah and I I do love the
benefit blushes I do I the only one I've
ever kept however is Dallas cuz that's
just the color I reached for all the
time but this is one in a monkey I might
reach for it from time to time and it
probably smells nice and I do like the
formula of their blushes but I don't
really care enough about it to even
spend $29 on hey didn't they used to be
like 26 sheesh
the other thing I'm gonna remove is the
Becca soft light blurring setting powder
it is $38 I just don't hear anything
about it and frankly I had so many like
loose powders and things like that and I
don't even use those enough that I'm
like Jessica do you really need another
one it'd be different if like you guys
were asking me to review it or you know
but there's really no like hype behind
it and none of you guys are curious
about it so I'm like then why I spent
$38 I'm not even sure
about it you know what I mean but it's
got the name Becca and so I'm like ooh
maybe but I just don't need it I don't
need another loose powder so I'm gonna
unloved that one as well those are all
of the ones I'm removing right now I
have so many so if you're curious I
think if I ever did a video about just
what is on my love's it would be way too
long I need to like declutter it again
because I like anytime I'm like maybe I
just heart it because I'm like I don't
want to have to search for it again I
don't know I guess I'm weird like that
but I have way too many products in
there but those are the ones that I
really feel strongly about that I'm not
gonna buy I don't need to buy if you
enjoyed this kind of video give it a
thumbs up it was certainly kind of fun
and just fancy free fun and fancy free
but other than that I hope you'll
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
