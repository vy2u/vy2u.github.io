the Ulta 21 days of beauty sale is here
depending on when you're watching this
but I figure even if this is like way
past the sale and it's already over with
this is 2018 by the way I wanted to at
least be able to give recommendations
enough so that you can see like okay
even if the sales over is this still
worth buying does that make sense so
it's not only for the sale but just
really some of my favorite products that
Ulta sells that just happen to be a part
of this sale but might still be worth
buying even if it's on sale okay not
sure if that made sense I just want to
remind you use Ebates if you have it
it's free no it's not sponsored or
anything like that but um it like the
day I'm filming this I literally just
noticed Sephora is eight percent cash
back I'm like oh so I pulled up Sephora
and I'm clicking around I'm like no
Jessica you're not allowed to buy
anything right now you are about to buy
things for three weeks on ulties website
you're not buying anything at Sephora oh
I stopped myself but ulties usually
around like three four or five percent
cashback I don't know how much it will
be throughout the sale and I'll still
increase it because of that but
basically you literally have an account
and you go to Ebates first go to ulties
website through Ebates
that's it and then it tracks whatever
you buy so if you spend a hundred bucks
you're gonna get five dollars back if
it's five percent cash back so it's it's
something that sounds kind of like that
can't be real it really is it's so easy
they pay you through PayPal like four
times a year I think you can also get a
paper check if you want but anyway I
love it I use it every single time and I
have a little browser button so it tells
me because otherwise I won't remember
okay that's all I'm gonna say about it
but I wouldn't feel right not mentioning
it because I know so many of you guys
use it too and you love it hope you
subscribe give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoy the style let's go and get
into it so I'm staring at my laptop here
and I'm just gonna go in order of days
so Sunday March 18th they have the lorac
Pro palette 3 for $22 now I recently
declutter this palette it was fine most
of the shadows were incredible I just
never reached for it but if you look at
these shadows and you think dude that's
totally something I would reach for it
might be worth it because are you
kidding me $22 like that's that's
getting close to drugstore prices and
that's gonna be the case for a lot of
this stuff and that's why it's so
exciting
but it's regularly $44 it really is
beautiful I remember there was one shade
in it that was like but every other
shade was absolutely stunning the
shimmers are beautiful
the mattes were beautiful so it's worth
buying if that is your cup of tea I'm
not gonna talk about every single
product cuz this video would be a
thousand years long I'm just gonna talk
about the ones that you feel really
strongly about that I love them or that
I really don't like them and I'm also
gonna share products that I myself I'm
going to purchase so by the way I had
mentioned on snapchat like oh man it
stinks because you know all of these are
separate days that you'd have to buy
these and if you're buying them online
you're going to pay for shipping every
time but then so many of you guys are
like dude no if you're platinum it's
free shipping for these items I'm like
so I'm like that is so exciting and I
think I'm platinum I have to be right
ulties rewards system I've heard is
amazing but I really haven't delved into
it like I'm so used to Sephora's which
is not really that great so I really
need to like learn more about altas
because I know I'm earning rewards and
I'll use them from time to time but
anyway so March 19th
they have the origins ginseng tinted
moisturizer this is not a high coverage
moisturizer it really is like a
moisturizer with a tiny bit of tint so
for me I was all excited cuz I'd heard
other youtubers years ago talk about it
so when I tried it I thought this is
gonna be amazing
it really wasn't I it provided
essentially no coverage so I couldn't
for me I didn't want to wear just that I
wanted more coverage than that but if
you're really low-key and you don't
really care about coverage but you want
some SPF you maybe want a little bit of
a tint you might really like it next day
Tuesday March 20th they have this pure
press mineral foundation for 50% off I
didn't like this stuff it was really
patchy on my skin but I know there are
other youtubers that love it now I think
the youtubers that love it tend to
really like super matte skin so if
that's you then you might really like
this if you're more like me and you like
a little bit more glow I don't really
like it cuz I really didn't okay one of
the most exciting ones is my one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes of the year
that I discovered it's from the brand
persona it's 50% off so it's now gonna
be 16 dollars instead of 32 and it's
their identity I shadow palette I love
this palette so much let me grab mine it
is it's just
like this shimmers in it are gorgeous
the mats are gorgeous they all blend so
beautifully I can do so many different
kinds of looks with it oh my gosh are
you kidding me
so swatches so in my opinion probably
the most exciting thing that I saw on
sale that if you don't own this you will
love it I love it so so so much way more
than I ever thought I would now
something that I'm gonna personally buy
on this day is the Smashbox photo finish
primer water it's 16 dollars instead of
32 I think I used to have it and I
declared it and I hadn't even used it
and I was like I don't really want a
primer water but now I've heard so many
people talk so highly of it I'm like
dang it so I think I figure while it's
only 16 dollars I think I'm going to try
that and now you don't have to use it
just as primer you can use it to set
your makeup and refresh your makeup to
Thursday March 22nd another favorite of
mine the buxom full-on lip creams
they're 50% off sir only ten bucks the
most famous shade they have is White
Russian it's very kind of a Kim
Kardashian kind of a shade these have a
tingle that kind of plumps your lips
very minty I don't mind the feel but I
know some people do there's definitely a
strong scent to them it's ice it's kind
of minty but it's almost like coffee
cake that's really more of a smell that
I get from it
but I really like it I own quite a few
of them I love all of them so this is a
one in Sandi and it's one of my
favorites it's a very everyday color you
know it's just a gloss it doesn't have a
ton of pigment to it
I know some of their deeper ones do
though so something to keep in mind but
I really really like these and then they
have the Clarisonic I love my Clarisonic
so much now I've been using my
Clarisonic more for even just blending
in my foundation with the foundation
brush pad but I also used it for
cleansing my skin I've been using that
and something else I'll talk about in a
future video but this is a really good
deal it's still expensive the sale price
is 119 the 169 so if you've been
thinking about getting it honestly
that's a pretty stellar deal for that I
don't know how much better of a deal
you're gonna get on that so I mean it
cleans your face really really well it
really does then once you own that if
you wanted to buy the foundation brush
head I'll use the foundation brush had
to blend in like
tor bronzer like cream ones I love it
the next day they have some eye shadow
singles from urban decay for 50% off I I
don't know that I really own I have
owned some in the past through our
Benecke side shadows are amazing so if
there's like one single shadow or maybe
even a handful of them that you just
love then it's probably worth it like
one of my favorite urban decay shadows
is half-baked it's so really pretty gold
and I have it like in my naked palettes
but like if I ever wanted it to travel
with it'd be nice to have a separate one
right so that's something to keep in
mind if there's like a single shadow
that you know you would travel with a
lot or you'd like it to be more portable
that'd be a good way to do that and then
I'm interested in the velour lashes I've
never tried them and so they're 50% off
so it's a price range to see anywhere
from 7 to 14 dollars instead of 14 to 29
another favorite is on sale the next day
so now we're on Saturday March 24th it
is the Stila stay all day waterproof
liquid liner one of my favorites it's
only 11 dollars instead of 22 now I also
love my NYX epic ink liner and that's
kind of replaced it and I think it's
better but I still think the seal ones
are amazing so if you've been dying to
try or maybe you already love them $11
is a really good deal might be worth
buying like more than one of them oh my
gosh I'm gonna tell you when to avoid
this is on Sunday March 2nd it's the it
cosmetics confidence in a compact like
creme foundation stuff
I tried applying that stuff every way I
can think of brush sponge fingers the
little I think it came with a sponge too
it did not make any sense I don't know
how anyone has made this thing work so I
would it says it's a super moisturizer
but it's got color to it it looks
horrible I literally could not figure
out how to spread it across my face in
the right way where it looked good so I
would personally avoid they have and
I've not tried this particular brush
maybe I'll buy it it brushes for all
types and a cosmetics brush their
brushes are amazing some of my favorite
brushes are their face brushes and it's
only 11 dollars it's a foundation one so
I'm personally thinking by getting that
one and then a platinum perk for that
day so if your platinum you can get it
or diamond I'm sure they have 50% off
the Porefessional from benefit it's 15
bucks I like that I think you'll like it
more if you
more oily skin I've got more dry skin so
I don't it's a good primer but I don't
use all the time because I just don't
really have the need for it another one
I'm buying I need to make my own list I
really do with like reminders on my
phone so I don't forget to buy them but
they're doing 50% off the becca primers
so i freaking love the backlight priming
filter and it will only be $19 and 7:38
oh my gosh it's such a let me cry
because I've got it right here I've used
probably about half of it already which
is crazy because I have a lot of primers
but it's a very not shimmery glowy kind
of a primer I put it all over my face
and then I put foundation on top and it
just I don't think this increases the
wear time necessarily of my foundation
but it makes it look so nice so even
when it's a really high coverage drying
foundation it makes my skin still look
like it's kind of glowing from within
which is the look I personally like but
it doesn't look oily if you're putting
on like a foundation on top but the one
I'm gonna buy that I don't own yet is
the first light priming filter I've
almost bought this like 10 times and I'm
so glad I have it bought the full size
because because I have like a little
trial size because now it's gonna be 19
bucks so that is definitely what I'm
getting and I think I'm also that same
day gonna buy the Lancome Hypnose drama
mascara this is a cult classic I haven't
tried it in years it was one of the very
first expensive purchases I ever made I
remember where I was living at the time
I remember I just gotten into watching
YouTube videos and I bought this and it
was such a big deal cuz I have like no
money and it it's just like nostalgic
and I don't remember how much I loved it
so I want to buy that again I'd be 1375
instead of 2750 so on Tuesday March 20th
they have the lorac Pro contour palette
I have not owned this but I've heard
amazing things I just don't need any
more contour palettes so this is what
I'm gonna pass on only because I know I
don't need it but it's 20 bucks instead
of 45 if you are in need of a contour
palette I've heard it is amazing it's
got you know it's all matte it's got a
great tone one a much deeper and then
it's got more of a bronzey warmer bronze
bronzer and then it's got some lighter
colors more of a banana powder a more
ivory
more beige powder so I need to be worth
it if you're in need of it one thing I'm
just interested in is the cap re coconut
melt
I love the cap re coconut lip like gloss
kind of stuff and this is it says it's
100% organic coconut oil using 8 ways to
treat your hair body and skin I'm just
intrigued it's 14 bucks instead of 28 so
I might also buy that the next day is
Wednesday March 28th they have these I'm
not really excited about anything this
day the 50% off bare minerals 5 and 1
cream eyeshadows I've had those they
were okay they weren't bad but it was
nothing that I felt that strongly about
and I've sensed too cluttered them so I
felt they were good but it didn't I just
didn't really care about him Thursday
March 29 they have the roller lash if
you like that the roller lash mascara is
very very good at defining your lashes
and separating them and curling them but
it for me it didn't add enough volume so
I didn't love it but I still thought it
was a great mascara and you have to know
yourself like what do you look for in a
mascara because it was very defining and
very curling and then there's the little
full exposure travel palette I've had my
eye on for a while because it's so cute
and little it's from Smashbox and that
will be 1250 instead of 25 bucks
it just it's got formats for shimmers
and I I don't need it but kind of part
of me is like maybe I buy it anyway
maybe I buy it anyway Friday March 30th
oh the Too Faced melted matte lipsticks
if you're in too long we're drying lip
creams I mean these they really I mean
they're beautiful colors but they
definitely dry down like all liquid
lipsticks do and then eventually they
look dry so you know take that with a
grain of salt I'm not a big fan of that
formula anymore I'm just moving beyond
it but 1050 and SEP 21
next day they have the Anasazi of brow
Wiz pencil for 1050 I know this is the
time of year the people that love the
brow Wiz will buy like five of them for
the year or six of them for the year and
spend like 60 bucks instead of what's 21
times 6 like uh-huh 120 that would be
doubled up cuz it's about anyway so I
mean you save a ton of money
if you've never even tried it it really
is a nice pencil it's got a very very
fine tip has a nice bully on the end I
end up using thicker brow pencils just
because it's quicker in the morning but
that one it's really small but it does
blend into it beautifully and every time
I pull mine out and use it I'm like oh
yeah like it really is nice but moving
into April they have the dose of colors
marvelous moths eyeshadow palette hold
on friends now I've tried this and in
recent videos I've been wearing this so
that my kind of pinky purpley look on my
eyes is this palette that you've seen in
some recent videos it's nice I think
I've decided that these darker colors in
this palette just don't blend as well
and as I read through your guys's
comments about my frustration with
getting ready with this lighting guy
said no seriously I feel like the darker
colors that palette just don't blend as
well as like the lighter ones and so a
lot of you guys have recommended the
other dose of colors palettes like the
Browns one is one that I've got my eyes
on but this is only 16 bucks on that day
so if these colors totally speak to you
go for it but it's just something that I
think you know I might get some more use
out of these lighter colors but that's
about it
something I'm thinking about though is
the 50% off bare minerals foundation
primers they have a few different ones
so they'll be anywhere from right 12 to
13 dollars instead of 25 to 27 so that's
something I'm thinking about because I
see they have one that's called good
hydrations like good good good bad so
I'm thinking about getting that one just
because I feel like I haven't tried
enough bare minerals primers but I'm
gonna think about it next day they have
the butter LONDON glaze and lip glaze
but they also have their eyeglasses let
me show you I love their eye glosses
it'll be like around two at 9:52 twelve
dollars depending these are gorgeous so
I have the shade moonshine which is I
mean these are literally look like
pudding but then you just kind of spread
it across your eye moonshine is a really
pretty it's got glitter in it for sure
but the glitter kind of stays put
because it's in this formula kind of a
grayish color and then this other one I
really like is icing and this is more of
a kind of rose gold bronze color they
are free
gorgeous so for these to be around $10
totally worth it I don't think you need
every single one but if you found one
shade that you really really like I'd
say go for it I think out of these two I
like icing better but they stay on
really well because they dry down and
then they're really hard to get off like
I already can barely get them off I've
tried the cosmetics confidence in your
glow heavenly skin one sweet wonder it's
got this brush it also has the actual
like product the blush kind of product
the brush I did like it was very
seamless now I didn't just sweep it on
in one sweep I actually used it sideways
and just kind of blend it that way and
it did look a little more diffused which
I did like so the brush was cool it just
I didn't feel like it was worth the
price now of course with it being half
off I don't know which one it says now
sixteen to twenty four dollars it
doesn't say which one like which product
is which but then the other product the
actual like highlight blush bronze it
was alright I just mixed it all together
and it was just fine like it wasn't bad
so if you're really really dying to try
it but it wasn't anything that I felt
like so strongly about again I've
already did cluttered them oh my gosh
one of my least favorite foundations
from buxom it's 50% off so it only be 17
bucks a set of 34 it's their show some
skin it's some other people's holy
grails from what I heard it's a
weightless foundation I had heard it was
really good for dry skin so I tried it
on and I couldn't get it to like stay it
was the weirdest thing like I couldn't
get it to stay long enough to even set
it it was like it would just rub all
over I tried it with my fingers with a
brush with a sponge and it just like
kind of rubbed around and it never
stayed I tried many different primers I
tried it without primer I don't know I
just had the weirdest experience with it
so if you love it let us know below
because if someone I don't want to deter
someone that may be really really likes
it or thinks they will but it was just
odd I got rid of that one too feel like
I'm getting negative I need to like tone
it down but I'm trying to be honest with
you guys one thing I'm gonna buy is the
dermablend loose setting powder it'll be
1315 set of 27 dollars I've heard really
good things about this dermablend powder
and I really have not heard anything
else about dermablend at all but the
powder is the one thing I hear about
that's why I'm wanting to try and see
what the hype is there and then they
also have 50% off the cargo swimmable x'
so like I want to get another cargo
blush because I know they're blushes
freaking don't budge I used to have one
a long time ago and I think I had a
bronzer too and they really stay put
like all day long it's crazy I would
recommend the eyeshadow primer potion
from Urban Decay it's been a cult
classic for a long time
it's 11 or 12 dollars depending I'm sure
on what shade you get I just use the
original I really like it I've heard
good things about the anti-aging one too
so that's one that I'm personally
thinking about I'm giving a try I don't
know if that's one of the ones oh
there's the one and eat in two so it's
like a little bit of a color to it so
that's a pretty darn good deal for the
full-size of that one thing I am pretty
sure I'm gonna buy is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear flawless wear concealer
it'll be 14 dollars instead of 28 and I
really have been enjoying their their
new nude foundation and so I'm like I
want to try the concealer I've heard
good things about it so that's something
on my radar that I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna buy to then another thing I'm for
sure gonna buy is the Mac prep and prime
fix plus this is 13 bucks instead of 26
for the full size right now I just have
a small size that I've it's just about
used up and I love it it just takes your
powder on your face and when you spray
it everywhere it just melts it in so it
stays all day but it doesn't look super
cakey or dry I mean it is like a miracle
worker I fly through that stuff those
are all of the deals that kind of stood
out to me they're obviously more I will
link just their regular 21 days little
like add they have a bunch of buy three
get one free of like these minis that
you can do so have this Hot Buys section
and I will link the link just to this
section of their kind of online
catalogue and these are products that
are basically on sale everyday all those
other products were on sale on just one
day so you have to buy it that day if
you want it in store online these are on
sale the whole sale so one thing I'm
pretty sure I'm going to get is the
Tarte Ready Set radiant skin mist it's
gonna be 15 bucks stead of 25 for the
full size and it's just kind of a more
radiant kind of a skin mists and I'm
really into that right now and I have a
little trial and I did like it so I want
to get that they also have the
coverfx anti-aging primer I freaking
love my cover effects not the blurring
primer the calming primer it's one of my
favorite primers of all time and they're
regularly 38 bucks so I think $22 is a
good deal for an anti-aging I'm like I
mean I'm gonna be 30 next year like
let's get this train rolling so that's
something I'm thinking about picking up
the butter LONDON glaze in blush chalets
are gonna be $15 I would say away I've
used them in a video but my idiot self
used them on top of powder so of course
it looked crazy but then I use them the
next day the right way not on top of
powder and it still looked terrible so
it just I couldn't get it even it just
it just did not look good it was a cool
look to the product cool idea of in
actuality it just didn't work they have
these smashbox always sharp eye liners
that I have heard really good things
about and they're 12 bucks here in the
sale something about just getting a
black or maybe a brown in that and they
also have the Shu Saito eyelash curler
for 15 bucks that is a cult favorite and
I've not tried it yet so that's another
one I've got my eye on oh Jessica you're
gonna end up buying way too much so
those are all of my recommendations
products I've tried products I am
planning to buy myself and then products
that I really think you might want to
think about staying away from if you're
you know I tried to explain it as best
as I could but if you're interested in
any of these I will link all of them
below if I can as well as the online ads
like I said so you can check it out for
yourself because there's a lot more than
what I mentioned a lot more so other
than that I hope you enjoyed and I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
