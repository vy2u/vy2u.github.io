share with you old-school YouTube what's
in my purse I always laugh when I watch
these videos because typically people
are like this is my $2,000 Louis Vuitton
bag and I'm like now in all fairness I
do from time to time splurge on designer
items so I can't really be on my high
horse because I do from time to time
splurge on designer items I get it I do
but I'm like and maybe it's just more
jealousy I'm like oh my gosh $2,000
like what anyway regardless this is from
Target so this is my bag right now now I
am pregnant and depending on when you're
watching this and what happens in my
life I don't know I could have already
had the baby also probably I didn't I
don't know regardless this is the bag
I'm currently using but it's gonna be
kind of switched out and stuff as I
eventually have a diaper bag and I might
just be using that with some of my stuff
in it you know first is having a person
in a diaper bag but for now that's what
I'm using I got it at Target very
recently so if I can find it I will link
it below I actually show I was shopping
for it in my like Target shopping vlog
that I will link below as well which is
really fun so this is a mess I've not
cleaned it out it is genuinely I laughed
because as I peeked in and I was like
some of the stuff you guys really like
Jessica what is wrong with you but
whatever
so in this front pocket I always keep my
phone and so I have I got this case from
Amazon again it's like 10 bucks but I
wanted one that I have the iPhone 10
which I like because really for photos
alone like for social media and stuff
and like for my thumbnails I take almost
all of my thumbnail pictures of products
on my phone I love it and we vlog on her
phone anyway so it was a good purchase
for us but this case is more kind of
rubberized but still structured and you
can push the buttons really easily
because that was a problem I had I had
one that was really cute but you never
like work to push the buttons and I'm
like I cannot do this and I wanted one
where I could still fit it like on an
eye home charger without any problem and
this one was a little more open so I
will link this case they have different
colors but I really liked this kind of
periwinkle case so that's why keeping
that front pocket and then we
open it opens to a much larger
compartment it's messy and then there's
like a zipper pocket on one side and
like two little just pockets on the
other so we're just gonna we're just
gonna do this first thing I have a
notebook I bought from Erin Condren with
my name on it I'm about halfway through
I've got notes from doctors appointments
I've got my to-do list my to film lists
just all kinds of stuff there's a
calendar in the front of it I don't
actually use it and actually I think
it's even old I think it's from 2017 so
I'm just using the notebook portion of
it but I do like it I like that this can
lay flat because like it doesn't have
that I don't know I really I'm enjoying
this so I can see myself buying another
one of these once I've used this up
completely so that is usually in there
although it does transfer from here to
my desk kind of back and forth a lot
then I've got my glasses which actually
this is just my case my glasses are over
there I have a couple these are speaking
of designer these are Chanel ones so
it's got a really cool case it's kind of
a splurge but I was like you know I want
to have glasses that I feel excited to
wear so when I have to wear them I don't
feel like oh it's a glasses day so I was
really excited to oh and let me just
grab as you can see oh I am eye contacts
in too so it's like way too much so
these are them I really like them I have
some other ones too over there but these
are the ones I like wear all the time so
I try to keep them in my purse but
obviously sometimes it's just the case
no glasses and I keep a cleansing cloth
in there because I need it all the time
I have my stuff about my birth plan and
I have some ultrasound pictures um we've
had a lot of ultrasounds with this
pregnancy cuz you've had a lot of scares
and just weird stuff happen so we're
having them like all of the time which
is honestly amazing because we get to
see our baby all the time and I'm pretty
sure we've already hit her deductible
this year which is I guess great I don't
I got a receipt from TJ Maxx this is
terrible
oh I've got my wallet which this is a
Marc Jacobs one so this one I did
splurge on but I got it on HauteLook so
I mean it's so expensive on there but
it's like usually 40 to 50 percent off I
can link it below
got some receipts in here and you know
I'm not gonna show you everything in my
wall you don't really need to see but no
cash I heard they ever have cash so
that's that I do I used to use a smaller
wallet I had like a small black one but
honestly I was like you know what I have
so many cards and this black ones so
thick now because I've got so many cards
kind of just makes sense to have this I
like the single zip simple I like this
color it matches any purse not that it
really matters but it does so I I love
the simplicity of that wallet hey like a
thousand sets of keys like this is my
set of keys where I've got like our
security thing keys to the house and
like little like cards and stuff but I
always keep it in here but I have my car
keys separate just because this is so
heavy to have hanging from your like
when you're driving and then I have my
school keys oh oh I will show you though
this I got in Disney it's like a really
cute I think it's really cute really
sturdy strong little holder and it's got
a little Mickey thing that connects it
to the keys which I thought was so so
cute I've got this little thing I
actually had a pen floating around that
I just used to hold pens and then I also
sometimes I'll have a charger in there
so like this is actually just an adapter
like for the headphone jack cuz I
sometimes need at my car when my USB
things not working but I always end up
needing a pen so I finally worked Alice
like just could forget it just grab a
little thing that's actually a brush and
elf brush holder and I'm just holding
some pens in there so and it's actually
nice cuz now I at least know like I
always have my notebook but then I don't
have a pen now I know I've got quite a
few in there um let's see I've got a
little paint opener cuz we were at Home
Depot and I put it in my purse I have I
was at my sister's today and we we okay
when I hang out with my sister we have
this thing called a coffee klatch where
we always have coffee and we talk and
it's just great well since I'm pregnant
I can't have quite as much caffeine and
so I brought over some half calf's for
myself so instead of having one cup I
could have two and then she had some
extra she gets me anyway so that's why
they were in my purse I need to put them
in our near our coffee pots um so then I
have this makeup bag now this is not the
only makeup I have because I have some
I'm going to show you but I'm sure this
is what you're curious to see this is
from this brand Lily England I've
actually never even heard of this brand
but they sent me some brushes and this
bag like a year two ago and I love again
the simplicity of this cute white bag
it's like the rose gold zipper that's it
I think it's so cute
I've got medicine in here this I buy on
Amazon as well I need to buy new one
because honestly I've had it for a while
and it's kind of dirty but what you can
do is you can put like little bits of
Medicine or vitamins whatever and it
just pops open like that you can get
stuff out so that's really nice because
that I always have like some sort of
headache medicine if I need it you know
things like that and like it's great
because if Tyler's like hey do you have
any this medicine I'm like I yes I do I
often bring this when I'm traveling too
because I never need any more than
what's in here but it's nice to have and
it takes up virtually no room so I will
if I can find this on Amazon so this was
years ago I will link it and actually I
might buy myself a new one I always have
Vaseline this I use on my lips from time
to time but I always have it because I
am prone to nosebleeds especially in the
winter and I remember a nurse telling me
long ago to put some Vaseline in your
nose and it just kind of it kind of
lubricates and moisturizes the nasal
passages and just you know I don't know
it always works so when I get a bloody
nose I'll put a little bit of this in
there and then wash my hands and
literally it like stops it up and it's
good I mean if I've it's it's amazing
contact lens case I've got a few lip
balms I've got this drunk elephant lippy
balm which is actually nicer than I
thought it would be and then this
Kiehl's lip balm number one I really do
like this it's got squalane vitamin E I
have one of these in my night scene as
well but this I like to keep in my purse
because Tyler often asked for lip balm
and this is perfect for him because it's
not like super glossy but it's nice and
moisturizing too so I'm a big fan of
that I do have a touch-up powder and I
always make sure to put one in here that
has a mirror this is the cosmetics
celebration foundation powder and so it
doesn't have the illuminating quality to
it but I like that it's got a mirror I
mean it has a little puff underneath it
to apply I clearly
not applied it on the go yet I just have
it in there that's the thing that's so
funny
I'll always bring makeup with me and I
never use it I never do I just always
have it just in case and anyway I do
have a hand cream I'm almost out of this
is from Bath and Body Works it's there
marshmallow pumpkin lots of hand cream
they're hand creams actually are nice
the ones like this and I feel like
they've improved their formula where it
actually genuinely feels very
moisturizing I have some rewetting drops
for contact lenses because I get really
dry eyes these are from blink and clean
they're really nice I have my coat elite
beauty elixir it's just a facial spray
so if I feel like maybe I just applied
that powder or I just don't like that my
face looks dull or maybe it looks really
dry I'll spray this all over and it
feels it's refreshing and it kind of
makes my makeup look a little bit better
I always take bobby pins and tie a bunch
of hair ties around them so they're all
together they're not just loose but I
know where to go if I need them so those
are in there that's kind of like a trick
I travel I never need any more than this
so it's perfect so I have like lots of
the this little concoction like all over
the place and then I do have some lip
products and okay these are the two I
genuinely put in here and now I have
some more in there that I've just been
using so this hourglass confession
lipstick in I've kissed is a really
pretty like everyday rosy color for me
oh my gosh I love this stuff and then
this is the urban decay it's a new one
I'm trying out it's their ultra cushion
lip gloss and it's in the shade Naked so
it kind of has like a metallic look to
it on the outside but really when you
put it on it doesn't look like that but
it's minty I really like it again just a
simple everyday color it's hard to get
the thing in there I end up getting it
the lip gloss everywhere so then I just
have in a side pocket here and actually
I just need to put these back in my
collection cuz I don't need all of these
I've got a mac lipglass in cultured
again standard everyday pink but I
really I just really like it it's got a
nice shimmer in it it's really pretty
it's the only mac lipglass I think I've
kept and then this was my wedding lip
color and I was wearing it the other day
this is from Edward best I don't even
know if this brain is still around
it's in the shade Rose demure it's not a
great long wearing formula but it was
the color so I had to reapply it all the
time on my wedding day but I love this
color so much so that's in there and
then this lip liner
it's a L'Oreal color riche matte in
mattes it this is an amazing lip liner
certainly deep but these this formula is
ridiculous it's so creamy and yet long
wearing I also have the lipstick the
Clinique pop matte lip color and
blushing pop this is more of a matte lip
color
I've actually paired it with that lip
liner and even though they are a little
different it looks actually really
pretty so this it's a more drying
formula but it's still a really pretty
matte I have a half-eaten Clif Bar it's
the peanut butter delicious but I see
the thing is I don't like to eat a whole
Clif Bar just because I feel like it's a
lot if I'm not like working out right
then in there it's just got a lot in it
that I don't know that I need the entire
thing but then I end up with like
half-eaten ones everywhere so I need to
like actually finish them I also have a
prayer card and then I have sunglasses
this changes all the time like what's in
here this is just a little bag and then
the sunglasses in here these are
actually pretty cool sunglasses I think
the brand is illest Eva yeah so I do
like these they get finger printing
really quickly and then oh I have a bye
bye baby of packing slip from something
that was sent to me for our future babe
and I think that's it that's everything
so messy now that I've cleaned it out
I've got I put all my makeup back in
here but those lip products I'm gonna
take out and put back in my thing
the Clif Bar can go so we're kind of
decluttering my purse as we go aren't we
these sunglasses are gonna go back in
the pens are gonna go back in I'd like
to have everything at least like in bags
you know the keys need to need to live
in here my glasses case can go back in
my wallet can go back in the ultrasound
does not need to be in there I actually
need my notebook after this video so I'm
just gonna leave it out my
thought about but that's pretty much it
so I was able to take out the coffee
pots the paint stirrer the extra lift
products the receipt the prayer card I'm
gonna put my nightstand
the Clif Bar that's half gone can be out
of there so all in all I feel like it's
a little bit lighter now just a little
bit and cleaner but I really I like this
back I like how simple it is I love the
blush pink I love that the shoulder drop
is long enough that it's not like so
short you feel weird it's comfortable so
and I like that the whole thing zips
shut because when it's raining nice to
know that like everything is protected
cuz I feel like a lot of the past purses
I've had have been ones that you can't
really shut properly and so it's like
let me run out in the rain and get
everything in my purse wet while I'm at
it so I hope you enjoyed this old school
like original YouTube kind of a video

that I hope you'll subscribe and tap
that notification bell so you're
