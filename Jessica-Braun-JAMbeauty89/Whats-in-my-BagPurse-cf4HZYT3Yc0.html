to my channel I figured for my next
video I would do a what's in my bag
video and this is the bag I've been
carrying around
it's a Tommy Hilfiger bowler bag I think
they called it and um it's just really
nice it seems really durable and
well-made and I think it's perfect for
summer and spring and it was originally
$98 and I got it for $22 of Marshalls so
ladies be sure to check Marshalls and TJ
Maxx because of course they always have
really nice designer bags for like way
cheaper than they would be if you went
to the actual store so so inside I have
it I'm a pretty organized person so my
purse is usually pretty organized and I
usually store things vertically so that
I can kind of see it and be able to grab
it grab it without you know messing
everything up so the biggest thing in
there is my iPad and my iPad case and if
you do follow me on Instagram you saw
when I hauled this bag that I showed you
but also when I hauled this from Kohl's
it's a Dana Buchman like leopard print
case and it was originally $60 and I got
it for one dollar because I had a five
dollar off coupon and then it was only
six dollars it was like on clearance and
they had a ton of different kinds so and
that was only like a couple weeks ago so
they might still have them you don't
want to check them out but yeah it's
just really really nice it's got a
really nice like faux snakeskin type
feel to it and all these pockets and
stuff which I like and then a really
nice snap closure so really nice and
slim I can fit it easily in my bag I
also carry around whatever book I'm
reading I'm reading Life of Pi right now
and I want to share with you guys my
book my bookmark I really really like it
I think I got it at like um half-price
books but it just says teach us to light
in simple things and that's by rudyard
kipling and I just like that and I like
when I'm reading you know it is a more
simple thing to just read and it's
something that I really really enjoy and
I like being reminded of that every time
I pick up my book and it's you know
that's just one of my favorite bookmarks
okay so my wallet it's just a no-name
wall at me and one of my best friend's
Emily have the same wallet from von Maur
is a really good deal and you know it's
just the typical cards I want to show
you all them cash and things like that
not a ton of pockets but just enough and
it does have a zipper pocket for like a
change and it's by the brand Lulu
and then something to carry around my
feminine products but it's really nice
because it was like two or three dollars
at Walmart as a cute little heart zipper
and it's discreet so things aren't just
like thrown around on your purse like
that you got them all in one location I
have a case for my sunglasses this was
only like five or six dollars at
Marshall's and then some Steve Madden
sunglasses that are nice and big which I
love and then thirty I need to Webb mom
and then they have a cute like little
rhinestone detail or yeah tiny
rhinestones um love those and then I
also have a bag I really really like
getting good deals if you can't tell
like everything I've talked about was on
some sort of sale and so in this fact I
carry around my receipts you know to
make returns and stuff and then also
coupons so I keep my receipts all
together with one of these clips and I
do the same with my OOP coupons
why do we put them in there upside down
yes okay and then my coupons usually
make up and like um hair coupons but um
yeah so I keep all those organized data
in there along with like shopping lists
if I have any things like that and then
I've got a granola bar
um because the girls got eat so I also
in the like little zipper pocket I have
my keys and one thing worth noting is
this little guy that holds my headphones
is just so convenient to have on your
keys because a it keeps them so they're
not like getting all tangled and crazy
but so I don't forget them when I go to
the gym because I have to drive there so
I know I would have my keys and then I
have to walk into the gym with my gym
thing so it's nice to have my headphones
with me so I never forget them because I
always did before I had that so I also
keep in like these side little pockets
here tissues these are just cute they
have like a little makeup brush on them
from Target and then I have gum and then
Oh a pad of paper I never used to carry
one around with me
but then I saw these cute ones at the
dollar store these were like two in a
pack and they like magnetized clothes
for a dollar and now with I tear on
paper I'm constantly writing things down
and I always make lists and things like
that but I would do them on the back
receipts but now like this it's awesome
so if you don't carry around a pad of
paper with you you should because it's
it's pretty nice to have around it
literally feels like a luxury which is
so sad but whatever um I had this pen my
daddy gave me it's a vir bradley pen and
it took me forever to find the refills
for this pen but I finally did and I
went to like seven stores it was
ridiculous I can't say that I know a lot
about pens and penny fills and then the
chapstick I've been using just
back-to-basics chapstick classic has a
really low SPF which means so it's not
going to dry me out but it gives a
little protection from the Sun SPF of
four and you know they're so cheap and I
don't know it's just it's been really
good for my lips lately I also have my
contacts case and it's just you know got
the thing it's got a little mirror that
I never use and then I've got my makeup
bag which I will show you inside of my
makeup bag in maybe another video all
right actually if you follow me on
instagram I have a picture I'm talking
about Instagram way too much I'm so
sorry I'm a total Instagram nerd though
I really really do love it um but I've
posted most of the things that are in
here a little bit has changed but not a
ton but if you're really really curious
you can look on my Instagram but I'll
probably also do a separate video of
what I carry around in here but this is
just a Marc Jacobs rose gold little
makeup bag it was like it was part of
the Marc Jacobs for target line that
they had out at Christmas
they did a lot of like the Nordstrom
like designers or whatever um but this
is originally like $70 ish and after
Christmas it was on clearance for like I
think I got off like $15 so still a
little pricey for a makeup bag but it
seems to be pretty well made and I
really really like it you can fit a lot
and it stays pretty darn thin to just
slide into your bag so yes we did it
that is everything that's in my purse I
think and like I said I will do a video
on what's inside there soon and please
comment down below with ideas for videos
I think I might do an I love spring tag
soon if you haven't seen any of those
videos you can type that into YouTube
and find them because those are some fun
videos and it is springtime and I guess
that is all and I will see you soon and
if
enjoyed this video please subscribe and
I will see you ladies soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
