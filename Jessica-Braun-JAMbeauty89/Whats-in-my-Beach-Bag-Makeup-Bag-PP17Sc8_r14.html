for the very long kind of a gap in
videos but I have been on vacation and
it was oh so lovely and I actually went
to a lake house with my entire family
and I don't know if I think I've
mentioned on the video I have a huge
family I've got three sisters and two
brothers
most of them have kids so I'm like I
have like a jillion aunts
no I'm an aunt what I have like a
million nieces and nephews and it's just
so fun so we all went to this lake house
and it was absolutely lovely
and if you can't tell I got some color
which is awesome for a while but my skin
so dry so this video is going to be
about just some beach or you know Lake
any type of thing where you're gonna be
getting in the water you're gonna be in
the Sun any type of Beach vacation like
that this is going to be all the
essentials you ever need when it comes
to kind of makeup and just uh just
you'll know what I mean as we get into
it so one thing I want to say that if
you can make it happen on your Beach
vacation lake house vacation whatever it
is is to try to unplug as much as you
can when I first got to the lake house
my phone slipped off the island in the
kitchen and fell on to the ground and
broke and so I was without a phone that
entire week I had my iPad but the Wi-Fi
and the lake house was kind of spotty so
I kind of took that as an opportunity
and maybe a way of God telling me hey
you need to unplug for a while so I did
and if you notice I posted maybe a
picture maybe two on Instagram I really
didn't post much because it was just so
nice to just you know get away from it
all for a while so if you can made it to
unplug as much as you can do that first
then after that pack these things and
you're gonna have fun
so one essential is
some sort of really really good lotion
because your skin is going to be getting
so dried out from the Sun even if you're
not getting a lot of color I mean I wore
sunblock
all week and I still got a lot of color
I mean there's only so much you can do
to prevent the Sun if you're out there
you know what I mean so I went and
picked up the Banana Boat moisturizing
aloe after-sun lotion and it was around
five dollars and it's a pretty big
bottle and I like that it has a pump and
I've been using it ever since like the
couple days into the vacation when I got
it up until now and it's been so
moisturizing it definitely takes a while
to kind of buff it into your skin but
just bring something like this some sort
of really moisturizing lotion that you
like I typically don't use just aloe
vera because for me it feels makes my
skin feel like it's pulled tight and
just dry and I don't know so this has
aloe in it but it also is like vitamin E
and other really moisturizing
ingredients so I really really liked
this I know that Hawaiian Tropic has one
and like the little green model but it's
kind of pricey for what it is and it's a
really small package so I went with this
and I'm happy with that
so another thing you don't want to
forget is deodorant oh my goodness
deodorant I've been using the secret
outlast clear gel and I've never used
gel before I love this stuff I've
mentioned in a previous video I've tried
some of the natural deodorants they just
don't work on me I don't know I really
like this stuff I'm sure it's not that
great for you because it certainly does
prevent any sweat it you know prevents
any odors or anything I really like it
so if you're still if you're kind of
searching the market and you don't know
what to get this would be a great one
for you guys for you to try okay woo
alright so another thing you don't want
to forget your razor that would be
terrible
for a beach vacation think about how
much skin is showing I'd be so sad if I
didn't ever razor
I like the Quattro I got a really
good deal on it and I really do like it
but you know any razor that you like for
my hair that entire vacation and even
today it's still like half wet but I've
been air drying my hair I never air dry
my hair
like I let it air-dry isn't doing makeup
but then I'll finish by blow drying and
styling like I use this combination and
I loved it I used the Moroccan argan oil
from organics so any type of oil that
you really like and what I would do is
after I washed my hair I would like
brush my hair out and then I would put I
just dropped it I would put that in my
hair especially focusing on the roots
but really getting it everywhere and
then I would spray it with the not your
mother's beach babe texturizing sea salt
spray and my hair would just be really
nice just like as it dried it'll get a
little bit better as it dries some more
but it's just kind of wavy and
comfortable and I didn't have to worry
about you know spending a lot of time
getting ready because I never you know
you don't want to spend an hour and a
half getting ready on vacation at least
I don't so it was so nice to just do
that and know that my hair would be fine
after an hour would be dry I'd be good
to go the shampoo and conditioner that I
used was a really moisturizing one
because just like your skin your hair is
gonna get really dried out from the Sun
so I wanted to replenish that moisture
each time I wash my hair I was using the
john frieda brilliant brunette of course
if you're not brunette you might not
want to use it but there's no color
deposit on these I know there's a one of
the blonde ones in this line does I
think it's the sheer blonde go blonder
it does deposit some color but these
don't and I know they have one for red
hair too I didn't necessarily notice
that like the brunette my hair was
really brought out but I did notice my
hair was very moisturized and I think
this is part of the reason that the
combo of the other hair products really
worked was because this was a really
nice shampoo conditioner okay another
thing oh your face is gonna get so dry
so bring really really deep moisturizing
lotion for your face I use the vitamin E
cream by vital care I keep bringing it
up because I love it i depotted it into
a smaller container but it's wonderful
it's cheap but just get something cuz
like right now my nose and my forehead
are so so dry so dry so I was glad I had
that because it would have been worse
off you know so I had two more things to
go over I'm gonna go over what I put in
my makeup
that's pretty much all you need for a
beach vacation and then what is in my
beach bag so I'll do the makeup bag
first I really didn't bring that much
because at the end of the day I really
didn't wear makeup every single day
I always put some sort of sunblock on my
face but when I wanted a little bit more
coverage I used the maybelline dream
fresh BB cream and I have mine in the
light sheer tent and it has an SPF of 30
is the main reason I used it you can
just apply it with your fingers you know
it just goes right on and it it gets the
job done and protects your face however
if you want a higher SPF which really
you probably should then you'd want to
go a different route or put some luck on
under it and then this on top which I
did sometimes as well but the only other
thing I would really wear if I just
wanted a little bit to the beach would
be that and then some eyeliner mascara
this is the Physicians Formula black
it's just a you know retractable
eyeliner it's not necessarily waterproof
although that would be a better option
but it didn't really budge when I wore
it and then I also wore the Maybelline
one by one just because it really
separates your lashes I've really fallen
back in love with this mascara you're
gonna be seeing this a lot more it
separates your lashes just kind of just
simple it looks like you got a little
bit on but nothing too crazy or
voluminous I really really like this so
those for the three I would wear like if
I really wanted something on my face on
the beach but when I like if we went out
at night I would add just a little bit
more to it I would to my cheeks I put on
the hot mama blush and really any blush
that's got some shimmer to it because
you know when you're on the beach it's
just kind of or even out at night
especially and it's warm it's just nice
to have a little pop of like shimmer you
know on your face and then I would also
you know because I was kind of greasy
from the Sun and from sunscreen I would
use my studio fix powder foundation from
a Mac I'm an NC 20 but anything that's
more of a mattifying powder is going to
be great to just kind of be slick your
face and then on my eyes I would use the
Maybelline Color tattoo in barely
Brandin all over my lid and then if I
wanted a little bit more drama I would
use my wet and wild comfort zone palette
typically I would stick in the greens
but there's all kinds this is great to
travel with because there are so many
options but if I just wanted you know a
little bit more drama and that's what I
would use and then for my lips I just
brought a color whisper and lust for
blush it's one of my favorites it's just
pretty much here but there's a little
bit of that blush color to it and it's
just really moisturizing for your lips
and then I also brought a mac lipglass
in fresh air which is really kind of a
sheer peach color I guess I can swatch
it for you guys it's really pretty so
yeah so that's all I brought by way of
lips and that was the makeup that I used
because you know like I said you don't
want to fuss that much with it you don't
want to have to worry about it okay so
on to my beach bag one thing that
doesn't really fit in it because usually
I'm wearing it is my big floppy hat I
bought it from shop lately and it was
trying to think of how much it was it
got all bent up like 14 dollars I think
and they still they have lots of colors
but I just love it you can really kind
of form it to the shape that you want
and it works really well you can fold it
up like as small as you want it and it
doesn't really like mess up the shape of
it or anything so that's one thing some
sort of hat if you like hats because
they're fun they really can shield your
face from the Sun really well and I
think it's important another thing you
want to make sure you bring is just some
foolproof simple sandals I think the
flip-flop type is the easiest because
you can slip them on and off so easily
you know to and from sand or even out at
night I like I went with a sparkling one
because you can wear them out at night
and then during the day it works too so
this is pretty much all I wore on this
vacation I brought a pair of tennis
shoes because I also ran while I was
there but other than that that's all I
want you also don't want to forget your
bathing suit I usually go with simple
plain colors not always I have some of
the patterns which I'll show you but I
pretty much just get plain colors
because then you can mix them match them
really easily you can do the same thing
with patterns
- but it's just fun I like I have a
plain white suit a plain black suit and
that I have some colors because it's
just kind of fun to color-block like
that and then like this one's a fun
pattern one and I like to mix it with
this bright red but yeah just bring some
suits maybe two maybe three depending on
how long you'll be there but there's a
washer and dryer where we wear which is
nice so I could kind of do that you
don't want to forget your beach towel
this is one that has Minnie Mouse on it
that my boyfriend Tyler got me but you
definitely wanna bring one of those that
would be terrible to forget it right I
also always throw in my beach bag so
sort of like dress cover-up and
sometimes I'm wearing it out and then
I'll take it off and put it in my beach
bag but this one I just got at t.j.maxx
it's just a simple tie-dye one it's got
kind of a funky hem which is nice but
you know one that's just kind of
comfortable it's not necessarily
form-fitting but I also don't really
it's not my taste to wear like the ones
that are kind of like muumuus you know
what I mean so this one was kind of a
perfect in-between comfortable it's not
too short it's not too long and it
wasn't very expensive so I'm not too
worried about if I'm getting it all
sandy or ruined or anything like that
that's not that big of a deal so some
sort of cover-up Beach reading material
I always bring a novel and I always
bring a magazine or two cuz duh I mean
come on
good and then by the way this is my
beach bag it's just a really simple
small yellow and it's not too big so I
don't need to bring that much with me
actually it's from Clinique and I really
like it because it has this zip up
waterproof pouch inside of it and you
can snap it off so if you want to take
it out you can which I really really
like so and of course all of it is sand
and waterproof you know but like I said
this zips up so you can put like your
cellphone or keys or wallet whatever you
need in it but this is my favorite
favorite sunblock it's the Hawaiian
Tropic SPF 30 plus sheer touch sunscreen
it is the type that takes a while to
blend in but I just I like the way it
smells SPF of 30 seems to be really
perfect for me so I can get a little bit
of color but not be burnt to a crisp you
know I just really really like it it's
just classic and there's something about
this bottle that's just so like it makes
me think of the 70s I don't know why but
I really like I know I was a good
anyway also another thing I always have
in my beach bag or like some hair ties I
love these kind they're just so simple
and I just love them and then chapstick
oh my gosh
something with SPF whatever you use on
your lip says SPF you have to use
because you know there's nothing worse
than burnt lips so I always bring my
chapstick classic it only has an SPF
before however they also sell some that
have SPF of 15 and then of course
there's millions of options out there of
lip products with SPF so baby lips for
example is one of them so there's tons
of options like that and of course just
one second let me get my sunglasses you
also want your sunglasses and these are
my Steve Madden ones I actually lost
these and then and why I knew where they
were but we couldn't find them that
doesn't make sense but it does anyway
these I got at Burlington Coat Factory
and if you have one near you they have
crazy good deals on nice sunglasses
because these were only like $10 so I
just reball the exact same pair because
I love them because they're just classic
black they go with anything in their
huge so they cover my face so those are
my essentials for a beach vacation I
hope you've learned something new and if
you have different essentials I would be
very interested to hear about them
because I should be going on another
beach vacation in October for a wedding
so so let me know down below and I hope
you enjoyed this and thanks for catching
back up with me after my long hiatus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
