have my next installment in my everyday
makeup drawer seriously I haven't done
one of these in so long and I've had a
lot of you guys asking like what
happened in that series it's one of my
favorites it's one that I came up with
on my own or at least I like to think I
did but a lot of people do them now and
it's so exciting because they're one of
my favorites to watch it's kind of it's
similar to like a shot my stash where
people will go through I just show you
the one drawer I've got that I like
every morning I open and that's where
most of the makeup I'm using for that
month is in so a lot of its new stuff
that I'm trying out or maybe it's stuff
that I kind of forgot about or it just
got lost in my collection so I'm trying
to remind myself to use it or maybe it's
just something I'm trying to use up so
let's go ahead and get into it so this
is what my everyday makeup store
currently looks like I've got a little
container that's holding everything that
I got from Target in the closet
organization section it's under $10 and
it's got three smaller on that side one
big one in the middle and then two kind
of medium sized compartments in it and
it works really well to hold a lot of
makeup but let's zoom in closer and look
so right here I've got some butter
LONDON
products these are they're kind of a
funny name yeah lippy bloody brilliant
lip Kranz and so they just sent me all
these jammies I'm so excited about so
I'm thinking of doing a review lip
swatch video soon on these so I've got a
big purse that I can try them out
because I haven't even really tried them
I just watch them on my hand and then I
also have some glory on lip glosses in
here the reason they're in here I
actually bought these at the Dollar Tree
a few months ago it was in one of my
Dollar Tree makeup haul videos and
they're kind of getting lost in my
collection and I actually really like
the formula so they're in here so I and
remember to wear them and then I also
have
it cosmetics what does it call
celebration foundation illumination
powder foundations and it's just really
really nice I haven't been using it and
I need to because it is really good so
that's why that is in here and then over
here this goes out of the way I've got
like my Anasazi a brow pencil I've got a
master conceal from Maybelline because I
haven't really given it a fair shot yet
since I hauled it so I want to try this
this is an Edward best concealer that I
got on hope look so I'm trying that out
it's doing a great job of covering up
like and bowls and stuff I don't really
use it for under-eye because it's a
stick concealer and I don't really like
this one around
that's not my L'Oreal infallible gel
liner that I love I've got my one of my
favorite foundations the Rimmel lasting
finish this is their shimmering skin
Perfector in opal I've been using this a
bit I find it it's not hard to work with
but I haven't found my favourite way of
applying it but it is absolutely
beautiful like I kind of get why
everyone was freaking out about it then
over here I've got like my ELF makeup
remover pen my Too Faced lemon drop and
this again I got on foot look a while
ago and I kind of never really tried it
out it's got like a yellow color to it
but I've been using it lately and it
does a great job of cancelling out like
veining on your eyes before you put your
eyeshadow on so I really have been
liking now and then I've also got some
mascaras I've got my NYX skinny mascara
that you guys know I love the one is
this the Maybelline full and soft I'm
trying out really liked it so far it's
got a really nice brush to it I just I
like this mascara it's a really great
everyday mascara then I've got this
Becca resurfacing primer and I've heard
good things about as well my NYX
control-freak Groucho and then just some
like like a seal liquid liner and a
liner from gorgeous cosmetics it's just
black that I'm using
back here I just recently got keep
bringing up whole look but that's where
a lot of this is from Too Faced was on
there recently and it was like 50% off
so I got like this for $16 and these are
usually like 36 this is their romantic
eye palette and it's in their old
packaging but look at these colors
they're so beautiful
and these are
so crazy pigmented isn't that ridiculous
and I love to face shadows so I was
really excited to get that and give it a
try so I've been using this then from
Influenster I got a YSL like primer and
it's got glitter in it but it's kind of
amazing it's really been holding onto my
foundation for a long time so that has
been pretty cool then I also got the Too
Faced little like highlighting beads
that they have I can get it open that
you kind of use like highlighting pearls
so that's been pretty fun to use and
then they're bronzed and poreless and
then this had gotten lost in my
collection this is the elf baked blush
in pink tastic and it is this
unbelievably gorgeous champagne
highlight and it's so creamy now I will
say some people like I've gotten some of
these baked products from ELF and
they're not as like creamy but if you
get a good one like this one is really
really creamy and buttery so it's kind
of hit or miss which is bizarre then
this is one that I got in one of the
boxy charm of glossy box it's at your
minerals just like translucent setting
powder that I'm trying out and then back
here I've got some lip sole which is
like this beeswax lip balm from Sweden
and I heard about it from Holly it's
lipstick here on YouTube who is lovely
and she loves this stuff so I it is
really nice I only use it a couple times
then I've got my Els sweet mint that I
love some tweezers a pencil sharpener
and then back here a subscriber sent the
unique like lash extending fibre set and
I have to admit I am impressed I was
really really skeptical but now I'm like
okay I get it it's actually it does
lengthen and then I also just have these
two faced solve eights blush bronzer
demos the blush though is so small in it
that you kind of I mean I pretty much
just use the bronzer but the blushes are
beautiful too but I mean I think it is
that you can kind of mix them and it's a
blushing bronzer but I don't
but this one is in Ross and Rachel and
then this one that's got like a peachy
shade as in Carrie and from Sex in the
City so I was so excited to get those
and they were so cheap on Hulu so that
is everything in my drawer hopefully you
