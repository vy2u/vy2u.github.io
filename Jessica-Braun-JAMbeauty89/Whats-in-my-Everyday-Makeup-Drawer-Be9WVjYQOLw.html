bringing you a brand new segment yet
again I'm kind of I'm very inspired
lately so um I asked on Instagram I
posted a picture of what is in my makeup
drawer that I use kind of for every day
and I asked if people would want me to
film a video about it and they said yeah
it should be I think one person
recommended I should do it kind of on a
regular basis so this is the drawer that
I go to either I'm in a rush in the
morning and I'm like I just got to put
something on I don't want to be reaching
through you know how many like eight ten
different drawers to get a blush and an
eye shine on this at the other so in
this drawer I put a lot of things that I
know that I love that I can just grab
quickly and put on and know that I'll be
good to go that being said a lot of the
drawer are things that I know that I
absolutely love and some of the products
I could say maybe a third of them are
products either I'm trying out because I
want to review soon or I'm just trying
out because it's new and I just want to
try it out so I'm gonna go ahead and get
right into it I'm going to show you
what's in that makeup drawer so here we
go so the you know that this is kind of
my makeup station where I get ready I'm
actually uploading a video or I know I
used to have my everyday compartment
over there but now that's my blushes
because I'm right-handed it made more
sense for me to put it on the right side
my everyday drawer so I now have it over
here and I'm using an organization
compartment from Target it's in the
closet organization section it's around
$6 and I love it it's got this big
compartment in the middle three over
here and then like two medium ones here
so back in the back I have my everyday
little headband thing that I used to
hold my hair back as it air dries for a
bit after I get out of the shower and
then just an extra kabuki brush Beauty
Blender these things that my friend
Alexandria sent me I can link her
instagram below she also I can link the
video where I opened this cuz she sent
me a bunch of things was so sweet of her
so that is from her and okay let's dig
right in so I've got like my in estate
anastasiya clear brow gel I use every
single day my eye primer that are you
also use every day my Jordana
this is what I'm trying out my 12 hour
made to last liquid eyeliner pencil it's
in the black color black point I like it
so far but I'm still kind of trying it
out and then I also have like a liquid
liner in here Physicians Formula that I
like it's not like a Holy Grail but I
like it I also have the elf makeup
remover pen I use all the time for
mascara messes the L'Oreal magic Lumi
not a Holy Grail but I'm just using it
some more just to decide how I like it I
thought I had another one in here oh it
flew over here
whew it's the essence long-lasting
pencil in bling-bling this is a Holy
Grail I used it almost every single day
on my lower lash line because I don't
typically do a harsh line on the bottom
and then I also have the Lancome Hypnose
star mascara it's a trial size that I do
love and I just kind of rediscovered so
I'm trying it out it's just about done
for so I'm kind of using it up before I
toss it so I think that's everything
over here
in this compartment I have the wet and
wild cover all Foundation which the
video I'm actually uploading right now
so it'll will already be up when you see
this I talk about this and why I love it
so much so that's in here and then I
have some lip products this is a
Palladio lip gloss that I love in the
shade babydoll so what it is yeah the
shade babydoll and then more of a peach
color a mac lipglass in fresh air and
then this is Mac creme Cup that I love
it's just kind of a just a very neutral
kind of chill color I really like it
those are in there and I usually have my
wet and wild nope
my hey umm what is it oh the maybelline
color whisper in lust for blush was in
here but it's now in my purse because
well I use it all the time okay so down
to here I have three different bronzers
in here which might seem excessive but I
don't know I'd like to have some options
so my hoola bronzer is my all-time
favorite still then I have the Tarte
Park Avenue princess and I also have
this one the covergirl bronzer in copper
radiance this is a beautiful beautiful
bronzer that oh my gosh I just love it
and it's kind of gray tone too which is
really nice if you don't like an orange
II bronzer so then I have a couple
blushes here this is a Mac MSF and lust
that I love and then the Milani baked
blush and dolce pink which is my
favorite Milani blush which is funny
because this actually comes across more
pink on me and this comes across more
peachy so it's kind of funny they look
the opposite but then I have some
highlighters my mary-lou manizer which I
also used for like a lid shadow and then
my Mac MSF and soft and gentle then I
have my Rimmel stay matte and
translucent that I use pretty much every
day and then my Mac Studio Fix powder
that I use when I need just maybe a
little bit more coverage then just like
the stay matte so then over here I've
got my L'Oreal blackest black cream
eyeliner that I use all the time
and then my erase paste from benefit
this is an elf HD powder and corrective
yellow that I just put in here that I
use to set my under eye a lot my
Anastasia brow duo powder it's in medium
brown and I my goodness this is an
everyday product for me then over here I
just have a couple I shadow options like
this Sonia Kashuk six pan palette and
perfectly neutral it's just perfect I
mean it's perfectly neutral you guys
they nailed the name on that shimmering
sands trio from covergirl gorgeous and
then this wet-and-wild single and brulee
I use this is old I use every day to
blend my shadows together then over here
these are just like my no-nonsense
products ones that I use all the time my
hula brush I used for contouring that
I've just recently discovered or let me
rephrase I've recently started actually
using it and it's great for contouring
and then my Beauty Blender that I live
and I actually just did a video about a
$5 dupe for this that's pretty close so
I'll link that below as well and then
just like one of these little things
again my friend Alex sent me these and I
use this for cream shadow she
recommended and it's great my favorite
favorite favorite lip balm the Smiths
minted rose I love this it's only like
six or seven dollars online this is just
chapstick tweezers and then my vitamin E
cream that i depotted and then over here
I have my eye cream that I use every
night the Mogador nurturing eye cream it
smells amazing - and then my news Regina
healthy skin so I have basically two
options for foundation the coverall and
this in this drawer this one is getting
to be a little too dark though so I need
to
shade lighter which I'm planning on
doing because I have a coupon and then I
have my two naked palettes just because
well frankly I spent a lot of money on
them and I do love them and I want to
make sure I'm using them all the time
but I really do just reach for them all
the time anyway so it made sense to put
them there and they fit really well so
that's pretty nice so that is everything
in this drawer so I hope that was
helpful for you guys and that you
enjoyed it I know I like watching these
types of videos which is kind of fun to
see what people are using I think that's
why I also like seeing people's face of
the day post on Instagram which I do as
well just cuz it's fun to see what
people are actually using you know
especially people on YouTube you see
them talk about a lot of products but
I'm always curious like okay but what
are you actually using in the morning to
get ready do you use that mascara every
single day or are you just trying it out
and then never using it again you know
what I mean so I think these are just
fun to watch I hope you enjoyed it too
and hopefully in a couple weeks I will
be posting yet another one of them with
kind of updated products that I'm using
so I'll see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
