my gym bag video for you and just tips
on how I organize it what types of
things I bring with me if when I'm gonna
go work out and so I just leave this
actually in my car like in the trunk of
my car
and that way anytime I feel the urge to
go to the gym or anything like that I
always have everything I need with me so
this is the bag i used it's just an
adidas light pink one basically just a
duffel bag my boyfriend got me like two
years ago and i think they still sell
this exact style so but it's just an
open bag and if you look in its not it's
pretty organized it's just hard to kind
of tell that it's organized but you can
see my shoes and my different piles of
clothing and things like that so let's
dig in shall we
I have my shoes here and these I'm a
runner for the most part and so I am
constantly buying running shoes and so I
used to spend a lot of money to get
Mizuno's but um I don't know I just
realized I still wear through those
shoes really quickly so I figure it's
better to spend my money a little wiser
so these are a Avia shoes I got em at
Kohl's they're great I've had them for
like a year now and they're just as
wonderful as the day I bought them it's
insane and I do have inserts in them
because I do have high arches and so I
get oh I just have a lot I get shin
splints easily and there's just a lot of
things so but these I haven't had any
shin splints since I've had these
they're great either play did have white
laces and I always replaced my laces
with colorful ones because it's just way
more fun you know it just adds a pop of
color and Pink's my favorite color so
just happy so love these and inside my
shoes I always keep my lock I'm just so
I can always find it cuz usually it's
lost at the bottom of my bag drives me
nuts so I just started leaving it in my
shoe alright so I also have this little
pouch it's got Minnie Mouse but I use it
to hold my jewelry while I'm working out
so that way I don't lose it doesn't get
all lost in the bottom of the bag I also
have this bag I got from Sephora just
have things in it but inside I keep all
of like my gym toiletries so got
deodorant of course and this is my
favorite right now it's the secret
ph-balanced spring breeze it's like the
third one of these I bought I really
like it
um this was actually like a handmade bag
from Cambodia but it's just a cute
pattern but I hold all my hair things
bobby pins hair ties and even like
elastic band
things got week passes for my gym for
friends hair spray this is the Tresemme
tray to spray it's great it's a little
travel size so it doesn't take up much
room but it gets the job done not a big
fan of the smell though this is the sexy
little things into our body spray which
I always have some sort of body spray
with me again another travel size so it
doesn't take up a lot of room a lotion I
always put lotions in here that I'm just
wanting to get rid of whether travel
size or not just ones I'm not a big fan
of this is the Beyonce heat it came with
the perfume which I used to have and
it's you know it gets again it
moisturizes which is what I might need
it to do and it smells nice but it's not
my favorite lotion and then I also keep
feminine products in there cuz you never
know when you might need them so that's
all that's in that bag um and let's see
what's next I also have sports bras whoo
and then into the clothes oh well I also
have socks and you can get really good
deals on nice athletic socks like Puma
and Adidas and feel I mean there's just
all kinds from Burlington Coat Factory
Marshalls t.j.maxx that's usually the
places I get these my favorite kind of
these Puma ones I have like quite a few
packs of these but they're just really
simple but they just they hug my feet
the right way and they don't like slide
down my heel but I also like these these
are some champion white socks that I
really really like some c9 ones I think
I think so I always have at least one
pair of running shorts these are the
kind that have the built-in mesh thing
they're just comfortable
I don't wear shorts that often at the
gym just because I don't know I always
feel like a little awkward I know that
sounds weird but I just do but I always
keep them just in case and then I also
have okay this is from the Victoria's
Secret Sports line which is called vsx
and they're these are these long long
leggings so they go all the way to my
ankle and they're form-fitting all the
way down but they're wonderful for yoga
there
wonderful for running I mean they're
surprisingly comfortable and they are
high-waisted though so you got to keep
that in mind but that line is expensive
but if you wait and get some good things
like during the semi-annual sale which
when I got my stuff there really nice
quality so I also have from the vsx like
these these are shorter capris so
they're form-fitting and then they're a
little looser from like the knee down
and they just have this really pretty
like shimmering metallic band at the top
it's just so they're so comfortable and
so cute and again really well made and
another thing that you guys commented
when I posted a picture of me wearing
this on Instagram this is from the
Victoria's Secret Sports line and it is
this amazing workout top and it has a
built-in bra which is really nice and
it's just crazy comfortable I mean I
can't even describe this to you I would
buy this in every color except for as
expensive anyway so I also just I always
bring an assortment of different colors
and like I have a dark maroon one this
is from the c9 brand I know target sells
its by champion and so is this one I
think maybe um this one I just like the
pattern I think it's so fun um and then
this one is actually from Old Navy which
I think those shorts I just showed you
were also from Old Navy they have their
own active line and this one is great
because it has these black panels on the
side so it makes you look even thinner
not that it really matters how you look
at the gym but hey it's nice you know if
you've passed the mirror and you think
hey I'm looking pretty good let's keep
on going I don't know and then I also
just have a plain black one but yeah
that is all it's an empty bag there yeah
so I hope that you got some tips of what
kinds of things are helpful to bring
with you and how to organize your gym
bag sort of it's kind of difficult
because it is just an open thing you
know there's no pockets or anything like
that but you know you make it work um
but yeah I hope you learned something
new and if you guys would like me to do
