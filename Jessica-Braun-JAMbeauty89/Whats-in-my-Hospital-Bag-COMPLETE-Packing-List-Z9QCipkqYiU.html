to share with you what is in my hospital
bag okay please don't be fooled it
doesn't all fit in this bag I had grand
plans I was like even though this is
your first baby Jessica you can fit it
all in one bag you can do it girl
because I am a pro Packer when it comes
to traveling my husband and I travel
he's a traveling I have gotten very good
at packing minimally however this is a
life experience I've never had and I'm
so like I I want to have everything I
need and I know the hospital I've
already done the tour they showed me
their rooms I asked all kinds of
questions I know what they have and so
there are certain things I will mention
that I'm not gonna bring because they
have this blah blah blah but they're
just a lot of things I wanted to bring
so I'm gonna share them with you please
know that because this is my first kid I
probably am bringing more that I need if
you want to follow along when we
actually do have this baby we are
planning to vlog on my husband's channel
which is Tyler travels TV here on
YouTube I will link that below as well
we are planning to vlog kind of the
delivery and not like the actual but
that whole experience and being in the
hospital and all of that and putting
that on his channel so again stay tuned
for that definitely go subscribe to his
channel so you don't miss those kinds of
updates as well so um we will actually
let me start I'm bringing actually a
rolling suitcase and I might as I get
this more truly packed because I kind of
just got it in there I wanted to show
you guys this stuff and then I'm gonna
really get it all packed in and ready to
you know next to the door for whenever
we actually need it so I am 38 weeks
pregnant and I'm just I'm excited and
actually at Tyler my husband's on these
packets okay shut up just can't get into
this so first thing and I will link
anything I can find below because that
helped me so much as I was preparing
because I don't you know you don't know
what you don't know and it's really hard
to pack for something that you've never
been through before so first thing is I
packed three which is probably overkill
but I know for sure that it's 48 hours
after I give birth that's how long I
stay in the hospital that much I know
for sure at least at my hospital in my
state so I packed three nursing bras
these are softer ones I was asking my
sister about these and she had bought
some on Amazon which is where I bought
these and it was like a three pack so I
will link these below but I
is wearing them the other day just to
kind of get used to them they're really
really comfortable I got a size medium
just because that would be like a size
up for me but there's plenty of room
there's plenty of stretch you can take
the padding in and out and of course it
has the clip so that you can undo it and
nurse with it etc and I like that it
came with pink nude and black so those
they're really comfortable they're
simple do I think they're gonna last me
years and years probably not like
through multiple kids I don't know but
regardless I was like that's that's
perfect for what I need so that is
definitely in there I also packed what
I'm going to wear from the hospital home
now I really struggled with this because
I thought I know that I'm still going to
have a lot of weight to lose I mean
you're I'm still going to look probably
six months pregnant when I leave the
hospital so I thought what am i
comfortable in when I don't feel stellar
with my the way I look and my first
thought was a maxi dress and yet again
my same sister had bought this dress in
a different color pattern from Amazon
and it was like I want to say around 30
bucks and I ordered one in a size small
and it's not technically Maternity
however it it's it cinches in at the
natural waist and there are pockets and
then it's all just flowy down to the
bottom it is the most comfortable dress
I've been wearing it super pregnant and
it does stick out a little bit like
oddly because it's not met you know the
it's not cut at the like like an empire
waist it's more you know meant to be for
someone that's not pregnant but it still
works and so I thought this is perfect
because I know it fits me now I know it
would fit me not being pregnant so kind
of being in that in-between postpartum
stage I'm gonna feel really comfortable
wearing this home and I've already worn
it I've washed it so I know it fits me
well stuff like that so again I'll link
this dress cuz they have a lot of
different colors and I thought perfect
okay I've got to like not talk so much
another thing I am bringing my own
pillow I bought this set I kind of
regret buying it after doing a little
bit more research and let me explain why
so I bought this set which was it came
with a pillow case and of course it's my
own personal pillow but it came at the
pillow case and then it came with a
matching hospital gown and you could
pick the pattern and it was really cute
and I was like 35 bucks I kind of regret
it because as I did
research after buying it and now I'm
like well I've already washed them
because I washed the pillowcase in the
gown everyone was like you know what
you're gonna get the hospital gown so
messy you're not gonna want your own and
then some people said well you could
just use the hospital gown give birth
and then afterwards you know you're
still kind of in hospital gown
change into this for a little while like
I guess so now I'm kind of like I guess
I'll bring it we'll see if I end up
using it I'll have to let you guys know
you know India and maybe I'll do like an
update to this video like what I packed
in my hospital bag and what I didn't
even use you know that kind of a thing
so I'm gonna bring it cuz now I own it
but the pillowcase is cute and they do
say to bring a pillowcase that's not
white so that way when they're taking
linens and putting fresh ones on they
don't accidentally take your pillow or
pillowcase so that at least was cute and
you know I do like it but I kind of feel
like that was a little bit overkill one
thing I heard a lot of people say they
bring is a robe this I bought on
HauteLook and it's a really long kind of
a luxurious looking silky robe but I had
some credit on HauteLook and I was like
no but I buy like everything I owned
from hautelook it's from bed to brunch
and I got it in a size medium so again a
size up from what I would normally wear
it's a robe but I liked that it was
longer and I liked that it was longer so
that I didn't feel like you know I've
still got a belly poking out I have a
very specifically maternity robe that I
you know I just use when I get out of
the shower here at home and I was really
concerned that you know it kind of
sticks out and I wouldn't feel
comfortable walking around in that robe
in front of like other people but this
one was longer and it wrapped more so I
figure even with a little bit of weight
it'll still cover everything and it just
feels a little more feels a little more
private so and I figure that's that just
makes me happy it's it's a pattern I
really like - bringing a laundry bag and
this is one I had from when I went to
college up in Chicago so laundry bag I
figured it'd be good to just anything
that's dirty I can kind of put in and we
don't have to put it back in my luggage
we can take it out to the car when we're
done with it um oh I also am bringing
nursing tanks now these you don't really
have to wear a nursing bra with I I'm
just gonna have to go buy what I'm
comfortable with because
I again I don't know but these again
we're on Amazon in a three pack and what
I loved about these particular let me
show you a color because it's a little
easier to see came with black gray and
purple and I think they have ones that
were like three pack of black and three
pack and gray as well but what I liked
about these and as I read the reviews on
Amazon was that its inches right under
the bust but then it's loose so yet
again when you're feeling self-conscious
and kind of just weird kind of deflated
there I figure this would be nice and
semi loose it's not gonna be super
fitted because that is exactly what I
don't want I won't be cut I know myself
I won't be comfortable like that so I'm
gonna go ahead and bring all three again
I washed all of these before I'm taking
them but I'm gonna go ahead and bring
all three because I don't know you know
how dirty will they get things like that
I would bet I'll go through at least two
and then having one extra wouldn't hurt
and it actually is kind of cute it has
like a little lace design in the back
and again it's a nursing tank so you can
undo the strap and nurse and then pull
it back up so yeah I would say I guess
now that I'm saying this out loud you
really wouldn't need a nursing bra with
it I did bring two 90s see this is where
I'm overkill because it's only gonna be
in the end pretty much two nights I mean
kind of however that well it'll
definitely be two nights because even
labor
regardless however it crumbles I'm not
it's not gonna be more than two nights
unless like I had an emergency c-section
in which case it would be three so I was
really torn on what to bring because
right now I'm really comfortable
sleeping in 90s so I have this Jessica
Simpson maternity kind of night dress
and again it's a nursing one so even in
the middle of the night if I'm sleeping
in it I can snap it down nurse and then
snap it right back up so this is one
that I know I already wear so it'll fit
fits me now it'll definitely fit me
after and it's just kind of loose and
cozy and then I had a black one that's a
little bit longer because yet again this
is the shorter one and if I'm kind of
walking around the room I don't know I
don't know why I'm so self-conscious
about that but I am so I have two
different nightie so that's something
that oh the black and Eydie by the way
it's not a nursing one but I bought it
at Target I'll see if I can find it it
has a both of the pads are on one side
right now umm it's just kind of larger
and a little bit longer kind of me
I'm length kind of hit it'll hit you
like to your calves but it just looked
like it was really cozy and comfy and I
liked that it was black so maybe that
first night when I know you know
there'll be a lot of fluid coming out of
me I might feel a little more
comfortable with something dark so it's
not as obvious if I stand up to go to
the bathroom these are the things I
worry about anyone else I know that when
I have this baby in my arms I'm gonna be
like Jessica all of those worries were
done but regardless they're there so
this is where it's overkill because I
also was like well what if like during
the day I want to wear like sweatpants
so then I've got sweatpants which I
guess I could wear this with like a
nursing tank and there again they're a
size up or two - I got a large in these
sweatpants the brand is Ocean Drive it
doesn't matter the brain you could go to
Goodwill and get sweatpants but
definitely getting a size or two up
because I wanted them to be loose and
comfy and then some really loose cozy pj
pants i have two of these I love them so
much
even my husband's like those look
comfortable the brand is PJ Salvage I've
been getting them in a large for
maternity but their regular pajama pants
they're not maternity but they're so
loose and comfy and just breezy I oh my
gosh I have to so I've got one still in
my PJs or that I've been wearing and
then these are packed away I just want
to make sure I'm comfortable that's
really all this amounts to so I also
brought some tees I'm I really just
wanted to bring this just to bring it
it's a Britney Spears tee is this too
much I think I might not bring this but
I also brought a pink maternity tee just
in case those nursing tanks like maybe
I'm cold or I just want a little bit
more coverage like maybe I've got family
coming over so I've just got a plain
pink shirt and I can just throw on with
the sweatpants just to feel a little bit
more covered up for a little while while
they're visiting oh then I did buy I'm
bringing of course a couple pairs of
socks just socks that I really like I am
bringing some slippers I'll show you in
a second
and then I did buy a 3-pack of kind of
larger undergarments very exciting stuff
just because they say I might need them
I might not depending on what I decide
to do when it comes to like after birth
with what they provide that you can wear
like the
ones or pads things like that so I
figured this was you know semi
inexpensive but really I was more
concerned about just comfort even when I
go home the you know that first week or
two
I really don't own a lot like this like
at all I don't own any like that so I
figured that was probably a good idea to
bring a few just in case even for
afterwards even for when I get home
but again I can link those below cuz I
also got those on Amazon um so beyond
that I was told to bring slippers to
walk around in some that have like
almost like a sole on them and these
were on Amazon and I fell in love with
them they're I don't even know what
animal they're supposed to even be but
they are so flippin cute I want to say
there are under 15 bucks and I'll
totally wear these at home too but I
figured this would just be one of those
special little treats I get to wear at
the hospital and it's like all these are
cute and then I'll have them for after
but I thought they were cute they fit me
really well they're really cozy and like
I said they have some treading on the
bottom so if I'm needing to walk around
I'm not going to be slipping everywhere
and then I'm also bringing a pair of
flats I don't know you know if I'm going
into labor I would hope I would think to
wear just like cozy shoes I'm sure he
would but just in case I figure flats
are perfect because I can slip them on
and off even to go home in they would
work fine with my dress so and they take
up virtually no room
so this brand it's Madden girl and the
it's the style Erika and they're just
really cozy flats and then I'm also
bringing some cheap flip-flops pretty
sure I bought these in like Las Vegas
when my heels were hurting me but just
in case I want them for the shower
that's really all I think I need to
remind my husband to pack that too I
don't know you would assume that they're
clean but at the same time kind of
better to have them and in case you need
it alright so another thing that I
haven't seen anyone bring but I thought
I feel like I should just some grocery
bags and the reason for these is if I've
got really soiled laundry that I'm not
wanting to throw away I'm actually
wanting to take home and wash but I
don't want them to just be touching
everything else even in my laundry bag I
figured these would be really good to
have to just kind of wrap them up and
then put
laundry bag so I know that they're still
in there but they're not getting stuff
all over the other stuff so that's kind
of my own advice I assume that I will
probably utilize these so in their free
I'm also bringing a belly bandit now I
don't really know a lot about I'm gonna
be honest I really don't know a lot
about this some friends of mine have
sworn by these and say they really
helped with slimming back down after the
baby I've heard some people put him on
right after having the baby I've heard
some people wait a few days some people
wait weeks I don't know I figure I'm
gonna bring it I will bet I'm not gonna
put it on in the hospital unless you
guys down below or like no you totally
should but I I need to do some more
research but I figure again it takes up
no room I'm bringing the info card with
it - it takes a virtually no room so
I'll bring it just in case I decide -
and if not then I'll just do it what I
get home but I'm curious to see how this
does help another thing I am bringing is
a really cozy sweater it's just an open
one this one's from Old Navy it's even
an extra small but it's it's kind of
oversized and it's longer and I figure
again that's one of those things I can
toss on if I'm cold it's one of those
things I can toss on if I'm cold in the
hospital it's a little thicker than like
the robe I brought because I didn't want
to bring a big plush robe I don't really
I don't always wear plush robes except
for my special one my husband made me
and I'm not gonna bring that one to the
hospital with me so this figure is gonna
end up being probably worn a lot and so
this is where it's also overkill but I'm
thinking okay I'm gonna have a lot of
family there at the hospital visiting
what will I feel comfortable wearing and
this is my own personal preference I
have not seen anyone pack this kind of
stuff in a hospital bag I haven't so I
might end up realizing at the end maybe
I didn't need it but again it didn't
take up much room and I figure I'm just
gonna throw it in I packed two looser
cute shirts and two pairs of comfortable
leggings I have so many leggings and I
figure I can go a few weeks without them
they can be packed away but basically
it's too comfortable loose outfits I can
wear these shirts are longer kind of
tunic style so they would cover my bum
and stuff
in the leggings which I also like and
I'm really just bringing it because I'm
like if I want to look a little more put
together like I think of like my
father-in-law visiting and I don't know
I would want to be covered up a little
bit more than just a nursing tank and
sweat pants so with that in mind I'm
packing these I will have to again let
you know if I ended up wearing them or
not we'll see and then a small cardigan
as well to go with those if I want or
just I don't know I guess if I'm cold
again I kind of had a little extra room
in the luggage I'm also toying with
bringing that my travel blow-dryer
this one's from t3 it's got a little
diffuser they I know for sure they don't
have a hairdryer I asked them and you
know after the first day after I've
showered and I'm feeling I mean not
perfect but I'll certainly want to look
a little bit better than maybe I did
during labor so we can get some
semi-decent pictures with family and the
baby so I'm thinking about bringing this
but I also air dry my hair like this was
my hair air dried so that's why I'm kind
of like I might not bring it we'll see
but I know that most hospitals do not
have that so if you were curious alright
so moving on to what I call my carry-on
bag even though we're not flying
anywhere but the pink one you actually
saw this is mostly like my toiletries
and then also entertainment kinds of
things so like my Kindle and my laptop
will be in here because I figure during
downtime I can edit video because we're
gonna be there have some playing cards
for my husband and I to play cards you
have oh I don't even remember where I
got this but it's just a hilarious
little I was gonna call it a pub but the
ears make it look like a French Bulldog
but anyway this little doggy pouch and I
just got my headphones my charger for my
phone charger for my Kindle and like a
little block for a USB to go into the
wall so I just kind of got all of those
together so I don't accidentally forget
them in the rush to leave and then I've
got oh I brought some nursing what do
they call these like pads
if you will to kind of stop like if
you're leaking a little bit it doesn't
get everywhere and then also some just
straight-up pads just in case again I
have a feeling I'm not gonna need them
at all I know that they'll have plenty
there but
gives me peace of mind knowing that I
have them in here that's all it's for my
own peace of mind I'm also bringing my
Kindle and a book to read I'm bringing
two magazines honestly I don't subscribe
to magazines but somehow we've been
getting shape and I figure I might as
well throw them in there I'll probably
look through them and then be done and
recycle them but figure better to have
it if I'm just super bored out of my
mind I've got these and then I'll
probably just leave them behind toiletry
wise this is where I went a little crazy
because I'm like this is my world this
is what makes me feel comfortable makeup
and toiletries and while I know I'm not
gonna be in full glam makeup during or
after Labor I know that in the days
after I'm gonna want to be able to feel
more like myself again
so I love this bag it's the Macbeth
collection by Margaret Joseph and it's
just really cool this is a newer bag of
me I bought specifically for this and
then I'm sure I will travel with it so
you unzip it and it opens up and then
you can just hang it on the door so
there are a lot of hanging organizers
like this but I liked that everything
was kind of confined here so I'm
bringing a some hair ties I actually
bought this pack this bag of bag this
little thing of scrunchies but they're
like smaller scrunchies and like that's
kind of cool
so I definitely brought hair ties and
bobby pins and a little headband to hold
my hair back and a little washcloth I
always used like when I'm doing my
makeup and stuff I like to have I don't
want to ruin someone else's towels and
stuff got my hairbrush I've got a little
mirror that I always bring when I travel
because it can kind of just sit like
this and I can actually do my makeup
nail file my toothbrush so then I'm
bringing some things that again are
probably overkill but if I could do it I
know I would just feel like so I'm
bringing a couple of face masks I'm
bringing I mentioned this in a recent
video because it's such an expensive
mask the tatcha luminous dewy skin matte
skin mask and I said you know what I'm
gonna bring it to meet with me to the
hospital because that would be when I
need to treat myself more than ever and
then I'm also bringing this Lancome
hydrogel mask and then some Shiseido
wrinkle resist eye mask figure will
destroy so I also have deodorant my
favorite is the Schmitz fragrance free
it's natural and it actually blocks the
smell it doesn't block the sweat you'll
still sweat but it genuinely I never
smell when I wear and it's one of the
only brands of natural deodorant no the
only brand of natural deodorant that
works mitts it's amazing they have smelt
they have ones that smell too but I've
been enjoying fragrance free while being
pregnant and frankly I might even enjoy
it after cuz it doesn't compete the
smell doesn't compete with my perfume
you know so shampoo and conditioner I'm
bringing this living proof anti frizz
shampoo and conditioner that way I
figure even if I air dry my hair it'll
help with frizz and things like that I
just picked up this Olay little body
wash at the Travel section of my local
grocery store and then I'm bringing this
shower oil I really do like this amond
shower oil from L'Occitane so I'm
bringing that I'm bringing o some more
bio oil this I literally had just bought
another one I was like you know I'll
just put what's left in my hospital bag
and this one because I've heard a lot of
people say to put it on right after
birth because that's when a lot more
stretch marks can occur so I'm gonna
keep that roll in and then the palmers
cocoa butter formula massage lotion for
stretch marks I happen to get this in
the mail you know from some actually I
might have even gotten them when we like
did our baby registry so I'm like it's
perfect I will bring that as well I have
not been using this however I think I
used this early on in my pregnancy but I
I know I haven't used this lately
bringing a hair spray this is my
favorite the Bed Head masterpiece
hairspray that I use even when I do air
dry my hair some contact solutions some
dry shampoo from Amica
body lotion this is the Kiehl's creme de
corps i got this like in a little
Christmas stocking stuffer set and are
you actually it's a very simple
unscented lotion which again is kind of
perfect for this situation also bringing
some lip balm that was like the number
one thing so many of you guys told me
don't forget lip balm and don't forget
hair ties because when you are in the
throes of Labor your lips will be so dry
and your hair is gonna be everywhere so
I got my Kiehl's lip balm
Oh a couple specifically postpartum
things that I've heard good things about
this is the earth mama nipple butter
I've heard is amazing I don't know that
I would need it in the hospital yet but
I again it was small I figured I would
just toss it in here and then the earth
mama herbal perineal spray to take care
down there so you can kind of spray it
and it helps soothe and things like that
and I'm also weird I really like loofah
so I bought a new small loofah it was
like a dollar I figure I'll probably
just throw it away when we leave the
house but I'm not gonna bring it back
with me but I'm not a fan of washcloths
I don't I don't know why and I knew this
would make me feel more like I'm at home
than if I were had to use a washcloth so
then I also have in these front they
have like this these three little
portions in the front I have my contact
a contact case I should say not mine cuz
I have my regular one here for me to use
in daily life my toothpaste I use
Sensodyne pronamel it's my favorite and
then I really kind of did a lot with
skincare because again I figure my skin
is gonna go through the wringer and I
have all these travel sizes why not use
them and I've got really nice brand
travel sizes I was really excited to use
so I'm bringing perfume probably won't
use it cuz I mean I don't think the baby
should be around that really but I've
got the belief boy stur izing eye balm
and then I've got the Sunday Reilly's
CEO moisturizer teeny tiny babies of
them then I my makeup remover I'm
bringing I love this stuff this is the
origins original skin cleansing makeup
removing jelly I have I've gone through
like two full sizes of this and I happen
to have a travel sizing like that's
perfect or moose or make it really well
you don't need wash cloths or anything
like that I mean you just need water
I'm bringing the Sunday Riley ceramic
slip clay cleanser I've only used this
like a couple times and my skin was like
eh it's okay but I don't want to go I
don't want it to go to waste
and I just need something to cleanse my
skin so I figured this would be perfect
but I don't know that that's worth the
price tag so I'm bringing a couple
things I'm bringing the Lula Henriksen
truck truth serum not trust serum truth
serum
because I figure my skin will want that
brightening I'm bringing the belief
Hungarian water essence and I'm bringing
the karez Wild Rose sleeping facial so I
love sleeping facials because you can
just put them on your skin and sleep and
they just kind of sink in overnight and
that's that I'm also bringing this way
treatment masque for my hair cuz I had
it the way finishing cream and oh no
it's cracked it's not this is the
Moroccan oil treatment but I have a tiny
size so like I said total overkill on
all this stuff but I have peace of mind
knowing it's all there even if I won't
use it that's just me oh the last
portion of this and then I'll talk about
the few baby things I'm bringing if
you're curious I'm not bringing a lot
just because the hospital the nurse was
like seriously we have everything you
need for a baby all you need are cute
outfits like if you want to take
pictures over in it or to like take her
home in that's it you don't need it and
so I'm like okay so I'm genuinely not
bringing much so I'll show you that but
this is the Jujubee makeup bag
honestly I bought it on HauteLook
because it was a really good deal
because everything's like 50% off on
that website but if Jujubee happens to
be like a diaper diaper bag brand but
honestly I just like the pattern it you
don't need a diaper bag brand of makeup
anyway but what I really liked about it
is that I could put my brushes up there
and my makeup here and it was all
together and we were done so I'm gonna
try to go through this quickly this is a
long video I know I am bringing the Too
Faced natural eyes palette
it's got shimmers it's got mattes do I
think I'm gonna use this a ton no but I
I know that I really like this palette I
loved the original and this might be
even better to be honest and I'm also
for really pretty much the rest of my
face I'm bringing this hourglass ambient
lighting edit veldt lighting ahead at
volume 3 because it's got bronzer it's
got blush highlight it's got it all in
one and I don't need a bunch of separate
pieces and then I'm bringing my Smashbox
primer oil cuz I love the way it sinks
into my skin it just makes everything
look a little bit more glowy and then
I'm also bringing my enemy powerful
priming serum it's kind of a more not
shimmery but kind of shimmery in a way
priming serum that you put all over your
face
I'll put on on top of that oil and then
I'll usually go in with a foundation but
this is a little bit lighter coverage
because I figure I don't need a full
coverage foundation in the hospital so
this kind of looks more like a tinted
moisturizer on my skin
it's the Physicians Formula healthy
foundation and it's got it's got a big
doe foot I can just quickly kind of put
it all over my face and then I brought
my L'Oreal pink sponge that I can just
quickly dot it in and it my skin looks
so much better with it on I've got
another lip balm just in case I lose the
other this is the Hanalei lip treatment
I freaking love this stuff just bring in
my NARS radiant creamy concealer not my
favorite concealer in the world but it
is one that's really quick it blends
into my skin quickly I can just dot a
few dots and I know that it always works
it never really looks gross or cakey and
so for that reason I am bringing it also
bringing a moisturizer this is the
cosmetics humidify deep moisture this is
a crazy expensive skin care product you
guys but it is such an amazing
moisturizer I did my top 13 skin care
products which I can link that video
below like my Holy Grail I forgot to
mention this is so many you guys were
like Jessica what about that cosmetics
moisturizer I'm like I totally forgot
cuz I keep this in my makeup drawers
than I I just didn't see it when I was
thinking I don't know this stuff's
amazing but it's like really expensive
I'm embarrassed to say so I'm also
bringing this origins ginseng eye cream
it's my favorite when I'm getting ready
in the morning it's got a little bit of
like a beige tint to it and so I can
just kind of Pat around my eye and it
kind of brightens a little bit I use it
every single morning I love it I also
like to spray this first thing on my
face this is the pixi vitamin wakeup
mist and you just spray it everywhere
it's kind of like an essence and I've
become a big fan of that I'm bringing my
L'Oreal lash Paradise mascara this
actually a brand new tube I'm just kind
of I just put it I opened and I put it
right in here it's my favorite mascara
it's so freaking good it's so volumizing
your lashes look like velvet that's not
the right word like fluttery and full
and I just love them for my brows I'm
just bringing my hourglass arch brow
pencil in ash that's the shade I wear
it's what I'm wearing today I wear it
every day and then my favorite my NYX
epic ink liquid liner I am bringing a
powder this is the Physicians Formula
youthful wear if I feel like I just
maybe I'm a little bit too oily or maybe
I just feel like I need a little bit
more coverage this youthful where does
provide a little bit of cover just more
of a powder foundation and then brush
wise am I not bringing it oh I am
bringing a pencil liner I was gonna say
what this is the pretty vulgar eyeliner
pencil really really creamy again you
don't need to spend the money on
something like this I'm doing like a
full on make it review it's a really
creamy great eyeliner but you can get
one from L'Oreal that's just as good so
my brush is I'm bringing a the Luxy 5:22
I love this you can highlight with it
you can bronze with it you can set your
under eye with it you could do literally
anything and it's I've got a couple of
this shape that I like so I'm bringing
that and then for my blush and bring in
the chic blush brush from it cosmetics
this is the it brushes for Ulta and then
I'm bringing my Dell iam tools 958
powder brush for powdery and it's from
that golden triangle line that I love
and then I'm also bringing this a 23
Anastacio brush you can highlight with
it again you could do anything with it
but that's what I use it for and then
the golden triangle from Delhi I'm tools
the 785 this is my favorite I brush for
the crease I can just fluff stuff into
the crease really quickly and I looks
pretty much done it's really really soft
and then the only other eye brushes I am
bringing are the Marc Jacobs the crease
brush this one I have more than one of
its so good if I did want to do a little
bit of outer corner it's so precise but
still soft and fluffy and then this is
the elf I think they call it like just
the eye shadow C brush or something I'd
like to set my brow bone with this and
then this if I wanted to smudge some
color on the lower lash line the Sigma
short shader e 20 when I'm bringing a
lash curler of course this is just this
the tweezerman lash curler that I really
like so for the baby I'm
I was gonna bring like the full-on
diaper bag I'm like I just I don't need
it there's so much in there that I don't
need right now they have plenty of
diapers and wipes they've got onesies
and they've got blankets and they've got
you know all of that stuff you need so I
figure I'm just bringing this small
little bag and it just got some clothes
for her so one thing I am bringing
however but we'll probably leave in the
car until we're like ready to go with
the carrier so we already have the
carrier installed of course and that you
know you bring in to the hospital put
the baby in they make sure you you know
got it all lined up right etcetera and
then they said to make sure you have an
appropriately weighted blanket well I'm
due at the end of May close to the end
of May and this is kind of a heavier
blanket but it's one that my sister made
for her and so I'm gonna bring it we'll
see I figure well if it's raining we
might want it it's probably not I mean I
mean we'll see but I also have like it
just an a swaddle blanket that would
work too so I'm bringing this but I will
probably just leave it in the car for if
we need it but this was a bag that a
lovely family friend made for me at my
shower so I'm bringing um one little
sleeper these are so little and of
course I washed all of this with dreft
beforehand so it's ready to go but one
little newborn sleeper in case we need
it again that's probably one thing we
really don't need to bring but I had a
little bit more room bringing a halo
sleep sack again probably won't need it
because they have everything we need but
I figured I had a little room I would
bring it and then like I said I brought
an Eden and an A and I whatever swaddle
blanket this is from the Minnie Mouse
collection that my sister-in-law and my
brother bought for us and sent over and
so I snagged one of those out of there
and that is what I'm bringing which will
probably use so this is where I'm like
okay I went a little crazy because I was
like well what outfits do I want to see
her in so I brought a couple of cute
hats that we can put on her I know I
stuffed some like a couple mittens a
couple newborn socks a couple of cute
bows to take pictures of her in so one
outfit is that I'm bringing us this
little newborn like strawberry outfit
and then I'm bringing this navy blue
little bow we can take pictures that
might be here going home out
honestly because we can get pictures of
her in it but also it's you know it
would work it'd be appropriate for the
season another one we got is called
Disney the new princess has arrived and
I'm putting it with this little tutu
this would be more for pictures is that
not adorable and then having this little
bow to put on her head with it okay this
one a subscriber made it's so cute it's
ridiculous so I'll be Tyler and I love
Disney he's a Disney travel agent so
I've got a little onesie and then to go
with it someone made her a little Minnie
Mouse like crocheted or knitted little
skirt diaper cover with a little
freaking tail are you kidding me and to
go along with this adorable Minnie Mouse
thing she made a hat for her with little
ears so I'm like oh oh yeah that's going
with us all right it was such a I we had
such a hard time going through the
newborn clothes and like deciding what
outfits I'm also bringing - burp cloths
just to have that I really really liked
and then like I said yeah just some
socks and mittens that are already
washed and ready to go for when we go
home but also if we just need them while
we're there so again this is a bag that
might not even come with a in with us
until towards the end when we're like
alright let's take some cute pictures or
you know whatever but we really are not
gonna need it
Oh last-minute things that I have just
recently kind of put in the area to
actually pack my memory book and the
only reason I haven't even started
filling this out but the only reason is
that I want them to when they're
stamping her feet that they can go ahead
and stamp them into this as well her
little footprint so I read a lot of
things online people said oh yeah just
bring it and odds are when they do it
they will stamp it in your book for you
too so I figured well we'll bring it
again it doesn't take up much room then
I'm also bringing a notebook I have and
then all of these things we got from our
childbirth labor and delivery class with
different positions for labor and
positions for you know getting labor
going all of that stuff I you know if
I've got the time and we'll see
I'd like to organize into maybe more of
a folder instead of just shoved into
this notebook but I knew I wanted to
bring a notebook anyway so right now
it's kind of all in one and we'll see if
I reorganize before I actually
get into that so I'm tired you're tired
that was way too long of a video I'm
can't believe you stuck through it I
meant to do this so much quicker you
guys I'm so sorry but if you step all
the way through thank you I will link
anything that I mentioned that's
relevant or that I can find links for
down below so I hope this was helpful in
some way I know like I said it's kind of
a lot for this but I it's what I need to
feel comfortable and to know that I'm
not gonna need for anything while I'm
here just it maybe it's like one of the
few things that makes me feel at peace
because there's so much unknown going
into this and at least this I know what
I'm bringing so if you're curious how my
pregnancy is gone I have been doing
updates along the way so I will link any
relevant pregnancy updates down below
other than that I hope that you will
subscribe if you enjoyed and definitely
check out some of my other videos I'm
planning on filming a nursery tour as
well I don't know if that's already up I
will link it below if not stay tuned I'm
not I haven't decided the order of this
