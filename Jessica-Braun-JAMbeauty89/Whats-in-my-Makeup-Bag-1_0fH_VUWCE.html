going to do a what is in my makeup bag
that I keep inside my purse that's so
specific isn't it um anyway so I've
already showed you this bag if you've
seen my what's in my bag video which I
can link below but this is the Marc
Jacobs bag that was sold at Target when
a lot of the Nordstrom designers did a
collection for Target and I think Marc
Jacobs had this these bags there were a
few different colors and then he had a
black scarf that I that was really cute
and I didn't end up buying kind of
regret it now but anyway um yeah so
that's what these are so this is the
rose gold one and says Marc Jacobs
really small if there you can't see and
I like these because they're decently
thin so you if you you can really easily
fit it inside your bag which it really
likes okay so first things first I keep
like my medicine and things like that
like I leave an ibuprofen and just all
kinds of things that you might need like
cough drops and then I also keep these
little flossers in here you can get like
a bag of these at the dollar store
naturally um okay so but this bag I hold
in my last video or a recent video
recent video this bag was only $1 at
Walmart and it's so cute and it's
perfect for that
so I also have a lotion with me now in
the winter and fall I usually keep like
a L'Occitane or something that's really
really moisturizing like a hand cream
but in the spring and summer when I'm
not as dry skinned
you know I just use like a regular
lotion from Bath and Body Works anywhere
this is the one I'm currently using
called carried away I've mentioned it
before it just smells nice and it's so
nice for spring and summer just a breezy
fruity smell I really like it um I also
always have hand sanitizer I'm in the
works to become a teacher and so I'm
around kids a lot and you know I'm just
anodizing right now I just came from
school makes sense right anyway so this
is my favorite scent this is the
up-and-up ran by Target and these are in
their travel toiletries section and they
only have a few cents but this is my
favorite this is Crisp Apple they also
have another one called
honey P which is like the sweet P doop
but this is my favorite scent it just
reminds me a fall which is my absolute
favorite season anyway so I really like
these because they're 2 ounces and
they're like $1 ish from Target and like
the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works one or only one
ounce so they're half the size and
they're around the same price if you get
it on sale so you get double the amount
they're great and these this kind is
surprisingly moisturizing my hands
always feel they never feel that dry
alcohol type dry feeling they always
feel really nice after I use this so I
would recommend the Target brand um I
also always carry around with me ok this
might sound weird
well unfriendly I am a little weird so
whatever this is the Sally Hansen
diamond strength nail polish and I look
I just dropped it I am caught it that
was so impressive with one hand this one
wasn't doing anything it was all this
one Oh
anyway it's been a long day ok so I
really really like this because not
specifically this one this one's nice
but any glitter polish to carry around
with you because if you get like a chip
in your nail polish and you know how
that just drives you crazy I know it
does for me if I've like all my nails
look good and then one gets chipped I'm
just so mad at that one nail but this
you could just make an accent nail out
of it and it would hide any
imperfections a glitter polish would so
you can just do that mail maybe do a
matching you on the other side and bam
you would never know and if all your
nails are a little chipped like mine are
today um you could just cover them all
in glitter even on the go it dries
quickly you know you're good to go and
it looks fresh and you feel a little bit
better about it so I love to just carry
that around with me I used to try and
get whatever color I paint my nails just
put that in my purse but I never kept up
with it was just insane I would end up
with all this nail polish in my purse
what I'm gonna do with that
so glitter has solved the problem and by
the way wet-and-wild has a really nice
glitter polish on there like mega shine
mine I think it's called like
hallucinate or something like that and
it's a really really nice glitter polish
it's like 99 cents so okay so if I get a
little oily on the go which I typically
do especially in these warmer months I
really like these blotting sheets by elf
they're a dollar for 50 sheets and
they're just these little sheets you
know you pull out and just kind of blah
on your face
- and it just soaks up the oil and again
for a dollar 450 um you can't really
beat that I've literally not had to
repurchase this yet I haven't gone
through it and I use them a decent
amount but I haven't run out of them um
so love those now if I need even more
I'll usually use that and if I still am
a little Gracie I'll use a powder and so
this is what I've been carrying around
with me mostly because it's a powder
that I really don't like it's okay but
it's a Revlon Colorstay powder and I
like that has a mirror with it so I can
see what I'm doing and then it also has
like an applicator but this is a really
really crummy like I mean it's like out
of all the like sponge applicators that
come with powders this is the worst one
I've ever like so like shoddily made but
this is great so I can at least apply it
because I don't really bring brushes
around with me that's that's a little
bit too much for me at this point but um
so whatever powder I'm not liking I
throw it in it gets the job done it d
s-- liquify is my face so yeh I always
of course carry a nail file because my
nails I swear always chipping so this is
just one that I got in a two pack from
Target but I like that it has two
different course grading coarseness
gradients if you will there's like one
that's a little bit smoother one that's
a little bit rougher so depending on if
you want like shaping or if you really
need to get rid of a big old snag in
your nail you know you never know what
you're gonna need eyedrops dry eyes um a
rollerball a perfume this is the only
rollerball I own because when I first
heard of rollerball roll their balls I
was like oh snap like that is like
awesome because I would use like these
like little sample size perfumes you get
tons you know I've just got tons of them
and it's great cuz you know they might
be perfumes you're actually using ones
you like and they're nice perfumes but
they would like explode in my purse or
like the little lids on the ones that
are just like the ones that have the you
know I mean would just come off
everything would smell like that perfume
and that always happened when it was a
perfume that I wasn't that Fonda Oh so
this solves that problem these don't
explode you know what it's like twisted
on and it's just great this is from Bath
and Body Works it's Japanese cherry
blossom I got it on a really good deal
it's not my favorite scent but it was
the only one they had of this at the
time and it smells good and frankly I
would rather smell like this than like
smelling like the gym so I'm liking that
eventually I want to maybe get a
rollerball of some of my favorite
perfumes but for now I'll take it I
carry on my elf makeup mist and say I
just recently hauled this repurchased
this I guess I should say to really like
it just refreshes your makeup especially
if you know you're halfway through your
day you still got a while to go and your
makeups looking a little dull or your
face is just looking a little grey this
is great it just rejuvenating I really
like it and it's $3 high well Belle also
something I've been using so much lately
is the chapstick classic just not
scented not medicated just the classic
and I've noticed a complete change in my
lips like it's just they're so
moisturized and so I don't know it's
amazing
and so now when I'll use lipsticks I you
know they look good on but before I was
using all these kinds of like medicated
chap sticks and they could just weren't
doing the trick I used like aqua for
blistex Vaseline you know just tons of
things but this I'm really loving so I
know target sells a pack of like four of
these for three dollars which I'm
planning on buying because this one's
almost gone and then I can keep one in
my bag and on my vanity and my
nightstand over there and like in my car
I don't know it's just nice to have them
everywhere you are you know um so oh I
always carry on mascara with me usually
one that it like that's a trial size
just cuz I don't use it on the daily and
this one I'm not I've tried it like once
it's the Smashbox hyper lash mascara and
this is the brush if you can even see it
it's literally like the brush is
non-existent it's I don't know I wasn't
big fan so I figure and it'll do the
trick for like touch-ups but I'm not
gonna ever reach for it for real so I
just throw it in there and when this
goes bad I'll just get another like
travel-size one and throw it in I always
cure on eyeliner because that seems to
be the one thing I end up wanting or
needing to touch up throughout the day
other than like powder or like getting
oil off my face I this is just the
covergirl perfect point plus it's an OK
eyeliner but I mostly got it
specifically for my purse because its
retractable it doesn't it's a pretty
thick black line I mean it that was the
worst swatch in the history of
you guys see that wisp off oh I'm just
I'm so on it today it's not even real so
there we go there's my awesome I like
hunt
oh man it's been a long day anyway but I
also like this because it has a smudger
on the other side so you know you can do
a few things with this one tool so I
really like that I can't even get over
that swatch it's just so good you know
it's just so good okay my favorite oh I
always carry around bobby pins in here
ties just kind of wrapped around them um
because you never know when your hair's
gonna look crazy or it's just gonna
start raining and you've got to do
something different with your hair
Oh last two things are lip products my
favorite Revlon lip butter peach parfait
and I've shown it before I can I oh I
have it on my lips I forgot I'll really
go buy some it's just so ooh
it's just so nice it's just so no fuss
beautiful wears off nicely same with
this this is the NYX mega shine lip
gloss these are like four or five
dollars at Ulta or online it's in the
shade beige but it's really pink and I
just let's see yeah that's kind of a
it's this sheer pink but it really looks
nice it wears off nicely which is key
for me because you know I put it on in
the morning or whatever I have the
chance to put it on it's gonna last for
a little while and if it's not going to
I can't be reapplying it all the time
you know so and I'm sure everyone's got
that issue so those are two products
that I don't have to worry about the way
that they're wearing off I don't to
worry about reapplying something after
an hour they always look good
so that is off that is an empty makeup
bag who got a repackage anyway I hope
