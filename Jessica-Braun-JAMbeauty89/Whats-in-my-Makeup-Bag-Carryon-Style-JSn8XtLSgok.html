going to share with you products that I
brought with me on my most recent trip I
used to share like my travel makeup bag
with you guys every time I travel but I
do travel a lot my husband is a travel
agent so we're constantly on the move
and so we just got back from Vegas and I
felt this is a good trip to kind of
share with you guys what I brought
because I brought some things that you
know I wanted to look my best when we
would go out at night so I brought some
of my absolute favorites but I also
brought some kind of fun products to
play with because again we were in Vegas
and you know different glittery tech
products different lip colors so I
thought it'd be fun to share and I'm
also going to share with you guys what's
in my liquids bag for my carry-on I'll
do that at the end and I'll let you know
where I got these two different bags
that I'm using so this might be a long
video so strap in grab some tea water
coffee whatever and let's go and get
into it okay so the first thing that I
brought doubled my makeup and my brushes
although I'm not showing the brushes in
this video I just washed them and
they're all drying right now in the
other room but this bag is by Sophia
Choi and I got it at Target very
recently it's probably still sold there
but I liked it it was kind of like easy
to clean and it was big enough there's a
little handle if I wanted to hold it
that way and I thought the colors were
kind of cute too and I liked it had gold
hardware some of these things were when
I traveled in my liquid bag I'll try to
tell you which things had to be in here
but I wanted to do all of my makeup
together so one of the things I brought
that was in my liquids bag is my Mac
prep and prime fix plus spray I knew I
wanted to bring some kind of setting
spray this one just happened to be a
smaller size which is the only reason I
brought this but I actually didn't use
this all over my face
I used it to dampen my brush to apply
like a lot of what glittery really
pigmented shadows and things like that
so that was really the main reason I
brought this I probably could have done
without it but I did use it moisturizer
that I brought that again was in my
liquids bag was the glossy a priming
moisturizer I just liked it because I
could use that as my moisturizer at
night after I can't clean my face but I
liked it of course I could use it right
before putting on makeup as well when I
got out of the shower so that was
perfect and the regular size of this is
only 1.7 ounces so I could bring it and
put it in my
carry on because I did not check a bag
speaking of gauthier I also brought
their balm calm and it's just like
they're universal it's not one of the
scented ones but it was just the only
lip balm that I brought and that was in
my liquid bag
I also I brought two different primers I
brought my from my milk makeup blur
stick for like my nose region anywhere
that I like to fill in my pores and it
was nice you know this is not something
you have to put in your liquids bag
which is nice I'm going to get tired of
saying like with bag pretty quickly this
is the Catrice prime and fine
beautifying primer this is quickly
becoming one of my favorite primers
because it's like this kind of pinkish
tone to it but of course when you blend
it in it doesn't look pink but it has
this really pretty finish to it that
just I don't know what imparts this glow
to your skin but it's not shimmery or
glittery or anything like that and I
just have really fallen in love with
this so really inexpensive if you can
find it they're just starting to get
sold in the United States so it's a
little harder to find Catrice so I will
link below if I can find it online but I
really like this I brought a setting
powder and this I think looking back I
didn't really need to bring this is my
Laura Mercier translucent loose setting
powder it's just so big like I think if
I were to do this trip again to pack a
little lighter I would have taken this
and put it in a smaller like just
container you can buy you know it's
drugstore for like a dollar just because
I mean this is a lot and I don't use
very much of it when I use it so I
didn't need the whole thing so but I
love this powder I use it to set my
under eye just to set my makeup in
general so if we were sweating or
dancing it didn't my makeup just a place
I mean that stuff is amazing at holding
on to your makeup some tools that I
brought my Sephora lash curler just the
standard one
I brought my tweezer men light up little
tweezers for I love these for tweezing
my eyebrows if I needed to I did not
need to another tool is my ELF makeup
remover pen to clean up like any winged
liner I might have done which I
definitely didn't definitely Oh
lashes I brought just my Ardell natural
lashes these are the 120 Demi's these I
had already worn before and I
already cut because I didn't want to
have to bring like little cuticle
scissors you can bring them my actually
my husband ended up bringing some but I
didn't want to have to bring those so I
wanted to make sure they were they were
once I already liked I didn't want to
bring more than one because we were only
there a couple nights and so I really
like these these are perfect for me for
what I like in lashes the concealer I
brought is my tart shape tape it is a
toss-up there were like five I wanted to
bring I ended up bringing this one
though and this did go in my liquids bag
but it's just so good because you can
put a little bit on and get good amount
of coverage put a ton on and get like
crazy coverage it's just perfect for
that
so I was glad I brought that and I did
it's not here but I did bring my Beauty
Blender because I really do think that's
the best way to apply this so that is
also cleaned got a little bit of course
with my lashes I brought my duo eyelash
adhesive this is just a cool stuff that
dries clear it's white and then dries
clear I always get nervous like I've had
the kind that's like that it dries
darker but I I get nervous that I'm
going to get it all over my eye and then
that's going to be dark in places I
don't want it to be so I just go with
the clear white stuff I also brought a
Sephora little sharpener because I
actually needed it for my this is so out
of water I know you guys I needed it for
my NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk I mean I
again it was only a couple days I
probably need need it but I love this
stuff is what I use for my eye primer
under my eye adjust wipe it all off I
just swipe this all over blend all the
way from my brow bone to my lash line
and I love it's white so the shadows
really pop on top of it but it also
holds on to the shadow all day so the
foundation that I brought this is
actually the only one I brought is my
favorite the hourglass vanish Foundation
sticks I love this so much and I brought
it with my brush and I did want to show
you the brush with it even though I'm
not showing any other brushes because
now this video is not sponsored by
hourglass but they did reach out and say
that they'd be willing to give away a
set of these to one of you guys so I
wanted to mention that in this video I
will put the link below for how to enter
the giveaway but I'm so excited because
I know these are expensive and I know I
talk about them all the time
I want you guys to be able to try them
and love them as much as I do so I will
put the info on how to win this down
below
they'll be in contact with you to get
the correct shade to use you're not just
going to be like stuck with some random
shade but you'd win the hourglass
Foundation stick and B brush which I
only I shouldn't say only but I love
this brush and this is one that like I
really do think it makes a huge
difference using a brush that's right
with this kind of a thing and not just a
random foundation brush so I brought
these together that's how I always apply
it so back to reality what I love about
this and the reason I always bring it
with me when I travel is because it
doesn't take up any room in my liquid
bag and it has the craziest coverage and
even though I have dry skin I feel like
it just makes my skin look so nice so
also talking about it but and thank you
our class for being willing to give one
away because I'm so excited so for my
brows I brought my Anasazi a dip brow
pomade and medium brown I just fallen
back in love with this stuff I think it
does such a great job at just spreading
throughout my brows and still looking
pretty natural I think you could
probably still tell like I don't know
that I have something in my brows but I
think it still looks pretty natural and
it's a really good match for me because
I tend to always go lighter with my
brows my brows are naturally light and
this is my natural hair color too like
I've never dyed my hair and I know some
people are like have what it's my brows
it just naturally lighter so I'm always
thankful for products like this that
kind of helped me match it better to my
actual hair color so and I just used a
really cheap elf duo like brow and
spoolie brush it's like a couple dollars
on line now back to my face for a while
the only highlighter brought was this
one that I'm obsessed with from pixie
it's the pixie and Aspen no vard glowy
powder in London lustre oh my gosh oh my
gosh oh my gosh this stuff I'm not
wearing it today I'm wearing a Becca
like purplish one that's new but this
stuff is like the prettiest most blingy
highlighter it just catches the light so
beautifully I just love this so much and
I wouldn't have guessed that I would
love it as much as I do but every time I
put it on I'll catch myself in the
mirror and think oh my gosh the
highlighter looks so awesome so that is
the only highlighter I brought the only
bra
their splash contour powder I brought is
my beloved Kevin a Quan bronzing what
are they actually called sculpting
powder in light I used to use the medium
now they have white my pale skin is very
happy about that but I use this I didn't
use it today but I used it every single
day every single night and I just love
this it's really nice if you do have a
little bit fairer skin it does a great
job of you know it it really is a
conference is more great toned but I
think it's still does a good job of
making you look a little bit fun gets it
away if you apply it in those areas
so I kind of used it for both you know
what I've leaned on a bronzer but you
guys do what I'm saying because I'm not
doing like a kind of a contour kind of
thing you know what I'm saying where's
the blush I brought I only brought one
blush and I brought my Mac blush and
Melba that I recently purchased and I
just really like this I had since gotten
rid of I only have like a couple matte
blushes but this one's just a really
pretty everyday peach and I just liked
the way it looked and I hadn't used it a
ton yet since I bought it and I knew the
matte blush is typically will stay on
pretty well on your face throughout the
day so that was one I took I feel like I
used to I still brought a lot of makeup
I mean there's no getting around that I
brought a lot of makeup but I'm really
proud of myself I used to bring like two
to three blushes and like two
highlighters and to bronzers and I was
very proud that it was pretty easy for
me to say okay now one highlight one
bronzer one blush you know good job Jess
good job and I usually bring like a
couple foundations but I narrowed it
down to one I was pretty proud of myself
oh I lied I brought two highlighters I
brought this RMS beauty living Luminizer
because I love it and I actually used
this we went to a pool party and so this
was the kind of a highlighter I use
because I did still put on makeup like
we're still trying to look cute but I
used this because it was just like you
know you just kind of tap it on its kind
of this glossy look it's creamy so it
doesn't catch the light in like a
powdery way and I thought that was so
perfect so I don't think I ended up
putting any like bronzer or blush but I
did just put this on my face and I love
it
alright let's move on to eyes I brought
one official palette and it's so dirty
and I take that but I brought my honest
Asya Modern Renaissance
the thing was crazy about this palette
still to me is when I originally looked
at this pot like way before I bought it
because I would kind of late to the
party with this one when I would look at
it I was like no like I don't really
like reds and oranges on my skintone but
the more I've used it now that I own it
every time I use it and put up by doing
luck with it I'm like oh my gosh I love
this and so it's really forced me to
step outside of my comfort zone which I
love and so I ended up bringing it and
loving it so I use it every single night
now I did want like a black shadow and
just a couple of other what other ones
well to show you i used my little v
palette i got from boxycharm i love this
size so perfect for travel and I just
picked out nine more shades that I
thought with kind of fill in the gaps of
what this palette didn't so let me kind
of show you side by side so I brought
some like greens and some more I don't
know kind of more browns even though
this does have a few Browns and then I
did bring like a darker black I realized
I don't have a matte black shadow in a
single so I kind of need to get that for
this this one I'd say a little shimmer
it didn't really make a difference but
yes so that's all I brought I shadow
what okay no that's not true because I
brought some other fun single things
oh really quickly I brought my Anasazi a
brow Wiz pencil and medium brown just
said I like to fill in the edges of my
brows with that and I love the tiny
spoolie on this so much and I also
brought my Anasazi a clear brow gel I
probably could have done without this
because my brows don't really move that
much I probably have been fined about
ringing that so more fun stuff for my
eyes that I draw I brought two color pop
shadows but only two I still have I
might have a couple more but these are
two I've had forever and they still are
like the only ones I love I'm not I know
a lot of people have like huge color pop
questions I really don't I own Lee have
like three or four shades and these are
my two favorites so I have I heart this
which is this gorgeous kind of shimmery
silver but it's still like a white gold
silver I love this and I don't wear this
alone I like to put it on top of other
shadow same with this other one in
lovely which is a golden shimmer so it's
warmer it's warmer than that last one
I love these so much but again I don't
wear these alone I always put them on
top of something because I don't feel
like they they never look as punchy as I
want them to look when I wear them on
their own does that make sense so I love
to this that I definitely wore these
like every night they're another fun
single product that I brought with the
elf long-lasting lustrous eyeshadow and
soiree I didn't end up wearing this but
I love it so it's kind of a whipped
cream II texture really kind of odd but
it says gorgeous like burgundy color
with shimmer and the glitter doesn't
there's no fallout which I love because
it's just like in the product it's not
like separate that makes sense and I
brought the thing that I only wore once
but I'm glad I brought even still and
that would be my Mac pigment in tan this
is the prettiest I got to swatch it
every time I open I get excited to
swatch this I'm never going to use all
this in my entire life like ever so you
can get like travel like small sizes of
this I have a smaller size of their
vanilla pigment and I'll never even use
that up and it's like half the price
this is the tan pigment right there so
you could get the smaller size of this
for like I want to say it's around like
10 ish dollars this might be around 20
or you can get the L'Oreal infallible
like loose shadow they have in amber
rush just saying and they say all in the
same amount of time there's really no
difference all right so I also brought I
did bring a lot of like fun I think my
milk pigment in is the after party yes
after party I know some of you guys are
probably rolling your eyes because I
talk about this all the time I'm so
sorry but it's so good look at that if
you put the tan pigment on top of that I
gotta try it I didn't try that I should
have tried that well it doesn't really
make that much I mean it's just even
more beautiful but it doesn't really it
just kind of makes it more tan like but
so so beautiful I think I used the after
party pigment every night now again I
didn't wear it alone I put things on top
of it but I'm pretty sure I wore it
every single night under whatever
continuing on like I said I'll do lips
at the end so the liner I brought is the
hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel
eyeliner
guys I always have a fun in my hair my
hair is like velcro
it's the 1.5 millimeter in obsidian and
I am almost out gold no the bad thing
about this is it runs out very quickly
and I'm almost out
I have other colors of this that they
sent me that's so sweet and I really
like them but I need more black anyway I
love that it is amazingly skinny and
creamy and pigmented and you can just
quickly tightline or you know fill in
your waterline whatever it is amazing
it's so amazing I love it so much
changed my life another liner is that I
brought Oh my Stila stay all day liquid
liner my favorite I brought that that's
what I used to do my wing and I also
brought my L'Oreal lacquer liner it's
their 24-hour black gel liner and I
always bring a brush of course to apply
it with and that is what I mean that's
what I'm wearing today all three of
those eyeliners and I always put this on
as my middle layer to really thicken and
black in the line and this is really
good at covering like if you're wearing
a lot of glitter and sometimes like
other kinds of liners especially that
liquid liners don't cover that this is
really good at really covering that and
blackening that area so that the glitter
is not peeking through your liner I hate
that next I brought the pixie I brought
a lot of makeup I'm sorry guys it's the
pixie extra eye bright liner and it's
like this own pinkish lavender nude
almost white I don't know how to
describe it
but you put this on your the inner rim I
could put it on right now I guess just
show you you put it on the inner rim of
your waterline like on the lower part
especially and it just whitens that area
so if it's a little bit pink when you're
more tired it really brightens that area
and makes your eyes look a little bit
more awake and I love this and they have
like another shade night on both but I
like the extra eye bright one this one
that's a little bit more pink so I am
glad I brought that um oh I brought just
for fun I brought an elf well I brought
a couple of the elf brush cleanser wipes
they're literally like a wipe that you
can just wipe your brushes off on so
then when you put your brushes back in
your bag they're not like they don't
just have nonsense on them and it takes
no room you can just throw it away these
are an amazing invention almost um with
eyes and then we're on to lips I brought
a lot of lip products so I brought my it
cosmetics super here on my scare of my
favorite
I lost the essence last princess one as
well but I just open a fresh one of
these bad boys and I was like I want to
bring that because it makes my lashes
I'm wearing today makes them look so
much thicker and it holds the curl and
it's just so black and I love this stuff
is worth every penny
all right on to lip stuff so I brought
way more than I should've and again some
of this was in the liquids bag oh and
like the milk eye pigment had to be in
the liquid bag by the way the liquid
liner does not I've never gotten stopped
for not putting liquid liner in the back
the like gel liners I've never gotten
stopped for not putting that in a liquid
bag things like that I mean if you look
it up online
like before I started flying a lot and
sharing my bags on a lot I would look it
up online if you like oh yeah any kind
of cream like gel eyeliners need to be
in there no I have never ever ever
gotten stopped for not putting like my
cream highlighter now if it's like a
creamy squeeze out yes you should put
that near liquid bag that's kind of a
good rule of thumb anyway
same goes for lip gloss there have been
times I've forgotten to put I usually
will try to put my lip gloss in the
liquids bag but this time I didn't put
any of these in there and I did not get
stopped so I don't know about lip gloss
I would say it probably doesn't matter
but I brought my to NARS I think I only
meant to bring one but somehow they both
snuck their way in there but I brought
my velvet lip glides I had the one in
bound which is this more kind of like
the same tone as my little sweater thing
here and then I also brought play pin
which is more peachy so I love both of
these it's such a comfortable kind of
almost whipped formula for your lips you
don't need a liner with these colors
they're just they just make your lips
look healthy and pretty and that's why I
really really fall in love with them
what I'm wearing on my lips now and I
actually just had this in my purse is
the Revlon HD Ultra HD lipstick in HD
sand I want
my list right now it's kind of a pinkish
peach really easy kind of a nice smell I
love this stuff I literally wear it
almost every day to work and I never
would have guessed in a million years
that I would love it as much as I do I
haven't tried any other shade so it
really is like I love this shade in HD
fan if you're looking for it every day
like if you like the way my lips look I
have no liner on no lip gloss over it
nothing it's just it and I love it it's
so foolproof so comfortable mmmmmm
and it's so true um alright so for fun
lip colors I brought my Oprah liquid
lipstick in Atlantic City this is just a
really pretty red asked me if I wore it
no I didn't wear it and then I brought a
really fun berry in it's the l'oreal
infallible paints and 326 sultry sangria
ask me if I wore it no I didn't wear it
so then of course to go along with those
the colors that I didn't end up wearing
I brought a red lip liner this is the
Stila stay all day lip liner in Pinot
Noir
didn't wear it and then I also brought
my beauty deep red which is kind of like
a well it's more of like a berry tone
right there to go along with the berry
one didn't wear it but I did bring like
neutral lip liners that I also didn't
wear this is the one wild jell-o lip
liner I love these this one's been bare
to comment it's just a really simple
like kind of peachy nude lip liner a
little bit deeper but I love these
they're so creamy and then I brought my
favorite formula this thing is a hot
mess my colour-pop lippie pencil and
bound and it's more of a pinky nude but
like deeper mauve I just said so many
colors but that is pretty accurate but
again so my problem was like we were
going out I was like I don't wanna have
to with my lips I don't want to
worry about it
so I ended up just going with what if I
even end up wearing I think I ended up
just wearing my NARS thing inbound every
night because I didn't want to have to
be stressed about it throughout the
night and reapplying so I just wore this
threw it in my bag and that was that I
think I might have won this one of this
was probably during the day
awareness anyway so that's everything in
my makeup bag now oh one more thing and
then I'll show you what's in my liquids
bag my it cosmetics your skin no that's
not what is called celebration
foundation illumination in lights this
is my absolute holy grail powder
foundation I love it I'm wearing it
today I forgot how much I love it
because I it's I hit pan on it a while
ago and I didn't want to repurchase it
so I was like I need to find a dress
reduce so I found the Physicians Formula
youthful wear and the illuminating
finish which is really really close I
just don't think this one's a little bit
better but they're really really close
but this stuff is so good it makes your
skin look so flawless and even with dry
skin like I'm wearing today and like up
close like when I look I don't know like
it you can still see that dry skin but
it still looks nice like it's the
craziest most amazing that's still
expensive thing ever
I love it so much I just need to find a
new one so then I can just use this up
and not feel bad about using it up
because then I would have another one
that makes sense let's move on to my
liquids back so this is crazy because
I'm breaking all the rules with this
because when I both have one and they
only had a blue I think three volts of
blue but they have a million of these
options on Amazon for these clear bags
you can even buy them in the store and
some of them will come with like you
know empty little things you can refill
that our travel friendly I like this one
because I'd had a few like this that I
really liked but the zipper kept
breaking and it broke my heart because I
would love them so much and this one
I've recently purchased so the zipper I
wasn't broken yet but the zipper like
when I read the reviews that were most
like oh my gosh the zipper is reinforced
like it's really really good I've used
it for years and I stuff it to the brim
and it saw them broken so I stuck this
doesn't look stuffed because all of my
other liquids were in here and it was
stuffed but these are all my other
toiletries I figured you might care to
see so I will if I can find the link to
this exact bag I will put that below
because I want to say you know it's
obviously more than like just buying a
quart-sized o'clock bag or even a box of
course it but it's more sturdy and if
you travel a lot or even if you don't
but you just want something a little
more sturdy the whole thing
was totally worth the money and I've
gone through enough of the other ones on
Amazon that has kept breaking I was like
I'm not dealing with this anymore I
can't have a broken one to come home
with and all my stuff just falling out
as I go through the TSA line so all
right I've got my toothpaste my crest 3d
white I love this stuff brought the
first date Beauty ultra Repair Cream for
my lotion although I didn't need it
because they had a lotion in the hotel
we stayed at the Luxor because it was a
little bit more inexpensive on the other
end of the strip which is fine and it
was awesome but they didn't have a
shampoo and conditioner and I wish I
would have brought a shampoo and
conditioner because usually you know
what cells have it well they have a
conditioning shampoo my hair was garbage
after washing with that like absolute
garbage so oh my gosh my friend Laura
and I were like dying because our hair
was like parched anyway that is totally
beside the point so I didn't bring a
shampoo conditioner which I have I
finally found travel sized versions at
Target of my favorite favorite face
cleanser this is the serum a hydrating
cleanser I literally saw these at Target
they were ridiculously overpriced they
were like four or five dollars for this
one like you kidding me I still bought
like three because I was like this is my
favorite face wash and when I'm
traveling my skin can flare up you know
like when you're in a different
environment and you're traveling you're
flying and your skin just met it's so
nice to be able to have like your
favorite cleanser ever that's so
hydrating and good to your skin it's so
nice to have that I'm always using
something random because that's what I
have in travel-size so what I looked
brought my favorite hairspray the Bed
Head masterpiece hairspray it's what I
use everyday again I found like a sale
on these and I bought like five of them
so I've got a stockpile of these in my
little travel drawer in my closet there
oh I have eyedrops first my eyes are all
red I have my little like travel o
perfume thing I have currently oh my
gosh it's all so good the chanel Coco
Chanel oh my gosh I love it or the Coco
man boys I don't I love this so much but
this is the easiest thing because you
can just clean it out you could buy more
than one
I have a couple perfumes to choose from
but it's awesome
I also brought a dry shampoo I didn't
end up using so redken pillow proof blow
dry to day extender I've only used this
once I don't remember how I felt about
it but I had it and I was like well I'm
going to need one probably so I brought
it I brought one of my favorites the
Clinique take the day off
cleansing balm I actually just refill
this I had used this up but I just
refill it with whatever like cleansing
balm I'm using I love the it cosmetics
one I actually had a new Clinique once I
refilled it with fat but I love
cleansing balms especially for travel
because they don't spill everywhere you
know I could bring like micellar water
and cotton pads but those are bigger
this is the perfect size and I like that
I can just refill it I brought the
Kiehl's midnight recovery eye cream just
because I have it I like it when I buy a
full-size maybe this is the obliphica
Seabury hair serum I used to help my try
dry hair get some moisture back in
before I blow dried it and I do think
this was nice but that chanceless
horrible and then I brought my glossy a
super bounce serum that I love just a
hyaluronic acid it's my skin loves it
and it was still travel size even though
it's the full size so that was
everything I brought definitely check
