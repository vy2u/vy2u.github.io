very exciting video the brand starlooks
was kind enough to send me their
November star box to review for you guys
and let you know kind of what I think
about it it's a subscription box service
so basically it's you know similar to
Birchbox and tipsy except for there's
kind of a big difference this company
their products are like professional
quality so whereas with it see and
birchbox sometimes you'll get higher end
and sometimes you'll get like drug store
with star looks it's always their brand
of products of course but it's all
professional quality so it's kind of a
big difference and the best part is it's
fifteen dollars a month which is more
than say like it's your burst but again
you get three to four full-size products
and they're always full size they're
never like especially with Birchbox a
lot of times they're just travel size or
deluxe or they'll just be like a packet
of like a little bit of lotion that
always makes me so bad anyway but this
is fifteen dollars which is five dollars
more but they're all full size and
they're all professional quality so
that's kind of a big deal my kind of I
mean that is a big deal at least it is
to me so you can cancel it I'm just
going to give you all the info now that
way I don't have to give it later it's
$15 month you can cancel it at any time
you just join on their website star
looks calm all this info will be below
um and the best part is I was kind of
doing some research on them just to kind
of like I was just curious cuz I really
didn't know a lot about them and the way
I'd heard about them was from my Ipsy
bag the past I think to exceed bags I
gotten a star looks product and both of
them I loved I think both of them were
liners I'd gotten like a regular like
black eyeliner that I loved and then I
got a I think it's their gem eyeliner
and i love that product so anyway I
already knew I liked their brand so I
was really excited the box comes like
this it's real cute so star looks on it
and when you open it oh wow it's got
little things that apparently fly out at
you okay so it says you're trying okay
it's a bunch of info about it
their cruelty free like I said which I
really like so this is their November
star box they've got like a little like
tutorial on how to use I'm assuming
these are the products that are in there
and then it talks about gifts you can
give with them so it's got this cute
little traffic paper that's cute so when
you open it okay oh so it came Oh a
little pencil sharpener it's cute you
can always use those I like this a
little bit smaller it's probably easier
to travel with because the 1i have is
kind of like big and bulky so that'd be
nice um I didn't excited okay so it came
with this they're slanted liner brush
which it feels like heavy like it's
well-made which I'm sure it will be if
it's professional quality like they say
ooh it feels really really nice do you
know what I mean um so it's their
slanted liner brush which is 824 and
it's got this really small I like that I
feel like I might not even use that for
liner I might use it for brow powder you
know what I mean because you can really
get in there with that um I don't know
this is really it feels really high
quality it's really really soft but also
really dense which is exactly what you
want so I'm really excited to try that
out it also came with their infinity
eyeliner the boxes so cute it's the star
looks as you let go around it um so it's
their infinity eyeliner I'm assuming
this is like a gel or cream liner um and
it's in the shade Orion and oh my gosh
okay cute little pot really heavy so
it's I think this is glass it is as
beautiful it might come across as blue
but it's like this deep navy blue that
is really really pretty I'm going to
kind of likes watch it with my finger if
I can oh that is such a pretty color oh
my gosh oh look at the swatch so it
definitely comes off a different color
this would be so beautiful especially
for like a fun look like for the
holidays that is just gorgeous and I
gotta wipe this off um okay so it also
came with this um oh it's a 5 shade
eyeshadow palette
it I hope it has the name of it of
course it does it didn't it's the palate
called Monaco and it looks like this
this seems really really nice okay i
just showed it to you upside down there
pneus says star looks of course okay
look at these colors I'm gonna tell you
right now I got a swatch I knew I would
love it this like solid green or like
topi color here I knew would be my
favorite are you kidding that's like
exactly the kind of shadow can you see
it there oh my gosh okay i guess i
should swatch them all these all this
gold looks beautiful this is awesome
because looks like the white the blue
and the red are Matt and then these two
are like this is almost like a satin and
this is like a shimmer um I'm gonna
swatch the gold one okay this is okay
wow wow these are incredible and I'm
going to show you the olive one on my
phone these are so beautiful so I did a
little price checking and cuz i don't
think it's set it on any of the things
so this eyeshadow palette is $41
originally 41 freakin dollars that's as
much as a lorac pro palette now i will
say these shadows are incredible so i
get that $41 the liner little pot is the
blue eyeliner would have been thirteen
dollars on its own and this liner brush
would have been eighteen dollars these
are all high quality so i get that the
prices are that high however in this box
and then of course I got the sharpener
as well so a $72 amount of products for
fifteen dollars every single month i'm
just looking at all their past our boxes
that they've had and you can see all
those on their website they're all 3 to
4 full sizes never trial size any it's
not anything like that it's just it's a
really pretty darn good deal especially
i mean gosh if you're a beauty blogger
like me or like you know i mean if you
make videos this is a great way to try
out a ton of new products from a brand
that a lot of people have heard of also
it's just really good quality i mean and
i was looking at all their other
products they have a ton of brushes I
and just feeling this one I want to try
more of them so if you want to get the
December star box go on their website
I'll link it below like I said they're
fifteen dollars I think you need to sign
up pretty soon if you want to get the
December one in time now I have learned
and this is actually kind of nice you
can get their past our boxes after the
fact like after they're sent out but
they're $25 so like if I wanted to buy
October star box it would be twenty-five
dollars instead of the 15 so if you buy
it beforehand it's a lot cheaper um so
ooh ooh and there's a forty percent off
any star looks calm purchase here um
that is awesome I might leave I'm gonna
leave this code down below for you guys
if you want forty percent off estar lips
I don't know if that would actually
apply to the star box i'm assuming it
won't but to their other stuff like
these shadows and these brushes are
amazing i'll leave that down below for
you guys as well okay this video ended
up being way longer than i thought but
I'm pleasantly surprised with these
products um yeah so look at all I've got
I need to clean my hands is ridiculous
anyway alright well I will catch you
guys later and I hope this was very
informative for you guys bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
