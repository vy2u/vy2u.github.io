updated what's in my purse video and so
let's just dig right in no point in the
beating around the bush eeeh so the
person I'm currently carrying is this
Steve Madden bag I actually bought at
Burlington Coat Factory quite a while
ago and I've been using it for a long
time because I just love it
and everyone smiles switched back to my
Michael Kors bag that um I think my
original what's in my purse video that's
what I had I know I know that I did so
something just made a really scary noise
and my heart literally just dropped to
my feet
did you guys hear that or see something
fall that was seriously really scary
okay I'm like on edge today I don't know
it just started snowing again and I know
I talked about snow all the time but
that is my life right now
and this has been a really rough couple
of days really I'll probably talk about
that in a second but anyway okay so um
this is the bag i love it and i remember
posting when I first um was thinking
about buying this I took a picture on
Instagram and asked if you guys thought
I should buy it and a lot of you said
yes and some people were like it looks
really cheap I'm like it's not though I
mean it I really love it it might look
that way but I don't think it doesn't I
am just frankly in love with it it's got
the shoulder strap if you want it like a
crossbody of course I never use it that
way but I love the gold pieces and now
I've had this for months and months and
it hasn't shown like any wear and tear
really at all so I'm really impressed
and I really love the colors so the
outside pocket is usually where I keep
my keys and my phone but I am filming
with my phone and my keys are currently
locked in my car my car is currently
broken down it was literally my car
broke down luckily I was like at a
library getting children's books of
course because children's books in my
life as a teacher and I had my carbon
star and so then I'm dealing with it the
way I needed to deal with it calling
toen etc and in the shuffle of things my
keys got locked in the car literally
locked in the car luckily I had my purse
with me so I at least had all my other
stuff so if this has been a
bleep nightmare the past few days so I'm
trying to deal with this and so if I
seem just crazy it's because I am okay
so that's where I usually keep it in my
back pocket that's usually just in there
nothing's in there right now okay so on
the inside if you want to take a peek in
I've got lots of things in there I'm a
decently organized person for the most
part so it usually is this organized I
threw away some gum wrappers that were
in there but other than that
so we'll start one of like the side
pockets I've got my bobby pin that is
magnetized to it I've got my nametag for
teaching and then I've got just like a
pack of gum and then by the way Big Lots
if you have one near you clearly my
favorite store in the universe sells gum
for like 25 cents a pack and they're
like full packs of them like this has 14
pieces so I always if I see they're like
25 cents I'll buy like literally like 10
or 15 just buy a ton and I don't have to
buy them again for months and months and
months and I always have a pad of paper
with me because you never know when you
need to write stuff down I've got notes
for babysitting and all kinds of stuff
so uh they sell these like packs of a
few at dollar store cash you can get
them anywhere I always like having a
paper with me though I also have my iPad
which you've seen let me know if you
want to see like a what's on my iPad
video I've never even watched as I would
see them but I've had some people
requested so if you're actually curious
let me know because I don't I don't know
I've never even watched them so I guess
I should watch one of those videos and
decide how I if I like it or not but
okay so I also have my contacts case
it's just a little one my boyfriend
actually bought for me and it's quite
convenient to have with you I also have
my sunglasses case which I got this for
like five bucks at Marshall's or TJ Maxx
it's perfect cuz it's really big so even
if you have really rockin humongous
sunglasses they'll still fit in here and
I think these were if I remember right
they were Oscar de la Renta but I got a
good deal on Emma t.j.maxx I am sure
perfect and I love that because then
you're not buying a million pairs of
sunglasses all the time you've always
got a good pair that are
our case so they're not getting all
scratched up and beat up in your purse I
also always have why usually have more
snacks than this in my first because
half of the time I don't have enough
time to pack a lunch lunch so I'm just
throwing banana apple granola bar you I
mean just whatever I can just throw in
my purse this is the nature is clearly
it's all crumbs now of course Nature
Valley apple crisp
I love these but they're crumbs all over
the place but these are so good with
coffee if you drink your coffee
especially if you drink it black and
then there's like the little bit of
sweetness in this it's so good together
even if you don't turn to black but I
love the Nature Valley bars I also have
my regular glasses case I ordered this
online a long time ago and it's mostly a
hard case but I just thought it was cute
and really simple so I got my glasses in
there and if you saw my vlog you saw me
for the first time with my glasses I
never wear them
I really just don't really ever wear
them this is where I keep my feminine
products and what I love about this it
was like three dollars at Walmart near
the you know feminine products and
they're so perfect and you can hold
quite a bit in here and I just think
it's cute and what a cute way to store
these things you know you don't want to
just out and about just through out your
purse then if you drop your purse and
they fly out it's so embarrassing it is
for me anyway so I was really excited
about that find again I like I told you
I always keep paper with me but this is
since I'm in school right now my last
semester I keep my assignments in here
so for each day I just put the date at
the top and then what's due that day
next page is the next day what is due
that day that way I can just look and
see okay
on Tuesday these four assignments are
due you know it's real small and simple
and pretty sturdy I got a good deal on
these at Meijer but I really like things
like this for as an agenda ah
let's see I've got my wallet this is a
Vince Camuto Camuto wallet which I love
and I think I showed it in my packing
video maybe it's quite honestly a mess
I've got just receipts from Christmas
and just all kinds of random things I
was out of town recently receipts from
that just I need to clean this out but I
really do love it I love that I can just
grab it and take it and put my phone in
it
then I'm good to go if I don't want to
carry on my big purse I at least have
those essentials so that is really
really nice about the size and I got
this at t.j.maxx I also have oh my
I always have my phone charger with me
because you never know when you need to
charge your phone it's just nice to have
it in case you need it
then the last thing in my purse is this
bag is which is where I carry pretty
much all of my other things I like
having things more in bags rather than
all separate or in a bunch of little
bags just because it's nice to know that
everything is kind of more contained in
there at least it is for me mentally so
this is an Isaac Mizrahi bag that I got
again at TJ Maxx for I think $5.99
really really inexpensive it is super
cute you can wipe it clean it's got cute
gold hardware with pink little ins on it
I just I love this bag and it it's
really slender I have actually a lot in
here but it really keeps it pretty small
if you're able to find this online send
me the link because I am curious because
I've had a lot of people ask me I'll
have to look to but a lot of people have
been asking and I haven't taken the time
to look yet but this is just so cute I
love this bag so it just magnetized snap
there and then it's two separate parts
which I love I've got all my kind of
beauty to go essentials and I can't wait
to show you guys because I I love it I
love everything in here the first really
really important thing to me is to have
perfume with me because if I've gone to
the gym if I've gone you know if you've
just been outside for a while you know
sometimes you have that like outside
smell anything where you just want to
feel fresh I use this flow atomizer they
also have travel O's another brand you
can get all kinds of different brands of
little perfume atomizers and it's so
easy because on one side you unscrew it
and you literally it's all squishy and
there's instructions you spray your
perfume into it for about a minute if
that and then you screw it shut and then
it's in here and you can tell like where
the level of the it is this right now
actually uh-huh
it's misty or which I love um I just eat
it though but it's perfect it sprays
right the right amount perfect for
travel that way you don't have to carry
around glass bottles you don't have to
worry about
finding a role on version of it you can
just get this you can switch it out and
I loved it it was like 10 bucks and I
bought a black version for my boyfriend
that's another good gift ladies for your
significant other I think that's a great
one
okay I also have my vanilla bean Noel
lotion which I also want to use I'm
about to get a lot of smells going on
here
I don't care uh it's just this is my
favorite scent if you don't know but
it's their nourishing hand cream and my
friend Amy gave it to me and I
absolutely love it and I love that it's
just the perfect little travel size for
this I also have some lip products in
this side I have my mentha lip shine
it's the seal Bigelow my sister got me
for Christmas that I love it's great in
a pinch too if you have bad breath and
you don't have gum or mints or anything
or you can't brush your teeth because it
kind of gives the illusion that your
breath smells good because it's so minty
and you can even lick it and get some
like in your mouth to get you know it's
really not good for you but you could I
have so there's that I also have my
everyday favorite my revlon colorburst
lacquer balm in what was it demure it's
just a really really simple really easy
lip product just it's the perfect color
for my skin tone that I don't even need
a mirror I could just slop it on and
then I also have MAC lipstick in angel
which again in every day color I like to
keep just normal this one's more pink
though then that is a little more orange
E and this one's a little more pink the
Mac one so I've met angel with me all
times at least right now because it's so
easy
let me put all those back in there and
then on the other side we've got umm
Palladio rice paper this is my favorite
thing I end up using this every single
day because inevitably I get oily or I'm
just about to go somewhere else and I
need to look semi decent and I know
maybe my pictures going to take you know
anything this will mattify you like that
it apply it soaks up the oil and gives
you a little bit of powder some of the
rice powder and it's just perfect and
this is so inexpensive you can find it
at Ulta
I think sells Palladio and then also
Pilate is website I think it's like
Pilate Oh beauty calm or something
similar I love this stuff I love it I
love it and I loved
there's powder infused into it so that
way it it does both it is I can't I
can't speak highly enough about this
stuff another thing I have a mirror and
I actually just recently got this at the
semi-annual sale at Victoria's Secret it
was on clearance for like a dollar - woo
blimey
but it's just cute I just think it's
cute
I really that's really the main reason I
bought it but I actually do need a
mirror on hand it's nice to have I also
have eyedrops and this is something I
never leave home without eyedrops these
are just marine brand I don't even know
if it's like miniature it's a real brand
but I get this at the Dollar Tree and I
have very dry eyes first of all and I
remember the first time I ever went to
the eye doctor as an adult the my eye
doctor have said have you been crying
like no he's like oh well your I don't
know the technical terms but you're tier
level is really low like oh so I came
back like a week or two later to get
like to check on the contacts see how
they were wearing and he checked again
he said yeah they're really long he said
I guess you just have really really dry
eyes it's basically was telling me like
well that's good to know
explains why my eyes get really red
pretty easily um but this stuff is
perfect it's gentle it's not like really
drying so I don't I know it's probably
not the best thing to use drops like
this when you have contacts in but I do
and my contacts have been fine but I'm
sure they probably last a little longer
if I didn't so I probably should find
some eyedrops that are good for contact
lenses that say safe for contact lenses
I should probably look into that anyway
but so far I've been okay and they work
pretty well I also have hand sanitizer
this is the winter cranberry scent from
about the body works that a friend gave
me and it just smells like heaven it
literally smells like heaven and I just
have to have hand sanitizer on me at all
times I go through this stuff so quickly
it's kind of unreal but I work with kids
so what can you do i also have a really
beat-up nail file I probably should
replace it with one of my other ones but
I really like to get the kind that have
two different texture gradients just
because it's nice kind of for smoothing
or for shaping but I always have one on
hand because you never know speaking of
my nails or nakey right now you never
know when you need to fix them ah by the
way
it like itch burns I burnt my cheek with
my curling wand today I'm so dumb I had
like a bit of hair right here that was
kind of like curled weird so I was just
taking it and just kind of putting the
curling wand along it you know what I
mean and it touched my skin cool it
hurts them and I haven't covered it or
anything because it happened after I
donated on my makeup so maybe it won't
show up or maybe the makeup I'm wearing
is just gonna cover it I don't know I
have a pen and a pencil but of course
you never know when you're going to need
them and then one of my favorite tricks
is glitter nail polish here is why I
carry it around with me I carried around
with me because when you've got your
nails painted and you get a chip that's
really really noticeable maybe it's a
dark color and it's just so noticeable
and you're about to go out that night
and you don't have time or you're not
even going to be able to go home before
you go out that night maybe it's a
really important business dinner maybe
it's just a really important date or who
knows what it is but you don't want that
big chip and you're like ah and you
don't want to continually have to switch
out having the Polish that you're
wearing in your purse at all times which
sometimes I do that but no time for all
that I switch to my new class all the
time so this is just the one I happen to
be carrying but I always have some sort
of glitter this is the Sally Hansen
complete salon manicure and golden rule
and it is just the prettiest oh it's my
favorite glitter polish but what you can
do is just put glitter polish over that
nail and then if you want it could just
be like an accent nail and it's usually
not that noticeable once you've done
that the chip is hardly noticeable and
then if you wanted say it was this one
you could just do the same thing to the
other one and then you just have an
accent nail even though you didn't
originally you know what I mean you can
just do that as much as you need and
then or you could just do your whole
nails like that and then they all match
even though really some have chips in
them and nobody knows one of my favorite
tricks so I figured I would share that
with you guys so I think that is
everything that is in my purse and I
hope that was helpful maybe you learned
some helpful tips please let me know
below what some of your favorite little
tips of things you like to keep in your
purse for you for a quick fix because
I'm always I love things like this and I
love videos like this so please let me
know your best tips below and I'll catch
you guys very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
