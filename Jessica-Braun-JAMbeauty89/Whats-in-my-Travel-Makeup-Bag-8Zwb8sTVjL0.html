got my what's in my travel makeup bag
video and in this I'm gonna dive right
into my makeup bag that I'm bringing
with me on vacation to show you all of
the products I'm bringing these are all
products that I love these are the these
are great videos to watch because you
get to see what people actually love and
trust enough to bring with them on a
vacation you know like if you're
bringing one eyeliner you're probably
gonna pick an eyeliner that you love and
that you know is gonna work really well
so these are great ways to find out what
people are loving and what people are
genuinely using so hopefully this will
be helpful and fun for you to watch and
I know it was fun filming it and I know
it was fun packing for it because I love
makeup anyway I'll see you guys in just
a second this is a Victoria Secret
makeup bag I just recently got probably
a couple months ago I love it because
you can wipe it clean cute polka dots on
the inside and it's just a nice kind of
big bag for a makeup bag so I can fit a
lot in it there's a few things that
aren't in it yet cuz really I literally
can't shut it which I know is ridiculous
but I love makeup and I like having
options even when I travel and I have
the space for it with the way that I
travelled so some of these are gonna go
probably in my carry-on which means
they'll be in a separate clear bag
anyway so these things for my face I
brought this Revlon Colorstay it's one
of my favorites I know the packaging is
a little messed up but it has a little
bit of SPF in it and I just love it so
that's gonna be like for the evening
times when I'm going out and I want to
look more put together but on the
daytime is the beach vacation unless I
might just be wearing sunscreen but if I
want a little bit I'm gonna use this BB
cream it has an SPF of 30 it's not my
favorite but it's okay and I thought
this would be a great time to use it get
some use out of it I also brought this
elf foundation I have it in the shade
porcelain and I really it's their elf
mineral foundation it does have a little
bit of SPF in it 15 but I like it just
because even if I do just wear sunscreen
I can brush this all over my face and it
just really gives a really nice look to
my face it really evens out your skin
tone which for me blows my mind that a
powder could do that but it really does
I love this
for my undereye I brought a benefit
array space one of my favorites and I
love it it's a melon colored concealer
so it's it really works well to conceal
under eye circles and I have a feeling I
won't be getting as much sleep as I
would like to just because we might be
up late and then getting up early to get
to the beach so this will be great to
kind of help with that obviously I
wouldn't be wearing something like this
to the beach but like when we go out at
night to set my under eye I'm bringing
my ELF HD setting powder
I actually depotted the white the white
stuff that was in here it's translucent
but I had glitter in it it was so weird
so i depotted it and put in my yellow
elf HD powder in here and i love it for
that I'm also bringing my Anastasia brow
powder duo and medium brown I use this
absolutely every day for my brows oh my
gosh like every day I use both colours
there I would lose my mind without it I
think I don't know what I did without
that stuff before ok so this is gonna be
kind of in a random order
I brought my very very favorite
highlight the Wet n Wild color icon
bronzer in reserve your cabana it's
really light but I like it because it's
not shimmery it's just a lighter colored
powder I think if you're any fairer than
me it wouldn't work and I but I think
other than that it should look good on
most people a lot of people will just
use it as an all-over powder but it does
have a little bit of shimmer to it okay
to set any oil slicks I've got on my
face I'm bringing my Rimmel stay matte
of course I will be you know sweating
while I'm there so this will be kind of
really nice to help with that brought a
couple blush options I brought one cream
blush it's the NYX cream blush in boho
chic these cream blushes are amazing
from NYX I and frankly I've only tried
one but I'm so in love with it's a very
wet blush but it's just gorgeous I don't
really know how to describe it it looks
so dewy on the skin and I think you know
the last thing I want to do is look
cakey while I'm an in Beach location so
this is just so nice I think it's gonna
look really really pretty especially if
I get a little bit of color which I'm
sure I will
another blush I brought is my hot mama
this is of course a powder blush and
it's from the balm and it's just such a
cool color I think it's so so pretty
and let's see if I can get a swatch of
that look at that it's such a cool like
Wow look at that
I think I saw out a little bit of the
cream blush oh no on it anyway it's so
so pretty it looks like a really pretty
coral orange color with a lot of gold
shimmer in it for bronzer I'm just
bringing my hoola bronzer I was gonna
bring my cabana glama one that I have it
has the hoola bronzer in it but I wasn't
sure that I wanted to bring that I
shadow trio with me for this because I
think it might be a little bit too
shimmery for a tropical destination if
you will so I didn't want to bring that
whole box just for this so I just
decided to bring my hoola bronzer but I
just love it I love it love it love it
okay I shadow I'm bringing this quad I
put together I actually used to have it
I've switched it back and forth a
million times but for travel it makes
sense to put it in a quad in here I have
this is elf wheat no this is elf single
eyeshadow in taupe this is Mac rice
paper this is Mac sable and then this is
an elf color and of course I cannot
remember I want to say it's called like
sage or something it's a greenish color
I love all four of these colors they
create kind of my everyday I look that I
love but I also been bringing along with
me my naked 2 that way in the evening if
I wanted to add some dramatic something
something I have a lot of options here I
was torn between this one and my naked
one but I went with this one because I
really haven't gotten to uses as much
and there's a lot of colors I love like
this T's color I love for a crease and
half-baked I love but it's in both of
the naked palettes but I figured there's
a lot of options with this with what I
could do so I definitely wanted to bring
that and it's got a nice big mirror on
it too okay so I'm also bringing four
highlight another highlighter my
mary-lou manizer this one's more for the
evening time my wet and wild wand would
be like if I were going out during the
day shopping I'd probably use this but
in the night time if we were going out
I'd probably use this this is a lot more
kind of in-your-face of a highlight
really absolutely look at that it's
stunning but it's certainly more obvious
so this would be more of a nighttime
thing but I love it okay let's see what
else is in here
so for mascara I'm bringing two
different mascaras I'm bringing this
Palladio one that is absolutely my new
favorite
called curls rule it is amazing it keeps
your lashes curled volumize so deep
black it's amazing I was astounded by
the quality of this mascara and it
really is my favorite enough so that I'm
gonna bring it with me on vacation that
should tell you everything really I also
needed a waterproof so I went and picked
this up this is the voluminous million
lashes by L'Oreal so far it's okay I've
used it a couple times just get used to
it the cap is weird it won't shut all
the way so that kind of drives me nuts
I'm a little weird about things like
that but it's okay and it definitely
holds the curl all day I'm not used to
wearing waterproof mascara but I got it
because I figure I'll be sweating a lot
of just be nice to have this as an
option so I'll have to get a more
thorough review it review of it after I
use it some more this next week so I
also am bringing my ELF zit zapper
I just always bring it you know you
never know when you're gonna break out
and this is a really eat travel friendly
little rollerball thing they sell for a
dollar another concealer I'm bringing
other than my array space is my Rimmel
match perfection this I use more as like
a highlighting concealer so it's really
nice to have that as an option and I
just love this stuff
honestly I just love it I couldn't go on
the trip without bringing it for my
brows along with my Anastasia brow
powder I showed you I'm bringing the
anastacio clear brow gel it's great it
holds your lashes in place all day I
mean what else can you say about it's
great it came in a kit so that's really
the main reason I have it for liner I'm
bringing a couple things I'm bringing my
L'Oreal 24 hour lacquer liner and
blackest black it's kind of my absolute
favorite I'm bringing a liquid liner
it's the Physicians Formula eye booster
in case I want to do any you know very
detailed look with that and then I'm
also bringing let's see here the essence
long-lasting eye pencil and bling bling
it's just kind of a gold golden a bronze
when I use on my lower lash line a lot
loops and then I'm also bringing oh my
ELF makeup remover pen for obvious
reasons and then the Jordana 12 are made
to last eyeliner pencil it's in black
points which is their plain black I'm
also gonna have to bring a sharpener
with us unfortunately I wish it were
mechanical but it's such an amazing
liner and it stays all day I love it
okay I'm also bringing my one of my new
absolute favorites the covergirl flamed
out pencil and I don't know what the
color is it drives me nuts but it's so
pretty it's this kind of this um shell
color this pearly color I love it I use
it on my lower lash line all the time
right now okay
Oh for eyelid primer whoa I would die
without something like that my ELF dye I
would not die let's be serious
the elf eyelid primer I love this stuff
I was torn between this and my wet n
Wild Fergie when I decided on this one
because I've used it for longer and I
know how it works and I know it works
well so that's why I'm ringing it and
then for lips I have a few options this
I'm gonna put in my beach bag it's my
baby lips peach kiss has an SPF of 20 I
think at least a dip and I bought it I
know they've taken an SPF out of a lot
of theirs now but this one still does
and I love it and it kind of gives a
really kind of cool peach look to your
lips I really like that then I'm
bringing a bomb stain I'm the reason
we're going there is actually for a
destination wedding so I figure I'll
wear this to the wedding it's just the
Revlon just bitten kissable mom's saying
it's in the shade honey which I love and
I know I'll put it on in the morning
it'll be there all day I'm also bringing
one lip gloss it's just the mac lipglass
and fresh air apparently it's been
sitting on its side for a while but I
love his lip gloss did I say lip glass
lip gloss I guess it is a lip glass wow
I'm singing a lot okay and then I'm also
bringing a maybelline color whisper and
what was the shade of this strike a rose
it's such a pretty color and I haven't
got enough use out of all of these and
I'm bringing one more color whisper in
the shade boop-boop-boop coral ambition
so these two I'm just so excited to give
more of a try I'll be sure to umm let's
see
no I'm one-handed I'm not gonna be able
to you guys for you right now it's gonna
be too hard but I'll be sure to post
pics of maybe me wearing these soon but
I absolutely adore these and the formula
it's just amazing and for a place where
you're gonna be hot you know I don't
really want to worry about lipsticks so
if you notice these are the lip products
I'm bringing I'm really not bringing any
lipsticks this will be in my beach bag
this is a balm stain lip gloss and then
two of the color whispers so yeah that
is what I'm bringing so far of course
knowing me I'll probably think of one
more thing that I need to throw in here
but
this is it for now I hope you enjoyed
this and I will catch you guys very very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
