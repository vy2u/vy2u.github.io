gonna share with you my Sephora libs
these are our products on my support
loves list frankly I'm not gonna mention
everything on there because there's way
too much but I figured I'd kind of pick
the ones that I'm the most excited about
that I like genuinely could see myself
buying and there might be a few on here
that I've got that I might mention that
I'm like I don't know if I'll ever
actually buy it but I like having it in
there and pretending so let's go ahead
and get into it shall we
so the first thing I'm dying to freakin
try is the laura mercier flawless fusion
foundation I've seen so many people
absolutely rave about this and it always
looks amazing on their skin and so I'm
like I want to try that so that one is
really high up on my list as like might
be the next foundation I buy because I
just want to know what it's all about
I'm thinking my shade might be one in
one let me know if you're if you know
that my shade usually matches yours and
you own this what shade are you let me
know that would actually be incredibly
helpful and on that same vein oh this so
that's $48 that's expensive
and then the other one in the same line
the new Laura Mercier flawless fusion
ultra long wear concealer this is $28
and I know it's really really new I'm
looking at the shade one in which is
fair with neutral undertones
I I'm just figuring maybe if I get the
foundation I should get the concealer
and try them together see do they work
really well together I mean the reality
is there's no real reason I need or want
that concealer I just want to try it if
I'm trying also the foundation but also
on my list is the UH Nastasia Emery Z
highlighter I can't decide this is $28
by the way I can't decide is it going to
be too dark for my skin tone it looks
like it's supposed to be more of like a
universal kind of a shade they described
it as light brilliant gold but I always
worry that like even still sometimes
those kinds of colors can be really
obvious on my skin and not in a good way
not in a highlighting way and so that's
one that again if you've tried it in
your new my skin tone please let me know
before I buy it is it gonna work with my
skin tone or not cuz it looks so pretty
in the swatches and people wear again
I'm like oh my gosh it's soap
has anyone heard of this brand Sun and
park I added a couple things to my cart
for literally no reason other than I'd
never heard of the brand and I was
intrigued so the two items I added where
their beauty water and their beauty
filter cream glow so I think once a
moisturizer in one's maybe like a is it
an essence I assume they're expensive
they're so like 30 something dollars but
ah so the beauty beauty water it says
this multi-use product can be used as a
toner and gentle exfoliant in the
morning to prep for skin care but it can
also be used as a cleansing water see
that's pretty cool you can kind of use
it both ways and then the beauty filter
cream glow says it's a lightweight quick
absorbing cream provides coverage
brightens the skin tone a prime skin for
makeup so it'd be probably ideal in the
morning before you're putting on your
skin before you putting on your skin oh
Jessica that is a weird visual but it's
kind of true like if you put on a lot of
makeup it's kind of like you are putting
on your skin oh this is one that's
really high mileage too from Sephora in
the Sephora collection it's their
cleansing oil and balms so I think it's
a makeup cleansing balm which is what I
love but I I think it's knew that
Sephora is selling their own I might be
wrong regardless it's 18 bucks which
really compared to the might some of my
favorites that's not that bad it's 3
ounces so I'm thinking I might try that
one of my love's is something I would
repurchase the way I do my hair
naturally like curly wavy whatever you
call it is the living proof curl
enhancing styling mousse it's $28 but it
does take me a while to go through it
and it's absolutely worth every penny
because it holds my curls together and
it gives them volume so it's worth it
but that one's in my loves cuz I'm
probably like half way through the one I
have now but eventually the IOB oh oh
the next item in my love's is from
bareMinerals it's their new concealer
it's the bear Pro 16-hour full coverage
concealer now this is a stick but oh I
didn't even add the right shade let me
let me look at this here it says it's
got a matte finish it's full coverage
crease proof waterproof we'll see about
that
I could believe waterproof crease proof
with these creases I don't know
the only guy you own anything that's
crease proof it sounds like it's got
some good skincare in it and that's
pretty cool so it says it's got bamboo
stem extract to smooth the look of pores
and fine lines
antioxidant-rich Braz berry seed oil
black currant seed oil sea lavender they
nourish hydrate and help defend skin
against environmental pollutants which
again I really like so I'm intrigued I
don't own a lot of stick concealers I
just don't but even the idea of you know
I'm used to thinking of concealers my
under eye but like I do have blemishes
that it'd be nice and not have to only
depend on my foundation to cover it be
nice to kind of cover those areas first
so I'm thinking about it I'm sure I
don't know I think I'd probably be fair
light warm Oh - if I'm gonna try to use
it on my face you know what I mean to
kind of match my skin tone a little bit
better oh my gosh something I'm really
dying to try the the Henriksen banana
bright eye cream it's $38 like for an
eye cream but yeah I bought I creams at
that price before and the idea of this
kind of brightening your under-eye like
yes I will say it sounds similar to this
product that I am moving its from origin
sense from their ginseng line but it's
they're refreshing eye cream to brighten
and deep Hough
I use this every morning I love it so
it's like my favorite part about getting
ready in the morning is I get a little
bit of this stuff and I just tap it in
and it's it just kind of brightens just
a little bit it moisturizes oh I really
really like this so I probably wait to
buy that until I'm out of this because I
feel like they'll be similar and they're
probably around the same price point -
maybe the origins one is cheaper maybe
another item on my wish list is the
Cogan dough I think Oh Gendo maybe
that's how it's pronounced aqua
foundation this is like one of those
foundations that you'll read like lists
of like makeup artists favorite
foundation and this is on so many makeup
artists favorite foundation list
it's $66 oh that's a lot of money that
is a lot of money however if it is
absolute
mind blowing it might be worth it if you
can afford you know what I mean so I'm
intrigued to try it I really am and it's
been in here forever now it's currently
out of stock at least on sephora's
website as is that banana bright eye
cream I'm now seeing but they're gonna
stay in there and I might eventually try
them another skin care item I just want
to try but again price tag it's the SK 2
it's their essence and so I added this
Patera welcome kit it's a hundred and
ten dollars but it has three different
products in it and I think one of them
is their toner but the toner alone is
super expensive yeah so the facial
treatment essence it's like a celebrity
favorite skincare item it's crazy
expensive but again it might be worth it
I've heard only amazing things about it
that's like me so that's I'm just
yawning sorry so that's one of those
items that it might live in my loves for
quite a while maybe eventually I'll buy
it
but I I mean that's something that if I
ever am I'm gonna wait till a vib sale
so I can get it at least 20% off or
something like that cuz that's a lot of
money so those are all of the loves that
I'm gonna share today like I said I've
got a lot more but some of them are ones
that they're not really that exciting or
they're ones that I just put in there
because I I want them saved so when I
want to repurchase them they're easy to
find not that I couldn't just type in it
anyway it doesn't matter so if you
enjoyed this kind of a video definitely
give it a thumbs up let me know
I actually just today filmed kind of the
kind of counterpart well not really but
it's a bunch of luxury items that I
hated so if that video is up I will link
it if it's not stay tuned because I
filmed it in the same math shirt but I
figure it will kind of balance it out
this is more positive like exciting new
products to buy and then that one is
more like stay far away these products
are terrible
so we'll just we'll just keep it
balanced here on my channel so I hope
you enjoyed I hope you'll subscribe
before you leave and hit that little
notification bell so it lets you know
when I upload new videos and I'll see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
