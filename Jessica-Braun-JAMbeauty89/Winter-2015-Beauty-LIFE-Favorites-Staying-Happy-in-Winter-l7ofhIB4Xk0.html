bringing you my winter favorites and as
I look outside it's just so cold and
grey and and i feel like i know i am and
i wonder if some of you guys are just
kind of going through the winter Grey's
I don't want to call them blues because
it's not genuine sadness but it's just
the blahs the greys just the and so I
started thinking about the things that
make me really happy in the wintertime
the things that just make me feel cozy
or just I don't know just a little bit
happier so I wanted to share them with
you because I'd realize like you know I
really do have products that i love
using in the winter and I some of them I
think might be fun to share with you
guys so if you're interested just keep
on watching the first thing I'm going to
talk about our some makeup items because
I figure that's what most of you guys
would be interested in and then I've got
some other lifestyle items towards the
end so I'll save this for the end first
things first there's a foundation that I
used to love that they rereleased and it
is the most beautiful like moisturizing
satin finish foundation and it looks so
amazing in the winter time in the summer
I think I get a little too oily with it
but in the winter it makes my skin look
alive and it is the Rimmel lasting
finish foundation says it lasts 25 hours
I don't know about all that I am in the
shade 101 classic ivory it's a little
deeper than my skin tone but not so much
that it looks noticeable so I don't mind
it and I'm pretty sure this is the
lightest they had at least the place I
went but it has SPF 20 and it's just
comfortable and it makes your skin look
just SAT me and beautiful it doesn't
highlight dry patches like in the winter
my skin is a freaking mess dryness wise
and this just makes it look so nice and
I so they used to be in like a squeezee
tube I'm assuming it's the same formula
it feels like it smells like it so I
think it is but I just love this so much
and if you're looking for kind of a full
coverage fountain foundation but it
doesn't dry your skin out you would love
this but if you do have oily skin year
round I would stay away you probably
wouldn't like it another makeup product
that I love it's quickly
climbed the ranks of my lip liners and
it's my favorite one to wear right now
in the winter and it's this Milani color
statement lip liner I love the shade
spice and I actually recently got this
but I can't stop using it because it's
this perfect kind of almost brown color
but it looks gorgeous under any of these
really in style marsala colors of those
you know kind of rosy neutral colors it
just makes them look even deeper and
even more beautiful and it keeps them
inside the lines and this is so
inexpensive I just love it and I didn't
think I would because my skin is so fair
that I think colors like this don't look
great on me but this one I love the next
one is one that I I can't stop wearing
because it makes my skin again there's
kind of a theme I like my skin to look
more alive because everything's so gray
in the wintertime and it's this wet wild
by fergie around-the-clock blush and the
shade is brush with destiny and I'd
mentioned this in a recent huge
drugstore haul and it's just the
prettiest shimmery peach color and it
just makes you look so alive and like
just juicy in a way I know I use that
word in the weirdness of ways but it
just makes your skin look juicy and I
love that for that and it's like 399 and
I again can't stop wearing it during
this gray weather look at the mug that
my student got me I don't remember if I
show this in a video yet or not but I
had a matching like warmer for it that
has Mickey on it so cute and actually
the tea that I'm drinking I'm going to
mention in a second okay so the next
makeup item is a lipstick and this got
lost in my collection for a long time
and it is the Rimmel lipstick and airy
fairy and this was one that everyone
used to talk about years ago like crazy
and it's just the most perfect brownish
pink neutral color but it's actually
like wearable I feel like some colors
like this either look way too Brown or
they look way too light this is just
right in between and it's so beautiful
so inexpensive and this might be my
favorite winter time lip call
just because you still look nice you
don't look super vampy but you also
don't look like you don't care you know
it's just it's just beautiful it's so
perfect if you've been looking for just
a really simple lip color to wear every
single day I would recommend this just
because it is so inexpensive and it's
beautiful okay this one I haven't talked
about these in a while the Beauty
Blender this makes your skin especially
when you're applying it i love this
foundation with it but what I've noticed
is no matter what foundation I'm using
what I'm using a brush it just it works
great in the summertime but in the
winter I don't love using a brush all
the time because I feel like it's just
dragging the foundation across any dry
patches I have and that drives me nuts
so this is so amazing because you do wet
it and it kind of just almost puts
moisture into the skin that's pressing
the foundation in which is really what
we should do anyway but in it just for
me I feel like if my skin's extra drive
that day and I use this my skin looks so
much better than if I were to have used
a brush so and they've got a lot of you
know you can find these on sale and I
always have coupons linked below like
first 24 and places like that you can
usually get two packs for cheaper than
you would want and things like that and
if you take care of them might have
lasted a very very long time one of the
other things that I do a lot in the
winter time is like if i'm bored and I
you know usually when I'm at home I mean
they're catching up like fun to Tyler we
don't live together but if I'm with him
we're usually you know watching a movie
or playing a board game or you know
something nerdy like that but if I'm
alone I don't have videos to editor I'm
not commenting I keep catching myself
signing on to the site where you do the
surveys and you get paid for them and I
am like addicted to it it's kind of
gross its opinion outpost and I
mentioned it before and back then when I
mentioned it like I liked it and I used
it from time to time and I made a little
bit of money from it but like in the
winter I'm not going outside other than
work so once i'm home like I catch
myself signing on to their just like
randomly and taking a few surveys and
make it some money and moving on like
and it's so amazing because if you
really devote a little bit of time to
whatever
while you make a lot of money so if you
haven't checked it out yet I'll put the
link below it's awesome and I I just
can't stop and it's perfect because if
I'm like if i'm like wanting to buy
something for myself like as a treat
like i just uploaded that my like luxury
loves video and you know I was treating
myself to some really expensive things i
would recommend is use the money you
make from something like the survey like
Opinion Outpost you could make some
money there and put all of that towards
the new palette that you're dying
together the new lipstick whatever and
then you don't feel quite as guilty
because you're not taking away from your
original pool of money like your income
but it's like a side income that you can
use for those things that you love that
you wouldn't normally buy for yourself
so the next favorite is this andalu
naturals fruit stem cell revitalize
serum this is a serum that's different
than the other serums I've used and
other students I've used or more like
kind of oily you know and you just get
them all over your face you let us think
and then you put a moisturizer on this
one is lotion II um but I still use it
as a serum because that's what it's
marketed as and it just makes my skin
feel tight but it not in a noticeable
way but let me rephrase it doesn't make
it just makes my skin look so nice and I
always put a moisturizer on after it
once it suck in it this this smells
amazing I just love this and I love that
it's got a little pump you can get it on
vitacost for pretty cheap and it's
certainly cheaper on there than it is on
any other site but I love this stuff
like really really really love it I've
been using it for a while and it's just
to like here still so that is not bad oh
my gosh this stuff is amazing and it
smells unbelievable another favorite is
this l'occitane um he just hand cream
it's just our original this is the
second one I've had of this I used that
one a little bigger this is a deluxe I
got like a gift with purchase recently
and I was so excited because this is one
of my favorites because you know your
hands and cuticles get so dry and this
does such an amazing it's a very thick
cream but but not too thick and I think
that's what I like about some buttery
type ones are almost hard to work with
but this is still creamy enough but it's
so so moisturizing and it stays on all
day but it doesn't feel greasy
and it looks like butt paste you know
the tubes that the butt paste comes in
looks like that so that's great okay a
few other favorites that are just more
like lifestyle and fun my little
slippers these I got at target and it
was one of those things that I was like
I don't need those like I have slippers
but all my slippers are like clunky
bigger ones and these were more like
really thick socks it was a target of
his walmart and there's a few months ago
and I I mean they were like four or five
dollars but I again wanted to treat
myself I'm like but I want them I want
them for the winter time to be able to
walk around without clunky slippers and
they're so cute and you can just throw
them in the washer and they're clean you
know the UM but they don't like damage
them at all they're just so nice I love
them so so much and I might actually my
toes are cold right now oh oh and I just
hit my shin and you know that's gonna
bruise oh come on so what I'm drinking
right now is so so good my future
brother-in-law Tyler's brother he got me
for my birthday the most amazing gift I
have never owned teavana tease and week
titled I always go in there and I oh we
always like try all the T's and were
like oh my gosh but it's so expensive
and he got me two different teas and he
I guess that talk to the person there
and they were saying oh my gosh you can
mix them and it's great and he knew that
I liked coconut tea and this is the
zin'za Burge injure coconut rooibos tea
and it is oh my gosh it smells so
amazing it smells like it smells like oh
um not almond amaretto but it's this
coconut and ginger and you know they
come as a loose tea and I just use I'll
try and show you without getting it
everywhere this little you get these for
like two or three dollars at walmart or
anywhere that you can put the loose tea
in and then shut it and then you can
just rinse it out and then it just hooks
onto the side another winter favorite
why not um anyway so I have been mixing
this with the other one he got me which
is Silver Needle white tee and these
aren't true like the Silver Needle
leaves or wealth needles I guess
and this one smells like white tea like
I mean it's more of a not a bland but
more of a straight tea and then this has
all this flavor so when you mix them it
is the most perfect like ratio oh my
gosh and it's so like delicate tasting
but it has that flavor but it's not so
like punch you in the face flavor
because i feel like if i had this alone
and I've never even tried it alone I
mixed them every time it would be almost
too much either way and together it is
the most perfect and it was such an
awesome gift thank you Jason if you're
watching this I doubt you are but if you
are thank you I love them last one
another favorite team because it's
winter and you're drinking hot stuff
because it's cold outside is my tazos NT
I recently did that Hall of all those
teas that i got from vitacost and it was
mostly um yogi tea brand well I've been
working my way through those and trying
a bunch and you know the ones that I had
loved I still love and the ones that I
didn't I'm not a hundred percent loving
because a lot of them are so strong
flavor wise that it's almost too much
and I do like more of a delicate tea
tazos NT is the best it's like a it says
that it's got its green tea which yes
it's green tea but it's got lemongrass
and spearmint and the idea is that you
know you feel like just calm but you
don't it doesn't make you sleepy it's
just like the perfect it's the perfect
tea I don't know how to describe this
you just have to try it it's just so
good and I bring it to school because
Tyler for my birthday got me a like a
one of those things that you just plug
in and flip the thing and it boils the
water in like 40 seconds and then you
have hot water and you can just turn it
off I use that at school and I went
through one of these boxes like that so
I need to buy a few more honestly
because it's my favorite and you can
find it the drugstore it's even cheaper
on vitacost just saying not saying
you're saying so those are all of my
winter time favorites I know winters
almost over and i'm so excited but i
feel like this is the time of year
that's the longest stretch this februari
and march time and for me i'm a teacher
so we're in that stretch of like testing
statewide testing and the kids are
stressed stresses me out as stresses the
parents out these things just
make me happy I just like them let me
know what your winter favorites are
below i'm always interested especially t
wise and hand cream wise just things
that make your skin look not dry i'm
always into so let me know those as well
