haul for you and I know I just hauled
but this is kind of I have no excuse I
really don't that's not you because I
really needed sweaters and I realized I
literally had like a sweater how is that
possible I I mean I don't even know how
I don't have any sweaters but I was
going through and now that I'm student
teaching I need dress clothes every
single day and in the winter I don't
necessarily want to just wear you know
button-up shirts I want sweaters too and
all I have are like cardigans or fleeces
but I'm like I just want sweaters that I
can just throw on and be done I don't
need to layer anything so that was my
aim when I went out shopping keep that
in mind because I bought other things
too of course okay so we'll start with
the sweaters this one I got at Target
isn't this color really cool it's like
it no it's indigo it's not even like
it's the perfect indigo color in person
it's a little lighter on camera I'm
saying but I just really really like it
these earrings I got a long time ago at
Target and I just like them with it that
there's like the indigo color and light
blue in it and I think it's really cute
in that cute anyway so this sweater I
liked because it was really really just
simple plain colored long-sleeve but
it's comfy and it's just got a crewneck
and I don't know I just liked how plain
it was really which I know it sounds so
boring but then I don't feel crazy when
I'm wearing really funky earrings with
it you know so that was one thing I got
at Target and actually I guess I'll show
you my target stuff and this was around
$15 here's the deal this videos gonna be
long the deal is that cartwheel which is
an app from Target it's also a website
you can get it's like 20% off coupons
really or offers that you clip and then
they have to scan it on your phone like
the barcode so like I think I'd like a
20% off cartwheel coupon and then I also
had a target.com coupon that I had to
print out that was like three dollars
off of a you know sweater purchase
something like that so I ended up
getting this like 10 bucks or something
awesome and it's one of their ultra soft
one so I was really excited I also got
this which was on
Clarence it's just this really pretty
emerald green cardigan but it doesn't
button or anything like that it kind of
reminds me of a grandpa's sweater but
it's actually really cute on it's got
these little pockets and it's actually
fitted through the sleeves which I
really liked because a lot of sweaters
are real baggy and for me it's just not
really in my taste but it was a Massimo
Supply Company and I think I got up like
$7 on clearance but it's just an
open-faced little sweater and it is so
comfortable oh my gosh it's so
comfortable it's one of those sweaters
that you just want to like wear and then
like drink hot cocoa or coffee and just
like sit around like you guys know
exactly what I mean and I know you do
like there's just
Kofi's sweaters that you picture
yourself just like curled up like
watching a movie drinking oh yeah
anyway I'm in an awesome mood because
when I'm filming this it's Friday I have
a feeling I won't be uploading it for a
little while because there's like a
million things I've gotta upload but
anyway okay so that was another thing I
also got this it was on clearance for
five dollars and 68 cents this workout
shirt that it's fitted at the top and
then it just as flares out you see what
I mean in that cute and it's just a hot
pink color and it's got like the built
in like shelf bra which actually I don't
mind in workout shirts and everything
else I hate it but I'm workout shirts I
don't mind but I like to think it's like
flowy so that I can wear it with
leggings and even if it's like kind of
tied up there it doesn't really bother
me you guys know what I mean but um I
was excited about that it was originally
you know like 1899 I got it for five
bucks
ha and then this one you guys know I'm a
clearance baby five dollars it's one of
their well worn shirts I don't I mean
it's not by Target it says it's an
original by well-worn Los Angeles but
this was five bucks and it is just this
really pretty red color and I picture
wearing it with my like shorts that I
got also on clearance from Target like a
month ago
they're like American flag shorts that
are kind of like burnt out and stuff
like that they're really really really
cute um and I think this is gonna be
really cute with it it's just gonna be
cute regardless so that's what I got
from Target went to air apostille which
I haven't been in err pasta since high
school which was like six years ago
almost seven years ago
is crazy think about their anyway um got
these pants for I thought they're gonna
be like $8.99 or something like that
which is a crazy deal as it was rang up
$5.99 Aeropostale there this olive green
this deep olive green color they're just
skinny pants and then they have this
really cute zipper on both sides right
there and just normal pockets in the
back which I live and they fit like a
dream
so I went to H&amp;amp;M and got this sweater I
should have bought more sweaters I'll
tell you that cuz I really didn't get as
many as I don't I got other things this
is from H&amp;amp;M and it's just this really
pretty deep maroon like almost a merlot
okay so my camera shut off so here we go
I left off with the maroon sweater that
I was talking about the has like the
glitter detail around the collar from
H&amp;amp;M which is so cute
so they also had a sale on button-up
dress shirts for women that are actually
fitted which made me lose my mind cuz I
can never find those anywhere for a good
price
these actually feel really well made I
mean they're not the most well made
things in the universe but they're they
feel really nice they're 995 version 19
I got a light blue and white pin striped
one a white one and then I also my
favorite one I got is this black and
white pinstripe one I just think it's so
fun it's gonna look so cute with this
pink blazer that I have so I got three
button out dress shirts that are fitted
through the arms fitted here fitted even
like here sometimes dress shirts could
be weird in that area
these fit so well and they were ten
bucks each over 30 bucks I got three and
I'm kind of set for a while because I
don't wear button-downs that much but
they're so cute with Blazers they're so
cute on their own they're really cute
with cardigans like rolled up all I love
it so that is what I got at H&amp;amp;M from Old
Navy I got this might be my most know
the last few purchases are all my
favorite things that I bought um one of
the things I got was for free from Old
Navy it was a $25 shirt that was free
because I used this app called vigil
that's Vig GLD and it's a free app and
basically any time you're watching TV
you can push a button it'll listen to it
and check you into that show and you get
a number of
points for every minute you watch but
really you could just check into the
show and then turn the TV off which is
usually what I do and then you're
getting the points for however long that
show or movie was and then if you check
into movies that are featured you get
bonus points and stuff it's easy to rack
up points so you get I've gotten like
two different $25 gift cards that they
just email to you so one I got for Old
Navy they usually have Sephora on there
too by the way and I got this running
shirt and I needed some long sleeve ones
cuz I run outside as much as possible
and right now it's just too chilly um so
this one I loved because of the color
again it's like this indigo color it's
almost blending in to me I love that
this pop of like purplish pink it fits
beautifully the little thumb holes the
sleeves are really really long and
fitted so there's a little thumb holes
for you to stick your thumb through
while you're running it is so nice I
wore it the other day and it was like
raining but it just felt so good out
anyway um and this just was amazing it
didn't move it didn't rub against my
skin in weird ways it is so nice and
it's only 25 bucks I would have paid
that straight up but I got it for free
because of Diggle Thank You Viggo
so I also went to TJ Maxx and got a new
wallet this one I was actually went
there with the intention of getting into
a wallet because mine there's a hole and
like a lining so like all my changers
getting lost and like the dungeons of my
walk but then I'd had it for quite a
while this is a Jessica Simpson wallet I
love the color kind of like this deep
teal picking up know what's picking up
the color just about right um but I love
the little stud detail and guess what it
was on clearance for seven dollars I got
some steals I was wheeling and dealing
out there ladies um I love the way that
it is set up I love that it's kind of
just an accordion style like that I
haven't had a wallet that's this style
in so long I keep getting the kind that
is like a trifold but long and I've just
gotten tired and this is nice
everything's all-in-one I got my coupons
I got my rewards cards etc so I really
really like this and I just think it's
cute and look at the design here look at
that can you guys see the cute little
design on the inside I love it so
there's that and then I have stuff from
Bath and Body Works
okay so I was losing my mind because the
vanilla bean Noel and I'm not even I'm
speaking in fragments let me start over
the Christmas sensor out of Bath and
Body Works and my favorite scent is
vanilla bean Noel and it's out and I'm
so excited and this is like an honest I
know I look so dorky which I don't
really care but if you haven't smelled
vanilla bean Noel you will lose your
mind when you do if you like vanilla I
was taught the lady that was um the
cashier at found the body was saying I
don't really like smell and I was like
get out now get out of here I was so mad
no I just couldn't believe it because
I'm like what do you mean you don't like
it so it's like the best of all the
universe but everyone is different
anyway so this I got the triple moisture
body cream which I always get that when
it comes to lotion Bath and Body Works I
gotta put some on and what here's what's
so crazy I'll put this on in the morning
and then I go to school and like
throughout the day I'm working with kids
so I wash my hands you know at least a
couple times or any time I use the
restroom I can still smell this on my
hands by the end of the day after you
know at least wash my hands four or five
times it's crazy I don't know what's in
this stuff but it's just so moisturizing
the smell is amazing so I also I don't
ever get that's not true I usually don't
get their body washes but I did end up
getting the vanilla bean Noel body wash
from there just a shower gel really just
because my showers smell amazing when I
have this stuff and I hope it lasts me
forever I might buy another I just want
to use it all the time forever and ever
oh my gosh have you guys know it's not
this stuff you have to I also did get
some other smells because I did the buy
three get three but my boyfriend ended
to pick it out some stuff too we were
kind of mix it a match in there so I
only have a few more items I did have a
coupon for a free travel sized items so
I got the scent be enchanted one of my
favorites and I also got the full-size
of being chanted for one of my free
products this is another one that I
absolutely love very different than
vanilla bean Noel but just so sweet and
like in the
interesting way so I love the enchanted
+ are you kidding me look at that
packaging look I also got an old
favorite moonlight path and this one I
used to love and I haven't bought it in
years and years but what I like about it
is it's such a clean very simple scent
it's very understated but it's one of
those you know it's there and you can
kind of smell it like I'm picturing it
all my hands and me smelling it and I
just really really like it and this is
another one that I think no one really
talks about because it is so understated
but I really kind of liked it for that
and in the spring it's just such a nice
that even in the winter any time but if
for some reason it reminds me of like
winter into spring it's just such a
clean lovely scent so that is that
everything I think I did it that is
everything hopefully this all was fine I
know the lighting is getting cuckoo and
like the cameras like changed planes I
mean it's like this video is a mess but
anywho I hope that was enjoyable to
watch and definitely go check out Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works there's a lot of good sales
going on at H&amp;amp;M like I said at Target

check out the viggo app to get free gift
cards over time and girls I'm trying to
