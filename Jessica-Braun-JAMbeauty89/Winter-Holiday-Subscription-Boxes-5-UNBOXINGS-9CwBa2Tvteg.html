things I've got like a million
subscription boxes to open with you guys
today one two three four five this might
be a record
I'm opening five subscription boxes in
one video I'm so excited they're all
different kinds of subscription boxes so
let's go ahead and get into it so the
first one I'm gonna unbox is choco kirb
I'm actually doing this video with them
today and I've done one with them I
think last month and I love chocolate so
much so I'm always excited I also have a
10% off code if you're interested in
that so I've got two different boxes
this is their Nano box and then I also
have their large box let's start with
the Nano box I'm going started to eat
some chocolate because I'm actually
coming into this really hungry so this
is perfect so it's so cute if you like
chocolates just holiday like anyway just
in its nature so oh my gosh I'm about to
get so much chocolate so there's a bunch
of little things in here the first thing
in here is this dark chocolate by mini
cow and it's their dark chocolate 63%
comb Bava and pink pepper let's try it
I've got this dark lipstick on what was
I thinking cuz I knew I was gonna be
eating chocolate I always had the cutest
little like packaging it's like you slip
it out of there the last time I did this
I was giggling because it was like in
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
where there's like a golden ticket like
delicately in the chocolate
okay let's try a bunch of little squares
hmm umm this says I just realized truly
Madagascar and it's bright and citrusy
and it does have a citrus taste to it
that's so cool I can't say I've ever
tried one like that but I think that's
really paired well with the dark
chocolate because it kind of balances
each other out this next one is by
Chocolat dolphine and it's milk
chocolate with cinnamon yes oh my gosh
hmm that is totally cinnamon and it
totally gets me excited for Christmas
this one is ethereal confections let's
try this one it's got cute blue foil in
it
mmm that one was I think milk chocolate
but it just had a nice tit like depth to
it I don't know how to describe it it's
really good the next thing in here is
the by Cho Mochaccino milk chocolate +
Blue Bottle coffee that's my favorite so
far
mmm there's literally coffee in it it's
so good I need to keep those like it
worked like a whole bunch of these that
you can if you don't like coffee you
wouldn't like it but if you do you will
love that last thing in the Nano box is
this Seattle chocolates cool mint mmm so
the next thing is their large box
I'm so excited Merry Christmas
there's oh my gosh so many cool another
fly away so many goodies I love it it
does feel like Christmas so this has all
a bunch of bull size and some little
ones as well oh my gosh I get so excited
so top things so beautiful this is the
Alma the milk chocolate almond minibar I
love milk chocolate and I love almonds I
love all chocolate this would be an
awesome gift like if you really do know
someone that's got like the most
ridiculous sweet tooth like me this
would be the most amazing gift for them
for the holidays look at these they're
to me there's nothing better than
almonds plus chocolate that was so
incredible I had the best crunch next
thing pitch-dark modern American
chocolate from the Jasmine pearl tea
it's matcha tea and nib last time I got
something with nib in it and it was so
good like little like crunches you know
again these are wrapped so beautifully
they're so gourmet this is something you
could buy one box and just split it up
amongst different stockings so like you
know I was one of six
so my mom could have bought something
like this and then put one of the
full-size one so it's like a little bit
more gourmet than just go to the store
and buying Hershey's or something
there's nothing wrong with Hershey's I
like that too but this is just nice very
special stuff it tastes like matcha tea
that is so cool
there's a little like kind of see like
little matcha tea maybe like little nibs
throughout crunchy good like really deep
taste mmm next thing is packaging it's
from Wasi a paris 1827 Chocolat Olay
let's try it
31% cacao that was perfect milk
chocolate also got this row cocoa
chocolates basil and Persian lime what
so even like the little wrapping is so
cute whoa this flavor is crazy
you can totally taste the basil in the
line but it's still clearly chocolates
like a really cool mix that's really
good and see that's what I like like
feel like it gets me out of my comfort
zone with chocolate I love chocolate I
eat it every single day and that's the
truth so like I really like these
different kinds you're kind of
experiencing different things next thing
is this Forte White Swan Black Swan
espresso and white chocolate whoa Golden
Tickets
so it is totally white look at this oh
my gosh this bar is cool so it's white
chocolate but it's got like parts of it
or like like it's like three-dimensional
well of course it is but you guys
alright I'm so intrigued to try this hmm
if you were a white chocolate lover in a
coffee lover year that is your dream
that's very good
so creamy tall white chocolate is so
creamy but it's got that little kick of
the espresso which again I think
balances it out really nicely next thing
in here is this super dark matcha
green-tea
by those kids I don't think this is the
same brand of the other one so that's
let's try it they must know matcha green
tea is really big right now all right
like this one even better than you know
it's also good though and then this is
the Cho Mochaccino which I have had I'm
not gonna open this one I'll let my
husband try this is the same one that
was in this smaller one how it was so
much chocolate I just love this I think
it's such a fun different subscription
boxes I get so many Beauty once oh I
love doing things like this I hope you
enjoy it too but like I said I'll have
the link for this below and the promo
code and yeah I definitely check it out
it's an awesome gift idea alright so the
next ones we're gonna open our it see
and boxycharm and birch box and buff it
fun
let's start with Ipsy $10 a month I'll
have the info for this below the bag is
pretty cute it says rock starlet is the
theme I presume it's cute it's kind of a
thicker like almost foamy feeling bag
it's got a little star for the zipper
pool let's see what's in it so this is
the do say free matic blush why is it
free okay so it's like a little I think
you're supposed to like have a thing to
hold it looks like it's magnetic so I'm
sure you could put it like in a Z
palette whatever oh it's a really pretty
color actually that was surprising that
would look nice today umm actually very
very buttery very pigmented but it seems
like it blends pretty well so I almost
spoke too soon but I think I will slip
that into a Z palette then awesome so
that's pretty cool next thing is this
Oprah banana highlighting powder and
actually I feel like I've had this
before again you could just put it like
in a zip out this is really I'm not
gonna open it because I really do think
I have this exact one so I'm gonna pass
this on to a sister but um it is a it's
a really good powder I mean I like using
it to set my under eye just because it
is so brightening but I like that it's
not a loose powder because I have tons
of loose powders to do that and I love
them but it is nice to have an option
that's not loose it's easier to travel
with next thing in here is this absolute
New York matte lipstick and it's in the
shade dark red feels like um it is matte
but it feels more moisturizing like it
was really creamy going on so that is
always kind of nice it's a deeper shade
of red but it's pretty so that's pretty
nice I've never heard of that brand next
thing is this the balm
mad lash black mascara um I actually
heard really good things about this I
have too many mascaras open so I don't
want to open it but I have heard really
good things so this might be kind of
moving up in the docket of one of the
next ones I try so awesome and then the
last thing in here yes oh then not your
mother Mother's she's a tease volumizing
hairspray I like this stuff I've tried
it might have been in travel-size before
but it's a pretty nice strong hairspray
like it's not crazy strong where it's
like crispy but it's nice and strong
like it's kind of the right amount for
me and I'm always needing more travel
size hair sprays for my purse or for
travel whatever so I will definitely use
that that is actually very useful to me
so not a bad month I don't think not my
favorite month by any means but not a
bad one you know and that's kind of how
it is just hit or miss with these kinds
of boxes let's try the birch box next
since they're like the same price $10
the box is really cute
it says the finishing touch this month
is all about this extra just because
details that make all the difference do
they've got the prices so the first
thing let's see it's from phyto paris
it's there phyto carotene masks this is
is this the full-size I think it might
be $45 oh hey oh wait maybe this isn't
the full-size it's for hair so maybe
it's not but it's still a decent size so
that is awesome right now I'm loving my
Brio go1 that I actually filmed about
today it's awesome but when that runs
out I'm willing of course to try
something else I like it it's got one of
those like thick like metal foil type
things I don't know why I like products
like that but I do so that is awesome I
will definitely use that the next thing
what this is from or BAE and it's their
super fine hair spray the or BAE any
product from them is so ridiculously
expensive
so I have their texturizing spray and
it's amazing but it is stupid expensive
so this is awesome again a travel size
I'm gonna like baby this little thing
because it's so expensive so that is
freaking sweet cheese this is a good box
this is the keels heels is expensive too
this the full size of this is $37 it's
their midnight recovery eye so it's an
eye treatment it's got minimizes lines
diminishes dark circles reduces
puffiness you say to use it at night
just feels really moisturizing you know
kind of that lotion like texture but
again keels is a brand I really haven't
dabbled in at all so I'm excited to give
this a try and then the last few things
in here there's a mini of the
Porefessional which I actually this is
kind of perfect timing because I'm
really in love with the NYX pore filler
and I want to try that compared to this
and I don't own this right now so I've
heard this is really good I feel like
I've tried it in the past but it's been
so long since I've tried it oh yeah this
is just like the NYX pore filler okay
yeah those are definitely dupes so I'm
working on a dupes video so excited to
have that and then the last thing in
here is this blush and bronzer palette
I'm sorry I am and maybe I'm just being
shallow but it's a paper thing Coastal
Scents like come on if you're trying to
get people to buy your products this is
not going to get me to buy it and I know
I'm not usually this like negative with
stuff like this but I feel like this
keeps happening not just in Birchbox but
in AFC and stuff but like if a company
if you're trying to get I know you're
want to do it cheaply so people can try
the product but like I don't even have
the desire to try this hey I can't get
my brush in there to get the blush or
the highlight out way too small so then
I just don't use it I'm like forget it
and I just pass it on I don't know I
don't know why that bothers me so much
but it does if you're trying to get your
name out there and get people to use
your products then represent your
product well and maybe give I don't know
it just obsessed me is anyone else
anyway so honestly I think with the or
Bay and the phyto thing and the Kiehl's
thing and the Porefessional that was
awesome even just those four items alone
get the other one that is awesome so
that was totally kick tip C's booty this
time around
sorry MC next boxycharm are you guys
still with me so moving on to boxycharm
this one's a little more expensive I
think it's like twenty-one dollars a
month but they usually have all
full-size products that I have not P I
usually kind of peak sometimes I gotta
be honest but I haven't peaked at all so
I'm very excited okay this is this the
packaging is beautiful
it says vintage let me see illuminating
face highlighter full-size $32 so is the
brand vintage then yeah vintage
cosmetics it's in rose gold I can't wait
to try this okay
the packaging is this beautiful white
packaging with vintage written on it oh
this is more like a blush though right I
mean at least on my skin tone it would
be I love the big pan now it does kick
up a lot of powder but like a lot okay
it is more of like a highlighter though
it's kind of in-between this would
almost be a really pretty like blush
topper just because it's not quite a
blush on its own but it's a little dark
for me to be a highlighter but I love
that it's got a big pan a big mirror the
packaging is gorgeous so that is awesome
next thing is a brush from crown and
it's a really like a detail brush it
says crown brush pro detail crease
$12.99 it is just a really small really
good you could probably get under your
lower lash line just get really detailed
I actually need a brush like this so
that's kind of perfect
next thing is from skin Isle Iceland
Icelandic relief eye cream boom with
glacial flower extract
ooh so this one retails for $20 and it
looks oh it's broken
so here's what's supposed to be on there
I have a cannot there we go it just
snapped out and I guess it just snaps
back in so it's not that big of a deal
but still but it's a full size it's like
this rubbery top and I'm
just like an eye thing and I've heard
amazing I tried some skin Iceland wipes
and I loved them like loved them I was
so surprised so I'm excited to give this
a try as well next thing is they lip
cream it's from bella pierre and i one
of my favorite lip glosses from a
million years ago was from bella pierre
and it was called I think vanilla pink
or something like that and I loved it
different packaging I don't know if it
was the same formula or anything either
but I loved that lip gloss so this is
the full size and it is $20 oh okay it's
like a liquid lipstick it's a really
pretty color though ona has a totally
different smell than most liquid
lipsticks smell like vanilla this one
smells kind of like kind of fruity in a
way not too fruity but definitely has
that kind of a scent so it's a really
pretty color the color is antique pink
and the last thing in here oh is this
the one I already have no it's different
yes all right I got one of these before
and I love this palette these retail for
yeah $50 which I don't know that I would
favor but regardless it's an amazing
deal in here because it's an amazing
palette it's the studio makeup on the go
I showed a palette and this one does
this not have the like name of it coz
this is different than the one I already
have this one's more of like rosy and
pink tones is this not an ohm i gosh
this is gorgeous I can't wait to watch
it watch it
beautiful beautiful beautiful oh my gosh
so swatch wise gorgeous let me pull up
my sleeve here so you guys can see
I am so excited so excited so amazing I
love this combo of colors let me pull up
my other one so you can see it yeah I
don't know how they differentiate
between them I don't see Nate like a
name on this but this is the one I
already had so like if you compare them
I love this one too
these are awesome combos of shadows but
looking at the difference yeah this
one's much more warm and this one's much
more cool and kind of rosy so beautiful
though these are two they quickly become
two of my favorite palettes like ever so
that is an awesome deal awesome and so
for 20 bucks you get that and the like
blush highlighter thing and the skin
Iceland thing and the brush and what was
the other other lip gloss for the liquid
lipstick which is trying pretty nicely
there so that was awesome I mean if
there were a winner of the makeup ones
that would win but the thing is that one
always wins because it's double the
price you get like just full-size
products and stuff like that but I still
love to the Birchbox this time so the
last thing is gonna be my fabfitfun I
have a promo code for this I will link
below as well I'm sorry this desk is
covered and stuff this is crazy I have a
promo code I will link below this is
their Welcome box which you know what
when you join this would be the box you
get for this year and so it always has
like a little not a catalog but like a
thing like just a cute little magazine
that talks about some of the stuff in it
just different things I just like that I
always flip through that so let's dive
in the first thing in here are these pop
chips that's kind of fun pop chips
ridges cheddar and sour cream never
fried always real I really do like pop
chips I haven't tried the cheddar and
sour cream though I'm sure I will love
them and then be addicted to them but
I'm so full from all my chocolate oh the
next thing is this Hisi and Heisey I
don't know how to say it portable power
bank I actually have one of these in
pink and it's really good this one's in
blue so I might give it to my hubby cuz
I figure he will use it so that is
awesome I mean it works well it's really
sleek and small and we all need things
like that throughout the week I do
anyway um next thing is by dr. Dee
Schwab it's their flawless skin fluid
smells nice oh it does have a glow to it
can you guys see that on my skin there
it dad it definitely has a glow but it's
not like shimmery or glittery this would
be beautiful underneath foundation if
you just want kind of a glow but you
don't want it to be super obvious you
know next thing is this AJ hand cream
with evening primrose it's by lather and
this is definitely a full-size this
would be nice to just keep on your
nightstand you know so you can just open
it grab a little bit for your hand I
like that it's so big I mean just
because it oh it's like a nice almost
like whipped texture hmm and as we head
into right now like this wintry season
it's just so nice to have that awesome
so that is really really cool I will
definitely use that I think I'm
literally gonna put it on the nightstand
when I'm done filming I'm next thing
here are two brushes these are from
Oprah they have a green handle this one
it looks like you'd be really good for
almost like just concealer because it
feels like a foundation brush like one
of the classic Padel foundation brushes
but it's a little bit smaller so if you
look that'd be awesome for concealer and
that is what does it say number 20 and
then this other one is number 11 it's
got that kind of synthetic feel I mean
you could use it to pack on eyeshadow
maybe it's probably one I probably use
very often to be honest with you guys
okay yes this is from Oscar blondie and
it's their dry shampoo I love their dry
shampoo and I haven't tried it in years
I forgot about it but what I like about
it is it sprays clear and it really does
they used to have one that was like this
that I feel like sprayed Brown but maybe
it didn't maybe it was just that it
wasn't white and that's why I sue I
don't know but I love this stuff it's
one of the best in the world it is
pricey so it's awesome that it was in
this so and it's full-size I will
definitely use that up there next thing
in here is this cute little necklace and
I've gotten one from them before and it
said I think happy on it
this one says dream I kinda wear them
together and it's by Duke and Nona and
it just says it's just a little gold bar
and it says dream and it's so cute I
love these mine is not tarnished yet the
one that I've had
all right so the last thing in here is
this yoga towel and it's summer Andros I
like about these I have one in orange I
think from last year's welcome box or
from just another box I don't know
they're really really soft they're so
durable you can wash them in the washer
and tumble dry I'm a million times and
they look just as nice as they do the
day you open it so these are really nice
I actually like these colors even better
than the one but I even use these like
I'll throw these in my beach bag just
because they're you know thinners they
don't take up much room but they serve
the purpose of blocking you from the
sand but they're not as thick so I think
these are honestly I know their yoga
towels but they're awesome little beach
towels too so that was everything at all
of these boxes I love links for all of
these below I know this was very long if
you stuck with me through it
you are awesome you're a true blue fan
or you just really love subscription
boxes like I do other than that I hope
you'll check me out on my social media
which is right there on the screen and I
hope you subscribe before you leave and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
