going to be sharing with you a video
that I've been planning for like a month
and it's one that I think is really
important what I'm going to be sharing
with you are kind of my secret weapons
when it comes to taking care of your
skin and making it look healthy and not
dry in the winter time I have struggled
with this in the past but I feel like I
finally found quite a few products that
are working really really well for me
and I want to share them with you so if
you'd like to see what I would recommend
please stay tuned
so the first products that I'm going to
mention were sent to me from a company
called Scandinavia and this video is
actually done in collaboration with them
and I was excited to try these because I
have tried the finishing spray that they
sell and they it's amazing I've always
loved this but now they have a makeup
primer spray and they apparently I had
never heard of it no said what turns out
they invented it so look well I want to
explain why I never heard of it and I
have a feeling these are gonna become
I've already heard of a few others that
are out there now I have a feeling these
are gonna become really really big but
this one is amazing so when I use these
together I'm noticing that my makeup
stays on but not only does it stay put
it actually looks healthier it makes my
skin in my foundation or BB cream stays
in place but it also like just doesn't
it gets rid of any patches any dry spots
and it just looks healthy so I actually
have a coupon code for these the code is
winter 15 and if you use that coupon
code you'll get 50% off and free
shipping and to fre pocket size spray so
I thought this is awesome I don't want
the pockets full size ones now because I
want to travel with them and that would
be way easier but anyway so I have a
dental with me applying both of these
you can kind of get an idea of how they
work so let's go ahead and get into that
so as you can see by the mess behind me
I'm in the middle of getting ready but I
wanted to show you guys how I use the
primer spray so right now all I have on
my face is just my moisturizer it's kind
of been setting into my face for
probably about five minutes or so I blow
dried my hair while I let it kind of
in my face this really does have a
really light mist when you spray it
which I love because some of the ones
I've tried just you feel like it's like
attacking your face but with this one
it's just like chill and that's why I
like it so I shake it and then I just
spray it all over my face I did go crazy
like I spray a ton you don't have to
spray that much but I just like feeling
like I've got every part of my face so I
just kind of like to fan it off to give
it time to dry and then I apply my
foundation within a minute of letting it
dry I feel like applying your foundation
quickly afterwards just helps it stick
to the primer perfectly and I love using
this versus a traditional primer that's
like a cream because I don't feel like
I'm using something that could possibly
clog my pores this is just something I
mean I've been using it for a couple
weeks and it's just it really holds onto
the foundation okay so now I've gotten
ready everything but my hair is done so
I wanted to show you the finishing spray
now this is the one that I've been
familiar with that I've used before and
loved and this is just I think it's just
kind of been repackaged since when I
used to use it but same thing the mist
is really really fine it's really nice
and when I've been using these together
if you've watched any of my vlogs the
vlogmas videos I've been showing kind of
my skin after work before working after
work and it looks exactly the same it
just holds it in place but not only that
but it doesn't look dry and cakey
anywhere and sometimes when I use just
regular primers or other setting sprays
it doesn't always look as good so I have
been really really impressed and I've
been putting these suckers to the test
like after the gym after I mean teaching
those days are long so anyway so let's
try this one as well I shake it same way
and then I just like to fan it and I
usually just kind of keep my eyes closed
so my eyeshadow can kind of like dry the
way I want it to be I don't know that
that actually makes a difference but
that's just what I do
it just feels refreshing but yeah so
that's just kind of how I've been using
these products I've been really really
impressed so clearly I am totally in
love with these products especially the
primer spray I love both but the primer
spray I feel like
never use regular silicone primers
because my skin always just looks like
dry and patchy and every time I use a
silicone primer I break out and so I'm
like okay my skin doesn't like it I'm
just clogging my pores but this stuff
actually has like good ingredients and
it feels refreshing and it works as a
primer and it just kind of gives it like
kind of a sticky canvas to put the
foundation on or the BB cream I've used
it with BB creams which I'm going to
talk about here in a second and it works
so well because it also on its own kind
of gets rid of a little redness and
patchiness the primer does so it's just
like it really truly is a secret weapon
I will put the link below for these
products if you are interested in
checking them out and seeing what else
they have to offer I'm gonna move on I
could talk about those all day so the
next product I'm gonna share with you is
this elf daily moisture stick and this
product confounded me when I first got
it because it's a stick but I was like
do you just like put it on dry areas
like what what do you do and it says is
enriched with in oxidants and anti-aging
ingredients great cocoa Shea I've got a
lot I mean a ton of things but something
doesn't really mean much to me if the
product doesn't do anything you know
what I mean so what I have learned to do
is just get a little bit on your finger
and it feels kind of just weird like
bone like so you get a little bit on
your finger and it's not white it's just
translucent and you can just let me get
my mirror here anywhere like you have
crepeiness or just dry areas you can
just put it on top of it and it really
it doesn't mess up your makeup I cannot
stress that enough it's the weirdest
thing and that was why I grappled with
it for a while because I was like how am
I going to use this because I feel like
it's just gonna mess up my concealer but
it ends up like perfecting it and I mean
I when you've got that dry area under
your eyes there's nothing worse so when
you look in the mirror and you're just
like huh like you just feel so dry and I
love this so that is when I definitely
recommend really inexpensive the next
winter skin secret weapon is using a
great moisturizer my one of my fave
brand I love college toys I could talk
to them to death I also love CeraVe and
they have I buy mine at Walgreens they
sell them like everywhere you can find
them online anywhere - I like the facial
moisturizing lotion this is p.m. I like
the PM facial lotion morning and night
because it's extra moisturizing it
doesn't have an SPF so you'd have to
you'd have to layer on a another SPF
with it if you're wanting the sun
protection but it's just nice any of the
products are great I love this year of a
moisturizing cleanser while I actually
don't have it but that would be another
recommendation because it feels so
moisturizing whereas I feel like a lot
of cleansers I use or I have used can
kind of strip the skin that's one that
your skin feels nice that bees like you
almost feel like you don't need a
moisturizer after you wash your face
although you do but it's amazing I
really love this as well so I will link
both of those products below another
secret weapon is instead of using a
foundation in the winter use a tinted
moisturizer or a BB cream now I know a
lot of you guys love hike high coverage
I do too I can't deny that I absolutely
do too I mean who wouldn't want to look
as flawless as possible but I also know
that it's not always great for my skin
and it doesn't always look great
sometimes it can almost make it look
worse when you have those dry spots so I
have two that I'm gonna recommend a
drugstore option and an expensive option
the drugstore option is this Neutrogena
Healthy Skin glow sheers and it's their
illuminating tips moisturizer this is
the one I'm wearing today I think that
when you're pairing it with a really
good product like those setting sprays
and primer sprays it stays in place
I think alone it's not great you do need
a primer with it and so I've been
wearing this the past few weeks almost
every single day and I'm I love it it's
got great coverage I'm like I said I'm
wearing today and I'm in the shade fair
- like 20 I think this is the second
shade up I just like it um it's got it
has broad-spectrum SPF 30 it really is
it can cover some but if you've got like
some big blemishes you might want to
concealer with it but it does a great
job and if you're concerned about
coverage you can always put on a nice
powder foundation that has an
illuminating quality to it I always like
to avoid too much powder but some
powders are really nice because they
have that illumination where it doesn't
look powdery this is one of my favorites
it's the it cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination and I have it in
light I have been in love with this
stuff for quite a while now it's so
expensive and I hate that because I want
to repurchase it but then I'm like run
so I'm kind of I've got my eyes peeled
for a drugstore option I know the NYX
stay matte but not flat powder
foundation is pretty darn good as well
and it seems close I need to get another
one of those because I've used mine up I
love this stuff it's it's got high high
coverage so if you put on in tinted
moisturizers and you feel like you need
a little bit more you can dust this and
you and that's what I did and you do get
a little more coverage but it has this
illuminating quality to it that just
makes your skin look amazing I mean I
could just wear this over a lotion and
be good for the day it's beautiful I've
never fallen in love with a powder
foundation quite as much as I have with
this one I just wished for cheaper but
the other BB cream I was gonna recommend
has actually a little bit more coverage
still not a lot but a little bit more is
this doctor jar BB beauty balm
multi-action skincare this one has a
higher SPF it has an SPF of 45 but it's
got a little pump and this the packaging
is actually hard it looks like a squeezy
too but it's not I actually really like
this packaging it is wonderful but it's
expensive but this one has more of a
great tongue to it whereas this one's a
little more orange you can kind of tone
up or down either one anyway with other
products but it just kind of depends I
love both I mean they're different but
they're very similar and they're both
better for my skin than everything else
so that is one thing I'm thankful for
that I'm not putting a ton of chemicals
on my face every single day another
thing I like to do to help with my
under-eye region and how dry it can be I
like this elf i refresh I you guys know
I love elf and their because they're so
cheap and you they really do have nice
products this one is just a really
simple I think this is like maybe three
dollars it's just got a little
rollerball
and it's metal so
really really cold so when I first wake
up and I do this year round but I
especially do it the winter when I first
wake up I've moisturize my face I'll put
this on all around my eye and then just
kind of tap it in really lightly and it
just feels nice it's got some good
ingredients in it it feels cooling it
helps to kind of reduce them a little
bit of the baggage just cause it's a
little cool but mostly it just
moisturizes that area for me so it wakes
up eyes and moisturizes I just like it
it's cheap it's a quick step but I feel
like it really does make a difference
your lips get dry in the winter I have
so many lip balms that I love but one
that's always been around for me and
it's a tried-and-true favorite you might
already know what I'm gonna say it's the
CEO Bigelow my favorite night balm they
have my favorite lip balm which is like
a bigger white tube and I tried that and
I it did not moisturize the same way
this one did this one it smells kind of
lightly like is this the one that kind
of kind of smells like vanilla kind of
not really though it just has a nice
light sweet smell but it's a really
moisturizing balm it can look glossy if
you want it to like just wear it out or
on top of a lipstick but it's just
amazing I've gone through probably like
ten tubes of this it's wonderful you can
buy it at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works you can also
find it online
the last secret weapon is just using
more cream products on your face in the
winter one product that I you know I get
I just get dry like where my crow's feet
are coming in right here like with
highlight one of my favorite cream
highlights is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector this is one that I'm not I am
always skeptical when I see a lot and
I'm sure you guys are too when I see a
lot of people talking about the same
product like mmm like is everyone just
loving because they feel like everyone
else does and they should too and I'm
sure we all do that but this was one
that I finally tried and I was like okay
I get it because when you all just
squirt a little bit on the back of my
hand and then I'll get a simple actually
I'll usually place it where I want it
and then take a stippling brush and just
blend it and then you usually have to
wipe a little bit away it'll get too
close to your eye with a bigger
stippling brush it's just nice it
doesn't move
add the glow without looking like
glitter and sometimes I'd like that
glittery look like if I'm going out but
for every day especially in the winter
when I'm dry I want something that's
gonna look nice and healthy but not like
too much so this is one that I love this
is in the shade opal you can find I mean
they've got enough shades you could find
one that suits your skin tone really
well but this is one that seems to be
pretty darn universal other than that
like cream blushes are great I I don't
have a cream blush right now I got rid
of them all cuz I just don't wear them I
feel like they don't stay as well but if
you're finding one that you really like
that stays really well that's a great
option in the winter because then again
it's less powder on your face cream
bronzers all those kinds of things there
are a ton of amazing products out there
that are great for dry and flaky skin
please let me know what your favorites
are below so I can maybe try some more
out and just so that our little
community here can all see each other's
recommendations and suggestions and
maybe learn a little bit and find a new
product that they will love if you
