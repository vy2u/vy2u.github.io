going to share with you guys a ton of
products that were absolutely terrible I
am so excited to get rid of let's just
get into it
I've tried hundreds and hundreds of
pieces of makeup that one should called
pieces of makeup bottle and these were
some that I've held on to be
specifically for this video I know I'm
already coming across really really
negative and if you're new to my channel
I'm not normally this negative but I'm
just I'm almost excited to tell you guys
about these products that are just bad
because I love watching these kinds of
videos cuz I'm like yeah that product
does stink or whatever I kind of like
watching them but I'm not typically this
negative so but just be aware the first
product that I think is just across the
board not good and not worth even buying
even if it's on sale are the Revlon not
just nudes palettes now I am only eye I
had both of them I think I've already
gotten rid of one of them and I just
kept another just to be able to show you
I don't know like I've done a whole
video on them I would say about 3 or 4
the shades are actually pigmented the
rest are not like the this matte brown
one was good some of them are okay but I
feel like these drugstore palettes are
getting really expensive but they're not
really stepping up their game some of
them are great I really like the Laurie
Ola palette one um I really love the
Milani palettes oh my gosh but this was
just not good for the price they were
asking and you know if you needed some
colors in a pinch and you wanted to have
some variety I don't know but even still
there are better ones out there so I
just it's a Miss I just didn't like it
you want to see swatches of all these I
did do a whole video on them so I'll
link that below another miss product
were these wet and wild geometric
highlighting powders I think these were
limited editions so I don't know if
they're still out but I bought them
pretty recently and I had two different
shades this one's desert explorations I
can't even open it and like it's it's
like a pure purple white but then it
doesn't really show up that much and
then this one the more golden one was
called
ceremony and it was just kind of a it's
like gold and it doesn't really do much
so these just felt really powdery but
then they didn't really apply well and
then when you blended them they were
gone it was just all around bad and one
well actually makes some good
highlighters I love their reserve your
Cabana one so just skip these if you
still see them and buy the other one
because this is just so these next
products I was really wanting to love
and parts of them are really good these
are the Sonia Kashuk quads that they
sell at Target and I have three of them
I have fair and square I have bronze
beauty and then I also have shimmering
sands and it's the glitter shade in
these I didn't like the other shades are
actually really really nice and buttery
and like lovely but this glitter shade
which there it's just bad so you can see
they're all really powdery which I don't
mind you can get past that because
they're actually really nicely pigmented
but that glitter shade is horrendous and
it's the same in all the palettes it's a
different shade of it but they're the
same formula I guess because it's
basically just glitter but the glitter
just goes everywhere it's like thick
chunky glitter was not really any color
payoff with it which whatever but the
glitter just gets everywhere no matter
what you do you can't get it off your
face and the rest of the day you're
gonna have glitter everywhere it's
horrible you can't brush it off with a
fluffy brush you can't cover it and more
fun I mean there you're just you
absolutely would have to just start over
to get it off so no good so those are
ones I kept holding on to because I was
like I really do like the other shades
but I'm like you know what no because I
wasn't reaching for him cuz I hated that
glitter and it's just not worth it
these next ones I bought I buy I do a
lot of Dollar Tree hauls and I find
amazing makeup like expensive makeup at
the Dollar Tree it's ridiculous what you
can find but I've also branched out to
try some of just the LA Colors stuff
that they have there all the time these
six pan palettes if you will are no good
this one's called almost nude this one's
called Cal's haut H a ute and
like in these like one or two shades is
okay like the purple and this one's
amazing but then there are others that
are just like nothing like they're not
really doing much the purple really was
nice but the rest there's just not much
there and then it doesn't stay on for
very long so it's one of those that yeah
it's only a dollar but don't even waste
your dollar I mean you know it's just
alright so the next product is from
bourgeois Paris and it's their healthy
mix correcting concealer this might be
the worst concealer I've ever used this
is one that every I would say the three
times I'd tried to use it I had to start
my face all over again because I was
only like two steps in but I had to wipe
it all off because it was that bad the
problem with this concealer is that it I
don't even know how to describe it it
kind of any like weirdness you might
have like any crepeiness it almost
creates crepeiness I would use like any
other concealer and my eyes like under
my eyes would look fine they would look
great but then I would use this like the
next day and it would look like I was 85
years old I don't know how else to
explain it it's like it I don't know if
it's like this the product itself as you
blend it into your skin flakes and that
must be what it is so I've used it with
a Beauty Blender a brush and my finger
in all three ways it was the same exact
effect and it was instant it wasn't like
two hours later it was flaking it was
like instantly I've never experienced
anything like this
so stay far far away if you've tried it
and somehow it works for you then maybe
I got a bad batch but I've heard a
couple other people talk about this and
say they didn't like it either so I
don't think I'm crazy on that one these
are again I have a lot of Sonia Kashuk
in here I feel kind of bad I actually
like Sonia Kashuk but just the way the
cookie crumbled this is the primer base
the perfecting brightening primer and
the perfecting luminous foundation these
first of all the packaging is kind of
cute looking but it's like the cheapest
packaging ever um which you know you can
get past who cares if the products good
right I don't really know this is glue
it literally feels like glue it made my
skin look ghostly and not in a
brightened
just like in a really weird way and I
like like Mac strobe cream I like I was
thinking this might be similar it
literally looks like you put glue on
your face that won't blend in perfectly
and then once you do finally get it
blended enough if you pair it with this
foundation which is the primer it's not
my favorite but it's better than this
this foundation is like this thick
gloppy weird formula that never blends
in I swear
again I tried it with my hands with the
brush and with the Beauty Blender no
matter what I did I couldn't get it to
look normal on my skin and then once I
finally got it blended in enough that I
was like art I got to move on
it just looked it just settled into
every line I had and I just look like a
dry cakey mess and I feel like in this
day and age when so many drugstore
companies are coming out with amazing
foundations for around the same price if
not cheaper there's not I don't really
have patience for that because I'm like
really like did you guys test these
things out and you thought yes that's
great let's set it out so I don't know
maybe maybe this would work if you had
really really really oily skin but it's
a luminous foundation it shouldn't be so
cakey it doesn't really make any sense
to me so past that is a hard pass this
next one is from this brand the brow gal
by tonyia Tanya crooks and it's their
clear water-resistant eyebrow gel this
came in one of the subscription boxes I
love clear brow gel is left this weird
film kind of like I'm talking about glue
a lot but like if you remember when
you're a kid you put put glue all over
your hand and then you'd peel it off and
if you don't know what I'm talking about
you need to get out worse clew and try
it because it's pretty cool but it was
like that kind of feel to it that I
could like almost peel it off and it'd
be like anywhere that the brown gel got
that wasn't on my brows it'd be all over
the place and I'm like listen I don't
have time to worry about that a clear
brow gel should not be something you
need to fuss around with and mess
forever it should be a really quick step
and this turned into a nightmare the
like whole week I tried it out every day
it was the same
thing like an our end of the day I would
have weird dryness all around I hated it
so much so I'm so excited to say goodbye
to that
speaking of brows this next one I know
some people like this is the Maybelline
brow drama crayon and I just don't it's
such a big crayon and as I've only used
it a little bit it's really really
creamy which is nice because then when
you brush it through your brows you can
kind of use this bully and actually
spread the color throughout which I like
but you know for wear like for me my
brows get thinner out here that's just
naturally how they are I wish they were
a little thicker but they're not um and
so as this gets more and more dull it's
I mean it's already hard to get there
precisely and so as it dulls naturally
it's going to be even more difficult so
I don't really understand why the crayon
is so thick
I guess that's what I'm saying so unless
you have really thick brows or a way to
kind of shape this then I don't really
understand unless like maybe the back
comes out you can no it doesn't so
there's no shape or built-in so I don't
understand that concept
his next product are these Revlon Ultra
HD matte lip colors I saw a I think it
was a magazine ad for these or maybe it
was TV I was talking about these
products and they it said like the
number one something something I was
like what that product is horrendous so
I couldn't figure out what this product
was trying to be because it doesn't work
as just a matte lipcream because like
even with this darker color it appears
to be like nice and dark but if you look
at as you spread it out it's a really
thin consistency and it just makes your
lips look really splotchy and messy this
is in the shade addiction the other one
this one this one's a little bit better
than this one this one was in the shade
devotion and it really like as you
spread it out it's just this really thin
consistency that you can see through so
I'm like is this supposed to be a lip
gloss or a matte lip color it was kind
of like this weird hybrid and I just
didn't like it if you like that kind of
a thing then you you probably would like
it but for me and what I thought it was
and it didn't turn out to be I just
didn't like it for what it was so that's
kind of my own personal thing I
with that do you guys see what I mean by
it kind of a see-through so you'd have
to keep layering but then it moves
around and it's continually semi
see-through for me like today I'm just
wearing a lip gloss I don't mind if
something see-through but I like it's a
certain version of that that I want you
know what I mean this last one I'm gonna
mention is from M cosmetics I have it in
all fairness I've not tried much from M
cosmetics and I like Michele phone a lot
but this product doesn't make sense to
me this is the Valentine life seductress
edition oh it's the life palette mini
and so I guess that would be like a
bronzer these would all be eyeshadows
around it and then there's these two lip
products like a cream lip product why
are we still putting cream products with
powder products on the same palette why
how is that so happening because it gets
everywhere I'm never pulling this out to
do my lips like ever I would never think
to pull out a palette and that's just
again that's a personal thing so I don't
understand the combo here but on top of
that I just really wasn't super
impressed with everything the bronzer
was pretty good but the eyeshadows some
of them are good and some of them were
not and so again I just felt like a
little bit let down by this I wasn't I
love the packaging I will say that it's
nice and thick it feels really really
well-made it's a very nice mirror in
there and so I just think it I wouldn't
buy this again and I'm not reaching for
it I think because the eyeshadows are
kind of hit and miss I don't like that
there's lip products in there and so for
me it was just kind of a oh wait I've
got one more this is the Sonia Kashuk
extreme wear eye primer again I feel bad
bringing up Sonia Kashuk so much this I
was excited to be like maybe a dupe for
like Mac painterly or Mac soft ochre
because it looks just like it and those
are use those products every day first
of all it's hard to get your finger in
here it's a really small hole so you
would have to maybe use a brush but it's
not it's just a weird primer it doesn't
really cancel out much which is what I
was hoping it would do but on top of
that it just doesn't really do anything
I didn't notice that my shadows lasted
longer it was
very fun to use and so because of the
fact that it was harder to use it didn't
really do much it didn't cover much
painting it really wasn't doing its job
as an eye primer for me so I just felt
like what's the point so I stopped using
it and I've used everything else I own
and I never reached for this so those
were all the products right now that
have been cluttering up my little drawer
of products that I don't like that I'm
going to be passing on today some of it
if it's just terrible I'm probably
honestly just gonna throw away I might
let my sister's go through these and see
if there's anything they want cuz some
of these aren't absolutely run this but
