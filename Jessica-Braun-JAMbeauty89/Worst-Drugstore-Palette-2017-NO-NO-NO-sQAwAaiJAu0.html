going to share with you guys my thoughts
on the Maybelline 24-karat nudes palette
this is the fifth palette that they have
come out with and the packaging is
gorgeous gorgeous gorge wall part of the
gorge wall dude I would say that the
other day and my husband was like
rolling his eyes so hard I could hear it
from across the room anyway
um looks really pretty right the colors
are really gorgeous together they've got
some kind of more gentle they've got
some Schumer's they've got some s love
the golden packaging
well this sucker retails for $11.99
which $12 for a pallet that's kind of
become the norm in the drugstore which
makes me sad because it's like that's
not really that's starting to get out of
drugstore price but like you know you so
get 12 shadows so I could get down with
that that's certainly cheaper than like
a $50 or $54 for Mindy Katie Collett so
okay whatever I can get past that I can
use coupons I can wit for sale well I'm
so mad at myself for buying this I keep
getting suckered in and so I have tried
I think all of them I think the only I
haven't tried is the graffiti news
because it as much of bright colors I
just wasn't into but I've tried all the
other ones and every time I try I think
maybe this home will be better they
probably heard our cries from the last
one maybe this one will be better
and then that one's not good and I'm
like one maybe the next one would be
better well my fell into the trap again
and guess what it's not better I heard
from someone that supposedly and I can't
find it so maybe it's not true but I've
heard that they were trying a new and
improved formula no no no this might be
worse like the Maybelline blush news I
actually kind of liked that one was okay
I like the shade there were enough that
I could work with but this one it's like
they're going backwards so I thought ooh
this green one right there is gonna be
really pretty so I pulled it up and like
and so then I swatch it and I'm like
what so that I Michael maybe this like
purple one this nice deep purple so I
get a little bit I'm like maybe what
like these are just kind of like the
bland there okay it's again it could be
worse let's try another so
like well maybe this like really pretty
bronze there so I get it and like it's
okay don't you see how they're kind of
all blending to be almost the same color
so then I'm like well maybe I'll try
like this deeper Brown like okay Wow
iced watching might well that one is
actually very pigmented the golden one
is gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous this is
more like what I had thought they would
all be like and when I was first
watching this that was the first time
I'd watch myself they finally did it
they finally improved their formula
because it was so smooth so beautiful
well let's keeps watching so this is
like a kind of greenish gold pretty
color like kind of nothing there it's a
little bit this matte black is really
nice just like the matte kind of deeper
Brown was try this white so I better use
a different finger for that one
so trying the white like oh it's going
to be like a stark white no it's just
trails off let's try this kind of
shimmery champagne and like oh maybe
it'll be like that gold one no it's cut
it's alright it's okay see that right
there so it is that one is a little bit
more buttery similar to the gold not as
good as the gold let's try this black
shimmery one that one is very pigmented
so here was my consensus the dark brown
the dark black and the like black with
gold super super pigmented the gold
beautiful everything else it's like they
didn't even try it's like they're like
well we'll have four good shadows and
then the rest are fine like who was
trying this and thought let's put our
name on that let's put it on the shelf I
just don't get it I don't get how here
here's why I'm upset what I'm wearing on
my eyes today is a covergirl palette so
the true naked news from covergirl is
exactly the same price they're both
exactly 1199 retail this one is so
gorgeous now here's the thing it kicks
up powder it's not a perfect palette but
when you're spending $12 that's still
$12 that
what I would expect from a drugstore I
would expect that maybe all but one are
really good you know I would expect that
there's probably going to be one or two
shades but when more than half of the
palette is crummy that is really
disheartening for me I would rather deal
with powder being kicked up but they're
actually being color that I would with
trying and trying and trying to get some
kind of color payoff when I tried
applying like the purple and the Greens
they just blend together they look like
the same muddy kind of a color which I
don't mind that kind of a color it's
similar to what I have on my eyes today
but if I'm wanting a purple that day I
want a purple and if I want a green that
day I want a green I don't want it to
all kind of meld and look like the same
muddy color all over I just feel like if
you're going to spend your hard-earned
money on something you want to know that
most of it is good you know like I said
you always take drops or with a grain of
salt there's a chance that some of it
might not be great and that's okay
obviously it's not they're not working
with all of the same ingredients that a
company that is charging $50 for a
pallet is there's going to be some kind
of cutbacks or fillers or something we
all know that we all understand that
we're smart enough to get that but when
I can compare a pallet by a competing
company and know that it's miles and
miles above it even though it's not
perfect and they're the same price it's
like you've gotta at least match your
competitors you've gotta at least be
close so it is really disheartening
especially since and I am not usually
this negative if you've been watching me
on my channel this is very rare for me
to go on a rant about how crummy a
product is it really is and I usually
can find some redeeming qualities and
really the only redeeming qualities is
the beautiful packaging that gold shaded
gorgeous the dark like black is really
nice that's about it that is about it it
just made me sad because I really had
high hopes for it and I'm sure a lot of
you guys did too as they were turning
out more and more pallets if you're
interested in seeing some of my actual
like favorite things I would recommend I
will link my like favorites and sales
below if you're curious about you know
what do I actually like because I'm not
normally this negative I promise I
promise
promise now - I feel like if you bought
this 24 karat gold palette that you're
not ever going to be able to create a
decent look with it of course you'll be
able to create some stuff with it and
you know looking at it there's still
color there it's not but I felt like as
I tried to blend it together it just
blended away all into the same color
and you know with similar palettes I
felt like I should get different looks
with it I really like the eye look I did
today with this covergirl one it blended
really nicely and even when I got
somewhere it shouldn't be it still
blended together so seamlessly whereas
this just looked so muddy and just kind
of look I might as well have had one
shade because they all ended up looking
the same no matter what I did with them
this week but hopefully this was helpful
for you guys as you're searching through
drugs for Palace maids you're wanting to
buy some maybe you're trying to figure
out what to stay away from definitely
say stay away from that like I said the
covergirl ones they have a rose as one
that's really really pretty as well I'd
like to all of them the new one and it's
just one that I've kind of kept
throughout the years that I've just
really I liked the colors in it so
hopefully that makes sense to you guys I
hope it didn't come across as too
negative I know it was like super but it
is what it is I'm just trying to be
honest with you guys I hope that you'll
subscribe to catch more of my drugstore
videos and reviews and demos and other
than that catch my social media in the
meantime I like to share new products
swatches things I'm buying at the store
things I get sent for PR in the mail and
just different makeup that I'm trying
out so if you're interested in seeing
that in real time
definitely check me out there other than
that I'll see you guys in my next video
