doing a collab tag video with the lovely
Samantha March I adore her channel oh my
gosh I don't remember how I discovered
her I have no idea but I'm so glad I did
it had to have been maybe six seven
eight months ago because I love her
channel she's got original content she
is kind she's also a writer she's
intelligent
she loves makeup she recently kind of
got more into it which i think is
another reason I like her because I feel
like I'm learning alongside her I'll
link her channel she's of course doing
the same video she is the one that
actually created the video but we're
just kind of doing it for the first time
together but she sent me the questions
and I was like I love it and I was
trying to think of like were there any
other questions I could think of to add
and I could not think of any I was like
no this looks amazing let's do it
so I love I love love I love giving love
to other people that I adore and I do
adore her so I'm excited for you guys to
discover her channel I know so many of
you guys already watch her I just feel
sorry I've got like I'm obviously eating
and I obviously have stuff in my teeth
sorry um I think you guys will love her
if you don't watch her yet so let's go
ahead and get into the questions so the
idea of this is that it's YouTube first
so first so the first question of the
tag and of course they tag all of you
guys to do it and if you do definitely
give her a shout out because she is the
creator what was the first youtube video
you watched i have touched on this
recently and it was sammich or sam and
here on youtube she's still rockin and
rollin she's got tons of subscribers i
will link her channel below of course
along with anything else i mentioned
that i can link was i was looking up a
fountain okay the whole story is that my
best friend Sarah had been nanny for a
family and this woman she was 84 used
this one foundation that was really
expensive as a Lancome one and so Sarah
had bought it herself and she was like
oh my gosh I love it but I tried Sarah's
and it was like way and so I was like
maybe I should just buy for myself and
so I was like well let me look up some
more reviews on it things like that so I
say that like I knew about I said let me
Google this and see how much it is and
see like has anyone talked about
line anything like that because at this
time I did not know that YouTube was a
place where you could find makeup
tutorials things I had no idea and so
had to have been the year maybe 2010 let
me just say that because I started my
channel in 2013 so let's say it's 2010
2011 maybe no but I was back in India
hold on 8 to 9
yeah probably 2010 2011 so I looked it
up and hers was the first thing that
popped up and it was a video but again I
googled it so I clicked it it took me to
YouTube I'm like oh so I'm watching her
talk about she's applying the foundation
and in the end I must have liked it
because I ended up buying it I actually
found that exact video so I will link
the exact video that was the first thing
I ever watched on YouTube and I realize
it and it's so cool that it's so out
there I love when creators don't delete
their old stuff one please don't delete
it that's like history anyway so that's
just awesome so then I started watching
more of her videos and then I realized
oh I'm looking at the recommend I'm like
oh my gosh there's like tons of people
that do this so that's where it all
began and I remember I lived in an
apartment with my other best friend
Emily and I would just start watching
videos all the time and then I'd like go
to the store and start buying you know
little drugstore things and so very
exciting stuff I just it just makes my
heart flutter what I think about it I
feel like I use this mug every single
time I'm filming it's clearly my new
favorite mug what was the first YouTube
channel you subscribe to I don't
remember exactly but I want to say it
was like either Elle Fowler or Blair
Fowler and of course they still make
videos Elle doesn't really and I just
found out she announced she was pregnant
which is so exciting and I know Blair
Fowler still makes them but they're not
all Beauty focused they're kind of more
like vlog liking you know she's just
kind of morphed and grown with her
channel there's nothing wrong with that
and anyway so they both still kind of
make videos but I want to say it was one
of them that had to have been the one
that you know they would mention all the
time don't forget to subscribe don't
forget to subscribe don't forget and so
I feel like it had to have been one of
them that I first subscribed to and then
I started subscribing to a lot of
different people but I know that I
watched like all of their videos for a
long time I ended up I was like an L
Fowler girl like I like both of them and
I probably look more like Blair than I
do Elle mostly just go for hair cut but
I watched Elmore
and I could never really decide why but
I think she was just a little bit more
calming I liked both of them okay
and I did I will say they had their
glitzy glam shop and I remember I wanted
so badly I still want it I wanted so
badly they're freaking waffle weave
stuff they had like their waffle weave
headbands they had waffle weave little
makeup bags I'm like I want all of that
and I never ended up pulling the trigger
buying any of it and I don't even know
if they still have their website do they
do you guys know I still want the waffle
weave stuff you get your name I remember
I would like add it to cart and
personalize it constantly and then I
would never actually buy it because I
was in college and I had no money please
what was the first YouTube made me buy a
product you purchase again don't
remember exactly but it had to have been
the Revlon freaking lip butters those
were like everything for the longest
time I probably bought stuff before that
but that just sticks out in my mind I
own so many shades I remember my
favorite was peach parfait but then
looking back I'm like a head glitter in
it like what was I think I don't know
you know you just kind of learn and grow
but I remember loving that and so many
times I would sit waiting to pick up
these girls that I need from school it
doesn't matter and I would just like sit
in my car and like pretend to film and
like I'd have a new lip butter that I
bought that day like in between college
and going back to nannying and and I'd
be like this is the new color lilac
petals and just make it up a name and
put it on me like whatever anyway Oh
awesome
anyway so it just has again a warm spot
in my mind that product and I wish they
were still sold cuz I would now I want
to go back and buy him I wish I'd and
gotten rid of him but another one I
remember buying purely because of
YouTube is The Naked palette and I
remember the day I remember the old toy
was at where I went in and I was like
I've got my $50 cuz then it was 50 not
54 anyway like I'd saved up and I was
like today is the day I'm buying the
freaking Naked palette like all day like
I'm working and like so excited thinking
about it and I remember buying it and
literally for like 15 minutes in my car
after buying it I'm opening it up and
you know pretending to film of course
and i'm swatching it and just all this
stuff and it was such a glorious moment
because I had waited so long and I'd put
so much thought into that purchase
and so many people said I need it and I
still love it I feel like I don't reach
for it often and I really should give it
more love this is so fun so the next
question alone let me go back to it is
who is your first youtube friend or
first person you did a YouTube collab
with so I literally went to my videos
and if you didn't know get ready because
if you're gonna be busy all day long
doing this to all of your favorite
youtubers when you go to their channel
so like I'm on my channel and you click
videos not playlists or anything but you
click videos you can just sort or filter
them and it's automatically typically
sorted by date added the newest and so
if you click it and do oldest it'll
literally put them in order from the
oldest video to the latest video from
all of their videos so I just did that
which I've done a couple times and it
makes me giggle and I'll do that with
some of my favorite youtubers and just
kind of watch a few minutes of some of
their older videos and just giggle cuz
it's just awesome but so I'm scrolling
through looking for like my first collab
and it's it's exactly I thought it was
it's ok her name is Jorden Cheyenne here
on YouTube she's still rockin and rollin
and she's got like fitness videos now
too and beauty videos and she's just
awesome but it was crap makeup 2013
collab with JJ's beauty blog cuz that
was I think what she called her channel
then and hold on there's an ad playing
come on and I'll link this this video
below my like shoulder show I've got a
water bottle right behind me I've got
tons of jewelry I'm spinning it so that
is so much fun I will link that specific
video and of course I'll link Jordans
channel and so that's just so fun and I
remember I want to say I'd ended up
doing a couple of collabs with her but
yeah that was just so awesome gosh it's
like memory lane going for scrolling
through all those
all right next question is what was the
first youtube video you watched today um
we have a terrible we have a TV is a
really small TV in our bathroom our
master bath and we have our shower and
it's see-through so we can see the TV so
when it's like a work week and I'm
showering in the morning I have no time
and it'll wake Tyler up so I don't watch
TV but like today is Saturday that I'm
filming this I kind of pre filmed for
the week and so I was able to like put
my watch play playlist wipe my watch
later playlist up on the screen and
watch it and take my time shower gets so
awesome so I know that I watched s days
like best of 2017 like products she
loved from the year and then I also
watched Gotham East --is like skincare
favorites from 2017 and she's really I
don't know if she's actually a
dermatologist or not but she knows her
skin stuff like she knows her stuff so I
really like watching her so those were
like the first two videos I watched this
morning both very calming people like
most of the people i watch are very calm
except for live loves her makeup she's
not calm at all and I think it's Larry
this is so I have to be in the right
mood to watch her because she's got so
much energy but I think she is so honest
and just awesome and if you're not
subscribed to her you should last
question is what is the first youtube
video on your to watch list let's see I
just kind of cleared it out
kathleenlights Sephora and Ulta haul and
more luxury high-end goodies I don't
know if my problem is I sometimes will
watch her videos and then I'll think oh
I've already seen that then I had an or
I'll play it I'm like oh I haven't seen
that and I've already seen it I don't
know how I did and it's always with her
I don't know how that happens but that's
the first one other than the Gotham e
still one that I watched earlier I just
haven't removed but I also have I have
makeup I don't regret buying from
Samantha March on there got a closet
tour from Teddy pono Chien rachhloves

just recent absque ran for a long time
and then I recent I'm like she's back to
roll like I don't know I don't remember
why I and subscribe to her it doesn't
matter anyway I'm answering that
question more than I should but anyway
so if you're interested in doing this
video very nostalgic right definitely

definitely give Samantha March some love
