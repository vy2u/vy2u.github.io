doing a really fun video this is called
the YouTube beauty community tag it was
created by one of my actually favorite
youtubers Lisa Stevens she I will link
her video on her channel below she
created the tag and I think that's so
fun so I'll have the questions for the
tag if you're interested in trying it
and I love her and she recently she
worked at Sephora and she recently quit
her job and she's doing YouTube
full-time which is awesome because she's
uploading more videos I got hooked on
her because she does stellar stellar D
clutters and there's oh my gosh if
you're a declutter freak like me you
will love her channel but either way I
just I like her she's easy to listen to
she's calming and she's just like chill
and like normal and I like that about
her so I will link her channel and I
think this is just a fun video idea and
some of these questions I've addressed
in other videos so I might not go into
super detail I might let you know if
I've done a video on that topic I'll
link it below as well so if you enjoy
this kind of video give it a thumbs up
subscribe and let's go ahead and get
into it so her first question is what
are your favorite videos to watch so I
did talk about this al I did a whole
video on my favorite and least favorite
videos to watch but just in a nutshell
my favorite videos to watch de-clutter
videos I love but I also just like
videos where it's like true reviews and
especially when it's reviews on a lot of
products and one so if it's like a whole
brand best and worst I do those videos
because I enjoy watching those videos I
also do enjoy like enjoy everyday makeup
drawer videos I started that kind of a
video on my channel a long long time ago
and it's so exciting to see so many
people do them now yeah so the second
question is what videos do not enjoy
watching or my least favorite videos and
some of mine are like first impressions
I will watch them from time to time I
have done them on my channel I don't
think it's it's not like something that
I'm like never doing first impressions
again they're terrible but what I've
said is always say first impressions
with a grain of salt because it's the
first time they're ever trying it I
literally this week filmed a video about
products I've changed my mind on and
that's just it like I could try a
product for a month and do a review and
still change my mind on it a few months
later you know
so I always say I'd rather watch a
review instead of a first impressions
because at least they've used it for a
few weeks or a month
I just don't think using it once is
enough to go you know buy something so
anyway so that's my one of my least
favorite kinds of videos and I know I've
talked that to death so I'll link the
video if you want to hear more about all
of that and my thoughts towards a lot of
different things I talked a lot about PR
hauls on that and my feelings towards
that - I am so silly
I skipped number two that was number
three about my least favorite videos
number two is actually what are your
favorite videos to film I think my
favorite ones a I like ones like this
like I'm literally sitting cross-legged
I've got coffee here and I'm just
talking to you guys and I love these
kinds of videos I also like filming
declutter videos because when I'm in
that mood I love just like bringing the
camera to the floor dumping my stuff out
and just talking about it it's
therapeutic it's I just feel so good it
feels so good anyway um one other ones
do I really like to watch or to film I
mean I like doing any of these I really
do like doing kind of these videos where
I'm collecting products that fit in
whatever category I'm talking about so
like today I filmed a video of ten
products that I think are under hyped
and I enjoy doing that because it's a
collection of products I genuinely love
or a collection of products I genuinely
don't like and I think that's just fun
they're fun to film I like watching
those too and they're just different
alright so skipping now to number four
what is your favorite part of the beauty
community I think my favorite part is
that kind of knowing that we're all
freaking freaks about makeup I think
there's something so comforting in that
and when I first discovered this like
weird YouTube beauty world I was like
just looking up a foundation review and
I think I found like sammiches video and
I was like what is this girl doing like
what is this like she's talking to us
like she knows it's like it was weird to
me and I'm sure if any of you guys think
back to the first youtube video you aive
ever came across regarding makeup you
might have had similar thoughts like why
is she talking
she knows us like whoa I'm seeing her
without makeup and now she's putting it
on like why is it fast-forward it you
know all those things that they're weird
Dee the first time you see them and then
I'm like huh and then I'm like wait a
minute I wonder what do people think of
like this foundation at the drugstore
that I'm using right now I'm curious so
then I looked that up and I'm like and
I'm seeing all these something else in
my oh my god it's like in a movie when
like all these things start popping up
anyway so what is the actual question
I've literally lost track of what I was
even talking about Oh favorite part but
I love now now that I am so obsessed
knowing that all of us are and that
we're all weird about it and we love
looking at makeup and talking about
makeup and trying out makeup and you
know I'll watch videos on stuff that I
know I have no intention of ever trying
or buying but I'm just watching it
because I love makeup and I think that's
so cool and I also think it's really
cool that like you can find youtubers
out there that when you watch them you
feel like you know them and you
genuinely feel like if you ever met them
that you'd be like hey what's up like
they know you and you know they don't
and I think that's such a weird cool
thing I don't know so I think that's why
to me watching you do YouTube videos is
so comforting because I do feel like I'm
sitting down with a friend just watching
them listening to them you know and
they're letting you in on so much of
their life what is your number five is
what is your least favorite part of the
beauty community obviously there's
cattiness out there and I think that so
many youtubers stay out of it and I
think the majority of youtubers stay out
of it but you know there's that handful
that I don't think want to be a part of
the drama but they are and I think some
maybe I should say this I think some of
them don't want to be a part of it but
happened to be a part of it because
they're just such big youtubers and then
I think there are some that thrive on it
in a way not that they love it
but that they know that the more their
name is out there whether it's positive
or negatively the more subscribers they
just might get the more money maybe
they'll make the more you know whatever
might come from that there's that old
saying that I don't know clearly but
just about you know hey any publicity is
good publicity meaning you know even if
it's bad it's still publicity and if
it's just drama and that's getting all
around boy that's free publicity you
know
and I think that side of it that's why
I've recently talked a lot about how
I've kind of decluttered my
subscriptions and I don't follow a lot
of the bigger youtubers I do still
follow some there's some I absolutely
love but I do think that some I'm just
like you know what I always like force
myself to watch the videos why just
don't watch them but then when I would
see in my subscription feed I'd be like
I feel like I should so I'm still in the
loop but once I got rid of that and I
don't have that noise it's so refreshing
and I love YouTube again and I you know
it's it's cool so if you haven't done it
you should definitely try it I think
you'll be surprised so I think my to put
that in a nutshell my least favorite
part about the beauty community it's
just that some people maybe aren't in it
for the same reasons I mean some of us
obviously for many of us it is a job but
I think there's a way to have it be your
job and still be in it for the original
reasons you started it versus being in
it just for a job and you're just out
there to make more and more and more
money I don't know I mean who doesn't
want to make more money I get that but I
feel like I'm going around in circles
hopefully some part of that made sense
okay number six what motivated you to
start your channel I think I remembered
seeing like I would see all these makeup
collections and they were huge makeup
collections of course I'm saying that
and I'm sitting in front of like Alex
shores of makeup but I remember thinking
like all of this makeup is really
expensive makeup and I can't afford it
you know I was in college and I was like
nannying to make money just to like get
by and I had moved back in with my
parents at some point because I was like
okay I can't do this on my own like
there's no way until I'm done with
college like student teaching it's so
hard to have a job anyway so I was going
through all that and I would go to the
drugstore all the time after nannying or
like between classes and nannying my
schedule was weird anyway and I would go
to like Walgreens and be like ooh the
Revlon lip butters like that is always
what sticks out in my mind when I think
of the early days before I started my
channel Revlon lip butters and I loved
that one in peach parfait and just like
my heart flutters just thinking of
just Revlon lip butter isn't that funny
do you have a product like that I would
love to know below do you have a product
that like when do you think of like old
school watching YouTube videos your
heart just fluttered she was like oh
that was like the one like I remember
that I wanted all the shades but I was
like okay I can't afford to buy all the
shades so I had like peach parfait and I
think I bought maybe one or two others
but I would always get coupons in sales
and I was like so diligent and I still
use coupons and sales but and I remember
I would like sit in my car and I've told
some of you guys this like I've told
some of you privately I've said it in
videos this one know what I mean so some
of you have seen it but I would talk
about how I'd be like in my car like
okay so like doing pretend videos to no
one so this is I just picked this up
this is the Revlon lip butter and peach
parfait here's the swatch you can see
that okay um let me apply a little bit I
gotta do a whole fake video and it was
getting to the point where I was like
okay this is bad just got like you need
an outlet for this for real and so when
I finally started doing it or what I
thought about doing and I remember
calling my sister and being like Chrissy
I had this weird idea and she's like
where's older me and like so not
straight-laced cuz she's super goofy but
like she's just got her head on straight
and she's very adult for her age and
especially you know if you're rewinding
this back then she's just always been
very mature for her age and I told her
my ID I'm like is that weird like and
she's like well I mean I don't know what
you're talking about it is but if you
feel that strongly about it just do it
like Arnie you need my opinion it's like
yeah I guess Michael I don't know you
know I'm making every excuse so finally
I remember I bought like a really cheap
tripod on like for my phone my iPhone to
set on a big ol stack of books I said on
my floor and I just started and it was
so awkward and I have not deleted like
any of those videos I was amazed when
I've heard that so many youtubers like
delete or like their early videos like
why that wake made you who you are okay
if they're bad that's awesome that shows
how much you've grown and you've learned
about you know videography if you will
and lighting and anyway that kind of
broke my heart when I learned that about
a lot of people but all of minors show
up I mean I didn't be back if I've
deleted any videos it was either because
it was like something that I was just
like I don't know
I don't even know that I have anyway it
doesn't matter so that's kind of how it
all began
and so inspiration wise I think I just
felt like everyone was talking about
really expensive products I was like I
feel like we need more like drugstore
stuff like I can't afford that stuff and
I love like seeing about all the
benefits stuff and all I remember like
benefit lemonade was really big then and
I was like I can't afford I still
haven't tried does it even still around
um and like The Naked palette I couldn't
afford that and I was like even if I
saved up no way I'm spending $50 on a
palette you know um so I really wanted
to like talk about drugstore products
and of course yes I've branched out and
I do try em but that's why you'll always
see drugs on my channel and not just as
like an afterthought like oh I'm gonna
do this very separate drugstore video
but then every video no like I want to
infuse in most of what I'm doing because
that's why I started my channel four
years ago almost five years ago oh my
gosh that's why so why should I change
my like thesis that's not the right word
for it but you guys know what I mean
anyway whew that was long-winded number
seven who most inspires you on YouTube I
am literally getting emotional reading
that one I have an emotional wreck
anyone else
um that is so hard to answer I feel like
it's so hard to pinpoint one person but
I'm amazed at how many youtubers like
even new ones that are new to me Oh
watch them and I'm like they'll come up
with these amazing ideas and I'm like
why am I not doing that like I felt like
I'd gotten so complacent and I know I've
spoke to this so much but I was so
complacent with my channel and like I
was like you know I'm just churning out
by my monthly favorites and my empties I
might you know all those classic videos
that I do actually enjoy doing and I
watch like I like those videos and
there's nothing wrong with them but I
was like I wasn't really putting a lot
of energy into switching things up and
changing things up and I think because
YouTube has the beauty world has been
the same for so long
no-one's felt the need to shake it up
but I'll watch these youtubers with so
much smaller channels and I'll think oh
my gosh like
that's the fire I miss like that fire
where I'm like I you know you're driven
to be more successful and to find more
people that are like you that want to
subscribe to your channel and like oh
Jessica come on and I just feel like
that fire that passion you see it in
their videos and they're coming up with
these amazing ideas and that's why I've
tried so hard to try to be a little bit
more creative lately and you know if I
love an idea that someone did if they're
a smaller channel or a bigger it doesn't
matter I'll shout them out because I'm
like that is amazing it's so inspiring
to me and just the idea to shake things
up and who cares and not that you know I
don't care what you guys think but just
that you know who cares what the norm is
on YouTube do something different like
nothing great has ever been accomplished
by someone that wasn't willing to shake
things up there's a phrase for that new
movie about the is it the Barnum of it
Ringling Brothers whatever it is that
knew about the circus master I can't
think what Tyler's gonna kill me cuz
he's like dying to see that movie but it
was just you know he says something like
you know no one has ever achieved
greatness without being different or
doing you know I'm butchering the line
if I can look it up I'll put it on the
screen
but it's so true like why do it if
you're not being yourself if you're not
trying new things and just shaking it up
and keeping it interesting for yourself
and so to be that's inspiring I'm gonna
hold myself together and not let myself
actually cry cry number eight number one
thing you would change about the YouTube
beauty community this reminds me kind of
of like my least favorite part um I just
wish that the algorithm were a little
different and I mean that on behalf of
smaller channels because like I'm
mentioning all these amazing youtubers
that are coming out with such inventive
videos I wish they were more visible on
YouTube you know the problem is there
are these big drama II channels that are
you know of course they've got three
point something million subscribers of
course more people are watching their
videos but that just means also that
with the YouTube algorithm that it's
going to be also more viewed by people
that
subscribe to them you know what I'm
saying whereas there are these smaller
youtubers that have these amazing videos
that aren't getting these views because
YouTube's not recommending it because
they don't have as many views and thumbs
up and as much engagement you know all
those things that go into that algorithm
and what's going to be recommended on
the side of a video you're watching and
I you know I get why YouTube does it I
mean it's in their best interest and you
know it's in the interest of you to gain
more subscribers Beauvoir but at a
certain anyway I I feel like I'm going
around in circles I'm not making any
sense but I just wish that could be
switched up somehow and I don't know how
they would ever do it anyway number nine
number one advice for other creators or
new people starting out a channel if
you're gonna do it be yourself
there's why try to be like Jaclyn hill
or Nicole Greer
those girls are gorgeous they're clearly
incredibly successful but they're them
be yourself and I've said that in past
videos too but I'm realizing about
myself like I'm trying to practice what
I preach because I kind of left my
person at personality out of so many
videos recently and it was showing like
it was showing in my videos a lot of
years were like just I feel like you're
not and so be yourself if you're gonna
be weird and just you know honest in
your videos then be weird and honest and
guess what weird and honest people are
gonna start to follow you because
they're going to see them in you and
they're gonna like that you know there's
no point in conforming to what you see
everyone else doing because yes it might
be working for them but at a certain
point everyone's gonna be the same and
no one's gonna care or subscribe to your
channel because you're just like
everyone else why should they subscribe
to you you're doing the same thing
everyone else is doing but by being
yourself and showing your personality
that's why someone's gonna subscribe to
you you know you could be the most
conventionally attractive person in the
world but if you're not being yourself
that's kind of gonna show through and so
I've seen so many channels with these
gorgeous women and their smaller
channels and they've been around for
years and I think how they're so pretty
I'm so surprised they don't want more
subscribers
then I'll watch a video and I'm like
that's why I can't connect with you at
all like you just you know you're doing
everything you're you know you're
supposed to do as a YouTube beauty
person and it's just so boring everyone
else is already doing that you know what
I mean so just be yourself in all your
weirdness let it show through but that's
another thing like one thing that drives
me crazy is like when youtubers would be
like fake goofy I'm like don't force it
ah it's awkward to watch like like I
feel like I've caught myself do that and
I'm like no just can no that was so
awkward or all I'll say something and
it's like it was clearly kind of forced
and Tyler from the other movie like
Jessica no that was weird
it's awkward cut it out and I it's so
true that like you can see through it
and it's just like oh it's so awkward I
like I feel like you're trying to be
yuffie and it's just weird anyway okay
number 10 last question what do you love
about YouTube as a whole I think that
just connects back to what I said like
it's this cool freaking community where
we're all nerds together and like I can
be so incredibly specific about
something you know make oh it's just
like benefit Porefessional and most
people watching know exactly what
product can talk about that's weird
right like I feel like anyone else
that's not a part of this community at
least for a while well watch it be like
whoa what's benefit professional they
don't know that it's a primer and then
it's around $30 and you can get at
Sephora and Ulta and you know what I
mean like but it we have this common
language that I can compare a product to
something else like oh this is like the
tart shaped a pan you like got it go on
look if you get it and it's such a weird
we have like it's like a discourse
language like it's it's just a bizarre
thing and I think that is so freaking
cool makes you feel like you're a part
of this community this family even
though many of us will never meet face
to face but you feel like you know them
and I think that's cool too so I hope
you enjoyed this video I tagged all of
you guys to do this if you are a
youtuber tag me in it how do you do that
I don't know send me a link on Twitter
if you did it I would love to watch all
these I'm so curious about you know how
you feel about the YouTube beauty
community
where it's going and where it might be
headed maybe in a better direction you
know I feel like this is kind of a
tumultuous time on YouTube there's a lot
going on with YouTube and you know that
the behind the scenes stuff of YouTube
and how us as creators you know the
monetization videos but all of that
aside just thinking of the community the
beauty community what are your feelings
on it because I do feel like it's kind
of tumultuous and that a lot a lot of
things are being shaken up and I think
maybe for the better and I don't know so
other than that I hope you enjoyed I
hope you'll subscribe and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
