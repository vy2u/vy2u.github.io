going to be sharing with you some makeup
and beauty and some skincare and even
like shower products that people on
YouTube have made me buy and buy made me
I mean they inspired me so much in their
video that I was like I and adding that
to my little list on my phone of things
I want to try and buy and then I when
actually bought it so most of the things
that youtubers are baby-by i love but
there are a couple of things that i
ended up really either just kind of
feeling wishy-washy about or they ended
up being products i really just didn't
like and wouldn't recommend so if you
are interested keep watching i love
these videos and i think it's because it
makes me feel better about how much i
buy based on other people's
recommendations because when i watch
other people's versions of this video
like see i'm not crazy it's not crazy
that i have a note or actually it's like
a reminder list on my iphone of things
that if i see it at the store i am
buying it and it's always things that
i've seen on youtube it's never just
something randomly popping into my head
it's obvious someone telling me you've
got to try this so i am a total sucker
and i hope i got alone and this little
struggle of mine but let's go ahead and
get started
so some of these there have been like a
certain youtuber that inspired me to buy
a couple of things at different times so
we'll start with any kind of organize it
here so one of my favorite youtubers is
Tara baby Z and she I swear the
drugstores near where she lives end up
getting like the brand new items before
anyone because she always finds buys and
reviews things before I've even heard
about them I'm always amazed so I love
her and I love her channel but she
turned me on to this wet wild contour
palette
she had swatched I think both of the
palettes that are out but I bought a
caramel toffee because it was the only
one
fine but I was so excited because this
is you know I think four or five dollars
if you can find it they're sold at
Walmart and I just love it it's not like
the best contouring powder you've ever
used in your life but honestly you guys
for a drugstore version it's really good
I find myself still reaching for it a
pretty decent amount it's not like a
product that I bought just because it
was cheap and that I never used it I
actually really do use this so I don't
think it's an ideal contouring shade for
me which is why I don't use it every
single day but I do really really like
it so another one she inspired me to get
in might've even been in the same video
I'm not sure but this is another product
sold at Walmart it's by hard candy and
it's their glow all the way on grey
baked blush and it's in the shade punch
and again she had a couple of shades
that she swatched in that video but this
one I was so taken aback because it's it
almost comes across as like a
highlighter when you just swatch it but
it is the most beautiful blush and I
love it and it's it stays on longer than
you would think and I feel like hard
candy products can be very hit-or-miss
which is true for most brands honestly
but it's one of those blushes that when
I see it in my drawer I smile and you
guys know I've decluttered most of my
makeup questions so the blushes that I
have left are ones that I really truly
love so this is one that I really truly
love all right so let's move on okay
it's Kendra here on YouTube or maybe
it's called vlog with Kendra she has I
think a couple different handles but I
really like her she does a lot of
natural and organic based videos about
skincare and makeup and she turned me on
to this everyday minerals brand and this
is their cheap product in Primrose and I
don't think this is the color she
mentioned but she just mentioned that
she really likes the everyday minerals
stuff
and she had it shown one of the blushes
these are absolutely gorgeous I don't
know if it's showing up but they look so
flawless on the skin they're just
beautiful I've ended up after buying
this one on Vitacost I ended up going
back and buying another one on Vitacost
in a different shade um that's a little
more cool tone this one's more warm I
love them both these I've travel
this one I think I wow it's really
powdery though because it's a mineral
product a lot of mineral products break
me out but these don't and I'm very
thankful for that and I just love them
they do not budge all day they're one of
the very few blushes I've used that
truly when you put it on in the morning
it stays the exact same the entire day
it is absolutely trustworthy I love it
so much and I travel with this sucker
all the time as well for exactly that
reason it's just fuss free and I have I
love Vitacost I love it but I have a $10
off like referral link down below if
you're interested I love it they have
all kinds of they even have bare
minerals on that site too okay um okay
Emily now well 83 I love and she
recently mentioned me in a video and you
guys have to know that I like lost my
mind because I've loved her for years
and years and years even before I had a
channel so hearing her even utter my
name was like the coolest thing but she
started doing an everyday makeup drawer
based on my series that I created so I'm
very excited about that because I love
watching those videos but she just
turned me on to one two three four
different things that I am going to
mention today so and she's probably
turned me on away more but these are the
ones that when I look through my entire
collection that stood out to me and I
knew it was her that made me want to try
it one of them is a skincare thing this
is the Fremen diamond mineral rinse mask
she had mentioned in a video pretty
recently I like it I'm not big on masks
and these little packaging like I would
rather I actually like this a decent
amount I would rather just be in an
actual bottle and I know Freeman has
that for some of them but I'm not sure
that they sell this it has an amazing
smell but sometimes with masks you don't
necessarily want a lot of smell in it
because then it's fragrance that's in
there that could irritate your skin but
I've used it once I like it there's a
couple more uses in here I'll probably
use it I haven't really noticed a
significant difference in my skin but I
mean you know masks are so different
depending on the person and their skin
she also turned me on to the bare
minerals well rested I'm right nur I
love this stuff so much you guys it's
like when I want to look flawless in my
under
and I don't want to mess around trying
out different products I always reach
for this one because I'm actually not
wearing it Sam I was using an every new
minerals one but it just always makes my
under eye look bright but not patchy and
not dry but not too luminous because
sometimes different products are either
too glittery almost or they're just so
dry that it just makes it look cakey
this is just the perfect balance and it
stays that way all day I love this so
much and if you're wanting to splurge
like 20 dollars on an item that will
make you feel glamorous but also will
last a really long time I would
recommend this this is one that when I
run out I will definitely repurchase
definitely without blinking an eye all
right next item she recommended I think
it was her is the NYX control freak
eyebrow gel this is lovely because I
love the anasazi of one but I'm always
wanting to not spend that much money on
eyebrow gel and this one's pretty good
because it actually holds but it's not
crunchy so if you know that you don't
like it when your brows end up looking
crunchy or feeling crunchy you'd like
this cuz it's kind of right in between
where it really does hold and if you use
too much it might be a little crunchy
but it's just the perfect amount some
eyebrow gels are just too wet for me
where I just feel like oh like they're
they never dry and they just look weird
this one doesn't it looks absolutely
beautiful and it's like five dollars so
definitely love that recommendation and
the last time only Noel one is this
Laura Geller highlighter in French
vanilla now this is the duo and it has
French vanilla in Portofino in it and
you can mix them and make a beautiful
highlight like for right here but she
always loved the French vanilla one for
setting her under-eye now I have to
admit I was a little too dewy for me for
setting my under eye but I've only used
it that way a couple of times but every
time I did I was like it might be too
much for me but I already have kind of
oily like just this whole region seems
like it's always oily which it might be
a good thing I don't know but because of
that it's too much for me but I just
love this combo in general just as a
highlight so love this it's absolutely
gorgeous
now laura geller products I can't use
all over my face like some of them have
broken me out like the balance and
brighten I gave to my mom she loves that
product so
she loves it so much but for me it broke
me out so this one's been fine though
because I don't typically break out in
this region so that's not really a
concern for me all right the next one
I've got a few randoms but this one
Holly eats lipstick here on YouTube but
I also adore she got me to buy three
different products I'm gonna mention
from one of them is lip sole or lip so I
don't really know honesty and silky
Swedish beeswax lip balm and she's all
about lips I mean her her handle or her
user name is Holly it's lipstick but
it's just it truly is a lip balm and
there's this little B on the side that
you like a literal honeybee well not a
literal one that's anyway did you guys
know well I heard this that because we
so miss use the word literally that
there it now does it now no longer means
literally it now means like literally or
figuratively you know what I mean if
that made sense to you I just dive and I
heard that and I think about it all the
time because we really do I really do
say I'm like literally there were a
hundred firefighters there if that's
like a Dane Cook joke if you know that
joke anyway Wow total tangent so this is
really nice it's not my favorite lip
balm in the world because I found my
favorite lip balm and it's the knocks
are the nooks lip balm mmm it's so good
anyway but this is really nice and out
of the stick lip balms I tried it
probably is one of my top one or two
because it's good and never has dried
out my lips and it just feels good so
thank you for that Holly and then she
also turned me on to the NYC smooth skin
loose powder now I take out the sifter
because then you can really get your
brush in there but it's like three
dollars at the drugstore I bought mine
at Walmart and it just is a beautiful
way to set your foundation where your
foundation is not going to move but it
does this doesn't really make it look
cakey and then it's just in the shade
translucent unless you use like too much
but it just really makes everything just
stay put and look a little more poreless
if you will I really really like this
stuff a lot and then she also got me to
buy the master prime by face studio blur
and smooth primer by Maybelline and I
like this stuff it's on my favorite if
you've seen my top 5 drugstore primers
video it's on there because it still is
really good I'm just not big on primers
in general I think that's the problem I
just but this one it feels really nice
when I've worn it I think it helps a
little bit with my foundation but I
don't think it's life-changing but I
know she really likes this and I don't
think we have the same skin type mine's
just kind of normal my just kind of
normal I want to always call it combo
because sometimes it's oily here but
then other times the year it's dry but I
think that really is normal like with
the seasons so I don't know okay next
one one of my favorite youtubers is
Alison Anderson or her username used to
be a Murray AMA r IX e in mice Toby but
she turned me on to this benefit
creaseless cream shadow in RSVP and it's
just this gorgeous light kind of pinkish
metallic cream shadow and it is so
beautiful I know I think I saw she was
doing like a travel makeup video and I
loved that video do you ever have videos
in your mind that you just think about
and you watch more than once for no
reason other than you just liked it
is that weird do you guys do that I do
that anyway I love that video I wouldn't
know it was like a year ago I want to go
back and rewatch it but I know she was
going to Europe and I was just like
excited for I'm weird
anyway but it's just gorgeous gorgeous
cream shadow these are really nice
they're kind of expensive for what they
are in my opinion there are nice cream
shadows but I don't think they're like
anything better than the Maybelline
Color tattoo but I love this shape and
that's what really sold me on it because
it's not too pink but it's not too like
champagne II either it's just right in
between and I really liked that and this
was one that I had in my cart for like I
think I'm sure on like Sephora ulties
website for ever like probably a year
before I finally recently bought it so
actually I bought it I forgot I bought
this when I was in Paris that is very
poetic anyway
this next one was a purchase based on
pretty neat living here on YouTube she
used to have a different handle why do I
keep calling it a handle I don't
that's what it's called on YouTube why
is that like in my head but her name is
Jen and now her channel is pretty neat
living I love her she is very verbose
when she explains things but I like that
about her because I can be very verbose
as well but she loves this palette and I
do - it's the Too Faced natural eyes
palette you guys know it ended up
becoming just a holy grail for me and I
even found a cheaper like eight dollar
dupe of this from hard candy and I can
link that if you just saw that pop up
I'll link it up here and down below as
well because that dupe it's from hard
candy is really really good too and I
kind of compare with swatches the
differences but I love this palette and
she was the one that turned me on to
this so alright the last few are like
body ones and some of them were from
really big youtubers that got me to buy
these although some of these were really
big youtubers - anyway um this one well
this one was from Shannon Sullivan here
on YouTube that I love she again is kind
of like Kendra that I mentioned earlier
where she does a lot of like natural and
organic focused videos but she likes the
a cure brightening facial scrub and
unless this was from Kendra I think it
was Shannon Sullivan anyway I like this
stuff and I have had in my shower it's
still I mean I'm still using it but I
finally looked it up on Beauty pedia and
it said it wasn't totally great for your
skin like man but I think I'm still
gonna use it up cuz I don't it didn't
say it was like terrible like ruining
your skin it was just that it doesn't
really do a lot and it can kind of be
very abrasive which I had kind of
thought in my head on what this does
feel pretty abrasive for a scrub and it
has a very specific smell and it's black
so it'll get like well it's like dark
green it gets in your shower and it's
kind of hard to get off I'm like there's
a lot of downs with this but I do still
like I'm gonna use it up but I don't
think I'm gonna buy it again I bought
that one on Vitacost as well alright so
this one was Dulce candidate can't
tenday Dulce candy here on youtuber is a
Dulce candy I've never really known she
had recommended this in a video within
the past year it's the shea moisture
moisture african black soap body wash
and she was saying that this is just
it's made her skin so glowy and just
smooth and like even not the
pigmentation of like her arms and her
legs and I'm like that sounds amazing so
I went and bought it at Target and it
it's like a it's got like little
granules in it so it's kind of
exfoliating it kind of smells musky like
a kind of smells like a cologne but I
don't really mind that much but I really
have not noticed the difference in my
skin and I was so low as she described
it I was like oh definitely it's gonna
be this amazing thing and I bought
plenty of other things based on her
recommendations and they were great but
this was one that I I don't think it was
bad but I just really wasn't as
impressed with it as I had hoped I would
be and the last one I'll mention is from
glam Life guru top two here on YouTube
loves I keep saying here on YouTube
obviously all of these people are here
on YouTube that is the whole video I'm
so sorry guys she loves this stuff this
is the Jergens BB body perfecting skin
cream and she said it just makes her
skin it's like makeup for your skin but
it's not as thick I love this stuff to
you guys it's great because it's kind of
between regular lotion and like the
natural glow type of lotion where you
know if you do get it on weird it smells
kind of weird and it might make your
skin look a little too dark in certain
areas not really like a self-tanner but
kind of close this one you just want to
worry about and it really is like makeup
for your skin it has it's not even gone
yet I'm thankful kind of expensive for
this but it has kind of a color to it so
if your my skin tone it would work well
but I they need to get like darker ones
out but as you kind of blend it in it
really does kind of perfect your skin in
that area and it has a beautiful smell
beautiful smell it's very delicate but
it does have almost like a perfume smell
I am in love with this stuff and I can't
believe this is the first one I've ever
bought I brought it in medium to deep
because it's not really changing your
skin tone but I really does make it look
I know you can't see in here but it
really does make everything look even
especially like your legs and like my
thighs like it really does make me feel
so much more comfortable wearing shorts
and things like that so I'll certainly
mention this in more videos as we get
into the warm
months again because it is absolutely
beautiful and it's become an essential
for me during those former months I hit
myself in the eye with this just now
kind of hurt not the eye but like this
region so those are all of the things
that I have in my collection currently
that I can remember being inspired from
a youtuber to buy hopefully you enjoyed
this and I can link any other youtuber
related videos I have made I've made a
couple I made one video about youtubers
that I trust that I just love I'll link
that below I made that before I was
married actually so I'll link that below
and I also made one about just tips and
tricks on making a YouTube channel and
you know kind of things I've learned
along the way and I'm so my gosh I'm
still learning so much but I'm sawing my
journey but to help you at least if
you're in the beginning part of your
journey or at any point in your little
YouTube journey so I'll link both of
those below because I'm very proud of
those videos and I hope you'll subscribe
