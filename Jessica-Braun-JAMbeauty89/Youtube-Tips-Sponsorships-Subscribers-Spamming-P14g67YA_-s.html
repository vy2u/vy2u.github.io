and having a successful YouTube channel
so let's go ahead and dive right in the
most important thing you've got to
remember whether you've already started
your channel or you haven't yet or
you're just thinking about it is know
yourself and be yourself because there's
nothing more obvious and worse than
watching someone that they're not being
themselves and that's not to say you're
not allowed to be giggly and silly
that's not to say you can't you know but
I feel like so many people get lost in
these bigger gurus and they you know you
can usually tell if someone loves a
certain part of you t person on YouTube
they almost start to morph into them now
there's not anything wrong with being
inspired by others and by even using
their ideas or using a similar makeup
shirt I mean there's nothing wrong with
that but when you start noticing in
yourself that oh my gosh like I'm not
acting like myself if you feel like
you're turning on the camera and then
suddenly being someone completely
different then you're doing it wrong and
there's no value in that what value
would you take away yourself as a person
knowing that you're you know you might
gain some viewers but you're not gaining
them for your own personality or your
own self it's because you're pretending
to be like someone else so what my
second one is don't be scared to be
inspired by other people but make sure
you give credit where credit is due if
you're inspired to do a certain type of
video that no one's really ever done
because you saw someone else do it and
they just started it give them credit
put the link to their channel you know
it's really easy
whether you verbally say it or just put
it in the description box it's a nice
thing to do it's just good business my
next one is regards to sponsorships so
many people have questions about
sponsorships a sponsorship is when a
company contacts you and basically says
if
you will review this product or show
this product in your video usually it
depends on whether they want you to show
it or maybe use it in a video whatever
but they'll outline that and they will
say we will pay you this amount of money
it could be a lump sum sometimes it
might be based on how many views you get
etc now a sponsorship you have to list
that that is something that you can get
in big trouble if you don't have it in
your description box for the FTC to see
this is a sponsored video now the
difference would be if it is something
that was sent to you for free for review
that is not a sponsorship so many people
confuse those the sponsorship is winning
you're getting paid to show it when
you're getting something for free but
they're not giving you any money at all
you're just getting the product you
still have to say that it was sent for
free it's the same idea that the company
was giving you something in exchange for
you mentioning it so it's the same idea
as a sponsorship but there's not
necessarily monetary compensation for it
so knowing the difference between those
two is important but either way you have
to list it now in a lot of contracts
with like for especially for sponsored
sponsored videos you'll have like an
actual contract to sign they will list
out you know that they want you to show
the product for this many seconds or
make sure you put this link in the
description box or you have to mention
it first in your video whatever it is
you do have to follow those rules but
what my advice to you would be is to be
very cautious about what you're picking
because the more sponsorships you do
yeah the more money you make but you
don't want to risk the trust from your
viewers and you don't want to take so
many sponsorships that every video
you're pushing out is sponsored and no
one really knows what you actually like
and what you don't you want to pick
things that you do actually like and a
lot of companies will let you try out
whatever it is the one you talked about
before you sign a contract so you can
really kind of determine whether or not
you'd want to sponsor this because you
don't want to agree to something then
try it be like oh my gosh this sucks but
oops I can't sign a contract so I got to
do a video on it and it's got to be
positive like you want to make sure you
like it
for you ever sign anything so that would
be my advice read those contracts try
the products so many people review
things that I know are terrible and then
I see them talking in a video and of
course they got listed that they're
sponsored you know they did all that
right but I'm like girl you're lyin like
it's not so you know be cautious of that
because you don't want to sacrifice your
trustworthiness for you know a hundred
dollar sponsorship it's like you've got
to think about what is more important
when you're doing this and why you're
doing it
my other advice to you would be if a
company is reaching out to you to just
even just send you maybe a lip balm to
try I mean whatever it is be honest with
them before they even send it to you and
say okay but I will be honest about my
feelings towards it in a video so if I
do decide to put it in a video whether
it's a favorites video or a haul or a
review whatever tell them up front that
you're going to be honest some companies
will not send it to you or they will
some companies will even even if they're
just sending you free products they'll
have you sign a contract it's not quite
as official but they'll obvious sign a
contract that says I will be I will give
this I will show the product in a
positive light and you have to sign it
before they'll send it to you and
there's been a few times that that's
happened and I've written backed and
said no thank you
because why would I agree to that I mean
that's just silly when I could I mean
really if I really wanted to try it I
could just go buy it it's not like it's
a million dollars they're trying to hand
me so it's just not worth sacrificing
your trustworthiness for any of it for
up for a new lipstick that's not worth
it you want to make sure you like it
beforehand so be very wary of companies
I have a contract that says to show it
in a positive light especially if
they're just sending you a product for
free because that usually means there's
maybe something people realize about it
that's maybe not so great another one
equipment you can start out using your
phone that's what I did the entire first
year and I
people asked me during that first year
of filming videos people would ask you
know what what equipment do you use it's
such good quality I'm like my iPhone and
I bought on eBay you can buy like little
tiny tabletop tripods that will fit into
your phone you can find one for your
phone model even if it's a droid it
doesn't matter and then you can just set
it on top of whatever I had it set atop
a table and then on top of books just to
get it the right height and it was just
in front of my window so you know you
don't have to go out and spend I'm I
feel now at the Canon t5i
I already see how I could have spent a
lot less money on a camera that really
would it be just the same quality but
this just not got all the bells and
whistles that I really don't even use so
you know really be do your research you
don't have to spend a lot of money and
lighting I use my bedroom window I don't
have artificial light so eventually I
would love to have that because it will
up the quality of your videos but you
don't have to have it I'm in year two
and I don't use fake light I don't even
own them so editing wise there are tons
of free programs out there I started
using Windows Movie Maker and got pretty
good at that but there are a lot of
limitations you can't do as much with
that
however iMovie you can do just a little
bit more and so when I switched over to
a MacBook Pro that's when I started
using iMovie and there's a lot more you
can do with that you can buy lots of
really expensive programs I haven't
gotten into that yet really I don't see
the need for it yet because I movie does
everything that I need it to do there's
not really anything I'm wishing I had
just yet so and then for like thumbnails
and pictures there are tons of free
websites my favorite is picmonkey.com
and it literally like you can make
collages you can change the size so it's
the right size for like a YouTube
thumbnail and then you can add words and
do pictures and do you know words that
are kind of like with a faded but I mean
there's so much you can do and it's all
for free
so there's no reason to buy any of that
kind of software either because you
don't need it there's a lot you can do
for free another tip is that you don't
have to get lost in what everyone else
is doing when it comes to the types of
videos everyone does you know I'm trying
to think of like the class
SiC beauty guru videos there's like get
ready with me
look books I wrote some down Oh like a
hole for every season or every time
there's something new at the drugstore
monthly favorites video swatch videos
tutorials I mean there's so many that
like tons of people do but you don't
have to do every single kind and a lot
of people asked me like why don't you do
more tutorials and I answered that my
last video but the main reasoning was
just that I I'm not I don't that's not
my forte I just like makeup but I'm not
necessarily amazing at all the different
things there are tons of makeup artists
out there that do videos that would do a
way better job than I would so there's
no point and just adding mine to it so I
do them from time to time but they're
not that often and I don't feel the need
to do it because it's my channel and I
can do whatever I want with it it
doesn't have to be just like everyone
else's I don't really do look books very
often / no I've never done a lookbook so
I don't have to so there's no reason
putting the pressure on yourself to oh
I've got to do a lookbook because one
person requests it and I've got to do
because the reality is if you don't have
an interest in doing it it's going to
show through in your video so don't even
bother just do what you genuinely want
to do because it's your channel it
doesn't matter
like it is such an empowering thing when
you finally realize like oh wow just
because two people didn't like this
video doesn't mean that I shouldn't do
this kind of video because I liked it
and other people like it and it's my
channel like it's so it really is
empowering the last thing I'll talk to
you guys about is to just stop spamming
everyone I feel like when you first get
started everyone else sees like people
with channels spam and when I say spam I
mean like people that will send like the
same exact copy and pasted message and
put it on it in a comment on like
everyone's video ever and it's so I
don't think I've ever looked at anyone's
channel that's ever done that because
I'm like I just feel like people are
looking for
there's no shame in plugging your
channel but doing it in a more authentic
way and not in a copy and pasted way you
know like the ones that I've looked at
would be ones where someone maybe they
watched like my makeup collection video
and they they wrote below and said oh my
gosh I use the exact same this and how
do you feel about this product and
they're actually talking to me and then
they'll say you can see what I'm talking
about in this video and I'm like now
clearly they were plugging their channel
but they didn't no way that at least you
know that they actually took the time to
watch your video and that they you know
care it at least a little bit whether or
not they're subscribed to me I don't
know but at least they took the time to
make it more authentic and that is the
way to gain true subscribers because if
you spam a bunch of people you might get
some followers right off the bat but
odds are those people will eventually
unsubscribe you know especially it can
just be such a mess it's not worth it
it's just it's just not and I'm I feel
like it just cheapens your channel in a
way that's my honest opinion so
hopefully those tips helped you guys if
you have already started a channel or if
you're thinking about starting it those
are kind of things that are always on my
mind when I think of making this video
if you have other questions or more
specific questions put them down below
I'll either answer them then or maybe
I'll even do another like maybe a part
two for this video but hopefully it was
helpful and thumbs up subscribe if you'd
like and I'll catch you guys soon bye so
the first thing I pulled out of the box
was the calming yogi tea and this I
bought two of and it says that it eases
mild tension I had this one last night
and it it's it is really calming but I
feel as though there was some flavor in
it and I'm not sure what it was that I
was
that I didn't love for when I have a
cold and my throat is really sore there
was something that kind of bothered it
so I think this would be fantastic for
if you're totally healthy and you want
to call me tea but I did not like it on
the sore throat for whatever reason so
