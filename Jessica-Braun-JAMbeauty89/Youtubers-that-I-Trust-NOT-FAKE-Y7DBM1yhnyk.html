bringing you my favorite youtubers and a
lot of you guys have asked who I watch
because I talk a lot about how I will
quickly unsubscribe from someone that I
don't feel like I can trust and it's not
to say it's people that don't do like
sponsored videos because there's nothing
wrong with doing sponsored videos so
some of these people do but they always
disclose it because then it's kind of
the balls in your court if they disclose
that it's sponsored it's up to you
whether or not you want to believe them
these are the people that I trust that
even if they're doing a sponsored video
that they're actually still giving their
honest opinion that's what I'll say so
the very first person I want to mention
is Jen loves reviews she is one of those
people that I watched before I even had
a channel and she is one of the biggest
inspirations for me when it comes to
being honest and anything like that she
just is so upfront with you and she is
also a teacher so I just instantly liked
her more but I just like her and her
channel she's always got some new video
up she does this really cool thing on
Sundays called what's up and makeup and
it's like a news show and basically
she'll let you know about all the new
things going on a makeup that week so if
like a new line was launched from a
certain brand she'll mention that and
talk about you know the different things
offered in that new line or just
anything new that's happening she brings
up and it's so cool to watch because I
always feel like okay like I start my
week feeling like I'm really in the know
about what's going on and I just think
it is so cool and she also does like a
live chat that same day so you can chat
with her and ask her makeup questions
she inspired me to do a similar thing
with that live chat which i think is so
much fun and yes I'm going to do that
again I know a lot of people have asked
I will do it again but I'll be sure to
let you guys know ahead of time next
time another person I want to mention is
it's Kirsten here on YouTube and she she
makes me laugh so much now if you you
guys know I don't curse or anything on
my channel she does so if you know that
that offends you don't even click to our
channel because she definitely does but
she cracks me up
and she's one of those people that will
say
exactly what everyone's thinking I'll
leave it there she is so funny and she
feeds my she does a lot of hauls and
buys a lot of things so she kind of
feeds my want to get new things kind of
problem by the way what do you guys
think of this set up I don't know we'll
see it's different because I haven't
used my ring light even more than I
usually do so I look a little bit
different but I like that you guys can
see like my vanity so I don't know I'm
gonna mess with a few things I'm only
gonna be living here a few more months
so I guess it doesn't really matter
another person I wanted to mention is a
love tart Mary she she used to call
moist and she's one of those people I
like to watch when I'm just like winding
down maybe I'm going to bed or getting
ready for bed or in the morning if it's
early she just has such a calm voice and
she's kind of decluttering her
collection as well so I love watching
those and I have loved her for a very
long time a lot of my purchases have
been based on her and she used to live
in Chicago or maybe she still does I
don't think she still does but I used to
- so when she talks about Chicago I get
all excited and the first I wanted to
mention is Adriana Pina and she or Pina
I've never known which it is I just love
her and she I've known her I don't even
know when we first started like
contacting each other but I just think
she is a doll like she is literally one
of the nicest people I've ever talked to
and she has so much knowledge about
makeup but she's so chill about it and
she's so honest and real you'll notice
the trend like everyone on here is
honest and real but I just I think she's
beautiful and I love listening to her
talk another person I love to watch his
fancy that with Candice and she were
working on doing like some sort of
collab video actually I don't know when
this video is going up we might already
be up if it is i'll link it or it's
coming but I just like her she when I
first stumbled upon her channel I was
watching I don't even member what video
and I was like oh she's so cute I love
watching her so I watched a few more and
then finally I was going to subscribe
and I saw that she had not as many
subscribers as I would have guessed and
I was like what because her videos are
so professional like way more
professional than I will probably ever
be she is such a professional she is
absolutely beautiful and she's got two
kids
so like I don't know it just makes me
like her more I don't know why but that
always does and I just adore her another
person I wanted to mention is young wild
and polished
Nicole she I will sit there and be
getting ready and laughing out loud and
Tyler every once while he'll know I'm
watching a video and he'll be like what
are you laughing at and I'm like and
this this woman I'm just laughing at
this one she is so funny and it took me
a while to kind of warm up to her style
but once you kind of get her humor
I will she'll do these bloopers at the
end of most of her videos and she'll I
don't know how to describe him you just
have to see them but I will laugh til I
cry sometimes watching her she is
hilarious she's so so funny and she also
she's also decluttering so I'm like in
heaven right now because everyone I love
is decluttering and I love watching the
declutter videos who texts it's Tyler
filming he said what are you up to
filming novels anyway so the next person
I wanted to mention is Jordan or I think
her name is JJ Weezy but her name is
Jordan Cheyenne
she's just so she's a classic beauty
person to me like she's very she can get
really worked up in the cutest way about
makeup and I just love it and she's
always looking for like deals and things
like that which of course I love but I
just like her and she's she's not my
typical person that I would watch but I
just love her so I guess it doesn't
matter but she's very different than
most of the people i watch but i love
that about her and she's got an awesome
channel and her son is adorable okay
I've got oh my gosh I mention any way
too many people but I can't help but
there are people I just love so color
swept Beauty I don't even know her name
is it that terrible but she I recently
found her and I she's been doing this
like month of elf lately and I'm like
because I love elf so I've been watching
all of her elf videos but she's also
like a trainer or something like that
today was fitness so I love listening to
her talk about fitness things she does
my boo I'm like getting tips for fitness
from her as well so it's like a double
whammy
I love it I also love Tara babies II I
guess that's how you say it if you guys
haven't seen her make up question Who am
I kidding everyone has seen her make up
collection maybe you don't realize it's
her though she's the one that has that
makeup collection that's like she
literally uses like pink tool drawer
systems for all of her makeup because
she has so much
it is unbelievable it's so much fun to
watch it makes me feel better about my
collection like okay mine is not that
extensive but I have watched her makeup
collection videos like more times than I
want to admit it's like oh my gosh like
when you just need a makeup fix she is
who I watch and she I have bought so
many products that she has hauled she
really hurts my wallet but I just love
her and I think she's just so calming to
watch as well
the last gentleman I mentioned is not a
beauty channel but I don't care I
watched this channel called a theme park
and they do these Disney videos it's
kind of similar to what Tyler my fiance
does on his channel but it's just theme
parks and basically some of the videos
they'll put up I have no idea who like
runs that channel you never like see
them but they'll put up these videos
that are like just like walking through
say the Magic Kingdom at Disney World
you guys know I'm a Disney nerd so
they'll do like walkthroughs of it where
no one's like narrating or talking or
anything it's just you hear the sights
and sounds of the park and you just get
these beautiful sweeping shots for like
45 minutes of the whole park like every
nook and cranny I fall asleep watching
those all the time because they're so
relaxing and it's wonderful because of
course I love Disney so it makes me feel
like I'm there I think they do other
theme parks too I don't really know I
just watched the Disney ones but I love
watching it so I just had to mention it
because if you are a Disney nerd like me
you will love it so those are all the
ones I'm gonna mention today I have so
many more that I watch that I absolutely
adore but I just figured I would tell
you about at least those I if you'd like
to see another video like this let me
know it was certainly easy and fun to
film and it's always good to give credit
where credit is due and let people know
about these amazing ladies that I just
adore that deserve way more subscribers
than they have and yeah so if you're
interested in any other any of those
channels I will link all of their
channels below and if you enjoyed
please subscribe and I'll catch you guys
in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
