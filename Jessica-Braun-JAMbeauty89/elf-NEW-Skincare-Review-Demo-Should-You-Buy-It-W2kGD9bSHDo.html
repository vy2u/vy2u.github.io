bringing you a review of four different
products from elfs brand new skincare
line now they sent me these products in
the nick of time because I had been
trying out a few different serums and
different things that I bought and
something was breaking me out and I had
a tear I still have a terrible break out
here and literally the day after that
broke out in my chin broke out this came
in the mail and I was so excited to try
it I've been using it for almost a week
now and so far I really like it and of
course skincare is something that you
could try for a month
and still not know how you feel about it
because everyone's skin is different and
your skin takes some time to you know
for you to see results or to see how you
like it but so far I love this stuff and
I usually can tell pretty quickly how my
skin is reacting to different products
so I'm going to go through and show you
exactly how I use this skin care in what
order and then afterwards I'll go
through kind of the pros and cons of
whether or not I like these products and
would recommend them to you
okay so right now my skin condition is
pretty good other than this breakout
that I've got going on here this came
just in time so I was excited to try it
my skin has cleared up very quickly this
one's still working on it but it's I
mean it no longer hurts anymore and it's
it's going down I know it doesn't look
great but so before I started playing
the skincare I'm going to use another
elf favourite of mine it's the elf zit
zapper and this is salicylic acid based
and so it's just like a little
rollerball and you just kind of put it
on any blemishes I'm going to put a
little bit down here as well because I
had some breakouts there last week as
well
so you just kind of put it on there and
then just let it dry for a little bit
and then you can apply your serum which
is the actual step one so the very first
step is their smoothing serum and so it
just comes in a pump and it's more of a
lotion based serum which I've had I've
tried my hand at both kinds of serums
I've tried my hand at the kind that are
completely oils and some lotion Basin
honestly are kind of like both the idea
of a serum is that they are packed with
nutrients that are good for your face
and so you put that on your face before
you put on a moisturizer and you let it
sink in so I'm going to let this sink in
my face here for about a minute before I
apply the moisturizer so now that that
has sunk into my face and it no longer
really feels tacky I'm going to apply
the daily hydration moisturizer again
this one has a pump but it has a squeezy
tube with it and it is a lot thicker
than that serum was so I usually just
dot it onto my face I might need a
little more than that so now that that
is applied my skin looks a little greasy
err than it was because it is a
moisturizer but this really does sink in
well so I'm just going to wait a little
bit while it sinks in but in the
meantime I'm going to go ahead and apply
my illuminating eye cream and this one
comes in a jar and it is a nice thick
moisturizer meant to go and you really
don't need a ton because sometimes when
you over moisturize your under eye you
end up with like little Millia
little and I actually have some right
here I think from maybe over
moisturizing so I'm trying to make sure
I don't get too much but I also will be
dotting it up above your eyes because
you can see signs of aging up there as
well so all around like a little raccoon
how that one just feels so good so
before I would ever apply any primer or
foundation I would let all of this sink
in for a few minutes so usually this
would be the time that maybe I would
either dry my hair or go pick out my
outfit or whatever something that I
might need to do while this thinks and
maybe go get a cup of coffee I'm staring
at my cup of coffee the other product
that I'm not using right now because
it's for nighttime is the nourishing
night cream which is a much bigger jar
than the eye cream because of course you
use way less eye cream but it's in the
similar packaging and this one I've been
using at night and it might be my
favorite product out of all of them
because it is super super moisturizing
when I wake up in the morning my skin
just looks like it's already glowing
like before I put on any makeup or
anything it really is so so nice and
luxurious so now that you've seen kind
of how I apply it let's go through the
different pros and cons of these
products now the price point for these
are they
have range from $8 to $12 the hydrating
moisturizer is $8 the smoothing serum is
$12 the eye cream is $10 and then the
jar of the night cream is $12 now let's
go through packaging the ones that have
the pumps on them so the daily
moisturizer and the smoothing serum are
awesome
pumps are so wonderful for skin care
because when you've got a product in a
jar like these are you're constantly
every single day exposing them to light
to air to bacteria in the air and then
you're constantly dipping your hands
into them so whether or not I mean you'd
hope that people would clean their hands
before they put stuff on your face but
sometimes you don't or sometimes even
though you have washed your hands it
still got stuff on them so you're
putting that back into this every single
day and then you're putting that onto
your skin so that is something to keep
in mind when you're looking for skin
care
I would prefer things in pump packaging
for those reasons and the fact of the
matter is as well I'm light and air can
really mess with the ingredients in
these so that's another thing to think
about regardless the packaging itself is
really really pretty both these that
love that they're like mint green and I
mean they're beautiful packaging they
look very luxurious very high-end even
though of course they're not one thing I
also notice is that none of them have a
smell and that is so important in skin
care and I always dye a little bit and
I've done it I've guilty of it as well
when people will say oh my gosh this
lotion smells so good
well sometimes fragrance in skin care
can be really bad for your skin it can
be really drying or it can be really um
you know alcohol-based or it can just
mess with your skin break you out things
like that so in the past I've been
guilty of that but I've kind of gotten a
little bit wiser about my skincare and I
love that these don't have a smell that
tells me that they haven't added
perfumes or any other fragrances like
that to make it smell good but that
might not necessarily be good for my
skin the serum really blends so well
into the skin and serum is one of those
steps of skincare that most people
forget and I think to be able to buy
this for 10 or 12 dollars and it be
really really nice for your skin I've
noticed my skin tone is
just more even and my skin doesn't it's
not as dry and patchy oh my gosh I
really really really love this serum now
the daily moisturizer is also really
nice and it doesn't leave my skin
feeling greasy I mean you guys saw me
put it on and then of course I did all
my makeup today but it doesn't leave my
skin looking greasy or anything like
that so I really love that this
moisturizer for a daily moisturizer that
it sinks in within a couple minutes and
it doesn't leave your skin looking
greasy because that is the worst when
you have a moisturizer that you want to
put on every day but that leaves your
skin feeling gross now the one downside
is that this doesn't have SPF in it and
that's great for if you're taking photos
and you don't want that flash so like on
my wedding day I think I probably will
use this moisturizer because I don't
want any SPF to flash back in the flash
photography but for every single day use
I would say you know you're gonna have
to layer an SPF on it you should be for
your skin's sake for aging sake so that
is one downside but on the other hand
it's a really nice moisturizer so and
then the night cream in the eye cream
the eye cream like I said when I was
putting it on it feels so good putting
it on and my I've noticed my eyes just
look a little less tired in the morning
less crepey when I'm putting concealer
on and again this sinks into your eyes
or at least your skin quicker than most
eye cream so I feel comfortable putting
it on in the morning and let it sink
letting it sink in before putting
concealer on it doesn't end up making
the concealer look weird and the night
cream it's so lovely again it feels so
nice it's a really thick consistency and
it just I feel like all of this layered
together really is this beautiful
wonderful moisturizing treatment for my
face and again it feels so high-end and
yet it's not these are all sold
separately on their website eyes lips
face but I just looked and they also you
can buy the entire set of these four for
$42 now that seems like a lot of money
and even me saying that I'm like okay
$42 is a lot of money to just pay all at
once but when you look at you know
skincare that's out there that I mean
there are some eye creams that are
really really good just like
this one that or maybe even less that
come in the packaging that are $42 $50
$60 I mean people will pay so much money
for good skincare but you guys the
reality is you don't have to pay that
much I love this skincare I couldn't
believe I thought you know when I got it
in the mail you guys know I love elf I
do tons of reviews I love elf and I
always have but the reality is I thought
okay this is the first time they're
launching skincare and you know I don't
know I didn't really have high
expectations to be completely honest but
I was blown away by how moisturizing
these are how well packaged they are
other than the jars and how well they
work how well my skin has reacted to
them
and I love that they don't have
fragrance in them I mean across the
board this is amazing stuff and I'm not
affiliated with them I'm not sponsored
by them they sent me these things for
free but I could review them or I could
not it doesn't matter it's up to me what
I do so I'm not getting any kickback
whatsoever I just love this stuff so you
know if you're wanting a whole regimen
like what I showed you it is $42 on
their site and I'll put the links to all
this stuff below but they do sell each
of them separately for the prices that I
told you earlier so on their website
they always have coupon codes and I
always have a link for elf coupons below
that again I'll put there for you guys
there's always free shipping and there's
always you know 20% off or 50% off so
definitely wait to see a sale so you can
save even more money on these products
but these are amazing they're well worth
the money and I hope that this review is
helpful for you guys if you enjoyed

elf reviews which I will link my
playlist below and I'll catch you guys
