back to guys I mean I wish I could give
you the freaking world I really do not
know why possible I just want to give
something back to thank you guys
holy crap I am still like pinching
myself like is this is this legit right
now I was this actually happening two
weeks ago now we hit 1 million freaking
subscribers one me where have you come
from this is so mad I know this is super
cliche to say and everybody says this
but I never for a year and a half ago
well my masters me that a year and nine
months ago to be precise I never in a
million million million million years
thought that I'd be stuck here right now
first of all having YouTube as like what
I do it's my job now and second me
saying that we have reached 1 million I
don't want to babble on it for too long
I could actually just sit here and thank
you guys for like the rest of my life as
long as you guys know how much I
appreciate every single one of you
behind this little screen right here on
the bottom of my little heart honestly
thank you so much for all your love and
support but those girls and boys I would
not be here right now without you as
cliche as it sounds this is gonna be a
little bit of a cliche intro sorry about
that but it's so true it is so true as
deep as this sounds I started off as a
go he was nearly 18 who just wanted to
do something she loved escape the real
world like school for me and stuff was
never good and I just wanted that place
to escape where it was just me and I was
able to do what I love and just feel
happy for once I know that song so even
probably ridiculous to some of you but
that's what it was for me something I
loved it's such a passion for it and it
made me so happy and now that little
place that I started with has turned
into
what I actually do is the best feeling
ever and I can't thank you guys enough I
am just a normal girl and I wanted to
say that because I want to be living
proof for you that if you put your mind
to something do what you love be
determined and work hard dreams do come
true
that sounds really cheesy deal that was
it's true though right like this is my
dream and this was what made me happy
and I'm doing it so put your minds where
