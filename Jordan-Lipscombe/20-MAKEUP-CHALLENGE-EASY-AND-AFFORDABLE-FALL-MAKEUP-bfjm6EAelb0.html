all recognize me I know that I have been
super m.i.a on YouTube recently which is
totally unlike me I'm not going to bore
you with excuses but I mean if you do
follow me on my other social media
platforms like my snapchat Twitter
Instagram and then you will know why
I've basically just been in a little bit
of a funk yep cool though we all get
moments like that putting that aside I'm
back so today's video it's going to be
the 20 pound makeup challenge now this
was difficult to out your full face for
20 pound is not easy but what I also
found Mars was choosing makeup that I
actually think is good so I don't want
to just come in here and test out a
bunch of things and hope that it works
out I actually wanted to give you guys
really really affordable products that
are actually good if that makes sense
just so it's more beneficial to you I
don't think this video is going to be
helpful to a lot of people whether you
know you're a beginner at makeup or
you're just looking for some really good
affordable makeup so this look is what I
come up with
it was around 20 pounds ish don't you
exactly over on the screen here how much
it come up to so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if you want to see how I
did this look then keep watching okay so
the only thing I have done to my face so
far is I'll have filled in my brows
because you guys were throwing me this
morning you know my eyebrows need so
much doing sperm that they take like 10
times longer to fill in it's just like
that happened to me so I just decided to
do them on camera by didn't cheat I
promise
annoyingly all over but I just use the
Primark eyebrow pencil it's only a pound
it's the one we like the little spoon on
the end
um it just took me Oh since he is so may
skip primer because primer didn't fit my
plan account budget so we're going to
move straight on to foundation estimates
stay all day long lasting makeup in the
color 10 soft beige the rebound nothing
to complain about anything that don't
like butter foundation to shade range
it's just look what shape range there's
like not many iPhone it's just commish
stresses me out
I really really like about this
foundation is it has really really good
coverage I'd say like a good good
Mindy's not only that but it just lasts
a really long time on the skin as well
keep davon tip tip tip tip tip tip think
we're good are you taking on my
foundation tips I know I look like a
corpse right now but now if I concealer
I'm taking the LA girl Pro concealer
you've all heard about this because this
is long as you start your bond concealer
I use it like on the rag so good and
there's nothing the only thing about
this concealer is it does vary
price-wise but I get mine from eBay for
two pound fifty and it is like the legit
thing oh I am going hard the consider
today is going to blend that out I just
love this concealer I love her full
coverage in I love how they have so many
different shades as well those have like
color correctors they have basically
everything that you would want um it's
insane I don't know why Epic's now to
set my face
I'm going on with the MUA arm
translucent pressed powder this is only
a pound
so continue on cool book continuing on
with the skin I'm going to just add some
color or whatever so I'm going in with
the makeup revolution ultra Scott and
console care this is in affair so it
comes with a bronzer blush and highlight
so it's all in one which is good and
it's only three pound fifty and I
genuinely love every single one because
this stuff is pigmented by the way I
just turned over the blush now you might
be a lot of um not all of them but it's
got that kind of like Goldie Goldie ah
tree flexi bits in it you don't you you
know what I mean I feel like you
wouldn't even need to wear highlight
with this like the gold in it really
shows for I don't know if it's picking
up on camera but in real life you get
like a really nice glow to the skin but
I mean I'm so extra I'm going to
highlight anyway so I'm just going to go
in and take the the middle highlight
shade from that same palette and we're
just going to go crazy you basically
this highlight is just so good though
look look at that oh thank you to find a
palette with a highlight of this good in
a bowl you know it's going to do my
idols to options so these are the makeup
revolution palette now these are four
pounds each I obviously just can use one
of the most societies which one to use
your I think I may go for this one so
this is the redemption that palette icon
x3 so this is the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette troop I think yes long ago like
the one with all of the like pinks in
and stuff are so pretty I'm just going
to go in with this white or ivory shirt
here and just set my am eyelids with
this want to see these eyeshadows are so
good for four pounds you are se can't go
wrong really pigmented really easy to
blend
I think make it revolution freedom all
of that group of brands have the best
drugstore eye shadows in my opinion
yeah I'm going to switch over to your
voiceover Jordan now just to save a
little bit of time while I do my eyes
so the 5km taking is at the end kind of
dark perfectly brown color we're just
going to pack that on the outer corner I
know this is where to do first but I
wanted it to be really soft and blended
so I wanted obviously to do it fast then
I can blend everything into it and now
I'm just taking a big fluffy brush and
I'm just going to blend those outer
corners out and now I'm going in with
this middle kind of light brown shade
and also that bronzer from that palette
we used earlier just add a bit of warmth
I'm just working that into the crease
and obviously into the outer corner dark
brown color and then I'm going back in
with a little bit of that dark brown
just to intensify a little bit more just
because obviously where we've blended it
it's kind of lost that color a little
bit and then I'm going to go in with the
white ivory shade at least in the
beginning and just practice only kind of
inner corners of the lids just to
brighten the eyes okay so it's keep in
budget I have choose between eyeliner or
mascara and much going to go for mascara
even though I've actually managed to
include lashes in this video I can't not
blend in my eyelashes with the false
ones because I look like freakin I look
crazy
when is the primer one I don't know they
have like a billion I'm just like a
one-pound mascara from Primark like okay
we're just going to let it dry do it
sorry five is bringing my like DIY side
out I could always use mascara or
eyeliner not going to do up today
because in that kind of video but
options so now I have quite long lashes
but you guys know I'm a collage junkie I
love I love false eyelashes you see so
the lashes I'm going to use today
actually from eBay they are two pounds
fifty they look like this they kind of
look like the red cherry one so this is
what they look like they're just like
wispy and long and sorry I just love
these lashes so much like I said they
are from either leave the link below
honestly I think my favorite lashes over
there so like cheap which is good for me
because I lose my lashes all the time
here with me who's with me
that's just so pretty - I have like
eight pairs or something at the moment
new discovery and I feel like I need to
autumn more just because like if I run
out
for lips I have chosen to go for like a
dark glossy red and I'm excited to use
this because the only thing I haven't
used yet I've used it in a different
color but I've not tried this one so
this is the Primark this is their PS lip
duo matte lipstick and gloss so on one
end you have lipstick and then on the
other is like your little pot of gloss
look how cool is that
and this is only 2 pounds 50 I'm gonna
go show you with the lipstick didn't
have enough for a lip liner so I'm
hoping that this goes okay so just pray
for me please excuse me miss application
arm you definitely need lip liner but
I'm this color I love it I want to make
it like a glossy lip though I'm going to
put the glossners R I'm going to like
give it a swatch to see how pigmented is
it can you see her oh my gosh
so this is the completed look I hope you
