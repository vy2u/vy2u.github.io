am just so so excited so literally two
days ago now I reached 200,000
subscribers like I'm honestly still
trying to come to terms with the fact
that this has actually happened to me I
I don't get it like what is he don't
know what to say like thank you guys so
much for making this happen because I
wouldn't be doing this without you guys
and thank you to every single person who
has supported my channel in any way
whether it was from day one which was
like seven months ago or yesterday
because it just means the absolute world
to me I just want you guys to know that
I am and will forever be so so so
grateful so I love you guys anyway I'm
going to shut up now before I start
getting emotional about this whole
situation we don't want to deal with
emotional donor so this is my 200,000
subscriber giveaway oh my god that feels
so weird to say that I just wanted to
give back to you guys because you've
done so much for me and I know this
doesn't compare like it is no we're in
the same league as what you guys have
done for me like I wish I could give you
everything if I can so I just want to
give back to you guys in some kind of
way so there is just so there is so much
stuff in this box and it's so heavy so
basically I just chose a bunch of stuff
that I love for this giveaway just
because I know it's all good so I hope
the person that wins this loves it as
much as I do so the rules to ends are
actually pretty simple and standard so
the first one is of course be subscribed
to my channel because of course I want
to give away to my subscribers the
second one is to be following me on my
Instagram and the third is to make sure
you're following me on my snapchat so
subscribe to my channel and follow me on
Instagram and snapchat that's literally
the only rules that apply to this
giveaway I will also be checking so I
will leave all the information in the
description box below so make sure you
check that out before entering just to
make sure everything is clear and but
it's pretty simple anyway also this is a
worldwide kind of giveaway so it's not
just people in the UK so you all have a
chance because I feel like it's fair
that way right I'm just going to jump in
and show you guys what you have the
chance of winning so the first thing you
could be winning is the
pencak a electric palette I won't open
or anything because obviously it's not
mine but these other colors on the back
this is so pretty I just thought this
would be pretty cool to include because
I'm sure a lot of you don't have
palettes with like these kind of colors
in so it's something different
two of my favorite NYX lingerie liquid
lipsticks one is in the color bedtime
Fleur and the other is in satin ribbon
I'm actually wearing these a bow for my
lips now of course you might get my ones
you will get brand new ones but this is
like my favorite lipstick combo ever
someone will also be getting the sleek
solstice highlighting palette this is my
one of course yours will be brand new
and but this is like one of my favorite
highlighting palettes ever wearing it
today love it the next thing out for you
guys is this toothbrush brush set like
the for the full set eyes face the lot
this is my one so I do have a set myself
and I have it in this little acrylic
stand which you will be getting the
acrylic stand as well so how cool is
that you actually get the brushes and
the stand as well because these are kind
of awkward to store because of the shape
I feel like so the fact that you can
have a little acrylic holder as well is
so cool I am actually playing on filming
a video using these if you guys are
interested in seeing that so if you do
win this there's gonna be a little video
to help you out I mean in the video you
can just buy a set yourself but like why
not try and win one for yourself and I
have a bunch of stuff from the body shop
so the first two I have are the
lightening and darkening drops these are
amazing if you have a foundation that
doesn't quite match you or if you fake
tan like me and your shade goes up and
down all the time these are lifesavers
I've used a lightening ones in my video
before and I'm like obsessed a couple of
the body shop of body butters in the
coconut one this smells incredible and
this is like one of my favorite body
moisturizers ever so two of those one of
the body shop and vitamin C ten-day glow
boosting a concentrate when your skin is
having one of those days where it's just
like oh you need one of these and then
two of they're like new luxury candles
these smell incredible I think
everything from the body shop to going
to smells good to me they are like
really big as well so I think they last
a really long time and they leave your
room just smelling amazing like I mean
who just
candles and then there's a bunch of
stuff from this L because lizzo is
actually one of my favorite skincare
brands so the first thing here is the
list L hot cloth cleanse and polish this
is one of my favorite things from this L
ever this is one of the best makeup
removing kind of tools you do get
obviously the actual product in here and
then a couple of the cloths to go with
it as well this is the instant boost
skin tonic spritzer this always leaves
my skin feeling so refreshed I just want
to be like constantly spraying on my
face you could also win the gentle phase
exfolia too as well I love this because
it just is like a nice exfoliant and
it's not too hard and it doesn't leave
my skin feeling like I've already dry or
kind of sore afterwards so that lensing
mask yeah and you do get the little kind
of sponge in here as well in the little
bag just kind of like whizzing through
these because I read on this video to be
long
but the next one is the Liz L I bright
soothing eye lotion this is like a
really thin liquid which is nice it's
nothing too heavy underneath the eyes
the skin repair moisturizer this is for
normal such combination skin
but I mean even if you have any other
skin type there's like enough products
in here to cater for anybody but this
one I just thought was like middle of
the range another mask this is the
brightening of treatment masks I love
masks I don't think you can have enough
of them in my opinion so and this is the
super skin face serum they're kind of
super skin arranged the one that's all
in the silver packaging is so luxurious
so I had to include one of my favorite
products from that line and this is one
of them and the last thing I have for
this giveaway I wish I could give you
guys so much more but we do have to stop
at some point
it is the Liz OH their 20-year perfume
if you guys follow me on snapchat you
would have seen that I actually have one
of these myself besides this is 50ml but
by the way everything in this video is
like full-size products so that is
everything after this giveaway like I
said I will leave in the description box
below all the details so how to enter
it's really really easy though it's
literally only three things and again it
is worldwide because I wanted all of my
subscribers do have a chance to win this
so I hope you guys are as excited about
this as I am so I wish you guys the best
of luck I love you and I will see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
